        "mainbody": "The astrolabe of Nimbral was a powerful, greater artifact that allowed someone skilled in its use to teleport a large object, and everything and everyone inside, anywhere on the planet.\nThe astrolabe was as a large, unwieldy apparatus that appeared as a cross between a pipe organ and a printing press. It had many levers and knobs that facilitated its use.\nAfter its creation in Nimbral, the astrolabe was stored in the vaults of the Nimbral lords for many years. Some time before 1372 DR it was stolen by a group led by the Halruaan wizard Dwalimar Omen and taken to Halruaa. He installed the cumbersome machination on his skyship the Realms Master where it was used to search Toril for artifacts for the Netyarch Zalathorm Kirkson.\nThe extent of the powers of teleportation possessed by the astrolabe was beyond most other items in Faer√ªn. It could move an object as large as a ship or tower, up to 20,000 cu. ft in volume, anywhere on Toril.\nIt took tremendous knowledge of the arcane to properly operate the machine. If someone used it without understanding, they could transport their target object up to 500 miles away from the desired location."
