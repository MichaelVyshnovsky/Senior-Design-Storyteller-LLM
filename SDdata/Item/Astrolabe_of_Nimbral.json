        "mainbody": "The '''''astrolabe of Nimbral''''' was a powerful, greater [[artifact]] that allowed someone skilled in its use to teleport a large object, and everything and everyone inside, anywhere on the planet.",
        "Appearance": "The ''astrolabe'' was as a large, unwieldy apparatus that appeared as a cross between a [[pipe organ]] and a [[printing press]]. It had many levers and knobs that facilitated its use.",
        "History": "After its creation in [[Nimbral]], the ''astrolabe'' was stored in the vaults of the [[Nimbral lords]] for many years. Some time before [[1372 DR]] it was stolen by a group led by the [[Halruaan]] [[wizard]] [[Dwalimar Omen]] and taken to [[Halruaa]]. He installed the cumbersome machination on his [[Halruaan skyship|skyship]] the ''[[Realms Master]]'' where it was used to search Toril for artifacts for the [[Netyarch]] [[Zalathorm Kirkson]].",
        "Powers": "The extent of the powers of teleportation possessed by the ''astrolabe'' was beyond most other items in [[Faerûn]]. It could move an object as large as a ship or tower, up to 20,000 cu. ft in volume, anywhere on [[Toril]].\n\nIt took tremendous knowledge of the [[arcane magic|arcane]] to properly operate the machine. If someone used it without understanding, they could transport their target object up to 500 miles away from the desired location."
