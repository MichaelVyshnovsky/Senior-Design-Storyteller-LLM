(bag) (bean)
A bag of beans was a rare magical item.
The bag looked like a regular small sack and was made from heavy cloth. 
The bag contained dried beans, which looked like regular ordinary beans but they contained powerful magical properties. If a bean was dropped on the ground, it exploded in a brilliant fireball. 
The owner of the bag had no way of knowing what power a bean held. But if a bean was planted, the magical properties were revealed. The magical effects of the beans ranged from minor to incredibly powerful. 
The known magical properties of the beans are listed below
* Spawn a treant, although there was a risk it would be evil.
* Summon an aggressive bulette.
* Create a patch of toadstool mushrooms.
* Create a statue that resembled the individual who planted the bean. It was rooted in place but for a day it was animate, and was verbally aggressive towards the individual who planted the bean.
* Create a tree bearing fruit. The fruit had the effect of various potions.
* Create a large pyramid, which contained a mummy lord.
* Sprout a patch of shriekers.
* Create a campfire of blue flame that burned for a full day.
* Summon a geyser of liquid. The liquid could be water, beer, juice, tea or even oil.
* Sprout a gigantic beanstalk.
