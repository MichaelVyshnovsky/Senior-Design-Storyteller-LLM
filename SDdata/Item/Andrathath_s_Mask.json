        "mainbody": "'''''Andrathath's Mask''''' was a powerful [[artifact]].",
        "Description": "The mask was a skintight, glittering black face-mask with two eyeholes that was made of sheer silver and black [[silk]]. It covered the entire head and bonded slightly with the skin around the eyes, cheekbones, and lips. It held an [[obsidian]] [[gem]] between the eyeholes. It was tight enough to obscure facial features, while disguising the subject's voice as a hollow monotone.",
        "Powers": "The artifact's powers changed depending on its wearer, unlocking more powers for a more powerful one. Some of its known powers included the usage, four times daily, of ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[Find traps|detect traps]]'', and ''[[true seeing]]''. For mages, it granted them a handful of extra spells per day to those they could cast, though none of the spells was of the same power as the others. Anyone who wore it at least three hours a day for a year gained 20 years of lifespan, up to a maximum of 800 years.\n\nHowever, it had some complications. Anyone who wore the mask for so much as a month would be at risk of having chaos overtaking their personality; after a year, it was a sure thing. The mask granted spells to its wearer by covering their face while they slept, and if not worn to sleep, it would crawl on its own towards their faces while they slept. The mask was extremely possessive of its wearer, too, and was very likely to ''[[feeblemind]]'' someone other than its owner that put it on. In the case it accepted its new master instead, the previous owner's increased lifespan was instantly cancelled, risking turning them into dust. Though not truly sentient, it was semi-sentient, and communicated through empathic flashes.",
        "History": "[[Andrathath]] wore the mask until at most {{yearlink|-150}}, as he had not worn it for over 800 years as of {{yearlink|650}}. It was found on his face when his body, soulless and dead, was found at [[Dlardrageth Keep]].\n\nThe next confirmed wearer of the mask was [[Llombaerth Starym]], who wore it until his death in the {{yearlinkName|261}}.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|337|19}} The mask was later worn by [[Elminster]], who then gave it to a mysterious female [[elf]] or [[half-elf]] attested only as \"[[The Masked]]\", who wore it until at least 650 DR. At that time, the mask had had seven wearers known to the elves of [[Myth Drannor]], which almost certainly included The Masked, Elminster Aumar, Llombaerth Starym, and Andrathath.\n\nThe artifact later resurfaced in the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, worn by [[Marune]] of the [[Shadow Thieves]], who acquired the mask sometime prior to {{yearlink|1255}} whilst plundering a tower in the [[Lost Peaks]]. He had the mask until at least {{yearlink|1372}}.",
        "Reputation": "It was believed Andrathath's intellect could still be within the mask, manipulating its owners.\n\nOther rumored powers of the mask included unerring rays of fire shot from the eyes, the ability to possess an unconscious wearer to make them flee from danger, complete undetectability, and more. Many of those powers had not been activated for over 800 years as of 650 DR.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Andrathath]]\n* [[Llombaerth Starym]]\n* [[Elminster Aumar]]\n* [[The Masked]]\n* [[Marune]]"
