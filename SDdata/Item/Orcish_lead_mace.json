        "mainbody": "Orcish lead mace was the extremely heavy and powerful bludgeon that belonged to Mol the Great circa 1369 DR.\nThis lead mace of orcish make was crudely crafted and, apart from its weight, was unremarkable.\nThe size and weight of this curious bludgeon made it harder to hit its target, but when it didd connect, it dealt bone-shattering damage.\nIn 1369 DR, this orcish lead mace was in the hands of Mol the Great, an orcish captain who resided in the ruins of Myth Drannor and led a group of loyal orcs against his opponent, chieftain Zud. Eventually both ruthless orcs were slain by the group of adventurers from Phlan who sought to end the Cult of the Dragons plans of domination via the magics of Myth Drannors mythal. When Mol was killed, the mace fell out of his hand and loudly cracked the stonework floor under its weight, attracting the adventurers attention."
