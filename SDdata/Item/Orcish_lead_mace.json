        "mainbody": "'''''Orcish lead mace''''' was the extremely heavy and powerful bludgeon that belonged to [[Mol the Great]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "This lead [[mace]] of [[orc|orcish]] make was crudely crafted and, apart from its weight, was unremarkable.",
        "Powers": "The size and weight of this curious bludgeon made it harder to hit its target, but when it didd connect, it dealt bone-shattering damage.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], this ''orcish lead mace'' was in the hands of Mol the Great, an orcish captain who resided in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] and led a group of loyal orcs against his opponent, chieftain [[Zud]]. Eventually both ruthless orcs were slain by the group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] who sought to end the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s plans of domination via the magics of Myth Drannor's ''[[mythal]]''. When Mol was killed, the mace fell out of his hand and loudly cracked the stonework floor under its weight, attracting the adventurers' attention."
