'''''Rods of resurrection''''' were a legendary type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[rod]] that could be found in the Realms.

==Description==
The ''rod of resurrection'' typically had [[humanoid]] faces carved into each of its thicker ends, with [[jet]]s used for eyes and [[ruby|rubies]] for lips. Over the slender end of a rod there would be an [[amethyst]] bound.

Some of the ''rods of resurrection'' used in [[Myth Drannor]] were shaped out of black glass and tipped with a clear tip.

==Abilities==
This rod allowed its wielder to resurrect the dead, producing an effect similar to the [[spell]] ''[[resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]''. In earlier ages only [[cleric]]s could activate the power of these rods and they were incapable of regaining charges.

Following the [[Spellplague]], [[druid]]s and [[paladin]]s were also capable of attuning to these rods. In addition, they could now be used to cast ''[[heal]]'' and they regained a single expended charge each dawn. However, if a ''rod of resurrection's'' charges were completely used up, there was a small chance that it would disappear in a burst of radiant energy.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a ''rod of resurrection'' was one of many [[magic item]]s that the [[wizard]] [[Lhaeo]] gifted to a group of [[adventurer]]s after they escaped from the [[Tower of Ashaba]]. Around that same time a ''rod of resurrection'' laid within the [[Temple of Torm's Coming]].

In [[1359 DR]],{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|29-30}} on behalf of the wizard [[Flamsterd]] a [[weredragon]] named [[Shaleen (weredragon)|Shaleen]] gifted one of these rods alongside many other magical items to a group of adventurers that were fighting the [[Church of Bane|Risen Cult of Bane]].

In [[1369 DR]], both the merchants [[Karthis al-Hezzar]]<ref> and [[Ribald Barterman]] had a ''rod of resurrection'' for sale in their respective stores.<ref> During the same period of time, some of the ancient ''wands of resurrection'' were looted from the ruins of Myth Drannor by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] members, as well as by friendly traders of the [[ormyrr]] tribe that took residence there.

==Construction==
These rods could be constructed by using a {{SI|3|ft}} branch from a [[rowan]] tree that was under the care of a [[treant]]. Following the physical construction of a staff, one needed to wrap the root of a [[mandrake]] over the bound amethyst, binding it with a cloth soaked in one's own blood, and then wrapping that with silver wires. One then needed a special set of [[robe]]s, [[incense]], and a structure erected specifically for the enchantment ceremony. Once the ceremony was complete, a command word would issue forth from the mandrake root.{{Cite dragon/101/Charging isn't cheap|30}}
