Ruavias Steed was an enchanted necklace from the island of Evermeet.
The pendant of the necklace was shaped like an ebony horse.
The wearer of the necklace could use its magic to summon a random steed that would remain for the entire day. Only one creature could be summoned per day and it needed to be ridden by only the wearer of the necklace. Possible mounts included a pegasus, unicorn, light warhorse, heavy warhorse, giant eagle, ki-rin, lammasu, and an asperii.
