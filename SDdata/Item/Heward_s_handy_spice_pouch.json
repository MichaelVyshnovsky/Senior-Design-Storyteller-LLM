        "mainbody": "'''''Heward's handy spice pouch''''' was a magic [[pouch]] that was able to produce any food seasoning.",
        "Description": "The item resembled an ordinary, empty belt pouch.",
        "Powers": "Someone holding the pouch could reach into it and speak the name of any type of nonmagical seasoning&mdash;[[salt]], [[pepper]], [[saffron]] etc.&mdash;and produce enough of that seasoning to apply to a single meal. This power could be used up to ten times until the pouch recovered its magic at the next dawn."
