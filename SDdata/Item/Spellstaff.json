        "mainbody": "spellstaff was an enchanted elven quarterstaff wielded by the inhabitants of ancient Myth Drannor.\nA spellstaff was a  oaken quarterstaff but was as light as a piece of balsa wood. The surface of the weapon was covered in glyphs and runes resembling flames and bolts of electricity.\nA spellstaff could be wielded as a sturdy implement of battle but it was enchanted to catch, absorb, and store lightning bolts, fireballs, and similar fire and lightning spells. The wielder could release stored destructive magics at a target with a simple double-tap.\nIn the , a member of the Veiled Ones adventuring group, Ghleanna Stormlake, received a spellstaff from the baelnorn Miroden Silverblade. The defender of the mythal gifted the ancient weapon to the half-elven sorceress after she suffered numerous shocks and burns from the Cult of the Dragon mages. Later, the staff was instrumental in the groups battle against the leader of the cult, Kya Mordrayn. The Wearer of Purple sent a crackling lightning bolt toward Ghleanna, allowing her to absorb the spell, returning it back on Mordrayn, and badly burning her flesh. The staff was also instrumental in protecting her allies from the fiery breath of the cults dracolich, Pelendralaar. Instead of incinerating the adventurers, Ghleannas spellstaff absorbed the dragons flames. Under such stress, the weapon started to smoke, and its glyphs blazed brightly."
