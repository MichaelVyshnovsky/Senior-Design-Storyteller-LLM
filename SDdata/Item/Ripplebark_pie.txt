Ripplebark pie was a variety of Duergar pie made using the flesh of unappetizing ripplebark fungi.
As of the late 15 century DR, expensive  servings of ripplebark pie were sold by Gorstaf, a rude duergar baker from the city of Gracklstugh in the Underdark in northwest Faer√ªn. Despite its exotic ingredients, ripplebark pies appeared to be quite ordinary and appetizing.
