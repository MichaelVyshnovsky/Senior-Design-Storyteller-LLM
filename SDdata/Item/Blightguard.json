        "mainbody": "'''''Blightguard''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]] created imbued with magics of the [[Wood Man]].",
        "Powers": "The shield possessed a powerful ''+4'' defensive enchantment. When the shield was wielded against [[plant creature]]s, it effectively became a ''+8'' item. Additionally, the wielder of ''Blightguard'' had their physical strength boosted dramatically as long as they held the shield in their hands.",
        "History": "''Blightguard'' was created ages before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the spirit of [[Ashenwood]] â€“ the Wood Man, when it was at peak power. The shield was believed to be powered by the forest itself.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the tower shield found its way into possession of a [[Rashemaar]] [[berserker]] named [[Odesya]] stationed in the Ashenwood's [[Lake of Tears Garrison]], a Rashemi fort led by a [[wychlaran]] [[Dalenka]]."
