        "mainbody": "Blightguard was an enchanted tower shield created imbued with magics of the Wood Man.\nThe shield possessed a powerful +4 defensive enchantment. When the shield was wielded against plant creatures, it effectively became a +8 item. Additionally, the wielder of Blightguard had their physical strength boosted dramatically as long as they held the shield in their hands.\nBlightguard was created ages before the 14 century DR by the spirit of Ashenwood â€“ the Wood Man, when it was at peak power. The shield was believed to be powered by the forest itself.\nBy the , the tower shield found its way into possession of a Rashemaar berserker named Odesya stationed in the Ashenwoods Lake of Tears Garrison, a Rashemi fort led by a wychlaran Dalenka."
