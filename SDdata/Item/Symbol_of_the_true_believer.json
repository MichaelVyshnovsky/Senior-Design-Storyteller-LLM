        "mainbody": "'''''Symbols of the true believer''''' were powerful ''[[holy symbol]]s'' used by [[cleric]]s of the [[Church of Lathander]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "These ancient trinkets were imbued with powerful [[divine]] magic that boosted the owner's attacking power and guided their weapons toward the targets. When an owner of a ''symbol of the true believer'' faced an [[undead]] creature, their damage output was dramatically increased, equal to an offensive ''+5'' enchantment. When the owner scored an especially powerful and lucky strike on their opponents, their ''symbol of the true believer'' imbued the attack with additionally damaging [[radiant]] energy. These ''holy symbols'' also doubled the owner's proficiency with healing magic.",
        "History": "In the late-15{{th}} century DR, a ''symbol of the true believer'' could be recovered from a bandits' camp run by [[wizard]] [[Desram]], hidden in the [[Sword Mountains]], later raided by adventurers in service of [[Neverwinter]]. Another such ''holy symbol'' was stashed in the ruins of [[Illefarn]] among other treasures of the [[vampire lord]] named [[Ozit]]."
