        "mainbody": "ymbols of the true believer were powerful holy symbols used by clerics of the Church of Lathander in the 15 century DR.\nThese ancient trinkets were imbued with powerful divine magic that boosted the owners attacking power and guided their weapons toward the targets. When an owner of a symbol of the true believer faced an undead creature, their damage output was dramatically increased, equal to an offensive +5 enchantment. When the owner scored an especially powerful and lucky strike on their opponents, their symbol of the true believer imbued the attack with additionally damaging radiant energy. These holy symbols also doubled the owners proficiency with healing magic.\nIn the late-15 century DR, a symbol of the true believer could be recovered from a bandits camp run by wizard Desram, hidden in the Sword Mountains, later raided by adventurers in service of Neverwinter. Another such holy symbol was stashed in the ruins of Illefarn among other treasures of the vampire lord named Ozit."
