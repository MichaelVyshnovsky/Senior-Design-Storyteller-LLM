        "mainbody": "Chaunteas Golden Grain were three pieces of enchanted golden grain that were grifted as a boon by the Church of Chauntea.\nThese golden grains were fashioned by the clerics of Chauntea and imbued with powers to protect the user from one of natures perils. Each grain could be used only once, after which it crumbled to dust. When activated, each piece allowed for casting one of the following spells hold animal, neutralize poison, and vine mine.\nIn 1372 DR, one set of these seeds was gifted to Fernd Krip, the miller from Daggerfords Eastern Farmlands. When he was driven mad by a conniving slaad, Chaunteas Golden Grains were tossed into the rat-infested basement of the mill."
