        "Powers": "These golden grains were fashioned by the [[cleric]]s of [[Chauntea]] and imbued with powers to protect the user from one of nature's perils. Each grain could be used only once, after which it crumbled to dust. When activated, each piece allowed for casting one of the following spells: ''[[hold animal]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', and ''[[vine mine]]''.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], one set of these seeds was gifted to [[Fernd Krip]], the miller from [[Daggerford]]'s [[Eastern Farmlands]]. When he was driven mad by a conniving [[slaad]], ''Chauntea's Golden Grains'' were tossed into the [[rat]]-infested basement of the mill."
