'''''Thirsty sand''''' was a [[magical sand]] originating in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, that possessed magical properties similar to ''[[dust of dryness]]''.{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}}

==Powers==
''Thirsty sand'' drained water from nearby living creatures. This sand caused excruciating pain from massive dehydration to a single target. The sand would fall into clumps around the victim's feet after draining water from them. Additional handfuls of this sand could be thrown at the same target, causing even more harm. A full gallon of water needed to be consumed to replenish the water stolen by the sand.

''Thirsty sand'' was especially deadly to any [[Water|water-based]] creatures.
