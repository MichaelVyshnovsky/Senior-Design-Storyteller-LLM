        "mainbody": "'''Crampons''' were a tool designed for the purpose of aiding in the transversal of icy, snowy, and mountainous terrain.",
        "Description": "Crampons were plates of metal, embedded with spikes and hooks. They were attached to the soles of [[shoe]]s or [[boot]]s, or to the side of [[gauntlet]]s, with several straps of leather.\n\nThey were often made of [[steel]] and typically sold in pairs. However, crampons could also be constructed from the supplies found in most [[climbing kit]]s.",
        "Powers": "Attaching crampons to a pair of boots would increase their traction. This improved a wearer's ability to climb up mountainous terrain or walk across icy surfaces. This traction also gave wearers more stable footing on slick and slippery surfaces.",
        "Availability": "* In [[Athkatla]], one could find crampons for sale at the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"Duty\">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item featured in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.\n* The [[Iron Bull Smithy]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold crampons for 4 [[gold piece]]s.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/103/The Living City: The Horse Businesses|16}}\n* In [[Zhentil Keep]], one could find crampons for sale at [[Lita's Equipment]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"Lita\">''[[Ruins of Zhentil Keep]]'' states that everything from the ''Arms and Equipment Guide'', except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Lita's Equipment.",
        "Notable Users of Crampons": "* Crampons were one of many types of climbing equipment that [[thieves]] were known to utilize.\n* On [[Oyaviggaton]], the [[kobold]] servants of [[Arauthator]] were known to wear crampons made from animal teeth on their boots in order to easily traverse the [[white dragon]]'s iceberg lair."
