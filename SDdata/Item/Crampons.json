        "mainbody": "Crampons were a tool designed for the purpose of aiding in the transversal of icy, snowy, and mountainous terrain.\nCrampons were plates of metal, embedded with spikes and hooks. They were attached to the soles of shoes or boots, or to the side of gauntlets, with several straps of leather.\nThey were often made of steel and typically sold in pairs. However, crampons could also be constructed from the supplies found in most climbing kits.\nAttaching crampons to a pair of boots would increase their traction. This improved a wearers ability to climb up mountainous terrain or walk across icy surfaces. This traction also gave wearers more stable footing on slick and slippery surfaces.\n* In Athkatla, one could find crampons for sale at the market Waukeens Promenade.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* The Iron Bull Smithy in Ravens Bluff sold crampons for 4 gold pieces.\n* In Zhentil Keep, one could find crampons for sale at Litas Equipment.Ruins of Zhentil Keep states that everything from the Arms and Equipment Guide, except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Litas Equipment.\n* Crampons were one of many types of climbing equipment that thieves were known to utilize.\n* On Oyaviggaton, the kobold servants of Arauthator were known to wear crampons made from animal teeth on their boots in order to easily traverse the white dragons iceberg lair."
