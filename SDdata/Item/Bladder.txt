'''Bladders''' were [[animal]] bladders that could be inflated to be enjoyed as children's toys, employed as [[bard]]ic props,

==Description==
While they could vary in size, the most popular bladders for entertainment purposes were from [[pig]]s, and could be inflated to the size of a [[human]] head. Bladders could be inflated with air or water. With air, they could be tied to a string, released to splutteringly fly around, or popped to produce a loud noise. With water, there was little more that could be done save for throwing them, although children could reliably devise more mischievous uses.

Bladders were useful for causing diversions or distractions.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], bladders were sold as bardic equipment from [[Aurora's Emporium]], where they cost 1 [[gold piece]] per five pig bladders. such as ''[[deep breath]]'' or ''[[steal breath]]''.
