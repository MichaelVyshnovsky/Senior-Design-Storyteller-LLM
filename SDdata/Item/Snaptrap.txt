Snaptraps were small traps in the Realms used to dissuade pursuers by forcing them to slow down to avoid the traps or risk being harmed when stepping on them.
Snaptraps resembled small hunting traps.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue as a bag of 100 traps for 5 gold pieces.
* Snaptraps were often used by thieves or rogues who tossed them on the ground behind them to aid in their escapes.
