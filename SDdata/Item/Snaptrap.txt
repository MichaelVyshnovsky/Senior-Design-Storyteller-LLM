'''Snaptraps''' were small traps in the Realms used to dissuade pursuers by forcing them to slow down to avoid the traps or risk being harmed when stepping on them.

==Description==
Snaptraps resembled small [[hunting trap]]s.

==History==
These items were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' as a bag of 100 traps for 5 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Users==
* Snaptraps were often used by [[thieves]] or [[rogues]] who tossed them on the ground behind them to aid in their escapes.
