Bluecap pie was a variety of Duergar pie made using the flesh of bluecap fungi.
As of the late 15 century DR, expensive  servings of bluecap pie were sold by Gorstaf, a rude duergar baker from the city of Gracklstugh in the Underdark in northwest Faer√ªn. Despite bluecap mushrooms being quite mundane, the pies looked lumpy and misshapen, making them appear unappetizing.
