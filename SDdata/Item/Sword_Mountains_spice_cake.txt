'''Sword Mountains spice cakes''' were unassuming handfoods, packed with head-clearing [[spices]] and drizzled with sweet glaze.

==Powers==
These bite-sized bundt-shaped cakes were cooked with such quantity of spices that they put pep in the imbiber's step and increased their initiative and reaction in critical situations.

==History==
In the mid-to-late-15{{th}} century [[DR]], Sword Mountains spice cakes made their way from the villages of the [[Sword Mountains]] into the city of [[Neverwinter]], becoming popular among its adventuring population. These invigorating handfoods were also served at the [[Beached Leviathan]] tavern of the city's [[Blacklake District]].
