        "mainbody": "'''''Crossbows of the High Forest''''' were [[enchanted]] [[light crossbow]]s often credited to the [[Church of Mielikki]].",
        "Powers": "Unlike many other enchanted ''+4'' weapons, ''crossbows of the High Forest'' did not deal more damage; instead, they greatly aided the weapon's aim. Additionally, these weapons granted the wielder magical healing through minor ''[[regeneration]]''.",
        "History": "''Crossbows of the High Forest'' were created sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the [[Underwood Company]] of the High Forest in [[northwest Faer√ªn]]. Since then, many confused the items for being of divine origin, owing to the powerful magics imbued into ''crossbows of the High Forest''. In the late 14{{th}} century DR, most attributed the creation of these crossbows to the goddess [[Mielikki]] herself and could be found in several locations along the [[Sword Coast]] and in the city of [[Elventree]] in the [[Moonsea]] region."
