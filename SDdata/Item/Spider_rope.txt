'''''Spider ropes''''' were a variety of enchanted [[rope]]s{{Cite dragon/256/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Tools of the Trade|90}}

==Description==
These stout ropes were mundane in appearance and in their unactivated state measured no more than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Powers==
Twice per day, a ''spider rope'' could be verbally [[command word|commanded]] by a wielder to increase its length and attach itself to an inanimate object. ''Spider ropes'' could increase their length to up to {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} and would remain at that length indefinitely until their owner commanded them to return to their original length.

''Spider ropes'' attached themselves to inanimate objects, no more than two, by tying their ends around the targeted object(s). If one were to ever tie a ''spider rope'' around something manually though, the rope would swiftly untie itself.

If enough damage were inflicted upon a ''spider rope'' it would disintegrate into a fine, gray powder that lacked [[magic]]al properties.

==Notable Owners==
Most guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more ''spider ropes''.
