        "mainbody": "A '''''cloak of survival''''' was an enchanted item that protected the wearer from poison and disease.",
        "Powers": "While wearing a ''cloak of survival'' the wearer was much less likely to suffer a negative effects from poison and resisted becoming infected by diseases or parasites. Additionally, the [[cloak]] contained a supply of pure air and would envelop the wearer's head if they entered an area where breathing the air would cause harm. The breathable air from the cloak could be used for ten minutes at a time before needing to be replenished. This would even function under water but the cloak would not block the wearer's vision.\n\nThese cloaks also made the wearer completely immune to all normal and magical nausea and ''[[cantrip]]s'' that caused yawning, belching, coughing, and similar actions."
