        "mainbody": "'''Thaolet''' was an [[oil]] made by [[dwarves]] and used for protecting metals from moisture. It was also used to remove rust and tarnish from metal surfaces and blood from weapons.{{Cite dragon/316/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Black Dwarf Mine|75}}",
        "Description": "Thaolet was made by boiling certain plants and then mixing the result with the dust of particular types of stone. This created a black grimy oil that had preservative properties against moisture and oxidation. It was typically used to cleanse and preserve armor. Often a small barrel of thaolet was kept open near a workbench, [[anvil]], or somewhere on a work site to submerge all but the handles of tools when not in use.\n\nThaolet was actually edible, but by all accounts it tasted terrible."
