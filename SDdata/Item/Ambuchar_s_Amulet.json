        "Description": "This large amulet was shaped like a golden skull with a pair of [[diamond]]s for eyes.",
        "Powers": "''Ambuchar's Amulet'' could speak like a sentient creature.\n\nAnyone holding the amulet was magically compelled to place it around their neck. Once placed, the amulet could only be removed by a ''[[remove curse]]'' spell or a ''[[wish]]''. When worn, the amulet would make sarcastic comments at the wearer's expense."
