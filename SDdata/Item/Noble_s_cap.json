        "mainbody": "Nobles caps were minor magic items used by the nobility of large cities such as Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.\nThese hats appeared quite mundane but had minor enchantment weaved into their fabric. Nobles caps subtly affecter the wearers appearance and charisma making them more attractive and persuasive.\nMany believed that nobles caps were created by an unnamed enchanted in a rush. The wizard grabbed a first hat they saw and quickly placed enchantments on them to wiggle out of a tight spot.\nBy the late 14 century DR, nobles caps were in wide use in such cities as Neverwinter of the Sword Coast, and as far south as the city of Samargol in Samarach."
