These were the numbers 1 to 6 in Dethek, the dwarven script.\nIdle dice allowed their owner to provide small amounts of healing to a random ally. The healing potency and target were determined via a literal roll of idle dice. This ability was known as the song of rest.\n*Calliope a bard adventurer owned a pair of idle dice during her time working with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR."
