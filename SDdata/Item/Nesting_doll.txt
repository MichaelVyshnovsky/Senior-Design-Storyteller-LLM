A nesting doll was a type of wooden doll found on both Toril and in Barovia, that were enjoyed by children and adults alike.
Nesting dolls were carved to be completely hollow inside, easily separable into a top and bottom half, and were sold as sets. Each of the dolls within a set would be incrementally smaller than the others, allowing them to be "nested" inside one another. And each of the dolls would be painted to depict something distinct from one another.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold a wide range of finely carved nesting dolls across Faerûn, all at the same price of 2 gold pieces.
