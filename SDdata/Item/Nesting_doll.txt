A '''nesting doll''' was a type of wooden doll found on both [[Toril]] and in [[Barovia]], that were enjoyed by children and adults alike.

==Description==
Nesting dolls were carved to be completely hollow inside, easily separable into a top and bottom half, and were sold as sets. Each of the dolls within a set would be incrementally smaller than the others, allowing them to be "nested" inside one another. And each of the dolls would be painted to depict something distinct from one another.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold a wide range of finely carved nesting dolls across [[Faerûn]], all at the same price of 2 [[gold piece]]s.
;Adventurer's Set: A nesting doll set that together depicted an [[adventuring company]]. The individual dolls within the set depicted a [[bard]], [[cleric]], [[mage]], [[rogue]] and [[warrior]].
;Avatar Set: A nesting doll set that depicted notable personages involved in the [[Avatar Crisis]]. The individual dolls within the set depicted the cleric [[Adon]], the mage [[Elminster]], and the gods [[Cyric]], [[Kalimvor]], and [[Mystra]].
;Famous Wizards: A nesting doll set that depicted famous mages of Faerûn. The individual dolls within the set depicted Elminster, [[Khelben Arunsun]], Lord [[Manshoon]], [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], and a generic [[Red Wizard of Thay]].
;Heroes and Rulers: A nesting doll set that depicted [[Alusair Obarskyr]], King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], [[Mourngrym Amcathra]], [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], and [[The Simbul]].
;Races Set: A nesting doll set that depicted a [[human]] and the four base types of [[demihuman]]s, those being a [[dwarf]], [[elf]], [[gnome]], and [[halfling]].

In the Domain of Barovia, the toysmith [[Gadof Blinsky]] of [[Vallaki]] sold decidedly more macabre nesting dolls within his shop, [[Blinsky Toys]]. One such set depicted a person getting older with each successive doll, until finally the smallest of them depicted a mummified corpse.
