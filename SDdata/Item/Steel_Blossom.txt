The '''''Steel Blossom''''' was a beautiful masterwork [[enchanted]] [[katana]] from [[Kozakura]].

==Powers==
This blade carried a ''+4'' enchantment and emitted bright yellow light at the {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} radius.

==History==
The ''Steel Blossom'' was a masterful creation of a renowned swordsmith [[Anukiru]] of [[Kozakura]]. This blade was commissioned by an unnamed [[Shogun]] to symbolize his rule. However, the weapon makes outdid himself and fell in love with the most beautiful blade he's ever created. Anukiru could not part with the katana he named the ''Steel Blossom''. Maddened by the smith's dishonor, the Shogun beheaded Anukiru with the ''Steel Blossom'' and reclaimed his commission. It was believed that the enchanted katana did not stay with its new master for long as he was killed in battle soon after.

The ''Steel Blossom's'' history remained vague after the fall of the Shogun, and the sword did not resurface again until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The ''Blossom'' was exported out of [[Kozakura]] and was sold at [[Okuzo's Imports]] of [[Westgate]].
