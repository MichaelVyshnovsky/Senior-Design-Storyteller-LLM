A '''''silencing door''''' was a [[Dweomered door]] that, when shut, would cast ''[[silence]]'' upon itself, affecting anyone nearby. These doors were always made to automatically shut when unattended and often had an accompanying pass phrase or key that would temporarily negate it's magical effects.

==Creation==
These doors were crafted using the [[spell]] ''silence''.
