        "Powers": "''Fleshrender'' possessed a strong ''+2'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand toward the target and exacerbated the blade's damage. The weapon's second magic was an enchantment that ''parted the flesh''. It gave the weapon diabolical precision and had a chance of stopping the target from healing or ''[[regenerating]]''.",
        "History": "''Fleshrender's'' original owner called the short sword ''Barney'', but such an innocent name led to ridicule. Eventually, the owner gave in and renamed ''Fleshrender'' under the pressure of mockery, but sulked for a [[tenday]] after. Eventually, the weapon ended up in the hands of the Echo of [[Abazigal]], an apparition of a long-dead [[Bhaalspawn]] who served [[Sarevok Anchev]] in his [[Murder Tribunal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}."
