        "mainbody": "'''''Chir's robes''''' were created and [[enchanted]] by the [[deep gnome]] [[wizard]] [[Chir Darkflame]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Chir's robes'' were dark purple in color and looked more like a quality dress rather than a magician's garb. Upon closer examination, one could see minor alterations and enchantments that Chir weaved into the robes' fabric.",
        "Powers": "The dress possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that prevented anyone but [[gnome]]s who venerated [[evil]] from wearing it. Additionally, the robes allowed the wearer to create magical ''[[darkness]]'' twice per day.",
        "History": "Chir Darkflame enchanted her robes sometime before her capture by the [[illithid]] slavers of the black market in the mountains of [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
