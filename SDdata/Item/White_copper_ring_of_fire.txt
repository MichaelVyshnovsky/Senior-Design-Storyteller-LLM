The white copper ring of fire was a unique magical ring that was forged by the djinn to aid them against the efreet.
This ring was made from white copper.
If worn by any spellcaster, this ring augmented any flame spell cast so that it caused intense white flames to strike any evil creatures or those who drew magic from the Negative Energy plane. The ring accomplished this by drawing its power from the Positive Energy plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire. Additionally, fire-based spells cast by the wearer fully harmed any creature that was normally immune to such attacks.
