Folding saws were a type of saw carried by rangers throughout the wilds of Faer√ªn.
The serrated blade of a folding saw was attached to two pieces of wood via a retaining band.
Folding saws were compact and used just like regular saws or axes for cutting branches or felling trees. They were ineffective if used as a weapon.
Folding saws were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
