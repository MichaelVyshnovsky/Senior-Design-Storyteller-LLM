'''Folding saws''' were a type of [[saw]] carried by [[ranger]]s throughout the wilds of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
The serrated blade of a folding saw was attached to two pieces of wood via a retaining band.

==History==
Folding saws were compact and used just like regular saws or [[axe]]s for cutting branches or felling trees. They were ineffective if used as a weapon.

Folding saws were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
