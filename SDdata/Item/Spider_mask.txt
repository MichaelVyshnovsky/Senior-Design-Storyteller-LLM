A '''spider mask''' was a [[drow]] item that allowed wearers to transverse any web safely.

==Description==
A ''spider mask'' was a black velvet mask with four jointed wire legs protruding from each side of it. It covered the wearer's face completely.

==Powers==
A ''spider mask'' gave a total of three powers to the wearer. First, it gave the wearer [[infravision]] with a range of 90 ft (27 m). Second, it gave the wearer complete immunity against webs of all sort, this included the ''[[web]]'' [[spell]] and the ''[[wand of viscid globs]]''. Third, the ''spider mask'' conferred some protection against [[poison]] from [[vermin]]s like [[spider]]s.

==History==
The ''spider mask'' was a [[magic item]] that was associated with the [[drow]].

==Notable users==
A spider mask was used by both [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]] to cross the magical fence of [[House Baenre]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] that otherwise defeated all other attempts at intrusion. Later Artemis used the same mask to escape a ''web'' spell cast by [[Vendes Baenre]]. It later fell into the possession of [[Gromph Baenre]].
