        "mainbody": "'''''Taragarth''''', nicknamed '''the Bloodbrand''', was a unique magic [[bastard sword]].{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|24}}<ref group=\"note\">The ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'' states on page 126 that ''Taragarth'' was a ''+1 [[short sword]]'' but this is a retcon that belies the blade's history and description. All the other sources used in this article say it was a ''+3'' or ''+0/+3 bastard sword''.",
        "Description": "The blade of ''Taragarth'' appeared as if it had been tarnished by fire, save for along its edges, which gleamed. Just above the crossguard, a rune was etched into the metal of the blade—this was the maker's mark.",
        "Powers": "Even if the blade was sheathed, the bearer of ''Taragarth'' would be protected from extrasensory perception and all detection spells. Once drawn, the bearer would also be protected from flames as if they were wearing a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'' and if they were to fall more than ten feet, they would be affected by a [[feather fall]] spell. The sword had a knack for cutting through foes, allowing a wide swing to affect multiple surrounding opponents.",
        "History": "Legend had it that ''Taragarth'' was forged by [[Elfgar]] of [[Silverymoon]], who gave it to [[Aeroth of Silverymoon]]. Aeroth wielded it against the [[troll]]s of the [[Evermoors]] during the [[Long Battle]] against them and earned it its nickname of ''the Bloodbrand''.\n\nUnfriendly towards Warlord [[Tulven Rayuthson]], when he became ruler of Silverymoon, Aeroth sailed to the [[Moonshae Isles]], but sages hold that ''Taragarth'' was abandoned in a disused well on the isle of [[Toaridge-at-the-Sun's-Setting]] so that his six sons could not bicker over it.\n\n[[Mind flayer]]s discovered the sword at the bottom of said well and took it to the outpost of [[Tellectus]], until it was looted by brave adventurers. The adventurer who claimed it, allegedly a Merchant Guard of [[Amn]], lost it to bandits but a peddler eventually sold it in [[Berdusk]] for a measly four hundred [[gold piece]]s. The purchaser, an adventurer who recognized the blade, was dead less than a day afterward, murdered by his companion, the assassin [[Turl]].\n\nTurl was in debt to his guildmaster, [[Iritan]] of [[Scornubel]], and planned to use the sword to be free of said debt. The next anybody saw of him, Turl was dying in [[Waterdeep]], of poisoned injuries, at the doorstep of the [[necromancer]] [[Marune]]. Turl gave ''Taragarth'', as well as many other treasures, to Marune as payment in an attempt to save his own life.\n\nThe next time ''Taragarth'' was seen was in the hands of [[Vulph]], a warrior from [[Calimshan]], who asked [[Elminster]] to identify the blade when they both found themselves in [[Westgate]]. Once the Sage of Shadowdale was done, Vulph took the blade back and promptly disappeared."
