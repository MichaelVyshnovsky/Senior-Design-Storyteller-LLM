        "mainbody": "A '''''cabinet of air restoration''''' was a [[magic]]al receptacle that created breathable air within the air envelope of a [[spelljammer]].{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}",
        "Description": "These hardwood cabinets were typically 2' (0.6m) tall and 1' (0.3m) wide an had two doors its front side. Behind these doors was a crystal-lined interior. When the cabinet was in use, this crystal would glow a deep green hue.",
        "Powers": "Similar to [[furnace helm]]s, cabinets worked by drawing the magical energy from magical items, draining their charges. Upon uttering the cabinet's [[command word]], 50 cubic yards of breathable air (45.7 cubic m) would be produced. A second command word could be linked to the cabinet to fully restore a spelljammer's air envelope, though this would drain more energy from a given item.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these cabinets were often offered, along with [[spelljamming helm]]s to new purchasers of spelljamming ships."
