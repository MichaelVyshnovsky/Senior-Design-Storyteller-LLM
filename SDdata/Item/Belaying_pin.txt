'''Belaying pins''' were a type of mariner's tool.

==Description==
[[File:Belayingpin-knot.png|thumb|273px|''A diagram of how [[rope]] was typically fastened around a belaying pin.'']]
Belaying pins were short rods of wood or metal that were inserted into holes bored through a ship's rail. The rigging lines of a ship would be fastened to them. They were usually found in rows, bringing a series of [[rope]]s together to one location. Alternatively, sailors would use belaying pins as a place to store their unused ropes.

Beyond their primary purpose, belaying pins could be yanked free and used as an improvised [[club]].{{Cite polyhedron/130/Tying One On|27}} Typically this occurred during boarding actions at sea, when no other weapons were in reach

==Availability==
Belaying pins could be found on practically any ship. They were typically available for purchase at seaside towns or cities, particularly from shipbuilders, warehouses, or businesses that supplied ships.

In the port city [[Athkatla]] for example, the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]] sold belaying pins alongside other nautical equipment.<ref><ref group="note" name="Duty">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item featured in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.
