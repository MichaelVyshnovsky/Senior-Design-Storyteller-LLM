Belaying pins were short rods of wood or metal that were inserted into holes bored through a ships rail. The rigging lines of a ship would be fastened to them. They were usually found in rows, bringing a series of ropes together to one location. Alternatively, sailors would use belaying pins as a place to store their unused ropes.
Beyond their primary purpose, belaying pins could be yanked free and used as an improvised club. Typically this occurred during boarding actions at sea, when no other weapons were in reach
Belaying pins could be found on practically any ship. They were typically available for purchase at seaside towns or cities, particularly from shipbuilders, warehouses, or businesses that supplied ships.
