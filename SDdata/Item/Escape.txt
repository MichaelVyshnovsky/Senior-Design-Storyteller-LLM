| othernames    = ''Vamoose''In the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' and ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'', Brandobaris' favored weapon is referred to as ''Escape'', a dagger. In an earlier source, ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'', avatars of deities wielded their favored weapons. However, in this source, Brandobaris' avatar wields a dagger known as ''Vamoose'', a less common term for escape. ''Vamoose'' functions as a dagger that points to the safest direction of escape. It is also briefly noted that Brandobaris wields another dagger. However, it had no known abilities and was never named in ''Demihuman Deities'' or other sources. As it would be strange for a secondary weapon with unknown abilities to be a favoured weapon of a deity, and because ''Vamoose'' shares a wealth of similarities with ''Escape'', they are assumed to be the same weapon for the purposes of this article.

''Vamoose'' was a dagger with a ''+3'' enchantment that was wielded by the [[avatar]] of Brandobaris. It was able to point out the safest and quickest way of escape, either from a trap or a maze (including the powerful [[maze|spell of the same name]]). If the Trickster was at threat from range, he could turn the dagger into a ''+4 [[sling of seeking]]''. In this form, it was able to sling [[bullet]]s to deal damage, or even dust balls. These balls of dust did not hurt the target, as fired bullets would, but instead could put them into a very deep sleep.
