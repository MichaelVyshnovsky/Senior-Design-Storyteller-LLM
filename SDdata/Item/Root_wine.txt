Root wine was a type of an extremely potent dwarvish wine.
Root Wine was renowned for its strength and palatability to dwarves. Another notable quality of the brew was its spoilage that turned it into poison. Despite becoming harmful and unfit for consumption, spoiled root wine still tasted good. Those who were unwise enough to drink poisonous root wine were rewarded with nausea and wracking pains.
*Dwarven root wine was available during the old glory days of the elven city of Myth Drannor. The Master of the citys School of Wizardry, Azimer was known to consume the beverage.
*On the Sword Coast, root wine was available in Neverwinters Beached Leviathan tavern as of the late 15 century DR.
