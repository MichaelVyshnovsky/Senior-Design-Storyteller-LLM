'''Root wine''' was a type of an extremely potent [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[wine]].

==Description==
Root Wine was renowned for its strength and palatability to dwarves. Another notable quality of the brew was its spoilage that turned it into [[poison]]. Despite becoming harmful and unfit for consumption, spoiled root wine still tasted good. Those who were unwise enough to drink poisonous root wine were rewarded with nausea and wracking pains.

==Availability==
*Dwarven root wine was available during the old glory days of the [[elf|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]]. The Master of the city's [[School of Wizardry]], [[Azimer]] was known to consume the beverage.
*On the [[Sword Coast]], root wine was available in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Beached Leviathan]] tavern as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
