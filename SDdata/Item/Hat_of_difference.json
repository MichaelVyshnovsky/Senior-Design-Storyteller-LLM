        "mainbody": "The '''''hat of difference''''' was a type of [[magical item|magical]] chapeau that allowed its wearer to change their profession in life.",
        "Abilities": "Whoever wore the hat was granted the ability to switch their profession to anything they desired, such as a [[fighter]] becoming a [[cleric]]. They would gain all the associated skills and abilities such a change would entail, but any advances the wearer made were cumulative and would only manifest whilst wearing the hat.\n\nAll experience that the wearer accumulated within the hat would be lost if it was ever discarded, lost, stolen, or not within a {{SI|1|mile}} radius of them for any twenty four hour period.",
        "Notable Hats": "At some point an adventurer wearing one of these hats traversed the caverns of [[Deepearth]] and met his end at the hands of a [[neo-otyugh]].<ref>\n\n[[Howard Holiday]] owned such a hat, a broad-brimmed garment with a [[hippogriff]] feather."
