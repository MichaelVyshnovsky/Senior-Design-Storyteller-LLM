        "mainbody": "The hat of difference was a type of magical chapeau that allowed its wearer to change their profession in life.\nWhoever wore the hat was granted the ability to switch their profession to anything they desired, such as a fighter becoming a cleric. They would gain all the associated skills and abilities such a change would entail, but any advances the wearer made were cumulative and would only manifest whilst wearing the hat.\nAll experience that the wearer accumulated within the hat would be lost if it was ever discarded, lost, stolen, or not within a  radius of them for any twenty four hour period.\nAt some point an adventurer wearing one of these hats traversed the caverns of Deepearth and met his end at the hands of a neo-otyugh.\nHoward Holiday owned such a hat, a broad-brimmed garment with a hippogriff feather."
