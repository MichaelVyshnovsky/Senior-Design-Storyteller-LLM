        "mainbody": "irdles of Priestly Might were magical items that could be found in Halruaa.\nThese items only appeared after the Time of Troubles. Halruaans believed this to be a clear sign that their goddess Mystra had finally regained her powers. The existence of these items was one of the reasons that the worship of Azuth did not gain more support from Halruaa.\nEach girdle was marked with a symbol of good or evil that was bonded to its front. Someone attempting to wear a girdle that opposed the true nature of their heart was cursed, effectively blocking that priest from receiving all but the most basic spells from their god or goddess until an atonement spell was cast upon them.\nThree versions of this magical item existed\n*Girdle of Priestly Might\n*Girdle of Priestly Warding\n*Girdle of Holy Might\nThis item imbued the wearer with the physical strength of a fierce warrior and helped protect them against attacks.\nIn addition to the powers granted by the Girdle of Priestly Might, this girdle protected the wearer against evil or good.\nThis girdle granted the powers of the previous two girdles while also granting the wearer the ability to use the word of recall spell once per month.\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryBelts\nCategoryItems from Halruaa\nCategoryItems from the Shining South\nCategoryItems from South Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\ngtib0o9yqmes6aick3eluhunei3uvzq"
