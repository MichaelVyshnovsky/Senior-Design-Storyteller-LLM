        "History": "''Selûne's Eye'' was a matter of legend, set down in the [[Song of Selûne]]. It began when the wayward young goddess [[Selûne]] traveled to another [[plane]] and was smitten by a mysterious and attractive warrior, a lord of his people. The stranger persuaded her to use her father's [[wand of power]] to transport him and his followers to [[Toril]], where they planned to settle. However, once they landed, he revealed his true form and intentions—he was the monstrous [[Imgig Zu]] and he and his people were intent on conquest and ruin. He seized her father's wand of power and intended to kill the deceived goddess.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}} \n\nFortunately, a brave young [[wizard]] named [[Ostus Agrivar]] who was riding by raced to her rescue. Although the wizard was not powerful enough to defeat the monsters, he was capable of causing enough confusion and chaos that Selûne could escape. The goddess, now freed from her subjugation, used the only thing she had left: her own life force. Draining her life force away, she imprisoned the monsters inside a pocket dimension within a gigantic [[moonstone]], which should contain them for all time. She reduced the gem, now known as ''Selûne's Eye'', in size and gave it to Ostus for safe keeping. Ostus Agrivar felt he had a holy trust as keeper and guardian of ''Selûne's Eye''.\n\nHowever, from inside the gem, Imgig Zu somehow managed to observe a shamanic rite in which the [[elves]] of [[Shadowdale]] extracted a dark spirit from the infant [[Cybriana]], daughter of Ostus Agrivar. Imgig watched as the dark spirit transformed itself into a living being, an evil [[drow]] woman who took the name \"[[Kilili]]\". Imgig forged a magical link with Kilili, which allowed him to escape into the Realms. However, he needed Cybriana and Kilili together to release the rest of his people from ''Selûne's Eye''. Kilili fell in with Imgig, and together they hatched their scheme.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon}} \n\n[[File:Ostus-Agrivar.jpg|thumb|left|Ostus wearing the ''Eye'' around his neck.]]In the [[1352 DR|Year of the Dragon, 1352 DR]], Imgig Zu broke through the wall of [[Ostus's Hold]] and attacked Ostus Agrivar and his son [[Priam Agrivar|Priam]]. Imgig Zu crippled Priam with the ''[[staff of withering]]'' and slew Ostus with a death [[spell]]. Imgig Zu seized the ''Selûne's Eye'' and left.\n\nHowever, some six years later, Imgig Zu was yet unable to use the ''Eye''. In one day in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Imgig Zu erected a magical tower a day's ride north of [[Waterdeep]], and had his [[yuan-ti]] and [[chasme]] minions find and kidnap female elven [[magic-user]]s as he sought out Cybriana. Imgig Zu had determined that it was Kilili's own \"sister\", Cybriana, whose very presence could make ''Selûne's Eye'' glow like the moon.\n\nImgig later used magic to contact his kin, who longed for release from ''Selûne's Eye''. Imgig promised that he was close to succeeding and that he would soon release them to overrun Toril, an event he called the Great Awakening.{{Cite comic/The Bounty Seekers Of Manshaka|4}} \n\nLater, after the hunting chasme had been destroyed by Cybriana and her companions, Imgig Zu observed ''Selûne's Eye'' glow like the moon, meaning that Kilili's sister was near his tower and had been found by the chasme. Kilili visited Cybriana, and lured her toward Imgig's tower. Imgig's gargoyles snatched up Cybriana, and she was taken into their lair. Her companions, Priam Agrivar, [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], [[Timoth Eyesbright]], and [[Onyx the Invincible]] escaped the gargoyles and found other ways in. In the caverns beneath Imgig's tower, Cybriana was placed inside a ''[[forcecage]]'' as Kilili stood just outside. Their proximity, both to each other and to ''Selûne's Eye'' caused the gem to glow even more brightly and to swell in size. Proclaiming his triumphs before an audience of his [[ogre]] minions, Imgig Zu used the combined powers of the elven women and the stolen wand of power to open the ''Eye'' and released his long-imprisoned people into the world, to overrun and conquer the Realms. Meanwhile, Cybriana's companions battled through the ogres and into the cavern, but were ultimately subdued. But, just then, the roof of the cavern tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon—the workings of the goddess Selûne—shone through, blinding the ogres, and Priam slew Imgig Zu.\n\n[[File:Kyriani descends.jpg|thumb|right|Kyriani descends and gives ''Selûne's Eye'' to Priam.]]At Imgig's death, the ''forcecage'' faded, and Cybriana escaped. She grabbed Kilili, knowing that if they touched then they would merge, becoming one whole being, part good and part evil, and the living key to ''Selûne's Eye''. The Cybriana-half gained dominance over the Kilili-half, and the merged being vanished inside the gem, drawing all of Imgig's people back within, saving the Realms from devastation at the cost of her unique identity. A merged being, [[Kyriani]], levitated down, bearing the shrunken ''Selûne's Eye'', which she passed to Priam Agrivar, her brother and son of Ostus.\n\nReturning to the [[Selûne's Smile]] inn, Priam gave ''Selûne's Eye'' to [[Luna]], the innkeeper, for safekeeping, on Vajra's recommendation. She placed it on the shelf over the bar.\n\n'''After the Time of Troubles'''\n\nAfter Luna was slain in a battle with Shar's avatar in [[1358 DR]], [[Selûne's Smile]] was inherited by Kyriani but ''Selûne's Eye'' was forgotten for decades. However, after the return of the [[shade]]s in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], Kyriani received a vision from Selûne which urged her to seek out a band of adventurers to quest for the Moonmaiden. The vision instructed her to give them the artifact and take it to \"[[Elah'zad]], the House of the Moon\" and \"perform the Ritual of the Waxing from the center of the alabaster palace there.\" \n\nWith research it would have been discovered that Elah'zad lay in the [[Hills of Scent]] in the heart of [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]], near the [[City of Shade]]. If the Ritual of the Waxing had been performed by a follower of Selûne on the night following the new moon, its portal-making abilities, normally used to open or close the pocket dimension contained within, would have opened a temporary portal to the [[Gates of the Moon]]...and the city of [[Selûnarra]] would have returned to [[Toril]], there to do battle with the shades of [[Thultanthar]]. Why this event never occurred remains a mystery, other than a suitable adventuring company not being found or the proper research not being carried out.",
