'''''Batiri bucklers''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Batiri]] [[shield]]s created by the crafters and [[shaman]]s of the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Description==
These shields were created from affixed together, overlapping shells of giant [[beetle]]s found in the jungles of [[Chult]]. Like similar items made of metal, ''Batiri bucklers'' were sturdy and lightweight. The bucklers' surface was decorated with Batiri warpaints.

==Powers==
''Batiri bucklers'' were so light, they offered little detriment to spellcasters. These shields were enchanted with ''+1'' enchantments. However, their organic nature made them vulnerable to both mundane and magical fire.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, goblins of the [[Shattered Spear tribe]] in [[Samarach]] used these enchanted beetle carapace bucklers.
