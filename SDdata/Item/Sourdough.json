        "mainbody": "Sourdough was a type of bread from the Pirate Isles,\nSourdough was made by setting aside part of a previous batch of dough to leaven the next batch. The resulting bread had a heavy consistency and a hard crust.\nA loaf of sourdough could also be hollowed out and used as a bowl in feasts.\nSourdough bread originated in the Pirate Isles but rapidly gained popularity in the Sword Coast and the Western Heartlands in the 15 century DR."
