        "mainbody": "\"The Prophet\" was a painting found in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR. It was considered \"newer\" by 1479 DR.\nIt was a portrait of a female elf garbed in black with a purple sash, with a mechanical owl perched on her arm. The title \"The Prophet\" was etched into the frame. The subject did not appear particularly prescient.\n\"The Prophet\" was found in the Merchant Guild Hall in the Neverwinter/River District of Neverwinter in the , presumably having been left behind by the guild merchants or looted by the Many-Arrows orcs who occupied the district and turned the hall into a fortress. Although the orcs burned, smashed, or defiled all the artworks within, \"The Prophet\" survived curiously intact and left propped against some crates."
