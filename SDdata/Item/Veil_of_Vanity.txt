The Veil of Vanity was an ancient enchanted ring of elven make looted from the ruins of Myth Drannor.
The Veil of Vanity ring was decorated with an intricate etched floral design.
This ring granted the wearer enchanted charisma at the cost of reduced wisdom and slightly reduced intelligence.
In 1369 DR, the Veil of Vanity found its way into the claws of lizardfolk, one of the groups of humanoids that fought over the dominance of the ruins of the City of Song. The lizardman wearing the ring could be found on the Halls of Stone level of the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor.
