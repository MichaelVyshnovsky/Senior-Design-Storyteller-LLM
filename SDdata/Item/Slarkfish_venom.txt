Slarkfish venom was a poison extracted from the fangs or spines of slarkfish. It was harvested by pirates from the Nelanther Isles and sold to merchants in Skullport and Waterdeep.
This substance was a cloudy, white liquid with a faintly sweet taste. It could be mixed with water or alcohol and still retain its potency. A single dose typically cost 100 gp.
This poison was typically used to incapacitate victims because, when ingested, it caused clumsiness and reduced coordination, eventually leading to unconsciousness, unless the victim was hardy enough to resist these effects.
Elsk Thavarask, the proprietor of the Missing Minotaur tavern in Everlund, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, used slarkfish poison to subdue overly rowdy customers. He was also known to sell it to people he trusted.
