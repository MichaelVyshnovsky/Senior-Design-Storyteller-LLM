        "mainbody": "self-dousing lantern was a type of lantern that extinguished itself after a certain time or if tipped over.\nThe simplest type of self-dousing lantern consisted of a candle held by metal pincers inside a container partially filled with water. As the candle burned, the water prevented drips. In case the candle burned too low or the lantern was tipped over, the water also extinguished the flame, preventing any potential accidents.\nSelf-dousing lanterns were very popular among innkeepers. They were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, which also recommended them to sages, nobles, priests and wizards who had the habit of late-night study and were prone to dozing off."
