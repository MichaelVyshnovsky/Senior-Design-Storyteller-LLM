Potions of dragonbreath were magical concoctions that could simulate the infamous and dangerous fiery breath of a dragon. In the post-Spellplague era these potions came in a wider variety, simulating the range of breaths characteristic of chromatic dragons.
These small red potions were hot and fiery in appearance and taste.
When consumed, the magics of these potions allowed the drinker to produce a huge gout of hot burning flames out of their mouth. The flames were similar to those of an actual dragon and similar to the effects of the dragons breath spell.
In the post-Spellplague era, in addition to huge gouts of hot burning flames an imbiber could breath a gout of searing acid, freezing cold, poisonous gas, or streaks of lightning. 
Circa 1372 DR, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh, who feuded with a lizardman shaman Uzzak-Szalzik, possessed a rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews. Among them were potions of dragonbreath of her own creation. These potions were available to any of the green hags allies against her sworn lizardfolk enemy.
