Bouqthi was a type of pastry made in Luiren.
This delicious pastry was made by stuffing sugared dough with red rhubarb stalks harvested from the southern edge of the Long Forest. There were easily a hundred different variations of the basic recipe, with all being a delicious treat in their own right.
Despite its popularity, bouqthi was rarely exported since pastries did not fare well under the rigors of travelling over long distances.
