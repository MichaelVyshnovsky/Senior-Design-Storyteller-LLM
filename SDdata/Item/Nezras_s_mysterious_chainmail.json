        "mainbody": "'''''Nezras's mysterious chainmail''''' was an enchanted set of [[chainmail]] armor that once belonged to the infamous [[Nezras]] the Traitor.",
        "Description": "''Nezras's mysterious chainmail'' was an oddly shapeless chainmail.",
        "Powers": "Apart from the ''+5'' enchantments to armor and defense, ''Nezras's mysterious chainmail'' possessed the ability to cast the spell ''[[blink]]''. The ''mysterious chainmail'' also affected the wearer in a negative way: it reduced the wearer's wisdom, will defenses, and reflexes.",
        "History": "Even though the traitor Nezras survived the end of the [[Weeping War]] in [[714 DR]], and eventually achieved [[lich]]dom in [[1014 DR]], his ''mysterious chainmail'' was left behind in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. By [[1369 DR]], ''Nezras's mysterious chainmail'' came to be possessed by a [[dark naga]] named [[Sleethur]], who laired in the depths of the [[Elven Catacombs]]. The naga used bluff, magic, and the ''mysterious chainmail'' to lure unwitting victims into a trap just to bombard them with ''[[fireball]]''s."
