The mysterious chainmail also affected the wearer in a negative way it reduced the wearers wisdom, will defenses, and reflexes.\nEven though the traitor Nezras survived the end of the Weeping War in 714 DR, and eventually achieved lichdom in 1014 DR, his mysterious chainmail was left behind in the ruins of Myth Drannor. By 1369 DR, Nezrass mysterious chainmail came to be possessed by a dark naga named Sleethur, who laired in the depths of the Elven Catacombs. The naga used bluff, magic, and the mysterious chainmail to lure unwitting victims into a trap just to bombard them with fireballs."
