        "Description": "This spear had an intricately etched shaft of slim [[silver]].",
        "Powers": "When struck on the ground three times by a servant of the [[Grand Caliph]] this spear would summon several hundred [[faris]] to serve the wielder. The summoned farisan did not appear magically, rather they had to arrive by conventional means. These individuals were the descendants of the [[Wandering Legion]] and would only serve the wielder if they upheld the [[Law of the Loregiver]].",
