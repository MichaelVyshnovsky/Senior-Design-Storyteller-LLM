        "mainbody": "'''Elfsong Cider''' was a distinctly average [[cider]] named after the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] and served for the first time during the 14{{th}} century DR by [[Alyth Elendara|\"Lady\" Alyth Elendara]].",
        "Description": "This cider was notably fruity and flat. That was the only notable thing about the beverage's flavor. The cider was sold across the Sword Coast just on its name and the Tavern of its origin's reputation. The Elfsong Tavern was made famous by the strange haunting ghostly female voice heard there on occasion and a stuffed baby [[beholder]] doll that hung over the bar."
