        "mainbody": "lfsong Cider was a distinctly average cider named after the Elfsong Tavern in Baldurs Gate and served for the first time during the 14 century DR by \"Lady\" Alyth Elendara.\nThis cider was notably fruity and flat. That was the only notable thing about the beverages flavor. The cider was sold across the Sword Coast just on its name and the Tavern of its origins reputation. The Elfsong Tavern was made famous by the strange haunting ghostly female voice heard there on occasion and a stuffed baby beholder doll that hung over the bar."
