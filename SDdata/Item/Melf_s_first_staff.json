        "mainbody": "'''''Melf's first staff''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[staff]] that once was wielded by [[mage]] [[Melf]] of [[Oerth]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The weapon was a light an flexible weapon carved with [[mithral]] sigils of [[elf|elven]] crafting.",
        "Powers": "''Melf's first staff'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that strengthened the [[weapon]]'s blows and aided the wielder's aim. It also strengthened the wielder's offensive magics and made their effects harder to dodge or shake off. Additionally, the wielder could cast ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]'' once per day.",
        "History": "The staff was presumed to come from the world of Oerth and wielded by Melf during his time leading the order of the [[Knights of Luna]]. Some speculated that not just despite his amusing name but because of it, Melf was a talented wizard and an innovator. By some unknown means, ''Melf's first staff'' ended up on [[Toril]] sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, where it fell into the hands of [[Blurg]], an [[orog]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]] during his studies at a friendly [[myconid]] colony near the [[Ebonlake Grotto]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]' [[Underdark]]."
