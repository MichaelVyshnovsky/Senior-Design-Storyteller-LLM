A scrying eye was a magic device that allowed someone to view an area far away from their present location.
A scrying eye resembled a glassy lidless eye that floated some height above the ground.
Some scrying eyes were crafted with truesight, allowing them to see through illusions and into the ethereal plane.
Anyone gazing into, and being viewed by, the eye could reach out to feel a connection with whomever or whatever was on its "other side". Tapping into that connection may see their own image reflected in the eye, falling into itself into eternity.
Circa the , cultists of the Absolute from Moonrise Towers used scrying eyes to keep appraised of their subordinates in the Shattered Sanctum and Grymforge.
Some archfey were known to utilize scrying eyes.
