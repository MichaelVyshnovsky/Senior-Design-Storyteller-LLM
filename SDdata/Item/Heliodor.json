        "mainbody": "eliodor was a variety of golden beryl and considered a precious stone for jewelry and ornamentation. It has some magical uses as well.\nHeliodor had a deep yellow hue with tints from greenish yellow to reddish yellow and yielded medium to large facet-cut gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp.\nHeliodor gems could be substituted for other naturally-occurring material components (i.e., those that did not require manufacturing or special construction) in all priest spells of the sun sphere. Crushed heliodor was a required reagent when forging a sun blade."
