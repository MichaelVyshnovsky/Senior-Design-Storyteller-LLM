        "mainbody": "A '''''kishkoman''''', or '''whistle-knife''' was a unique weapon found in the [[Cold Lands]].{{cite book/The Fall of Highwatch/MMP|15-16}}",
        "Description": "A ''kishkoman'' looked like a small animal horn only slightly longer than a child's hand. The broader base of the horn served as the handle and was perforated with small holes. When blown, the ''kishkoman'' emitted a high-pitched sound that only [[elf|elves]] could hear. This sound was used to call for aid to any within hearing range of the whistle.",
        "History": "These items were made from the horn of a small [[swiftstag]] buck. Mothers typically gave them to children when they reached an age where they could go off on their own."
