An amulet of the planes was a magic amulet that allowed its wearer to travel between the planes.
Amulets of the planes were typically circular necklace pendants, fashioned from gray metal and black stone and inscribed with various symbols. On closer inspection, they resembled a swirling mass of dark color, and gave off a strong conjuration aura.
A skilled wearer could use an amulet to cast plane shift, transporting themselves and nearby creatures to a familiar location on another plane of existence. However, reckless or unfortunate use could send the wearer and their surroundings astray, even to entirely different planes altogether.
* When used inside the legendary hut of Baba Yaga, an amulet of the planes would only transport its wearer and nearby creatures to somewhere else within the hut.
* Prior to the Spellplague, this amulet would not function while in the Demiplane of Dread.
* Iggwilv, the archfey patron of Prismeer in the Feywild.
