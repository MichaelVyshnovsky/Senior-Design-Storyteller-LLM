'''Tourmaline''' was a long-crystalled mineral that came in many colors and was considered a [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]].

==Description==
Tourmaline could be found in a wide variety of colors, the more common being pale shades of blue, brown, gold, green, pink, red, and silver pearl. And a red or pink tourmaline was called a [[rubellite]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|48}}

Tourmalines were considered sacred by followers of [[Deneir]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The rainbow variety of tourmaline was sacred to followers of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11, 13}}

These stones were mined in the [[Ten Towns]] region in [[northwest Faerûn]] near the town of [[Termalaine]].

==Powers==
All tourmalines could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' that blasted outward in straight lines from the crystal facets in directions chosen by the caster. This act consumed the gem in the process.

==Reputation==
Tourmaline was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they used only those of blue and red color.
