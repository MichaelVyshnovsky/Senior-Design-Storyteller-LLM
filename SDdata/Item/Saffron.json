        "Availability": "Places in the Realms where one could find saffron being produced or sold included:\n* The only place in [[Faer没n]] where the crocus flower grew in abundance was [[Ormpur Bay]] in [[southwest Faer没n]]. From this flower, saffron was produced in [[Ormpur]], which was named the \"City of Saffron\" for good reason.\n* In [[interior Faer没n]], saffron was commonly available in the republic of [[Turmish]] due to imports and trade.<ref>{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-10/Turmishan spices}}\n* In [[Kara-Tur]], saffron was one of the main spices traded through the town of [[Pursai]] in [[Malatra]].\n* Saffron was also known and used in the continent of [[Zakhara]].<ref><ref>\n* In [[Ravens Bluff]], where Lord [[Huehm Gultossan]] of the [[Gultoss]] family made his fortune trading saffron and other valuable spices.",
        "Usage": "Saffron was used as both a spice and a [[spell component]]. It was also one of the components in a specialized Zakharan ritual used to ''[[summon]]'' air spirits called [[sakina]].<ref>\n\nSaffron was said to be useful in treating [[measles]].",
        "Price": "Saffron was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. As a spell component, 4 ounces (113 grams) of ground saffron was sold for 4 [[gold piece]]s. As a spice, 1 ounce (28 grams) of whole saffron was sold for 45 gold pieces, making it the most expensive on offer. In general, 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) of saffron as a trade good might go for 15 gold pieces.",
        "History": "In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the dowry of Chansreena (princess) [[Alabhansree Alanasker]] of Ormpur included a large quantity of saffron, as well as many magical blades. This dowry disappeared when she did."
