From this flower, saffron was produced in Ormpur, which was named the \"City of Saffron\" for good reason.\n* In interior Faerûn, saffron was commonly available in the republic of Turmish due to imports and trade.\n* In Kara-Tur, saffron was one of the main spices traded through the town of Pursai in Malatra.\n* Saffron was also known and used in the continent of Zakhara.\n* In Ravens Bluff, where Lord Huehm Gultossan of the Gultoss family made his fortune trading saffron and other valuable spices.\nSaffron was used as both a spice and a spell component. It was also one of the components in a specialized Zakharan ritual used to summon air spirits called sakina.\nSaffron was said to be useful in treating measles.\nSaffron was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. As a spell component, 4 ounces (113 grams) of ground saffron was sold for 4 gold pieces. As a spice, 1 ounce (28 grams) of whole saffron was sold for 45 gold pieces, making it the most expensive on offer. In general, 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) of saffron as a trade good might go for 15 gold pieces.\nIn the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, the dowry of Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur included a large quantity of saffron, as well as many magical blades.
