        "mainbody": "Berduskan Dark was a wine exported from Berdusk and sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nThis heavy wine was dark and sweet with a slight burning aftertaste. Possessed of a high alcohol content, this wine was eagerly sought throughout the Realms.\nAt one point this wine was bottled thanks to cooperation between guilds in Berdusk. However, a falling out between the Vinters and Alchemists guilds ended the bottling process.\nDry Berduskan was said to pair well with a dish of Tharsultan prawns cooked with plovers eggs in garlic butter.\nBerduskan Dark wine was served at Feldeposts Inn of Beregost, priced at five gold coins per serving.\nBerduskan Dark could be purchased in the following containers\n* Hand keg (14 gp)\n* Cask (24 sp)\n* Barrel (60 gp)\n* Bottle (if available, 12 gp)\nBy the late 15 century DR, a bottle of Berduskan Dark wine, 1385 DR vintage, was valued at 1,500 gp."
