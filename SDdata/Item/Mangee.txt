'''Mangee''' was a board game played with a set of ten [[enchanted]] [[jade]] figurines that originated from the land of [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Mangee used a ten-sided board to play the game and needed a full set of twenty-five pieces. Each game piece was an expertly carved jade figurine of a creature, and each was enchanted with [[alteration]], [[enchantment]], and [[conjuration]] magics and was valued at 500 [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]]. The figurines' magic could only be used if all the pieces were assembled together, and no [[divination]] sorcery could reveal the magic before the set was completed.

Some of the jade figurines were: a [[dragon]], a [[lion]], an [[eagle]], a [[monkey]], and a [[bear]].

==History==
The origins of Mangee were obscure but traceable to the Empire of Shou Lung in Kara-Tur, long before the 14{{th}} century DR. An incomplete set of figurines was recovered in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR by a band of heroes of the Living City. The Mangee statuettes were hidden in a cave in the mountains on [[the Vast]] inhabited by deadly creatures like [[chimera]]e and [[manticore]]s.
