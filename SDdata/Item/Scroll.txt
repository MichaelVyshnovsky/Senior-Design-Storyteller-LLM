A scroll is a rolled or folded document.  Unlike a tome, a scroll is usually a single piece of parchment.  Magical scrolls contain the words of a spell that is released when the caster reads the words on the page.  Magical scrolls may be scribed by wizards, clerics, or druids. 
Scrolls of the appropriate magic may be read by the classes that can scribe scrolls.  In addition, rogues can read magic well enough to activate a scroll and occasionally other classes may have the ability to use scrolls although this may be risky for non magic-users.
