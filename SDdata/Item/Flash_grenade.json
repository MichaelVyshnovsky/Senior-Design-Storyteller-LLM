        "mainbody": "'''Flash grenades''' were a type of non-lethal explosive developed by [[deep gnome]]s that disoriented and blinded foes.",
        "Description": "These explosives were about the size of a [[chicken]] [[egg]] and were fragile.",
        "Powers": "In order to be set off, a flash grenade had to thrown onto a fire source. Once set off, these grenades exploded out into a brilliant flare of light. creatures with eyes sensitive to strong lights, such as the [[drow]] and many denizens of the [[Underdark]], were especially affected by this flash."
