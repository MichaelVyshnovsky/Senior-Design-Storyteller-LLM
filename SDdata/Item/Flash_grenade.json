        "mainbody": "Flash grenades were a type of non-lethal explosive developed by deep gnomes that disoriented and blinded foes.\nThese explosives were about the size of a chicken egg and were fragile.\nIn order to be set off, a flash grenade had to thrown onto a fire source. Once set off, these grenades exploded out into a brilliant flare of light. creatures with eyes sensitive to strong lights, such as the drow and many denizens of the Underdark, were especially affected by this flash."
