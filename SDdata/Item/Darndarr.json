        "mainbody": "Darndarr was a type of ale that was renowned for its nutty taste and ease of storage and transportation. Darndarr was popular all throughout the Sword Coast the late 15 century DR for both casual consumption and use in marinades.\nDarndarrs taste was often described as nutty, or \"sandy\". Its flavor was easily paired with commons foods such as seared meats and fish.\nDarndarr was popular among merchants and traders for its ease of transportation, as it kept well, even out in the sun.\nTraditionally, darndarr was served in small earthenware jugs. The jugs themselves were often used in pranks as they easily broke down into powder upon impact. These prank projectiles were referred to as \"drench people\" missiles.\nMany people of the Sword Coast had kegs or jars of darndarr in their homes for cooking, drinking, or even to keep perishable foods in. This preservation tradition was referred to as \"jugging\" something."
