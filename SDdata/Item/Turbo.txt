Turbo shells, also known as green snails, were valuable seashells that were used for adornment.
Giant rare specimens that had been polished to a pearly sheen were prized for their own sake, while smaller common ones were cut and polished for their mother of pearl. Those that had a certain "fire luster" provided nacre instead.
