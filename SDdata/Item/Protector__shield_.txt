Protectors were small enchanted military hin shields from Luiren.
These shields were proudly decorated with the markings of Luiren, indicating their military purpose.
Protectors were functionally buckler for anyone bigger than a halfling. They possessed a +2 enchantment and had an ability to soak part of the damage dealt to it.
Protectors originated from the strongheart halflings of Luiren. These shields were standard equipment of Luirens well-organized militia and blessed by the leaders of said militia, halfling clergy.
Generally, these shields never left Luiren unless taken off a fallen soldiers body. Most protectors that could be found along the Sword Coast in the late 14 century DR were likely looted or stolen from the hardy strongheart halfling.
