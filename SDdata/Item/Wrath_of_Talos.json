        "Powers": "The ''Wrath'' possessed a ''+4'' enchantment and granted the wielder immunity to electricity. This [[shortbow]] materialized its own [[arrow]]s made out of ''[[Lightning arrow|lightning]]''. Additionally, it granted the wielder ''[[darkvision]]''.",
        "History": "Talossan worshipers believed this bow to be manifestation of their god's wraith, showering their targets with unending ''lightning bolts''. It was believed that some of the most devoted worshipers of [[Talos]] wandered into raging storms and shot this weapon's lighting upon people scattering for shelter.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], the ''Wrath of Talos'' was in possession of the [[Zhentarim]] squad stationed in [[Iyrauroth]]'s swamps of [[Thar]]."
