Melon pie was a rarely-liked type of pie pastry stuffed with melon, predominately found in Amn and the city of Westgate.
As of the late 14 century DR, melon pie was a rare sight indeed. It was served at the Harfin Draether eatery and tavern of Athkatlas Temple District, where the "treat" could be seen sitting rotting away, plastered with flies. Despite its "appetizing" appearance, this pie was often purchased not for its taste but rather because it was served alongside a plateful of universally beloved sugar-cookies. Despite most folks apparent aversion to the dish, it still had its fans, notably Ruldan of Westgate, a man famed for his proclivities, love for melon pies, and sculpting the Lady Rapturous, dedicated to Sune â€“ the goddess of love.
