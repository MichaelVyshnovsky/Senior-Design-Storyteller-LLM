'''Melon pie''' was a rarely-liked type of pie pastry stuffed with [[melon]], predominately found in [[Amn]] and the city of [[Westgate]].

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], melon pie was a rare sight indeed. It was served at the [[Harfin Draether]] eatery and tavern of [[Athkatla]]'s [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]], where the "treat" could be seen sitting rotting away, plastered with [[fly (insect)|flies]]. Despite its "appetizing" appearance, this pie was often purchased not for its taste but rather because it was served alongside a plateful of universally beloved [[sugar-cookie]]s. Despite most folk's apparent aversion to the dish, it still had its fans, notably [[Ruldan]] of Westgate, a man famed for his proclivities, love for melon pies, and sculpting the ''[[Lady Rapturous]]'', dedicated to [[Sune]] – the goddess of love.
