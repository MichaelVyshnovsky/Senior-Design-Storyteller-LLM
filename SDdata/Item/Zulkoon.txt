A '''zulkoon''' was a wind musical instrument that functioned like a portable pump organ.

==Description==
A zulkoon player pumped air into the instrument and through its organ pipes using a foot pump. This produced a droning sound over other notes due to the constant flow of air through the instrument and conferred it a sinister and dramatic sound.

Zulkoons were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==History==
Zulkoons were created by the [[zulkir]]s of [[Thay]] and were used originally to aid in the casting of spells.
