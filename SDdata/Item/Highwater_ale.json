        "Description": "Highwater ale was a clear liquid with a very distinct [[mint]]y flavor that was considered to be an acquired taste",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Highwater ale was rarely found outside Highcastle, even though by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Highwater ale's popularity reached the [[Sword Coast]] and the ale could be purchased at the inns of [[Daggerford]], such as [[Happy Cow]] and [[Black Stone Inn]], as well as [[Liam's Hold]]'s own [[Holdfast Inn]].",
        "Rumors and Legends": "If asked, Highcastle locals eagerly shared their belief that Highwater ale's peculiar flavor came from the bones of monsters that lived deep inside the town's well that was used to brew this libation."
