{{otheruses4|the magic shield|other uses|Nightshade (disambiguation)}}
The '''''Nightshade''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[shield]] that dated back to [[Myth Drannor]]'s glory days.

==Description==
The ''Nightshade'' was a small and round shield, patterned with stars.

==Powers==
The enchantments woven into the shield increased the wielder's defense and reflexes at the cost of their constitution. Additionally, the ''Nightshade'' allowed its owner to cast the ''[[improved invisibility]]'' spell at will. This ability had only three charges.

==History==
Even though the shield dated back to the times before the [[Weeping War]] and the fall of Myth Drannor, the ''Nightshade'' ended up on the bottom of one of the many magical waters reservoirs of the [[Elven Catacombs]]. The shield was still there in [[1369 DR]], but the pool was inhabited by a swarm of flesh-eating [[fish]]. Anyone who was able to pacify or kill the animals could retrieve this enchanted item.
