        "mainbody": "A Libram of Ineffable Damnation was a tome of great value to arcane spellcasters who venerated evil.\nTo make use of the work, an evil wizard needed to spend a week cloistered and undisturbed, perusing the tome. Before , the book would teach them approximately half of what they needed to take their skills to the next level after , these books instead increased the natural qualities of the magician that governed their spellcasting. In either case, the book disappeared after use, and no mage could gain the benefit of such a tome again.\nArcane casters whose alignment was rejected by the book suffered severe damage, were left unconscious for 50-200 minutes, commensurate to the damage taken, and needed an atonement spell cast in order to continue their studies before . Anyone not an arcane spellcaster in the first place who read the tome was at risk of insanity.\n* Munafik, high priest of Amun-Re, and Master of Tomes of Terbakar, was interred with a libram of ineffable damnation.\n* Tiamat had one of these librams among the treasure horde in her lair in the Abyss."
