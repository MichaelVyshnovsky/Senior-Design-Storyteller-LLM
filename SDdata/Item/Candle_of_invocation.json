        "mainbody": "'''''Candles of invocation''''' were powerful [[magic item|magical]] [[candle]]s that bolstered the abilities of creatures in its proximity that matched the philosophical [[alignment]] of the [[deity]] to which they were consecrated. They also conferred additional powers to [[divine magic|divine spellcaster]]s and could even be used to summon creatures.",
        "Description": "A typical ''candle of invocation'' seemed identical to a red taper.",
        "Powers": "Nine types of ''candles of invocation'' existed, During its construction, the candle was dedicated to a certain deity. Once lit, the candle could burn for up to 4 hours, shedding a faint light over a radius of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. All creatures inside that radius whose alignment matched that of the deity to which the candle was dedicated at the time of its construction enjoyed a boost to their innate abilities and resistances.\n\nMoreover, divine spellcasters such as [[druid]]s and [[cleric]]s had their abilities considerably augmented by the candle. Post-[[Second Sundering]] versions allowed the casters to cast their most basic [[spell]]s without limit, while pre-[[Spellplague]] versions improved their connection to their deities, to the point of even granting them access to spells that would normally be beyond their nominal skill levels.\n\nAnother possible use for a ''candle of invocation'' was to use it to cast the ''[[gate]]'' spell to summon a creature whose alignment matched the candle's dedicated deity. This power could only be used the first time the candle was lit, after which the candle was destroyed.",
        "Notable ''Candles of Invocation''": "A ''candle of invocation'' dedicated to the [[neutral evil]] deity [[Sseth]] was located in a [[yuan-ti]] temple within the [[Slitherswamp]] level of [[Undermountain]]."
