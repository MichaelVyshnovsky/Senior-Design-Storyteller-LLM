They also conferred additional powers to divine spellcasters and could even be used to summon creatures.\nA typical candle of invocation seemed identical to a red taper.\nNine types of candles of invocation existed, During its construction, the candle was dedicated to a certain deity. Once lit, the candle could burn for up to 4 hours, shedding a faint light over a radius of . All creatures inside that radius whose alignment matched that of the deity to which the candle was dedicated at the time of its construction enjoyed a boost to their innate abilities and resistances.\nMoreover, divine spellcasters such as druids and clerics had their abilities considerably augmented by the candle. Post-Second Sundering versions allowed the casters to cast their most basic spells without limit, while pre-Spellplague versions improved their connection to their deities, to the point of even granting them access to spells that would normally be beyond their nominal skill levels.\nAnother possible use for a candle of invocation was to use it to cast the gate spell to summon a creature whose alignment matched the candles dedicated deity. This power could only be used the first time the candle was lit, after which the candle was destroyed.\nA candle of invocation dedicated to the neutral evil deity Sseth was located in a yuan-ti temple within the Slitherswamp level of Undermountain."
