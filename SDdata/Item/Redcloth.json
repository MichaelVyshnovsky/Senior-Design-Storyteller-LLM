        "mainbody": "edcloths were red-hued pieces of fabric worn inside the undergarments by women of the Realms during their menstruation. They were used as a single layer or as a pair, and were sold by most inns and taverns during the day.\nRedcloths were washed daily in scented water or cheap wine, and rinsed in clear water (such as collected rain water). There was no social stigma attached to this act, and finding washing facilities in civilized areas such as towns or cities was an easy task this service was provided by every inn regardless of standing.\nWomen traveling the wilderness would wash redcloths in any sort of water, even using dew or stagnant swampwater. If no water could be found, old redcloths were buried to avoid being tracked by predators relying on scent.\nOld redcloths that couldnt be used anymore were disposed of by tavern owners, usually becoming scrubbing rags."
