        "mainbody": "The '''''dragonspear''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] linked to the [[black dragon]] [[Maelestor Rex]], which bound him to the service of the [[cornugon]] [[Vesarius]].",
        "Description": "The spear point was made from the black dragon's actual horn. It had a number of [[arcane]] [[spell]]s woven into its creation.",
        "Powers": "The ''dragonspear'' allowed Vesarius to command Maelestor Rex as he so desired. This power was not granted to anyone else who wielded or possessed the spear.",
        "History": "Long before the [[Era of Upheaval]], Maelestor Rex sought out the [[devil]] Vesarius with the aim to learn new [[magic]]al spells and better understand magic. Impressed by his intellect, Vesarius imparted the desired knowledge to the dragon, in exchange for one of his horns.\n\nMany years went by and the two beings had no interaction with one another, until shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1363}}. It was placed in an envelope of dark [[magic]]al energy that bent the fabric of time and space.\n\nDuring the [[Second Dragonspear War]], a group of adventurers were able to navigate the subterranean [[Nepenthe River]] to the dungeons beneath the castle and find the spear's location. and carried it back to the exterior of Dragonspear Castle. After the heroes brought the spear before Maelestor Rex, the black dragon used his [[acid]] breath to destroy the artifact and free himself from the control of Vesarius."
