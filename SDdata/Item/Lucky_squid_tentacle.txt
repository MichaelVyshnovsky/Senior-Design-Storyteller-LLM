Lucky squid tentacles were enchanted trinkets used by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords.
When tossed into the fray, lucky squid tentacles created an area of magical entanglement. Each trinket was a single-use enchanted item.
Lucky squid tentacles were in common use in the late-14 century DR in the Nelanther Isle. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose offered these wondrous items for sale, despite squids not having a reputation of being particularly lucky.
