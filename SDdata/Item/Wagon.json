        "mainbody": "A wagon was a four-wheeled, open-topped vehicle hauled behind a pair of horses or other beasts of burden,\nAn ideal wagon was about  long and about  wide. Animals that could move faster than horses could of course make a wagon travel faster.\nA wagon sold for about 35 gold pieces in most economies of Faerûn,\nSome wagons were equipped with a heavy or light catapult as a weapon.\nMerchants often came to the various trade fairs of Faerûn, selling goods from their wagons. Wagons were sometimes also used by armies to carry siege engines to battle.\nIn the city of Secomber, blocking a doorway or alleyway with ones wagon was a crime punishable by fine and with an edict forbidding the driving of wagon in the city again for a set time period. Parking in front of a city gate would earn a teamster a night in jail.\n* Vardo, a distinct type of wagon used by the Vistani."
