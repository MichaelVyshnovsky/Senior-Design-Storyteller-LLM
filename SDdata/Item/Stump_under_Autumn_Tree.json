        "mainbody": "Stump under Autumn Tree was a landscape painting created sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nThe landscape depicted a hazy gray afternoon over a lake or a river under two mountains looming over it and a shore with a lone stump cracked and shaped like a penitent. It was surrounded by pencil-shaving red and yellow autumn leaves and a nearby tree, with its foliage lit aflame with the colors of the fall. A lone sword was depicted further away, plunged into the rocks by the shore.\nIn the , a copy of Stump under Autumn Tree could be seen hanging in the second floor of the Forge of the Nine in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate."
