        "mainbody": "'''''Stump under Autumn Tree''''' was a landscape painting created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The landscape depicted a hazy gray afternoon over a lake or a river under two mountains looming over it and a shore with a lone stump cracked and shaped like a penitent. It was surrounded by pencil-shaving red and yellow autumn leaves and a nearby tree, with its foliage lit aflame with the colors of the fall. A lone [[sword]] was depicted further away, plunged into the rocks by the shore.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Stump under Autumn Tree'' could be seen hanging in the second floor of the [[Forge of the Nine]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
