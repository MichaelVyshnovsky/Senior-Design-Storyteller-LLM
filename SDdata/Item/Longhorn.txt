A longhorn was a type of Faer√ªnian flute that was commonly found in civilized regions, or in elven communities.
A Longhorn was considered to be a lyrical musical instrument. It was also very portable and easy to play, as well as elegant. This made the longhorn as popular as yartings among musicians.
Since longhorns were very sophisticated instruments, difficult to make, they could only be found in areas that held skilled artisans such as big cities and elven communities.
There were two types of longhorn the common longhorn, whose range covered middle to upper register, and the soprano (or sopranino) longhorn, which had a very high and piercing tone, similar to the chirping of birds. Both were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
* Bonnie Harper, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, had a longhorn that she played for ballads and abstract songs.
