        "mainbody": "A '''''walking chest''''', also called a '''''crawlchest''''' or if used for military purposes a '''''crawlchariot''''', was a [[magic item]] used to store things.",
        "Description": "A ''walking chest'' was a wooden strongchest or open cargo-box that walked on preserved [[giant spider]] legs, which were attached to the box or chest.\n\n''Crawlchariots'' were armored ''walking chests'' that were also equipped with weapons.",
        "Powers": "A ''walking chest'' was mentally directed by the owner of a control ring, made of [[silver]], pewter, and [[iron]]. In the case of a ''crawlchariot'', this was with a control brooch. The user needed to be within 40 ft (12 m).\n\nA ''walking chest'' could be directed to attack other creatures. A ''crawlchariot'' was equipped with harpoon guns to shoot lances. They defended themselves with their armor but sometimes also with pointed spikes or rotating blades to deter melee attacks against them.",
        "History": "''Walking chests'' were [[magic item]]s associated with the [[drow]]. Their academies, noble houses, and temples had two to five of them to carry goods like food, cleaning supplies, messages, or other items. ''Crawlchariots'' were magic items that were viewed as so important that they took special care to guard them."
