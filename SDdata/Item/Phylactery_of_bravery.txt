The phylactery of bravery was a magic item associated with Najm, the Zakharan goddess of adventure.
The phylactery was actually a gold-trimmed armband made from parchment inscribed with arcane metallic runes.
While wearing the phylactery and invoking the name of Najm, the wearer was infused with the goddess might, granting them supernatural valor and making it easier for them to strike down their foes during combat. Additionally, any emotion-based spells, such as fear, were less likely to succeed against them.
