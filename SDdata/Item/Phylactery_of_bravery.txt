The '''''phylactery of bravery''''' was a [[magic item]] associated with [[Najm]], the [[Zakhara|Zakharan]] goddess of adventure.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
The phylactery was actually a [[gold]]-trimmed armband made from [[parchment]] inscribed with arcane metallic runes.

==Powers==
While wearing the phylactery and invoking the name of Najm, the wearer was infused with the goddess' might, granting them supernatural valor and making it easier for them to strike down their foes during combat. Additionally, any emotion-based spells, such as ''[[fear]]'', were less likely to succeed against them.
