        "mainbody": "The '''''silver sickles of Soranth''''' were legendary [[enchanted]] weapons created by a fallen [[hierophant]] of [[Mielikki]].",
        "Description": "These magic [[sickle]]s were made of [[silver]] and shaped to resemble a four-edged razor-sharp crescent moon. Each of these weapons was decorated with four pictographs, one on each side of a blade. These images depicted a killing of a [[wolf]]-like creature in various ways. One image was of the wolf being drowned, the second showed it burning, the third showed the beast being crushed by rocks, and the last one showed it dying of asphyxiation. The handles were of carved [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and wrapped in blackened [[werewolf]] hide.",
        "Powers": "The ''silver sickles of Soranth'' were created with a ''+1'' enchantment and magically taught the users to wield weapons in both hands as they were forged out of silver to be double-wielded against [[shapechanger]]s. When these weapons were used to fight [[lycanthrope]]s or other shape-changing creatures, they functioned as ''+3'' enchanted sickles and dealt additional devastating damage to them.",
        "History": "Even though several of these blades existed, their location was a mystery. One of the ''silver sickles of Soranth'' was discovered in old catacombs underneath [[Elmwood]] of the [[Moonsea]] region in [[1373 DR]] during the time these dungeons were used as a lair by [[Eremuth Silverwind]]'s doppelganger, a [[malaugrym]] agent of the [[Unseen]]."
