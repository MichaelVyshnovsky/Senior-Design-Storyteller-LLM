'''Onion soup''' was a classic form of savory soup in the [[Icewind Dale]] region

==Description==
This dish largely consisted of meat-stock and [[onion]]s, covered in [[cheese]] and [[bread]]. The soup had a watery consistency and was topped with crusty bread.

==Availability==
Onion soup was part of the morningfeat offerings in Mistledale, served alongside [[spice]]d [[scrambled eggs]], with diced [[tomato]]es and [[onion]]s, [[fried bread]], and [[black sausage]].

The shops simply known as [[Landaeyr's]], ran by the [[Landaeyr]] family in there years before the [[Spellplague]], offered their customers sizable mugs of hearty broth-and-onion soup for a single [[copper]] [[coin|piece]]. These humble eateries could be found in [[Suzail]], just by the northeastern city gate.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021210738/https://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-09.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr â€“ Jun 2009| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

In [[Yartar]] of the [[Dessarin Valley]], onion soup with [[lentil]]s and [[rice]] was served at [[Beldar's Rest]] inn.

An especially foul-smelling onion soup could be found in [[Vahtov]] of the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]].
