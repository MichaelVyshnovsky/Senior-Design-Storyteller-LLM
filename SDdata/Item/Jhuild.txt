Jhuild, also known as Rashemi firewine, Rashemaar firewine, or thrallwine, was considered to be the national drink of Rashemen.
Jhuild was a thick, dark reddish-brown alcoholic beverage that created the sensation of fire in the imbibers belly, thus earning its name. Jhuild was an extremely potent and spicy wine, and was reputed to have medicinal qualities. The Witches of Rashemen grew the herbs, grapes, and fruits that were used in distilling the wine in the magic-laced soil of the Urlingwood. It was often used as part of a berserker warriors ritual of invoking the berserker rage.
A form of this beverage was also brewed in Thesk, where it was known as thrallwine. It was used by slave owners to dull the minds of their slaves and lower their sense of personal free will.
A derivative of thrallwine from Thesk could be used as a potent drug that, as the name suggested, enthralled the imbiber, keeping them docile and dimwitted.
Jhuild was usually served in tall glasses, and as of 1372 DR, its average price was set at around 120 gold pieces per bottle outside of Rashemens borders. In Rashemen, jhuild was fairly affordable, costing 1 gold piece per pint. A diluted form of jhuild, which was made using ale, was also much more affordable at 15 gold pieces per bottle. However, other sources reported a bottle of jhuild cost about 70 gold pieces in Rashemen, and that the diluted version sold for 2 silver pieces a tankard in Rashemen and 7 to 15 gold pieces elsewhere.
Firewine was a popular house liquor from Nat Wylers Bell in Phlan. The taverns locals told stories about the firewine being distilled from their own wine, mulled in a washtub. Beyond Toril, one could find firewine being sold in Sigil.
