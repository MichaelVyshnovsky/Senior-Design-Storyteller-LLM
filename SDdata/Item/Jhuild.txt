'''Jhuild''', also known as '''Rashemi firewine''', '''Rashemaar firewine''', or '''thrallwine''', was considered to be the national drink of [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
Jhuild was a thick, dark reddish-brown alcoholic beverage that created the sensation of fire in the imbiber's belly, thus earning its name.<ref> Jhuild was an extremely potent and spicy wine, and was reputed to have medicinal qualities. The [[Witches of Rashemen]] grew the [[herb]]s, grapes, and fruits that were used in distilling the wine in the magic-laced soil of the [[Urlingwood]].<ref> It was often used as part of a [[Berserker (Rashemi)|berserker]] warrior's ritual of invoking the berserker rage.

A form of this beverage was also brewed in [[Thesk]], where it was known as thrallwine. It was used by [[slave]] owners to dull the minds of their slaves and lower their sense of personal free will.

A derivative of thrallwine from Thesk could be used as a potent drug that, as the name suggested, enthralled the imbiber, keeping them docile and dimwitted.

==Price==
Jhuild was usually served in tall glasses, and as of [[1372 DR]], its average price was set at around 120 [[gold piece]]s per bottle outside of Rashemen's borders. In Rashemen, jhuild was fairly affordable, costing 1 gold piece per pint. A diluted form of jhuild, which was made using ale, was also much more affordable at 15 gold pieces per bottle. However, other sources reported a bottle of jhuild cost about 70 gold pieces in Rashemen, and that the diluted version sold for 2 [[silver piece]]s a tankard in Rashemen and 7 to 15 gold pieces elsewhere.

==Availability==
Firewine was a popular house liquor from [[Nat Wyler's Bell]] in [[Phlan]]. The tavern's locals told stories about the firewine being distilled from their own wine, mulled in a washtub. Beyond [[Toril]], one could find firewine being sold in [[Sigil]].
