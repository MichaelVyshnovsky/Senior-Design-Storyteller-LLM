Flaming was an enchantment that caused flames to sheathe a weapon.
This quality was command-word activated and the flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. The flames burned a target upon being struck. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition launched from them.
The creator must use flame blade, flame strike, or fireball to add the flaming property.
Movanic devas typically wielded flaming greatswords.
Some experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as flaming weapons.
