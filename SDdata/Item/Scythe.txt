A scythe () was a farm implement that could be used as a two-handed, martial melee weapon.
A scythe was a long, curved, sharp-pointed, one-sided blade mounted at 90&deg on a shaped haft and was normally used for harvesting wheat or corn. The blade was tilted and the haft was shaped to make it easy to swing just above the ground and cut the crop stalks. One or two handles might jut out of the haft to make it more comfortable to swing in a mowing fashion.
It took two hands to wield a scythe and some training to use it effectively. They could be used to pierce or slash an opponent, much in the same manner as some pole arms, like the halberd, though it did not have a comparable reach. And because their blades were long and slightly curved, scythes could be used to trip opponents.
