The staff of flames was an enchanted ancient elven quarterstaff that belonged to an unknown wizard buried in the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor.
The staff of flame appeared to be a simple wooden quarterstaff singed and charred by flames. Its magic protected the weapon from actually receiving fire damage and disintegrating into ash.
Staff of flames was able to cast the flame strike spell and, despite its fragile damaged appearance, had a +4 enchantment.
In 1369 DR, a staff of flames could be found in the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor, inside its former owners tomb. The owner itself could be found not far in its undead form of a mohrg.
