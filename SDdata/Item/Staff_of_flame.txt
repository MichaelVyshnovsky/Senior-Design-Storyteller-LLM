}}The '''''staff of flames''''' was an enchanted ancient [[elf|elven]] [[quarterstaff]] that belonged to an unknown [[wizard]] buried in the [[Elven Catacombs]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''staff of flame'' appeared to be a simple wooden quarterstaff singed and charred by flames. Its magic protected the weapon from actually receiving fire damage and disintegrating into ash.

==Powers==
''Staff of flames'' was able to cast the ''[[flame strike]]'' spell and, despite its fragile damaged appearance, had a +4 enchantment.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], a ''staff of flames'' could be found in the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor, inside its former owner's tomb. The owner itself could be found not far in its [[undead]] form of a [[mohrg]].
