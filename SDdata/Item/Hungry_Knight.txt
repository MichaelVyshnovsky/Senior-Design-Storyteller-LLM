The '''Hungry Knight''' was a signature dish from the [[Singing Sprite]] inn of [[Secomber]].

==Description==
The Hungry Knight was a disgusting-looking platter of [[flatbread]] rolls stuffed with [[chicken]] [[fowl liver|livers]] that had been fried in [[garlic butter]], garnished with diced pepper [[potato]]es and [[dill]]. Despite the appearance, it was a delicious savory dish.

==Availability==
The Hungry Knight was a signature dish served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside [[Three Crabs]] and [[A Trio of Trumpets]]. The dish sold for 7 [[gp]], though this also included two tallglasses of [[mead]], [[milk]], [[wine]] or [[tankard]]s of [[ale]], as well as plentiful hot [[butter]]ed [[bread]] rolls and [[biscuit]]s that could sate additional guests.
