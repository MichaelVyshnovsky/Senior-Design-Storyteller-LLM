A spider fang was a type of magic dagger with the power to create and cut through webs.
It was black or dark purple in color.
It was a magical +1, or +3 dagger, that had the ability to cut through natural and magical webs without getting stuck, allowing the wielder to move through webbed areas with more ease.
Once per day each, it could both weave a web and a curtain made of cobwebs. This was 10-feet-square (3m) and was suitable for hiding or concealment. If a curtain was created and a creature touched it, it collapsed and damaged the creature with acid.
Creating of a spider fang dagger involved the use of ichor and web silk from driders or large spiders,   and required use of the spells grease, acid arrow, possibly shield, and web, 
The daggers were worth 11,782 gp.
