Halurskan wine was a fermented alcoholic beverage created by Halurska the Fat, a baked of the city of Berdusk long before the 14 century DR.
The wine was a black and nutty-tasting alcoholic beverage made from mushrooms. It was commonly served by the Church of Milil during revels at Evensong Tower, a many-spired temple dedicated to Milil.
