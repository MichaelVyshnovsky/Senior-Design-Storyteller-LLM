        "mainbody": "'''''Black ice ioun stones''''' were [[enchanted]] [[gem]]s that floated around a bearer's head, imbuing magics onto the owner.",
        "Powers": "These magic items were created when an ''[[ioun stone]]'' was exposed to the corrupting powers of ''[[black ice]]''. When one of these ''ioun stones'' was activated, it granted the owner magically increased defense when they were hit by an opponent, and additionally it increased the speed of the wearer's allies.",
        "History": "''Black ice ioun stones'' started appearing in the northern region of [[Icewind Dale]] ''circa'' [[1485 DR]], following the influx in production of items of ''black ice'' that originated in [[Kelvin's Cairn]] and led by [[Baerick Hammerstone]] who attempted to wrestle the leadership position from [[Stokely Silverstream]] of [[Clan Battlehammer]]."
