'''''Handglyphs of power''''' were [[enchanted]] medallions capable of unleashing offensive [[Arcane magic|magic]].

==Description==
These medallions were typically {{SI|3|in|m}} to {{SI|4|in|m}} in diameter. A battle glyph would be found on the front of the medallion, and the back was decorated with the wheel symbol of [[Nog]] and [[Kadar]]. Small [[chain]]s were often attached to ''handglyphs of power'' so they could be worn around the neck or wrist.

==Powers==
The battle glyph of the ''handglyph of power'' was faced toward an enemy and, when the [[command word]] was uttered, a deadly offensive [[spell]] was released at the target. Though other spells could be stored in these items, common spells included ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', and ''[[death spell]]''. The maximum effective range of a ''handglyph of power'' was {{SI|90|ft}}.

==History==
The secret of recharging these deadly weapons was revealed by [[Kazerabet]] in her tome the ''[[Art of Necromancy]]''. In her book, Kazerabet hinted at the existence of even more powerful [[handglyph]]s called ''[[stunglyph]]s'', ''[[blindglyph]]s'', and ''[[deathglyph]]s'' that contained the power of ''[[power word, stun]]'', ''[[Power word, blind|blind]]'', and ''[[power word, death|death]]'' respectively.

==Notable Owners==
Kazerabet, a powerful [[necromancer]] inhabiting the isle of [[Sahu]], wielded a ''handglyph of power''.
