The Athora was a gigantic alien rock located under Thaymount, which greatly enhanced magic spell and magic items. It was considered one of the major reasons behind the power of the Red Wizards of Thay.
In addition to its innate abilities to empower magic, the Athora was a weave anchor, helping Mystra stabilize the Weave.
The Athora was created by the Baetith. It was located in the Assikhath, a cavern deep under Thaymount guarded by powerful protective statues.
