A potion of gaseous form was an magic item capable of turning the imbiber into a cloud of gas.
When consumed, this potion would transform the imbibers body, along with all of their carried equipment, into a transparent and insubstantial sluggish cloud of gas. While in this form the imbiber could only be harmed by magical fire, lightning, or whirlwind attacks. The gaseous form could squeeze through anywhere that was not air tight. These effects last for 40â€“90 minutes.
Vampire dust was used in brewing potions of gaseous form, but it could be substituted for three jarred dead vapor rats.
Pizentios, a vile necromancer from Zakhara, carried a potion of gaseous form.
