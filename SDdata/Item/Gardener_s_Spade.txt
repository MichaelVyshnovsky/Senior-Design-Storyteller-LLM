'''''Gardener's Spade''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Chauntean]] [[staff]] with a [[spade]] head attached to one end.

==Description==
''Gardener's Spade'' was a weapon and a tool that had seen the passage of many years. Its [[willow]] [[tree]] [[wood]] was tinted with green, and the shovel head appeared fragile. Despite its flimsy appearance, the ''Gardener's Spade's'' magics made it virtually unbreakable.

==Powers==
''Gardener's Spade'' was touched by the [[Earthmother]] herself. [[Chauntea]]'s ''[[bless]]ings'' gave the staff a ''+1'' enchantment and fortified the wielder's constitution. Additionally, ''Gardener's Spade'' could heal with a single casting of the ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' once a day.

==History==
''Gardener's Spade'' belonged to [[Goodwife Aruna]] of [[Wanderfen]], who became a refugee in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} shortly after the [[Shadow War]] scarred the [[Sword Coast North]]. She carried her Chauntean weapon to her new home in the village of [[West Harbor]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. She offered the ''Spade'' to any adventurer driven enough to recover her lost shawl from the lair of twin [[black dragon]]s [[Voaraghamanthar]] and [[Waervaerendor]].
