The '''''staff of the sands''''' was a magical item that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|52}}{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
These magical items were available in a wide variety.

==Powers==
These staves granted the following powers to a wizard at the expense of one charge: ''[[move sand]]'', ''[[sand slumber]]'', ''[[sand sword]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]'', and ''[[traceless travel]]''.

The following powers consumed two charges for regular wizards and only one charge for [[Elemental mage|sand mages]]: ''[[conjure earth elemental]]'', ''[[desert fist]]'', and ''[[create shade]]''.

Sand mages gained exclusive access to the ''[[sink]]'' power at the expense of four charges.

Any mage holding the staff gained the advantage of the ''[[cool strength]]'' spell so long as they maintained contact with the staff.
