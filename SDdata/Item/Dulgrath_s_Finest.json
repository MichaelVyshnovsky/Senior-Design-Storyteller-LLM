        "mainbody": "'''Dulgrath's Finest''' was a variety of exceedingly rare [[wine]] made by [[Baroness Dulgrath]] of [[Aglarond]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Baroness Dulgrath attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. She participated in a [[wine]]-tasting and competition with her so-called \"Dulgrath's Finest,\" aged in [[barrel]]s made of [[enchanted]] [[Yuirwood]] wood. Lady Dulgrath was not a professional vintner and did not export the wine out of Aglarond, but she received many compliments on the drink she created. Dulgrath brought several [[cask]]s of her wine for the competition but was extremely protective of the batch, refusing to serve Dulgrath's Finest to adventurers. It was unrecorded if Dulgrath's Finest won the competition."
