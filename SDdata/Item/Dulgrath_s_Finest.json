She participated in a wine-tasting and competition with her so-called \"Dulgraths Finest,\" aged in barrels made of enchanted Yuirwood wood. Lady Dulgrath was not a professional vintner and did not export the wine out of Aglarond, but she received many compliments on the drink she created. Dulgrath brought several casks of her wine for the competition but was extremely protective of the batch, refusing to serve Dulgraths Finest to adventurers. It was unrecorded if Dulgraths Finest won the competition."
