'''''Sashes of the Black Raven''''' were [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s, symbols of the [[Black Raven Monastery]], dedicated to the near mythical figure in [[Uthgardt]] legends â€“ [[Black Raven (person)|Black Raven]].

==Description==
These black sashes were made of fine [[silk]], possibly [[spider silk]].

==Powers==
''Sashes of the Black Raven'' magically strengthened hands of the monks who wore them, increasing the punishment dealt similarly to a ''+1'' enchantment. Additionally, the belts gave the wearer immunity to ''[[confusion]]'' and ''[[feeblemind]]'' spells and effects. If anyone but a monk attempted to wear a ''sash of the Black Raven'', it immediately unknotted itself and fell on the ground.

==History==
One of these sashes could be found among possessions of [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]], enchantress wife of Speaker [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}}.
