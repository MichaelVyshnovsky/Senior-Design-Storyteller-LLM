        "mainbody": "'''''Clubs of smiting''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons created to destroy [[construct]]s and found in common use in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Clubs of smiting'' bore a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's arm towards the target and increased the weapon's damage output. However, these weapons' true power was in using them to battle constructs. Each successful attack with a ''club of smiting'' had a chance of interfering with the magics that animated constructs, instantly and completely destroying them.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''clubs of smiting'' could be found in the hands of [[adventurer]]s in the city of [[Neverwinter]], as well as found in the depths of [[Undermountain]], the massive [[dungeon]] underneath the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]."
