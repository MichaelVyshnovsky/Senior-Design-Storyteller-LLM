        "mainbody": "An '''''orc stone''''' was a [[magic item]] that could be used to summon the [[spirit]] of an [[orc]] in battle.",
        "Description": "They were small stones carved with the symbol of an orc tribe, such as the [[Many-Arrows tribe]].",
        "Powers": "An ''orc stone'' could only be used and attuned to by a person to whom it had been gifted.\n\nOn three occasions, an ''orc stone'' could be used to summon the spirit of an orc warrior or war chief, which looked exactly as the orc had when they were alive. The spirit would appear within {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} of the ''stone's'' wielder, and would fight on their behalf until it was destroyed or until ten minutes had passed. The spirit was able to speak the same language as the holder of the ''orc stone'', and would obey their orders.\n\nAfter its third and final use, an ''orc stone'' crumbled into dust.",
        "History": "One such ''orc stone'' was known to contain the spirit of [[Vokarr|Vokarr the Eyebiter]], and found its way to [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn rare cases, an ''orc stone'' might be given as a gift by a member of the Many-Arrows tribe to honor someone who had saved their life."
