        "mainbody": "An orc stone was a magic item that could be used to summon the spirit of an orc in battle.\nThey were small stones carved with the symbol of an orc tribe, such as the Many-Arrows tribe.\nAn orc stone could only be used and attuned to by a person to whom it had been gifted.\nOn three occasions, an orc stone could be used to summon the spirit of an orc warrior or war chief, which looked exactly as the orc had when they were alive. The spirit would appear within  of the stones wielder, and would fight on their behalf until it was destroyed or until ten minutes had passed. The spirit was able to speak the same language as the holder of the orc stone, and would obey their orders.\nAfter its third and final use, an orc stone crumbled into dust.\nOne such orc stone was known to contain the spirit of Vokarr the Eyebiter, and found its way to Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR.\nIn rare cases, an orc stone might be given as a gift by a member of the Many-Arrows tribe to honor someone who had saved their life."
