Furthermore, the item description mentions a daimyo, which is a title exclusive to the Kara-Turan countries of [[Wa]] and [[Kozakura]] (both of which are Japan analogues). Therefore, ''Morohanotsurugi'' likely originated in either Wa or Kozakura, but not enough information is given to ascertain which one specifically.",

        "History": "After a perceived slight from one of his serfs, the Kara-Turan liege lord [[Yodama Akira]] ordered an entire village burned to the ground. Although this was well within his right as a lord, Yodama's [[daimyo]] was deeply shamed by his actions. As a result, the daimyo commissioned ''Morohanotsurugi'' and gave it to Yodama to teach him the lesson that harming others should never be without consequence.",
