        "mainbody": "Morohanotsurugi was a cursed wakizashi from Kara-Tur.\nAlthough a powerful magical weapon, Morohanotsurugi was cursed to inflict grievous damage to its wielder when swung.\nAfter a perceived slight from one of his serfs, the Kara-Turan liege lord Yodama Akira ordered an entire village burned to the ground. Although this was well within his right as a lord, Yodamas daimyo was deeply shamed by his actions. As a result, the daimyo commissioned Morohanotsurugi and gave it to Yodama to teach him the lesson that harming others should never be without consequence.\n*Yodama Akira"
