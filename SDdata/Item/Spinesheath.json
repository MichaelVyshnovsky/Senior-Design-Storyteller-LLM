        "mainbody": "The spinesheath was a unique enchanted stiletto.\nThe blade of this stiletto was specially designed to pierce through armor.\nThe spinesheath possessed a +1 enchantment.\nThis stiletto first belonged to an assassin in Calimport by the name of Beledor, until one day he was poisoned by a bribed servant. The weapons name was derived from his tendency to plunge its blade it into the backs of his targets.\nOver time spinesheath changed hands, until ending up in the possession of a lizard king lairing in the Dragons Eye in 1281 DR."
