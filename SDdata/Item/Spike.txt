Spikes were large metal rods that were pointed at one end (essentially giant nails), used in carpentry, construction, and adventuring. They belonged to a class of hardware that also included bolts and pegs, and were very similar to pitons.
Spikes were most often between  and  long, made from iron with a square cross-section. Depending on their purpose they could be made with a simple flattened head, or with an eyehole for looping a rope, carabiner, or some other device.
Aside from bolts, nails, and pegs, spikes also had a resemblance to stakes.
Nails were made by blacksmiths as part of their regular work.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of spikes and related tools. Spikes could be had in  (3 gp/dozen) and  (5 gp/dozen) lengths.
When used for joining wood in carpentry, the spike could be set using an auger to make a shallow indentation, or have a hole partially bored out with a bow drill. Once the surface was prepared, the spike could be suitably struck with a hammer or mallet.
Eyeholed spikes were a vital part of a climbers tools, as they could be driven into stone to provide attachment points for rope. Spikes built specifically for climbing were generally known as pitons.
Adventurers found ready uses for spikes beyond climbing, with the most obvious being that of spiking doors shut to prevent unexpected entry, and wedging them open to ensure easy access. Because of the sheer size and durability, a large spike was a perfectly acceptable emergency weapon, easily capable of clubbing or impaling a target. If nothing else, they could simply be thrown at suspected traps to detect or trigger them safely.
Hold monster used a metal rod as a material component, such as a nail or spike.
The statue spell could be cast using a mixture of lime, sand, and water stirred by an iron nail or spike.
