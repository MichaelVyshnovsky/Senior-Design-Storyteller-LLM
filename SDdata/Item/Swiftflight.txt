'''Swiftflight''' was an intelligent magic ''+3 mighty composite [[oathbow]]'' carried by [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] and made for him by his half-brother [[Tyresia]] as a parting gift. It contained some of Tyresia's personality, so Methrammar was particularly fond of it.{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rp/20021009a|title=Methrammar Aerasumé|author=[[Gwendolyn F.M.
