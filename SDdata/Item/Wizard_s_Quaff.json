        "mainbody": "Wizards Quaff was an ale brewed in Voonlar specifically for the Whistling Wizard inn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nMore accurately described as a small beer, the Wizards Quaff was a locally brewed, low-quality drink. Its only redeeming feature was that it was free to those staying in the inn. The price for non-paying guests was likely a copper or two, but few willingly chose to have another round if they could afford better.\nCategory0-24 gold pieces\nCategoryAlcohol\nCategoryIntoxicating substances\nCategoryAles\nCategoryFood and drink from the Whistling Wizard\nCategoryFood and drink from Voonlar\nCategoryFood and drink from the Moonsea\nCategoryFood and drink from North Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from Toril\nCategoryFood and drink\nCategoryBeverages\n1ujhdfeotzohpivqaxj0u1kqeef92pf"
