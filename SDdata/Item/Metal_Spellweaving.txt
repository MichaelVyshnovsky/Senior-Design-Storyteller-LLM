'''''Metal Spellweaving''''' was a crafting book written by the [[mage]] [[Shraevyn]]. It was a dense tome, with a cover made of [[platinum]]. The book discussed the best order in which to cast [[spell]]s into a weapon. The pages were full of columns of percentages, graphs and diagrams expressed with pedantic detail.
