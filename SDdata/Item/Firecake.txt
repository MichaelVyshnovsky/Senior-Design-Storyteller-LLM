'''Firecake''' was a simple type of fried food from the city of [[Velen]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Availability==
Firecakes were served at [[The Figureheadless]] tavern in Velen alongside nauseating [[fishhead soup]] and [[frybread]]s. The main ingredients of these handfoods were "found meats," such as [[fish]], [[rodent]]s, and other less savory creatures. The meat was chopped and generously mixed with hot [[pepper]]s to mask the taste. Then the meat was breaded and fried. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] warned his readers that firecakes were for people with strong stomachs.
