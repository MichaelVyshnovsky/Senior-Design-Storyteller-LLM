        "mainbody": "Brewmasters cudgel was the enchanted club passed from one brewmaster of Hanseath in Myth Drannors Halls of Light to the next one.\nBrewmasters cudgel did not appear special in any way. It was wooden, heavy, worn-out, and knotty.\nThe clubs enchantment allowed the wielder of the weapon to deal triple damage when used against the undead.\nBefore the fall of Myth Drannor, the brewmasters cudgel belonged to the last brewmaster of the city, Durlin. He died wielding the club against the invading Army of Darkness in the Dwarven Dungeons. The cudgel changed hands multiple times after the citys fall, being passed along from one creature to another that infested the ruins of the city."
