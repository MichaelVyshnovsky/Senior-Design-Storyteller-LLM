        "mainbody": "'''''Brewmaster's cudgel''''' was the [[Enchanted weapon|enchanted]] [[club]] passed from one brewmaster of [[Hanseath]] in [[Myth Drannor]]'s [[Halls of Light]] to the next one.",
        "Description": "Brewmaster's cudgel did not appear special in any way. It was wooden, heavy, worn-out, and knotty.",
        "Powers": "The club's enchantment allowed the wielder of the weapon to deal triple damage when used against the [[undead]].",
        "History": "Before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], the ''brewmaster's cudgel'' belonged to the last brewmaster of the city, [[Durlin]]. He died wielding the club against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. The cudgel changed hands multiple times after the city's fall, being passed along from one creature to another that infested the ruins of the city."
