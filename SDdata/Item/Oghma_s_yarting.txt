Oghmas yarting was an enchanted musical instrument carried by avatars of Oghma, god of knowledge and patron of bards.
This instrument was a yarting, a stringed instrument that resembled a guitar, and it was made of white snowwood. Oghma typically wore it on a leather cord around his back. It was tuned to perfection.
Oghmas yarting could play any note or any song or mimic any sound with perfection. It could even sound like several instruments playing together at the same time.
Oghma could use the yarting to influence the emotions of those who heard it, turning hostile beings completely happy and peaceful, or make them so sad and despairing that they could do nothing but weep. He could even whip listeners into a rage, transforming them into true berserkers who would ferociously attack any target with greater force, though they might resist the magic.
The yarting was thought to possess more magical powers, but they possibly changed each time and sages debated which they were.
Oghma could of course play the yarting with unmatched talent. His avatars were usually seen playing the finest ballads of Faer√ªn for the benefit of any who happened to hear.
He occasionally lent the yarting to devout followers of his to use while they were acting in some matter he considered important. However, once loaned, its powers could differ from those Oghma commanded.
