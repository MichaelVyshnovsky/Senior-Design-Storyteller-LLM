Salbread was a popular type of bread baked by the creative halflings of Luiren.
Because it lasted for tendays before spoiling, and contained much more flavor than standard breads, salbread was made for sailors and other travelers. Salbread was baked in square pans, allowing for easy storage when travelling. Lemon or orange peels were one of the main ingredients, making it very popular with sailors not only because of the added flavor, but because the orange and lemon peels helped prevent scurvy.
