'''Salbread''' was a popular type of [[bread]] baked by the creative [[halfling]]s of [[Luiren]].

==Description==
Because it lasted for [[tenday]]s before spoiling, and contained much more flavor than standard breads, salbread was made for sailors and other travelers. Salbread was baked in square pans, allowing for easy storage when travelling. [[Lemon tree|Lemon]] or [[orange]] peels were one of the main ingredients, making it very popular with sailors not only because of the added flavor, but because the orange and lemon peels helped prevent [[scurvy]].
