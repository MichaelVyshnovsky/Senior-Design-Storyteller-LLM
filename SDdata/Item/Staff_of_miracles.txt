A '''''staff of miracles''''' was an ancient, [[magic]]al [[elven]] weapon of old [[Myth Drannor]] that, while common there, was quite rare in 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They possessed a number of powerful abilites and [[spell]]-like effects.{{Cite dragon/173/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A wizard's staff is to lean on}}

==Description==
The staff was made from [[white wood]] and adorned with the various [[Morndinsamman|dwarven]], [[Seldarine|elven]], [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnome]], [[Yondalla's Children|halfling]], and [[human]] [[deities]] once worshiped within [[Myth Drannor]]. 

==Powers==
When held, the staff would flash a brilliant, blue-white radiance and grant a ''+4 protection'' to up to four beings touching it. It also allowed the wielder to cast the spells ''[[heal]]'', once per day, and allowed them to delay death, as per the spell ''[[death's door]]'', once per day.

Additionally, once every 66 days, the ''staff of miracles'' granted the wielder one ''[[limited wish]]'', with a few caveats. It did not age the wielder, could not be used to reverse a death caused by the staff and could only undo or reverse any actions taken within a minute prior of being cast.

==Creation==
Analogous to the powers the staff granted, the spells ''heal'', ''holy aura'' and ''rosemantle'' were used during its creation.
