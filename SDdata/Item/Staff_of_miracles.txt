A staff of miracles was an ancient, magical elven weapon of old Myth Drannor that, while common there, was quite rare in 14 century DR. They possessed a number of powerful abilites and spell-like effects.
The staff was made from white wood and adorned with the various dwarven, elven, gnome, halfling, and human deities once worshiped within Myth Drannor. 
When held, the staff would flash a brilliant, blue-white radiance and grant a +4 protection to up to four beings touching it. It also allowed the wielder to cast the spells heal, once per day, and allowed them to delay death, as per the spell deaths door, once per day.
Additionally, once every 66 days, the staff of miracles granted the wielder one limited wish, with a few caveats. It did not age the wielder, could not be used to reverse a death caused by the staff and could only undo or reverse any actions taken within a minute prior of being cast.
Analogous to the powers the staff granted, the spells heal, holy aura and rosemantle were used during its creation.
