'''Lolth's candles''' were luminescent flickering [[crystal]]s found in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
These glowing [[gem]]s emitted a flickering glow that more than once lured unlucky Underdark travelers to their dooms. Many confused Lolth's candles with fellow travelers' flickering lanterns in the darkness of the underground.

==Availability==
Lolth's candles could be found in the area of [[Underdark]] just below the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Usages==
These crystals could be refined into vitriol of Lolth's Candle, which, in turn, could be mixed with certain types of ash in order to create a powerful blinding [[poison]] called ''[[Malice]]''.
