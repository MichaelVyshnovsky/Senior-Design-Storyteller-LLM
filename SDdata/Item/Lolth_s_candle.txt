Lolths candles were luminescent flickering crystals found in the Underdark.
These glowing gems emitted a flickering glow that more than once lured unlucky Underdark travelers to their dooms. Many confused Lolths candles with fellow travelers flickering lanterns in the darkness of the underground.
Lolths candles could be found in the area of Underdark just below the Western Heartlands.
These crystals could be refined into vitriol of Lolths Candle, which, in turn, could be mixed with certain types of ash in order to create a powerful blinding poison called Malice.
