The Blackthorn was a unique piece of headwear that originated from the Feywild.
The  crown-like headpiece was an intimidating sight to behold.
The wearer of the Blackthorn was granted protection against physical harm and given enhanced vitality.
Any individual who harmed the wearer was similarly damaged, and would fumble any other attacks they made.
As of the late 15 century DR, the Blackthorn could be found in the depths of Malabogs Castle deep within his realm in the Feywild.
