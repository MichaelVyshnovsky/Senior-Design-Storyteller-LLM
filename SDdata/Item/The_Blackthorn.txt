'''The Blackthorn''' was a unique piece of headwear that originated from the [[Feywild]].

==Description==
The  crown-like headpiece was an intimidating sight to behold.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''Blackthorn'' was granted protection against physical harm and given enhanced vitality.

Any individual who harmed the wearer was similarly damaged, and would fumble any other attacks they made.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Blackthorn'' could be found in the depths of [[Malabog's Castle]] deep within his [[Realm of Malabog|realm]] in the Feywild.
