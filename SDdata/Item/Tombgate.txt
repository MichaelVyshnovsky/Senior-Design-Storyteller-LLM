Tombgate was a portal spanning Tsarn Tombs and Eveningstar.
One end of the gate was at Eveningstar Gorge just a little way from Eveningstar itself. It led to Tsarn Tombs near Scornubel.
In , Tessaril Winter took Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith through the portal in disguise. They arrived at Tsarn Tombs near Scornubel, atop a hill, within sight of a road leading to a ferry.
The portal was known to the Zhentarim scriers Korthauvar Hammantle and Hlael Toraunt, who, by eavesdropping on a group of Highknights, confirmed Tessaril had went with two people through a portal, and sent a skull-token elsewhere. The portal was already known to them to have been used by Tessaril and two companions.
Tessaril later informed Lhaeo which portal she used and sent a skull token that would teleport one to the same location.
Hlael Toraunt thought Hesperdan would know where Tombgate led.
