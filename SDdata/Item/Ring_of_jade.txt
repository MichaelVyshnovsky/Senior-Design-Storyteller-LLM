'''''Rings of jade''''' were common minor magic items found across the [[Sword Coast]] and exported out of [[Kara-Tur]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These [[jade]] [[ring]]s were imbued with simple [[enchantment]]s that made them glow with soft green light, illuminating an area of {{SI|15'|'"|long=yes}} around them.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, these common pieces of enchanted jade were found across many pockets, fingers, and merchant stalls of the Sword Coast. They were especially popular among adventurers, freeing their hand for weapons and tools instead of holding [[lantern]]s and [[torch]]es. As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''rings of jade'' were sold at [[Okuzo's Imports]], a shop that dealt with exotic Kara-Turan goods, located on the [[Harbor Loop]] in [[Westgate]].
