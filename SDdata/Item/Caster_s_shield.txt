Casters shield was the enchanted shield created by Janice Whentom specifically to be helpful to warrior-wizards in battle.
This shield had a +1 enchantment, and its design specifically decreased the chance of arcane spell failure when handled by a mage.
Janice Whentom was a skilled and ambitious warrior wizard who wanted to carry a large shield into battle and wear her thick armor. She created and enchanted this shield to allow herself to support the battalion she was a part of. Subsequently, casters shield failed to defend its mistress as Janice died on the battlefield, felled by a stray arrow. Honoring her service and friendship, Janices battalion returned the shield to the Whentom family.
Casters shield remained with the Whentoms until sometime before 1372 DR. Eventually, the shield found its way into the old crypt underneath Gillians Hill not far from Daggerford.
