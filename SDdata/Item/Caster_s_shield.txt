'''''Caster's shield''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[shield]] created by [[Janice Whentom]] specifically to be helpful to [[warrior]]-[[wizard]]s in battle.

==Powers==
This shield had a ''+1'' enchantment, and its design specifically decreased the chance of [[arcane]] spell failure when handled by a mage.

==History==
Janice Whentom was a skilled and ambitious warrior wizard who wanted to carry a large shield into battle and wear her thick armor. She created and enchanted this shield to allow herself to support the battalion she was a part of. Subsequently, ''caster's shield'' failed to defend its mistress as Janice died on the battlefield, felled by a stray [[arrow]]. Honoring her service and friendship, Janice's battalion returned the shield to the Whentom family.

''Caster's shield'' remained with the Whentoms until sometime before [[1372 DR]]. Eventually, the shield found its way into the old crypt underneath [[Gillian's Hill]] not far from [[Daggerford]].
