'''''Swords of the solars''''' were exotic [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]]s wielded by [[solar]]s of the [[Celestial planes]].

==Powers==
These huge grand swords were enchanted to be used by the strongest of the [[angel]]s, solars. Their fearsome might and a ''+5'' enchantment could cleave almost any enemy with one strike, somewhat akin to the ''[[vorpal]]'' magical quality. These swords also burnt as bright as the brightest torch, emitting white light {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} around them.

==History==
Long before [[1374 DR]], one of these swords was sealed underneath a chasm-ridden plain in [[Thar]], not far from the swamps of [[Iyrauroth]], the Wyrm of the Peaks. Of course, the sword was wielded by its owner at the time. She was the unnamed [[fallen solar]] who was the reason for the chasms that scarred the land around her magical prison.
