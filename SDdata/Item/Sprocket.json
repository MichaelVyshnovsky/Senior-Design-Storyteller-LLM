This included four large, stone flywheels that each sported an axle and were connected to a series of gears. Upon each axle was a sprocket, which could be slid along to engage a different part of the machinery.\n\nDuring the time of the [[Everlasting Rime]], a [[gnome]] [[artificer]] by the name of [[Doxi Whirglitz]] constructed a clockwork [[knucklehead trout]], a [[construct]] whose design featured sprockets.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Great Knucklehead Rally|7}}\n\nWhen a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Halls of the Hunting Axe in [[1491 DR]], they had to manipulate those sprockets in order to gain access to Tormhild's decoy tomb."
