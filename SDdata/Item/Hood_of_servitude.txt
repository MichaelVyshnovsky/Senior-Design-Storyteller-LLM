The '''''hood of servitude''''' was a magical animal hood that originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
This item looked like a regular [[falcon]] hood.

==Powers==
When placed upon the head of any flying creature, the ''hood of servitude'' charmed the creature so that it would loyally serve the owner of the hood. The hood would instantly grow or shrink to fit the head of the creature. This hood's magic worked on avians as well as other flying creatures such as [[dragon]]s and even the mighty [[Zakharan roc]]s. The hood never failed to charm when used against natural animals, but intelligent creatures did have a chance to resist the hood's magic.
