}}A '''''stone of good luck''''', or '''''luckstone''''', was a small, [[magic]]ally imbued stone that granted its wearer good fortune.

==Description==
''Stones of good luck'' were usually made from polished [[agate]], [[carnelian]], or [[alexandrite]], though other minerals could also be used. If viewed through a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell, a ''stone of good luck'' gave off a faint [[evocation]] aura.

A ''luckstone'' was originally said to appear exactly like a ''[[philosopher's stone]]'' or ''[[loadstone]]''. In fact, discerning a ''philosopher's stone'' from a ''luckstone'' seemed to require some destructive testing: placing a suspect ''stone'' in molten lead would destroy a ''luckstone'', but not a ''philosopher's stone''.{{Cite dragon/2|30}}

==Creation==

They were said to originate in the [[halfling]] country of [[Luiren]], with the "luck of the hin" having rubbed off on the stones.

[[Gold dragon]]s of [[dragon aging|adult]] age and older (meaning older than a century) could give any gem the properties of a ''luckstone'' for 19 hours to 39 hours depending on age. These temporary ''luckstones'' gave their benefits to every good creature within 60–120 ft. (18.3–36.6 m) depending on age, if owned by the dragon but only to the holder if given to another creature.

A [[crystal dragon]] who was very old or older could enchant one of its own scales as if it was a ''stone of good luck'' for 9 to 12 hours according to its age. They gifted these to especially friendly visitors.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Drasna Bluemantle]], king of [[Ulgarth]], owned a ''stone of good luck''. Used in tandem with a ''[[luckblade]]'', the two items earned him the epithet "the Fortunate".
* The [[thief]]/[[cleric]] [[Jak Fleet]] owned a ''luckstone'', which he kept on a chain fastened to his belt.
* The [[illusionist]] [[Myste]] owned a ''[[stone of mixed luck]]'', a type of ''luckstone'' that only bestowed good luck 85% of the time. On the other 15% of occasions it caused disastrously poor luck.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|132|Myste's Stone of Mixed Luck}}
* The [[elf|elven]] [[adventurer]] [[Sylvanus Moondrop]] carried a ''stone of good luck''.
