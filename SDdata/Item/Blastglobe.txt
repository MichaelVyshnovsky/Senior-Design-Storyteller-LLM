'''''Blastglobes''''' were a favored magical tool of the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter|Graycloaks]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]].

==Description==
These devices resembled bronze-hued glass spheres.

==Powers==
When hurled (usually in battle), they released a powerful blast of pure concussive damage. Some ''blastglobes'' instead enclosed objects for delivery to the site, though they did not work for enclosing liquids, gases, or living things, even in ''[[temporal stasis|stasis]]'' fields.

==History==
''Blastglobes'' were manufactured by the mages of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

In {{yearlink|1374}}, the [[Kalach-Cha]] may have found a box of ''blastglobes'', some of which were unstable and thus unsuited for use in battle. The unstable globes may have been used later to clear a rockfall in a mountain; it is possible that he may have been informed about their uses by [[Grobnar Gnomehands]]; to his recall, they had been last used in the far past, against an orcish horde of hundreds.
