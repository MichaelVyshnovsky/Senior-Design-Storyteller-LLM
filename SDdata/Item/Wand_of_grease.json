        "mainbody": "'''''Wands of grease''''' were magic [[wand]]s that stored and unleashed the ''[[grease]]'' [[spell]] on command.",
        "Description": "''Wands of grease'' were utterly mundane in appearance because of the material used in their creation. Each wand resembled a knotted piece of driftwood.",
        "Powers": "Upon an utterance of its [[command word]], a ''wand of grease'' unleashed a single spell stored within. Each wand held a number of charges and disintegrated upon the use of its last spell.",
        "History": "One notable creator of ''wands of grease'' was the [[enchantress]] [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]] of [[Neverwinter]] who took residence in the town of [[Targos]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. She started [[enchanted|enchanting]] ''wands of grease'' to slow and frustrate any creatures and savage species of the [[North]] that occasionally attacked the [[Ten Towns]]."
