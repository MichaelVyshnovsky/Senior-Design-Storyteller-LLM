        "mainbody": "Spiked chains were type of exotic melee weapon.\nSpiked chains were a length of metal chain whose last few links on each end were enlarged and enhanced with spikes. The length and size of these links were usually proportional to the size of their wielder in order to ensure optimal performance. At the half-way point of the chain and/or the midpoints of the two halves, a link of the chain was often replaced with a ring for grasping..\nSpiked chains were similar to the whip in that they were a melee weapon with great range, allowing their wielders to attack foes from as far as  away. They took two hands to wield effectively and could be used to trip an opponent. The spiked chain was especially effective at disarming foes by wrapping around their weapon or weapon arm. It took great skill to wield spiked chains without injuring ones self, thus they were typically considered an exotic weapon.\nEladrin duelists were believed to have been the first race to wield spiked chains.\n* Among devils, spiked chains were a common weapon of both cornugons and kytons. The latter, otherwise known as chain devils, had these chains wrapped tightly around their bodies as a sort of horrific armor.\n* Among the celestial eladrin, the shiradi typically fought with spiked chains.\n* Spiked chains were a common weapon among the standard variety of air archons.\n* Spiked chains were a common weapon among kenku.\n* Spiked chains were a common weapon among all three of the races known as shadar-kai. The shadar-kai that were a race of fey, the shadar-kai that were an offshoot of the Netherese, and the shadar-kai that were an offshoot of elves.\n* Whenever gloom golems chose to use weaponry, they often favored the use of spiked chains."
