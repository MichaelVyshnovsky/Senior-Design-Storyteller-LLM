        "mainbody": "The '''''skull totem''''' was a [[mace]] crafted from the skull of a dead [[Oni mage|oni]] known as the [[Ogre King]]. It was considered to be of great religious significance to the [[goblin]]s who worshiped the Ogre King as a [[demigod]] from within the [[Barrow of the Ogre King]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].",
        "Description": "The head of the mace was fashioned from the large [[humanoid]] skull of the Ogre King, although one of the two horns had been broken off at the base. The skull was covered in elaborate, blood-red tracings. It was set into a long, [[leather]]-wrapped haft that allowed it to be held and wielded as a mace.",
        "Powers": "The mace was a ''[[goblin totem]]'', meaning that merely holding it imbued the wielder with a confidence to face enemies much larger than they were. The weapon itself was also just a bit more dangerous when it struck bigger enemies.",
        "History": "The ''skull totem'' was fashioned by goblin worshipers of the Ogre King sometime after his death in the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]], alongside a [[dagger]] made of the missing horn, known appropriately as the ''[[horn totem]]''. When the goblins' [[shaman|High Shaman]], [[Sancossug]], began plotting to revive the Ogre King in the late 1470s DR, both totems became vital as he wanted the Ogre King's skeleton to be intact for his ritual.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the ''horn totem'' was stolen from the Barrow of the Ogre King by a [[wizard]] from [[Loudwater]] known as [[Curuvar the Brazen]], prompting a violent retaliation by the goblins. Adding insult to injury, Curuvar then sought out [[adventurer]]s to retrieve the ''skull totem'' from its resting place inside the Ogre King's sarcophagus deep within the Barrow."
