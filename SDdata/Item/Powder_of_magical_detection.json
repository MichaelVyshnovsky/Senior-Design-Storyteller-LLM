        "mainbody": "Powder of magical detection was a type of magical powder.\nThis powder was extremely fine and consisted of minute, crystalline granules. They typically came in packets that contained around eleven to twenty pinches of the powder.\nWhenever a mere pinch of this crystalline powder made contact with a magical item, regardless of its size, it would spark and flash with a prismatic array of colors. Users could not discern from the powder the nature or intensity of an items enchantment, only that the item in question was magical.\n* The Diviners Guild of Ravens Bluff was known to sell powder of magic detection for around 4,650 gp in the 14 century DR."
