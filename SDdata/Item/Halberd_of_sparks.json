The  polearm was topped with a clever-like axe head with a barbed tip, useful to exploit gaps in opponents armor.\nHalberds of sparks were enchanted with a +1 enchantment and the ability to deal additional lightning damage to its targets.\nIn 1281 DR, one of the halberds of sparks was located within one of the crypts in the Vale of Shadows on the Spine of the World."
