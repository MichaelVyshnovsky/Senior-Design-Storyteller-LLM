'''Orc double axes''' were a type of [[orc]]ish [[polearm#Poleaxe_Family|poleaxe]].

{{quote|''One blade good, two blades better!''|Orcish wisdom}}

==Description==
This weapon was two double-bladed axes mounted on either end of a stout shaft. There were two wide grips on the haft, about midway between the center and each axe head. The blades were narrower than those on a [[greataxe]] to reduce the weight, which was considerable. The toe of each axe blade could be extended to a sharp point, and the ends of the haft could be spiked also. The average orc double axe weighed around {{SI|15|lbs|k}}.

==Weaponology==
They were not designed to be used as throwing weapons.<ref>
