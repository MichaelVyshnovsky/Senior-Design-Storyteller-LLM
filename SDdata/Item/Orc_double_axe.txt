Orc double axes were a type of orcish poleaxe.
This weapon was two double-bladed axes mounted on either end of a stout shaft. There were two wide grips on the haft, about midway between the center and each axe head. The blades were narrower than those on a greataxe to reduce the weight, which was considerable. The toe of each axe blade could be extended to a sharp point, and the ends of the haft could be spiked also. The average orc double axe weighed around .
They were not designed to be used as throwing weapons.
