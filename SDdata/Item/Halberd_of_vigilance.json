        "Description": "''Halberds of vigilance'' were decorated with the insignia of Myth Drannor's Royal Court.",
        "Powers": "These [[polearm]]s were enspelled with the ''+2'' enchantment that also improved the owner's defense and their initiative. They also dealt additional force damage with each successfully landed strike. The wielder of a ''halberd of vigilance'' also gained improved perception and initiative in battle.",
        "History": "One of these ancient [[elf|elven]] halberds made its way into the [[Halls of Light]] of Myth Drannor's Dwarven Dungeons following the centuries past the[[Weeping War]]. It was believed that a certain variant of a ''halberd of vigilance'' was tossed away because the magic weapon continued to shout distressfully \"ALARM! POTENCY FILLS ME LIKE A SONG OF HOPE!\" In [[1369 DR]], that ''halberd of vigilance'' was wielded by a [[spectre]] against the adventurers from [[Phlan]] known as the [[Veiled Ones]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''halberd of vigilance'' belonged to [[Lann Tarv]], an eloquent [[bugbear]] merchant and a member of the dreaded [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]] of the [[Western Heartlands]]."
