They also dealt additional force damage with each successfully landed strike. The wielder of a halberd of vigilance also gained improved perception and initiative in battle.\nOne of these ancient elven halberds made its way into the Halls of Light of Myth Drannors Dwarven Dungeons following the centuries past theWeeping War. It was believed that a certain variant of a halberd of vigilance was tossed away because the magic weapon continued to shout distressfully \"ALARM! POTENCY FILLS ME LIKE A SONG OF HOPE!\" In 1369 DR, that halberd of vigilance was wielded by a spectre against the adventurers from Phlan known as the Veiled Ones. In the , a halberd of vigilance belonged to Lann Tarv, an eloquent bugbear merchant and a member of the dreaded Cult of the Absolute in the Moonrise Towers of the Western Heartlands."
