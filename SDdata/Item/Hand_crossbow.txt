A '''hand crossbow''' was a smaller version of a [[crossbow]] that could be held in one hand.

==Description==
Hand crossbows could be operated with a single hand. The loaded bolts had a range of purposes, but most often to contain [[drow knockout poison]], especially when wielded by the [[drow]].<ref>. They were easily concealed, and favored by rogues and those who would prefer to use stealth, rather than power.

==History==
[[Cadderly Bonaduce]] owned a special hand crossbow that was crafted by [[Ivan Bouldershoulder|Ivan]] and [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], at the [[Edificant Library]]. The young scholar mainly used this projectile weapon in combination with [[oil of impact]] to deal explosion damage to his enemies. He used the weapon to score his first ever kill on the evil cleric, [[Barjin]].<ref>

[[Dorigen Kel Lamond]] acquired this crossbow while Cadderly's group escaped from [[Ragnor]]'s imprisonment. He feared that she would replicate the weapon, and distribute it to her peers. Later, in [[Shilmista]] forest, the scholar spared Dorigen, but crushed her hands, severely damaging them.<ref> After this, Dorigen had mixed feelings towards Cadderly, and did not distribute the unique weapon. Cadderly kept the weapon with him at most times, and used it in a fight with [[giant toad]] in [[Fyrentennimar]]'s lair. The toad first of all consumed the crossbow's bolt, but some time later, exploded in a giant mess.<ref>
