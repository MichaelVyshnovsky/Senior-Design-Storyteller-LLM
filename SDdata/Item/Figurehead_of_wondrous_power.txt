A figurehead of wondrous power was a magical wood statue that granted beneficial powers to a spelljamming ship.
Each type of figurehead was carved in the shape of a creature, typically humanoid, using a particular type of wood. Each figure was inlaid with one or multiple jewels, depending on the boon it provided.
Each type of figurehead provided different boons, and were constructed from different materials.
* Figurehead of attacks Summoned a warrior that could be controlled in combat by the spelljamming mage.
* Figurehead of disguise Projected illusions on the spelljammer, altering its appearance to onlookers.
* Figurehead of speed Increased the tactical speed of a spelljamming ship, though not during travel.
