        "mainbody": "'''''Exeltis Blade''''' was the famous [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] that belonged to the [[Exeltis]] noble family from the [[Sword Coast North]].",
        "Powers": "The blade possessed a ''+2 enchantment'' with its edge coated in magical [[poison]] that sapped the target's constitution when introduced into their bloodstream.",
        "History": "Couple of decades before [[1372 DR]], the ''Exeltis Blade'' belonged to Lord Exeltis of House Exeltis. On his deathbed, the just and fair nobleman entrusted the dagger to his young son, [[Feldran Exeltis]]. The Lord demanded a promise from his son, to defend his mother, Lady Exeltis, with his life. With years passing, Feldran Exeltis grew up to be a wild and cruel man. One night, the young Lord accompanying his aging mother, Lady Exeltis, on her late nights stroll along the beautiful [[Blade Cliffs]]. Feldran, evidently, forgot the promise he gave his dying father, and used the ''Exeltis Blade'' to cut his mother's life short. Feldran Exeltis became the new owner of [[Castle Exeltis]] following \"accidental\" death of his mother.\n\nThe young noble still carried the ''Exeltis Blade'' as of 1372 DR, when he attempted to kidnap and marry a young \"princess\" [[Soliana]], thinking she was a rich heir to some distant kingdom."
