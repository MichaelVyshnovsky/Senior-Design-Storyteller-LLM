        "mainbody": "Bottles of the healer were enchanted bottles that magically refilled themselves with special curative wine.\nWine created by such bottles was foul-tasting, dry, highly alcoholic, and thin.\nOne bottle produced enough wine to emulate the effects of the cure light wounds spell. The enchantments eventually refilled the bottle once it was emptied. The same magic prohibited a person from carrying more than one bottle of the healer at the time. If a person carried more than one bottle, all the bottles immediately cracked, losing all magic and curative wine inside.\nCirca the , a precious wine box of holding belonged to the maedar winemaker Vorlon who ran the Morden Winery, located in a valley outside the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast. His extradimensional box contained more treasures an enchanted bottle of the healer and a rare crystal bottle of elverquisst bottled in ancient Myth Drannor. The maedar offered the box and its contents to the adventurers who helped him work out the deal between his winery and its rightful owner, Shauna Morden of Ravens Bluff."
