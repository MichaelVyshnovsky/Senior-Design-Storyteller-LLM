A '''cranial drill''' was a surgical tool used to make a hole in a person's skull, or possibly just in wood.

==Use==
It was used to drill a hole in a patient's skull to release cranial pressure and thus alleviate persistent and extreme headaches or madness. This should of course only be performed by a skilled surgeon with a steady hand, or a carpenter in a pinch. This was not without risk: it could deteriorate the patient's mental capacity, do nothing, or even actually relieve the symptoms. And if there was a slip, it could kill the patient, but at least the condition would be cured. While some were understandably dubious of the benefit and safety of this, others swore it was effective, occasionally.

==Availability==
Only one model of cranial drill was sold through [[Aurora's Emporium]] and the [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]. It had a [[gnome]]-crafted ratchet mechanism and a robust [[iron]] construction, and was valued at only 10 [[gp]].

==History==
At [[Bryn Goldtooth]]'s shop in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], ''circa'' [[1367 DR]], there was once offered for sale a variety of cranial drills (used).
