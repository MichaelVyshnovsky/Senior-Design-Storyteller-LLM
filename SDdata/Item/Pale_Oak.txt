'''''Pale Oak''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[staff]] wielded by the most devote members of the [[Church of Silvanus]].

==Powers==
Each of the ''Pale Oak'' staves was imbued with the [[divine]] magics of [[Silvanus]], the Oak Father to be wielded by the [[Faithwarden]]s, the [[Silvanite]] defenders of nature. The staves allowed their wielders to cast the ''[[Faithwarden's vines]]'' [[spell]]. The wielders were also unaffected by the spell and could move freely through the summoned plant growth.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Kagha]] of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] could reward helpers to the Grove's cause with a ''Pale Oak''.
