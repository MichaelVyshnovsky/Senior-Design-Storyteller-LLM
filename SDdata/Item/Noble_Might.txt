Noble Might was a heavily enchanted scepter wielded by Siamorphe, the Divine Right.
Noble Might was forged from the purest adamantine alloy.
The scepter served as a +5 enchanted weapon during combat. Additionally, it possessed all of the combined powers of a Netherese blast scepter, a rod of rulership, and a staff of curing.
