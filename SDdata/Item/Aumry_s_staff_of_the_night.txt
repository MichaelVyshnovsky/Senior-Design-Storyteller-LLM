'''''Aumry's staff of the night''''', also known as '''''Aumry's staff of the hulk''''' was a magical [[staff]] once possessed by [[Aumry]], Lord of [[Shadowdale]] between [[1300 DR]] and [[1339 DR]]. but of very different appearance and make and with its own particular history.As presented in [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting: Shadowdale'' (2nd edition, revised)]], page 7, and in ''[[Shadowdale: The Scouring of the Land]]'', pages 150–151, ''Aumry's staff'' is implied to be a unique item. However, page 112 of the Campaign Guide included in ''[[The Ruins of Myth Drannor]]'' notes it to be an example of a ''staff of night''. Although in 2nd edition the powers of the staff are distinct from those of the ''staff of night'', in 3rd/v.3.5, the powers of the staff are identical to those of the ''staff of night'' in ''[[Magic of Faerûn]]'', page 150, reconfirming the connection.

==Description==
The staff was fashioned from twisted [[iron]] ending in a large claw at the top. This held a [[geode]], which was cut in half to expose the iridescent violet crystals within.

==Powers==
''Aumry's staff'' had all the standard powers of a ''[[staff of night]]''.

Originally, it bestowed both [[infravision]] and [[ultravision]] powers automatically and continually upon grasping the staff. However, after the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], it merely cast the ''[[darkvision]]'', and ''[[low-light vision]]'' spells, for the cost of one charge each.

It also contained the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell but this only worked against [[:Category:Light spells|light spells]], such as ''[[light]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', and ''[[faerie fire]]'', and not against glowing magical auras, while permanent magical lights would eventually reappear. To use this function, the bearer had to touch the staff to the magical light and make a wordless mental command. This would expend one charge.

The ''staff of night'' could conjure an orb of darkness for the cost of one charge. Formerly, similar to ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'' but was only a 20-foot-wide (6 meters) sphere centered on the midpoint of the staff, moving with the staff and thus its wielder. It could be dispelled as normal. After 1372 DR, this was a standard ''[[darkness]]'' spell, 40 feet wide (12 meters) and with greater option in placement.

Most importantly, the staff could be used to summon an [[umber hulk]] to do its wielder's bidding. The umber hulk appeared at full health, obeyed the bearer's will, and fought and served faithfully and obediently, even in the most dangerous tasks (though it would not harm itself).In ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting: Shadowdale'' (2nd edition, revised), under the name "''Aumry's staff of the hulk''", the staff was only stated to summon an umber hulk, with no mention of its other powers. This summoning is much stronger than other descriptions of a ''staff of night'' for the same edition.  In any case, when used, the geode at the staff's top glowed and fired a scintillating purple beam into the ground, from which light the umber hulk appeared.

Finally, the wielder was granted immunity against any umber hulk's confusing gaze.

==History==
It isn't known if Aumry acquired this staff somehow or created it himself, but it came to carry his name nonetheless. It was perhaps the most unique and the strangest of the many magical items he owned. ''Aumry's staff'' served him well for many years.

After Aumry was murdered by [[Jyordhan|Jyordhan the False]] in the [[1339 DR|Year of the Weeping Moon, 1339 DR]], his wife [[Syluné]] buried him in [[Aumry’s Tomb|a tomb]] under [[Watcher's Knoll]], with his staff laid beside him.

It didn't sit there long, however, for Aumry's tomb was secretly robbed by [[Lashan Aumersair]] in the [[1344 DR|Year of the Moonfall, 1344 DR]], and ''Aumry's staff'' was stolen. He held it for twelve years, but it became lost amidst his failed conquest of the [[Dalelands]]. Its whereabouts remained unknown, but it was believed possible it was still in Lashan's possession, rumored to still be alive and in hiding.

In fact, Lashan stashed ''Aumry's staff'' somewhere unknown. Eventually, after many years, Lashan, now a [[daemon]]ic spirit in the power of the goddess [[Shar]], led her priestess [[Esvele Graycastle]] to where he'd hidden ''Aumry's staff''.

Finally, on [[Nightal 15]] or shortly before, in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Esvele Graycastle entered Aumry's Tomb and returned ''Aumry's staff'' to his coffin. This was not done in respect, but rather to put the spirit of Syluné, now the Ghost Witch and protector of Shadowdale, to rest. This not done in kindness either, but to leave the dale undefended to the forces of [[Zhentil Keep]]. Thereafter, ''Aumry's staff'' lay in his coffin, but may have been retrieved by adventurers thwarting Evele and the Zhents in the winter of the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]].
