Beehives were enclosed, artificial structures designed for honey-producing bees to live in.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold beehives shaped like large eggs, with interior sections of nesting eggs circumscribed around their center. This design allowed the tops of their beehives to be removed quickly.
* In Zhentil Keep, the store Litas Equipment sold similar beehives to those of Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 12 gold pieces.
