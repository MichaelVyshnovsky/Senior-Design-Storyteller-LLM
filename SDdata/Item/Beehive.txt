'''Beehives''' were enclosed, artificial structures designed for [[honey]]-producing [[bee]]s to live in.

|How fitting that the sweetest of nectars comes from insects with the most savage sting. But only [[bear]]s wage war on natural hivesâ€”intelligent races raise bees like they do [[cattle]].

* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold beehives shaped like large [[egg]]s, with interior sections of nesting eggs circumscribed around their center. This design allowed the tops of their beehives to be removed quickly.
* In [[Zhentil Keep]], the store [[Lita's Equipment]] sold similar beehives to those of ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' for 12 [[gold piece]]s.<ref>
