Sembian Swill was a type of a distilled alcoholic drink found in the city of Westgate and the nation of Sembia.
This concoction was distilled from furbid plants root. It was dark in color and bitter to taste. Tavernkeepers often claimed that Sembian Swill was created with a single purposeâ€”to topple a horse with a single gulp of the drink.
By the late 14 century DR, Sembian Swill was served in many of Westgates inns and bard, including The Track, the underground racing rink, and gambling establishment on the Market Triangle.
