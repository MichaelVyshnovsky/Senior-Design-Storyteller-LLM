Heat mats were items in the Realms often used by wizards to absorb heat during experiments.
Common heat mats were quilted in Sembia while a stronger version was made from a white crystalline substance found in the Orsraun Mountains.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 5 copper pieces for the quilted variety and 5 gold pieces for the crystalline variety.
* Heat mats were favored by wizards.
