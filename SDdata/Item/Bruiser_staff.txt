'''''Bruiser staves''''' were [[enchanted]] [[staves]] of powerful physical might.

==Description==
''Bruiser staves'' were simple-looking wooden masterwork [[quarterstaves]] from {{SI|6'|'"|long=yes}} to {{SI|9'|'"|long=yes}} long. They were sometimes carved out of stout [[oak]].

==Powers==
''Bruiser staves'' possessed a ''+5'' enchantment that effortlessly guided the wielder's weapon towards their targets and could damage even creatures who usually were unaffected by weapons of lesser enchantments. This magic, however, granted a limited boost to the staff's damage output. Despite that, the bruising enchantment wounded each successful strike's targets, causing bleeding. It also had a chance of stunning the targets.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a ''bruiser staff'' belonged to the Archmage of the Underdark city of [[Rilauven]], [[Malavon Despana]], who operated from the caverns underneath the [[Spine of the World]].
