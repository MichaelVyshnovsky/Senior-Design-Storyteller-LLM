A '''''phylactery of faithfulness''''' was a useful item for [[divine magic|divine spellcaster]]s, in that it enabled the wearer to foresee how their actions would affect their connection to their [[deity]].

==Description==
A ''phylactery of faithfulness'' took the form of a small box holding religious scripture. It was tied around the forehead by a leather cord attached to the box. There was no non-magical way to determine precisely what it did until it was worn.

==Creation==
To create a ''phylactery of faithfulness'', the creator must cast ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect law]]'', and ''[[detect chaos]]'' during the process.

==Activation==
If the wearer of a ''phylactery of faithfulness'' considered an intended action or use of an item beforehand, then they were alerted if that action or item would have a negative impact on their relationship with their deity or on their [[alignment]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Haroistem]], a priest of [[Lathander]]. Granted by the god himself, it also provided him with continuous ''[[augury]]''.<ref name=TC-561>{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|561|Haroistem}}
* [[Shahpesh]], a [[Zakhara]]n [[moralist]]{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|375|Shahpesh}}

A ''phylactery of faithfulness'' was hidden in the King's Tower of [[Uthtower]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/73/Eye of Myrkul|42}}
