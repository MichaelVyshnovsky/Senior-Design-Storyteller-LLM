A phylactery of faithfulness was a useful item for divine spellcasters, in that it enabled the wearer to foresee how their actions would affect their connection to their deity.
A phylactery of faithfulness took the form of a small box holding religious scripture. It was tied around the forehead by a leather cord attached to the box. There was no non-magical way to determine precisely what it did until it was worn.
To create a phylactery of faithfulness, the creator must cast detect evil, detect good, detect law, and detect chaos during the process.
If the wearer of a phylactery of faithfulness considered an intended action or use of an item beforehand, then they were alerted if that action or item would have a negative impact on their relationship with their deity or on their alignment.
