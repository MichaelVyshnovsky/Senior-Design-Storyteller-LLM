Skilled physicians were able to make even greater uses of such kits, restoring the fallen so that they could fight again, and restoring their health even if they had not fallen.\n* In Athkatla, one could find healers bags for sale in the market Waukeens Promenade.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* In Zhentil Keep, one could find healers bags for sale at Litas Equipment.Ruins of Zhentil Keep states that everything from the Arms and Equipment Guide, except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Litas Equipment.\nThese kits were used in many places throughout Faer√ªn, even in Undermountain."
