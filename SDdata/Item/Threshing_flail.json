        "mainbody": "Threshing flails, also known as grain flails or simply flails, were a type of agricultural tool used to thresh grain, such as barley and wheat, as well as other grassy crops.\nThreshing flails consisted of long handles with a free swinging block of wood at their end that was typically  in length. These were connected together by either leather straps or rope. These connective materials were typically  in length. Alternatively, some threshing flails had their handle and wooden block connected by a mere swivel.\nThough they were originally designed to be an agricultural tool, threshing flails could make effective bludgeoning weapons. They were even classified as a \"special case\" type of polearm.\nSince the earliest days of warfare, farmers that were recruited to fight would often utilize threshing flails as a sort of bludgeoning weapon. Over time armorers and other weaponmakers would develop variations intended solely for the purposes of warfare. One was the horsemans flail, which used sturdy chains and weights made of iron or wood that were covered in short spikes.\nOn Toril, this started to occur sometime before , when military flails first became available in the Netherese Empire.\nThreshing flails were a common instrument on almost any farm. and the farming slaves of Thay.\nThis tool was the namesake for the Threshing Flail, a tavern in the city of Purskul."
