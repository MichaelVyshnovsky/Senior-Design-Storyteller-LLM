        "mainbody": "'''Threshing flails''', also known as '''grain flails''' or simply '''flails''', were a type of agricultural tool used to thresh grain, such as [[barley]] and [[wheat]], as well as other grassy crops.",
        "Description": "Threshing flails consisted of long handles with a free swinging block of wood at their end that was typically {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length. These were connected together by either leather straps or [[rope]]. These connective materials were typically {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} in length. Alternatively, some threshing flails had their handle and wooden block connected by a mere swivel.",
        "Weaponlogy": "Though they were originally designed to be an agricultural tool, threshing flails could make effective bludgeoning weapons. They were even classified as a \"special case\" type of [[polearm]].",
        "History": "Since the earliest days of warfare, farmers that were recruited to fight would often utilize threshing flails as a sort of bludgeoning weapon. Over time armorers and other weaponmakers would develop variations intended solely for the purposes of warfare. One was the [[horseman's flail]], which used sturdy chains and weights made of [[iron]] or wood that were covered in short spikes.\n\nOn [[Toril]], this started to occur sometime before {{YearlinkConvert|1265|NY}}, when military flails first became available in the [[Netheril|Netherese Empire]].",
        "Notable Users": "Threshing flails were a common instrument on almost any farm. and the farming slaves of [[Thay]].",
        "Trivia": "This tool was the namesake for the [[Threshing Flail (tavern)|Threshing Flail]], a tavern in the city of [[Purskul]].<ref>{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}"
