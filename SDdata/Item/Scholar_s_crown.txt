'''''Scholar's crowns''''' were [[enchanted]] circlets used in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These metal circlets shimmered and vibrated with a perpetual subdued hum. When worn, they somewhat invigorated and energized the wearer.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''scholar's crowns'' were in wide use across the [[Sword Coast North]] area, namely the [[Sword Mountains]], the city of [[Neverwinter]] and its markets, and among [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s of the [[Neverwinter Wood]].
