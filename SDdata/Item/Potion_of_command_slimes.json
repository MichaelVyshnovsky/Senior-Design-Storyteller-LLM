The active duration of this effect was around 10 to 40 minutes.\"Molds\" in this case most likely refers to the monstrous molds of the time &ndash; [[brown mold]]s, [[russet mold]]s, and [[yellow mold]]s.",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[Ravenian]] [[adventurer]]s were gifted a ''potion of command slimes'' and six [[gemstone]]s worth 400 [[gold piece]]s by the retired adventuring [[bard]] [[Luff]] as an award for breaking the [[curse]] that had been placed upon his [[lyre]]{{Cite organized play/LC/The Voice of a Lyre|2}}"
