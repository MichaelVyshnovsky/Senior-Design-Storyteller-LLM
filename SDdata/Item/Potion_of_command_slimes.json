        "mainbody": "Potions of command slimes, also referred to as potions of slime control, were a form of potion that afforded imbibers some degree of control over various forms of oozes.\nThe effect of a potion of command slimes was comparable to the spell command plants when cast by a wizard of the 8 degree, but applied to puddings, slimes, and molds instead of vegetation. The active duration of this effect was around 10 to 40 minutes.\"Molds\" in this case most likely refers to the monstrous molds of the time &ndash brown molds, russet molds, and yellow molds.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of Ravenian adventurers were gifted a potion of command slimes and six gemstones worth 400 gold pieces by the retired adventuring bard Luff as an award for breaking the curse that had been placed upon his lyre"
