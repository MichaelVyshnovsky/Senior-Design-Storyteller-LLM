        "mainbody": "Mead was a slightly sweet alcoholic beverage made of fermented honey. It was commonly brewed in the Northlands. Mead from the gardens of Neverwinter was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nMead was considerably rarer and more difficult to produce than wine, due to its slow fermentation and its sensitivity to temperature and the amount of yeast. When successfully brewed, it resulted in a delicate and sweet beverage.\n*Conyberry mead was exported from the town of Conyberry on the edge of the Neverwinter Wood by Tarmalune Trade House in Neverwinter.\n* The settlement of Good Mead produced a sweet mead that was available in other locations of Ten Towns such as Bryn Shander.\n* Malefic Mead, dangerous alcoholic drink found in the Abyssal city of Samora.\n* Mead that was fermented from the honeybees living in the gardens of Neverwinter was considered by many to be the finest quality found in the North.\n* Sparkling Evermead - a type of sparking mead that was often served at parties.\n* Mead made from the honey of the flowers of Mount Celestia was rumored to enhance ones life span, but the exceptionally potent beverage was, of course, somewhat hard to obtain for mere mortals.\n* Mead produced by the inhabitants of Arvandor was famous for its high quality and was always sought out by travelers.\n* In the late 15 century DR, the city of Luskan began exporting regular mead as \"Luskan Ice Mead\" in order to sell it at a higher price in lands to the south."
