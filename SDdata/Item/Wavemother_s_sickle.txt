'''''Wavemother's sickle''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Umberlant]] [[sickle]] found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Wavemother's sickle'' had a gentle shape that resembled a pitiless crescent moon overlooking a storming sea. The weapon itself resembled an item shaped out of [[coral]] or possibly of driftwood. It possessed a ''+2'' enchantment to the damage it dealt and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Each slash with the sickle could leave bleeding lacerations and harm the targets with magical frost. Additionally, ''Wavemother's sickle'' possessed a ''watery guidance'' that made all attacks with the cycled highly advantageous against wet targets.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Wavemother's sickle'' was wielded by Flood Tide [[Allandra Grey]] of the [[Water Queen's House]] in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate.
