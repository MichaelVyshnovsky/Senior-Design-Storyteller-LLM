        "mainbody": "An amulet of leadership was a magic brooch or pendant that enhanced the ability of the wearer to attract followers to command.\nWhen a warrior approached a wearer of this amulet, the stranger perceived a person of great reknown and/or potential. The longer the amulet was worn, the longer the good reputation of the wearer would spread. If the amulet were ever taken off, all followers attracted by its magic would immediately lose faith in their leader and would likely depart over time. Such a sullying of the former leaders reputation could then never be repaired by wearing the amulet again, though reputaion could be regained by mundane means.\nAt least one of the warriors who fought with the Moonlight Men against the orcs of the Nethertide Horde in the Battle of Turnstone Pass wore one of these amulets. It was buried with the warrior in the Cairn of Moonlight in Turnstone Pass."
