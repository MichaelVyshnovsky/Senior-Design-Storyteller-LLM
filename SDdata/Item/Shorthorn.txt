A shorthorn was an instrument of the longhorn family that was capable of reaching very high notes.
Shorthorns had limited range due to their size, but they were capable of reaching very loud and clear notes with a piercing birdlike sound.
They were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
