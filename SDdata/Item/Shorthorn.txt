A '''shorthorn''' was an instrument of the [[longhorn]] family that was capable of reaching very high notes.

==Description==
Shorthorns had limited range due to their size, but they were capable of reaching very loud and clear notes with a piercing birdlike sound.

They were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
