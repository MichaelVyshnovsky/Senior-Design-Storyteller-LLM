The '''''Chronicle of Years to Come''''' was a book in four volumes{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}} written by [[Maglas]] prior to 902 DR<ref group="note">Since the Cult of the Dragon created its first dracolich in 902 DR, the publication of the book must have preceded this date. which contained cryptic prophecies and was translated by [[Sammaster]].

Sammaster interpreted these prophecies to predict that Faerûn would eventually be ruled by undead dragons, and formed the [[Cult of the Dragon]], with the aspiration of creating [[dracolich]]es for this purpose. It also led to his writing the ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]''.
