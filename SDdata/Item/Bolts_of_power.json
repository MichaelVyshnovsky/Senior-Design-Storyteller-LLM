        "Description": "The ''bolts of power'' were identical in their look despite having different powers. They could be either thrown like a dart or launched from a [[hand crossbow]].",
        "Powers": {
            "''Dart of Blinding''": "The ''dart of blinding'' blinded those hit by it with light for two to eight minutes as well as those within 10 ft (3 m) of the target for one to four minutes.",
            "''Dart of Screaming''": "The ''dart of screaming'' gave off a loud sound for nine minutes. This sound fulfilled three purposes. First, it was so loud that it made tracking and locating the target very easy. Second, its loudness allowed it work as an alarm. Third, the sound interfered with potential spellcasting the target wanted to undertake. The ''dart of screaming'' was one of those ''bolts of power'' that did not lose its magical property on missing the target. They could be retrieved and used again.",
            "''Dart of Silencing''": "The ''dart of silencing'' caused a ''[[silence]]'' effect on the hit target and 5 ft (1.5 m) around it for seven to twelve minutes. Removing the darts did not end or move the effect, as the magic was already expended from the dart. The ''dart of silencing'' was one of those ''bolts of power'' that did not lose its magical property on missing the target. They could be retrieved and used again.",
            "''Dart of Stunning''": "The ''dart of stunning'' stunned the hit creature for two to eight minutes and those within 10 ft (3 m) of the hit creature for one to four minutes.",
            "''Dart of Vapors''": "The ''dart of vapors'' was the only ''bolt of power'' that worked without hitting a creature. On impact, the ''dart of vapors'' created a cloud that worked like a ''[[stinking cloud]]'', filling a cubic volume 20 ft (6 m) wide.",
            "''Spider Dart''": "The ''spider dart'' poisoned those hit by it and then turned into a [[giant spider]] that was under nobody's control and did whatever it wanted."
        },
        "History": "The ''bolts of power'' were [[magic item]]s associated with the drow."
