        "Trivia": "Drums were considered a popular instrument among a wide variety of races and cultures. Especially [[dwarves]], [[orc]]s, and other creatures that dwelled underground. For smaller races, such as [[goblin]]s and [[halfling]]s, bongos were typically the preferred form of drum due to their portability. [[Celestial]]s and [[elves]] however, generally felt distaste towards drums."
