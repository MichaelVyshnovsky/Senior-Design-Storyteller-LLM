A sausage was a collection of seasoned minced meat, fat, and/or offal that had been packed into a stadium-shaped container, such as a pigs bladder. They were sold in Faer没n and in the Underdark.

Sausages were made and sold all over Faer没n, particularly in Berdusk, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Dessarin Valley, Kh么ltar, Longsaddle, Myrinjar, Silverymoon, the Sword Coast North, Tethyr, Sembia, and Waterdeep. They were also popular elements of dwarven and halfling cuisine.
Sausages from the Western Heartlands were stuffed with copious amounts of garlic and cooked in mulled wine. Rabbit sausages were common in Rashemen. In the Sword Coast North, boar sausage was made using every piece of the animals meat save for the trotters and tail cuts.
Sausage stalls were common sight during the Festival of Blades in Colletro of the Blade Kingdoms. In Cormyr, sausages were sold sold as street food in places like Arabel, and slices of cold sausage were sometimes served as handfood at taverns alongside grapes, biscuits, and cheeses.
Circa , it was discovered that Barnall Ostever of Longsaddle had been including orc and goblin meat in his sausages, leading to a legacy of dark jokes and refusal to buy any sausage from him in the years after the scandal. As of the late 15 century DR, it was said that the sausages made by the Ostever family had greatly improved, though customers were warned to "mind the tusks".
