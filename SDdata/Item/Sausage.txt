A '''sausage''' was a collection of seasoned minced meat, fat, and/or offal that had been packed into a stadium-shaped container, such as a [[pig]]'s bladder. They were sold in [[Faerûn]] and in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
[[File:Spicy sausage links.png|thumb|''Spiced sausage links from [[Baldur's Gate]].'']]
Sausages were made and sold all over Faerûn, particularly in [[Berdusk]], [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], the [[Dessarin Valley]], [[Khôltar]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}} [[Longsaddle]], [[Myrinjar]],{{Cite polyhedron/135/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}} [[Silverymoon]], the [[Sword Coast North]],{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}} [[Tethyr]],{{Cite polyhedron/44/The Living City: Open Air Farmers Market|23}}{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|15}} [[Sembia]], and [[Waterdeep]]. They were also popular elements of [[dwarf|dwarven]] and [[halfling]] cuisine.

Sausages from the [[Western Heartlands]] were stuffed with copious amounts of [[garlic]] and cooked in [[mulled wine]]. [[Rabbit]] sausages were common in [[Rashemen]]. In the Sword Coast North, [[boar]] sausage was made using every piece of the animals' meat save for the trotters and tail cuts.

Sausage stalls were common sight during the [[Festival of Blades]] in [[Colletro]] of the [[Blade Kingdoms]]. In Cormyr, sausages were sold sold as street food in places like [[Arabel]], and slices of cold sausage were sometimes served as handfood at taverns alongside [[grape]]s, [[biscuit]]s, and [[cheese]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
''Circa'' {{Yearlink|1360}}, it was discovered that [[Barnall Ostever]] of Longsaddle had been including [[orc]] and [[goblin]] meat in his sausages, leading to a legacy of dark jokes and refusal to buy any sausage from him in the years after the scandal. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was said that the sausages made by the [[Ostever]] family had greatly improved, though customers were warned to "mind the tusks".
