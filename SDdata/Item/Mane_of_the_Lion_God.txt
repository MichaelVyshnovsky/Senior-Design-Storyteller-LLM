Mane of the Lion-God was a type of enchanted cloak created and worn by the followers of Nobanion, the titular Lion God of the Gulthmere Forest.
These Nobanionite cloaks were imbued with the Lord Firemanes divine magics increasing the wearers defense when fighting creatures venerating chaos. Additionally, the wearer became unaffected by normal and magical fear.
Manes of the Lion-God were worn with great pride by the druids of Nobanion who warred against lycanthrope servants of Malar, Nobanions enemy. These clocks served as reminders that there was order even in nature. As of the , Nobanionite religion started spreading outside the Gulthmere Forest, along with the church, Manes of the Lion-God started appearing in regions other than the Vilhon Reach. One such cloak was being sold by a druid merchant who did business on the Market Triangle in Westgate.
