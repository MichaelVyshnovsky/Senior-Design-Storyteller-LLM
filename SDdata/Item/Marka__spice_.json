        "mainbody": "Marka was a type of spice unique to Murghôm and Semphar.\nMarka was maroon in color, becoming almost black when wetted, and imparted a \"fried meat\" taste to the foods seasoned with it.\nMarka was created by grinding up the branches of a certain thorn bush, which grew mainly in the foothills of Murghôm and Semphar.\nBetween 1356 DR and 1374 DR, the Highmoon Trading Coster was one of the only mercantile companies known to trade marka across the Sword Coast.\n* Marka was often used to flavor bean stews, vegetable soups, and other bland fare."
