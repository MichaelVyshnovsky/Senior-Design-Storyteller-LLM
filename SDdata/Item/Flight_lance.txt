'''Flight lances''' were a variety of [[lance]] found in the Realms.

==Description==
These lances were made of tough wood, had sharp stone heads, and fletched ends. They typically measured {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Weaponology==
Flight lances were typically used in aerial charges, hurled like a [[javelin]] at the bottom of swoop maneuvers to impale a target. They could also be used in close-quarters, much like a [[shortspear]].

==Notable Flight Lances==

These carried a ''+2'' enchantment, the ''[[shock]]'' [[weapon quality]], and allowed their wielder to cast ''[[feather fall]]'' upon themselves once per day. On the open market they typically cost around 21,510 [[gp]].<ref>
