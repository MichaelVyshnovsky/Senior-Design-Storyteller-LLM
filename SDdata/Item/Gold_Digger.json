        "Powers": "The ''Gold Digger'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and dealt magical damage greater than that of similar weapons. Each successful hit, however, consumed ten [[gold]] [[coin]]s from the wielder's pouch. When the sword's owner ran out of gold, the weapons acted as a simple mundane greatsword.",
        "History": "The ''Gold Digger'' was forged and enchanted in [[Amn]] by dwarves who served the Church of Waukeen. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the ''Gold Digger'' fell into the hands of [[Lucky Aello]], the merchant of [[Baldur's Gate]] who ran [[Lucky Aello's Discount Store]] located by the city gate leading to the [[Wyrm's Crossing]]."
