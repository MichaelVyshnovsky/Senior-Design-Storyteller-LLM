        "mainbody": "A '''tent''' was a simple portable shelter designed for outdoor and wild environments.",
        "Description": "Typical tents were made of canvas held standing by wooden poles and hempen [[rope]] that could be disassembled and packed during travels. Most tents could hold two occupants, but there were larger varieties.\n\nTwo-person and six-person tents were available for purchase through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']]. \n\nThe largest type of tent was known as a ''pavilion''. They were  large, open-air canopies that could comfortably fit around twenty medium-sized [[humanoid]]s.",
        "History": "In [[1368 DR]], [[gnoll]] soldiers of the [[Thayan]] army were living in tents outside the barracks of the village [[Whitebranch]].\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], soon after [[gold]] was discovered in the village of [[Deadsnows]] many traveled from afar in hopes of striking it rich and set up a collection of tents outside its walls. During this, a [[half-orc]] named [[Vandar]] ran an impromptu tavern from a tent.",
        "Varieties": "* '''Khreima:''' a conical tent with a triangular floor plan that was unique to the nomadic Bedine tribes of Anauroch. They were typically woven from the thick hairs of [[camel]]s and dyed by means of [[henna]], rubbed [[coffee]]-grounds, or other rubbed juices. Occasionally they were decorated with patterns or tribal symbols. A khreima was typically held up by wooden poles in each of its three corners, that were connected to a triangle of ceiling-poles and a triangle of floor-poles that hooked or pegged into the tent's carpet. These poles often featured hooks, upon which garments or weapons would be hung. Occasionally [[blanket]]s or garments were hung from the ceiling-poles to create \"walls\" within a tent. The leaders of a tribe lived within pavillion-sized versions of these tents.\n\n* [[Yurt]]: A dome-like tent that was common among tribes in the [[Hordelands]] and the majority of peasants in [[Tabot]].",
        "Notable Tents": "* ''[[Tulrun's Tent]]'', a [[magical item|magical]] silk tent that belonged to the [[archmage]] [[Tulrun]].\n* ''[[Udlara's tent]]'', a magical tent that belonged to the [[camel]] breeder [[Udlara Thaerintauhn]].{{Cite Polyhedron UK/1/Just Deserts|13}}",
        "Notable Users": {
            "Groups": "* In the [[Unapproachable East]], tents were often prominent in the markets of towns and cities, such as [[Bezantur]] and [[Mulptan]]."
