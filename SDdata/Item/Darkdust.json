        "mainbody": "Darkdust was a variety of enchanted powder that could impede a foes vision\nThis powder resembled coarse sand and was gray in coloration. It was typically contained within small black bags or pouches, with enough of the substance for one to three doses.\nDarkdust could only affect creatures that were living humanoids of  in height. When thrown at such a target, the creature would be completely enveloped in a cloud of inky blackness. If the powders magic was resisted, the target would only be afflicted with temporary blindness.\nThe effect of darkdust could be negated by the cure blindness spell.\nMost guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more pouches of darkdust."
