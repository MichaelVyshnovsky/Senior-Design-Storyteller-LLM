XYZ balm was an alchemical balm sold by hedge wizards.
It was a general purpose ointment used to cure burns, scrapes, and poisons such as poison ivy. It wasnt magical and couldnt heal those outright, instead speeding up the bodys recovery.
Despite being nonmagical, it still required water that had passed down a unicorns horn for its synthesis. Hedge wizards often traded in it.
It was popular with thieves.
