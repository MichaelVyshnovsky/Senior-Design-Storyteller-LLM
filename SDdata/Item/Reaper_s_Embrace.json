        "mainbody": "The '''''Reaper's Embrace''''' was a suit of [[magic]]al [[plate mail]] armor associated with the [[Myrkulyte]] faith. It was famously worn by General [[Ketheric Thorm]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The armor was quite beautifully crafted, with adornments that evoked both skeletal forms and symbology of [[Myrkul]] himself. The breastplate was crafted to resemble the bones of a ribcage, featuring an open maw gorget with thorn-like teeth that threatened to swallow the wearer whole. The pauldrons of the ''Reaper's Embrace'' were decorated with detached, decrepit hands grasping onto golden skulls. Likenesses of other skulls, skeletons, and numerous iterations of Myrkul's [[holy symbol]] were engraved across several pieces of the armor.\n\nThe center of the armor's breastplate held a golden adornment, within which Ketheric Thorm set his ''[[netherstone]]''.\n\nKetheric preferred to wear a [[chainmail|chain shirt]] and elaborately embroidered gambeson were worn underneath the armor.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Ketheric_Thorm_Reaper's_Embrace.png|thumb|right|300px|''Come on baby, embrace the reaper.'']]\nThe wearer of the armor could incite the ''reaper's rigidity'', a supernatural state that prevented from being moved or knocked over against their will. Unfortunately, this power also prevented the wearer from moving with any real grace or agility.\n\nOne or more times per day the wearer of ''Reaper's Embrace'' could let out a ''howl of the dead''. This inflicted numbness in the extremities of any creatures within a {{SI|10|ft}} radius.",
        "History": "Ketheric remained in possession of the armor as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, following his second conversion, fromt the [[Sharran]] to the Myrkulyte faith."
