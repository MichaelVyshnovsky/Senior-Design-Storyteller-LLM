        "mainbody": "The Reapers Embrace was a suit of magical plate mail armor associated with the Myrkulyte faith. It was famously worn by General Ketheric Thorm during the Absolute crisis of the late 15 century DR.\nThe armor was quite beautifully crafted, with adornments that evoked both skeletal forms and symbology of Myrkul himself. The breastplate was crafted to resemble the bones of a ribcage, featuring an open maw gorget with thorn-like teeth that threatened to swallow the wearer whole. The pauldrons of the Reapers Embrace were decorated with detached, decrepit hands grasping onto golden skulls. Likenesses of other skulls, skeletons, and numerous iterations of Myrkuls holy symbol were engraved across several pieces of the armor.\nThe center of the armors breastplate held a golden adornment, within which Ketheric Thorm set his netherstone.\nKetheric preferred to wear a chain shirt and elaborately embroidered gambeson were worn underneath the armor.\nthumb|right|300px|Come on baby, embrace the reaper.\nThe wearer of the armor could incite the reapers rigidity, a supernatural state that prevented from being moved or knocked over against their will. Unfortunately, this power also prevented the wearer from moving with any real grace or agility.\nOne or more times per day the wearer of Reapers Embrace could let out a howl of the dead. This inflicted numbness in the extremities of any creatures within a  radius.\nKetheric remained in possession of the armor as of the , following his second conversion, fromt the Sharran to the Myrkulyte faith."
