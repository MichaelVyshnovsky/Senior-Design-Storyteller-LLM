Nosfiraats Blade was a golden-hued magical scimitar that originated from Zakhara.
Nosfiraats Blade bore a +1 magical enchantment and critical strikes landed with this blade were especially powerful.
Nosfiraats Blade was one of the golden scimitars that belonged to the famous merchant Daavid Ali Fazeer circa 1322 DR. Daavid claimed the swords were found aboard a ghost ship that was sunken shortly after the merchants excursion onto the vessel. Interestingly enough, Daavid Ali Fazeer refused to say whether the ships crew became ghosts before or after his involvement.
In 1372 DR the bale was in the possession of its namesake, the Zakharan vampire Nosfiraat.
