        "mainbody": "andglyphs were magic items created and used specifically by the Geomancers of Kadar.\nHandglyphs were active or offensive talismans imbued with various magics that would only function when displayed while the correct command word was spoken. The magic typically used in conjunction with handglyphs made them a favorite weapon of Geomancers.\nMost handglyphs were fashioned as circular medallions measuring several inches in diameter. A rba  rune would adorn the front side of the handglyph and the wheel-shaped asfr, the symbol of the Geomancers, would adorn the back side. A chain could be attached to the handglyph if the Geomancer wished to wear it as a necklace. A ward-stone was a variant of a handglyph that was incorporated into other items such as armor, shields, helmets, and the pommels of weapons.\nKnown handglyphs included the amulet of terror, the handglyph of the monolith, the stunglyph, the talisman of force, the talisman of divining, and various handglyphs of power focused on the offensive power of the different elements."
