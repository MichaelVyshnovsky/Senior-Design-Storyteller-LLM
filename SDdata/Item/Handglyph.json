        "mainbody": "'''''Handglyphs''''' were [[magic item]]s created and used specifically by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]].",
        "Powers": "''Handglyphs'' were active or offensive [[talisman]]s imbued with various magics that would only function when displayed while the correct [[command word]] was spoken. The magic typically used in conjunction with ''handglyphs'' made them a favorite weapon of Geomancers.",
        "Description": "Most ''handglyphs'' were fashioned as circular medallions measuring several inches in diameter. A ''rba' '' rune would adorn the front side of the ''handglyph'' and the wheel-shaped ''asfr'', the symbol of the Geomancers, would adorn the back side. A chain could be attached to the ''handglyph'' if the Geomancer wished to wear it as a necklace. A ward-stone was a variant of a ''handglyph'' that was incorporated into other items such as armor, shields, helmets, and the pommels of weapons.",
        "History": "Known ''handglyphs'' included the ''[[amulet of terror]]'', the ''[[handglyph of the monolith]]'', the ''[[stunglyph]]'', the ''[[talisman of force]]'', the ''[[talisman of divining]]'', and various ''[[handglyph of power|handglyphs of power]]'' focused on the offensive power of the different elements."
