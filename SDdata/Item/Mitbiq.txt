The '''''mitbiq''''' ({{Pronounce|miht|BEEK}}) was an interesting [[Zakhara]]n wind instrument that appeared to be two instruments in one.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
''Mitbiqs'' were double clarinets made from reed tubes. Each of the clarinet tubes was complimented by a smaller tube that vibrated to create sound.

==History==
A ''mitbiq'' required a great deal of practice to master because it involved inhaling on one clarinet and then exhaling on the other, allowing for continuous tone production.
