        "mainbody": "Knucklebones was a simple game played by many around Toril.Knucklebones of course were also objects that were part of skeletons and could be used in place of dice. This article specifically only refers to the game known as \"knucklebones\".\nThis game could be played with numerous objects, often knuckles of some variety. Some varieties of knuckles included those of dwarves.\nMany different types of beings enjoyed playing knucklebones, though it was particularly common with gamblers, Not only humans and other common races played such games, but also others, such as firenewts, and ogres.\nIn some situations, such games were rigged, in order to cheat and potentially gain a large amount of coin.\nThough knucklebones was known around Faer√ªn and beyond, it was particularly famous for one specific tale. This tale involved the god Jergal and three incredibly ambitious men Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. The three mortals wished to assume Jergals throne, and as he had grown tired of his rule, he accepted. However, they could not determine who among them would rule. Thus, Jergal proposed a game of skull bowling, where each of them would take the skulls of Jergals most powerful liches, and roll them across the Gray Waste. When Malar interrupted their game of skull bowling, Jergal instead proposed to play knucklebones. The three accepted. Whoever won would choose one out of three of Jergals portfolios. Whoever came second would choose next, and whoever was last would take the remaining one.\nThe game began as Jergal broke off his bones and handed them to the three mortals. When the game ended, the winner was declared to be Bane, followed by Myrkul, and in last place was Bhaal. Bane chose the portfolio of tyranny, whilst Myrkul chose the dead, and Bhaal chose murder. When Malar returned, he found that the game of knucklebones was already over, and alas, only the beasts were left for him.\nWhen Kelemvor claimed the position of Lord Death from Cyric, he recalled the ancient tale of how Myrkul had once won the position via a game of knucklebones. It made him realize that if he did not carry out his duties as a deity, he could be very easily replaced."
