An ulu knife, or simply ulu, was a variety of knife and a versatile tool used in Icewind Dale.
An ulu was a small blade sized to be used with one hand. It had a handle in the center, sometimes made of scrimshaw, with a blade affixed to it in a half-moon shape. The knife was used by rocking it back and forth, easily cutting through whatever it was used on.
As of the late 1480s DR, ulu knives were commonly used across the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, and were often considered to be useful trinkets.
