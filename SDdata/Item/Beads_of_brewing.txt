Beads of brewing were enchanted pellets created to enhance the quality and longevity of any brewed alcoholic drinks.
Beads of brewing showed no signs of possessing any magic and could easily be confused with mundane beads.
To utilize the magic within the beads of brewing, one had to simply drop one or two pellets into a vat during the brewing process. No more than two beads could be used at the same time in a vat of up to a thousand gallons. These beads dramatically improved the beer or ales color, flavor, smell, and texture and quadrupled the entire batchs shelf-life as well as quadrupled the distance the brews could be exported without a loss of quality and spoilage.
Two types of beads of brewing existed. The beads of a light brown color boosted the vats quality by twenty-five percent, and the dark brown beads improved it by fifty percent.
By the mid-14 century DR, very few knew how to create such magic items. Only the most trusted allies of the Brewers Guild, like Ashakar Piscelene of Ashakars Accessories in Ravens Bluff, were entrusted with the secret. Ashakar and fellow trusted mages created the beads exclusively for the members of the guild and only for breweries in the city of Ravens Bluffs and within territories controlled by it. Though such exclusivity, the Brewers Guild sought to make Ravens Bluff the beer-brewing center of Faer√ªn.
