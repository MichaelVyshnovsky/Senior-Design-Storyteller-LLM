The Great Wolfs Fury was an enchanted spear wielded by Raika in the late 15 century DR.
The enchanted polearm was topped with a thick split metal tip, shaped like the symbol for the number "2" in the Iokharic script. The same symbol glowed on the spears head. The metal edges of the spearhead glowed with same magical energy.
The Great Wolfs Fury was enchanted to deal additional magical damage and quickened the wielder so they could land two swift strikes in place of one.
The Great Wolfs Fury was forged and ensorcelled by Laeral Silverhand out of broken swords of a hobgoblin bounty hunter gang that had been defeated by Raika. The half-orcish barbarian claimed that she had been overcome by the spirit of the Great Wolf, aiding her in the battle.
