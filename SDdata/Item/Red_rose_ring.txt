A '''''red rose ring''''' was an honorific distinction, bestowed upon knights of the [[Knights of the Dove|Order of the Dove]], in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This award was reserved for Doves who had defeated a powerful monster without the use of lethal [[weapon]]s or harmful [[magic]].

If a Knight of the Dove earned this award, they were eligible to serve as one of the city's "Dove Emissaries", who acted as guides and protectors for Ravenian and foreign diplomats.
