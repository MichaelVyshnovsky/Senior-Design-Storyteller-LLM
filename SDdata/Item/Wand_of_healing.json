        "mainbody": "Wands of healing were enchanted rods that provided spellcasters with healing at a time of need.\nWands of healing that dated back to the preâ€“Weeping War Myth Drannor were usually crafted out of driftwood that was shaped into a rod or a wand and polished.\nWands of healing allowed their wielders to cast the cure light wounds spell. An average wand came with twenty-four charges of the spell.\nIn 1369 DR, multiple wands of healing could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor. These wands could be found in possession of various undead creatures that once were healers of the ancient elven city. One owner of a wand of healing was the orc chieftain Zud whose tribe made their home in the Dwarven Dungeons under the City of Song."
