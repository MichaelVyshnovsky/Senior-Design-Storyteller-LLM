An '''authokh''' (OTH-awk) was a coin minted in [[Chessenta]] and commonly used in the region of [[Faer√ªn]] that included the [[Border Kingdoms]], [[Tashalar]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], and lands to the south of these. It was accepted at its full value (five [[gold piece]]s) in places like [[Amn]], [[Scornubel]], and [[Westgate]], but was not recognized in [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], the [[Dalelands]], the [[Dragon Reach]], the [[Moonsea]], the [[Sword Coast]], or [[Tethyr]]. In [[Waterdeep]] and [[Calimshan]], it was worth one [[silver piece]].

==Description==
Early authokhs were square with a small hole in the center for stringing together on a leather lace or the like. The design on one side was twelve leaves arranged in a ring that surrounded the hole. The image on the reverse was twelve daggers arranged in a ring with tips pointing outward.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta}}

The coin was stamped from "delmed" silver&mdash;an alloy of silver, [[copper]] and other bright metals in exact proportions, giving it a translucent green tint with a surface that would not take a polish like other metal coins.

==History==
This coin was originally minted long ago in a city somewhere in Chessenta, but the name of the city has been forgotten. Back then, it had a value of twelve gold pieces, but has since been revalued at five gold pieces. As of the reign of Shala Karanok, the Chessentan mint was in [[Luthcheq]]. The authokh and its sibling, the [[bebolt]], were used instead of the [[platinum]] piece as a convenient trading currency by merchants who traveled extensively in the region.
