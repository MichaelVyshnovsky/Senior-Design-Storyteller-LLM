The '''''Outlander''''' was the enchanted [[bow]] found in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Outlander'' appeared to be a crude wooden bow, carved with magical sigils that glowed with eerie green radiance.

==Powers==
[[File:Saarvin and the outlander.jpg|thumb|''Saarvin and his enchanted bow.'']]
When the ''Outlander'' was used to shoot, the bow's magic could summon additional [[arrow]]s and send them towards the wielder's enemies. These ensorcelled arrows took aim at random targets, never sending more that one arrow per target.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Saarvin]]: a [[dragonborn]] [[ranger]] adventurer who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
