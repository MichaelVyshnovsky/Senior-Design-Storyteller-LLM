'''''Gloves of hail of thorns''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that gave their wearers access to offensive magics.

==Description==
These [[leather]] gloves were decorated with thirty superficial scrapes, six at the base of each finger.

==Powers==
The wearer was granted the ability to cast the ''[[hail of thorns]]'' [[spell]] once per rest of at least four hours.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], [[Derryth Bonecloak]], a herbalist from [[Baldur's Gate]], owned a pair of these magical gloves. She, alongside her ''[[feeblemind]]'' affected husband, traveled from the Gray Harbor to a friendly [[myconid]] colony in [[Underdark]] to search for cure-all [[mushroom]]s called [[noblestalk]]s. Another pair belonged to a [[Zhentarim]] smuggler merchant named [[Brem]], who operated from a hideout underneath [[Waukeen's Rest]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. He offered the gloves as a reward for retiring a valuable shipment lost in a [[gnoll]] attack on the [[Risen Road]].
