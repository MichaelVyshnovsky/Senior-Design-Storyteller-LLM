        "mainbody": "forgehammer of Gond was a variety of artifact that the deity of blacksmithing Gond used to forge intricate devices.\nWhen a forgehammer of Gond was activated, it summoned a powerful magical tool that proved useful for nearly any crafting profession. It also gave the wielder the insight of Gond, making them harmed less by attacks made against them.\nIn the late-15 century DR, Gond occasionally gifted these to particularly skilled craftsmen to enable them to create even greater wonders."
