The '''''First Imaskarcana''''' was an [[artifact]] said to be amongst the most powerful ever created by the artificers of [[Imaskar]]. It was one of the [[Imaskarcana|''Seven Imaskarcana'']]. 

==Description==
The ''First Imaskarcana'' was a large, crudely wrought crown of lavender-tinted metal set with a single [[star sapphire]]. Despite being created to be worn by [[human]]s, the ''First Imaskarcana'' could fit any humanoid of similar size to humans quite comfortably.

==Powers==
The ''First Imaskarcana'' held the collected knowledge of the empire's Lord Artificers. However, it would never engage in conversation, instead responding only to direct questions and always with brief answers.

It provided the wearer with strong spell resistance and, if commanded to, it would cast [[spell]]s on behalf of its wearer. It had spells related to interplanar travel, piercing illusions, and antimagic. One of its spell powers, ''[[legend lore]]'', would only work upon Imaskari items. However, all commands had to be spoken in [[Roushoum]]; if addressed in a different language, the artifact would cast a ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell upon its wearer.

==History==
The ''First Imaskarcana'' was thought to have been created over nine thousand years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but other sources dated creation of all seven to {{yearlink|-3891}}, under the orders of Lord Artificer [[Omanond]] of [[Inupras]].<ref> It was worn by Lord Artificer [[Yuvaraj]] when he was slain by the avatar of [[Horus-Re|Horus]] in [[Inupras]] in {{yearlink|-2488}}. The artifact was said to still lie deep beneath the sands of the ruins of Inupras, not far from the palace, in the 14{{th}} century DR.

Mysteriously, the ''First Imaskarcana'' was claimed by the [[One of Many]], a being of pure malice and evil, born in the shadow [[Mulsantir]]. The One of Many was in possession of the crown when it resurfaced in the deep jungles of the [[Samarlogh]], deep jungles in the hidden nation of [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
