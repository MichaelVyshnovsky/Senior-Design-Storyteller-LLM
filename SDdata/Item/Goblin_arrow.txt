'''''Goblin arrows''''', despite their name, were not missiles used by [[goblin]]s, but a type of [[enchanted]] [[arrow]] created by a black-hearted [[gnome]] [[Turbar Talinbar]].

==Powers==
Even though these arrows possessed ''+1'' enchantment, they were now known for their damaging power. The magics imbued into ''goblin arrows'' were activated once a missile hit a target. It summoned forth an incredibly agitated and hostile goblin. The monstrous humanoid remained there for the next seventeen minutes before being sent back from wherever the creature was pulled from.

==History==
''Goblin arrows'' were invented sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, by an evil gnome Turbar Talinbar. Since then, these items have become known for being an invaluable method of distraction or annoyance. Most commonly, ''goblin arrows'' could be found in the hands of mischievous [[halfling]]s and [[elves]]. However, several adventuring troupes have used a number of these arrows before entering challenging battles.
