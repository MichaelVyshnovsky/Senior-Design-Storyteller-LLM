Eigersstor Noblerot was an alcoholic drink from the city of Neverwinter. It was exported as far as the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.
Named after Eigersstor, an early incarnation of the the City of Skilled Hands, Noblerot had a distinct Neverwintran taste â€“ earthy and chewy. The drink itself had a slightly green tint. Eigersstor Noblerot was bottled in round bottles of green glass, encased in a wicker.
