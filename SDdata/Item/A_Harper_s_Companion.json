        "mainbody": "'''''A Harper's Companion''''' was a series of songbooks written circa [[1200 DR]] by the [[Cormyr]]ian bard [[Cressaed Wood]]. It comprised three volumes, each containing a number of songs, which carried magical effects, similar to [[spell]]s.{{Cite web/A Harper's Companion, Volume III}}",
        "Volumes": {
            "Volume I": "There were twelve known finished copies of volume I, which contained [[cantrip]]s. At least one copy was housed at [[Candlekeep]], and the remaining copies were mostly found in private libraries.",
            "Volume II": "There were five known finished copies of volume II, and these contained songs that, when performed, would act like spells. Candlekeep possessed one copy, a Master [[Harper]] possessed another, and the other known copy was in the hands of a private collector in [[Waterdeep]], while the whereabouts of the other two copies remained unknown.",
            "Volume III": "There were only two known finished copies of the third volume, which contained songs with spell effects more powerful than those from the previous volumes. Although one copy was kept as a family heirloom by the [[Ironclaw]] bard family of [[Suzail]], the other was lost, disappearing with its owner shortly after it was presented.\n\nThis copy was discovered by [[Halarim Threesilver]] and his companions, a mercenary company who were scouting in Cormyr and western [[Sembia]] after the war with the [[Devil Dragon]] and the [[ghazneth]]s. He wrote a letter home, telling of his discovery, which was dated [[Eleint 21]], [[1371 DR]], but he and his companions were never heard from after that, and were presumed dead.\n\nThe third volume was worth around 5000 [[gp]], but due to its significance in Cormyr, scholars there might have paid up to 6000 gp. Since Candlekeep already possessed the other two volumes, it would have paid 10,000 gp or take it as the library's entrance fee.\n\nThe third volume contained the following songs:\n* ''[[Arveene the Suspicious Wife]]'' (''[[invisibility]]'')\n* ''[[Ballad of the Mad King]]'' (''[[rage]]'')\n* ''[[The Doom of Steddman Dunn]]'' (''[[nightmare lullaby]]'')\n* ''[[Hastel's Drinking Song]]'' (''[[delay poison]]'')\n* ''[[O, Were that I a Bird]]'' (''[[animal messenger]]'')\n* ''[[Rand the Auspicious Beggar]]'' (''[[tongues]]'')\n* ''[[Take My Hand, My Love]]'' (''[[cure moderate wounds]]'')"
