The '''''solution of stillness''''' was a thick, oily substance that when poured in the ocean, could calm the waves and torrents in a space within a storm.

==Effects==
One bottle of this liquid calmed the waters in an area 50-feet in radius and last for 2-24 hours. It could also be used to negate any [[magic]]al waves, such as those created by the spell ''[[tidal wave]]'', or have the same effect of an ''[[antipathy]]'' spell when used on creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Water|plane of water]].

==Creation==
This solution was created with the [[spell]]s ''antipathy'' and ''[[control weather]]''.
