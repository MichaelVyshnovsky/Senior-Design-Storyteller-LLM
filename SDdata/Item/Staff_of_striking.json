        "mainbody": "A '''''staff of striking''''' was a very rare [[magic]] [[quarterstaff]].",
        "Description": "''Staves of striking'' were made of timber from an [[oak]] tree.\n\nOnly those with knowledge of [[arcane]] and/or [[divine]] [[magic]], such as [[mage]]s and [[cleric]]s, could wield such staves.",
        "Powers": "They were [[magic]] weapons with a ''+3'' enchantment, and were particularly good at penetrating physical defenses. If a set of armor was prone to being bludgeoned, the staff striking it would act as a bludgeoning weapon, ''etc''.\n\nAs did many other magical weapons, ''staves of striking'' had a certain number of charges. The staff could expend up to three charges on a single hit. The more charges used, the more additional damage was done.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Murlyn]], a [[Harper]] [[bard]]{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|52|Blind Lemon Murlyn}}\n* [[Adnan al-Raqi]], a powerful [[sha'ir]]\n* [[Moral]], a [[Zakharan]] high [[priest]]{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|67}}\n* [[Maerovyna]], a [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] who lived in [[Daggerford]], carried a ''staff of striking''.",
        "Notable Staves of Striking": "* ''[[Staff of the Ram]]'', a [[staff]] that was believed to have been invented by the same [[archmage]] responsible for the ''[[ring of the ram]]''."
