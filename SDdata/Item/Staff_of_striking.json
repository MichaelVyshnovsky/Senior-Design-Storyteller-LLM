        "mainbody": "A staff of striking was a very rare magic quarterstaff.\nStaves of striking were made of timber from an oak tree.\nOnly those with knowledge of arcane and/or divine magic, such as mages and clerics, could wield such staves.\nThey were magic weapons with a +3 enchantment, and were particularly good at penetrating physical defenses. If a set of armor was prone to being bludgeoned, the staff striking it would act as a bludgeoning weapon, etc.\nAs did many other magical weapons, staves of striking had a certain number of charges. The staff could expend up to three charges on a single hit. The more charges used, the more additional damage was done.\n* Murlyn, a Harper bard\n* Adnan al-Raqi, a powerful shair\n* Moral, a Zakharan high priest\n* Maerovyna, a druid of Chauntea who lived in Daggerford, carried a staff of striking.\n* Staff of the Ram, a staff that was believed to have been invented by the same archmage responsible for the ring of the ram."
