An adze was a common axe-like woodworking tool found in Faer√ªn.
The adze resembled an axe with its head turned sideways, somewhat like a mattock or hoe. It could be made with a stone head if necessary, but would be made from a durable metal if at all possible.
Adzes were basic tools commonly made by blacksmiths and bought up by carpenters, shipwrights, and anyone else who worked wood.
An adze was an important part of any toolkit for basic woodworking, alongside a chisel, hatchet, saw, hammer, nails, a plane, a square, and a ruler.
An adze could also be used as a clumsy weapon in an emergency, similar to a hand axe, with shorter-handled varieties used specifically for war.
The wood shape spell used a miniature carpenters adze as a material component.
