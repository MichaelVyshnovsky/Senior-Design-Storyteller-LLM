        "mainbody": "The '''''amulet of dark flesh''''' was a unique [[cursed]] [[amulet]].",
        "Description": "This amulet had a leather body with a green [[gem]] at the center.",
        "Powers": "Being a cursed item, this amulet became affixed to whoever put it on and could only be removed by the [[spell]] ''[[remove curse]]''. In addition, those who donned it suffered from the spell ''[[paralyze]]'' as well as a minor wasting [[disease]] that very slowly killed the wearer.",
        "History": "This amulet was created some time prior to the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]] by a [[Calishite]] [[necromancer]] named [[Niri Eddin]]. He would gift the cursed item to his enemies, then have [[thief]] servants retrieve it once the wasting disease had taken its toll.\n\nFor reasons unknown, Niri eventually lost ownership of the ''amulet of dark flesh'' and in [[1281 DR]] it was seen in the possession of the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Malavon Despana]]."
