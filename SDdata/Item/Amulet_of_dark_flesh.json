        "mainbody": "The amulet of dark flesh was a unique cursed amulet.\nThis amulet had a leather body with a green gem at the center.\nBeing a cursed item, this amulet became affixed to whoever put it on and could only be removed by the spell remove curse. In addition, those who donned it suffered from the spell paralyze as well as a minor wasting disease that very slowly killed the wearer.\nThis amulet was created some time prior to the late 13 century DR by a Calishite necromancer named Niri Eddin. He would gift the cursed item to his enemies, then have thief servants retrieve it once the wasting disease had taken its toll.\nFor reasons unknown, Niri eventually lost ownership of the amulet of dark flesh and in 1281 DR it was seen in the possession of the drow wizard Malavon Despana."
