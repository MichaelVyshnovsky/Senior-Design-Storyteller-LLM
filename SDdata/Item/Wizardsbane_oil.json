        "mainbody": "'''''Wizardsbane oil''''' was a type of [[magic]] [[oil]] used to temporarily handicap [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and other spellcasters.",
        "Description": "The oil was an obviously magical substance. When one peered into the vial, they could see symbols for the eight [[schools of magic]] shift and move in the oil, appearing and dissolving one at a time.",
        "Powers": "The oil could be applied to weapons or thrown at the targets, shattering the vials. Those spellcasters who were touched by the oil found it difficult to concentrate on magic, began to misfire or miscast [[spell]]s, and successfully cast magics were more likely to break and disperse.",
        "Creation": "''Wizardsbane oil'' was created by [[alchemical]]ly extracting the essence from [[gremishka]] tails and mining it with certain types of alchemical suspension."
