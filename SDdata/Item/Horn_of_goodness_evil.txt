'''''Horns of goodness/evil''''' were [[trumpet]]s that had limited musical capability but powerful [[enchantment]]s.

==Powers==
These instruments were capable of producing only two musical tones: a high ringing carillon peal that acred as the ''[[magic circle against evil]]'' spell and a low moan that summoned a ''[[magic circle against good]]''. Either one of these notes could be produced only once per day.

A variant of these trumpets, ''horns of goodness'' that could only protect the user from creatures of good, had a nasty chance of changing the [[bard]] who used it. There was a coin-toss chase that if a goodly person were to use it, the horn's magics perverted them, turning them closer to the side of evil.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Gar Saru]], a retired knight from [[Ravens Bluff]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
