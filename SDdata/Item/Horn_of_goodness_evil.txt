Horns of goodness/evil were trumpets that had limited musical capability but powerful enchantments.
These instruments were capable of producing only two musical tones a high ringing carillon peal that acred as the magic circle against evil spell and a low moan that summoned a magic circle against good. Either one of these notes could be produced only once per day.
A variant of these trumpets, horns of goodness that could only protect the user from creatures of good, had a nasty chance of changing the bard who used it. There was a coin-toss chase that if a goodly person were to use it, the horns magics perverted them, turning them closer to the side of evil.
