Saint Markovias Thighbone was a remnant of Markovia, the worshiper of Morninglord and the ancient enemy of Strahd von Zarovich.
Saint Markovias Thighbone was a club made out of the thighbone of the woman who assembled forces and attempted to slay the vampire lord of Barovia. She was defeated and locked in a tomb underneath Strahds Castle Ravenloft. Markovias divine blessing remained within her body and eventually empowered her bones.
This thick and sturdy enchanted bone was scribed with holy symbols of several gods.
