Saint Markovias Thighbone was a remnant of Markovia, the worshiper of Morninglord and the ancient enemy of Strahd von Zarovich.
Saint Markovias Thighbone was a club made out of the thighbone of the woman who assembled forces and attempted to slay the vampire lord of Barovia. She was defeated and locked in a tomb underneath Strahds Castle Ravenloft. Markovias divine blessing remained within her body and eventually empowered her bones.
This thick and sturdy enchanted bone was scribed with holy symbols of several gods.

St. Markovias Thighbone had an enchantment that gave the wielder a chance to heal themselves upon a successful strike. Additionally, it randomly placed the death ward spell upon the wielder of the bone club or one of their allies.
Additionally, the thighbone had anti-undead powers, similar to those of maces of disruption.
If this bone mace was used against a vampire or vampire spawn it effectively functioned as a +3 mace of disruption. It it landed a successful hit, St. Markovias Thighbone disintegrated into dust after the end of the battle.
