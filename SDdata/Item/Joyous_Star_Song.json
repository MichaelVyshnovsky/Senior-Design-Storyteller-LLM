They were inscribed with musical notations and lyrics for inspiring songs.\nOnce per day, a bard singing the song inscribed on the scroll would receive divine inspiration, performing longer and better than usual.\nThe first Joyous Star Song scrolls were created by the Church of Milil and the Church of Lliira."
