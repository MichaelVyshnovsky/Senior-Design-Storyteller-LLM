        "History": "The blade once once in the possession of a [[Githyanki]] lord, who was quite skilled with its use. An adventurer from the [[Prime Material plane]] defeated the lord in battle, took the sword and brought it to his home plane of existence. Gith allies pursued the adventurer and after a great battle mortally wounded him. It was rumored the sword was then recovered by the Dalesman [[wizard]] [[Shraevyn]], though no sign of it existed in his [[Shraevyn's Tomb|tomb]] or among the riches he left in his will."
