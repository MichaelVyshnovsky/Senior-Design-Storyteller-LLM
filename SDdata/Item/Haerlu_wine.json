        "mainbody": "'''Haerlu wine''', also known as '''Haerlu Gold''', was a strong aged alcoholic drink that was as much of [[Halruaa]]'s nation symbol as its ''[[Halruaan skyship|skyships]]''.",
        "Description": "Haerlu Gold was renown for its fiery taste. The pale golden alcohol was served in [[decanter]]s and drank in single gulps from small [[goblet]]s. Southerners, like those from [[Mulhorand]], liked to add a splash of this potent [[brandy]] to [[green tea]] brewed with [[honey]] and [[ginger]].",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Haerlu wine was one of Halruaa's major exports. The wine was sold in [[Lapaliiya]], [[Chondath]], and across the southern shores of the [[Great Sea]]."
