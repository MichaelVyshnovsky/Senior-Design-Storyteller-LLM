'''Algae''' was an [[ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] found in [[Faer√ªn]] that was used as decoration on [[baldric]]s, belts, and as an inlay on fine furniture.

==Description==
Algae was a variety of quartz similar to [[banded agate]] but the bands were wavy and usually found in shades of dark brown. These gemstones were usually cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] or sliced, and polished to a glassy finish to bring out the design. A typical stone had a base value of 10 [[gp]].

==Powers==
A being in direct contact with algae, or wearing it, was more likely to resist [[polymorph]]ing effects caused by [[spells]], [[psionic]] attacks, and other [[arcane magic|arcane]] or [[divine magic|divine]] shape-altering enchantments. This resistance was conferred whether the subject was willing or not.
