'''Pine nuts''' were hard-shelled edible seeds of the [[pine]] [[tree]] sometimes consumed in the land of [[Calimshan]].

==Availability==
Pine nuts were among travel rations eaten in Calimshan, alongside dried [[date]]s and [[scorchmeat]].

In the rest of the [[Sword Coast]] and the City of Splendor, [[Waterdeep]], pine nuts were sold in [[Aurora's Emporium]] and via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', valued at ten [[gold]] [[coin]]s per {{SI|1|lb|k|long=yes}}.

Outside the [[Prime Material plane]], pine nuts were among items treasured by the [[ratatosk]]s of [[Yggdrasil]] in [[Arborea]]. Pine nuts among other nuts were infused with magics to function in a similar fashion to [[potion]]s.
