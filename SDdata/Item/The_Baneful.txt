'''''The Baneful''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]] wielded by [[Orin the Red]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''The Baneful'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the blade's damage. Each successful attack with the sword affected the target with the ''[[bane]]'' [[spell]], reducing their battle prowess for a short period of time. ''The Baneful'' could also be bound to an [[eldritch knight]]'s hand or used by a [[warlock]] as a pact weapon.

==History==
''The Baneful'' was a blade known to the [[wizard]] [[Otiluke]] of [[Oerth]], who penned a work on the topic of [[arcane]] bound blades. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''The Baneful'' belonged to [[Blurg]], an [[orog]] member of the [[Society of Brilliance]], during his stay at the [[Ebonlake Grotto]] underneath the [[Western Heartlands]]. He was willing to sell the weapon to an adventurer who was an ally and brought enough [[coin]].
