Lorbralinth, also known as just lorbral, was a poison found in Faer√ªn.
This poisonous liquid was clear, with an oily feel and a pleasant, sweet scent. It was concocted from mixing the saliva of a basilisk, a leucrotta, and fourteen other creatures. It could be added to food or could be used to treat an edged weapon.
Lorbral could be handled relatively safely, but once it was ingested or entered the blood stream through a wound the victim was overcome with chills, then broke out in a raging fever, then came down with chills again, and so on, alternating between too hot and too cold. The victim was wracked by these effects for a short time and then typically recovered (if they survived).
