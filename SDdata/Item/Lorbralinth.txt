'''Lorbralinth''', also known as just '''lorbral''', was a [[poison]] found in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
This poisonous liquid was clear, with an oily feel and a pleasant, sweet scent. It was concocted from mixing the saliva of a [[basilisk]], a [[leucrotta]], and fourteen other creatures. It could be added to food or could be used to treat an edged weapon.

==Effects==
Lorbral could be handled relatively safely, but once it was ingested or entered the blood stream through a wound the victim was overcome with chills, then broke out in a raging fever, then came down with chills again, and so on, alternating between too hot and too cold. The victim was wracked by these effects for a short time and then typically recovered (if they survived).
