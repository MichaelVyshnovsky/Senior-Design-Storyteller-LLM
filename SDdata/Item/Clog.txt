'''Clogs''' were a common form of footwear in [[Faerûn]] made of wood. They were worn by both adults and children.

==Availability==
* [[Ilbrelm Nasker]], a cobbler in city of [[Alaghôn]], produced great quantities of clogs with mundane designs in all manner of sizes for a low price. His handiwork could be found worn by poor folk from far afield in Faerûn due to the [[Sembia]]n merchant [[Melvos Hammerstars]].{{Cite web/Realmslore/Melvos Hammerstars, Part Eight}}
* The [[Order of Cobblers and Corvisers]] in [[Waterdeep]] were known to both make and repair clogs with thick soles, which Waterdhavians would wear during times of rain and snow.

==History==
The existence of clogs on [[Toril]] dated as far back as the [[Netherese Empire]].
