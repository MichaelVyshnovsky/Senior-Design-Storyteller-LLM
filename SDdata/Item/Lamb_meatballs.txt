Lamb meatballs were balls of minced lamb meat used as a part of many dishes across the Realms.
Dishes made with lamb meat and more specifically with lamb meatballs were cooked across the hin land of Luiren in the Shining South, in Chessenta of the Old Empires, and the areas of the Dalelands that were perched on the Dragon Reach.
A separate variety of minced lamb meatballs shaped and plastered into an elongated form on kebabs was called "lambtails." These lambtails were found in the lands of Teziir and the city of Westgate.
