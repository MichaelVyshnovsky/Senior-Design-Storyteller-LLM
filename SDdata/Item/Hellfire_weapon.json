As a result of this process, the weapon was suffused with brilliant veins of hellfire. The faint light from the weapon illuminated the surrounding area in a  radius.\nWhen a creature was killed with a hellfire weapon, their soul was instantly sent to the Styx. As a result, the soul was transformed into a lemure."
