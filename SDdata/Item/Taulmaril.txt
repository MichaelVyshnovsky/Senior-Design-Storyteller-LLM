'''''Taulmaril''''', also known as the '''Heartseeker''', was [[Catti-brie]]'s magic [[bow]],{{Cite web/The Lone Drow: Companions of the Hall}} which passed on to [[Drizzt]] after her death (and remained with him even after her rebirth).

==Description==
===Longbow===
Heartseeker was a beautifully crafted [[Elven bow|elven]] longbow +3 made of polished wood. The elven craftsmen made the bow so strong even stone cannot scratch the marvelous wood, and the deep finish of its polish can be returned by a single brush of the hand.

===Quiver===
The bow was also accompanied by the [[Quiver of Anariel]], which contained twenty +1 [[alchemical silver]]

After the [[Spellplague]], the arrows were depicted as having a [[Lightning arrow|lightning]] effect. Additionally, the arrows could apparently be enchanted with light to create a [[torch]].

==History==
Originally the [[longbow]] was a gift from Lady [[Anariel]], Sister of [[Faer√ªn]], to [[Clan Battlehammer]], but in [[1356 DR]], the [[Companions of the Hall]] entered the ruins of the Hall of [[Dumathoin]] in [[Mithril Hall]] and [[Regis]] found the bow hidden in a gap in the stone wall. Later, Catti-brie gave Taulmaril to [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] after she was injured in [[1370 DR]]. He kept the bow in his possession even after Catti-brie's rebirth, since she was no longer in practice and generally used her new proficiency in [[magic]].
