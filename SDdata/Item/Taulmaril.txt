Taulmaril, also known as the Heartseeker, was Catti-bries magic bow, which passed on to Drizzt after her death (and remained with him even after her rebirth).
Heartseeker was a beautifully crafted elven longbow +3 made of polished wood. The elven craftsmen made the bow so strong even stone cannot scratch the marvelous wood, and the deep finish of its polish can be returned by a single brush of the hand.
The bow was also accompanied by the Quiver of Anariel, which contained twenty +1 alchemical silver
After the Spellplague, the arrows were depicted as having a lightning effect. Additionally, the arrows could apparently be enchanted with light to create a torch.
Originally the longbow was a gift from Lady Anariel, Sister of Faer√ªn, to Clan Battlehammer, but in 1356 DR, the Companions of the Hall entered the ruins of the Hall of Dumathoin in Mithril Hall and Regis found the bow hidden in a gap in the stone wall. Later, Catti-brie gave Taulmaril to Drizzt DoUrden after she was injured in 1370 DR. He kept the bow in his possession even after Catti-bries rebirth, since she was no longer in practice and generally used her new proficiency in magic.
