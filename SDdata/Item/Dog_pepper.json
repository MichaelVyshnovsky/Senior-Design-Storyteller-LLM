        "mainbody": "'''Dog pepper''' was a diversionary tool used by [[thieves]] to distract [[dog]]s, similar to [[aniseed]] though comparatively less effective.",
        "Description": "Dog pepper came in small packets, holding enough to cover a {{SI|10|ft}} cube. When dropped on the ground behind them, a fleeing thief could potentially cover-up their scent, though they had better results when throwing dog pepper up into the air. Alternatively, a thief could throw dog pepper directly into the face of a hound to drive them hysterical for an hour.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Jack (Ravens Bluff)|Jack the Cripple]], a professional [[beggar]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] who faked being crippled, carried around a packet of dog pepper.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|17}}\n* [[Pete (Ravens Bluff)|Pete]], an androgynous pickpocket in Ravens Bluff, carried around a packet of dog pepper.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|18}}"
