'''''Jester's Chain''''' was a unique set of [[enchanted]] [[chainmail]] that once was worn by [[Dekirh Fasthands]], a [[jester]]-[[bard]] from the [[Sword Coast]], who lives some time before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Originally, this set of magic [[armor]] looked absolutely mundane. However, Dekirh Fasthands wore it to stage and painted it in a bright jester fashion: in reds, blues, and [[gold]]s.

==Powers==
In addition to its potent ''+4'' defensive enchantment, ''Jester's Chain'' also offered the wearer increased resistance to slashing and crushing damage.

==History==
''Jester's Chain'' was a gift to Dekirh Fasthands from his friends who were worried for the jester's well-being as he insisted on performing in some of the rowdiest taverns across the Sword Coast some time before the mid-14{{th}} century DR. The armor was to protect the bard from things that often was thrown at him during the performances: rotten produce and [[knives]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Hue Greenleaf]], a merchant in [[Red Wizard]] [[Dennaton]]'s gladiatorial arena in [[Thay]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
