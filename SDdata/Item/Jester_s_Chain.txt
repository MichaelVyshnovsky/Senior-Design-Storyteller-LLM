Jesters Chain was a unique set of enchanted chainmail that once was worn by Dekirh Fasthands, a jester-bard from the Sword Coast, who lives some time before the mid-14 century DR.
Originally, this set of magic armor looked absolutely mundane. However, Dekirh Fasthands wore it to stage and painted it in a bright jester fashion in reds, blues, and golds.
In addition to its potent +4 defensive enchantment, Jesters Chain also offered the wearer increased resistance to slashing and crushing damage.
Jesters Chain was a gift to Dekirh Fasthands from his friends who were worried for the jesters well-being as he insisted on performing in some of the rowdiest taverns across the Sword Coast some time before the mid-14 century DR. The armor was to protect the bard from things that often was thrown at him during the performances rotten produce and knives.
