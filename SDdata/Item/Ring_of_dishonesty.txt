A ring of dishonesty was an enchanted ring that allowed the wearer to tell convincing lies.
The power of these rings made the lies of the wearer appear to be the truth even when examined by spells such as discern lies. 
Shutep, a thief inhabiting the Great Vale, wore a ring of dishonesty on one of his toes.
