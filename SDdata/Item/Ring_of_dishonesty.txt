A '''''ring of dishonesty''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that allowed the wearer to tell convincing lies.

==Powers==
The power of these rings made the lies of the wearer appear to be the truth even when examined by [[spell]]s such as ''[[discern lies]]''. 

==Notable Owners==
[[Shutep]], a [[thief]] inhabiting the [[Great Vale]], wore a ''ring of dishonesty'' on one of his toes.
