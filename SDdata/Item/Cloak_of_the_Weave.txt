The cloak of the Weave was a magical, protective cloak that allowed the wearer to absorb and harness elemental energy.
Twice per day, the cloak of the Weave could be used to absorb elemental energy and partially neage any harm they suffered from its effect. That energy was then redirected to the wearers own powers, and allowed them to inflict a portion of that energy against foes during any next attack they made.
Additionally, the cloak granted the wearer inherent protection against magical spells and their effects.
As of the , the cloak remained in the possession of Helsik, the diabolist trader who operated the Devils Fee arcana shop in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
