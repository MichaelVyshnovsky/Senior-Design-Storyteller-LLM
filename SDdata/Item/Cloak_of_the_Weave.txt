The '''''cloak of the Weave''''' was a [[magic]]al, protective cloak that allowed the wearer to absorb and harness elemental energy.

==Powers==
Twice per day, the ''cloak of the Weave'' could be used to ''[[absorb elements|absorb elemental energy]]'' and partially neage any harm they suffered from its effect. That energy was then redirected to the wearer's own powers, and allowed them to inflict a portion of that energy against foes during any next attack they made.

Additionally, the cloak granted the wearer inherent protection against magical spells and their effects.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the cloak remained in the possession of [[Helsik]], the diabolist trader who operated the [[Devil's Fee]] arcana shop in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Tenser]], a famous mage from the world of [[Oerth]].
