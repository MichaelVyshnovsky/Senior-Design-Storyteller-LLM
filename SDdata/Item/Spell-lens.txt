A '''''spell-lens''''' was a [[magic item]] that increased the potency of [[wand]]s.

==Description==
These items looked like small glass ovals with a socket on one end that could be attached to a wand.

==Powers==
[[Spell]]s cast from a wand affixed with a ''spell-lens'' were far more powerful at the cost of three times the normal amount of charges needed to cast the spell.

==History==
These items were initially created in ancient [[Netheril]] and were only recently discovered, as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, by explorers from [[Undermountain]] within the [[Sargauth Enclave]].
