A spell-lens was a magic item that increased the potency of wands.
These items looked like small glass ovals with a socket on one end that could be attached to a wand.
Spells cast from a wand affixed with a spell-lens were far more powerful at the cost of three times the normal amount of charges needed to cast the spell.
These items were initially created in ancient Netheril and were only recently discovered, as of the , by explorers from Undermountain within the Sargauth Enclave.
