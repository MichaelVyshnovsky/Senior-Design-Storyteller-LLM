==Description==
These magical items were available in a wide variety.

==Powers==
These staves granted to following powers to a wizard at the expense of one charge: ''[[alter normal winds]]'', ''[[flying jambiya]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', ''[[wind blade]]'', and ''[[ wind wall]]''.

The following powers consumed two charges for regular wizards and only one charge for [[Elemental mage|wind mages]]: ''[[conjure air elemental]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]'', ''[[wind carpet]]'', and ''[[summon wind dragons]]''.
