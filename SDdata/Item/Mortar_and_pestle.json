        "mainbody": "Mortar and pestle were tools designed to crush solid materials into powder or to extract active ingredients from plants and herbs. They were an integral part of alchemists supplies, herbalism kits, and wizards laboratories.\nA typical mortar and pestle set was smoothly polished in the outside areas, that were most likely to be handled, and rough on the inside, so as to maximize grinding and crushing efficiency.\nMore expensive mortar and pestle sets were gilded. This was not for luxurys sake, however. Wooden instruments were hard to clean, and metallic ones interfered with components, sometimes in disastrous ways. To avoided that, mortars and pestles could be coated in a thin layer of gold.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold two different sizes of mortar and pestle sets made of black marble.\n* Morrigans Complete Components in Ravens Bluff had a variety of mortars and pestles in stock.\nThe carapaces of sartani were sometimes used to craft mortars in parts of Zakhara.\n* Khelben Arunsun once owned a finely crafted set made by Rashemi from black marble, but lost it some time following the Spellplague. Having once been owned by such a legendary individual, this mortar and pestle could fetch prices upward of 500 gp."
