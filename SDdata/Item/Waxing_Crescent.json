It was decorated with mother-of-pearl and silver and etched with the symbol of a crescent inside a circle. The weapon was a twin to the Waning Crescent.\nThe blade could light with silver flame on command.\nThe sword was functional but rarely shown outside of ceremonies. It symbolized the office of the priest or priestess responsible for the external affairs of the temple, one of the most honorable positions in the clergy.\nThe sword was carried by the priest Mifano circa 1373 DR, who competed with fellow priestess Velsinore for influence under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar."
