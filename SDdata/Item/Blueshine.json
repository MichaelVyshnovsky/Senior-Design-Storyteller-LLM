        "mainbody": "'''Blueshine''' was a [[armor quality|special magical quality]] that could be applied to metal [[armor]], giving it a blue-black color and prevented it from being tarnished, becoming rusty, or being damaged by [[acid]]. It also allowed its wearer to hide significantly more easily.",
        "Process": "This quality was acquired by a series of actions in which the armor was heated, submersed in water and bathed in specific [[arcane]] solutions. The specially [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] liquids were composed of a ''[[potion of sweetwater]]'' that was mixed distilled [[cockatrice]] feathers and drops of blood taken from a variety of species of [[dragon]]s.\n\n''Blueshine'' enchantment was considered to be the best protection for armor when fighting [[giant slug]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tunnel Vision|14}}",
        "History": "The formulation to enhance a suit of armor as ''blueshine'' had been practices by the [[dwarves]] of [[Faer√ªn]] for centuries prior to the [[Era of Upheaval]]. It involved the ''[[stainless]]'' chant as one of its steps.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|28-29}}\n\nDuring the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Calishite]] [[wizard]] [[Toth]] created a [[blueshine (spell)|spell]] that mimicked the process that created the ''blueshine'' effect. For his effects, he was soon killed by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].",
