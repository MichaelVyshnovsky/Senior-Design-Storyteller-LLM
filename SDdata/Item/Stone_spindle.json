        "mainbody": "The '''''stone spindle''''' was an [[artifact]] that originated from the long-lost [[giant]] civilization of [[Ostoria]].",
        "Description": "The ''stone spindle'' itself comprised gray stone that stood {{SIAdj|10|ft|adj=tall}}. It bore upon its surface strange, unidentified symbols.\n\nIt was entirely impervious to physical and magical harm.",
        "Powers": "While its exact powers were unknown, the relic was capable of \"wreaking havoc\" upon [[the Weave]] itself. It was capable of at least dispelling the magic of ''[[mythallar]]''s, which were considered among the most powerful magical devices in the Realms.\n\nIf a spell of sufficient power were centered upon the spindle, a blast of [[anti-magic]] would release from the relic and extend outward for {{SI|3|mi|k}}. That area would become a [[dead-magic zone]] for a single day and all [[spellcaster]]s within would be unable to cast any prepared spells. Magical constructs, creatures crafted by magical means and [[living spell]]s were not affected by this blast.",
        "History": "The Spindle was said to have been crafted some time before the [[Days of Thunder]], some 40,000 years before the events of the [[Second Sundering]]. At some point in history, it fell into the depths of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] in the [[Frozenfar]].\n\nThe spindle was uncovered in the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, by [[arcanist]]s of [[Netheril]] and took it aboard the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Ythryn]]. The arcanists began to conduct experiments upon the strange giant relic to learn more. Unfortunately, one of the experiments went awry and an anti-magic discharge from the spindle cause the enclave's ''[[mythallar]]'' to malfunction. The flying city plummeted out of the sky and crashed into the icy wastes below. For years, it continued to emit magical radiation that disallowed any spellcasting within a certain radius. \n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the spindle remained within the [[Spire of Iriolarthas]] within the ruins of Ythryn. It was believed to have been dormant as of that time."
