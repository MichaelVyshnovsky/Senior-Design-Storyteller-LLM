        "mainbody": "A '''''philosopher's stone''''' was a rare magical substance and [[artifact]] reputed to have the power to [[transmutation|transmute]] base metals into precious metals, cure diseases, and even bring the dead back to life. They could be used by any wielder of [[arcane]] [[magic]], particularly [[alchemist]]s.",
        "Description": "Two main types of ''philosopher's stone'' have been reported.\n\nA ''philosopher's stone'' was originally said to appear exactly like a ''[[luckstone]]'' or ''[[loadstone]]''. In fact, discerning a ''philosopher's stone'' from a ''luckstone'' seemed to require some destructive testing: placing a suspect ''stone'' in molten lead would destroy a ''luckstone'', but not a ''philosopher's stone''. It was impervious to heat; even [[dragon]]-fire would not melt it. \n\nAlternatively, after the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a ''philosopher's stone'' was described as an ordinary-seeming hunk of sooty, blackish rock, weighing around {{SI|3|lb|k|long=yes}}. At its core was a cavity lined with magical [[mercury]], which was the operative part of the ''philosopher's stone''. However, the stone had to be broken open to access it, after which it became unstable and lost its power within the day.\n\nThere was also a rare type composed of crystalline salt and a very type composed of white powder. In any case, ''philosopher's stones'' could vary widely in quality and effectiveness.",
        "Powers": "The original type of ''philosopher's stone'' had anywhere up to eight charges, with a minimum of two. An alchemist could use one charge to boost their research abilities or else to transmute {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}} of [[lead]] into [[silver]] or [[gold]] (with a one-in-two chance). Provided one charge remained, an alchemist could not contract a disease while they possessed the ''stone'' on them, and could even [[cure disease]] once a day, without a charge being lost. But when the last charge was used, the ''stone'' [[disintegrate]]d. The ''[[glorious transmutation]]'' spell, of which only the mightiest mages were capable, used a ''philosopher's stone'' to transmute a greater mass of metal as the caster chose: 50‒500 pounds (23‒230 kilograms) of iron to silver or 10‒100 pounds (4.5‒45 kilograms) of lead to gold. The ''stone'' was destroyed in the process.\n\nIn the second type, an arcane spellcaster could use the magical mercury of one ''philosopher's stone'' to transmute {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}} of lead into gold, or {{SI|5000|lb|k|long=yes}} of [[iron]] into silver. Alternatively, the mercury could be mixed with any ''[[cure wounds]]'' [[potion]] to create a unique \"oil of life\" that, if sprinkled upon a corpse, would [[true resurrection|resurrect]] the deceased.\n\nTo a [[psionicist]], meanwhile, a ''philosopher's stone'' bestowed a very different benefit. When kept in contact with the skin, it enhanced their aptitude in manifesting [[psionic]] powers. A regular ''philosopher's stone'' enhanced powers in their primary discipline, while a crystalline salt stone enhanced powers in their primary discipline and another of their choice, while a white powder stone enhanced powers in their primary discipline and cause them to recover psionic energy twice the normal rate.\n\nA ''philosopher's stone'' was a prime [[material component]] for casting ''[[glorious transmutation]]''.",
        "Creation": "According to no less a sage than [[Elminster]], it was possible to make a ''philosopher's stone'', but the process was quite complex and involved. It was known that, first, a mage or alchemist must discover (perhaps through adventuring) the correct alchemical formula, including the required ingredients and their method of preparation. The resulting mixture then needed to be enchanted with the ''[[enchant an item]]'' [[spell]], and then subject to the special, high-powered spell known as ''[[hatch the stone from the egg]]'' (this was not the same as the alchemical formula). With this, the mixture was slowly transmuted into a ''philosopher's stone''. The final step was to make this last with a ''[[permanency]]''.\n\nOne item needed was the magical glass [[Wikipedia:retort|retort]] known as a ''[[philosopher's egg]]'', which aided in the making of mundane and magical liquids. It was because of this that mages said that \"the stone hatches from the egg\". It was itself the [[material component]] for ''hatch the stone from the egg'', but was not destroyed in the process. It held the alchemical mixture that would become the ''philosopher's stone''.\n\nRumor held that a ''[[king's tear]]'' was also somehow linked to the process, and to the creation of other magical items.",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1357 DR]], vast tracts of land in the [[Hills of Maerth]] in [[Chessenta]] were bought up by the famed [[archmage]] and [[planewalker]] [[Azurax Silverhawk]], who was searching for a ''philosopher's stone''.\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], after [[Khenel Barony]], the business-[[wizard]] of [[Waterdeep]], learned a local thieves' guild had come into possession of a ''philosopher's egg'', he orchestrated a takeover of the organization. He intended to use the ''egg'' to craft a ''philosopher's stone'' in order that he might \"revitalize the economy\", making himself extremely wealthy in the process.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|501|Khenel's Philosopher's Egg}}"
