'''Red Dragon Crush''' was a fine [[wine]] produced and distributed by the [[Wizard of Wines]] winery in [[Barovia]].

==Description==
The vintage was the finest non-sparkling wine produced by the winery. It had a tantalizing flavor.

==History==
The wine was produced by the [[Martikov]] family of [[wereravens]] and distributed for free to all villages in the valley of Barovia, together with the lesser [[Purple Grapemash No. 3]] wine. It was sold at the [[Blue Water Inn]] in [[Vallaki]] for 1 [[sp]] per {{SI|1|pt|l|long=yes}}.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], while the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] were trapped in Barovia, they were given a bottle of Red Dragon Crush by [[Adrian Martikov]] as thanks after having saved him from an ambush in the [[Svalich Woods]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}}{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3}}
