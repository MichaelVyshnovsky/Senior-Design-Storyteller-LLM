A ring of research was a magic ring that aided the wearer when conducting research.
These rings were made from gold or silver and were fixed with a single gemstone.
When worn, a ring of research allowed its wearer to quickly find the correct page in a book, or place on a scroll, where the answer to their question could be found provided they had access to a sufficient library that contained the knowledge they sought.
