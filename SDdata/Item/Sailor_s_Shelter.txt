The '''''Sailor's Shelter''''' was a simple in appearance, yet [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that helped seafaring folk remain fearless in the face of peril.

==Description==
The amulet was nothing but a worn knotted piece of rope with small beads made of [[coral]].

==Powers==
The ''Sailor's Shelter'' had almost palpable protective magics weaved into the rope's fibers. The wearer of his amulet was granted improved magical protection from fear and panic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Second Mate of Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] on board of the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' wore the ''Sailor's Shelter''. When the ship was damaged in a strange storm due to sabotage and was wrecked on the shores [[Samarach]] in [[Chult]], the Second Mate was captured by a cannibalistic [[Batiri]] of the [[Shattered Spear tribe]]. He was eager to offer the enchanted amulet to any mercenary brave enough to rescue the unfortunate man.
