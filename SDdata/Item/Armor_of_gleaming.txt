An armor of gleaming was a magically enchanted armor that was always spotlessly clean.
Any suit of medium armor, such as hide, chain shirts, scale armor, breastplates, and half plate, or even heavy armor such as ring, chain, splint, and plate mail, could be enchanted to become an armor of gleaming.
The enchantment present in an armor of gleaming ensured that it never became dirty.
