'''''Braehg''''' was a curative and intoxicating concoction prepared and imbibed by the [[Reghedmen]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

{{quote|''We take turns at swigging braehg. It'll put girth on your arms and fire in your loins, but a mouthful is enough to make any Townsman spill his guts â€“ hah! Up for it?''|[[Guthewulfe Henghelm]]}}

==Description==
To non-Reghed people, ''braehg'' was and unpalatably vile mixture of blood of a [[wild boar]], [[milk]], and several special [[herb]]s.

==Powers==
Consuming an entire flask of ''braehg'' was considered a challenge for its strong taste and intoxicating properties. However, the concoction possessed curative powers, acting as a potent antidote and gave them a burst of strength and energy if they could still stand. A single flask's effects lasted for around three hours.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, [[Guthewulfe Henghelm]], a [[Reghedmen]] trader often visiting [[Targos]], was eager to challenge locals to a ''braehg'' drinking contest, a feat not many could accomplish. Guthewulfe also sold flasks of the vile-tasting brew to willing customers.
