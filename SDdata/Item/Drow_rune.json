        "mainbody": "A '''''drow rune''''' was a defensive form of [[rune magic]] used by the [[drow]].",
        "Description": "Drow runes were elegant. They limned them with black material, often [[ink]], paste, or inlay.",
        "Powers": "Two versions of magical symbols existed. First, there were the ones enchanted with ''[[glyph of warding]]''. Second, there were the ones specifically created by drow [[runecaster]]s for specific locations with special spells developed only for this purpose.\n\nTheir magic was activated by one of three methods: by touching the rune, by movement of the surface they were placed upon&mdash;like opening a rune-rigged door&mdash;or by passing through a place that was connected to a rune. If they were made invisible, they visibly flashed on activation. Unlike a ''glyph of warding'' or ''[[greater glyph of warding]]'', a ''drow rune's'' powers were not expended on activation. However, there was a one-minute interval between successive activations.\n\nThey were hard to bypass. Both magical means like casting ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[remove traps]]'' or mundane means of which [[rogue]]s were capable had only a one in six chance of success. One in three times, they turned the rune inert for one to two minutes, and half the time, the meddling caused it to trigger even during the one-minute interval. Sure ways to safely bypass these runes were to cast ''[[antimagic shell]]'', being a priestess of [[Lolth]], or having a ''[[drow house insignia]]''. However, these were merely general rules.\n\nThere were a total three types of ''drow runes''. The ''[[way-marker rune]]s'', used in places the drow patrolled but did not inhabit; the ''[[sacred glyph]]s'', used in places sacred to Lolth; and the ''[[house defense glyph]]s'', used to defend houses.\n\nMagical runes of the drow used a special ink that was magical. The formulae of it was a secret known to the noble houses. The most powerful of these secret ink was one called ''[[everdark]]'' that made the magical effects stronger.",
        "History": "Drow in general had an aptitude for glyphs and runes and by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], their history of using rune magic to protect specific locations was very old.",
        "Notable Owners": "Only the richest and most powerful among the drow could afford to use ''drow runes''."
