        "mainbody": "The Dual Ring of Velsharoons Bindings was one of the twelve Qysari Rings made for the rulers of the Shoon Imperium. It gave the wearer protection against the undead and increased resistance to necromantic spells. Copies of this magical jewelry were known to exist but the shortened name ring of Velsharoons Binding was commonly used to describe them.\nThis \"ring\" was actually two rings joined by a fine silver chain, forming one piece of jewelry intended to be worn on the index and pinky (smallest) fingers of one hand. Magic rings made during the sixth age of Calimshan (27 â€“ 450 DR) were constructed of twisted bands of two different metals and were known as shoonrings. What distinguished the Qysari Ring from an ordinary shoonring copy was that the aesthetic form of the two bands changed depending on the nature of the person wearing them. When placed on the fingers of a cleric, druid, or other priest, the direction of the metal weave turned at right angles to the circumference of the rings. If donned by warriors or rogues, the raised patterns became smooth to the touch but still visible. Wizards saw no change in the design when it was placed on their hand.\nWhen both bands of this \"ring\" were donned, the wearer was surrounded by an invisible barrier that prevented physical entry by undead creatures. The protection extended out to a radius of 5 ft (1.5 m) centered on the wearer, but anyone or anything within the circle was also protected. There was a limit to how many undead could be repelled at once. It took the equivalent of thirty-six skeletons, eighteen zombies, nine ghasts, or five vampires`to breech the barrier.\nThe wearer was also granted significantly increased resistance to all spells from the school of necromancy.\nThis ring was commissioned by Qysara Shoon V who ruled from the Year of the Weeping Flail, 281 DR, to the Year of the Late Sun, 300 DR. She was known to have a phobia about the undead. This ring was presumably handed down to her successors, but its chain of custody has been lost to history."
