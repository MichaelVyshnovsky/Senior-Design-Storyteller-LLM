'''''Phase potions''''' were a type of [[magic]]al [[potion]] similar in nature to [[oil of etherealness|''oils of etherealness'']].

==Powers==
As their name suggested, ''phase potions'' temporarily granted their imbibers an imitation of a [[phase spider]]'s ability to shift their bodies in and out of phase between the [[Prime Material]] and the [[Ethereal plane]], making them otherwise impervious to harm on the former by all but those who could reach into the Ethereal plane themselves. The imbiber was also able to phase out with them up to {{SI|60|lb|k}} of material matter. Objects could be taken without any issue, though living creatures could resist against the effect.

The effective length of a ''phase potion's'' effects was anywhere from around 8 to 40 minutes. And whilst an imbiber's body was in phase with the Prime Material, a trace of the ''phase potion's'' [[portal]] to the Ethereal plane was visible in the form of a fiery nimbus of white fire surrounding them.

Notably, the [[spell]] ''[[phase door]]'' interfered with the effects of ''phase potions'', forcing their imbiber to remain in phase with the Prime Material for a period of seven minutes.

==Creation==
Creating a ''phase potion'' required either the blood of a phase spider or the concentrated juices of a rare{{Cite dungeon/20/The Ship of Night|24}}
