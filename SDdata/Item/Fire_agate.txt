Fire agate was a form of chalcedony which contained goethite arranged in thin lines, giving this stone an iridescent quality.
These ornamental stones came in red, brown, gold, and green varieties and in the finest specimens the chalcedony was partially translucent, allowing the color to come through. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.
Fire agates were used in creating the most potent base for potions of fire resistance by dissolving them in fire lizard or pyrolisk blood.
