Shatterbolt was gnome-constructed heavy crossbow crafted out of a treants heart and unicorn hair.
Shatterbolt was a masterfully crafted weapon that possessed a +2 enchantment and dealt massive critical damage to its targets.
Shatterbolt was created by an unnamed but skilled gnome bowyer who impressed everyone, even himself with the construction of this heavy crossbow. He organized an event to show the device off to his fellow gnomes, where he continuously shot Shatterbolt at target barrels, making them explode into splinters with each hit. Unfortunately for the events attendees, the barrels were filled with water and showered them after each explosive presentation. One of the attendees was a half-orc bounty hunter, who was not amused by the water-soaked annoyance.
After the show was over, the bounty hunter followed the gnome bowyer home and murdered him with just one hit of her handaxe, ending the gnomes career as an inventor and entertainer. She claimed Shatterbolt for herself.
By 1372 DR, Shatterbolt had found its way to Daggerford where it was among the stock of Dervals Bright Blade, the local smith shop that belonged to Derval Ironeater.
