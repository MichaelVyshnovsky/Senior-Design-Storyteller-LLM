Tempusfugue was an enchanted sentient broadsword located in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
In addition to making it slightly easier for its wielder to strike and harm an opponent, Tempusfugue could detect magic twice per day. 
The sword was carried by Baergon Bluesword, a warrior and cleric of Tempus.
