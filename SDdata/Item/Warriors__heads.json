        "mainbody": "'''Warriors' heads''' were a common dish from the nation of [[Amn]] in [[West Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "Warriors' heads was a dish served in a [[bowl]] in which baked [[garlic]] heads were drenched in [[olive oil]]. Around it was a wall of twelve types of [[pickle]]s. Some were sweet and hot, others were [[salt]]y, and some were mixed with pitted [[date]]s. Warriors' heads were to be picked and tasted a lot and often.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], travelers from outside of Amn were advised to learn the name of the dish to avoid any confusion. One of the places that served warriors' heads was [[The Battlescarred Bard]] inn on the [[Trade Way]] in Amn."
