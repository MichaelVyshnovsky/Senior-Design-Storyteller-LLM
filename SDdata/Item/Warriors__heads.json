Around it was a wall of twelve types of pickles. Some were sweet and hot, others were salty, and some were mixed with pitted dates. Warriors heads were to be picked and tasted a lot and often.\nBy the late 14 century DR, travelers from outside of Amn were advised to learn the name of the dish to avoid any confusion. One of the places that served warriors heads was The Battlescarred Bard inn on the Trade Way in Amn."
