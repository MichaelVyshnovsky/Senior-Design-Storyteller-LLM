A '''ballista''' ({{Pronounce|ba|LIST|a|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|25}}|audio=Ballista.ogg}}, {{Plural|ballistae}} {{variant|ballistas|alt=yes}}{{Cite dragon/169/Editorial: The answers (sort of) at last!|6}}) was a large ranged weapon typically used to lay siege to a fortified structure, but it was also used to defend such redoubts.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|70}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 55: Kh√¥ltar, Part 6, Looking Around the Farrgaunlar}} They were also mounted on ships for naval combat as well as on [[spelljammer]]s for battles in space.

==Description==
Ballistae were essentially large, heavy [[crossbow]]s that were mounted on something sturdy that could withstand the force needed to load and shoot the weapon. They could be mounted on heavy [[cart]]s or [[wagon]]s, sturdy walls, buildings, or on the decks of ships, for example. Ballistae fired heavy bolts similar to a crossbow but on a large scale.

The rate of fire of a ballista was relatively slow because it took considerable effort to load and aim the weapon. People of medium and smaller stature were at a particular disadvantage. Large creatures could usually operate a ballista more proficiently.

==Variants==
For the outfitting of spelljamming ships, light, medium and heavy ballistae were available. They were successively bigger and did greater harm, but also slower and lesser in range.
