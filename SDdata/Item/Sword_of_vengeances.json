        "mainbody": "The '''''sword of vengeances''''' was the enchanted [[longsword]] wielded by [[Bronwyn]], the [[elf|elven]] [[Ranger]] ally of the [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire]].",
        "Powers": "Bronwyn's ''sword of vengeances'' possessed a ''+3'' enchantment. It was magically conditioned to deal significantly more damage and be more effective when battling evil creatures. Additionally, the blade improved the wielder's constitution at a price of wisdom loss.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the ''sword of vengeances'' accompanied its mistress on her mission, leading agents of the Sisterhood of Silver Fire to investigate their goddess' call to arms. After they reached [[Myth Drannor]], Bronwyn and surviving sister, [[Kellan]], were captured by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The ''sword of vengeances'' returned to Bronwyn's hands after being rescued by the [[Veiled Ones]]."
