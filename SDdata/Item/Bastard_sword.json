        "mainbody": "Bastard swords were a type of sword that fell in-between longswords and greatswords.\nBastard swords had a longer grip than a one-handed sword and a shorter blade than a greatsword for extra precision in the strike. It was also more powerful than a longsword due to its increased weight.\nBastard swords were martial weapons normally used two-handed, but could also be wielded with just one. Though they required extra training to use effectively with a single hand.\nBastard swords first became available in the Netheril Empire in .\n* Fatal Touch, the bastard sword of Kelemvor.\n* Ever Watchful / Vindicator, the bastard sword of Helm, Gedrin Thalavar and Kalen Dren.\n* The Moonsword of Eilistraee.\n* The acidic burst bastard sword of Grazzt.\n* Keryvian,Â one of the Baneblades of Demron, believed to be the most powerful."
