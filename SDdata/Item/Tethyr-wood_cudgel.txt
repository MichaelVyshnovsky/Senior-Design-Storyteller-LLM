Tethyr-wood cudgels were rare elven-made enchanted clubs from the Forest of Tethir.
These clubs possessed +2 enchantments and dealt additional acid damage to its targets.
Even though tress in the Forest of Tethir was not tolerated by druids and the elven population, occasionally, certain individuals received gifts of permission to claim a small part of nature for themselves. One particular sect of friendly druids received special boons for their work protecting the lush greenery of Tethyr, sometimes these boons included elven crafted weapons like Tethyr-wood cudgels.
In 1374 DR, one of these rare bludgeons made its way into the Market Triangle of Westgate.
