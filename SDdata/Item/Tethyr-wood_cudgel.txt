'''''Tethyr-wood cudgels''''' were rare [[elf|elven]]-made [[enchanted]] [[club]]s from the [[Forest of Tethir]].

==Powers==
These clubs possessed ''+2'' enchantments and dealt additional [[acid]] damage to its targets.

==History==
Even though tress in the Forest of Tethir was not tolerated by [[druid]]s and the elven population, occasionally, certain individuals received gifts of permission to claim a small part of nature for themselves. One particular sect of friendly druids received special boons for their work protecting the lush greenery of [[Tethyr]], sometimes these boons included elven crafted weapons like ''Tethyr-wood cudgels''.

In 1374 DR, one of these rare bludgeons made its way into the Market Triangle of [[Westgate]].
