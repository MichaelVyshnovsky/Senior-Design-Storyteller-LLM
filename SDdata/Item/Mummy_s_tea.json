It was known to have a foul odor.\nCreation of this potion required boiling the used wrappings of a mummy alongside animal bones that had been naturally dried out.\nAnyone who consumed this potion would experience effects similar to the spells cure blindness or deafness and cure disease.\nMummys tea was first developed in Mulhorand by priests of Horus-Re. By 1281 DR, it was available for purchase from a number of vendors in the region of Icewind Dale."
