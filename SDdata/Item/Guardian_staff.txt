'''''Guardian staves''''' were magic [[staves]] that possessed offensive and defensive [[enchantment]]s, in use in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Guardian staves'' were ancient weapons with souls of once-great [[warrior]]s bound to them. They possessed ''+1'' and ''+2'' enchantments that guided the wielder's hands towards the targets and made attacks more deadly and, at the same time, granted magical protection to the wielder. They also slightly increased their [[spell]] damage and fortified their will and physique.

==History==
Several of the ''guardian staves'' found use in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and the nearby [[Crags]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
