Gloves of concentration were magical items that aided the wearers spellcasting.
Gloves of concentration appeared fairly mundane, well-made gloved oof brown leather.
Gloves of concentration generally came in three power levels, regular, greater, and epic. All three types had an enchantment that increased the wearers concentration skill, regular increased it only slightly, as the epic - increased it dramatically.
The first pair of the gloves of concentration was created by a wizard Beregost Hamish who noticed his ability to concentrate on complex spells was diminishing with age. He created these gloves as a tool to help relax his mind, allowing him to be able to easily cast spells even in dangerous situations. Eventually, he died of old age, but not before making a fortune by selling the gloves to his fellow spellcasters.
