A'''ring of spellbattle''', also called a '''''spellbattle ring''''', was a magic [[ring]] that gave its wearer the ability to dispel certain spells. 

==Description==
It was a [[gold]] ring inset with [[silver]] spheres.

==Effects==
Its wearer immediately became aware of any use of, and the nature of, magical [[spell]]s, powers, or [[psionics]] within 120 feet (40 meters) or 60 feet (20 meters). If the wearer knew spellcraft, it was possible that he or she could identify the spell, even if he or she could not see it at all.

He or she could then choose to dispel it as if with ''[[dispel magic]]'' as a counterspell, or else change the target of the spell, once per day, but only to new targets within 60 feet (20 meters). Otherwise the redirection failed.

The ring also granted the wearer the ability to affect spells that were activated by a ''[[spell trigger]]'' or similar mechanism, but did not affect discharges or [[psionics]] from [[magic item]]s.

==Notable Rings of Spellbattle==
A ring like this was possessed by [[Ahbhaer Mhilshoun]].
