The '''''Ring of Murbrand''''' was a magical [[ring]].

==Appearance==
It gleamed, and had runes.

==Powers==
Presumably, the ring required a powerful wielder to call upon its powers at all.

==History==
The ring was retrieved from the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] by [[Tarth Hornwood]], who found it in the finger of a corpse then down to its bones, crushed by a stray boulder. He tried to use it to pay for [[Elminster]]'s tutoring in the Art, but was rejected.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|227-230|15}}
