The Ring of Murbrand was a magical ring.
It gleamed, and had runes.
Presumably, the ring required a powerful wielder to call upon its powers at all.
The ring was retrieved from the ruins of Myth Drannor by Tarth Hornwood, who found it in the finger of a corpse then down to its bones, crushed by a stray boulder. He tried to use it to pay for Elminsters tutoring in the Art, but was rejected.
