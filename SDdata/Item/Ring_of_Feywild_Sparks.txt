A '''''ring of Feywild Sparks''''' was a rare [[enchanted]] piece of jewelry that boosted a [[wild mage]]'s magical abilities.

==Powers==
Despite the [[ring]]'s mundane appearance, it connected the wearer with the sporadic bursts of magic of the [[Feywild]]. Its ''Feywild Sparks'' enchantment allowed a [[wild magic]] [[sorcerer]] to turn every one of their spells into wild magic as long as their ''[[tides of chaos]]'' ability was active.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''ring of Feywild Sparks'' belonged to the malicious [[green hag]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] named [[Auntie Ethel]]. The ring was stashed in her underground lair under the [[Blushing Maiden Inn]] in the [[Lower City]].
