'''Berduskan Dark''' was a wine exported from [[Berdusk]] and sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].

==Description==
This heavy wine was dark and sweet with a slight burning aftertaste. Possessed of a high alcohol content, this wine was eagerly sought throughout the Realms.

At one point this wine was bottled thanks to cooperation between guilds in Berdusk. However, a falling out between the Vinter's and Alchemists guilds ended the bottling process.

Dry Berduskan was said to pair well with a dish of [[Tharsult]]an [[prawn]]s cooked with [[plover]]'s eggs in [[garlic butter]].{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}

* Hand keg (14 gp)
