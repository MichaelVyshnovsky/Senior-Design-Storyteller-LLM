        "mainbody": "Elixirs of the colossus were magic potions that temporarily increased the imbibers size.\nWhen one such potion was consumed, the imbibers abdomen swelled and muscles steeled as their body grew in size. This enlarged form possessed an impressively increased strength. However, the potions effects faded if another elixir was consumed or the imbiber took a rest of at least eight hours.\nOne recipes for the elixir of the colossus required a mixture of salts of chasm creeper to be mixed with a certain type of alchemical suspension.\n*Arron, a halfling druid trader from the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR."
