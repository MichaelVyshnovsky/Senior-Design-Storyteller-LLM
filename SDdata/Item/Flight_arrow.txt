'''Flight arrows''' were [[arrow]]s that, as the name implied, were designed with range in mind. They were often used when hunting.

==Description==
Flight arrows were lighter compared to "common" arrows. They were usually made from [[birch]] or [[ash]] trees and measured between {{SI|30|"|c|long=yes}} and {{SI|40|"|c|long=yes}} in length.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Catti-brie]]'s ''[[Quiver of Anariel]]'' contained twenty alchemical silver flight arrows.
