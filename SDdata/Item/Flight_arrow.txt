Flight arrows were arrows that, as the name implied, were designed with range in mind. They were often used when hunting.
Flight arrows were lighter compared to "common" arrows. They were usually made from birch or ash trees and measured between  and  in length.
* Catti-bries Quiver of Anariel contained twenty alchemical silver flight arrows.
