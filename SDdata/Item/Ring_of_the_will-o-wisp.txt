The '''''Ring of the will-o-wisp''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] created by a [[Silvanite]] [[druid]] [[Eimhec]] sometime before [[1281 DR]].

==Description==
The ''ring of the will-o-wisp'' was a [[brass]] piece of jewelry with a piece of [[mandrake]] impeded in place of a [[gem]].

==Powers==
The wearer of the ring could tap into its magics to summon a spray of magical motes of light that stung anyone caught within its {{SI|12'|'"|long=yes}} cone. The enchantment could be activated once per day.

==History==
Long before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the ''ring of the will-o-wisp'' was created by Eimhec of [[Silvanus]] in order to give some protection to his underlings. The individual known as [[Omad the Wise]] was the ring's first known owner. He was believed to have kept the ring until reaching the title of the [[archdruid]]. The item next was passed along to [[Jontan Dunmoss]], who was murdered and robbed by a gang of [[Malarite]] cultists who kept the ring for several years. Finally, [[Hunter Renard]], the Malarite owner, was sniped dead by [[elf|elven]] sharpshooters somewhere in the northern woods of [[Faer√ªn]].

In 1281 DR, the ''ring of the will-o-wisp'' was found in the Field of Bones of the [[White Wyrm Iceberg]] deep in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The glacier served as the [[undead]] [[white dragon]] [[Icasaracht]]'s lair.
