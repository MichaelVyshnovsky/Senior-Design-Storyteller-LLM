        "mainbody": "A '''''gal-ralan''''' was a [[cold iron]] armband with long needles on the interior. It was worn by [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadow fey]] to negate the effects of their shadow curse. It did this by nailing together the shadar-kai's body and soul; however, it also caused constant pain to its wearer.",
        "Description": "The armband was decorated with designs that were abstract and elaborate. The needles inside were 6 inches (15.24 cm) long.",
        "Crafting": "A ''gal-ralan'' was forged of [[cold iron]] by a spellcaster who knew the ''[[resistance]]'' spell and the art of crafting wondrous items. A more powerful spellcaster could craft a more effective ''gal-ralan''.",
        "Powers": "When worn as a bracer or armband, the long needles of the ''gal-ralan'' pierced the forearm. Naturally, this caused constant pain and injury to the wearer, which could never be healed whilst it remained in place. The benefit was that it fixed the soul to the body, granting greater resistance to all effects that would harm body or mind. It was more effective against [[death magic]], the draining of life energy, and anything that attacked one's soul. This included the shadow curse that afflicted all shadar-kai and dragged their souls back to the [[Shadow Plane]].",
        "Users": "Many shadar-kai who ventured off the Shadow Plane chose to wear a ''gal-ralan'' to protect themselves from the shadow curse.",
        "History": "''Gal-ralans'' were worn by the shadar-kai involved in [[Despayr]]'s plot to tear a hole in the [[Weave]] in the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. Notable wearers were Kithguard [[Maurran]] and Kithlord [[Thieraven]], who were stationed at the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]], and the boatman [[Sithierel]], who plied the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the Plane of Shadow."
