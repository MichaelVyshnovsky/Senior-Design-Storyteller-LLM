Anarchic was a weapon quality that could be added to any weapon. Infused with chaos, the weapon became chaotically aligned and inflicted more damage to creatures of lawful alignment. Any lawful creature wielding an anarchic weapon would be weakened.
The creator of an anarchic weapon had to be chaotic and know the spell chaos hammer.
Some veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as anarchic weapons.
