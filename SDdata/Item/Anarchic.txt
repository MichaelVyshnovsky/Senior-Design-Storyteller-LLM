'''''Anarchic''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that could be added to any weapon. Infused with [[chaos]], the weapon became chaotically aligned and inflicted more damage to creatures of [[lawful]] alignment. Any lawful creature wielding an ''anarchic'' weapon would be weakened.

==Creation==
The creator of an anarchic weapon had to be chaotic and know the spell ''[[chaos hammer]]''.

==Uses==
Some veteran [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ''anarchic'' weapons. 

==Notable Anarchic Weapons==
* ''[[Razor's Edge]]'', the personal weapon of the strife god [[Cyric]], was a ''+5 anarchic [[keen]] [[screaming]] [[wounding]] [[longsword]]''.
* The ''[[Sword of Shadows]]'', the personal weapon of the traveler god [[Shaundakul]], was a ''+5 anarchic [[icy burst]] [[keen]] [[greatsword]]''.
* ''[[Battle Prowess]]'', the personal weapon of the war god [[Tempus]], was a ''+3 anarchic [[keen]] [[speed]] [[battleaxe]]''.
