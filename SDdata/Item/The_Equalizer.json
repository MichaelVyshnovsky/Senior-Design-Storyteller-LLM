        "mainbody": "The Equalizer, also known as the sword of neutrality, was an enchanted longsword that was created to fight creatures of moral extremes.\nThe Equalizers three notable parts were its blade, hilt, and pommel. The swords blade became two-pronged at its end, making it similar to a swordbreaker in design. Its hilt was intricately designed, and the pommel held a large blue gemstone.\nThis unique sword was said to had been forged to balance the powers of the universe and, as such, it possessed an enchantment that became more powerful the further the swords target was from the balanced neutral nature. When wielded against creatures of absolute chaos and evil, as well as creatures of law and order, The Equalizer became a crippling +6 enchanted weapon, while when used against a truly neutral creature, it was nothing but a mundane blade.\nThe Equalizers origin was largely forgotten. It was believed to be an ancient weapon forged by the worshipers of Helm, if markings on the swords hilt were to be believed, in order to uphold balance and to shift the universe towards harmonious equilibrium. Before the 14 century DR, The Equalizers last known wielder was Alaine Greenleaf, an elven hero who was lost in the Underdark. This was where the sword was likely broken into three parts. Its pommel gem was taken to the surface by an escaped slave. Its blade was last seen in the lair of a powerful elder orb underneath Amn, and the hilt in a nearby illithid colony.\nEventually, in the , the gemstone ended up in the possession of the cruel archmage Jon Irenicus in Athkatla. Some claimed that Abdel Adrian collected all parts of the blade and commissioned its reforging with the dwarven blacksmith Cromwell."
