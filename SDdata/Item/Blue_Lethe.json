        "mainbody": "'''Blue Lethe''' was an ancient [[Netherese]] drink enjoyed by [[dwarves]] and some [[elves]].",
        "Description": "Blue Lethe was bright blue in color, and it refracted light, making it appear as if the liquid radiated a gentle glow. The drink was slightly opaque. Blue Lethe was pleasantly sweet and nutritious. One could use the drink as a food substitute without ill effects for an entire [[tenday]].\n\nThe name \"Blue Lethe\" was given to the drink by dwarves. It was named such for its color and for inducing short-term memory blackouts when dwarves drank a bit too much, after the [[River Lethe]], the River of Forgetfulness that flowed through the [[planes]].\n\nThis striking-looking alcohol was created using juice from at least three types of berries. One of them was mixed with a certain type of forest plant sap, fermented, and altered through magical means. Its rarity and almost addictive taste were always highly prized and sought after.",
        "History": "The secret of making Blue Lethe was presumed lost with the destruction of ancient Netheril. All who knew how to create the drink perished as the floating cities plummeted to earth. However, some elves of ancient [[Myth Drannor]] managed to recreate the recipe through long and arduous experimentation. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Blue Lethe was considered extremely rare, and on occasion, casks of seemingly eternal alcohol could be uncovered in Netherese tombs and burial chambers. Elven-brewed Blue Lethe's production was kept a secret, with the [[barrel]]s of the drink being sold and re-sold through intermediaries under claims of it being a genuine Netherese libation taken from a crypt."
