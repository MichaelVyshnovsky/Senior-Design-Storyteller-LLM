        "mainbody": "otions of animal friendship were magical potions that temporarily granted the power to befriend animals.\nUpon inspection, the liquid that composed a potion of animal friendship looked muddy. Agitating the fluid brought small animal bits into view, such as scales, cat claws, squirrel hairs, or bird tongues.\nUpon drinking a potion of animal friendship, the user gained the power to cast the animal friendship spell, as many times as desired, for one hour.\nIn the late 15 century DR, potions of animal friendship were sold at Corellons Crown, an herbalism shop in Trollskull Alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep, run by the wood elf Fala Lefaliir."
