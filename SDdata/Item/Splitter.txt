Splitter was a +5 keen superior dispelling greatsword wielded by Ryld Argith, a drow master of Melee-Magthere in Menzoberranzan.
Splitter could cut through nearly anything. It also dispelled magic with a successful hit.
Ryld liked to attend to his sword, having convinced himself that the sword (though non-sentient) appreciated it.
The greatsword was broken when Jeggred Baenre killed Ryld in 1373 DR.
Superior Dispelling A superior dispelling weapon allows the wielder to use dispel magic as a standard action in a 5-foot radius centered on the wielder. The item grants only the use of the area dispel function of the spell, not the targeted dispel or counterspell functions.
