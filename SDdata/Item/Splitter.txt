'''''Splitter''''' was a +''5 [[keen]] [[Dispel magic|superior dispelling]]'' [[greatsword]] wielded by [[Ryld Argith]], a [[drow]] master of [[Melee-Magthere]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].

''Splitter'' could cut through nearly anything. It also dispelled magic with a successful hit.

Ryld liked to attend to his sword, having convinced himself that the sword (though non-sentient) appreciated it.

The greatsword was broken when [[Jeggred Baenre]] killed Ryld in [[1373 DR]].

== Powers ==
'''Superior Dispelling''': A superior dispelling weapon allows the wielder to use ''[[dispel magic]]'' as a standard action in a 5-foot radius centered on the wielder. The item grants only the use of the area dispel function of the spell, not the targeted dispel or counterspell functions.
