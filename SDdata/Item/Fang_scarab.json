        "mainbody": "A '''''fang scarab''''' was a medallion that gave any [[spider]] that wore it the ability to hear the dark whispers of [[Lolth]] and guide it in battle. However, any non-spider who wore the medallion found it would fuse to their neck and slowly transform them into a half-spider creature.",
        "Description": "Made of crystal and shaped like a fang, a ''fang scarab'' typically hung from a finely crafted [[silver]] chain. The chain was designed to fit over a [[spider]]'s head and body.",
        "Creation": "They were crafted almost exclusively by worshipers of [[Lolth]] for their [[spider]] servants. However, occasionally a ''fang scarab'' fell into the hands of overly curious [[rogues]] or [[bards]].",
        "Powers": "The ''fang scarab'' granted its wearer access to the insidious whispers of [[Lolth]], which would help to guide it in the midst of battle. However, as this item was primarily designed for [[spider]]s, it would only function for non-spiders if they could somehow unlock its secrets and fuse the scarab to their neck.\n\nThough the whispers of Lolth could still aid non-spiders, the process of fusing the scarab to their neck exacted a horrific price as they were transformed into a deformed spider-like creature. Those non-spiders who took up the path of a [[fang of lolth]] could gain even greater powers through the whispers of Lolth, though only by further changes to their body.",
        "History": "During the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], the whispers that emanated from ''fang scarabs'' ceased. The quietening of [[Lolth]]'s whispers rendered many of the powers of the ''fang scarabs'' and the fangs of Lolth inert.",
