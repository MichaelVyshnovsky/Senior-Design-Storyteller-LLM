        "mainbody": "A mail coif, also known as a chain coif or simply a coif, was a padded chainmail hood that usually came either with or built into chainmail or some other form of mail-based armor.\nThe mail coif was snugly draped over the neck, shoulders, and head of the wearer, leaving only the face exposed. The protection it offered wasnt substantial, especially against impact weapons, and so it was typically worn beneath some form of helmet, such as the great helm worn by many knights.\n* The devils known as merregons often wore mail hoods alongside studded leather armor.\n* Some adventuring Sunite clerics wore mail hoods alongside chainmail."
