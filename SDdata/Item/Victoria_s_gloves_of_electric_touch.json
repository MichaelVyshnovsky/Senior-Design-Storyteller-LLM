        "mainbody": "Victorias gloves of electric touch were a pair of unique enchanted elven gloves that once belonged to an AkhVelahr war party leader, Victoria, who died in the Weeping War.\nVictorias gloves of electric touch were elbow-length leather gloves.\nThese magic gloves held the enchantment that increased the wearers strength and willpower. Additionally, they allowed the wearer to cast the shocking grasp spell at will. These gloves held at least three charges of the spell.\nDuring the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading Army of Darkness and met her demise in the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the drow of House Freth were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victorias gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. Victorias gloves of electric touch never reached the Underdark as a group of adventurers from Phlan destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
