The '''''Greatsword of Impiltur''''' was the fabled state [[weapon]] of [[Impiltur]]. It had a storied history in [[Faerûn]], spanning several hundred years. It served as King [[Halantar I|Halantar's]] ceremonial [[sword]] for twenty-five years, until it went missing and traveled throughout the Realms.

==Description==
Forged from [[cold iron]], the blade of the sword was engraved with images of dead and screaming [[demon]]s and crackled with lightning-like dark energies. Its pommel and guard appeared as if the blade had impaled a [[balor]].

==Powers==
The ''+3 [[ravenous (weapon quality)|ravenous]] [[Doomstrike (weapon quality)|doomstrike]] [[greatsword]]'' would ''[[daze]]'' those who were struck by its blows.

==Creation==
The [[spell]]s ''[[shatter]]'' and ''[[slay living]]'' were used in the sword's creation.

==History==
The ''Greatsword of Impiltur'' was commissioned in [[732 DR]] to commemorate the coronation of [[Sarshel Elethim]] as King of the Realm of the Sword and the Wand,<ref name=tGHotR-p101> though it was not completed by the [[dwarves]] of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] until [[734 DR|two years later]] under the reign of Halanter I. The king wielded the blade for a quarter of a century until it was stolen from the royal vaults in the [[759 DR|Year of the Missing Blade, 759 DR]]. While it was believed to be among a cache of weapons and treasures stolen by agents of the balor [[Ndulu]], it was not found among the rest of the lost riches following the [[Battle of Moaning Gorge]].

In the middle of the winter of [[826 DR]], [[Eljak Farenfal]] was hunting a pack of [[winter wolves]] across the frozen [[Bluefang Water]], when he found lost blade of Impiltur in the scabbard of a [[Rashemaar berserker]]. At the end of the winter season, Eljak returned the greatsword, along with the pelt of an alpha winter wolf, to King [[Halanter II]], and received the monarch's sincere gratitude.

The stately sword remained in its home nation for one hundred years, until it was transported aboard the ship ''[[Nadyra's Glory]]'', along with other Impilturan treasures, as Princess [[Aliia Elethlim]] sailed to the Forest Nation of [[Cormyr]] to marry [[Rhiigard I|Crown Prince Rhiigard]] in [[926 DR]]. Unfortunately, the ship was destroyed by the [[succubus]] [[Soneillon]], taking Princess Aliia's life and sinking Impiltur's riches along with the greatsword.<ref>

The blade was recovered from the [[Inner Sea]] by Sonellion, along with the couple's ''coronation crowns'', and returned to her [[fiend]]ish court beneath the [[Giantspire Mountains]]. After lending the greatsword to a select few of her [[hobgoblin]] champions, she passed the fabled blade to her consort, the fallen prince of Impiltur [[Imbrar I|Imbrar the Lost]] after his resurrection and conversion into a [[death knight]].

During the [[Spellplague]] after [[1385 DR]], Soneillon and Imbrar were torn from the world of [[Toril]] and the ''Greatsword of Impiltur'' remained on its soil. It was believed to have been recovered by yet another of the succubus' champion hobgoblins.
