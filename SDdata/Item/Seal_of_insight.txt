The '''''seal of insight''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] trinket crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Vajra Safahr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''seal of insight'' was a metal weight that Vajra kept in her traveling pouch of [[material component]]s and reagents. She used it for precise weight measurements in her [[arcane]] experiments.

==Powers==
Merely having the ''seal of insight'' on her person improved Vajra's ability to assess and take advantage of both her experiments and her enemies.

==Notable Owners==
* Vajra Safahr, the [[Blackstaff]] of Waterdeep in the late 15{{th}} century DR, to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[rod of favorable inclination]]''.
