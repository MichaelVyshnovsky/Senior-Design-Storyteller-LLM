The seal of insight was a unique enchanted trinket crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Vajra Safahr in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
The seal of insight was a metal weight that Vajra kept in her traveling pouch of material components and reagents. She used it for precise weight measurements in her arcane experiments.
Merely having the seal of insight on her person improved Vajras ability to assess and take advantage of both her experiments and her enemies.
