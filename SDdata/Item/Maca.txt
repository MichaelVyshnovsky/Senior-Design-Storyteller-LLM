A maca was a Maztican club, and Tethyr.
Macas were weapons shaped like elongated paddles of hard wood, wide and flat "blades" with razor sharp shards of obsidian lodged into their edges. They functioned as both bludgeoning and slashing weapons.
Although the maca was a fearsome weapon when used against Maztican warriors, they were no match for Amnnian steel.
According to the creation myth of Maztica, Kukul, an elder deity, sliced off his fingers with a maca. The fingers transformed into the first humans of the Maztican continent. Later, the clues deity of warfare – Zaltec, used a maca to kill his mother – goddess Maztica, the continents namesake.
Macas became common used weapons in the Golden Age of Payit, following the development of Maztican military. A maca was also instrumental in ending the Golden Age of Payit. Aliah, the most beautiful princess of Payit was abducted by Tacal, prince of Tulom-Itzi, and beheaded in a fit of rage by his maca club. This tragedy was the true end of the countrys Golden Age.
