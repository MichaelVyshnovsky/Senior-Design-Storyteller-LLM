'''''The Sturdy Feet of Pim''''' were unique [[enchanted]] [[boot]]s once worn by a [[hin]] hero named [[Pim Pebblefoot]] of the [[Gray Hills]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].

==Powers==
The wearer of these sturdy boots was magically protected from being knocked over. Additionally, their enchantments increased the wearer's vitality. ''The Sturdy Feet of Pim'' were enchanted to only a [[fighter]] could wear them.

==History==
Pim Pebblefoot proudly wore these boots though his long heroic career until his death at the age of 135 years. On his feet, these boots accompanied Pim through defending his home village from evildoers, countless patrols through good and foul weather, fighting [[orc]] hordes as a member of the [[Knights in Silver]], and scaring [[giant]]s from the [[Evermoors]]. After Pim Pebblefoot's death sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''The Sturdy Feet of Pim'' were claimed by his great-nephew, an aspiring adventurer named [[Prand Pebblefoot]]. Last the boots were seen was with Prand on their way to the city of [[Neverwinter]].

It was unknown what happened to Prand Pebblefoot or how the boots left his possessions, but by 1374 DR, [[Dayne Lynneth]], a merchant in the [[Blacklake District]] had them in her special inventory available to those friends of merchants and the goddess of commerce [[Waukeen]].
