        "mainbody": "A crown of scholarship was an enchanted hat worn by scholars and wizards. It could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR, and specifically within Blackstaff Academy.\nA \"crown\" was a regal scholars cap with gold trim.\nWearing a crown of scholarship enhanced ones ability to study mysteries and tackle arcane challenges. In combat, it was said to be usable by wizards to help them or their allies deduce the best way to strike at foes as well as how to conceal their own strengths.\n* Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR, was said to don a crown of scholarship whenever she got excited about a new intriguing question."
