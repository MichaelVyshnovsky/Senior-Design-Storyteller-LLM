'''''Brawler's belts''''' were [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s created by the members of the [[Order of the Dark Moon]] to improve their deadly hand-to-hand combat abilities.

==Powers==
There were two types of these belts: regular ''brawler's belts'' and much more powerful ''greater brawler's belts''. Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from bludgeoning damage; however, the greater versions of these belts were significantly more potent.

==History==
''Brawler's belts'' were created by the Dark Moon sect to give its members an unfair advantage over other monastic orders in the annual hand-to-hand combat challenges. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the [[Sword Coast]], being found in [[Neverwinter]]'s shops and around adventurers' waists, as well as in the temples of [[Hillsfar]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Dela Nereth]], a black market merchant of the [[Bloodsailors]] of [[Neverwinter]] in [[1372 DR]].
