Brawlers belts were enchanted belts created by the members of the Order of the Dark Moon to improve their deadly hand-to-hand combat abilities.
There were two types of these belts regular brawlers belts and much more powerful greater brawlers belts. Both types were enchanted to shield their wearers from bludgeoning damage however, the greater versions of these belts were significantly more potent.
Brawlers belts were created by the Dark Moon sect to give its members an unfair advantage over other monastic orders in the annual hand-to-hand combat challenges. By the late 14 century DR, there were quite a few of these enchanted belts scattered around the Sword Coast, being found in Neverwinters shops and around adventurers waists, as well as in the temples of Hillsfar.
