The Mace of Weal and Woe was an enchanted mace of mysterious origins, useful against creatures that venerated law.
This mace was masterfully crafted and could fetch a hefty price even if it were not enchanted. The maces brozne shaft was a cylinder filled with a reinforcing steel center. On the outside of the shaft were six bands of shiny polished steel, three above the haft and three below. Unlike many other maces, this weapon was topped with a stained cherrywood egg-shaped head, reinforced with bronze bands. The maces flanges were made out of steel and were specked asymmetrically over the head. The two of the biggest flanges were impeded on the opposite sides of the weapon. One was decorated with an engraving of the goddess Tymora and the word "weal" written in Thorass. The other - decorated with an image of Beshaba and the word "woe".
The Mace of Weal and Woe possessed a +1 enchantments and was significantly more effective with wielded against creatures who followed the law. The weapon had a chance to bestow curse on its targets upon a successful strike. The curse lasted for twelve seconds, negatively affecting the targets morale and aim. Additionally, the Mace of Weal and Woe slightly improved the wielders resistance to various spells ad effects as well as reaction to sudden danger.
The Mace of Weal and Woes history was veiled in mystery with almost nothing known of its origins or even any of its owners. Its first documented appearance, according to many sages, was in 1281 DR, when the mace was stored inside marilith Yxunomeis lair in the Dragons Eye of the Spine of the World.
