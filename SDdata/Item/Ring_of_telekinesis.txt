A '''''ring of telekinesis''''' was a magical ring that allowed the bearer to use the [[spell]] ''[[telekinesis]]'' at will.

==Powers==
As the name suggested, the ring gave the wearer the power of ''telekinesis'', allowing them to move items and creatures weighing up to 225 lb (102 kg). They could be moved with a gentle, sustained force, attacked in a variety of weighs, or hurled up to 90 ft (27 m) with great force. This last application could be applied to up to nine creatures or objects, but only to the limit of the mass.

==Description==
The ''ring of telekinesis'' worn by [[Kilili]] was very large, consisting of a large round red gem in a gold setting. It emitted a pale orange beam that enveloped its target.

==Notable ''Rings of Telekinesis''==
[[File:Ring of telekinesis.jpg|thumb|left|''Kilili using a ''ring of telekinesis'' to rescue and capture Cybriana.'']]
The [[drow]] [[magic-user]] [[Kilili]] possessed a ''ring of telekinesis''. In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], she used it to rescue—and then capture—her sister [[Cybriana]] after she was dropped by a [[gargoyle]] ''en route'' to [[Imgig Zu]]'s tower.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|20}} This ring remained with [[Kyriani]], the result of a merger of Kilili and Cybriana.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy|18}} It returned to Kilili when the two later separated in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]]. The [[wizard]] [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] stole the ring from Kilili and slipped it onto Cybriana's finger, giving the opportunity for the two to re-merge. The new Kyriani used the ring to close the [[Great Door]] with Parwyyd's aid.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|14, 16, 20, 22}} During the [[Time of Troubles]] later that year, Kyriani used her ''ring of telekinesis'' to hurl a table and then pots and pans at a [[Shar|false avatar]].{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|17}}
