Dart of silencing was a type of dart used by the drow.
If this dart missed a living target, it did nothing and could be reused. However, if it successfully struck a target, it enveloped the victim and a continuous area of a  radius around them in temporary magical silence. This silence persisted even if the dart was removed and discarded. The effect could be ended prematurely with dispel magic.
