'''''Last Rest''''' was the [[enchanted]] [[flail]] that belonged to [[Felina Tatch]] who crusaded against the [[undead]].

==Powers==
''Last Rest'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment. The flail head was forged out of [[cold iron]], yet was warm to the touch and emitted a faint glow. Upon contact with the undead, the flail's head health them additional damage and had a chance of eliminating the target undead creature altogether. Additionally, the ''Last Rest'' allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[light]]'' spell at will.

==History==
This enchanted light flail once was wielded by Felina Tatch, a [[priestess]] who made it her life's goal to destroy all vile undead. This act was not motivated by hate but rather by the desire to free the suffering should bound to their shambling unholy husks. Eventually, the cleric's crusade brought her to a conflict with [[vampire]] [[Milikaia]]. She slew and subjugated Felina. However, soon after her death, the undead priestess was seen wandering through the graveyard of her hometown, destroying the undead. Milikaia's fate was unknown.

At some point after Felina's death, ''Last Rest'' was broken into two parts, the haft, and the flail head. In [[1372 DR]], both pieces were discovered by the [[Hero of Daggerford]], one in a pile of "treasures" in [[Torleth Mindulspeer]]'s store in [[Gillian's Hill]], and the other in possessions of [[necromancer]] [[Daxiong]] who laired in the graveyard of Gillian's Hill. The flail was reforged in [[Daggerford]] by [[Derval Ironeater]] for 2,500 [[gold]] pieces.
