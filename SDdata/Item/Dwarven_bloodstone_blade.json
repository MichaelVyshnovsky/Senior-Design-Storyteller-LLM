Additionally, these waraxes dealt additional damage when wielded against giants.\nThese weapons were crafted by the dwarves of Clan Hillsafar in the depths of the Galena Mountains. They were crafted in a variety of designs and possessed different magical powers. The first dwarven bloodstone blades were forged as gifts to a band of dwarven adventurers who helmed a campaign against the \"Thunkers,\" a band of giant bandits. These eccentric adventurers named themselves \"Anti-Thunkers\" after securing Clan Hillsafars mining business from the giant menace.
