Unicorn pendants were magical amulets embossed with the holy symbol of the deity Lurue.
Bearing the head of unicorn, a unicorn pendant could be made of silver or sculpted of marble with a gold horn.
The wearer of the pendant gained the ability to cast cure moderate wounds and neutralize poison once each per day. Paladins who wore this pendant had their "lay on hands" healing ability enhanced.
