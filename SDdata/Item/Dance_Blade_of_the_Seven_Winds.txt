The Dance Blade of the Seven Winds was an enchanted ceremonial dagger that belonged to the aarakocras of Kir Sabal in the late 15 century DR.
The Dance Blade of the Seven Winds belonged to the elders of Kir Sabal, who used it in the ritual of the Dance of the Seven Winds that granted the ability to fly to creatures for a limited time. A black orchid flower was the essential material component of the ritual, and the Dance Blade was used to powder it for the casting. Additionally, when wielded in battle, this blade enhanced the magical abilities of its wielder.
