Sanidine was an ornamental stone found on the surface of sand dunes and gravel screes. Sanidine was favored by the nomadic, desert-dwelling Bedine and facet-cut to ring-stone size or smaller.
Sanidine was a pale tan to straw yellow form of feldspar. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.
Large specimens (about thumb-sized or bigger) could be used to replace all but specially constructed spell components in the casting of spells related to water or purification.
