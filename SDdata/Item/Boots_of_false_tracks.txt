Boots of false tracks were magical boots whose tracks misrepresented the wearers race.
The boots could only be worn by humanoids.
A pair of boots of false tracks could, at the wearers choice, leave tracks that were characteristic of a different humanoid race, as long as the chosen type of creature was roughly the same size as the wearer.
