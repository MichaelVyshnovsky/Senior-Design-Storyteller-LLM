Papyrus pads were items in the Realms often used by wizards for writing.
Papyrus pads were made from high-quality cross-grained papyrus stock pressed in Mulhorand and sewn along one edge by skilled craftsmen from Unther and Chessenta.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 15 gold pieces per 25 sheets.
* Papyrus pads were favored by wizards.
