'''''Everbright''''' was a quality that could be applied to metal [[armor]] The [[sun elves]] of [[Evermeet]] actually improved on the method, adding a blinding-flash ability to an ''everbright''-treated weapon. ''Everbright'' items were incredibly shiny and incorruptibleâ€”immune to rust and corrosion. For an elvish-made blade, the wielder could cause it to flash an extremely bright light twice a day, possibly dazzling those nearby for a few seconds.

==Creation==
To craft an ''everbright'' weapon using the elvish technique, one had to have the spells ''[[blindness or deafness]]'' and ''[[searing light]]'' available. To make a shiny piece of armor only required a sufficiently advanced magical armorsmith.

Once a weapon was enhanced with ''everbright'', its magics could be destroyed via forgefire, earthfire (lava) or dragonfire. This enchantment also made the weapons and armor safe from [[rust monster]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tunnel Vision|14}}

==Notable Examples==
* The guardian god [[Helm]] wore ''+5 everbright [[full plate]]''.
