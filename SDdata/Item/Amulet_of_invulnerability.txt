Amulets of invulnerability were enchanted amulets from the City of Song, Myth Drannor.
Amulets of invulnerability were weighty thick necklaces.
These amulets possessed a +3 enchantment to the wearers defenses and allowed for casting of the globe of invulnerability spell. An average amulet of invulnerability held at least four charges of the spell.
In 1369 DR, one of the amulets of invulnerability could be recovered from the laboratory of insane undead wizard, Thyaast Ammath, in the deepest parts of the Elven Catacombs, by the chasm that led to the Underdark.
