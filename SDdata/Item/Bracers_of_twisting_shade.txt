The '''''bracers of twisting shade''''' were a pair of magical [[bracer]]s found at the [[Old Man's Face Inn]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]], left behind by forces from [[Thultanthar]].{{DDO-time}}

==Powers==
The bracers made the wearer [[blur]]ry and harder to target, while positively affecting their ability to spot that which was hidden and disable traps. They also made it easier to land hits and avoid dangers in general.

==History==
The bracers were recovered from the Old Man's Face after a battle with [[Shadovar]] agents, who were there seeking a piece of the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' under the command of the [[arcanist]] [[Tarys]].
