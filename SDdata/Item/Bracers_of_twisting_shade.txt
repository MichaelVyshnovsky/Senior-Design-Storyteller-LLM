The bracers of twisting shade were a pair of magical bracers found at the Old Mans Face Inn during the mid-1480s DR, left behind by forces from Thultanthar.
The bracers made the wearer blurry and harder to target, while positively affecting their ability to spot that which was hidden and disable traps. They also made it easier to land hits and avoid dangers in general.
The bracers were recovered from the Old Mans Face after a battle with Shadovar agents, who were there seeking a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll under the command of the arcanist Tarys.
