A Devotees Mace was a powerful and exceedingly rare bludgeoning weapon used by celestials and mortals alike.
Devotees maces seemed to be made of some metallic substance similar to gold in color. They also glowed with a yellow-orange light.
In addition to being powerful bludgeoning tools, these +3 maces were able to burn targets with radiant energy on successful hits. Wielders of these weapons were able to quickly summon an aura of healing incense around themselves, which healed them and nearby allies in a 30-foot (9 meters) radius for around a minute. A seemingly magical glow surrounded these weapons.
The process of creating a devotees mace is mostly unknown. Circa the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, some deities were known to answer calls for help from their more powerful clerics by offering them these weapons as an act of divine intervention. The weapon that appeared in a clerics hand as the result of such an intervention was said to be forged in the fires of the holy bond between the worshiper and their deity. While healing and radiant energy were associated mostly with good deities, these weapons could be rewarded by gods of evil alignments. Devotees maces were favored by devas.
