It was secured in place by a skullcap or [[turban]], which in Zakhara was called an ''[[agal]]'' and in Anauroch an ''igal''. A keffiyeh served the practical purpose of protecting the head from the sun and the wind and was often white to avoid absorbing heat.\n\nLength, color, and style varied considerably between tribes, cities, and even families.",
