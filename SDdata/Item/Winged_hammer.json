        "mainbody": "inged hammers were a type of legendary dwarven warhammer.\nWinged hammers were stone, two-headed warhammers with a pair of magical construct wings that self-regenerated.\nWinged hammers were capable of flight through their construct \"wings\". They would deactivate if deliberately left abandoned by their users and reactivate upon being wielded again by either the same or another user.\nWhen thrown, winged hammers would follow and home in on their target, then return to their wielders hand. In the intervening time, if they were grasped by another creature or blocked by a barrier, winged hammers would simply blink back to their original thrower. If their wielder was casting spells at the time, a winged hammer would float nearby until the casting was finished.\nThe one limitation to a winged hammers ability of returning to its owner was being unable to follow them between planes, unless directly carried into them.\nIf a secret word was said to a winged hammer while wielding them, they would fly off to fight whoever they sensed were targets of their users will. This action could be done up to three times a day. If a creature other than their wielder grasped them during this time, winged hammers would blink back to their original wielder. If the original wielder died during this time, a winged hammer would still return to their hand.\nWinged hammers were well known as favored weapons of northern dwarves in the Lost Kingdoms."
