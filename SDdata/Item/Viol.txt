A '''viol''' was a six-string instrument similar to a [[violin]].

==Description==
Viols had a deeply resonant sound that conveyed melancholy themes very well. They could be played on their own or as part of larger ensembles. Viols were particularly favored by [[dwarves]], owing to their deep and dark sounds.

Viols were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', produced by the same craftsmen from [[Waterdeep]] and [[Selgaunt]] who produced the violins sold through the catalogue.
