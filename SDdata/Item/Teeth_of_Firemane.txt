'''''Teeth of Firemane''''' were [[enchanted]] [[dart]]s of the [[Nobanionite]] faith.

==Powers==
These thrown weapons were imbued with powerful ''+5'' enchantments. The magics within ''Teeth of Firemane'' dealt additional damage when used against animals and beasts of both magical and mundane nature.

==History==
''Teeth of Firemane'' were considered sacred weapons of the Church of Nobanion. They first were created before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], around the time [[The Roar of Shadows]] shook the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. ''Teeth of Firemane'' were created out of the teeth of a lion and contained the leonine powers of [[Nobanion]], the Lion King. After that, these darts were actively used by the followers of the deity against the [[Black-Blooded Pard]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a set of the ''Teeth of Firemane'' could be found in the [[Rashemi]] city of [[Mulsantir]], sold by [[Azim Qo'toth]], Merchant of [[Mulhorand]].
