A '''''wand of winter''''' was a magical [[wand]] that granted the wielder access powerful magical spells related to ice, snow, and other effects of intense cold.

==Description==
It resembled a large icicle and felt just as cold in the wielder's hand.

==Powers==
The wand possessed seven charges, one or more of which were expended every time it was used. Whomever wielded a ''wand of winter'' could use it to produce the spells ''[[ray of frost]]'' (without expending a charge), ''[[sleet storm]]'', or ''[[ice storm]]''.

A number of the wand's charges were restored each day. If it was ever completely exhausted of its power, there was a chance the wand would instantly melt and never be usable again.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Talis]] the White, one of the [[wyrmspeaker]]s of the 15{{th}} century [[Cult of the Dragon]].
