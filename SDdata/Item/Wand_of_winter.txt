A wand of winter was a magical wand that granted the wielder access powerful magical spells related to ice, snow, and other effects of intense cold.
It resembled a large icicle and felt just as cold in the wielders hand.
The wand possessed seven charges, one or more of which were expended every time it was used. Whomever wielded a wand of winter could use it to produce the spells ray of frost (without expending a charge), sleet storm, or ice storm.
A number of the wands charges were restored each day. If it was ever completely exhausted of its power, there was a chance the wand would instantly melt and never be usable again.
