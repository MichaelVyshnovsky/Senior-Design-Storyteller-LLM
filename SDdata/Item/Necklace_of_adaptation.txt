A necklace of adaptation was a magical necklace that protected the wearer from things that affected their ability to breathe.
It took the form of a platinum medallion hanging on a heavy chain.
This necklace allowed the user to breathe under suffocating circumstances, even when underwater but not in a vacuum such as space. By wrapping the wearer with a field of fresh air.
Crafting one required an alter self spell.
