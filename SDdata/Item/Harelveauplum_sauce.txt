Harelveauplum sauce was a hin condiment cooked using plums from Luiren in the Shining South.
This thick and syrupy sauce of deep dark maroon color was a cooked concoction of fresh plums, local hot peppers, sweet peppers, and thello-fruit (a kiwi-tasting fruit with thick glue-like juice). The final product was a spicy and sweet sauce with hints of acidity.
