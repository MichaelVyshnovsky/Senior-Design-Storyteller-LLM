        "mainbody": "Sure striking short swords were short swords enhanced with the sure striking enchantment.\nSure striking short swords varied in design and all appeared to be quite simple double-edged pointed blades, not much bigger than a dagger â€“  long.\nThe enchantments placed on the swords made them dramatically easier to wield and land a strike on a target. Even though their damage potential was in line with a simple +1 enchantment, their magically enchanted aim was comparable to a powerful +5 enchantment.\nIn the , one such sword was carried by Artemus of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale. His home was ransacked and broken into building materials by the orc invaders of the Broken Tusk Clan that took his village hostage. However, Artes stock remained unmolested as orcs failed to find the storage cellar of his shop where the sure striking short sword could be found, along with several less valuable items and enchanted +1 throwing hammer and a magical +1 flail."
