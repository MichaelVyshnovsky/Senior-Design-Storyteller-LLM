The '''Stalwart Scales''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of [[splint mail]] [[armor]], crafted by the [[dwarven]] armorsmith [[Hedda Perigot]].

==Description==
The armor comprised shimmering bands of [[steel]] that had been affixed to a leather breastplate. It was noticeably lightweight compared to other suits of armor, and extremely flexible for the wearer.

==Powers==
The ''+2 splint mail'' offered significant protection against [[blade]]s and other [[:category:slashing weapons|slashing weapons]].

==History==
At some point after the armor's creation, it came into the possession of the dwarven smith [[Jegg Hillcarver]], of [[Bridgefort]].
