        "mainbody": "The '''''Orb of Insight''''' was a strange enchanted item from another world that belonged to a [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard]] and an apprentice of [[Halaster Blackcloak]], [[Ibbalar Thrul]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].",
        "Powers": "Upon ''[[detect magic]]'' being cast, the ''Orb of Insight'' radiated glow indicating its magical nature. The ''orb's'' main power was revealed when the user asked it a question and flipped the item. The ''orb'' manifested an answer to the question asked on the opposite side of the \"8\" symbol.",
        "History": "Ibbalar Thrul acquired the mysterious ''orb'' sometime before 1370 DR. He stored the item inside his [[Undermountain]] lair's trophy gallery, alongside a ''spider piece'' of [[Lolth]], a living [[drow]] priestess encased in glass, and many other exotic and magical items. The ''Orb of Insight'' was still in Ibbalar Thrul's possession when many of the lair's guardians fell to the sword of an agent of [[Khelben Arunsun]] who was seeking  to stop the [[spectator]] invasion of [[Waterdeep]] caused by the Red Wizard.."
