The '''''Flail of Mae''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[morning star]] wielded by [[Eled the Desecrator]] sometime before [[1281 DR]].

==Description==
The ''Flail of Mae'' appeared to be an ordinary morning star, however, unlike other similar weapons, it was made out of solid [[granite]].

==Powers==
This weapon possessed a powerful ''+3'' enchantment and had a small chance of ''[[Petrification|petrifying]]'' its targets upon a successful strike.

==History==
The ''Flail of Mae'' was created by a group of evil [[medusae]] and [[maedar]] as the payment to Eled the Desecrator, a warrior who was a crusader and defender of all malicious creatures. Eled used the morning star with terrifying efficiency until the end of his life sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. Eventually, the weapon found its way into the hands of [[Quinn Silverfinger]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] in the [[Golden Lodge]] of [[Lonelywood]].
