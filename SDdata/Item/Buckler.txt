A '''buckler''', also known as a '''target shield''', was a small [[shield]] useful as a defense in melee combat.  Due to its small size, a buckler was of limited use in defending against missiles.

==Description==
Bucklers could be made from various objects. Fighting [[cleric]]s could strap a field brazier to their arm to serve as a buckler. The [[eladrin]] [[wizard]] [[Caelynna]] used a clamshell as a buckler. [[Ironwood]] saw usage throughout much of the [[Sword Coast]], as the material made for very durable and lighter weight bucklers. And in [[Zakhara]], many [[daraq]]s (Zakharan bucklers) were made from [[tortoise]] shells.{{cite book/Arabian Adventures|156}}
