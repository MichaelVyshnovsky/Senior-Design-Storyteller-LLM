Tabards were widely used throughout Faerûn.
Tabards were a simple, yet effective garment to identify armies and personal guards. They were typically adorned with the familys or citys colors and insignia.
Auroras Emporium offered tabards in large quantities, made of linen imported from Daerlun and dyed with pigments imported from Baldurs Gate. Prices per individual piece varied depending on the amount ordered, ranging from 6 sp for orders of fewer than twenty units to 3 sp for orders larger than 200.
Tabards produced by Auroras Emporium were said to be well known and appreciated in Elturel, Selgaunt, and Waterdeep.
