'''Tabards''' were widely used throughout [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Tabards were a simple, yet effective garment to identify armies and personal guards. They were typically adorned with the family's or city's colors and insignia.

==History==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] offered tabards in large quantities, made of [[linen]] imported from [[Daerlun]] and dyed with pigments imported from [[Baldur's Gate]]. Prices per individual piece varied depending on the amount ordered, ranging from 6 sp for orders of fewer than twenty units to 3 [[sp]] for orders larger than 200.

==Reputation==
Tabards produced by Aurora's Emporium were said to be well known and appreciated in [[Elturel]], [[Selgaunt]], and [[Waterdeep]].
