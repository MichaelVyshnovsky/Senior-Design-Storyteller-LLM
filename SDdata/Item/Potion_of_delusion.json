        "mainbody": "'''''Potions of delusion''''' were [[potion]]s that caused those who drank them to believe they had imbibed and gained the effects of any number of other magical potions.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], one of the apprentice [[magic-user]]s in [[Zhentil Keep]] failed in creating a potion and it resulted in a ''potion of delusion''.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], whenever the [[Wizards Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] was coerced into surrendering magical potions or gravely suspected that an [[adventurer]] requesting them would put them to misuse, they would instead gift ''potions of delusion'' or faulty [[potion of levitation|''potions of levitation'']].",
        "Creation": "Suggested special ingredients for such potions were the flesh of a [[doppelganger]], the \"ichor\" or spiritual essence of a [[rakshasa]], and in the case of [[Zakhara]] the blood of an [[al-jahar]].\n\nIt was also said that there was a small chance that any failed attempt in brewing a potion would result in a ''potion of delusion''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Multiple ''potions of delusion'' were owned by the [[balor]] [[Ter-soth]].\n* Multiple ''potions of delusion'' could be found in the treasure horde of [[Tiamat's Lair]]."
