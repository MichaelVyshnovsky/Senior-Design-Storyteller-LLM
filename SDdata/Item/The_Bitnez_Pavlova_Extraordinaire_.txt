'''The Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire!''' was a baked light and fluffy treat made with [[garlic]], created by eccentric [[wizard]] [[Rab Bitnez]] and featured in his cookbook ''[[101 Garlic Recipes]]''.

{{quote|''Trust me, it's just the most exquisite sensation on the tongue. It's like little garlicky crackling stars.''|Rab Bitnez}}

==Description==
This dish required five [[egg]] whites, sugar, a sprinkle of [[vinegar]], [[vanilla]] essence, [[corn]] starch, ten garlic cloves, and a pinch of [[salt]]. The egg whites were beaten with salt and vinegar, slowly adding in [[sugar]], finely diced garlic, and [[vanilla]]. The mixture was mixed until evenly incorporated, then the starch was added to thicken and stabilize the mixture. The mixture then was shaped into medallions with an indentation in the middle and baked on a buttered sheet. The rest of the minced garlic was whipped with the cream until it could be piped into the baked meringue shells. This dish was best served immediately after the assembly was completed.
