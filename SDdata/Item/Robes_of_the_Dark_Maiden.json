        "Powers": "''Robes of the Dark Maiden'' bore a potent defensive ''+5'' enchantment, granter the wearer immunity to mundane and magical ''[[fear]]'', as well as granted or enchanted their ''[[darkvision]]''. Due to the robes' enchantments tailored specifically for the drow, they could only be worn by creatures of [[elven]] blood.",
        "History": "These robes were ensorcelled to be worn by the [[monk]] devotees of the [[drow]] goddess [[Eilistraee]]. The monastic Order of the Dark Maiden worked to promote their deity's values - peace and harmony between the drow and the inhabitants of the surface world. Even though peaceful by nature, they were swift to smite evil aggressors and the robes' enchantments kept the monks safe.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of these magic robes left the hands fo their drow owners and entered a wider circulation in the regions of the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]]."
