A '''bell''' was a hollow metal instrument that made a ringing noise when struck.

==Description==
As well as being used as ringing devices, bells were [[material component]]s for a number of [[spell]]s. Bells were used in spells such as ''[[alarm]]'', ''[[vocalize]]'', ''[[Leomund's secure shelter]]'' (should it be augmented with other spells), ''[[watchware]]'', ''[[Detho's delirium]]'', and ''[[elemental guide]]''.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold many types of bells, such as [[gold]]en ones for 5 [[gp]] each. Dinner bells were also sold here, and were cast from either [[brass]] or [[silver]]. Standard silver bells were 1 [[gp]] each, and brass bells were 1 [[ep]] each.

==Varieties==
;[[Dinner bell]]: A type of tiny bell that was used to announce that dinner was being serving.<ref>
;[[Tocken]]: A type of wood carved bell.

==Notable Bells==
There were several [[magic]]al bells throughout the lands of [[Toril]]. Some were:
* The ''[[Bell of Attricus]]'' was a powerful magic bell that could form an enchanted shield around a settlement.{{cite book/Tantras|249-252}}
* The [[Bell in the Depths]], part of the remains of [[Northkeep]], a sunken city. The bell could never be stopped from its mysterious ringing.
* ''[[Bell of warning]]'', a type of small magical bell from the land of [[Kara-Tur]] that could detect the presence of anyone approaching it covertly.{{ Cite book/Oriental Adventures|134}}
* ''[[Mithral bells]]'', a chain of bells made of [[mithral]], which, when thrown like a grenade, would explode in a ''[[sound burst]]''.
