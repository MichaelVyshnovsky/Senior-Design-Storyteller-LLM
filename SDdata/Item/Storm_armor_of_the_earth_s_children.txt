'''''Storm armor of the earth's children''''' was a variety of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[full plate]] armor.

==Powers==
Those who wore one of these armors were bestowed a resistance towards [[fire]]-based abilities and [[magic]], as well as against the elemental energies of cold and electricity and fire.

Although enchanted suits of armor would broadly resize to fit their wearers, this armor would only resize to fit the bodies of [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s.
