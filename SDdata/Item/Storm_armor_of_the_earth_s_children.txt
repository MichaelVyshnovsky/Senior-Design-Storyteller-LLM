Storm armor of the earths children was a variety of enchanted full plate armor.
Those who wore one of these armors were bestowed a resistance towards fire-based abilities and magic, as well as against the elemental energies of cold and electricity and fire.
Although enchanted suits of armor would broadly resize to fit their wearers, this armor would only resize to fit the bodies of dwarves, gnomes, and halflings.
