        "Powers": "To make use of the work, a wizard of the correct alignment (neither good-aligned nor evil-aligned before {{yearlink|1372}}, the later book instead increased the natural qualities of the magician that governed their spellcasting. In either case, the book disappeared after use, and no mage could gain the benefit of such a tome again.\n\nFor the earlier version, arcane casters whose alignment was rejected by the book suffered severe damage, leaving them unconscious for 50â€“200 minutes, commensurate to the damage taken, and needed an ''[[atonement]]'' spell cast in order to continue their studies. Anyone not an arcane spellcaster in the first place who read the tome was at risk of ''[[insanity]]''.",
