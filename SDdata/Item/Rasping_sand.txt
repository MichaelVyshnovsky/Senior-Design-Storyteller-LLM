'''''Rasping sand'''''  was a deadly [[magical sand]] found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, that tore away at any surface..{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}}

==Powers==
When thrown, this sand tore both living and non-living surfaces for three full minutes before expiring. Against non-living material one handful of ''rasping sand'' would literally destroy up to 100 pounds (45 kg) of the object in question.

Living creatures suffered increasingly devastating damage while the sand eroded their flesh.

Despite its terrifying reputation, ''rasping sand'' could be easily counteracted with a gallon of water per handful of sand. The water would instantly negate the sand, causing it to dissolve. 

Anyone wishing to throw a handful of ''rasping sand'' needed to wear a protective glove or risk becoming the object of its deadly affection.
