Wearers of ''Helms of the Horselords'' were immune to ordinary and magical ''[[fear]]'', gained slightly improved concentration, and gained a gift of almost uncanny intimidation.",
        "History": "''Helms of the Horselords'' started appearing in Faerûn after the failed Tuigan invasion helmed by the self-proclaimed Emperor of All the World [[Yamun Khahan]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. Most Tuigan warriors wore simple fur caps or helmets looted off the enemy bodies, yet some were given magical ''Helms of the Horselords''. Commanders of the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] were the lucky owners of the enchanted helmets that instilled terror in the hearts of enemies and follow troops alike.\n\nOne such helmets was available for purchase in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} from [[Okuzo's Imports]] store in [[Westgate]]."
