'''Davek''' was a runic script used by the [[Dwarven]] and [[Giant language]]s of worlds such as [[Nerath]] and [[Eberron]]. It was used to a much lesser extent for Dwarven on [[Toril]], where [[Dethek]] was widespread.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-08 - Davek Script}}<ref group="note">The ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' and ''[[Dwarves Deep]]'' both state that Dethek is just the "most common" of a number of dwarven-made scripts, suggesting Davek (which was invented in 4{{th}} edition) may be one of these lesser writings. 

==Writing==
Only those who were versed in Dethek could distinguish Davek from it. Most [[human]] commoners, having only a passing familiarity with Dethek, would just recognize Davek script as looking vaguely Dwarvish.

==History==
This dwarven script originated on another world, likely Nerath, where it was developed to transcribe Dwarven. The Giant language came to use it following the dwarves' long servitude to the [[giant]]s there.

Over time, planar travelers from these other worlds brought to Toril [[book]]s written in Davek, items labeled with it, and some knowledge of it until it began to be known on Toril.

One group introduced to this alphabet were the [[dwarves]] of [[Ammarindar (kingdom)|Ammarindar]], who at least partially inscribed their special stepping disks with the script.
