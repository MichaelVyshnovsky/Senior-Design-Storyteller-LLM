        "mainbody": "ourmaline was a long-crystalled mineral that came in many colors and was considered a fancy stone.\nTourmaline could be found in a wide variety of colors, the more common being pale shades of blue, brown, gold, green, pink, red, and silver pearl. And a red or pink tourmaline was called a rubellite.\nTourmalines were considered sacred by followers of Deneir&mdashappropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The rainbow variety of tourmaline was sacred to followers of Mystra.\nThese stones were mined in the Ten Towns region in northwest Faer√ªn near the town of Termalaine.\nAll tourmalines could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three lightning bolts that blasted outward in straight lines from the crystal facets in directions chosen by the caster. This act consumed the gem in the process.\nTourmaline was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they used only those of blue and red color."
