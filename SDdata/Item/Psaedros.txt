Psaedros, also known as lepidolite, was a decorative hardstone mostly used for carving.
Psaedros was a soft mica rock that occurred in colors ranging from pink to mauve to lilac. Over time, its color faded, especially when exposed to sunlight. It was used in low-end carving, like bowls, coffers, and small statues. A typical price was 6 sp per pound or about 2 sp 7 cp per kilogram.
A piece of psaedros about the size of hand could be used in place of the fire and holy water components when casting the wind walk spell.
