        "mainbody": "The armor of the glacier was a magical set of armor.\nThis set of armor had a +1 enchantment. Whoever wore the armor gained resistance to fire. In addition, attacks from fire-based monsters (such as efreeti and fire giants) did half as much damage as normal to the wearer of armor of the glacier.\nIn 1358 DR, a knight of Tuern called Kestutis was tied up by a group of pirates. He was rescued by the Heroes of Ascore, and in return, he gifted the heroes the armor he wore during his service, the armor of the glacier.\n* Kestutis\n* The Heroes of Ascore"
