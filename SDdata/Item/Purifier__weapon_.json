        "mainbody": "'''''Purifier''''' was a [[holy avenger]] [[bastard sword]] that could only be recovered and wielded by the [[lawful good|more pure and just]] paladins from amongst the Realms.",
        "Powers": "''Purifier'' possessed a powerful ''+4 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and granted its wielder some protection from [[spell]]s and other [[magic|magical effects]]. It was particularly harmful against the most [[chaotic evil|lawless and despicable beings]] that someone could encounter.\n\nTwice per day, its wielder could ''[[dispel magic|dispel away any magical effects]]'' that surrounded its wielder.\n\nThe imp [[Cespenar]] was somewhat familiar with this weapon, and knew it could be improved by setting the jewel known as the ''[[Eye of Tyr]]'' within its pommel.",
        "History": "It was believed the sword once belonged to the famous paladin [[Wediyer|Sir Wediyer]] and lost when he chased down a [[pit fiend]] through an extra-planar ''[[portal]]''.\n\nWhile it was believed the ''Purifier'' was lost forever, it was in fact embedded into a rock formation found within the labyrinthine third level of [[Watcher's Keep]].",
        "Reputation": "According to legend, ''Purifier'' was \"infused with the very essence of virtue\"."
