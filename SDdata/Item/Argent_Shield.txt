The '''''Argent Shield''''' was one of the [[enchanted]] shield created in the [[Seldarine's Hand]] citadel on the [[Spine of the World]].

==Description==
This [[silver]] shield bore markings of the Seldarine's Hand and was designed to protect its wielder physically and magically.

==Powers==
The ''Argent Shield'' possessed a potent defensive ''+3'' enchantment and granted the wielder limited resistance to [[magic]]. Its magics were attuned exclusively to [[elves]], rendering the shield unusable by anyone else.

==History==
After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|900}}, the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the [[dwarves]] of Dorn's Deep. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best armor and weapons created by the crafters of both races. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadel's fall, the ''Argent Shield'' remained within the ruins, discard by invading [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s as trash due to its magical attainment. Maiden [[Ilmadia Bariel]], who served [[Ilmatari]] [[priest]] Revered Brother [[Poquelin]], reclaimed the enchanted shield from the Hand's ruins and bore it until her death in 1281 DR at the hands of the [[Heroes of Icewind Dale]].
