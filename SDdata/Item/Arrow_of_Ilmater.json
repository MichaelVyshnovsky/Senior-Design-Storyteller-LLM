        "mainbody": "'''''Arrows of Ilmater''''' were a variety of deceptively named [[arrow]]s, [[Item enchantment|enhcanted]] by a particularly devious [[cleric]] of [[Loviatar]].",
        "Description": "These missiles featured a three-pronged arrowhead made out of some manner of bone. [[Loviatar]]an by craft, ''Arrows of Ilmater'' were ironically named for the reputation [[Ilmatari]] clerics had as altruistic healers who bestowed their services for folks across the Realms.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Arrow of Ilmater close up.png|thumb|''Arrow of Ilmater arrowhead.'']]\nThese arrows were imbued with [[necrotic energy]]. When they struck true, the ''arrows of Ilmater'' prevented a target from magical or mundane healing for several seconds.",
        "History": "These magic arrows could be found in select locales across the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Dammon]], the [[tiefling]] smith from [[Elturel]] came across one of these arrows during his travels and offered it for sale to others."
