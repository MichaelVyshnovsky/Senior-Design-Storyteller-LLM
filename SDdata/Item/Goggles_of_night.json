        "Powers": "''Goggles of night'' granted the wearer [[darkvision]] out to a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. The darkvision of creatures that already had this ability was enhanced by increasing the range of the darkvision by {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nAn armored version of the ''goggles of night'' existed in [[Northwest Faer√ªn]]. The ''goggles of night'' were integrated into an [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] as two dark and opaque [[crystal]] lenses inlaid in the helmets' eyeholes. The crystals allowed the helmet's wearer to see normally and granted them darkvision.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''goggles of night'' were called \"the great equalizer\" by the [[human]]s who ventured into the [[Underdark]]. These goggles and helmets were common equipment among Underdark explorers and human [[rogue]]s.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Dela Nereth]] of the [[Bloodsailors]] gang in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]], sold ''goggles of night'' to the gang's allies out of the [[Seedy Tavern]]."
