The girdle of Gond was an enchanted belt created by clerics of Gond to be used exclusively by rogues.
the girdle of Gond possessed numerous pouches that were filled with everything a thief, rogue, or trapper would even need, seemingly producing required tools to aid them in their trade. The belt assisted its wearer in finding traps and opening even the most complex locks.
This enchanted girdle was commissioned from priests of Gond by Jurmar the Calm, a Gond-worshiping burglar. He started his career as a simple locksmith but graduated to using his skills in burglary.
By 1281 DR, the girdle of Gond came to be owned by Orrick the Gray, a wizard who lived on the edge of Kuldahar and dedicated his life to the study of mythals.
