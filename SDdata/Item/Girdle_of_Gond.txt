The '''''girdle of Gond''''' was an enchanted [[belt]] created by [[cleric]]s of [[Gond]] to be used exclusively by [[rogue]]s.

==Powers==
the ''girdle of Gond'' possessed numerous pouches that were filled with everything a [[thief]], [[rogue]], or [[trapper]] would even need, seemingly producing required tools to aid them in their trade. The belt assisted its wearer in finding traps and opening even the most complex locks.

==History==
This enchanted girdle was commissioned from priests of Gond by [[Jurmar]] the Calm, a Gond-worshiping burglar. He started his career as a simple [[locksmith]] but graduated to using his skills in burglary.

By 1281 DR, the ''girdle of Gond'' came to be owned by [[Orrick]] the Gray, a [[wizard]] who lived on the edge of Kuldahar and dedicated his life to the study of ''[[mythal]]s''.
