'''''Geb's quarterstaff''''' was a unique melee weapon wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Geb]], the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
The weapon was a [[quarterstaff]].

==Powers==
This weapon carried a stout ''+3'' [[enchantment]] that made it easier for Geb to strike and harm opponents during combat. The real power of the quarterstaff lay in its ability to duplicate the effects of any [[spell]] or [[magic item]] related to the earth. For example, Geb could use the quarterstaff to cast [[earthquake]] and then use it like a ''[[spade of colossal excavation]]'' and so on.
