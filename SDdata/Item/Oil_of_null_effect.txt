The '''''oil of null effect''''' was a type of [[oil]] developed on accident by a group of [[derro]] savants.

==Description==
This oil was typically kept in slender vials and had a very opaque, white look to it.

==Powers==
Applying the ''oil of null effect'' to any creature's body would ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' all [[magic]]al effects attached to it. This effect was known to even work on ''[[curse]]s'', ''[[contingency]] [[spell]]s'', and ''[[geas/quest]]'' spells.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, a vial of this oil was found in the Lower Depths of [[Dorn's Deep]] by a group of adventurers. They would proceed to use this ''oil of null effect'' to free the [[drow]] [[Ginafae Despana]] from the contingency spells that her mad brother [[Malavon Despana|Malavon]] had placed upon her.
