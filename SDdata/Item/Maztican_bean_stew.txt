'''Maztican bean stew''' was a staple of the [[Maztican]] cuisine.

==Description==
These simple stews were cooked in [[ceramic|clay]] pots over red fire coals. Its main ingredients were [[bean]]s, [[tomato]]s, and [[pepper]]s. The stew was served with [[mayzcake]]s â€“ another staple of the Maztican cuisine.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, [[Erixitl]], The Chosen Daughter of [[Qotal]], was kindly invited to share a hearty meal of mayzcakes and stew with mother [[Tzilla]]. The lone woman packed a satchel of mayzcakes and stew for Erixitl's travel the following day as she departed [[Ulatos]] in attempt to stop the looming war between Ulatos and [[Amn]].
