        "mainbody": "A '''''bard's blade''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[blade]] that granted the wielder a number of powerful boons and [[magic]]al abilities. They were known to exist in [[Faerûn]] prior to the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Description": "This type of blade could appear in the form of a [[dagger]], [[short sword]], or [[long sword]] and always possessed a ''+2 enchantment''. Regardless of its shape and size, it offered its wielder limited protected against petrification, unwanted shape-changing, immobilization, and sleep and [[charm]] effects.\n\nThe blade could ''[[neutralize poison]]'' by contact and will of the wielder, three times per day.\n\nAdditionally, a ''bard's blade'' had four spells cast into it upon creation: ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[time stop]]''. Whenever the wielder grasped the blade and so willed, they could release the effects of one of these spells. These spells could only be \"recharged\" by a subsequent re-casting of the spell, directed upon the blade itself."
