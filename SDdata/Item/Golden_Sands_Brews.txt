'''Golden Sands Brews''' encompassed several different [[lager]]s from [[Calimshan]]. They were available from vendors in [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Daggerford]], and [[Cormyr]] and were also sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].

==Description==
The different types of Golden Sands brews were:
* Golden Sands Basic – The purest form of the Golden Sands lagers, this brew did not contain any additional flavorings. It had a light yellow coloration.
* Golden Sands Gold – This lager contained flavor from select cacti and [[nettle]]s, adding a distinctly sharp taste to the drink. It had a deep golden color.
* Golden Sands Orange – [[Orange]] and [[currant]] were used to flavor this lager, giving it a slightly acidic aftertaste. This lager was the sweetest of the Golden Sands brews.

==Prices==
All of the Golden Sands Brews could be purchased in the following containers:
* Hand keg (2 [[sp]])
* Cask (1 [[gp]])
* Barrel (25 sp)
* [[Butt]] (8 gp)
* [[Tun]] (16 gp)

==History==
[[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] ordered a Golden Sands Orange at the [[Bold Bard]] in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], in [[Eleint]] of [[1367 DR]], as it was the sweetest and least bitter brew he knew of. He had it again the next night.

Golden Sands Brews were available from the [[Den of the Seven Vales]] inn and the [[Mithrest]] in the [[Athkatla/Guards District|Guards District]] of [[Athkatla]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
