        "mainbody": "zulkoon was a wind musical instrument that functioned like a portable pump organ.\nA zulkoon player pumped air into the instrument and through its organ pipes using a foot pump. This produced a droning sound over other notes due to the constant flow of air through the instrument and conferred it a sinister and dramatic sound.\nZulkoons were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nZulkoons were created by the zulkirs of Thay and were used originally to aid in the casting of spells."
