Lightnings Folly Wine was a variety of rare wine produced in a tiny winery in Tantras in the late 14 century DR.
In the , Jesperata, an ex-cleric of Talos turned vintner, attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast. Jesperatas small wine-making business began very recently circa 1371 DR, and she only brought two bottles to the wine-tasting and rating competition that took place at the festival. Lightnings Folly Wine was a wonderfully tasting drink, possibly the best among the contestants, despite its scant quantity. Jesperata sold a single serving of her wine for a silver piece but limited it to one per person.
