The '''''Touch of Cyric''''' was a unique magic [[ring]] that bore the name and gravely power of [[Cyric]], the Prince of Lies. It was part of the ''Fading Rings'' set.

==Description==
The ''Touch of Cyric'' was a band carved out of [[ivory]] and appeared to be almost ghostly and incorporeal, as if fading out of existence.

==Powers==
This magic ring possessed two enchantments. First was the protection from [[fear]] the ring bestowed upon its owner. The second was the  powerful and fearsome ability to cast the ''[[finger of death]]'' spell. This ring was only usable by [[sorcerer]]s.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], ''Touch of Cyric'' came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, ''the Great Stone Head'', located in the [[Nightingale Court]] in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. In exchange for one of the ''[[eidolon]]s'', small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the etherial-looking ivory ring, the ''Touch of Cyric'', that allowed the wearer to instantly kill a target creature.
