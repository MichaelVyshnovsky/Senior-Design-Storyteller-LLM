The Touch of Cyric was a unique magic ring that bore the name and gravely power of Cyric, the Prince of Lies. It was part of the Fading Rings set.
The Touch of Cyric was a band carved out of ivory and appeared to be almost ghostly and incorporeal, as if fading out of existence.
This magic ring possessed two enchantments. First was the protection from fear the ring bestowed upon its owner. The second was the  powerful and fearsome ability to cast the finger of death spell. This ring was only usable by sorcerers.
In 1369 DR, Touch of Cyric came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head, located in the Nightingale Court in the ruins of Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the etherial-looking ivory ring, the Touch of Cyric, that allowed the wearer to instantly kill a target creature.
