The kau sin ke was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur. It was also known as a whipping chain.
It consisted of approximately four to six short iron bars interconnected by multiple links of chain,  in length. The weapons origins were traced back to the agricultural flail. When wielded skillfully, it possessed the potential to be a formidable weapon, as the iron bars can encircle shields, delivering powerful and crushing strikes.
