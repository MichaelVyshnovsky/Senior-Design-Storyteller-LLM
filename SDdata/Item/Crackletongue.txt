'''''Crackletongue''''' was the [[magic]]al [[sword]] of [[Zaranda Star]], which she nearly always kept by her side.

==Description==
It was a [[saber]] with a basket hilt. When the sword was drawn, blue flames ran along the blade.

==Powers==
''Crackletongue'' was a ''+5 saber of [[sharpness]]'' that could detect [[evil]]-aligned beings. When malevolent forces were nearby, the blue flames on the blade crackled. When the saber struck something evil, it emitted a snarl and showers of blue flame. It could slice through armor, muscle, and bone with ease.
