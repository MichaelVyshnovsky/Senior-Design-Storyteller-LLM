Crackletongue was the magical sword of Zaranda Star, which she nearly always kept by her side.
It was a saber with a basket hilt. When the sword was drawn, blue flames ran along the blade.
Crackletongue was a +5 saber of sharpness that could detect evil-aligned beings. When malevolent forces were nearby, the blue flames on the blade crackled. When the saber struck something evil, it emitted a snarl and showers of blue flame. It could slice through armor, muscle, and bone with ease.
