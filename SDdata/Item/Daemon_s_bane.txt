A daemons bane was a diabolic amulet found in the Utter East during the Bloodforge Wars (648â€“657 DR).
It was the effigy of a horned skull on a six-pointed star hanging on a chain. It granted a protection against attacks from virtuous creatures (such as those produced at a temple of Lathander on a mystical site).
