Revelations of the Icedawn was a holy book of Auril containing some of the most prized prayers of the Frostmaidens faith.
The book had pages that looked and felt as if they were made of blue ice.
A gift from Auril to Iyraclea with which she was supposed to herald a particularly cold winter, the book was taken by an unidentified man who then fled to Icewind Dale. He was chased by a pair of gelugons who mortally wounded him in a Ten Towns marketplace and retrieved the book. The mans final words were carried south as far as Waterdeep. Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun sent several Moonstars to investigate and possibly recover the book. Their bodies were eventually located, frozen quite literally to the core, and the book was lost.
The book contained prayers that granted appropriately devout supplicants the spells
* Aurils flowers
* Cold fire
* Cold snap
* Corona of cold
* Freeze
* Frost breath
* Frostbite
* Heat leech
* Ice axe
* Ice gauntlet
