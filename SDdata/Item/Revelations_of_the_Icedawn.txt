'''''Revelations of the Icedawn''''' was a [[holy book]] of [[Auril]] containing some of the most prized prayers of the Frostmaiden's faith.{{Cite dragon/312/Faiths of Faerun: Prayers of the Frostmaiden|62}}

==Description==
The book had pages that looked and felt as if they were made of blue ice.

==History==
A gift from Auril to [[Iyraclea]] with which she was supposed to herald a particularly cold winter, the book was taken by an unidentified man who then fled to [[Icewind Dale]]. He was chased by a pair of [[gelugon]]s who mortally wounded him in a [[Ten Towns]] marketplace and retrieved the book. The man's final words were carried south as far as [[Waterdeep]]. [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] sent several [[Moonstars]] to investigate and possibly recover the book. Their bodies were eventually located, frozen quite literally to the core, and the book was lost.

==Contents==
