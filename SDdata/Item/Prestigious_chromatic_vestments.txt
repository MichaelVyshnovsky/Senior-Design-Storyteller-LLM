Prestigious chromatic vestments were enchanted robes that belonged to the aarakocra people of Kir Sabal in the late 15 century DR.
Chromatic vestments were made out of uncannily light material of shivering colors that moved as if underwater.
The enchantments placed on this set of robes made the wearer hard to strike, with the physical impact of hits dispersed as if fighting a water elemental.
