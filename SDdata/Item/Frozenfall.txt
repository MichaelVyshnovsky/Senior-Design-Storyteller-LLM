A frozenfall was a magical sculpture of a waterfall made by suspending gems in midair. In addition to their diaphanous beauty, many were enchanted to do different things when certain conditions were met. Some were even the foci of a minor mythal that protected the structure in which they were housed.
Frozenfalls were made with thousands of gems that were cabochon-cut or tumbled until smooth, and polished to a sparkling shine. Each stone was enchanted to have a gentle, inner glow and then the collection was suspended in place by a relatively simple spell that bound them all together in an invisible web that was shaped by the sculptor. Other enchantments could be added and then the aggregation of spells and gems was made permanent.
Some typical dweomers added to a frozenfall were the ability to chime softly or play music when touched by sunlight, moonlight, or a living being. Individual stones could be made to act like a ring of spell storing and produce their effects when touched and called upon by a member of the house. Likewise, anyone who attempted to steal a gem or damage the sculpture might be met with devastating offensive or defensive magic.
Frozenfalls could be used as the basis of a house-sized mythal that could protect the structure and warn its inhabitants of imminent danger. Some even went so far as to incorporate one or more spirits of family ancestors who, like baelnorns, stayed behind to guard, protect, or advise their descendants. Such powerful house mythals gave visitors the feeling of being watched or overheard and could speak if addressed in the correct language.
Frozenfalls were invented by the elves and were popular in Myth Drannor before it fell to the Army of Darkness in the . The House of Taeros, built in the days of the Realm of Three Crowns, was known to have two frozenfalls in the magnificent main hall before it was destroyed in a spellbattle sometime near the end of the 6 century DR, leaving only the ruin known as the Crumbling Stair behind.
