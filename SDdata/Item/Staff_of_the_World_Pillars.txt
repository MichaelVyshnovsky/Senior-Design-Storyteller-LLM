The Staff of the World Pillars was a powerful magical staff carried by the Forgotten God.
This staff combined all of the effects of a ring of regeneration, a staff of withering, and chimes of interruption. In the hands of the Forgotten God this staff was powered by the beliefs and sacrifices of the Forgotten Gods loyal yikarian followers, meaning that it could be used without expending a charge like other magical staves. The Staff of the World Pillars possessed 40 irreplaceable charges in the hands of anyone but the Forgotten God.
