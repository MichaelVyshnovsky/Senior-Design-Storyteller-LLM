        "mainbody": "The '''Tablets of Pharyssolnyth''', or the '''Pharyssolnyth Tablets''', were a collection of writings by the [[silver dragon]] [[Pharyssolnyth]] of [[Yrlaphon]]. They detailed the secrets of [[dragon]] magic and were considered the definitive treatise on the subject.",
        "Description": "The Tablets consisted of thirty-seven large slates, obsidian black, with one side polished smooth and the other rough and natural. They seemed strange in appearance and strange to feel. They were in fact the permanently enlarged scales of a [[black dragon]].\n\nAppearing blank, the polished sides were actually covered with minute, invisible etchings and scrawls, in a form of tactile writing unknown to any race that once inhabited [[Myth Drannor]], but eventually considered to be a form of [[Draconic language|Draconic]]. Either way, it was extremely difficult to notice and read, needing close examination and a sensitive touch. On the raw sides, meanwhile, the elven examiners recorded their translations, notes, and theories in ancient [[moon elf|moon]] [[elven language|elvish]], and these were almost as hard to read.",
        "History": "Pharyssolnyth dwelt in the elven city of [[Yrlaphon]], among the eastern woodlands of [[Cormanthor]], in the first century after its founding in {{Yearlink|-1535}}. There she recorded the tablets that were named for her.\n\nFollowing the fall of Yrlaphon in {{Yearlink|-722}}, the [[Srinshee]] took the Tablets with her to [[Srinshinnar]]. When Srinshinnar also fell, the Srinshee and the survivors carried the tablets with them to [[Cormanthor]].\n\nThe Tablets of Pharyssolnyth then came into the possession of [[Windsong Tower]] in [[Myth Drannor]] when the Srinshee accepted a place among the Tower Elders there. There they remained as late as [[650 DR]].\n\nThey were still at Windsong Tower in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were kept in the libraries of Windsong Aerie, but after being threatened by the [[Shadovar]], the tower's custodian and guardian [[Darcassan]] relocated them to the vault of Shadowsong Tree, but he would allow heroes battling the Shadovar to examine them.<ref group=\"note\">''Anauroch: The Empire of Shade'', pages 87–89, allows for PCs to take the Tablets of Pharyssolnyth to Candlekeep and use them as the price of admission, but it is unclear how or why the PCs would receive them, and this event is only optional. It should be noted that the Tablets' presence at Candlekeep prompts a hint from the silver dragon ghost [[Miirym]].",
        "Research": "In their time, the Tablets of Pharyssolnyth had been kept hidden for centuries. The Srinshee and other researchers also spent long ages examining them. It took several centuries just to determine that the Tablets were fashioned from enlarged black-dragon scales, and many years after to find the carvings. Examiners spent nearly four centuries studying and interpreting them, inscribing their translations and notes on the backs of the scales, as they were by the mid–7{{th}} century [[DR]]. Referring to them on any matter required the skill to read both the draconic and elvish scripts, and took some ten minutes, while it took a full [[tenday]] of study to examine them all.",
        "Contents": "The Tablets were a treatise on how [[dragon]]s understood, learned, and practiced [[magic]], whether as [[spell]]s or in [[magic item]]s. All in all, it was a trove of lore on dragonkind, knowledge precious in its own right.\n\nAny non-dragon who managed to read all the Tablets gained great insights into the powers of dragons, their attitudes towards magic and its casting, and an enhanced ability to resist magic used by dragons. They could grant this last benefit but once a century."
