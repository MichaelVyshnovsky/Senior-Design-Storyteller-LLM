'''''Terrilan's Crimson Wand''''' was a dangerous [[elf|elven]] magic [[wand]].

==Description==
''Terrilan's Crimson Wand's'' rod was noticeably shorter than that of an average wand's. The wand was crimson in color.

==Powers==
This wand allowed the user to cast the ''[[finger of death]]'' spell. Additionally, it dramatically enhanced the user's charisma at the cost of reduced fortitude.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], this crimson-colored rod could be found among treasures of a [[dark naga]] that laired in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]], along with a piece of the broken ''Orrery'' from the [[Speculum Grounds]]. The naga's treasure hoard also included  an ''[[idolon]]'', a strange magical stone head, ''[[Kluusar's Chain of Warding]]'' and an enchanted [[full plate]] armor.
