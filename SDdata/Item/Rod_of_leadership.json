        "Powers": "Coveted by warriors and priests alike, the ''rod of leadership'' inspired all those within 120 yards (110 m) of the wielder with fanatical loyalty and morale.\n\nThose within 30 yards (27 m) of the wielder were completely immune to all forms of magically induced ''[[fear]]''.\n\nWhen wielded as a weapon, the rod of leadership could paralyze targets at the will of the wielder, though using this power drained the rod of all magical properties.",
