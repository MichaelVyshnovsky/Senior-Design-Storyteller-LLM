A '''mess kit''' was a compact collection of essential [[cutlery]] and kitchen implements that allowed preparation and consumption of food while traveling.

==Description==
A typical mess kit consisted of a metal container whose sides worked as a cooking pan and as a plate or bowl. The container stored a cup and basic cutlery while on the road.

Special mess kits were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', that also included three [[vial]]s for holding [[spices]].
