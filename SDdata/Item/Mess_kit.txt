A mess kit was a compact collection of essential cutlery and kitchen implements that allowed preparation and consumption of food while traveling.
A typical mess kit consisted of a metal container whose sides worked as a cooking pan and as a plate or bowl. The container stored a cup and basic cutlery while on the road.
Special mess kits were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, that also included three vials for holding spices.
