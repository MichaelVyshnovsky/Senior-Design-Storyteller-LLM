A '''whipsting''' was a special type of [[sword]] originating from [[southeast Faerûn]], in a land south of [[Unther]].

It was very slender, enabling it to be used as a [[whip]] as well as a sword.

The famed mercenary [[Gayrlana]], "Lady Bloodsword", specialized in this exotic weapon by [[1356 DR]].
