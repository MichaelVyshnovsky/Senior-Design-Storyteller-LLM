        "mainbody": "'''Kane's jo stick''' was a pure white [[jo stick]], carried by Grandmaster [[Kane]]. It was formed from a branch of the [[White Tree]]<ref> that grew in the courtyard of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]'s Castle in [[Bloodstone Village]] on the shore of [[Lake Midai]].\n\nIt was said that in the hands of Kane, this white stick was as hard as [[adamantine]] and could shatter stone. Also, it never got dirty or dusty from use as a walking stick."
