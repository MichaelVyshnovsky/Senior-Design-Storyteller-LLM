It was formed from a branch of the White Tree that grew in the courtyard of Gareth Dragonsbanes Castle in Bloodstone Village on the shore of Lake Midai.\nIt was said that in the hands of Kane, this white stick was as hard as adamantine and could shatter stone. Also, it never got dirty or dusty from use as a walking stick."
