The '''''molten orbs''''' were a set of metal spheres that were crafted and [[enchanted]] by [[Coriolis Rillevay]] for use in battle. It could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The central and largest orb had a fiery core that glowed through cracks in the surface, while two smaller and solid orbs orbited around it. The entire constellation of the ''molten orbs'', in turn, would either float above the wielder's head or orbit around them from beyond arm's reach.

==Powers==
The ''molten orbs'' could be directed to launch an injurious beam of fire at a target, and seemingly at random, it might choose to also fire additional beams at other targets as well.

==Notable Owners==
