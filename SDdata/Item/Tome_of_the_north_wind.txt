A '''''tome of the north wind''''' was a [[book]] that held the power of [[elemental ice]] [[magic]].

==Description==
The book was always coated in a thin layer of frost irrespective of any heat applied to it.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Arts|26}}

Any given ''tome of the north wind'' contained a couple of [[wizard]] [[spell]]s themed around ice and [[cold]].

==Powers==
A wizard could channel their offensive ice magic through the ''tome'', which empowered the magic to inflict greater harm. Once per day, they could also instantly activate a spell contained within the ''tome''.
