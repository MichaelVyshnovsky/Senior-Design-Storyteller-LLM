        "mainbody": "'''Thieves' tools''' encompassed a wide array of equipment that aided a prospective [[rogue]] during their illicit activities. Many of these items were hand-crafted by the individual who intended to use them, but some were available through local guilds or even from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].",
        "Description": "A typical set of thieves' tools included a small [[file]], a set of [[lockpicks]], a small [[hand mirror|mirror]], scissors, and [[pliers]], which were meant to assist in picking [[lock (item)|locks]] and disarming traps.\n\nPossession of some thieves' tools was enough evidence for local authorities to invite the rogue for a stay in the dungeon."
