Papers and Paychecks was a role-playing game.
In it, players adopted the roles of students and workers in a fantasy world with a technological and industrialized society. It was played with papers, pencils, and at least two six-sided dice. It seemed fun.
Karl Chisolm, a thirteen-year-old boy of Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, spent his spare time playing Papers and Paychecks with his friends.
