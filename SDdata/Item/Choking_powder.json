        "mainbody": "Choking powder was a substance used as an incapacitating thrown weapon.\nThis purple powder was mixed using several herbs and packed in throwable pouches.\nUpon impact, choking powder pouches opened up, creating a small stinking cloud that dazed and caused uncontrollable coughing fits in those caught in it. The powder cloud lasted for thirty seconds.\nThese devious items became popular in Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR. These pouches were quite common in the Daggerford, Delimbiyr Vale in 1372 DR."
