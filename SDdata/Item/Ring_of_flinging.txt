'''''Rings of flinging''''' were [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s that improved the wearer's skills and aim with flinging and throwing.

==Powers==
Some of these rings were bands inlaid with [[rubies]]. The ring made the wearer stronger and more powerful when throwing things at their opponents, dealing increased damage.

==History==
Historically, ''rings of flinging'' were used by organizations like the [[Harpers]], who often preferred to stay out of a blade's reach and often found themselves chasing or being chased across the rooftops during moonlit nights. These rings allowed the Harper agents to end wrongdoers with good aim and a loose roof tile. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such ring was being offered for sale by [[Arron]], a [[lightfoot halfling]] [[druid]] traders of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
