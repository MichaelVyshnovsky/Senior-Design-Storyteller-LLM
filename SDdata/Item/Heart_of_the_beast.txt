'''''Hearts of the beast''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] food created by the [[cleric]]s of [[Malar]].

==Description==
These items were created using the hearts of predatory beasts. Once extracted, the hearts were smoked and cured using [[Malarite]] divine magics.

==Powers==
In order to activate its enchantment, a ''heart of the beast'' had to be consumed completely. The eater was granted a boon of Malar's divine magic similar to the ''[[divine power]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
Even though ''hearts of the beast'' were items created by Malarite clergy, by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they could be seen in the hands of individuals not associated with the [[Cult of Malar]].
