        "mainbody": "'''''Flame's Forge''''' was a significantly oversized enchanted [[tower shield]] that originated from a lost tomb in [[Anauroch]].",
        "Powers": "''Flame's Forge'' not only protected its owner from physical attacks like any other shield, but also made them resistant to heat and fire-based abilities and spells.",
        "History": "A thief whose name was lost to history uncovered ''Flame's Forge'' in one of the tombs in the scorching sands of Anauroch. The thief was able to survive the desert thanks to the colossal shield's enchantments. Later, the same thief returned to Anauroch armed with the ''Forge'' and a small gang of bandits to prey on travelers and merchant caravans traveling through the hot sands. The raiding continued for months until the thief was slain not far from the tomb that ''Flame's Forge'' was recovered from.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]] , ''Flame's Forge'' reached the blacksmith [[Derval Ironeater]] of [[Daggerford]], where the enchanted shield was available for purchase."
