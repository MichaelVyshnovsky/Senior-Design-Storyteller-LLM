        "mainbody": "Flames Forge was a significantly oversized enchanted tower shield that originated from a lost tomb in Anauroch.\nFlames Forge not only protected its owner from physical attacks like any other shield, but also made them resistant to heat and fire-based abilities and spells.\nA thief whose name was lost to history uncovered Flames Forge in one of the tombs in the scorching sands of Anauroch. The thief was able to survive the desert thanks to the colossal shields enchantments. Later, the same thief returned to Anauroch armed with the Forge and a small gang of bandits to prey on travelers and merchant caravans traveling through the hot sands. The raiding continued for months until the thief was slain not far from the tomb that Flames Forge was recovered from.\nBy 1372 DR , Flames Forge reached the blacksmith Derval Ironeater of Daggerford, where the enchanted shield was available for purchase."
