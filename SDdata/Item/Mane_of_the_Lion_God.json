        "Powers": "These [[Nobanionite]] cloaks were imbued with the Lord Firemane's divine magics increasing the wearer's defense when fighting creatures venerating chaos. Additionally, the wearer became unaffected by normal and magical ''[[fear]]''.",
        "History": "''Manes of the Lion-God'' were worn with great pride by the [[druids]] of Nobanion who warred against [[lycanthrope]] servants of [[Malar]], Nobanion's enemy. These clocks served as reminders that there was order even in nature. As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Nobanionite religion started spreading outside the Gulthmere Forest, along with the church, ''Manes of the Lion-God'' started appearing in regions other than the [[Vilhon Reach]]. One such cloak was being sold by a druid merchant who did business on the [[Market Triangle]] in Westgate."
