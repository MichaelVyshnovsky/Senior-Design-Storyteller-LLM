'''Waterstar''', also called achroite or colorless [[tourmaline]], was a rare [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]].

==Description==
Waterstar was a colorless and transparent gemstone. Gem-quality stones had to be flawless and could yield large faceted jewels that sparkled.

==Powers==
Waterstar, like all tourmalines, could absorb any spell cast upon it and immediately convert it into three ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' that blasted outward from the crystal facets. This act consumed the gem in the process.
