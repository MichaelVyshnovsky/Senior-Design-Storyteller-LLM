Blade of Aihonen was the sword of the hero Aihonen.
Even broken, the blade was extremely sharp.
Around 1181 DR on the banks of Lac Dinneshere, the hero Aihonen fought against the last white dragon matriarch of the Spine of the World Icasaracht. During the battle, Aihonen was slain, but before his death, he drove the sword through the heart of the foul beast. In Mirtul, 1281 DR, the sea spirit Elisia gave the shattered blade to Aihonens relative, Jhonen.
