'''Blade of Aihonen''' was the [[sword]] of the hero [[Aihonen]].

==Description==
Even broken, the [[blade]] was extremely sharp.

==History==
Around [[1181 DR]] on the banks of [[Lac Dinneshere]], the hero Aihonen fought against the last [[white dragon]] matriarch of the [[Spine of the World]] [[Icasaracht]]. During the battle, Aihonen was slain, but before his death, he drove the sword through the heart of the foul beast. In [[Mirtul]], [[1281 DR]], the sea spirit [[Elisia]] gave the shattered blade to Aihonen's relative, [[Jhonen]].
