        "mainbody": "A '''''hornblade''''' was a [[magic weapon]] that produced a bladed weapon from a small piece of horn.",
        "Description": "Even on close inspection, nine times out of a ten, a ''hornblade'' appeared to just be a simple piece of animal horn, {{SIrange|6|15|in|c|long=yes}} long, set into a handle or grip. But when a particular spot was pressed just so, the horn would extend into a curved [[sickle]]-shaped blade that was quite sturdy and sharp. They varied in size, from [[knives]] and [[dagger]]s to [[scimitar]]s.",
        "Powers": "As magical weapons, ''hornblades'' of knife and dagger size were typically ''+1'' or ''+2'', while those of scimitar size were often ''+2'' or ''+3'' in strength. They could be wielded the same way and with the same training as their conventional counterparts. Smaller ''hornblades'' could also be thrown just like regular knives and daggers could be. The blade could be retracted after use.\n\nIf examined with ''[[detect magic]]'' or the like, an unactivated ''hornblade'' revealed an aura of faint [[enchantment]] magic.",
        "History": "A {{SIAdj|9|in|c|long=yes|adj=long}} dagger-sized ''+2 hornblade'' was in the possession of the [[duergar]] soldiers of [[Deepearth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}.<ref>",
