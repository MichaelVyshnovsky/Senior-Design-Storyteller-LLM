The '''''treads of falling shadow''''' were a pair of magical [[boots]]s recovered from the agents of [[Thultanthar]] near [[Greenweald Lane]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|These black leather boots seem to cause your shadow to warp and twist, almost as if it were alive.
}}
==Powers==
The boots made the wearer partially incorporeal and shadowy, causing threats to pass right through them. It also made them exceptionally quick and agile as they raced about.

==History==
The boots were recovered from [[Shadovar]] agents around Greenweald Lane, who attempted to recover a piece of the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' from the [[Harpers]].
