The treads of falling shadow were a pair of magical bootss recovered from the agents of Thultanthar near Greenweald Lane during the mid-1480s DR.
The boots made the wearer partially incorporeal and shadowy, causing threats to pass right through them. It also made them exceptionally quick and agile as they raced about.
The boots were recovered from Shadovar agents around Greenweald Lane, who attempted to recover a piece of the Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll from the Harpers.
