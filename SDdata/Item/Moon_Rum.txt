Moon Rum was a brand of alcoholic beverage produced by Moon Mountain Brewery, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Moon Rum was a strong, fiery drink that was anything but subtle.
Moon Rum was not very popular as a straight drink. It was available in hand kegs only at the brewery or in Secomber. It was very popular as a mixer for making ale flips and was even sold in topkegs in the correct proportion with Moon Mountain Ale.
