A '''''Red Wizard blade''''' was a potent type of [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] used by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}}{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} They were notorious, owing to the fact that no [[cleric]] could save an individual slain with one.

==Description==
These daggers were made of [[steel]]. They had a narrow blade and a grim design.

==Powers==
''Red Wizard blades'' drew power from the [[Negative Energy plane]] to unleash harmful [[necromantic]] energies upon any being struck by it. The veins of those injured by a ''Red Wizard blade'' became visible and black beneath the skin. Such injuries killed the victim readily, and they could not be [[Raise dead|raised]] or [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]] by any normal means short of [[deity|divine intervention]] or the use of a ''[[tablet of reawakening]]''.

==History==
The blades were designed and crafted by the Red Wizards using processes known only to them. In response to their use of such potent necromancy, the [[Wychlaran|Witches]] of [[Rashemen]]&mdash;longtime enemies of the Red Wizards&mdash;devised the ''tablet of reawakening''.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some Thayan agents in the [[Sword Coast]] region were known to carry these blades. Following the capture of one of their own by the [[Harpers]] in the mid-1480s DR, Red Wizards tracked one of the agents, [[Edgin Darvis]], to his home in [[Targos]] and used the dagger to slay his wife, [[Zia]]. Eleven years after this event, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Edgin's longtime friend [[Holga Kilgore]] was also slain with a ''Red Wizard blade'' wielded by the Red Wizard [[Sofina]]. Fortunately, Edgin was able to use a ''tablet of reawakening'' to revive her.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Sofina]], a Red Wizard active on the Sword Coast on behalf of [[Szass Tam]] as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
