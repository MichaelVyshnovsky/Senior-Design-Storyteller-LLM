A Red Wizard blade was a potent type of enchanted dagger used by the Red Wizards of Thay as of the late 15 century DR. They were notorious, owing to the fact that no cleric could save an individual slain with one.
These daggers were made of steel. They had a narrow blade and a grim design.
Red Wizard blades drew power from the Negative Energy plane to unleash harmful necromantic energies upon any being struck by it. The veins of those injured by a Red Wizard blade became visible and black beneath the skin. Such injuries killed the victim readily, and they could not be raised or resurrected by any normal means short of divine intervention or the use of a tablet of reawakening.
The blades were designed and crafted by the Red Wizards using processes known only to them. In response to their use of such potent necromancy, the Witches of Rashemen&mdashlongtime enemies of the Red Wizards&mdashdevised the tablet of reawakening.
By the late 15 century DR, some Thayan agents in the Sword Coast region were known to carry these blades. Following the capture of one of their own by the Harpers in the mid-1480s DR, Red Wizards tracked one of the agents, Edgin Darvis, to his home in Targos and used the dagger to slay his wife, Zia. Eleven years after this event, in the late 1490s DR, Edgins longtime friend Holga Kilgore was also slain with a Red Wizard blade wielded by the Red Wizard Sofina. Fortunately, Edgin was able to use a tablet of reawakening to revive her.
