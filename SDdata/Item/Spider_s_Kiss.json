        "Powers": "The blade of this scimitar was constantly coated with potent dark oozing [[spider]] [[poison]]. Additionally, the ''Spider's Kiss'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that increased the damage and guided the wielder's hand towards their target.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the so-called King of Spiders â€“ [[Sirachna]], gained entrance to a home on Westgate's [[Market Triangle]] from a cavern underneath. His arachnid pets ended up murdering a family who lived inside, leaving them haunting the home as restless [[ghost]]s. Some said the King of Spiders was killed by an adventurer, accompanied by [[Charissa Maernos]], [[Mantides]], and [[Rinara]], who claimed the ''Spider's Kiss'' and several other magic items."
