Cast-off armor was armor that was magically enchanted to become exceedingly quick for its wearer to doff.
Any type of armor could be enchanted to become cast-off armor.
While normal armor took between 1 and 5 minutes to remove depending on its complexity, cast-off armor could be completely removed within only a few seconds, regardless of type.
