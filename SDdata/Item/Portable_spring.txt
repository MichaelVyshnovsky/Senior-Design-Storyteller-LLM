The portable spring was a magic item that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Portable springs appeared as blue pieces of cloth.
When placed upon the ground, this item became a spring of fresh water, providing up to 200 gallons (760 liters) of fresh water per day. The portable spring could be picked up and moved easily, reverting back to a piece of blue cloth whenever it was not resting upon the ground.
