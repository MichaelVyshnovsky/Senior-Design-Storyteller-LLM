'''Spetum'''s were a type of [[spear]] similar to [[ranseur]]s.{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|27}}

==Description==
Spetums were roughly similar in appearance to ranseurs, having a pair of sharp tapering points Though their shafts were generally shorter, at around {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length. They also sometimes had their side blades angled backwards.

==Weaponology==
Like all spears, the primary function of spetums was to be thrusted at and pierce their foes. Their design's secondary capability was deflecting attacks, as well as catching and holding foes at a distance when penetration wasn't achieved.

==Notable Users==
