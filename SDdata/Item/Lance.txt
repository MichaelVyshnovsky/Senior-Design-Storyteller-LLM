A lances were a long member of the spear family of polearms, specially designed for use in mounted combat.
The design of these spears varied between cultures, but they generally consisted of a long shaft made of tough wood with an iron head shaped like a laurel. These spearheads had cutting edges and a sharp point meant to penetrate armor. Also fitted to the shaft, just behind where a wielder would grip the lance, was the "graper" &mdash a thick leather ring that acted as a stop against the wielders armpit. This was meant to halt any rearward momentum brought about by impacts.
Lances were meant to be aimed diagonally above a mounts neck and gripped close to their bottom end, the latter of which was meant to put a great distance between their wielder and a target. Is aimed diagonally above the horses neck. If a lance was too heavy for the mount being ridden upon, its effectiveness would be reduced.

Jousting Lance The "jousting lance", was a type of lance designed for use in jousting tournaments. These measured  in length and weighed around . They were typically made of light wood that could easily be broken and as a consequence were designed to widen outward, thus protecting their wielder from any wood shards or splinters. The head of a tourney lance was made of either metal or wood. Instead of ending in a sharp point, these heads were fitted with short, blunt, three-pronged projections. This blunt tip design was meant to lessen the force of impact and prevent the lance from penetrating armor, thus decreasing chances of injury. However, tourney lances could still potentially cause fatalities if used at full tilt.
