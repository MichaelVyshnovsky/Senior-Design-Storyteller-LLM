A '''lances''' were a long member of the [[spear]] family of [[polearm]]s, specially designed for use in [[mount]]ed combat.<ref>

==Description==
The design of these spears varied between cultures, but they generally consisted of a long shaft made of tough wood with an [[iron]] head shaped like a [[bay leaf|laurel]]. These spearheads had cutting edges and a sharp point meant to penetrate [[armor]]. Also fitted to the shaft, just behind where a wielder would grip the lance, was the "graper" &mdash; a thick leather ring that acted as a stop against the wielder's armpit. This was meant to halt any rearward momentum brought about by impacts.

==Weaponology==
Lances were meant to be aimed diagonally above a mount's neck and gripped close to their bottom end, the latter of which was meant to put a great distance between their wielder and a target. Is aimed diagonally above the horse's neck. If a lance was too heavy for the mount being ridden upon, its effectiveness would be reduced.

Without the aid of [[stirrup]]s, a lance had to be wielded with two hands Prior to the invention of stirrups, lancers fought by stabbing overhand or even throwing the weapon.

It was common for lances to be tossed aside once their wielder became engaged in close quarters combat.

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|1300|NY}}, the lance was first adopted by many cultures on [[Toril]]. The adoption of lances as mounted weaponry was directly linked to the adoption of stirrups many years prior.

In [[1360 DR]], in the [[Battle of the Fissures]], the [[Bedine]] fought against the [[asabi]] with lances.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], one could find some fighters in the [[Sword Coast North]] wielding lances that were made from [[titansteel]].<ref>

==Varieties of Lances==
Lances were divided into three classes of size and weight, designating what kind of mounts they were suitable to be used with &mdash; light, medium, and heavy. For example, light [[warhorse]]s could only handle light lances.

Each lance was heavier and longer than the last. Measuring {{SI|10|ft}}, {{SI|12|ft}}, and {{SI|14|ft}} in length respectively; weighing around {{SI|5|lbs.|k}}, {{SI|10|lbs.|k}}, and {{SI|15|lbs.|k}} respectively.

;Jousting Lance: The "jousting lance", was a type of lance designed for use in [[jousting]] tournaments. These measured {{SI|13|ft}} in length and weighed around {{SI|20|lbs.|k}}. They were typically made of light wood that could easily be broken and as a consequence were designed to widen outward, thus protecting their wielder from any wood shards or splinters. The head of a tourney lance was made of either metal or wood. Instead of ending in a sharp point, these heads were fitted with short, blunt, three-pronged projections. This blunt tip design was meant to lessen the force of impact and prevent the lance from penetrating armor, thus decreasing chances of injury. However, tourney lances could still potentially cause fatalities if used at full tilt.
