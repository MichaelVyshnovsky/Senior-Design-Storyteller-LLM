        "mainbody": "Fakers Crown was the enchanted decoy headdress that belonged to a king whose name was lost to time.\nFakers Crown carried several enchantments that enhanced the wearers senses. While it was worn, it improved the wearers hearing and allowed them to cast amplify and clairaudience/clairvoyance spells once per day each.\nEven though the name of the king who commissioned this crown was lost to time, the story was not. The king ordered the creation of Fakers Crown after realizing that his advisers were plotting a coup. In secrecy, the king replaced the real crown with Fakers Crown just before the coronation. The enchanted headwear allowed the king to crack the conspiracy and capture the treasonous aides. Following that event, Fakers Crown became a supplemental symbol of regency.\nSometime later, a rogueish traveling bard swapped the fake and real crowns, leaving the Fakers Crown in the vault. The same night, she performed for the king. He was so mesmerized by the bards music that he offered her anything from the castles treasury. The woman claimed Fakers Crown and was never seen again.\nBy 1372 DR, the Fakers Crown fell into the hands of Feldran Exeltis of the Exeltis noble family, whose winery keep was located in the Blade Cliffs of the Sword Coast."
