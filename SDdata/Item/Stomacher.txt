A '''stomacher''' was a type of underbodice in [[Faer√ªn]], similar to a [[corset]], that was worn by women overtop of [[gown]]s or other silken dress.

==Description==
Stomachers were rigid garments that extended from crotch the wearer's crotch to their breast. Many offered support for a wearer's breasts as well as shaped panels for the hips. And stomachers that were made to cinch tight a wearer's waist tight were particularly popular.

[[Waterdhavian]] stomachers often swept the sides of the bodice into fanciful swirls and gave off pointed shoulders.

==Availability==
* [[Shyrrhr|Larelda Shyrrhr Mallowdar]] designed and made stomachers among many other types of clothing in [[Deepingdale]] in the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], until she was invited by Lord [[Piergeiron Paladinson]] to be a Lady of the Court in Waterdeep.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/02-20 - Shyrrhr}}

==History==
In the ancient past, stomachers could be found worn by [[elves]] in [[Cormanthyr]] and [[Myth Drannor]].<ref>

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, stomachers were a common element of fashion among younger Waterdhavian noble ladies. The stomachers worn by such women were of an open wire-work type, sporting elaborate filigree and designs, often set with [[gemstone]]s.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, silver-laced stomachers were all the rage among [[Selgaunt]]an noblewomen. Many wore them to the annual ball that was held on [[Hammer 30]] in [[Stormweather Towers]] by [[Thamalon Uskevren]] to commemorate his lost brother. Notable wearers at the ball included members of [[House Uskevren]], such as [[Shamur Uskevren]] wore a gold stomacher and her daughter [[Thazienne Uskevren]] who wore a bejeweled silver stomacher.
