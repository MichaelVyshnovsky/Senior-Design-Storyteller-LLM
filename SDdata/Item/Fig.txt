'''Figs''' were edible fruits found in warmer climate nations of [[Faerûn]] and in further, among the nations of [[Kara-Tur]]

==Cultivation==
Figs were known to be a sweet edible fruit as early as the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].

Fresh figs were grown in the [[West Faerûn]] nation of [[Calimshan]] and often consumed with [[flatbread]]s along with [[prune]]s, [[date]]s, dried [[pea]]s, and [[goat cheese]].

In a similar fashion, in [[Sembia]], figs were parts of feasts, served alongside other fruits and sweet-tasting meats, [[cheese]]s, white [[bread]], [[butter]], and pickled [[egg]]s. In the nearby kingdom of [[Cormyr]], dried figs were available, namely, in the town of [[Marsember]].

[[Dannath's Pickles, Nuts, & Foods]] in the city of [[Yartar]] sold dried southern fruits, including figs.

Just south of [[Riatavin]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] was located a rich [[Rhianna]] estate from which [[Thousandheads Trading Coster]] operated. The estate's grounds held massive acreages of fig and date orchards. [[Sunrise Orchards]] was another notable location that grew fig trees. Fresh figs were also a staple of [[Turmian]] cuisine.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220525002919/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_050607-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed May – Jul 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

Wild fig trees grew in the hot sands of [[Anauroch]] around the five [[Colored Waters]] lakes. The fruits were eaten raw, served with roasted [[hare]], and dried to be eaten as rations.

In the southern land of [[Halruaa]], [[sugar]]ed figs were a common sweet treat.

Sweet fig treats were served in [[Eltabbar]] for the [[Zulkir]]s and those who held power in [[Thay]]. [[Mulhorand]] and [[Great Vale]] cultivated fruits, including figs.

Figs were consumed by the [[Laska]] people of the [[Kilap Valley]] in [[Shou Lung]] during feasts of [[roast boar]] and fresh [[papaya]]s.

People of the [[Haunted Lands]] in [[Zakhara]] cultivated dates, figs, and [[pomegranate]]s. and grew in abundance on the isles of [[Masud Jazayir]].

==Usages==
Calimshan was known for its figs, pressed into a flat oval shape – a treat simply called [[fig cakes]].

In [[North Faerûn]], [[honey]]ed figs were among some of the most common preserves, kept in [[sealing wax|wax-sealed]] [[jar]]s.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov – Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Trivia==
Calishites made a hand gesture called the fig sign by placing a thumb between the middle fingers. That sign was believed to ward evil names off.
