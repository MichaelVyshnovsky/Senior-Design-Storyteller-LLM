'''''Spellblade''''' was a magical [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be applied to weapons, granting immunity to one [[spell]].

==Description==
This magical enchantment made the wielder of the weapon immune to a single spell of the weapon creator's choice, but only if it was directly targeted at the wielder. It had no effect on spells that covered a large area. The spell was absorbed by the weapon and the wielder could then choose to redirect the spell at a target of their choosing, or let it drain away harmlessly.

==Creation==
Creation of a ''spellblade'' weapon required a ''[[spell turning]]'' spell and typically increased the price of creating a weapon by 2,000 to 6,000 [[gold piece]]s.
