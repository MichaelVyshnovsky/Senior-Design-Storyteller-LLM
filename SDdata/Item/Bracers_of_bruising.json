        "Powers": "The bracers were enchanted to increase the wearer's strength and their physical presence, making it an easy task to intimidate others.",
        "History": "''Bracers of bruising'' were created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ordered to be enchanted by the leaders of the guild. The bracers were to inspire and promote cruelty amid the guild's street-level criminals. ''Bracers of bruising'' continuously changed hands for years, serving the most brattish and cruel of the Night Masks, but never the same person for long.\n\nDespite the ''bracers' of bruising'' not being ''cursed'' items, wearing them was dangerous as countless street thugs wanted to claim the bracers for themselves. Everyone wanted to be the \"Westgate's Biggest Thug\"."
