        "mainbody": "'''''Feather leather armor''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[light armor]], used in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Feather leather armor'' possessed a ''+2'' protective enchantment and provided the wearer with improved initiative in battle and movement speed. Its magics made the armor tougher than regular leather and practically weightless.",
        "History": "In the 15{{th}} century DR, ''feather leather armor'' could be found worn among the outlaws of the [[Sword Mountains]], and sold in the Mercenary Arms Depot of the city of [[Neverwinter]], as well as recovered from the ruins of the [[Old Owl Well]]. The pirates [[Kajin]] and her lieutenant [[Gadain]] both wore a set of these leathers."
