Morvian was a magical greatsword and one of the baneblades of Demron created in Myth Drannor.
It was a magnificent greatsword designed for folk of human, elf, or dwarf size, weighing 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms). It gave off a strong yellow light when drawn, resembling sunlight.
As one of baneblades, it was a +4 holy weapon that was a bane to both undead and evil outsiders. Morvian was also axiomatic and let its wielder use daylight once a day. In contrast to earlier baneblades, it could be used by members of any race, provided they were lawful good it was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.
It was crafted by the archmage Demron before the fall of Myth Drannor, and was the third of his series of Baneblades. 
Sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor, Morvian was stolen by a demon Rivener. In attempting to retrieve the Baneblade, a group of gold dragons failed to defeat the creature, instead sealing him under the Castle Cormanthor.
In 1369 DR, a group of adventurers from Phlan, guided by the ghost of Hachaam Selorn, defeated the powerful demon and retrieved the Baneblade Morvian to aid them in defeating the Cult of Dragon occupying the ruins of Myth Drannor.
