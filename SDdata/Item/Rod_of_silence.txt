A rod of silence was carved with symbols of cats paws and owls.
It gave the holder the ability to cast silence once per day on himself or herself, although the silence affected nobody else. Unless the silence was in effect, the holder could also use shout once per day. While the rod was being held, the holder was better able to resist sonic effects.
It was worth around 24,000 gold pieces.
