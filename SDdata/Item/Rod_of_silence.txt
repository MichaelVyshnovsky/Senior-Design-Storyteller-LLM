A '''''rod of silence''''' was carved with symbols of [[cat]]s' paws and [[owl]]s.

==Powers==
It gave the holder the ability to cast ''[[silence]]'' once per day on himself or herself, although the silence affected nobody else. Unless the silence was in effect, the holder could also use ''[[shout]]'' once per day. While the rod was being held, the holder was better able to resist sonic effects.

It was worth around 24,000 [[gold piece]]s.
