'''''Stones of Earth''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Choker (necklace)|chokers]] imbued with protective magics, found in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Each of these [[amulet]]s was a choker to be wrapped around a wearer's neck. It had a carving of a leaf decorating it and a small chunk of an [[earth mote]], living earth, was floating suspended at its center. The mote occasionally radiated green light and could not be hidden by clothes.

==Powers==
Despite their somewhat exotic appearance, ''Stones of Earth'' offered mild protection to the wearer and slightly boosted their ability to deflect incoming attacks.

==History==
These chokers were gifted to some of the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] following the battle in defense of Neverwinter in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
