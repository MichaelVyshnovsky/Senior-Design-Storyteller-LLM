        "mainbody": "A '''maca''' was a [[Maztica]]n [[club]], and [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "Macas were weapons shaped like elongated paddles of hard wood, wide and flat \"blades\" with razor sharp shards of [[obsidian]] lodged into their edges. They functioned as both: bludgeoning and slashing weapons.\n\nAlthough the maca was a fearsome weapon when used against Maztican warriors, they were no match for [[Amn]]nian [[steel]].",
        "Cultural Significance": "According to the creation myth of Maztica, [[Kukul]], an elder deity, sliced off his fingers with a maca. The fingers transformed into the first [[human]]s of the Maztican continent. Later, the clues deity of warfare – [[Zaltec]], used a maca to kill his mother – goddess [[Maztica (goddess)|Maztica]], the continent's namesake.",
        "History": "Macas became common used weapons in the [[Golden Age of Payit]], following the development of Maztican military. A maca was also instrumental in ending the Golden Age of Payit. [[Aliah]], the most beautiful princess of [[Payit]] was abducted by [[Tacal]], prince of [[Tulom-Itzi]], and beheaded in a fit of rage by his maca club. This tragedy was the true end of the country's Golden Age.",
