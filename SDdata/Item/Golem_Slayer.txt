The '''''Golem Slayer''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[adamantine]] [[warhammer]] created by [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent, a planeswalker from the city of [[Westgate]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
When the ''Golem Slayer'' was wielded against [[construct]]s, it effectively became a ''+1'' enchanted weapon. Additionally, the hammer dealt a small amount of sonic damage to its targets.

==History==
This enchanted warhammer was a minor curiosity created by Mintassan the Magnificent to keep "his children" in line. The ''Golem Slayer'' name was given to the weapon by its planeswalking creator. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the weapon was available for purchase from [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] in Westgate's [[Market Triangle]].
