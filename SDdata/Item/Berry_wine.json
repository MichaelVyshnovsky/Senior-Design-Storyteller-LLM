        "Availability": "The [[elves]] of [[Tall Trees]] in the  [[High Forest]] made a highly-alcoholic and very sweet berry wine. In the town of [[Targris]] in the [[Land of the Lions]], berry wine was notably salty sweet. Among the warehouse workers of [[Suzail]], weak but sweet berry wine was a popular libation. [[Montalar's Happy House]] in Suzail served its berry wine to wash down spicy brown sauce from the local specialty handfood – [[happy helm]]s."
