        "mainbody": "Berry wine was a wide variety of wines made using various berries. Alcohol content and taste of these wines varied greatly from recipe to recipe.\nThe elves of Tall Trees in the  High Forest made a highly-alcoholic and very sweet berry wine. In the town of Targris in the Land of the Lions, berry wine was notably salty sweet. Among the warehouse workers of Suzail, weak but sweet berry wine was a popular libation. Montalars Happy House in Suzail served its berry wine to wash down spicy brown sauce from the local specialty handfood â€“ happy helms."
