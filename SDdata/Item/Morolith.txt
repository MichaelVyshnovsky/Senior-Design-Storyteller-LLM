Morolith was an enchanted heavy warhammer from the Elven Catacombs underneath Myth Drannor.
The warhammer had a powerful +6 enchantment and boosted the wielders physical strength. Morolith also contained three charges of the cloudkill spell that could be unleashed at the wielders command.
Morolith was recovered and taken from the Elven Catacombs in the  by the marauders of the drow House Freth who allied with the Cult of the Dragon to smuggle ancient elven artifacts from the tombs. Morolith and many other magic items were stored in the catacomb level claimed by House Freth and used as a makeshift prison. The loot chests were protected by complex locks and deadly magical traps.
