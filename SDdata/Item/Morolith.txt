'''''Morolith''''' was an [[enchanted]] heavy [[warhammer]] from the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Myth Drannor]].

==Powers==
The warhammer had a powerful ''+6'' enchantment and boosted the wielder's physical strength. ''Morolith'' also contained three charges of the ''[[cloudkill]]'' [[spell]] that could be unleashed at the wielder's command.

==History==
''Morolith'' was recovered and taken from the Elven Catacombs in the {{YearlinkName|1369}} by the marauders of the [[drow]] [[House Freth]] who allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to smuggle ancient elven artifacts from the tombs. ''Morolith'' and many other magic items were stored in the catacomb level claimed by House Freth and used as a makeshift prison. The loot chests were protected by complex locks and deadly magical traps.
