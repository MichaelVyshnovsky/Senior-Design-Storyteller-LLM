'''''The Simbul's Sly Smile''''' was an [[enchanted]] item of wondrous power, allegedly gifted to [[Volothamp Geddarm]] by the Witch-Queen of [[Aglarond]] herself – [[The Simbul]].

==Description==
The magic item appeared to be nothing more than a simple rock, riddled with thin spiral carvings.

==Powers==
''The Simbul's Sly Smile'' possessed magics that reduced all harm done to the stone's owner. The enchantments remained active as long as the item remained in their possession.

==History==
Esteemed researcher, traveler, and writer, Volothamp Geddarm, angered many of [[Faerûn]]'s mages in the {{YearlinkName|1359}} when he published the infamous ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]''. Wizards felt that Volo exposed their secrets through the book and actively sought to punish the man. The Simbul of Aglarond was amused by the commotion caused by the hapless [[bard]]. She transformed Volo into a [[bird]] and made him fly into a wall as a punishment. The Witch-Queen dispensed some other magical chastisement on the writer, yet in the end, she gifted him an enchanted etched stone with a sly smile. The Simbul told Volo in a soft voice that his survival might depend on the stone's magic. She also warned the man that were he ever foolish enough to anger every spellcaster on [[Toril]], no trinket would be enough to save his hide.

Volothamp Geddarm carried the stone with him for years, until his fateful voyage to [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. While in the exotic new locale, Volo researched Samarach's customs, landmarks, and places of interest from the safety of [[Sa'Sani]]'s merchant outpost in [[Samargol]]. Volo showed interest in the locals' fear and paranoia over the dreaded [[yuan-ti]] and asked a group of mercenaries, who arrived in the region on the same note as he, to procure ancient yuan-ti stone tablets from a (not so) abandoned temple deep in the jungles north of the city. Were they mercenaries were successful, Volo was ready to gift them with ''The Simbul's Sly Smile''.
