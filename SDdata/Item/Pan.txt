'''Pans''' and '''skillets''' were common pieces of cookware found in [[Faerûn]], alongside [[pot]]s and [[cauldron]]s.

==Description==
A pan was a shallow dish used for frying or baking food. Magically enhancement for pans was usually a practical property relating to their use in cooking.

They were often crafted from plain [[iron]], and could be easily made by casting freshly smelted iron into a simple [[clay]] mold. Along with being polished and finished from the raw metal, they could be fitted with a metal or wooden handle.{{Cite dragon/316/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Black Dwarf Mine|74-77}}{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}
