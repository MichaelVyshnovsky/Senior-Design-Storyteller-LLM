        "mainbody": "Ball bearings were tiny metal balls that were used to hinder pursuers by forcing them to slow down and tread carefully or risk tripping and falling. Glass variants of these balls, known as marbles, were also used for that purpose.\nA pouch of 1000 metal ball bearings could be spread over an area equivalent to a square 10 ft (3 m) on a side to provide an effective coverage. A pouch of 24 was sufficient to cover an area of 5 ft.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold marbles in a pouches of a hundred for around 8 silver pieces.\n* Galandors Glassworks, a glass workshop in Kirinwood, made glass marbles among various other glass goods.\n* Pelauvirs Counter, a general store in Waterdeep, sold marbles among its miscellaneous goods.\n* Besides slipping up foes, ball bearings were sometimes used by those traversing dungeons to test for slopes and other irregularities.\n* Dead mans eyes required a pair of glass marbles, the same color as the spellcasters eyes, as a material component.\n* Shadow form required a black marble as a material component."
