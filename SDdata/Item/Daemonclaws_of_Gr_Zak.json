        "mainbody": "Daemonclaws of GrZak were unique enchanted bladed gauntlets from the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor.\nThese fierce bladed gauntlets dramatically boosted the wearers strength at the cost of their wisdom and imbued them with a +3 defensive enchantment. The gauntlets claws possessed a powerful +5 enchantment that caused severe offensive damage and helped guide the fists toward the targets. The wielder also was granted the ability to cast inflict critical wounds spell at will. Daemonclaws of GrZak held four charges of the spell.\nIn the , Daemonclaws of GrZak were among several powerful artifacts excavated from the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor by the agents of the drow House Freth. The gauntlets were locked in heavily trapped chests by the Freth drow and prepared to be shipped back to the Underdark, when a group of heroes â€“ the Veiled Ones, dismantled the drow operations allied with the Cult of the Dragon."
