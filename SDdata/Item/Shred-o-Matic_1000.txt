The '''Shred-o-Matic 1000''' was the unlucky [[potato]] peeling and dicing invention of [[Purfbin Doogrick]], created sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==History==
The Shred-o-Matic 1000 was created by young aspiring inventor Purfbin as he spent countless hours peeling potatoes in preparation for his burrow's annual grand feast, the [[New Harvest Festival]]. Purfbin convinced the event's Chief Cook [[Bitty Bitterbreath]] to present his grand invention to the panel of important guests that included the burrow's Mayor. The gnome fired the contraption up and guided it towards a pile of unpeeled potatoes, imagining the fame and respect the invention would bring him. Distracted, the youth lost control of Shred-o-Matic, and it went for the guests. The massacre resulted in the loss of [[Dame Edza]]'s prized wig and [[Mayor Whimblesnort]]'s expensive new [[silk]] hat. Doogrick's dreams of having his machine displayed at the [[High House of Wonders]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] alongside [[Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower]] and [[Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger]] were crushed while he was sent to peel potatoes alone in the cook's dark kitchens.
