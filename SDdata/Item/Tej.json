        "mainbody": "Tej, or tej, was an alcoholic beverage drunk in Chult, where it was more common and popular than beer or ale. \nIt was made from fermented honey and buckthorn, and had an amber hue. It was very sweet, which masked its fairly high alcohol content.\nIn Port Nyanzaru, a mug of tej cost 4 cp and a 1-gallon cask cost 2 sp, while in Fort Beluarian, a mug cost 6 cp and a cask cost 3 sp.\nIn the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, the sale of tej was controlled by the merchant prince Kwayoth√©."
