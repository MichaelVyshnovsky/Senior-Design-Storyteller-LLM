Harlyr () was the cheapest and the most common perfume found on the streets of Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
Harlyr was a clear, slightly oily red liquid that had no smell unless applied to bare skin. On most humanoidss skin, harlyr was absorbed and exuded a pleasant aroma of freshly bloomed roses for about three hours. When it was applied to the skin of half-orcs, orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins, harlyr turned black and released stench of charred goldflow.
The recipe for harlyr was commonly and correctly known as using nut oil, alcohol, and the sap of three types of common wildflowers.
