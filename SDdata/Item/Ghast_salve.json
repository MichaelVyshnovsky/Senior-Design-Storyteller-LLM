        "mainbody": "hast salve was an enchanted paste that offered protection from paralysis.\nGhast salve was a sickly verdant ointment that smelled quite pungent.\nThis salve offered total immunity from the paralysis associated with a ghasts touch when spread over the skin and granted the same paralyzing touch to the wearer if they touched others. The salve also made the wearer immune to the effects of the ghasts nauseating smell while also making them exude the same stench to others. Ghouls and ghasts viewed the wearer as one of their own while wearing this salve. The effects of ghast salve lasted for one hour after applied.\nAnyone wearing ghast salve could be burned if holy water was splashed upon them.\nPizentios, a necromancer from the isle of Sahu, carried some ghast salve."
