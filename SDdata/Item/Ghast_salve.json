        "mainbody": "'''''Ghast salve''''' was an [[enchanted]] paste that offered protection from paralysis.",
        "Descripion": "''Ghast salve'' was a sickly verdant ointment that smelled quite pungent.",
        "Powers": "This salve offered total immunity from the paralysis associated with a [[ghast]]'s touch when spread over the skin and granted the same paralyzing touch to the wearer if they touched others. The salve also made the wearer immune to the effects of the ghast's nauseating smell while also making them exude the same stench to others. [[Ghoul]]s and ghasts viewed the wearer as one of their own while wearing this salve. The effects of ''ghast salve'' lasted for one hour after applied.\n\nAnyone wearing ''ghast salve'' could be burned if [[holy water]] was splashed upon them.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Pizentios]], a [[necromancer]] from the isle of [[Sahu]], carried some ''ghast salve''."
