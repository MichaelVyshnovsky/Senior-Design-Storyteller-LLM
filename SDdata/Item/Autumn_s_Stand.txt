'''''Autumn's Stand''''' was a pair of [[enchanted]] [[boots]] worn by [[druid]]s. They could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
They had thin soles that crackled as the wearer walked, creating a similar sensation to walking on soft fallen leaves.

==Powers==
Wearers of these boots could move swiftly and confidently across any terrain without distraction, as if under the influence of a ''[[find the path]]'' spell.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] druid, was said to own a pair as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
