        "Description": "A speaking horn could be made of polished wood or [[leather]]. Leather horns were reinforced with [[iron]] hoops and could be disassembled for easier storing. [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold speaking horns of [[birch]]wood for 3 [[gold piece]]s and leather ones for 5.\n\nWhen the average speaker held the horn to their mouth, it could help project the voice so that listeners up to {{SI|100|yd|long=yes}} away could hear. Speakers with greater stamina for speaking could project their voices even farther. The sound could be heard in a 60-degree arc around the front of the speaker.",
        "Notable Owners": "Earl [[Ravenak]] and [[Tobiworth Hedgeblossom]], two rabble-rousers from [[Zazesspur]], each possessed speaking-tubes, which they used in their speeches.<ref name=\"WiT-pp92,103 />"
