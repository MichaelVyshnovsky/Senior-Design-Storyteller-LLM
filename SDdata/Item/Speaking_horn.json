        "mainbody": "A speaking horn, also called a speaking-tube,\nA speaking horn could be made of polished wood or leather. Leather horns were reinforced with iron hoops and could be disassembled for easier storing. Auroras Emporium sold speaking horns of birchwood for 3 gold pieces and leather ones for 5.\nWhen the average speaker held the horn to their mouth, it could help project the voice so that listeners up to  away could hear. Speakers with greater stamina for speaking could project their voices even farther. The sound could be heard in a 60-degree arc around the front of the speaker.\nEarl Ravenak and Tobiworth Hedgeblossom, two rabble-rousers from Zazesspur, each possessed speaking-tubes, which they used in their speeches."
