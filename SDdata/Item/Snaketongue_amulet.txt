Snaketongue amulets were enchanted amulets and holy symbol worn by members of the Snaketongue cult in the late 14 century DR.
These amulets, shaped like holy symbols of some strange new religion, possessed magics that protected the wearer from poisons, allowing them a higher chance to remain unaffected or shake the effects of poisons quicker.
In the , a snaketongue amulet was worn by Overlord Flamespar who attacked the Mines of Selgol in Samarach on behalf of the Snaketongue cult. Eventually, more agents and assassins of the mysterious organization that worshiped an interloper deity Zehir started appearing in the Sword Coast North and Samarach, attempting to undermine mercantile activities of merchant SaSani and a group of her mercenaries turned business partners.
