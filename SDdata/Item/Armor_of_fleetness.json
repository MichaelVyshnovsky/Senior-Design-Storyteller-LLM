        "Powers": "These sets of light armor held a potent ''+3'' enchantment  as well as allowed the wearer to magically ''[[haste]]'' themselves. An average ''armor of fleetness'' held fifty charges of the speedy spell.",
        "History": "Possibly the most notorious owner of an ''armor of fleetness'' was a poor [[rogue]] named [[Cromback]]. The thief was always seen wearing his magical leathers and used its magic quite often, fleeing from angry victims of his poor pickpocketing skills. However, the armor's magic did not save Cromback whom a victim who carried a [[bow]].\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], several sets of these enchanted armors could be found on the [[Sword Coast]] as well as in the [[Moonsea]] region."
