        "mainbody": "Armors of fleetness were enchanted leathers that granted the wearer unnatural speed.\nThese sets of light armor held a potent +3 enchantment  as well as allowed the wearer to magically haste themselves. An average armor of fleetness held fifty charges of the speedy spell.\nPossibly the most notorious owner of an armor of fleetness was a poor rogue named Cromback. The thief was always seen wearing his magical leathers and used its magic quite often, fleeing from angry victims of his poor pickpocketing skills. However, the armors magic did not save Cromback whom a victim who carried a bow.\nBy 1372 DR, several sets of these enchanted armors could be found on the Sword Coast as well as in the Moonsea region."
