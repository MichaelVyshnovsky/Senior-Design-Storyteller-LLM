A '''''storm scepter''''' was a magical device known in [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]].

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Glarald Starym]] furtively used [[Ulreiyn Starym]]'s ''storm scepter'', applying a spell to control it alongside other wands from afar, to fight against several [[unicorn]]s, [[Aubaudameira Dree]], and [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithryl]]'s agents, the [[Srinshee]] and [[Earynspieir]], after their mind-reading revealed one of his ploys. The scepter was destroyed in the confrontation.
