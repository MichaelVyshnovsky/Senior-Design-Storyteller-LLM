A storm scepter was a magical device known in Cormanthor.
In , Glarald Starym furtively used Ulreiyn Staryms storm scepter, applying a spell to control it alongside other wands from afar, to fight against several unicorns, Aubaudameira Dree, and Coronal Eltargrim Irithryls agents, the Srinshee and Earynspieir, after their mind-reading revealed one of his ploys. The scepter was destroyed in the confrontation.
