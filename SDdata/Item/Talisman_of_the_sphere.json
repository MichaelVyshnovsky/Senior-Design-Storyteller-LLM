        "mainbody": "A talisman of the sphere was an enchanted piece of jewelry that made it easier for a spellcaster to control a sphere of annihilation.\nThese small adamantine loops had a small handle.\nThese items were not only useless to non-wizards, the would actually cause physical harm to any non-wizard who held them. When held by a wizard concentrating on controlling a sphere of annhilation, a talisman of the sphere increased the wizards chance of success. However, if the wizard was unable to gain control over the sphere of annhilation, it would proceed to move toward the wizard at its maximum speed. A wand of negation targeted at a talisman of the sphere would negate the control.\n* Acererak, the demilich creator of the Tomb of the Nine Gods.\n* Emirikol, a plane-traveling wizard, carried a talisman of the sphere.\n* Marian Wicksal, a wizard and one of the operators of the Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility, carried a talisman of the sphere that she had obtained in her adventuring days from the horde of a red dragon."
