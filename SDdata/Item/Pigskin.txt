Pigskin was the skin of pigs. It was also known as pork rind.
The skin of pigs was notably thick with fat, and could be fried and eaten as pork "cracklings", which were enjoyed in Cormyr.
Pigskin could be tanned to use as a material for making pouches&mdashsuch as for coin purses or thieves tools&mdashwhich was popular in the Border Kingdoms. Tanned pigskin was also used for upholstery&mdashsuch as for cushions&mdashalthough this was seen as a low status material. This was known to be used by swineherds in The Vast.
Pork rind was also used as a material component in the grease spell.
A  piece of pork rind intended for wizards spell component pouches sold for 3 copper pieces from Auroras Emporium in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
At The Old Oyster restaurant in Monksblade, fried pigskin was used to encase their "old wyvern tail", a dish meant to imitate wyvern meat.
