'''Pigskin''' was the skin of [[pig]]s. It was also known as '''pork rind'''.

==Uses==
The skin of pigs was notably thick with [[Pork fat|fat]], and could be fried and eaten as pork "cracklings", which were enjoyed in [[Cormyr]].

Pigskin could be tanned to use as a material for making [[pouch]]es&mdash;such as for coin purses or [[thieves]]' tools&mdash;which was popular in the [[Border Kingdoms]]. Tanned pigskin was also used for upholstery&mdash;such as for cushions&mdash;although this was seen as a low status material. This was known to be used by [[swineherd]]s in [[The Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|14}}

Pork rind was also used as a [[material component]] in the ''[[grease]]'' spell.

==Availability==
A {{SIAdj|6|square inch|c|long=yes}} piece of pork rind intended for [[wizard]]s' [[spell component pouch]]es sold for 3 [[copper piece]]s from [[Aurora's Emporium]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

At [[The Old Oyster]] restaurant in [[Monksblade]], fried pigskin was used to encase their "[[old wyvern tail]]", a dish meant to imitate [[wyvern]] meat.
