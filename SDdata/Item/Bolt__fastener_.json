        "mainbody": "'''Bolts''' and '''nuts''' were metal fasteners that were used in metalworking, carpentry, and construction. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included [[nail]]s, [[spike]]s, and [[peg]]s.",
        "Description": "Bolts were typically less than {{SIAdj|8|inch|c|long=yes}} long and {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} or less in diameter. Their most important feature was their [[Wikipedia:screw_thread|thread]], which allowed a [[Wikipedia:nut (hardware)|nut]] to attach and hold the materials in place.\n\nA similar, simpler fastener was the '''link bolt''', a [[Wikipedia:Clevis fastener|clevis pin]] that had no thread and instead used an eyehole and pin to hold the rod in place, often tightened with the insertion of [[Wikipedia:Shim (spacer)|shims]].",
        "Availability": "[[File:Ship Bolts.png|thumb|''A fine bolt.'']]\n''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of bolts, nuts, and related tools in various configurations and sizes. Bolts were available from {{SIAdj|8|inch|c|long=yes}} long and able to be cut to length, in ¼\", ½\", ¾\", and {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} diameters for 3 [[gp]]/lb, and with fine and coarse threads. Variously-fitted nuts were available for 2 gp/lb.\n\nFor the most part, around the 1370s [[DR]] finely-made threaded [[screw]]s and bolts were treated as \"holy secrets of [[Gond]]\" and used in temples, furniture, and devices built and owned by that faith. Link bolts were far more common, with [[human]], [[dwarf]], and [[gnome]] smiths producing them widely across the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Shining Sea]] of western [[Faerûn]]."
