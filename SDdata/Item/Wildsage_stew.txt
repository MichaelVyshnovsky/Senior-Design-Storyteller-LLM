Wildsage stew was a simple meal commonly eaten by farmers of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The stew was a thick mixture into which game from the forests of the Vast were stirred, including cooked chunks of squirrel, boar, porcupine, and black-masked bear. This was flavored with wildsage, imparting a taste of buttered leek. It was often eaten in accompaniment with hardbread slathered in bloodlick, and washed down with beer.
A similar dish was wildsage vegetable stew, which was served at The Wizards Hand inn.
