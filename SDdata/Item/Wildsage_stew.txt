'''Wildsage stew''' was a simple meal commonly eaten by farmers of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The stew was a thick mixture into which game from the forests of the Vast were stirred, including cooked chunks of [[squirrel]], [[boar]], [[porcupine]], and black-masked [[bear]]. This was flavored with [[wildsage]], imparting a taste of buttered [[leek]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|20}} It was often eaten in accompaniment with [[hardbread]] slathered in [[bloodlick]], and washed down with [[beer]].

A similar dish was '''wildsage vegetable stew''', which was served at [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn.
