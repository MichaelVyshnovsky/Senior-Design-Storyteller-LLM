        "Powers": "The ''Bloody Longblade'' was a ''+2 [[Wounding (weapon quality)|wounding]]'' weapon.",
        "History": "The ''Bloody Longblade'' was gifted to Hadrian Colton by his nobleman father as a symbolic gestureâ€”a bastard sword for a bastard son of a serving wench. The sword was left unused for years until Hadrian Colton realized he needed to improve his sword-fighting skill to enhance his procurement career. Sword-wielding guards and their unwilling owners guarded well the many items he was targeting. Despite the ''Bloody Longblade'' being a hurtful and offensive gift, Hadrian learned to wield the deadly blade, making his career long and fruitful.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the ''Bloody Longblade'' found its way to [[Daggerford]] where it was in the stock of [[Stran]], the local black market trader staying at the [[Black Stone Inn]]."
