Many of the sword's owners did not keep it for very long. In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''The Shadow's Blade'', the original or a replica, was wielded by [[Purvis]], an assassin who was hired by the speaker of [[Lonelywood]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the weapon belonged to the assassin named [[Slythe]] who served the infamous [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok Anchev]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Soon after, the sword fell into the hands of another Bhaalspawnâ€”the thief [[Viekang]] in the town of [[Saradush]]."
