        "mainbody": "he furnace wagon was an experimental non-magical self-propelled wagon developed by Nadul DaRoni.\nNaduls device was a coal furnace placed atop a small wagon, which used the mechanical power of hot air for propulsion. The furnaces heated air turned a low-geared fan, which connected to the rear axle and pushed the vehicle along. The wagon could not pull itself up inclines of more than 5 degrees, and required  of coal fuel for eight hours of operation. It could carry a total of  of weight (half of which was the fuel).\nThere was a decent chance of the furnace wagon spontaneously exploding while in operation, though Nadul had only heard of one person dying from it and considered it a negligible risk. For those afraid of fire, he invented the hand wagon.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered the furnace wagon built by Nadul DaRoni, valued at 150 gp."
