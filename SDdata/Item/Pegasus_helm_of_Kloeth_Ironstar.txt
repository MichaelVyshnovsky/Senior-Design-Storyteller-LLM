The pegasus helm of Kloeth Ironstar was an exquisitely crafted winged helmet with summoning magic.
Twice per day, upon utterance of a command word, the wearer of this helm could summon a celestial pegasus to aid them in combat, or as an aerial mount for up to three hours.
The spell summon monster IV was used in the creation of this wondrous helm.
