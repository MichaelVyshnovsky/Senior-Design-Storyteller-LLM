        "mainbody": "'''''Potions of magic dispelling''''' were a rare type of [[potion]] that stripped the imbiber of all magical effects.",
        "Description": "These potions were typically kept in wide-necked [[ceramic]] or [[clay]] stout [[jar]]s. [[Flask]]s were corked with a large stopper. Each contained enough liquid for one full dose.",
        "Usage": "In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some ''potions of magic dispelling'' were in use among hunters and shamans of the [[Black Raven tribe]] that hunted the [[Ice Lakes]] and [[Cold Marshes]] area by the [[Spine of the World]] in [[northwest Faerûn]]. One such potion was claimed by a couple of [[white dragon]]s that nested in the [[River Caves]] where the [[Black Raven River]] spilled onto the surface."
