Umojas Harvester was an enchanted Ubtaoan sickle wielded by druid Umoja in the late 14 century DR.
The Harvester appeared as a quite mundane metallic sickle.
Umojas Harvester possessed several minor enchantments. When it was wielded in battle, it functioned as a +1 magic weapon. Additionally, it imbued its owner with a small amount of health and stamina. Ubtaoan magics made the sickle only usable by only humans, only druids, and only individuals who revered powers of good.
Umoja was a kind and gentle man who preferred to use the Harvester for the cultivation of the jungles lands in a way that did not interfere with natural balance. However, he was a capable fighter, and when pushed into conflict, Umoja used the Harvester to reap lives instead of crops. By the , Umoja carried his Harvester to the city of Samargol, guided by the will of his deity.
