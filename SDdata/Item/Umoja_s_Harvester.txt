'''''Umoja's Harvester''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Ubtaoan]] [[sickle]] wielded by [[druid]] [[Umoja]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Harvester'' appeared as a quite mundane metallic sickle.

==Powers==
''Umoja's Harvester'' possessed several minor enchantments. When it was wielded in battle, it functioned as a ''+1'' magic weapon. Additionally, it imbued its owner with a small amount of health and stamina. Ubtaoan magics made the sickle only usable by only [[human]]s, only druids, and only individuals who revered powers of good.

==History==
Umoja was a kind and gentle man who preferred to use the ''Harvester'' for the cultivation of the jungle's lands in a way that did not interfere with natural balance. However, he was a capable fighter, and when pushed into conflict, Umoja used the ''Harvester'' to reap lives instead of crops. By the {{yearlink|1374}}, Umoja carried his ''Harvester'' to the city of [[Samargol]], guided by the will of his deity.
