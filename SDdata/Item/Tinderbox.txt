A tinderbox was a set of tools to quickly light up a fire. The collection of items was also known as flint and steel or flint and tinder.
Typical tinderboxes were small wood boxes containing flint, one or more pieces of fire steel, and tinder, which usually consisted of a piece of charred cloth soaked in oil as a quick fire starter. Setting a fire ablaze by employing these tools took merely seconds, provided dry fuel was available.
Resistant oak tinderboxes with a large piece of flint, several fire steel bars and tinder were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. The flint and steel could also be sold separately, as well as packs of "instant fire starters" containing only tinder and flint.
