A '''tinderbox''' was a set of tools to quickly light up a [[fire]]. The collection of items was also known as '''flint and steel''' or '''flint and tinder'''.

==Description==
Typical tinderboxes were small wood boxes containing [[flint]], one or more pieces of fire [[steel]], and tinder, which usually consisted of a piece of charred [[cloth]] soaked in [[oil]] as a quick fire starter. Setting a fire ablaze by employing these tools took merely seconds, provided dry fuel was available.<ref name="PHB5e-p150,153"  />

Resistant [[oak]] tinderboxes with a large piece of flint, several fire steel bars and tinder were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. The flint and steel could also be sold separately, as well as packs of "instant fire starters" containing only tinder and flint.

==Notable Tinderboxes==
* ''[[Magic tinderbox]]'', an [[enchanted]] tinderbox that was created by [[Daltim Flamefist]].
