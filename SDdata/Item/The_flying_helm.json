        "mainbody": "'''''The flying helm''''' of [[Ravilar's Cloak]] was a legendary mysterious item or a supernatural phenomenon that was rumored to be manifested by souls of dead warriors of [[Turmish]].\n\n{{quote|''Anything that winds up missing in Ravilar's Cloak is blamed on a flying helmet, a magical helm that haunts the city, picking up loose coins, lost tips for barmaids, daggers, the occasional bag of gold dust, and so on.''|[[Adamar Session]], [[bard]] of [[Starmantle]].}}",
        "Description": "''The flying helm'' of Ravilar's Cloak was indeed a magical flying [[helmet]]. Some believed that it was created by infusing the item with the souls of the dead. It was said that once this ordinary-looking helmet was put on one's head, it became connected to its owner, and its true nature was only revealed after the owner's death.",
        "History": "By the late-14{{th}} century, legends of ''the flying helm'' became one of the most well-known facts about the village of Ravilar's Cloak in Turmish. Some witnessed the floating helmet moving across the town's streets, collecting stray lost [[coin]]s. Locals claimed that the helmet could pick up small items and carry them away to places unknown. When something became lost or misplaced, townies of the Cloak blamed the infamous ''flying helm''.\n\nAt some point before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Adamar Session, Bard of Starmantle, recorded tales of ''the flying helm'' during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Reach."
