A '''''robe of eyes''''' was a wondrous item that allowed its wearer to see invisible creatures, see into the [[Ethereal Plane]] at all times, and to see in every direction.

==Description==
A ''robe of eyes'' appeared like a normal robe adorned with several patterns that resembled eyes.

Variations in the shape of [[jellaba]]s and [[kimono]]s were known in [[Zakhara]]{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate|73}} and [[Kara-Tur]], respectively.

==Powers==
Besides becoming able to see in all directions, the wearer of a ''robe of eyes'' became magically competent at visual searches. Additionally, the wearer gained [[darkvision]] and the ability to not lose eysight even when averting eyes from an enemy.

However, the ''robe'' was sensitive to strong magical light. If a ''[[light]]'', ''[[continual flame]]'', or ''[[daylight]]'' [[spell]] were cast on the robe, its wearer risked becoming temporarily blind.

When worn in the [[Nine Hells]], most of the ''robe's'' powers remained intact, though its ability to aid in tracking would be nullified.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|43}}

On occasion, these robes were created in two variations, ''lesser robes of eyes'' and ''greater robes of eyes''. The greater variation not only granted the wearer ''true seeing'' but also improved their chances of spotting objects, danger, traps, etc., as well as their investigation skills. The lesser robes came with nine charges of the ''true seeing'' spell, on average, usable once per day.
