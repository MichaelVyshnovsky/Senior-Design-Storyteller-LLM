'''Tremair''', also known as '''hexagonite''' or '''pink tremolite''', was a very small but valuable [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]].

==Description==
In raw ore, tremair was found as small, pink, clear to translucent crystals. These could be cut into even smaller faceted gems. In [[Waterdeep]], [[Chessenta]], and [[Sembia]], these small gemstones were sewn or woven into gowns that debutantes wore at social occasions, signifying eligibility for marriage.

==Powers==
If worn next to the skin, tremair gems bestowed an immunity to magical curses on the wearer.
