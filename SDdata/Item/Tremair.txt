Tremair, also known as hexagonite or pink tremolite, was a very small but valuable fancy stone.
In raw ore, tremair was found as small, pink, clear to translucent crystals. These could be cut into even smaller faceted gems. In Waterdeep, Chessenta, and Sembia, these small gemstones were sewn or woven into gowns that debutantes wore at social occasions, signifying eligibility for marriage.
If worn next to the skin, tremair gems bestowed an immunity to magical curses on the wearer.
