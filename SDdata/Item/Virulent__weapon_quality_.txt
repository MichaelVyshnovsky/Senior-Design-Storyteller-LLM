The '''''virulent''''' [[weapon quality]] was one that hastened the speed at which [[poison]] delivered by the weapon affected the victim.

==Description==
A ''virulent'' weapon was always a [[light weapon]]. Its surface was not even but dotted with oozing pits.

==Powers==
A ''virulent'' quality did not affect any of the weapon's other qualities, like sharpness. Instead, it affected contact or injury poison coated on it. Poisons on the weapon became harder to resist. Apart from that, poisons usually caused initial and secondary reactions from the body it was delivered into. The ''virulent'' quality doubled the speed at which a poison's secondary reaction affected the target's body.

As mentioned above, a ''virulent'' weapon seeped a fluid from the pits that dotted its surface. This fluid was also a poison that hurt those that were hit by the weapon.

Creating such a weapon required a ''[[poison]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
The ''virulent'' quality was a weapon quality associated with the [[drow]]. Most such weapons had imagery of spiders, spider webs, or [[demon]]s.
