An '''''eye of the druuthbane''''' was a [[magical item]] designed to expose and thwart a [[druuth]]â€”a band of [[doppelganger]]s in the service of a [[mind flayer]].

==Description==
It was a yellow [[crystal]] about as big as a [[human]] fist. It weighed {{SI|3|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
An ''eye of the druuthbane'' had a variety of powers dedicating to foiling the powers of doppelgangers and illithids. First, if a doppelganger was within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, it glowed red; if an illithid was within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, it glowed blue; and if both were {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, it glowed violet.

Second, when grasped in one's hand, it bolstered the bearer's mental defenses and force of will.

Third, it could be used once a day to fire a red beam at a creature that, if it was a doppelganger, would be forced to return to its true form for up to half a minute if it couldn't resist.

==History==
The first ''eye of the druuthbane'' was fashioned by a [[wizard]] who battled a powerful druuth.

After that time, it was copied and spread far and wide to oppose other druuth.

==Creation==
Creating an ''eye of the druuthbane'' required the spells ''[[resistance]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', and ''[[polymorph other]]''. One was valued at 18,000 [[gp]].
