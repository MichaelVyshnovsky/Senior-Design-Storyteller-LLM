Flaming burst was a weapon enchantment that caused flames to sheathe a weapon and explode against a target.
In addition to serving as a flaming weapon, a critical strike against a foe triggered an explosion of fire against them. It would do this even if the flames were not sheathing the blade.
The flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition fired from them.
The creator must use flame blade, flame strike, or fireball to add the flaming property.
It could not be used to enhance weapons formed from dlarun as it was inherently resistant to fire.
Some veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as flaming burst weapons. 
Experienced zealots of the Order of the Black Flame could imbue their weapons with properties for up to a minute at a time.
Helmed horrors could enhance their blades with several magical qualities, including flaming burst.
