        "mainbody": "Hearts of the beast were a type of enchanted food created by the clerics of Malar.\nThese items were created using the hearts of predatory beasts. Once extracted, the hearts were smoked and cured using Malarite divine magics.\nIn order to activate its enchantment, a heart of the beast had to be consumed completely. The eater was granted a boon of Malars divine magic similar to the divine power spell.\nEven though hearts of the beast were items created by Malarite clergy, by the late 14 century DR, they could be seen in the hands of individuals not associated with the Cult of Malar."
