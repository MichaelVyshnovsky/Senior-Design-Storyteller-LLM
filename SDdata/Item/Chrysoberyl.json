        "Description": "Chrysoberyl was a hard stone that wore well, so it was usually facet-cut into transparent yellow-green to pale green jewels. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "This gem was used in enchanting devices that provided protection against ''[[magic jar]]'' spells or other forms of (usually [[necromantic]]) possession.\n\nUsing rare enchantments, chrysoberyl chips or whole stones could be melted into the metal when forging a weapon, allowing the implement to strike [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] and [[Gaseous form|gaseous]] creatures, such as [[ghost]]s and [[phase spider]]s.\n\nPowdered chrysoberyl mixed with the liquid extracted from a particular crushed flower formed a paste that could be applied externally on the body to stop the spread of [[mummy rot]] and all molds and fungus.\n\nA chrysoberyl gem could be used for short-range but very detailed [[scrying]]. For that reason, it was known as a ''cat's eye''.\n\nChrysoberyl was one of the \"nine secrets\"&mdash;stones that could be enchanted to become [[ioun stones]].\n\nIn ancient [[Netheril]], these gems were sometimes used by the [[sorcerer]]-kings as message stones that would speak a recorded voice when touched. Message stones that survived the ages were highly prized whether the message was an intimate note to a lover, an inspirational quote, instructions for a magical procedure, or directions to a treasure trove that may or may not have been discovered.\n\nChrysoberyl stones were believed to have ties to [[Outer Planes]] that explained their magical properties especially against the [[undead]] and [[demon]]ic possession."
