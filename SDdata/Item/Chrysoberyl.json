        "mainbody": "hrysoberyl was a fancy stone found in the Realms. \nChrysoberyl was a hard stone that wore well, so it was usually facet-cut into transparent yellow-green to pale green jewels. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.\nThis gem was used in enchanting devices that provided protection against magic jar spells or other forms of (usually necromantic) possession.\nUsing rare enchantments, chrysoberyl chips or whole stones could be melted into the metal when forging a weapon, allowing the implement to strike ethereal and gaseous creatures, such as ghosts and phase spiders.\nPowdered chrysoberyl mixed with the liquid extracted from a particular crushed flower formed a paste that could be applied externally on the body to stop the spread of mummy rot and all molds and fungus.\nA chrysoberyl gem could be used for short-range but very detailed scrying. For that reason, it was known as a cats eye.\nChrysoberyl was one of the \"nine secrets\"&mdashstones that could be enchanted to become ioun stones.\nIn ancient Netheril, these gems were sometimes used by the sorcerer-kings as message stones that would speak a recorded voice when touched. Message stones that survived the ages were highly prized whether the message was an intimate note to a lover, an inspirational quote, instructions for a magical procedure, or directions to a treasure trove that may or may not have been discovered.\nChrysoberyl stones were believed to have ties to Outer Planes that explained their magical properties especially against the undead and demonic possession."
