        "mainbody": "The Elemental Scourge was a massive magical apparatus that could grant an individual the power to summon a dozen elder elementals.\nthumb|340px|A map of the House of Kossuth with the Elemental Scourge dominating the circular chamber to the north.The Elemental Scourge was an enormous,  high device that dominated the northern half of a  wide cylindrical chamber within the underground Kossuths House in Skelem. This chamber was decorated with intimidating frescoes of giant elementals wrecking havoc, and contained four statues, each depicting a huge elemental&mdashone each of air, earth, fire, and water&mdashrepresenting the creatures that the device would enable a user to conjure.\nThe device itself had many spindly arms ending in blades, globes, or metal hands, all of which were constantly in motion, animated by the elemental energies that the device tapped into. As they moved, the arms seemed to reach out or perform strange maneuvers. The whole apparatus emitted otherworldly dim lights and muffled noises.\nAt the base of the apparatus were a pair of concentric circles carved into the stone floor with runes etched into the space between them. The device was activated when an individual knelt inside these circles.\nOnce activated, the Elemental Scourge unloaded elemental power into the user kneeling in the circles. This power could overwhelm and injure a weaker individual, and thus the device would not activate if a user lacked power or experience. Once a user had received this power, they gained the one-time ability to summon a dozen  tall elementals&mdashthree from each of the four primary Elemental planes&mdashto any location they had visited within  of the device. For one minute, this monstrous force would obey the users every command. This ability did not have to be used immediately, and the user retained the power for one year, during which time they emitted a strong aura of conjuration magic.\nAfter bestowing this conjuration ability, the Elemental Scourge had to recharge for one year before it could be activated again.\nThe apparatus was created as part of a nearly unprecedented collaboration between powerful Netherese wizards and the church of Kossuth.\nAfter Skelem was overwhelmed and fell into ruin sometime after the Fall of Netheril, details of the device were forgotten, however rumors and legends persisted of a weapon capable of summoning an army residing somewhere in the citys ruins. In the , these rumors drew the attention of a pair of fire giant brothers, Soluf and Gharod, who sent a team of yuan-ti and giantkin to seek out the legendary weapon. The giants hoped to use the Elemental Scourge to raze Mulmaster and conquer the eastern Moonsea, however their minions struggled to find it in the ruins."
