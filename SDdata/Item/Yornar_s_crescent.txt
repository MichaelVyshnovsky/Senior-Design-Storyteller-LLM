Yornars crescent was a magic item associated with the church of Mielikki.
It was just a simple piece of worked leather, weighing , with a very aged and weathered appearance.
With the appropriate command word, the holder of the crescent could detect poison or produce a light as often as they needed. In addition, they could enchanted natural weapons and transport through trees once a day each.
It was of course named for the legendary ranger of Mielikki known as Yornar the Tracker, who was the first bearer and namesake of a holy Mielikkian spellbookâ€”Yornars Trail Companion. Like that book, the crescent changed hands between Mielikkians many times. Moreover, many versions of it were made.
Together with skill at item enchantment, one needed the spells detect poison, faerie fire, greater magic fang, and tree stride.
