'''''Yornar's crescent''''' was a [[magic item]] associated with the [[church of Mielikki]].

==Description==
It was just a simple piece of worked leather, weighing {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}, with a very aged and weathered appearance.

==Powers==
With the appropriate [[command word]], the holder of the ''crescent'' could detect poison or produce a light as often as they needed. In addition, they could enchanted natural weapons and transport through [[tree]]s once a day each.

==History==
It was of course named for the legendary [[ranger]] of [[Mielikki]] known as [[Yornar|Yornar the Tracker]], who was the first bearer and namesake of a holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]]â€”''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''. Like that book, the ''crescent'' changed hands between Mielikkians many times. Moreover, many versions of it were made.

==Creation==
Together with skill at [[item enchantment]], one needed the spells ''[[detect poison]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[greater magic fang]]'', and ''[[tree stride]]''.
