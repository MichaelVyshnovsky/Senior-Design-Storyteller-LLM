'''''Returning pikes''''' were [[enchanted]] throwing [[polearm]]s, found in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Returning pikes'' were imbued with the [[returning]] [[dwarf|dwarvish]] [[enchantment]] of [[Clan Ticklebeard]] that pulled the [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] out and ruched it back to the thrower's hands. Additionally, they possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that guided the weapon toward its target and increased its damage, making it magical.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''returning pikes'' were known for the ''Crazy Wilbur'' battle technique invented by the Ticklebeards. Pikes and other returning weapons were swallowed by the enemies and then called back, making a gory mess in the process. One such magic pike was in the hands of [[Grat]] the Trader, a [[goblin]] of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The weapon itself was looted from nearby locales targeted by the cult in 1492 DR.
