Returning pikes were enchanted throwing polearms, found in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR.
Returning pikes were imbued with the returning dwarvish enchantment of Clan Ticklebeard that pulled the pike out and ruched it back to the throwers hands. Additionally, they possessed a +1 enchantment that guided the weapon toward its target and increased its damage, making it magical.
In the , returning pikes were known for the Crazy Wilbur battle technique invented by the Ticklebeards. Pikes and other returning weapons were swallowed by the enemies and then called back, making a gory mess in the process. One such magic pike was in the hands of Grat the Trader, a goblin of the Cult of the Absolute. The weapon itself was looted from nearby locales targeted by the cult in 1492 DR.
