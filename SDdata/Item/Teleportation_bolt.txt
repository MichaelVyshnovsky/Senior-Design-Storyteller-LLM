'''''Teleportation bolts''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] ammunition created by an adventurer named [[Visgove]].

==Powers==
These enchanted [[bolt]]s were not designed to deal damage to the target, instead, upon a successful impact, they ''[[teleport]]ed'' the target towards the shooter via magic.

==History==
Visgove was an adventurer renowned for his spectacular laziness. No one was surprised when the man sank a significant amount of [[coin]] into developing these magic bolts sometime before [[1372 DR]]. Why would Visgove run across a battlefield when it was much easier to transport an enemy directly into the range of his [[battle axe]].

Even though expensive, by [[1373 DR]], ''teleportation bolts'' were in use in [[Zhentil Keep]] of the [[Moonsea]] region.
