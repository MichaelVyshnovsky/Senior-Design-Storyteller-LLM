        "mainbody": "'''''Daisy''''' was the unique [[enchanted]] light [[crossbow]] that belonged to [[Vicalet Hawkeye]] the mage-killer sometime before [[1281 DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Daisy'' possessed a potent ''+3'' enchantment, and it made it significantly easier for the missiles shot out of the crossbow to reach their targets.",
        "History": "A renowned [[half-elven]] mercenary, Vicalet Hawkeye, named this enchanted crossbow for its ability to make its targets to \"push up [[daisy|daisies]].\" Famous for his impeccable aim that killed quite a few [[wizard]]s, Vicalet made a living by selling his services to various adventuring groups. ''Daisy'' was always at his side, sniping all spell-casters that Vicalet's employees might've missed. The mercenary's weapon always found its target when crafty wizards tried to protect themselves with the ''[[project image]]'' spell.\n\nVicalet Hawkeye retired a wealthy man and spent his later years working on his vineyard. ''Daisy'' was sold to an inexperienced and cocky [[human]] mercenary, but the ownership was short-lived, just like the mercenary himself. Over time this weapon changed hands until ending up in possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]] in 1281 DR."
