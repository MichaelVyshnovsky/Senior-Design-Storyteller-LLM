An unnamed '''archaic device''' was a [[rune arm]] kept at the [[Temple of Mystra (King's Forest)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[King's Forest]].<ref name=DDO-MotU">

==Description==
The archaic device was made out of some kind of [[gemstone]].<ref name=DDO-MotU" />

==Powers==
By absorbing some incoming elemental damage, the archaic device could convert that energy into blasts of force. This energy additionally energized the wielder's other weapons, allowing them to deal extra force-based damage.<ref name=DDO-MotU" />

Wielding the archaic device also boosted the effectiveness of casting [[spell]]s and deflecting attacks.<ref name=DDO-MotU" />

==History==
The archaic device was stored alongside an [[ancient gemstone]] at the Temple of Mystra at some point before the deity's death and the [[Spellplague]] of the {{yearlinkName|1385}}. The temple quickly became abandoned.<ref name=DDO-MotU" />

In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, after [[Ana Brabener]] was rescued by [[adventurer]]s from the slavers [[Eldrin Szind]], [[Odezzt Avithoul]] and [[Phargred Avithoul]], the archaic device was taken from the temple.<ref name=DDO-MotU" />
