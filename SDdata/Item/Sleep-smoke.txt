Sleep-smoke was a dark-gray, smoky gas that caused those who inhaled it to fall unconscious for up to 4 minutes. When released into the air, it quickly dissipated, and affected an area 20 feet (6 m) in diameter.
It was known to be used primarily by members of Xanathar Thieves Guild, specifically when they attempted to capture or kidnap a target.
