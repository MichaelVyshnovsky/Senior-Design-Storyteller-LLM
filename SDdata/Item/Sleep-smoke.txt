'''Sleep-smoke''' was a dark-gray, smoky gas that caused those who inhaled it to fall unconscious for up to 4 minutes. When released into the air, it quickly dissipated, and affected an area 20 feet (6 m) in diameter.

It was known to be used primarily by members of [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]], specifically when they attempted to capture or kidnap a target.
