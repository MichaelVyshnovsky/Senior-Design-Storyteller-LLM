The '''''Abyss Beckoners''''' was a set of very rare [[enchanted]] [[gloves]] imbued with chaotic magic that affected [[summon]]ed creatures around them.
{{quote|''Demons will bite their masters, slaves, comrades, and, on occasion, themselves. They bite on principle, and are functionally [[piranha]] with extra steps.''}}

==Powers==
When the ''Abyss Beckoners'' were worn by a [[mage]], they projected a ''demonspirit aura''. This magical bubble affected all summoned creatures caught within. They were toughened, becoming resistant to all mundane and elemental damage except [[psychic]]; however, the same creatures were also extremely susceptible to temporary madness and aggression towards everyone around them.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Abyss Beckoners'' were stashed away in a vault, under lock and key within the hidden [[Zhentarim]] hideout underneath [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn on the [[Risen Road]].
