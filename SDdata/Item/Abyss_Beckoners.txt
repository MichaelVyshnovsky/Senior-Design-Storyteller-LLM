The Abyss Beckoners was a set of very rare enchanted gloves imbued with chaotic magic that affected summoned creatures around them.
When the Abyss Beckoners were worn by a mage, they projected a demonspirit aura. This magical bubble affected all summoned creatures caught within. They were toughened, becoming resistant to all mundane and elemental damage except psychic however, the same creatures were also extremely susceptible to temporary madness and aggression towards everyone around them.
In the , the Abyss Beckoners were stashed away in a vault, under lock and key within the hidden Zhentarim hideout underneath Waukeens Rest inn on the Risen Road.
