        "mainbody": "Ward tokens were small objects with magical properties used to bypass magical wards and traps and gain access to secure areas.\nWard tokens usually had a single rune or symbol inscribed into them.\nDurlag Trollkiller created various ward tokens as a means of navigating his dangerous, trap-filled home, Durlags Tower. Due to the adventuring popularity of the tower, many fake ward tokens were created by merchants to sell to adventurers. A few of the original ward tokens were in circulation, but they were indistinguishable from the genuine ones."
