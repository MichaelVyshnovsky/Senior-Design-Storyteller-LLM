'''''Artificial leech''''' was a surgical tool occasionally used as a weapon, that possessed a minor [[enchantment]].

==Powers==
''Artificial leeches'' bore a simple enchantment, similar to that of a ''+1'' weapon that made it more deadly and easier to aim with. The device itself was used for bloodletting. It had mechanism that activated with a twist, sending the leech's needles spinning.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], several of the ''artificial leeches'' could be found in the [[House of Healing]] in [[Reithwin]] and in the hands of [[undead]] nurse [[Sister Geanne]] who served depraved [[Sharran]] surgeon [[Malus Thorm]]. Another such bloodletting tool belonged to the [[drow]] blood magic researcher [[Araj Oblodra]] who ran [[Crimson Draughts]] apothecary in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
