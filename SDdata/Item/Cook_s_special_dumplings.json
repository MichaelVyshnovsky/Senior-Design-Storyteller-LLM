        "mainbody": "ooks special dumplings were a culinary creation of Geldorf \"The Cook\" Tinbasher, a stern dwarven chef from Thay, active in the 14 century DR.\nCooks special dumplings were hand-shaped savory little morsels that exuded mouth-watering scent making it hard not to devour the entire batch. These dumplings also had more practical use, especially helpful for gladiators of Thay. When consumed before battle, each dumpling invigorated the eater, giving them an upper hand when striking their opponents.\nAnother reason not to eat an entire batch at the time - severe indigestion.\nIn 1369 DR, Geldorf Tinbasher offered the Champion of Baeloths Pit freshly made special dumplings in exchange for a piece of the Concocter, a myconid potion maker, during the Champions stay within the gladiatorial pits of Thay."
