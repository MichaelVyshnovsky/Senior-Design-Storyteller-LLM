A '''''monster slayer glaive''''' was an [[enchanted]] weapon used by professional monster hunters to keep the ugly parts of the job at the other end of the [[polearm]].

==Powers==
This [[glaive]] possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the hands of the wielder towards the target and boosted the weapon's damage. Its ''monster slayer'' enchantment made the weapons effective against [[monstrosities]], always landing more severe wounds than to any other type of creature. Additionally, a ''monster slayer glaive'' improved the wielder's jumping strength and distance, extending it by {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}}.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such glaive belonged to [[Roah Moonglow]], a [[hin]] agent of the [[Zhentarim]] who did business with the recently emerged [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]].
