Myconid pie was an aptly-named variety of Duergar pie made, presumably, using the flesh of myconids.
As of the late 15 century DR, expensive  servings of myconid pie were sold by Gorstaf, a rude duergar baker from the city of Gracklstugh in the Underdark in northwest Faer√ªn. Gorstaf claimed that myconid pies were for those willing to "take their health in their own hands."
