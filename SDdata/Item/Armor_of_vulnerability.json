        "mainbody": "edition Dungeon Masters Guide was instead listed with a \"Rare\" rarity.\nArmor of vulnerability, was a type of cursed plate armor that posed more harm to threats than protection, often created with the intent of tricking ones foes into wearing them.\nIn the ages prior to the Spellplague, this armor gave of the impression of carrying a +1, +2, or +3 enchantment. In actuality, sets of this armor carried either a -2, -3, or -4 enchantment. And the armor was liable to completely fall apart if struck was a devastatingly powerful blow.\nIn the years following the Spellplague, the enchantments upon these armors changed. These did indeed carry protective enchantments, but these would vanish and inverse as soon as a wearer was severely injured, instead giving a -2.\nFollowing the Second Sundering, the effects of this armor were in fluctuation once more. Initially, sets of the armor would give off the impression of having a +2 enchantment, but really carrying a -2. And once more, the armor would completely fall apart if ever struck critically. Eventually the effect changed for a final time. Now each set of armor offered greater protection to either bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing type harm. However, they offered protection to only one of these categories, making their wearer more vulnerable to attacks of the other two varieties. However, the curse of the armor would only activate once the wearer was attuned to it."
