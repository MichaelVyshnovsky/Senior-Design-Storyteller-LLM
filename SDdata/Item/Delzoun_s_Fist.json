        "Powers": "Whoever wielded the hammer was imbued with strength comparable to that given by a ''[[belt of giant strength|girdle of hill giant strength]]''. It was also capable of protecting its wielder from spells cast at them, similar to the effect of a ''[[ring of spell turning]]''.\n\nWithin one to three weeks of owning the hammer, two minor and one major malevolent effects would begin to manifest for the wielder. The major effect would only begin to occur after the first instance of it being used against a being that wasn't any form of of [[evil]] [[alignment]].",
        "History": "Delzoun's Fist was created by the dwarf of the same name, the founder of the kingdom [[Delzoun]]. He was said to have wielded the hammer until the day he died."
