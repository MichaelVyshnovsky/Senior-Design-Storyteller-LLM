'''Sardonyx''' was a variety of banded [[onyx]].

==Description== 
Sardonyx was characterized by alternating stripes of [[carnelian]] (also known as [[wikipedia:en:sard|sard]]) and white onyx. These [[semi-precious stones]] were usually cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] to show off the banded pattern but were also used in cameo work. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
Sardonyx had many uses in the magical Art. It was used as a spell component and in creating magic items which affected wisdom. It was reported to have the same properties as the much rarer [[king's tears]] except that it was not indestructible. And it was one of the "nine secrets" (gemstones that could become ''[[ioun stones]]'' if enchanted properly). Wearing or carrying sardonyx could also absorb a minimal amount of damage from a ''[[magic missile]]'', but this was a random occurrence and thus not very reliable.
