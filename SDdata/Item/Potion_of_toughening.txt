'''''Potions of toughening''''' were [[potion]]s that possessed ''[[heal|healing]]'' and fortifying effects, common in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Powers==
When consumed, a ''potion of toughening'' temporarily increased the imbiber's fortitude, health, and patched bodily harm suffered. Unlike regular ''[[potion of healing]]'', this concoction's effects dispersed after 70 to 120 minutes. If the imbiber suffered significant damage before consuming the potion and not healed by the time the magic expired, the imbiber returned to the vulnerable state or even became unconscious. If the drinker was knocked out after the ''potion of toughening'' expired, they continued to suffer damage and could eventually perish if not healed in time.

Another danger of consuming a ''potion of toughening'' came from drinking at the second portion before the effect of the first one expired. The second dose had no restorative effect whatsoever but caused the drinker to suffer from a system shock and possibly die from it immediately.

==History==
In 1370 DR, ''potions of toughening'' were popular among the daring [[Undermountain]] delvers and could be found among loot taken from unfortunate deceased adventurers by the inhabitants of the infamous Waterdeep dungeon.
