'''''Tridents of thunder''''' were enchanted [[trident]]s wielded by the [[marel]] raid leaders in the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].

==Powers==
Apart from a ''+3'' enchantment, ''tridents of thunder'' dealt deafening sonic thunderclap damage upon a successful strike.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], marel King [[Uhlmor]] regularly sent squads of raiders to plunder passing ships. One such raid targeted the ''[[Grim Voyager]]'', [[Kettia Freeborn]]'s ship that transported the companions of the [[Hero of Daggerford]]. In the ensued battle, the marel raiders were thwarted, and their leader's ''trident of thunder'' was the heroes' reward.
