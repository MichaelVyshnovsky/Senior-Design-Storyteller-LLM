The '''''Mantle of Hell's Furnace''''' was a brightly colored [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] imbued with raw magics of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Powers==
The ''Mantle'' was a bright red cloth woven out of the flaming beard hair of countless [[azer]]s. [[Sage]]s believed that when the ''Mantle of Hell's Furnace'' exhausted its magics, it would disappear from the [[Prime Material plane]] and be pulled back to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

The [[enchantment]]s weaved into the fabric of the cloak were powerful and allowed the wearer to cast ''[[Aganazzar's scorcher]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', and ''[[charm fire elemental kin]]''.

==History==
The first known owner of this cloak was [[Ullabem]], the High Priest of [[Kossuth]]. He harnessed the cloak's magic for fifteen years until his death at the hands of a [[cleric]] of [[Istishia]]. The priestess was repulsed by the Kossuthan magic and attempted to destroy the ''Mantle''. Fortunately, Ullabem's [[efreeti]] allies slew the cleric before the cloak could be lost forever. The next owner of the ''Mantle of Hell's Furnace'' was one of the efreeti who lost it to a cunning [[rogue]] who summoned the efreeti from a magical  block of [[sandalwood]].

Some time later, by the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the ''Mantle of Hell's Furnace'' ended up in possession of [[Orrick|Orrick the Gray]], who researched magical ''[[mythal]]s'' in his tower just on the edge of [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]].
