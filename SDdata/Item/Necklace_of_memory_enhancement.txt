A '''''necklace of memory enhancement''''' was a magical [[amulet]] that greatly improved the wearer's powers of recall.

==Description==
It was fashioned from [[brass]].

==Powers==
The wearer became immune to all forms of memory loss, whether due to magical or natural causes, like a ''[[forget]]'' spell. Furthermore, they gained an eidetic memory, being able to perfectly recall any event witnessed, any conversation heard, or any book read up to seven days previously, though beyond this time their memory was as normal. Moreover, they had to have been wearing the ''necklace of memory enhancement'' at the time.

It had no impact on how a [[wizard]] memorized [[spell]]s or forgot them after casting.

==Notable Owners==
[[Adzerak]], a [[lich]] and bibliophile devotee of [[Deneir]], kept a ''necklace of memory enhancement'' on a hook in his nightstand in his lair in [[Cormyr]] around [[1367 DR]].

The curators of the Hall of Maps at the [[House of the Moon]] in [[Waterdeep]], already possessing excellent memories, shared a ''necklace of memory enhancement'' to find specific [[map]]s in the unlabeled [[scrollcase|scroll tubes]].

An unidentified woman in [[Ravens Bluff]] wore a ''necklace of memory enhancement'', which was a family heirloom, in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. She may have given it as a reward to an [[adventurer]] who saved her 5-year-old daughter from drowning.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|12}}
