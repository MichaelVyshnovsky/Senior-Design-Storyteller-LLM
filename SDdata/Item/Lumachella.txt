Lumachella, also known as fire marble, was a hardstone found in the Realms.
Lumachella was a rare type of dark brown marble that contained tiny fossilized snails with iridescent shells. A typical price for large quantities of this hardstone was 26 sp per pound (0.45kg).
Lumachella powder was a substitute material component for the airy water and water breathing spells. It could also be used in the ink mixture for making scrolls of both spells.
