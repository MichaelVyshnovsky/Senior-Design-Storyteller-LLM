'''''Scarabs of death''''' were deadly [[enchanted]] items that appeared harmless at first glance.

==Description==
''Scarabs of death'' appeared indistinguishable from mundane or magical [[amulet]]s, brooches, or scarabs.

==Powers==
If a ''scarab of death'' was touching warm living flesh, placed in a bag or a similar container, worn on clothes, or simply kept within {{SI|1'|'"|long=yes}} from a warm living creature for between 1 and 10 minutes, the item's enchantment became obvious. 
A ''scarab of death'' transformed into a deadly flesh-burrowing insect that chewed and tore through the target's [[leather armor]], clothes, and body moving towards the heart. It took 1 to 10 minutes for the monster to reach the target's heart and kill them. After the target's death, a ''scarab of death'' transformed back into its inert form.

''Scarabs of death'' could be safely kept in containers made of thick [[wood]], [[ceramic]], [[ivory]], or metal.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|151|Mazrikoth's Scarab of Death}}

==Creation==
''Scarabs of death'' could be created by experienced magic item crafters with the use of the ''[[slay living]]'' [[spell]].

==Notable Owners==
[[Aragath]], a [[lich]] priest of [[Talos]] who laired underneath [[Jathrin's Jump]] guarded his underground temple with six [[golem]]s. Each was outfitted with numerous magic items, including ''scarabs of death''.
