        "mainbody": "yeomans fiddle was a mechanical musical instrument invented by the gnome artist Nadul DaRoni. It was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nThe instrument had either a crank or a spring that turned a rosin-covered wheel against the strings to produce sound, while a set of keys connected to gears pressed the strings. It could include different wheels for different songs.\nWhen played, a yeomans fiddle attracted much attention, but due to its complex nature and delicate construction it also had a small chance of malfunctioning."
