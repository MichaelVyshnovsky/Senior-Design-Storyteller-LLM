        "mainbody": "A '''yeoman's fiddle''' was a mechanical musical instrument invented by the [[gnome]] artist [[Nadul DaRoni]]. It was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
        "Description": "The instrument had either a crank or a spring that turned a rosin-covered wheel against the strings to produce sound, while a set of keys connected to gears pressed the strings. It could include different wheels for different songs.\n\nWhen played, a yeoman's fiddle attracted much attention, but due to its complex nature and delicate construction it also had a small chance of malfunctioning."
