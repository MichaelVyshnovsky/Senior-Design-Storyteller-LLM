The ring of nagas kiss was the ring magically-created using naga blood in 1369 DR.
The ring of nagas kiss was a metal circle decorated with a serpentine design that was reminiscent of naga scales.
The ring of nagas kiss was created to be wielded by a fighter and granted the wearer significantly increased protection and improved constitution.
In 1369 DR, the heroes from Phlan seeking to gain entrance to Castle Cormanthor via Dwarven Dungeons found one of many magical fountains corrupted by the evil influence in the ruins. The Fountain Macabre asked vials of naga blood when poured, the blood congealed, and formed into the serpentine ring of nagas kiss.
