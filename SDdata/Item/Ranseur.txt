A '''ranseur''' ({{Pronounce|r√¶n|SOOR|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) were specialized [[spear]]s in the [[pole arm]] family.

==Description==
Ranseurs had long, tapered tips with two wing-like projections at their base. These secondary barbs projected out at about 45&deg; from the center line, but were curved backward. The base of their heads were often indented, forming a trap between the head and secondary tines. Their shafts were typically {{SIrange|8|10|ft|long=yes}} long.

==Weaponology==
Due to their length, ranseurs had be wielded two-handed by [[human]]-sized creatures. Ranseurs, like most pole arms, were very effective in large numbers, in combination with other types of forces, and when wielded by well-trained troops. For these reasons it was often considered a martial weapon.
