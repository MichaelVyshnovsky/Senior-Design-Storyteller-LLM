        "mainbody": "The '''''Riqq of the Efreet''''' was an unbreakable magical musical instrument created by [[efreet]] craftsmen for the high chieftain of the [[jann of the High Desert]] on his ascension day.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}\n\nSince each new [[jann]] chieftain received a full set of magical instruments known collectively as the [[instruments of the jann]], there were multiple ''riqqs of the efreet'' scattered throughout [[Zakhara]].",
        "Description": "The cymbals of this ''[[riqq]]'', or tambourine, were created from the crushed coins collected from the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] of [[Nog]] and [[Kadar]]. The surface was wrapped tightly with the fine hide of a white [[camel]]. The steel used to create the body of the ''riqq'' was forged deep within a volcano, producing a crimson colored metal. The ''riqq of the efreet'' was painted with runes of power found within the head.",
        "Powers": "Anyone holding the ''riqq'' who flashed the runes at someone watching effectively cast the ''[[hold person]]'' spell upon them. This power could be used once per day, but [[bard]]s and ''[[rawunin]]'' could perform this act twice per day.\n\nBards and ''rawunin'' could also \"fan the flames\" with the ''riqq'', summoning a strong [[fire elemental]] under their control. This power could only be used once per week. The elemental remained under their control so long as the ''riqq'' was played and not interrupted, but would return to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] as soon as this happened. To use this ability the player needed to be near a large fire."
