        "mainbody": "The gauntlet of valor was a highly valuable enchanted gauntlet, one of the Power Arms created by elven archmages of Myth Drannor.\nThe gauntlet of valor was polished to shine in the sun, possibly by magical means, keeping it forever unsoiled and untattered. This gauntlet was one of the pinnacles of elvish craftsmanship and enchantment.\nGauntlet of valor granted their wearers complete immunity to magics such as charm, domination, entanglement, hold, paralysis, sleep, and web. Additionally, gauntlet of valor could be used as an enchanted +2 melee weapon three times a day. Each landed punch had a chance of landing devastating crushing damage to the target, rendering them stunned for several seconds.\nPower Arms were created in the days of pre-Weeping War Myth Drannor. These enchanted gauntlets were crafted to be used by the City of Songs champions, defending their home in times of dire need. By 1281 DR, only three of these Arm were known to exist. The gauntlet of valor, on of the three surviving Arms was in possession of a blind dwarf smith who inhabited the icy depths of Gloomfrost in Icewind Dale circa 1281 DR."
