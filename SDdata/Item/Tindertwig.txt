A tindertwig was an alchemical tool used to easily light fires.
It was a tiny wooden stick with an alchemical substance applied to one end.
When the alchemical substance was struck against something rough, it ignited automatically, much quicker than a flint and steel, let alone with a magnifying glass, and without additional tinder. They made lighting torches and other fires easier and faster.
Related to alchemists fire and smokesticks, tindertwigs required skill in alchemy and spellcasting to make.
Tindertwigs were worth 1 gp each. They were sold among various adventuring supplies, such as by Undermountain merchant Malvar around 1375 DR.
Cogol and Harrik, two ranger followers of Malar circa 1372 DR, tied tindertwigs to their smokesticks for ready ignition.
Five tindertwigs were also part of the equipment of a Zhentarim acolyte of Bane that same year.
Gyudd of Gyudds Distillery in Skullport kept ten of them as part of his equipment in 1375 DR.
Five tindertwigs and a vial of alchemists fire were found behind some deathsbreath mushrooms in Hekkut the Molteds bandit base in the Delimbiyr Vale in 1372 its unknown why they were there. 
A hundred tindertwigs were part of a cargo of supplies sent from Waterdeep to Swordhold in 1372 DR.
