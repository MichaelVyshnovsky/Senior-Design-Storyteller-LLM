        "mainbody": "'''''Shields of the Dragonslayer''''' were [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]]s designed to be used against [[dragons]] and their creation dated back to the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Their massive shields were forged out of immensely strong materials and with the use of cable-building techniques. Some said that the designers of the ''Shields of the Dragonslayer'' were castle engineers. This rumor might as well be true as the ''Shields of the Dragonslayer'' resembled more castle gates rather than traditional shields.",
        "Powers": "These tower shields possessed ''+3'' defensive enchantments and provided a powerful ''+5'' protective magics against [[dragon]]s.",
        "History": "Like many other weapons and armor designed to slay dragonkind, ''Shields of the Dragonslayer'' were traced back to the {{YearlinkName|1018}}. With time, these shields were lost in battle, some were stolen or sold, and by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were found in many places across the [[Sword Coast North]], like in the city of [[Neverwinter]], [[Beorunna's Well]] and the merchants of the [[Crossroad Keep]]."
