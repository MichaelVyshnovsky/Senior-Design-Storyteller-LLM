The '''''Spirit of the Predator''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] from [[Chult]], crafted by [[Intulik]] of the Blood, the one-time subjugator of the [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] peoples.

==Powers==
The ''Spirit of the Predator'' was created via fusing the spirits of seventeen [[tiger]]s and binding them to the helmet, permanently enchanting it. The magics of this items enhanced the wearer's dexterity, granting them the ability to dodge even the swiftest enemies, and granted them ''[[darkvision]]''.

==History==
Created sometime before [[1372 DR]] by Intulik of the Blood, a powerful and ambitious [[witch doctor]] from Chult. He used the helmet's magics to dispose of political opponents, eventually taking of the power in the region. The subjection could've lasted for decades but was cut short by the sword of [[Tatchalik]] the bounty hunter who claim the ''Spirit of the Predator'' for himself. Later, the helmet accompanied its new master to [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors.

Eventually, the ''Spirit of the Predator'' ended up in the hands of the [[wild elven]] tribe under the leadership of [[Kyleena Moonglow]]. The tribe found themselves pushed out of their Chultan forests and attempted to settle in the [[Lonely Barrens]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in 1372 DR.
