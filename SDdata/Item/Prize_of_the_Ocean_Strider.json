One cunning druid named [[Sarian Badgerriver]] was said to have outwitted the fey and was rewarded with this enchanted blade. If the story was true, it took place long before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], multiple copies of the ''Prize'' existed, found in various hands across the Nelanther Isles and [[Spindrift Town]]."
