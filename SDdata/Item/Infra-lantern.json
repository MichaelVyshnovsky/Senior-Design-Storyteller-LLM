        "mainbody": "Infra-lanterns were a special kind of lantern that greatly boosted a creatures existing infravision.\nAn infra-lantern looked almost exactly like a hooded lantern, except that instead of a wick the lantern had a faceted gem. Instead of emitting light, an infra-lantern worked by emitting almost imperceptible vibrations.\nThe gem inside an infra-lantern was enchanted by drow magic, sometimes called dweomercraft. For that reason, it lost its powers if exposed to sunlight.\nInfra-lanterns were generally not useful for creatures without infravision, since the vibrations emitted could only be detected by someone who already had this capability. Some variants allowed creatures to see by infravision up to a range of 90 ft (27 m), while other variants had the effect of greatly sharpening the visual acuity of those creatures, allowing them to better discern shapes in the dark.This variation depended on the rules used for infravision.\nInfra-lanterns were extremely rare, but were sometimes available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue by special order."
