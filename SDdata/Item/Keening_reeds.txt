'''''Keening reeds''''' were a special type of [[arrow]] created by the [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s of [[Samarach]].

==Description==
These arrows were crafted using a species of long and slender [[reed]] native to the jungles of the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. Topped with thick [[steel]] arrowheads, ''keening reeds'' were not designed to cause damage.

==Powers==
When ''keening reeds'' were loosed, they produced a loud high-pitched whistle that had a chance of deafening its targets and always gave them a headache.

==History==
By the {{yearlink|1374}}, ''keening reeds'' were in use by the [[Shattered Spear tribe|Shattered Spear]] and the [[Stone Knives tribe]]s of Chultan Batiri.
