A '''''manual of quickness of action''''' was a powerful [[magical]] [[book|tome]] that could make the attentive reader more agile and dextrous.

==Powers==
One who studied the text found detailed instructions for physical exercises and recipes for medicinal unguents that could be read and memorized in three days, at which point it disappeared. If these practices were applied dutifully for one month, the user found their quickness and dexterity much improved.

==History==
* The book-collecting [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] held a ''manual'' in his library collection at [[Barrenstone]].
