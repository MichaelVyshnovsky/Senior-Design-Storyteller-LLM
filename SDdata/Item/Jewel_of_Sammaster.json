        "mainbody": "The Jewel of Sammaster was a unique enchanted amulet that harnessed the power of an ancient dracolich.\nThe wearer of the Jewel was granted a powerful ability to call on the dormant powers of an unnamed ancient dracolich to discharge a cone of undead dragons breath upon their enemies.\nMuch of the items history remained unrevealed. However, one thing was known. In the , the Jewel of Sammaster, along with several other enchanted trinkets, fell into the hands of Plinshree, a naiad that guarded decaying waterways of Myth Drannor. She begged the heroes who opposed the Cult of the Dragon to repair the citys ancient water bells. When they succeeded, Plinshree thanked the adventurers with gifts of long-lost magic items that were swept away by Myth Drannors fountains. The naiad had one more special gift for the Veiled Ones, but she wouldve only given it up if the heroes succeeded in slaying the dreaded dracolich Pelendralaar. That last gift was the Jewel of Sammaster."
