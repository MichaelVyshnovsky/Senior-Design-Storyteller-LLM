        "mainbody": "The '''''Jewel of Sammaster''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that harnessed the power of an ancient [[dracolich]].",
        "Powers": "The wearer of the ''Jewel'' was granted a powerful ability to call on the dormant powers of an unnamed ancient dracolich to discharge a cone of [[undead]] [[dragon]]'s breath upon their enemies.",
        "History": "Much of the item's history remained unrevealed. However, one thing was known. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the ''Jewel of Sammaster'', along with several other enchanted trinkets, fell into the hands of [[Plinshree]], a [[naiad]] that guarded decaying waterways of Myth Drannor. She begged the heroes who opposed the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to repair the city's ancient water bells. When they succeeded, Plinshree thanked the adventurers with gifts of long-lost magic items that were swept away by Myth Drannor's fountains. The naiad had one more special gift for the [[Veiled Ones]], but she would've only given it up if the heroes succeeded in slaying the dreaded dracolich [[Pelendralaar]]. That last gift was the ''Jewel of Sammaster''."
