The cloak of stars was an enchanted cloak that originated from Evermeet.
This midnight blue cloak gleamed with hundreds of small stars.
The cloak of stars imparted invisibility from all forms of normal and magical vision if worn on a starry night under the open sky. The cloak also functioned as a strong cloak of protection.
