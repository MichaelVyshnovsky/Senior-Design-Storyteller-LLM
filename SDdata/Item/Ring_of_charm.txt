'''''Rings of charm''''' were minor [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s that allowed the wearer to bewitch [[humanoids]].

==Powers==
These bands of precious metal were inlaid with tiny glowing [[gemstone]]s. The wearer of such ring was able to cast the ''[[charm person]]'' [[spell]] once per day. Additionally, the ring enhanced the wearer's charisma.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a ''ring of charm'' was worn by [[Dolon Daemba]], an envoy from the [[Legion of the Chimera]] to the [[Black Raven Monastery]]. Dolon, presumably, used the ring's magic to sway the [[Aruma Blane]]'s mind on getting involved with the Legion's war against the [[Ten Towns]].
