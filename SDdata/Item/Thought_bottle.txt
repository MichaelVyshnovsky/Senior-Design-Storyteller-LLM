Thought bottles were a type of enchanted bottle that allowed one to store and protect important thoughts, memories, experiences, or even memorized spells.
Some of these bottles were made of thick green glass, while others were made of metal and similar in appearance to an efreeti bottle, with a bottle and stopper usually engraved with intricate runes.
In order to use the bottle one simply had to concentrate on a thought, memory, or memorized spell(s). They then had to uncork the bottle, and then speak its command word. The thought or memory would then be transferred from the users brain into the bottle, leaving them with only the general nature of the thought. For example, if one chose to store the name of a murderer inside a thought bottle then they would only remember that the bottle contained that murderers name. In addition, one could store some or all of their memorized spells within a thought bottle.
Touching a thought bottle and speaking its command word would make any individual instantly knowledgeable of its contents. Uncorking the bottle and speak its command word would cause whatever was store inside it to be transferred into the users brain. However, memorized spells would only transfer back to those who had stored them.
Most thought bottles could hold a single or five thoughts and memories, though some could hold as many as eight separate ones. Each of these thoughts or memories required their own command word.
Creating one of these bottles required the spells demand and modify memory.
Some time in the 14 century DR, Gromph Baenre created thought bottles to store his most powerful spells along with the thoughts that led to their creation. Unlike the standard thought bottle, these allowed any individual to transfer the spells stored within them into their brain.
* Some shairs were known to craft them.
* Some wizards were known to use thought bottles as backups for their spellbooks.
* Long lived races, such as elves, were known to use thought bottles as "memory archives" to save memories that were "cluttering up" their minds.
