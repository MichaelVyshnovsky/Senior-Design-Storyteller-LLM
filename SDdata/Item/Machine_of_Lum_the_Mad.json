        "mainbody": "The Machine of Lum the Mad was an ancient artifact that had several dials and levers. Combinations entered by the users had either very beneficial or absolutely disastrous effects on them.\nThe large, complex contraption had over a hundred sockets, dials and levers, each of different sizes and colors. All of the delicate components led to the machine weighing about 5,500 lbs (2490 kg). The machine housed a container of crystal, such that it could house a small number of creatures, similar in height to humans.\nThe device had the ability to summon planar creatures, including species never seen before. The machine could also wreak havoc on both the user and those outside the contraption. There were over 8.5 Ã— 1048 settings, an absurdly high number that no mortal could ever get through. However, its powers faded with time.\nThe machines place and method of creation predated written history, and thus it was named after its first owner, Baron Lum the Mad of Oerth. The baron was greedy and hungry for power, and came across the device during one of his conquests. Lum was also an artificer, and his skills in this field allowed him to garner some knowledge about the machine.\nGeneral Lum used the machine to summon several monsters to aid in his conquests, and also used it to call down a fire barrage that destroyed his enemies. However, the machine was never meant to be tampered with in such a way, and eventually drove Lum mad. Both Lum and his device were consumed by a mysterious cloud and transported across the multiverse.\nIn, or prior to 1359 DR, the machine appeared on the planet of Toril. More specifically, it was located in Watchers Keep, and was somewhat damaged, but still functioned. Carston, a master wizard, arrived in the keep with his apprentices, and was awed by the Machine of Lum the Mad. He got trapped within the machine, and was stuck for a decade.\n* Lum, the first known owner.\n* Carston, possessor of the machine in the 14-century DR."
