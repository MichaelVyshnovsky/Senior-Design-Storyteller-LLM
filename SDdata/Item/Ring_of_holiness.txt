'''''Rings of holiness''''' were enchanted [[gold]]en [[ring]]s that were popular among the [[cleric]] worshipers of [[Helm]] in the years following the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Powers==
''Rings of holiness'' were divine magic enchanted items that granted their user additional spell slots, one per level for 0 to 4{{th}}, and was only usable by clerics.

Some versions of the ''rings of holiness'' were usable by [[druid]]s and [[shaman]]s.

==History==
The [[Church of Helm]] held a belief that the ''rings of holiness'' were created out of a supremely powerful magical ring that was gifted to [[Helm]] by [[Ao]] for the god's faithful service during the Time of Troubles. Helm diluted the artifact's power and split it into the ''rings of holiness'' to pass the gift upon his followers in the Realms.

Non-Helmite sages and scholars doubted that origin story, as, in their eyes, Ao was above such mundane human emotion as gratitude. Because of that, the Helmite story was considered nothing but propaganda.

==Notable Rings of Holiness==
*'''''Honorary Ring of Sune''''': the version of a ''ring of holiness'' of the [[Sunite]] faith, awarded by the church to its clerics who were recognized for their integrity and kindness.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Ellesime]]: the elven queen of [[Suldanessellar]].
*[[Mulahey]]: the agent of the [[Iron Throne]] responsible for creating the [[iron crisis]].
*[[Xithiss]]: a [[mind flayer]] trader under [[Baeloth Barrityl]]'s control from the [[Black Pits]] of [[Underdark]].
