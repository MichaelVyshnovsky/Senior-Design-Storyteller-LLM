'''Cheese handwheels''' were small handfoods of [[cheese]], often served in taverns,{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190916024409/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-07.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr-Jun 2007| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Description==
Cheese handwheels were prepared using various, usually strong, cheeses and stuffings. [[Onion]]-and-[[mushroom]] handwheels were consumed in [[Cormyr]], while in Waterdeep they were served with dubious meat roasts, and twists of [[saltbread]]s.

==Availability==
*In [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Blushing Mermaid]], cheese handwheels were a popular food among visiting sailors.
*In the [[Dalelands]], a handwheel of cheese and a loaf of hard [[bread]] was a common meal. The [[Drunken Lion]] offered cheese handwheels accompanied by [[ale]], [[wine]], [[zzar]], and a platter of hard [[biscuit]]s.
*In [[the Vast]]'s city of [[Tantras]], the [[Net of Stars]] served handwheels, cheap drinks, and roundloaves of stuffed salty [[bread]].
*In Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]], [[Alamuth's]] was a popular eatery among sailors who often ordered [[longwater wine]], a handwheel of strong [[Waterdhavian cheese]] and [[chicken]]-and-onion handpies. The [[Blue Jack]] tavern sold platters filled with cold meats, [[pickle]]s, handwheels, and hot biscuits topped with melted [[butter]] and [[garlic]] sauce.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, onion-and-mushroom handwheels could be found in the kitchens of [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]]. [[Laspeera Inthr√©]] occasionally stole these treats from the kitchens to feed [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] who often forgot to eat as he was consumed by his work.
