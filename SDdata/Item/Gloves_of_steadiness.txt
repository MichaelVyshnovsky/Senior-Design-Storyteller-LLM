'''''Gloves of steadiness''''' were [[enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] created to be used by archers.

==Description==
A typical pair of ''gloves of steadiness'' were gray and striped.

==Powers==
The magics woven into these gloves steadied the hand, making it significantly easier to land a hit or send an [[arrow]] straight to the target. This made ''gloves of steadiness'' a valued commodity among archers and snipers.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a pair of ''gloves of steadiness'' was worn by one of the [[orog]]s who were tasked with prying open the ''Seal of Mythanthor'', a magical ''[[portal]]'' that connected the [[Halls of Light]] of [[Myth Drannor]] with [[Speculum Grounds]] in the City Heights. The orogs were confronted by a band of adventurers known as the [[Veiled Ones]] and the pair of ''gloves of steadiness'' changed hands.
