Reverberating crossbow of pain possessed a deadly +6 enchantment to its damage, and it dealt additional reverberating sonic damage to its targets. Additionally, the crossbow seemingly had an unlimited supply of magical booming missiles.
In the , reverberating crossbow of pain was lost in the Ashenwood forest of Rashemen. Its owner was found dead, their camp snowed in and frozen stiff. The tragic campsite was located not far from the massive evergreen tree, which was home of the Ashenwoods Wood Man spirit.
