        "mainbody": "'''''Chameleon keys''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] keys that could mimic others, much like their namesake the [[chameleon]],{{Cite dragon/256/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Tools of the Trade|90}}",
        "Description": "These large, [[iron]] keys were mundane in appearance and measured {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in length. Their only unusual characteristic was that they lacked teeth.",
        "Powers": "When pressed up against another key, a ''chameleon key'' would change its size and shape until it became an exact duplicate of the key it was pressed against. It would retain this form until it was pressed up against another key. However, upon the fourth key it was pressed against a ''chameleon key'' would lose its magical effect and become locked in that new form.\n\n''Chameleon keys'' could also be made to duplicate the appearance of other enchanted keys, though they would not inherit that other key's magical properties. They could only open whatever [[lock (item)|locks]] that enchanted key could open, including magical locks.",
        "Notable Owners": "Most guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more ''chameleon keys''."
