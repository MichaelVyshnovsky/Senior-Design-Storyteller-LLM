        "mainbody": "A belt of dwarvenkind, also known as a girdle of dwarvenkind or a girdle of the dwarves, was a belt that bestowed dwarf-like qualities upon the wearer. \nBelts of dwarvenkind were often presented as a gift to individuals who earned friendship or done a great deed for a dwarvish community. They were never earned with ease, as it usually took decades to achieve enough respect among the dwarves. Because of that the belts of dwarvenkind were rarely seen in the hands of humans, and when humans were seen wearing one of these enchanted belts, it was very likely gained via nefarious means.\nThese accessories bestowed robustness upon whomever equipped them, so that they were capable of enduring difficult conditions. The belts made the wearers more charismatic around dwarves. \nOften, these belts made the wearer less charismatic around other races. However, some types of belts of dwarvenkind did not only make the wearer more charming to dwarves, but also other stout folk, such as stout halflings and gnomes.\nDue to the powerful dweomer of this girdle, the wearer could even speak, read, and understand the Dwarven language. As well as this, those who equipped the belt gained darkvision, and could determine how deep the ground beneath them was, as dwarves could. They would also gain resistance to poison and other effects. \nIn addition, they might also grow a grand beard, or a grander beard if they already had one.\nOne of these girdles was stored in the Tilverton mines in the midâ€“14 century DR.\n* Tibold Hillmover"
