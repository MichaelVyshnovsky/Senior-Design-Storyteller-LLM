A '''''ring of spell turning''''' was a type of [[magic]]al [[ring]] that protected the wearer from [[spell]]s that were cast upon them.

==Powers==
After the [[Second Sundering]], whenever a spell specifically targeted the ring's wearer, it bestowed upon them a greater chance of avoiding or resisting its magical effects. In addition there was a slight chance that the ring reflected all but the most-powerful spells back upon their caster. This boon did not affect any spells that merely created an area-of-effect in which the wearer was caught.

''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], these rings mimicked the effects of the spell ''[[spell turning|minor spell turning]]''.

==Notable Owners==
One of these rings was bestowed upon and even saved the life of the apprentice warrior, [[Derek Poodon]] prior to 1369 DR. When Derek was traveling through the [[Cloak Wood]] he stumbled upon two [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. Furious that they had been bothered, the [[mage]]s released a barrage of ''[[magic missile]]s'' upon the hapless traveler, only to have them reflect back upon themselves. Following this encounter, the novice warrior earned the nickname of "Deker the Red Slayer".

[[File:Ring of spell turning WoW.png|thumb|Coriolis Rillevay's ''ring of spell turning''.]]In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an anonymous benefactor gave a ''ring of spell turning'' to the [[adventurer]] and sculptor [[Coriolis Rillevay]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It was stated only that the ''ring'' was meant to serve as payment for an unspecified future work of hers, and was meant to help keep her alive until such time as she could complete it.
