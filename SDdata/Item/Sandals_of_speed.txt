'''''Sandals of speed''''' were [[sandal]]s enchanted with the [[hishna]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.

==Description==
This set of footwear was made from thick leather.

==Powers==
Similar to ''[[boots of speed]]'', this item greatly enhanced the wearer's movement speed. However, unlike the ''boots of speed'', these sandals did not require a period of rest, allowing the wearer to jog for up to sixteen hours in a day.
