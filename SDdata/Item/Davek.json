        "mainbody": "avek was a runic script used by the Dwarven and Giant languages of worlds such as Nerath and Eberron. It was used to a much lesser extent for Dwarven on Toril, where Dethek was widespread.The Forgotten Realms Campaign Set and Dwarves Deep both state that Dethek is just the \"most common\" of a number of dwarven-made scripts, suggesting Davek (which was invented in 4 edition) may be one of these lesser writings. \nOnly those who were versed in Dethek could distinguish Davek from it. Most human commoners, having only a passing familiarity with Dethek, would just recognize Davek script as looking vaguely Dwarvish.\nThis dwarven script originated on another world, likely Nerath, where it was developed to transcribe Dwarven. The Giant language came to use it following the dwarves long servitude to the giants there.\nOver time, planar travelers from these other worlds brought to Toril books written in Davek, items labeled with it, and some knowledge of it until it began to be known on Toril.\nOne group introduced to this alphabet were the dwarves of Ammarindar, who at least partially inscribed their special stepping disks with the script."
