        "mainbody": "ring of genie summoning was a magical ring that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. It was an expanded variant of the more common Faer√ªnean ring of djinni summoning.\nThis magical ring was able to summon a particular genie from its elemental plane when the item was rubbed. Each ring summoned a djinni, dao, efreeti, marid, or a more powerful noble genie variant. A summoned genie served the owner of the ring loyally until the genie was slain. The ring would become an ordinary piece of jewelry upon the genies death. Summoned noble genies left their masters service after granting three wishes.\nIf a shair was powerful enough, they could free regular genies from the ring and were sometimes granted a wish, with the freed genies elders blessing, that was free from any obligation.\n*Adnan al-Raqi, a powerful shair, also known as the Pillar of Wisdom, who lived in Huzuz circa1367 DR.\n*Akura al-Hiyali, a member of the Corsair Council of Hawa in the 14 century DR.\n*Fasim Kaldur, the leader of the Riders of Blood circa 1367 DR.\n*Jamal al-Yindannim, an amorous fire mage in the 14 century DR.\n*Khaldun al-Hanif, a legendary sheikh of the Al-Badia tribes of the Haunted Lands in the 14 century DR.\n*Mabruk al-Hanash, a member of House of Reehan, whose rings servant was efreeti Saleh in the 14 century DR.\n*The Head, a lich from the Hall of Lost Kings in the in the 14 century DR."
