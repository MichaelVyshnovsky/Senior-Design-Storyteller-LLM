        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of genie summoning''''' was a [[enchanted|magical]] [[ring]] that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. It was an expanded variant of the more common [[Faer√ªn]]ean ''[[ring of djinni summoning]]''.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}",
        "Powers": "This magical ring was able to [[summon]] a particular [[genie]] from its [[elemental plane]] when the item was rubbed. Each ring summoned a [[djinni]], [[dao]], [[efreeti]], [[marid]], or a more powerful [[noble genie]] variant. A summoned genie served the owner of the ring loyally until the genie was slain. The ring would become an ordinary piece of jewelry upon the genie's death. Summoned noble genies left their master's service after granting three ''[[wish]]es''.\n\nIf a [[sha'ir]] was powerful enough, they could free regular genies from the ring and were sometimes granted a ''wish'', with the freed genie's elders' blessing, that was free from any obligation.",
