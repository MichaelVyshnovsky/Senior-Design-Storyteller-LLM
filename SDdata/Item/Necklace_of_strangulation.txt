A '''''necklace of strangulation''''' was a sinister [[enchanted]] piece of jewelry whose [[curse]]d power was only revealed when placed around the neck.

==Powers==
Immediately after being placed around the neck, a ''necklace of strangulation'' would constrict, making it impossible for the victim to breathe and resulting in their death after several minutes. The [[magic]] of the necklace could only be negated by a ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]''. The necklace's magic was also masked by [[spell]]s such as ''[[detect curse]]''. The ''necklace of strangulation'' continued to squeeze tightly to the victim's neck long after their death until nothing remained by a dried skeleton.
