The '''''Spear of Kerish''''' was the aptly named [[enchanted]] [[spear]] wielded by [[Kerish]], the [[frost salamander]] leader of the [[Wyrm's Tooth glacier]] on the [[Spine of the World]].

==Powers==
The ''Spear of Kerish'' was a truly unusual [[polearm]]. It was constructed out of an unknown light and transparent crystalline material. The weapon's spearhead appeared to be a frozen icicle affixed onto the crystalline haft. The weapon radiated a mist of fine ice crystals. When wielded in combat, the ''Spear of Kerish'' functioned as an enchanted ''+3'' spear that occasionally dealt additional magical cold damage. While holding the weapon, its owner became somewhat resistant to mundane and magical fires.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the ''Spear of Kerish'' was wielder by Kerish, who resided in the [[Aquatic Museum]] deep in the Wyrm's Tooth glacier. The frost salamander leader allied himself with the Revered Brother [[Poquelin]], who sought ruination and conquest of [[Icewind Dale]]. Eventually, Poquelin was defeated by a group of heroes. However, the fate of the ''Spear of Kerish'' and the frost salamander remained uncertain.
