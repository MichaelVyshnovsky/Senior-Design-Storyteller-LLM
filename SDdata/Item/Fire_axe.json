        "mainbody": "'''''Fire axes''''' were aptly-named [[enchanted]] [[throwing axe]] that gained certain popularity in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] along the [[Sword Coast]] region.",
        "Description": "These axes' enchantments were obvious from their warm glow. ''Fire axes'', along with other similar items were treated with suspicion by [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s, and with open hate and hostility by [[treant]]s.",
        "Powers": "''Fire axes'' exploded in magical flames when they reach their targets. Additionally, they were enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment. These thrown weapons were designed to be used by strong wielders, rather than by dextrous, dealing additional damage the stronger the thrower was.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], a handful of there enchanted throwing axes could be found on a body of an unlucky adventurer found partially devoured and gnawed by a pack of ravenous [[worg]]s in one of the small caves in the [[Wild Hills]] of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]]."
