        "mainbody": "Fire axes were aptly-named enchanted throwing axe that gained certain popularity in the late 14 century DR along the Sword Coast region.\nThese axes enchantments were obvious from their warm glow. Fire axes, along with other similar items were treated with suspicion by druids and rangers, and with open hate and hostility by treants.\nFire axes exploded in magical flames when they reach their targets. Additionally, they were enhanced with a +1 enchantment. These thrown weapons were designed to be used by strong wielders, rather than by dextrous, dealing additional damage the stronger the thrower was.\nIn 1372 DR, a handful of there enchanted throwing axes could be found on a body of an unlucky adventurer found partially devoured and gnawed by a pack of ravenous worgs in one of the small caves in the Wild Hills of the Delimbiyr Vale."
