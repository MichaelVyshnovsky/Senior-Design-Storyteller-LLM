            "Offensive Powers": "Touching a target with the ''blast scepter'' would stun them similar to the ''[[power word, stun]]'' [[spell]] for one minute. This power expended a single charge.\n\nExpending two charges would create a shock wave that would stun targets within a cone up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} distant. In addition to causing physical harm and breaking some carried objects, the shock wave would knock targets off of their feet.\n\nOnce per day a ''blast scepter'' could be used to powerstrike a touched opponent at the cost of five charges. This powerstrike would cause a great deal of physical harm to the target.\n\nNewly-crafted scepters held 50 charges, while others had between 5–60 charges. Most scepters found during the [[Era of Upheaval]] had only between one to 10 charges."
