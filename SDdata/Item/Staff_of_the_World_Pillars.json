In the hands of the Forgotten God this staff was powered by the beliefs and sacrifices of the Forgotten God's loyal [[yikarian]] followers, meaning that it could be used without expending a charge like other magical staves. The ''Staff of the World Pillars'' possessed 40 irreplaceable charges in the hands of anyone but the Forgotten God."
