Agathas spear of stirring was a large enchanted spear-like culinary utensil that belonged to a frost giant named Agatha the Cook in the 14 century DR.
The spear of stirring possessed a +2 enchantment and could magically heat up. When wielded as a weapon, the spear scorched its targets.
In 1374 DR, the spear of stirring was wielded by Agatha the Cook, the aptly named cook of the nomadic frost giant Bloodaxe. The giants ventured too close to the town of Voonlar during the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis and hunted out of a cave not far from Shind Road, feeding on travelers and Zhentarim troops. Agatha had her hands full with all the cooking and used the spears magic to instantly bring her stew cauldrons to the boiling point.
Subsequently, the Bloodaxes were bribed by Cheswick Goldwaters, a greater doppelganger agent of the unseen, to abduct the wife of the man it impersonated, a Sembian noblewoman Amberlyn Goldwaters. The Unseen wanted the Hero of Daggerford to die rescuing the woman, but instead the hero and the companions slew the man-eating frost giants, picking up Agathas spear of stirring from the evil cooks dead hands.
