Clouts were undergaments worn by most folks of the Realms. They were made of a tight belt worn around the hips, and of a long strip of cloth passed between the legs, slipped in the belt on the front and back of the body, and left to dangle.
The belt of the clouts could be manufactured from various different materials the most durable were made of leather, but cheaper alternatives could be made of cloth or even cord. They were usually closed on the front using small hooks.
The strip of cloth passed between the legs was made of fabric, usually cotton. The dangling ends were often designed to be tied together, and was folded on itself by horse riders to provide additional padding and absorbancy.
While most clouts were basic undergarments, some were decorative, made "to be seen", or even sold freshly-perfumed. Such novelty items could be found in big cities such as Waterdeep.
