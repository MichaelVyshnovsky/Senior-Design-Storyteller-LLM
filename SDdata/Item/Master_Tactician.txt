==Description==
[[File:Red-Knight symbol.jpg|thumb|200x|''The [[holy symbol]] of the [[Red Knight]]'']]
The military tome was bound to resemble ''[[The Red Book of War]]'', a holy text of [[Tempus]]' faith. It was described as a large, one foot square book in very good condition, bound between two sheets of flat-beaten metal. The front cover was stamped with the symbol of the Red Knight. The text of the book was inscrbed on heavy parchment, in the [[Chessentan language]], horizontally ruled and with wide margins. The primary text was written in large block letters in black [[ink]], but two other people have since written comments, in a smaller hand, down the margins. All of the text was written 

The book was published some time after [[1343 DR]].

==Contents==
The cover page read: 
{{Quote|"Master Tactician -- Magic to Aid the Art of War, Penned by [[Nicos Nathos]], Priest of the Lady of Strategy, Praise Her and the Lord of Battles."}}

The first 40 pages of the book described military formations for dozens to hundreds of troops, group fighting tactics for the same, and advice for dealing with enemy war strategies. It also provided information about different [[humanoid|humanoids']] pertinent abilities and the war beasts they commanded in battle. The annotations in the margins offered strategies against specific types of humanoids or for use in different weather conditions, and were added by adventuring [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of the Red Knight.

The remainder of the pages described spells used by the [[Church of the Red Knight]], namely: <br/>
''[[checkmate's light]]'' &bull; ''[[know protections]]'' &bull; ''[[telepathic aura]]''

==History==
''Master Tactician'' was penned in [[1348 DR]] by Nicos Nathos, an adventuring cleric of the Red Knight. After a successful career as a mercenary commander on the [[Dragon Coast]]. Upon retiring back to his native city of [[Cimbar]] due to old age, the mercenary took to summarizing his campaigns and the tactics he'd used to achieve victory. After the death of its author in [[1358 DR]], it remained in the Cimbaran Temple of Tempus until a small temple of the Red Knight was built in [[1359 DR]]. There it was used as a teaching tool for teaching tool for priests of the faith, both in war and the Red Knight's secret magic. During this time it was also available for viewing at request but was forbidden to remove without permission from the temple elder.

As of [[Mirtul 3]], [[1373 DR]], it had been stolen by Knight [[Artula Porolos]], a young cleric of the Red Knight that planned to use it as a reference for her campaign to bring order to the [[Border Kingdoms]]. The [[Church of the Red Knight]] sought the book's return, but did not want her to be harmed in the process.
