        "mainbody": "A '''''great elixir''''' was a powerful and dangerously unpredictable solution that was just as lethal as it was rewarding. The legend of this potion was one of the most famous examples of the [[magic]] of [[Halruaa]], where for a time it was used as a punishment for those convicted of capital crimes.",
        "Description": "The elixir itself was a twinkling and translucent aquamarine liquid that always appeared to be in swirling motion. Its taste was said to be like that of fine [[wine]] on fire.",
        "Possible effects": "The effect of drinking the elixir was completely random. It could have one, or a combination of, the following effects on the imbiber:<ref>\n* Instant death;\n* [[Feeblemind]]edness, as per the [[spell]];\n* An infection of [[mindfire]];\n* Permanent blindness;\n* Permanent [[darkvision]] out to {{SI|90|ft}};\n* Uncontrolled, daily ''[[shapechange]]s'', as per the spell;\n* Affliction of [[lycanthropy]];\n* Gain the uncanny tracking abilities of a [[ranger]];\n* Gain an immunity to an entire [[school of magic]];\n* Gain or loss of intelligence, charm, heartiness, strength, ''etc''.; and\n* Gain of abilities that mimicked the spells ''[[mage armor]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'' ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[greater spell immunity]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[pass without trace]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', or ''[[wraithform]]''.",
        "History": "The first version of a ''great elixir'' was most likely concocted in ancient [[Netheril]] often being incorrect in some manner and therefore deadlier.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a [[Red Wizard of Thay]] was rumored to have obtained three abilities that mimicked spells from drinking a ''great elixir''.<ref>"
