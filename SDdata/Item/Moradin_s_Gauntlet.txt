Moradins Gauntlet was a gauntlet customarily worn by the dwarf overseers of the dwarven forge-complex Hrakhamar in the land of Chult.
It was well crafted gauntlet sized for an adult dwarf and fashioned from gold.
While it was valued at 2,500 gp, a wealthy dwarf would pay double that to have it.
By the late 15 century, it rested in the treasury of Hrakhamar.
The Chultan dwarf spirit warrior and guide Musharib sought adventures to help sneak into Hrakhamars treasury and reclaim Moradins Gauntlet, in order to deny it to the firenewts whod taken over the facility.
