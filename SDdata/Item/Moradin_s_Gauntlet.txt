'''Moradin's Gauntlet''' was a gauntlet customarily worn by the [[dwarf]] overseers of the dwarven forge-complex [[Hrakhamar]] in the land of [[Chult]].

==Description==
It was well crafted gauntlet sized for an adult dwarf and fashioned from [[gold]].

==Value==
While it was valued at 2,500 [[gp]], a wealthy dwarf would pay double that to have it.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century, it rested in the treasury of Hrakhamar.

The [[Chultan dwarf]] [[spirit warrior]] and guide [[Musharib]] sought adventures to help sneak into Hrakhamar's treasury and reclaim Moradin's Gauntlet, in order to deny it to the [[firenewt]]s who'd taken over the facility.
