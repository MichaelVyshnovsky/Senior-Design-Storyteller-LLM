        "mainbody": "A '''''bone ring''''' was a magic [[ring]] that protected the wearer's life-force and physical strength from [[magic]]al and [[Necromancy|nectromantic]] effects that would drain them.",
        "Description": "Despite its name, it could be made from bone, stone, or [[ivory]], but would never be made from any [[:Category:Metals|metals]]. It was worth between 20,000 and 36,000 [[gold piece]]s.",
        "Powers": "The ring would protect its wearer from being drained of life energy and health, such as an attack by a [[vampire]]. However, each time it protected the wearer, a charge was used up, and when all charges were gone, it crumbled to dust. It was rumored that one-in-twenty such rings could also absorb the [[arcane spell]]s of [[necromancer]]s.",
        "Creation": "Creation of a ''bone ring'' required the spell ''[[negative energy protection]]''. While hints of its creation could be found in [[Nebt Bhakau]]'s ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', the only known complete instructions lay in a treatise on necromantic [[divine magic]] known as ''[[On Coming Forth by Day]]''."
