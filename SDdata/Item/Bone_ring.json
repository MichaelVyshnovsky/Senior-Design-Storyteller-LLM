        "mainbody": "A bone ring was a magic ring that protected the wearers life-force and physical strength from magical and nectromantic effects that would drain them.\nDespite its name, it could be made from bone, stone, or ivory, but would never be made from any metals. It was worth between 20,000 and 36,000 gold pieces.\nThe ring would protect its wearer from being drained of life energy and health, such as an attack by a vampire. However, each time it protected the wearer, a charge was used up, and when all charges were gone, it crumbled to dust. It was rumored that one-in-twenty such rings could also absorb the arcane spells of necromancers.\nCreation of a bone ring required the spell negative energy protection. While hints of its creation could be found in Nebt Bhakaus Book of Shadows, the only known complete instructions lay in a treatise on necromantic divine magic known as On Coming Forth by Day."
