'''''Celestial Fury''''' was a powerful magical [[katana]] from [[Shou Lung]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It carried the spirit of a [[celestial]] and powers of thunder and lightning.

==Description==
The sword had a very ornate, crimson-colored hilt.

==Powers==
''Celestial Fury'' was a magical ''+3 katana''.

On striking a foe, it could emit booming thunder that might stun them briefly, and had a small chance of inflicting a shocking blow that did intense electrical damage.

Moreover, once a day, the wielder could blind a single target within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} for a brief time. Also once a day, they could create a lightning strike that hit a single target within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}.

==History==
Once, a [[trumpet archon]] called [[Chin Yi]] fell in love with a mortal man of Shou Lung. Moreover, Chin Yi vowed that if he ever had to go to war, then she would protect him.

However, when this came to pass, [[Kwan Ying]], goddess of compassion and Chin Yi's patron, did not want to add to the violence and refused Chin Yi permission to join her love in war. When a [[yuan-ti]] warlord killed him, the grieving Chin Yi flew into a rage and descended on the battlefield, heedless of Kwan Ying's warnings. Chin Yi seized her love's katana and slew the warlord and went on to slaughter the yuan-ti forces.

Then Kwan Ying appeared before Chin Yi, sympathetic and with arms wide, offering "If it will stop this slaughter, I will ease your pain and end your suffering." However, Chin Yi declared "I do not wish to end my suffering. I wish for my fury to sound throughout the ages, now and forever." Kwan Ying wished to respect her servant's wishes but could not let her fury loose on the world, so she bound Chin Yi's spirit to her beloved's blade, creating ''Celestial Fury''. Chin Yi's cries could be from the steel. She then hid the sword in the tomb of a warrior.

However, tomb robbers later stole the sword, but by now Chin Yi's cries were quietened.

Many centuries later, in [[1369 DR|1369 DR (Shou Year 2619)]], ''Celestial Fury'' was in the possession of a slaver named [[Koshi]], who frequented a guarded compound within the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].
