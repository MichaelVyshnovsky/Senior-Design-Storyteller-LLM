The '''Dragon Throne''' was the throne of the king of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
The Dragon Throne, as its name suggests, was carved in the likeness of a great [[dragon]]. The throne had a high back that was taller than any [[human]]. It was crafted from a dark material.

It sat upon a raised dais on the northern wall of the [[Chamber of the Purple Dragon]] in the [[Royal Court (Cormyr)|Royal Court of Cormyr]] in [[Suzail]].

==History==
Shortly after Cormyr was founded in the {{YearlinkName|26}}, the first king, [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], renovated a large meeting hall constructed by his father, [[Ondeth Obarskyr|Ondeth]], and made it into his throne room at the Royal Court. He commissioned the construction of the Dragon Throne, which remained the throne of Cormyr for over a thousand years.

Only the king was permitted to sit upon the Dragon Throne.
