        "Description": "These [[magic]] gauntlets looked like a standard pair of leather gauntlets, but when worn, magically fit to the perfect size for the wearer. They radiated magic, and thus could only be discovered by ''[[detect magic|detecting magic]]'' or similar means.\n\nThe less dexterous the wearer was, the better the gauntlets functioned. They also allowed the wearer to pick locks or pickpocket others; if the wearer was already versed in these skills, they would become more proficient at them.",
