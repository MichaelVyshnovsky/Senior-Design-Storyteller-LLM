A '''''chardalyn''''' ({{Pronounce|CHAR|dah|lin|refs=}}) was a rare, naturally occurring substance mined in nugget form in the [[North Faerûn|northern]] and [[Northwest Faerûn|northwestern]] regions of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
When first discovered in Netheril, these oval-shaped were described as "useless rocks" by miners, but their affinity for magic was soon discovered. These nuggets were as brittle as glass and turned into a powder when they were forcefully struck or when hurled against a solid object. Until the early [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], the rarity and fragility of ''chardalyns'' contributed to their high base value of 20,000 [[gp]]. Once techniques like [[magic|gem magic]] became more widespread, the base value of ''chardalyns'' dropped to 8,000 gp for a large stone that could hold the most powerful magics, and even lower for smaller, more limited stones.

==Powers==
A single ''chardalyn'' could absorb one spell, which was released when the stone was crushed or destroyed. This was a natural ability of the substance and did not require any magical preparation or treatment beforehand. The spell stayed encased in the ''chardalyn'' indefinitely&mdash;it could be released seconds or centuries later. Usually, the spell was cast with the ''chardalyn'' as the target and it was absorbed without fail, but an empty ''chardalyn'' had a slightly better than even chance to absorb a spell that did not target it directly, as long as it was in the spell's area of effect. Once a ''chardalyn'' was imbued with a spell, additional spells had no effect on the stone. When shattered, the attributes (power, volume, duration, damage, ''etc.'') of the spell were unchanged and the focal point was the exact location where the breakage occurred.

The ancient [[Netherese]] tried for many years to find a use for the powder residue left behind after smashing a ''chardalyn'', but to no avail.

The [[Epic magic|epic]] [[arcanist]] spell ''[[Mavin's earthfast]]'' required six ''chardalyn'' imbued with ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'' spells as one of its material components.

==History==
These magical stones were first discovered (by [[humans]]) in ancient [[Netheril]] near the city of [[Fluvion]], where the [[Wont Surge]] joined the [[Zweihaus River]], in {{Yearlink|-1205}} (NY 2654) by an arcanist named [[Elorian]]. Miners brought her what they considered useless rocks, but she sensed they were magical and soon discovered their capacity for spell storage and release. This tremendous discovery brought immediate prosperity to Fluvion and ushered in what historians called the [[History of Netheril#Age of Discovery|Age of Discovery]] that lasted for over half a millennium. on the [[Plain of Standing Stones]].

''Chardalyns'' were known to the [[sarrukh]] millennia before the Netherese discovered them. A vast cache of ''chardalyn'' stones, long forgotten by all but the incredibly ancient [[Terraseer]] (a sarrukh [[lich]] from [[Isstosseffifil]] who visited the Netherese in disguise), was buried deep below the foothills north of the [[Sword Mountains]] near the [[Sword Coast]]. In {{Yearlink|-2368}} (NY 1491), the Terraseer manipulated the Netherese to build an outpost there and dig a well that would never run dry. In the process of this expedition, the Netherese army had to kill thousands of [[owlbear]]s and other monsters, eventually slaying the [[deepspawn]] that guarded the lost chamber. The Terraseer got his ''chardalyns'', but the outpost, [[Quesseer]], lasted less than 300 years and only the [[Old Owl Well]] was left.<ref group="note">There is a major discrepancy in the sourcebooks about the discovery of ''chardalyns'' by the Netherese. This story, from ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]'' (p. 107), goes on to state that after the cache of ''chardalyns'' was recovered, research in gem magic became popular, but it also states (p. 103) that the discovery of a ''chardalyn'' mine caused the abandonment of gem magic at the start of the Age of Discovery almost 1200 years later. One way to explain this would be that the Terraseer managed to hide the true nature of ''chardalyn'' stones from the Netherese.

In the [[1360 DR|1360s]] and [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], the [[Riders of Nesmé]] had some veteran members that were equipped with [[shield]]s studded with ''chardalyn'' stones that were charged with ''[[fireball]]'' spells, so a weapon striking one of these gave the enemy and those nearby a face full of fire. The Riders wore ''[[ring of fire resistance|rings of fire resistance]]'' to protect themselves against the blasts.

==Notable Owners==
[[Delfen Ondabarl]] of Daggerford was known to have a few ''chardalyn'' in his possession, but the spells with which they were imbued were a secret.
