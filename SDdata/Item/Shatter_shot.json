        "mainbody": "hatter shot was a specific variety of particularly explosive mage shot.\nThis type of ammunition consisted of a resilient clay pot filled with fluid that exploded upon impact after being hurled by a catapult from the deck of a spelljammer. The mixture would rapidly expand when exposed to air, typically found within the air envelope of a ship. It was capable of destroying structures such as the hull of a ship or even stone constructs."
