The '''''Claws of the Owl''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] boots created by the [[Rashemi]] [[wizard]] [[Shevarith Kendia]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As Shevarith strode across a battlefield, the design of the ''Claws'' along with the rest of her clothing was intended to invoke the splendor of the snowy [[owl]]s of [[Rashemen]] in flight. The ''Claws'' were also complemented by her ''[[Mask of the Owl]]''.

==Powers==
The ''Claws of the Owl'' drew power from movement, and used this power to reinvigorate Shevarith's [[magical]] energies.

==History==
Snowy owls had left a strong impression on Shevarith ever since she was a girl and witnessed one use a screech to paralyze its prey with fear.

==Notable Owners==
* Shevarith Kendia, who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
