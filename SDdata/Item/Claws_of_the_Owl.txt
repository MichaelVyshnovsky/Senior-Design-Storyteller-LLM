The Claws of the Owl were a pair of enchanted boots created by the Rashemi wizard Shevarith Kendia in the late 15 century DR.
As Shevarith strode across a battlefield, the design of the Claws along with the rest of her clothing was intended to invoke the splendor of the snowy owls of Rashemen in flight. The Claws were also complemented by her Mask of the Owl.
The Claws of the Owl drew power from movement, and used this power to reinvigorate Shevariths magical energies.
Snowy owls had left a strong impression on Shevarith ever since she was a girl and witnessed one use a screech to paralyze its prey with fear.
* Shevarith Kendia, who worked as an adventurer on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, during the late 15 century DR.
