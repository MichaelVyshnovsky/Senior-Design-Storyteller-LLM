Some substances, such as [[coal]] dust and [[tar]], were used to blacken facial features, add dramatic lines, or to better conceal themselves in darkness. Conversely, some substances were used for the purposes of lightening features, such as [[flour]]. Some were used to add color, such as the [[cochineal]] powder of [[Maztica]], which used to redden lips and cheeks. Makeup could also include skin putty, which was used to add circles beneath ones eyes or make their nose appear longer, and oil to add a sheen of gloss to one's skin.",
