A moondrop pendant was a magical amulet associated with the Selûnite faith.
These pendants bore a design of a crescent moon.
The wearer of a moondrop pendant gained a power referred to those knowledgeable about it as writing dance. Whenever they became gravely wounded, a wearer became much more adept at slipping away from any nearby foes, not allowing them to make opportune attacks against their person.
