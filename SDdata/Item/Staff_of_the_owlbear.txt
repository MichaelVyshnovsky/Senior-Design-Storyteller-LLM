A staff of the owlbear was an enchanted shaman staff found in the jungles of Chult in the late 15 century DR.
These weapons were intricately carved and decorated with owlbear feathers and leather thongs. Staves of the owlbear possessed a +2 enchantment and slightly improved the powers of the wielder and their allies alike.
