A '''''vestment of power''''' was a [[magic item]] usually worn by ranking [[priest]]s of the various faiths in [[Faerûn]]. Roughly one quarter of all mid-to-high ranking priests wore a form of a ''vestment of power''.

==Description==
These items usually appeared in the form of a set of ceremonial [[robe]]s.

==Powers==
Two forms of the ''vestment of power'' existed—the ''[[lesser vestment of power]]'' and ''[[greater vestment of power]]''. Both granted a variety of useful magical abilities and protections to the wearer.
