The iron circlet was a unique magic item that could be found within the Rainbow Monastery in the Hordelands.
The iron circlet worn by the grinning statue of Byubo, the Padhrasattva of nyum, found within the Rainbow Monastery.
This simple crown emitted a magical aura detectable by spells.
The iron circlet aided in protecting its wearer from physical attacks. However, if a single word of pride was said while wearing the circlet, it instantly became a cursed item, making it easier for the wearer to be struck by physical attacks.
The cursed version of the iron circlet could only be removed with a remove curse spell or a wish.
