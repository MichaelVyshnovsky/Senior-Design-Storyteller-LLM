        "mainbody": "Thieving helmets were special helmets worn by some rogues.\nOne of the most important senses to a thief is his sense of hearing. Common helmets muffled the ability to hear lock mechanisms or approaching guards, among other things. A thief wanting to protect their head and still be able to hear had the option of wearing a thieving helmet. \nThieving helmets were invented by a gnome from Waterdeep. They had special ear canals added to the structure of the helmet that amplified incoming sound to a thiefs ear. These helmets sacrificed some structural protection in order to make way for the ear canals, but were better than nothing.\nA thieving helmet cost 10 gold pieces."
