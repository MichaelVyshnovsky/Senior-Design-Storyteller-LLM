A '''''Farrberjik''''' was an item that could be used to line the inside of [[boots]].

==Description==
When boots were lined with ''Farrberjiks'', they effectively became [[magic]]al. These boots allowed the wearer to jump much further than usual, and potentially move faster. Thus, ''Farrberjiks'' could be used to transform ordinary boots into ''[[boots of striding and leaping]]''.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Farrberjik'' boots could be purchased from [[Farr Windward]].
