}}'''Twinkle''' was [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]'s left-handed defensive [[scimitar]]. it was forged by the [[elves]] of old.

==Powers==
It had the powers of a ''defender +5 scimitar''''Heroes' Lorebook'' mistakenly gives the name "Twinkle" to the ''frostbrand'' scimitar later known as "Icingdeath". or a ''+2 [[defending]] scimitar''.The ''defender''/''defending'' property has is given to Twinkle in sourcebooks, but is generally not apparent in the novels in which it appears.

It was partially empathic and could impart weak, base emotions upon its wielder.

==History==
{{fq
| float  =

| source = [[Malchor Harpell]]
| text   = It was forged in the magic of the powers that all the surface elves hold dear, of the stars and the moon and the mysteries of their souls. You deserve it, Drizzt Do'Urden, and it will serve you well.}}The blade was given to Drizzt by [[Malchor Harpell]] in [[1356 DR]], when the [[Companions of the Hall]] were chasing [[Artemis Entreri]] after he had kidnapped [[Regis]].

The sword was later broken, and then repaired, but without all of the strong defensive magic it formerly had.<ref>

Later on, Catti-brie combined the blade with another sword, ''[[Vidrinath]]'', by using the Great Forge of [[Gauntlgrym]]. With the help of the [[Maegera|primordial]] guiding her, the act not only restored much of blade's former ability but also greatly improved its cutting edge and defensive power as well. Drizzt noted that the new blade had become superior to the original ''Twinkle'' after wielding it in mock combat.
