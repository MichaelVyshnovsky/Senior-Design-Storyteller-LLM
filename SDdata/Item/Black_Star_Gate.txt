The black star gate was a portal.
The gate transported people from Elbulders ruins, in a location where they crossed the Old Road, the River Arran, to a tomb-knoll in the marsh of Chelimber. It activated when people carried black rocks such as jet or obsidian.
Its name came from a record in an old book in Candlekeep.
