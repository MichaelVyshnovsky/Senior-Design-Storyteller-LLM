        "mainbody": "'''''The Hammer of Lucerne''''' was a strange [[enchanted]] [[pole-arm]], the first of its kind, forged and ensorcelled long before the beginning of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''Oh, and pray thee bless it as well... thou dost know, that one where it explodes undead and what-not, so that I might smite things most explosively.''|Lodur Iron-Bollocks}}",
        "Description": "''The Hammer of Lucerne'' was an off amalgamation of a [[halberd]] and a [[warhammer]]. It had a four-pronged hammerhead, topped with a long and sharp spike. The weapon's haft was etched with magical runes.",
        "Powers": "The weapon was ensorcelled with a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand. However, it was deadly to the undead and [[outsider]]s. Each strike with ''The Hammer of Lucerne'' had a chance of destroying such creatures instantly.",
        "History": "''The Hammer of Lucerne'' was created as a result of a mistake. It was commissioned by [[Lodur the Brave]], also known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard. He was a strong but dim-witted [[cleric]] who heard of tales of strange and mighty pole-arm weapons. They were possibly once wielded by a hero named Lucerne or maybe came from a place called Lucerne. He was also unsure if Lucerne, the place, had anything to do with the far-away land or a king or a [[deity]] called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\" This clear-as-mud commission was followed up by another request from Lodur – to have the weapon ''[[bless]]ed'' so it exploded [[undead]].\n\nLodur the Foolhardy was a very wealthy man, and his [[gold]] was enough to convince the [[dwarf|dwarven]] arms-master to do as the man asked quietly. The smith promised the ''The Hammer of Lucerne'' would be ready in two months. The arms-master consulted his clan's lore-master, and surprisingly, a weapon that Lodur the Dullard commissioned did exist. It was recorded that such a weapon came from a trader from the extra-planar city of [[Sigil]] who traversed the planes extensively. The arms-master used the weapon from Sigil's designs.\n\nWhen the time to collect the weapon came, Lodur Iron-Bollocks returned to the stronghold but was shocked to find an odd-looking spiked pole-arm instead of a mighty [[hammer]] he expected. As a cleric, he was not allowed to wield a piercing weapon as such. Lodur raged and ranted at the master smith but eventually left the so-called \"Lucerne Hammer\" and full payment behind.\n\nCenturies later, the original ''Hammer of Lucerne'' ended up in the hands of [[Aruma Blane]] in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. Aruma was a [[monk]] of the [[Black Raven Monastery]] on the [[Spine of the World]]."
