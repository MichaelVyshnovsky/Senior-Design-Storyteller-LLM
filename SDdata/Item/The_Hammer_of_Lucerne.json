        "mainbody": "The Hammer of Lucerne was a strange enchanted pole-arm, the first of its kind, forged and ensorcelled long before the beginning of the 14 century DR.\nThe Hammer of Lucerne was an off amalgamation of a halberd and a warhammer. It had a four-pronged hammerhead, topped with a long and sharp spike. The weapons haft was etched with magical runes.\nThe weapon was ensorcelled with a simple +1 enchantment that guided the wielders hand. However, it was deadly to the undead and outsiders. Each strike with The Hammer of Lucerne had a chance of destroying such creatures instantly.\nThe Hammer of Lucerne was created as a result of a mistake. It was commissioned by Lodur the Brave, also known as Lodur Iron-Bollocks, Lodur the Foolhardy, and Lodur the Dullard. He was a strong but dim-witted cleric who heard of tales of strange and mighty pole-arm weapons. They were possibly once wielded by a hero named Lucerne or maybe came from a place called Lucerne. He was also unsure if Lucerne, the place, had anything to do with the far-away land or a king or a deity called Swizaria, or Switzlund, or \"something of that nature, I am most certain.\" This clear-as-mud commission was followed up by another request from Lodur â€“ to have the weapon blessed so it exploded undead.\nLodur the Foolhardy was a very wealthy man, and his gold was enough to convince the dwarven arms-master to do as the man asked quietly. The smith promised the The Hammer of Lucerne would be ready in two months. The arms-master consulted his clans lore-master, and surprisingly, a weapon that Lodur the Dullard commissioned did exist. It was recorded that such a weapon came from a trader from the extra-planar city of Sigil who traversed the planes extensively. The arms-master used the weapon from Sigils designs.\nWhen the time to collect the weapon came, Lodur Iron-Bollocks returned to the stronghold but was shocked to find an odd-looking spiked pole-arm instead of a mighty hammer he expected. As a cleric, he was not allowed to wield a piercing weapon as such. Lodur raged and ranted at the master smith but eventually left the so-called \"Lucerne Hammer\" and full payment behind.\nCenturies later, the original Hammer of Lucerne ended up in the hands of Aruma Blane in the . Aruma was a monk of the Black Raven Monastery on the Spine of the World."
