Ondals wines were white or golden wines made by the mage and vintner Ondal prior to the spellplague of 1385 DR, when Ondals manor and most of his wine cellar was destroyed.  A few wagonloads of wine escaped destruction and these were soon recovered and dispersed throughout the Realms.  
The wine was noteworthy in that the Spellplague infused wild magic into the bottles and, whenever a bottle was opened, uncontrolled destructive magic was released. Numerous groups attempted to find the remaining bottles and either destroy them or use them for nefarious purposes.
