        "mainbody": "helm of opposite alignment was a cursed helmet, whose dweomer could transform a wearers heart into all they werent.\nMost such helms were average metal caps. At least one, however, had been jeweled, while another was silver and made in the shape of a dragons head.\nAs soon as one wore such a helm, it caused them to flip their behavior, aligning their soul with the opposite aspects that it had been aligned previously. This altered their worldview, inverted their morality, and turned around their ethical outlook. The helm instantly lost all power, but the once-wearer was compelled to view any inversion of their changes with horror, and to relish their new perspective on all matters.\nAn amulet of protection from alignment change could block their powers. Interestingly, faith incarnates rendered their host immune to helms of opposite alignment.\n* One such helm was in the area beneath Maddgoths Castle, within Undermountain, in the mid-late 14 century DR.\n* One such helm had been abandoned in the Pits of Everfall within the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak.\n* Nicknack, an ettin druid, was set on his path by such a helm.\n* Jonathon Morningmist had been affected by one such device.\n* Smallfry, a halfling dweller of Skullport."
