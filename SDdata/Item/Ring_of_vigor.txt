A ring of vigor was an enchanted ring that had restorative powers.
The ring was a simple golden band with a single rectangular aquamarine gemstone.
Although it did not always function, a ring of vigor bestowed the wearer with a "cleansing touch" that allowed them to magically heal and cleanse themselves of negative ailments.
* Nayeli Goldflower, a paladin from Daggerford, had a ring of vigor in the late 15 century DR.
