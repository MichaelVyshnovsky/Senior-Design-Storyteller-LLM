}}'''Black sapphire''' was a rare variety of [[sapphire]] found mainly in [[south Faer√ªn]], particularly around the [[Great Rift]] where the [[dwarves]] of the [[Deep Realm]] prized them greatly.

==Description==
These stones were an inky, lustrous black that reflected white or yellow highlights and were facet-cut in the same way as their blue cousins.

==Powers==
When cut and polished, a jewel-quality black sapphire prevented time-related [[spells]] from operating within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. Spells such as ''[[temporal stasis]]'', ''[[time stop]]'', and spells from the arcane [[chronomancy]] school or divine [[time sphere]] all ceased functioning, either temporarily or permanently, depending on the nature of the spell. These gems could also be used in the creation of exceptionally powerful [[wand]]s that stored spells like ''[[darkness]]'' and related magics. The darkness effects produced were either more difficult for the target to resist or the strength of the spell increased, again, depending on the nature of the spell.

The [[shadow magic]] item ''[[helm of darkness]]'' used a large black sapphire and thirty-six [[black opal]]s in its construction.

==Price==
A typical specimen had a base market value of 5,000 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Black Sapphires==
* The ''[[Wyvern Crown of Cormyr]]'' was studded with jewels, including black sapphires.

==Notable Users==
* Black sapphires were considered prized gems among the [[drow]], being one of their favorites.
* The drow deity [[Vhaeraun]] sometimes showed his favor or disfavor with black sapphires.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}}
* The drow deity [[Lolth]] sometimes showed her favor to followers by having them discover black sapphires that had [[spider]]s encased in them. 
* Black sapphires were sacred to the [[Chult]]an demigod [[Eshowdow]], who also valued unholy items made of the material.<ref>
