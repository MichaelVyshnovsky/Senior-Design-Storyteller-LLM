Spells such as temporal stasis, time stop, and spells from the arcane chronomancy school or divine time sphere all ceased functioning, either temporarily or permanently, depending on the nature of the spell. These gems could also be used in the creation of exceptionally powerful wands that stored spells like darkness and related magics. The darkness effects produced were either more difficult for the target to resist or the strength of the spell increased, again, depending on the nature of the spell.
