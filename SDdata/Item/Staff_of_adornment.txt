A '''''staff of adornment''''' was a magical staff.

==Powers==
The staff looked like a regular mundane staff. What made it unique was that up to three objects could float above it. The objects could not weigh more than 1 pound (0.4 kilograms) each and floated an inch (2.5 centimeters) above the tip of the staff. The wielder of the staff could cause the objects to slowly rotate and spin. The objects remained floating until removed or the staff was no longer in the possession of the wielder.
