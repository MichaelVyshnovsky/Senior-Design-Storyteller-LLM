A '''''foldable chest''''' was an [[enchanted]] chest of drawers that was small and portable enough for an [[adventurer]] to carry. They could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Each drawer of the ''foldable chest'' contained an extra-dimensional (space similar to a ''[[bag of holding]]''), allowing the owner to not only carry but organize all of the supplies they needed for their plans.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Jarlaxle]], the legendary [[drow]] leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], owned several extra-dimensional storage spaces, including a ''foldable chest'', a ''[[bottomless pouch]]'', a ''bag of holding'', and a ''[[portable hole]]''.
