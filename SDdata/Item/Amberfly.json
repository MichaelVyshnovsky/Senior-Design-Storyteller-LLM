        "mainbody": "Amberfly was a citrus liquor distilled on the southwestern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars and sold throughout the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR.\nThe liquor had a slightly bitter taste due to being made using rinds of small citrus fruits that resembled oranges. Amberfly was typically bottled in vessels of opaque green glass.\nAmberfly was popular among the wealthy of Suzail in Cormyr, and merchants and traders on the Sword Coast, all along the Trade Way, and as far north as the city of Luskan."
