A darkskull was a powerful magical item that was wholly evil in nature.
They were carved entirely out of a single piece of ebony.
A darkskull emanated unholy energy and tainted everything within its vicinity.
It was possible for a darkskull to be redeemed. Upon this occurrence, silver holy symbols would appear upon its surface, and the  area around the skull would be marked as hallowed ground.
* Szass Tam, zulkir of necromancy and eventual regent of Thay.
