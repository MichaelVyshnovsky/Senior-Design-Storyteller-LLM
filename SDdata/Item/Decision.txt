'''''Decision''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[flaming]] [[falchion]] once wielded by General [[Anali Cyl]] of [[Neverwinter]] during the [[Luskan]]-Neverwinter war of [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
The falchion was an enchanted blade coated in magic flames. In addition to its ''+2'' enchantment, ''Decision'' dealt fire damage to its targets.

==History==
''Decision'' was the family heirloom blade belonging to a wealthy family of Neverwinter. When the Jewel of the North entered the war with its bitter rival neighbor Luskan in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, led by traitor [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], Anali's family attempted to ship her to [[Waterdeep]]. She was to be wed to a wealthy merchant family scion in the City of Splendors, away from Neverwinter. Anali much preferred to stand and die in defense of her home. She grabbed ''Decision'' off the wall and stormed off. As the war raged on, Anali Cyl became a famous General, wielding the family blade in battle.

By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, General Anali Cyl's falchion fell into the hands of [[Aldanon]], Sage of Neverwinter. The magic sword was stored in the basement of his manse in the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]].
