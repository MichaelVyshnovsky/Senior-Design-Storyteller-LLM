'''Dendritic crystal armor''' was heavy [[armor]] made by [[dwarves]] from dendritic seed crystals grown deep underground.

==Description==
It was not forged in fire and was tailored specifically to each wearer, leaving almost no gaps, but was heavier and more cumbersome than [[plate mail]].

==Powers==
The armor grew back to its original shape if damaged, provided there was at least 5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) remaining, in a maximum of eight hours. It could not be removed except by breaking one's way out.
