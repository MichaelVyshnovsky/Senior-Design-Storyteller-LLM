Dendritic crystal armor was heavy armor made by dwarves from dendritic seed crystals grown deep underground.
It was not forged in fire and was tailored specifically to each wearer, leaving almost no gaps, but was heavier and more cumbersome than plate mail.
The armor grew back to its original shape if damaged, provided there was at least 5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) remaining, in a maximum of eight hours. It could not be removed except by breaking ones way out.
