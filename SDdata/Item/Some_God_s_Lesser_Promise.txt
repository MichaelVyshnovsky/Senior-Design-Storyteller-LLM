Some Gods Lesser Promise was a unique and enigmatic enchanted short sword from the citadel of Seldarines Hand on the Spine of the World.
Some Gods Lesser Promise appeared to be a simple sword, basically a double-edged dagger with a blade of  and a pointed tip. The blades surface was etched with arcane symbols that radiated power.
This ordinary-looking blade possessed a +2 enchantment and upon a successful strike, it had a chance of dispensing small amount of magical healing onto its owner.
Most of Some Gods Lesser Promises remained a mystery. However, the sword first appeared in 1281 DR, when it could be found in the ruins of an ancient elven citadel of Seldarines Hand, more commonly known in that time period as the Severed Hand.
