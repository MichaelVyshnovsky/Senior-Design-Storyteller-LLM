'''''Some God's Lesser Promise''''' was a unique and enigmatic [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] from the citadel of [[Seldarine's Hand]] on the [[Spine of the World]].

==Description==
''Some God's Lesser Promise'' appeared to be a simple sword, basically a double-edged [[dagger]] with a blade of {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} and a pointed tip. The blade's surface was etched with arcane symbols that radiated power.

==Powers==
This ordinary-looking blade possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and upon a successful strike, it had a chance of dispensing small amount of magical healing onto its owner.

==History==
Most of ''Some God's Lesser Promise's'' remained a mystery. However, the sword first appeared in [[1281 DR]], when it could be found in the ruins of an ancient [[elf|elven]] citadel of Seldarine's Hand, more commonly known in that time period as the Severed Hand.
