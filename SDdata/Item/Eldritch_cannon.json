        "mainbody": "Eldritch cannons were a unique magical firearm utilized by artillerists.\nNovice artillerists utilized the tools of woodcarvers and smiths to craft spectacular and volatile variants of eldritch cannon.\nFunctioning as a type of magical ordnance, these were technological conduits of arcane energy that more–or–less resembled oversized firearms. They could deliver destruction in a variety of different ways. These magic-infused bombards varied in size and form, ranging from hand-held devices the size of a pistol to cannons the height of a goblin that had to rest on fabricated legs. In function, eldritch cannons could be made to spout a cone of flame, discharge bolts of force energy, or a blast of rejuvenating positive energy.\nThese cannons were highly customizable and could be hand-held in size, or mounted upon stands for additional stability. Types of eldritch cannons included\n* Flamethrower, which projected jets of flame outwards up to .\n* Force ballista, which shot out bolts of pure force energy to to a range of .\n* Protector, which released a pulse of positive energy that bolstered the life force of allies within a  radius.\nAs they continued throughout their careers, artillerists mastered the art of warfare utilizing their arcane cannons. They developed techniques to make their cannons more destructive, implemented self-destruction contingencies, and created fortified defenses of shimmering magical energy. Master artillerists were so adept at their craft that they could crew and maintain two arcane cannons at once."
