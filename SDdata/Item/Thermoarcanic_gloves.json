        "mainbody": "'''''Thermoarcanic gloves''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that accumulated and retained heat, endangering the wearer but also allowing them to discharge it in the form of a powerful magic attack.",
        "Description": "These [[leather]] gloves' fingertips were permanently stained with ash and darkened their seams.",
        "Powers": "While wearing a set of ''thermoarcanic gloves'' and landing a successful strike with fire-magic-powered weapons or hitting a target with flame-[[spell]]s, the wearer was able to accumulate heat within them. Once the internal heat of the gloves reached its maximum, they began to burn the hands of the wearer, but in exchange for this pain, they could use magical ''heat convergence'' to channel the accumulated heat into powering up their fire spells.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''thermoarcanic gloves'' belonged to [[Kansif]] of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], who was stationed within the dreaded [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] surrounding the [[Moonrise Towers]]."
