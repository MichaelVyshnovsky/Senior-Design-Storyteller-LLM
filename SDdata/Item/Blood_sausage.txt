'''Blood sausage''', or '''black pudding''', was a somewhat uncommon type of [[sausage]] found in [[Faerûn]].

==Availability==
In the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], now could find platters filled with an assortment of grilled, fried, baked, and boiled blood sausages, served with a ramekin of dipping sauce. These dishes were referred to as Black Pudding Platters.{{Cite digital book/Untold Adventures/Watchers at the Living Gate}}
