'''Chocolate''' was a bitter [[Maztica]]n beverage made of powdered [[cocoa]].

==Description==
Chocolate was brewed by mixing cocoa powder with [[water]]. It was considered a stimulating tonic that restored the drinker's energies.

==Availability==
* Maztican chocolate was available across the [[Sword Coast]]. It was particularly enjoyed among the wealthy inhabitants of [[Calimshan]], where it was usually consumed at small shops entirely dedicated to the beverage.
* In the city of [[Sigil]], a [[mage]] by the name of [[Quell (character)|Quell]] sold a variety of magical chocolates in the [[Civic Festhall]].<ref>

==History==
Chocolate was particularly enjoyed by [[chac]]s. It was common for a chac lair to contain large amounts of cocoa, which they used to brew the beverage.

==Reputation==
Chocolate was considered by some to be an aphrodisiac.

==Trivia==
The [[ethereal curtain]]s that connected the [[Ethereal plane]] with the [[Swamp of Oblivion]] were the color of chocolate.
