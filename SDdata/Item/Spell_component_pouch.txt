A spell component pouch, sometimes just called component pouch, was a small belt pouch in which spellcasters kept their commonly used material components and spell focuses for easy access.
These pouches were usually made of leather and were watertight. They often had separate compartments so that a spellcaster could find the item he or she needed in a matter of seconds.
