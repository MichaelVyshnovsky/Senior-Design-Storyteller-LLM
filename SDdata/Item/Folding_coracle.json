        "mainbody": "A '''''folding coracle''''' was a [[magic]]al [[coracle]], a boat favored by the [[Ffolk]] of [[Moonshae Isles|Moonshae]]. It was similar in general principle to a ''[[folding boat]]'', though not quite as impressive.",
        "Powers": "The ''folding coracle'' was a round boat of the \"skin and strut\" type ([[animal]] skin over a wooden framework). It measured 8 feet (2.4 meters) in diameter with enough room for six [[human]]-sized passengers. With a command word, it could be collapsed and folded down to a playing card-sized piece of leather for easy storage and concealment (it could even be sewn inside an article of clothing to further escape notice), or unfolded and enlarged again to form the coracle."
