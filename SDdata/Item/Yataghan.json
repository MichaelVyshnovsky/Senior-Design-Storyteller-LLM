        "mainbody": "The yataghan was a type of one-handed sword, closely related to the sabre.\nIt featured a broad blade with one edge, slightly curved inward.\nIt was made in a way that emphasized the natural movement in a slashing attack, while the weight of its somewhat broader front half made downward cuts especially effective. It could be wielded about as fast as a bastard sword when used one-handed.\nThe yataghan was in use in the lands of Kara-Tur, Zakhara,"
