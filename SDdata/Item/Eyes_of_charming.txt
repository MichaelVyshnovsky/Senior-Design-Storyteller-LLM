'''''Eyes of charming''''' were a set of [[magic]]al [[eyes]] that allowed the wearer to [[charm]] others.

==Description==
''Eyes of charming'' were a pair of crystal lenses (typically made of [[blue quartz]]) that fitted over the users' eyes. It was possible to wear only one of the eyes, instead of the pair, though this was far less effective.

==Powers==
These eyes stored three charges, and these charges would refresh at sunrise. When worn, the wearer could use a charge to ''[[charm person|charm another person]]'' that they could see, provided the other person was within {{SI|30|ft}}. However, it was possible for the target to avoid being charmed.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[lizardmen]] that inhabited the sixth level of the deep mines of [[New Verdigris]] had a set of ''eyes of charming'' amongst their stash of treasure.
