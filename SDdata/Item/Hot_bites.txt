'''Hot bites''' were a type of open-faced [[sandwich]] eaten as an appetizer, from the town of [[Hill's Edge]] in the [[Sunset Vale]].

==Description==
Hot bites were made out of pieces of sliced, or even stale [[bread]]. The bread was soaked in white [[wine]] and left to dry. Once the bread was dried, it was smeared in hot [[mustard]] and topped with [[cheese]] and [[onion]] or [[leek]]s. Lastly, the sandwiches were sprinkled with [[basil]], [[pepper]], drizzled with white wine, and fried on a skillet to melt the cheese. Hot bites were eaten hot.

==History==
Hot bites were served at [[The Happy Hippocampus Inn]] in Hill's Edge in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The hot bite was one of the foods that greatly impressed master traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] and received a glowing review in ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]]''. With the help of the inn's cook [[Alayss]], Volo was able to publish the dish's recipe in said guidebook.
