        "mainbody": "A '''music box''' was a mechanical device that played a tune via a winding mechanism or a turning handle.",
        "Description": "When activated, a music box produced sound through the vibration of tiny metal pegs plucked by a mechanism.",
        "Availability": "[[File:Gal.png|thumb|''A music box offered by the merchant, [[Galentha]]'']]\nMusic boxes were sold throughout the [[Eastern Heartlands]] by [[Firestorm|Firestorm House]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. They also occasionally saw trade at the [[Menzoberranzan]] bazaar.\n\nIn the [[Eileanar|Karsus Enclave]] of [[Netheril]], [[House Implement Wholesalers]] produced enchanted music boxes that were sold throughout the empire. The [[Behir's Nest]] in [[Khaerbaal]] was known for producing [[Music box (Halruaa)|Halruaan music boxes]].",
        "Notable Music Boxes": "* Enchanted music boxes from House Implement Wholesalers contained 40 songs and could record additional songs played nearby.\n* An enchanted jewel-encrusted music box was displayed within the chamber of the wizard [[Julius]] at the abbey of [[Deneir]] near [[Myth Drannor]].{{Cite dungeon/29/'Til Death Do Us Part|57}}\n* ''[[Wythyndle's Round Book]]'' briefly saw use as a music box after the wizard, [[Noustlas Mnarrath]], defenestrated the tome.\n* Halruaan music boxes were made from the teeth, bones, and entrails of [[behir]]s.\n* A [[pixie music box]] appeared to be an ordinary [[acorn]] shell. Once opened, the sound of [[pixie]]s singing would keep wild [[beast]]s at bay for six hours.\n* A [[music box of sobriety]] played a tune that could relieve intoxication in just one minute.\n* A music box within [[Shagambi's]] coffin was rigged to activate nearby [[terracotta]] [[Animated armor|warriors]] if the coffin was opened.\n* An enchanted pentagonal music box possessed by an [[arcanaloth]], [[Ygga Raxyg]], played with the sound of five different instruments, each corresponding to a side of the box.\n* A music box was attached to the [[book]] called ''[[Shemshime's Bedtime Rhyme]]'' and could implant a [[curse]]d rhyme in the listener's mind."
