        "Description": "''Boghurst's Putrefaction'' was a slender dagger with a longer than average blade.",
        "Powers": "''Boghurst's Putrefaction'' was a regular dagger that possessed the power to ''[[bestow curse]]'' on its targets. The dagger had seven charges of the curse. Another notable quality of the dagger was that it attracted [[undead]] creatures to its foul magics.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Boghurst's Putrefaction'' could be found in the deeper level of the Dwarven Dungeons, the [[Halls of Stone]]. The dagger's container attracted a small horde of restless undead over time. Dungeon delving adventurers needed to defeat a [[skeleton]] lord and its army of undead in order to retrieve the accursed item."
