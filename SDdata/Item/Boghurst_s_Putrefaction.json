        "mainbody": "Boghursts Putrefaction was an enchanted dagger found within the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor.\nBoghursts Putrefaction was a slender dagger with a longer than average blade.\nBoghursts Putrefaction was a regular dagger that possessed the power to bestow curse on its targets. The dagger had seven charges of the curse. Another notable quality of the dagger was that it attracted undead creatures to its foul magics.\nIn 1369 DR, Boghursts Putrefaction could be found in the deeper level of the Dwarven Dungeons, the Halls of Stone. The daggers container attracted a small horde of restless undead over time. Dungeon delving adventurers needed to defeat a skeleton lord and its army of undead in order to retrieve the accursed item."
