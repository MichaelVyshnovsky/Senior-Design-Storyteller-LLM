'''''Quinn's fancy sling''''' was a powerful enchanted [[sling]] that belonged to [[Quinn Silverfinger]] from [[Lonelywood]] of the [[Ten Towns]].

==Powers==
The sling was ensorcelled to make it significantly easier to hit is targets, similarly to that of a ''+5'' enchantment, with it's damage equal to that of a ''+3'' enchanted item.

==History==
Sometime before [[1281 DR]], this ''fancy sling'' was ''[[bless]]ed'' by Quinn Silverfinger's head priest from the [[Golden Spires]] in [[Amn]]. Proud of the honor, Quinn carried the weapon with him wherever he went. Over the years, he only got to use the enchanted sling three times. In 1281 DR, the sling was still in Quinn Silverfinger's possessions, stashed away in his chambers inside the [[Golden Lodge]], a small temple to [[Waukeen]] in Lonelywood, [[Icewind Dale]].
