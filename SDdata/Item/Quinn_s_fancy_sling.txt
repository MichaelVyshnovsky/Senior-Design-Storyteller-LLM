Quinns fancy sling was a powerful enchanted sling that belonged to Quinn Silverfinger from Lonelywood of the Ten Towns.
The sling was ensorcelled to make it significantly easier to hit is targets, similarly to that of a +5 enchantment, with its damage equal to that of a +3 enchanted item.
Sometime before 1281 DR, this fancy sling was blessed by Quinn Silverfingers head priest from the Golden Spires in Amn. Proud of the honor, Quinn carried the weapon with him wherever he went. Over the years, he only got to use the enchanted sling three times. In 1281 DR, the sling was still in Quinn Silverfingers possessions, stashed away in his chambers inside the Golden Lodge, a small temple to Waukeen in Lonelywood, Icewind Dale.
