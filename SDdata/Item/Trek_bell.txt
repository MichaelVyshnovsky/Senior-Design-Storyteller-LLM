A '''trek bell''' was a magical item of transportation.

==Description==
A ''trek bell'' was an immense dull [[iron]] sphere, large enough to hold four or five people. Runes covered the outside of the sphere. The entire bottom was open; per [[Neifion]], that was called a moon well.

==Powers==
A ''trek bell'' could protect those within from nearly any medium or environment. It could move through earth, stone, and water. However, it was possible to fall from the bottom.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1396}}, [[Neifion]] freed himself from his pact with [[Japheth Donard]] by swearing to bring him to [[Xxiphu]]. Neifion decided to do that by means of a ''trek bell'', which he had previously employed to visit the [[Fomorian]] court.{{cite book/City of Torment|84-85|8}}

The ''trek bell'' was lowered by an [[angel of exploration]] named [[Mapathious]], also bound by Neifion, across an extradimensional passage bound for Xxiphu. While inside the trek bell, Japheth was attacked by one of Neifion's homunculi, but the trip happened without further incident.{{cite book/City of Torment|124-128|12}}

The ''trek bell'' was dropped near a balcony of the city when Mapathious was attacked by [[Gethshemeth]], the [[kraken]]. Moments later, Neifion burst from the ''trek bell'', after his original pact with Japheth was broken by the destruction of its corresponding pact stone.{{cite book/City of Torment|165-168|15}}
