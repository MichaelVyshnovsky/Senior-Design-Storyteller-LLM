The '''''seal of invention''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] shard crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Coriolis Rillevay]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''seal'' was a small and sharp fragment of [[silver]] that Coriolis adopted as her [[spellcasting focus]]. She used it while crafting her clockwork sculptures, and marked the end of each project by using the ''seal'' either to carve her initials into the piece or to destroy it with a surge of ''[[wild magic]]''.

==Powers==
While using the ''seal of invention'', Coriolis was finely attuned to finding flaws in whatever she was working on, be it crafting a sculpture or fighting an enemy.

==Notable Owners==
* Coriolis Rillevay, a [[gnome]] [[sorcerer]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[wand of essential adaptation]]''.
