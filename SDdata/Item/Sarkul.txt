Sarkul was a type of a variety of smoked fish and one of the most favorite Tantran foods in the 15 century DR.
Sarkul was made using the fish from the Dragon Reach. The catch was beheaded, cleaned, gutted, and drenched in honey and local seasonings, before being hanged and smoked. The process of smoking took several days. The fish was cooked in enclosed smokehouses. The result was a savory food. Sarkul was never used as a filling for Tantran baeranth pies.
