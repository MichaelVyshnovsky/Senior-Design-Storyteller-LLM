'''Stilts''' were tools in the Realms popular among [[bard]]s and performers who stood on them to greatly increase their height during a performance.

==Description==
Stilts were usually made from wood and were avaible in various lengths.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold stilts for around 2 to 12 [[gold piece]]s per pair, depending upon their length.

==Notable Users==
* Stilts were favored by bards.
* The [[xvart]] [[shaman]]s of [[Raxivort]] often wore a specially designed set of stilts as part of their priestly vestments, elevating their height to {{SI|5|ft}}.<ref>{{Cite dragon/264/The Oeridian Lesser Gods|48}}
