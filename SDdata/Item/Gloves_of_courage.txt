'''''Gloves of courage''''' were a set of [[Enchantment|enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] that gave the wearer heightened fortitude and strength.

==Description==
Gloves of courage appeared as regal-looking intricately decorated gauntlets of violet color.

==Powers==
Once the gloves were put on, the wearer felt heightened emotions, increased fortitude, and was granted a slightly increased constitution.

Once a day the wearer could gain the effects of the ''[[bull's strength]]'' spell.

==History==
Before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], a pair of ''gloves of courage'' belonged to the last brewmaster of the city - [[Durlin]]. Before the dwarf perished in the [[Weeping War]], he stashed his magic gauntlets inside a barrel in the [[Halls of Light]]'s[[Chess (game)| chess]] room for his best friend [[Drake (person)|Drake]] to find. Later, in [[1369 DR]], the gloves were found by the heroes from [[Phlan]] with Durlin's ghostly help.
