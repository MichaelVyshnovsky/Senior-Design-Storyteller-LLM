Gloves of courage were a set of enchanted gauntlets that gave the wearer heightened fortitude and strength.
Gloves of courage appeared as regal-looking intricately decorated gauntlets of violet color.
Once the gloves were put on, the wearer felt heightened emotions, increased fortitude, and was granted a slightly increased constitution.
Once a day the wearer could gain the effects of the bulls strength spell.
Before the fall of Myth Drannor, a pair of gloves of courage belonged to the last brewmaster of the city - Durlin. Before the dwarf perished in the Weeping War, he stashed his magic gauntlets inside a barrel in the Halls of Lights chess room for his best friend Drake to find. Later, in 1369 DR, the gloves were found by the heroes from Phlan with Durlins ghostly help.
