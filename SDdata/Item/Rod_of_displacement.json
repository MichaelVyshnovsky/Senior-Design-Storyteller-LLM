        "mainbody": "The '''''rod of displacement''''' was a [[rod]] that granted various magical powers to its wielder.",
        "Abilities": "It functioned like a ''[[minor globe of displacement]]'' when held. It also allowed the wielder to use ''[[jump]]'' and ''[[knock]]'' twice per day each. Once a day, the wielder could create a sphere 5 feet (1.5 meters) in radius that would displace water and other mundane liquids like water, so it could be used to cross over rivers if shallow enough or even travel underwater if deep enough. The sphere constantly generated air for those inside, and expired after ten minutes.",
        "Availability": "''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the rod was worth 48,600 [[gold piece]]s.",
        "History": "This rod was invented when [[Myth Drannor]] was in its prime."
