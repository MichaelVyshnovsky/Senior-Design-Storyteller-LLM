        "mainbody": "A blanket was soft rug used to cover ones body in order to keep warm and comfortable.\nBlankets were made of comfortable material, such as wool. Some used their cloaks as blankets when journeying through cold locations or during winter, or to protect themselves from scorching sand. Furthermore, they could also be used to cool others down or drive off swarms of flying vermin. \nBlankets were used all over Faerûn,, Zakhara Specific types of blankets were sometimes placed between the saddle or the barding and a mount, in order to make the ride more comfortable, and to protect the mount.\nMagical blankets were known to exist throughout the multiverse.\nWhen Zhengyi the Witch-King plagued Vaasa, part of his citadel was occupied by a banshee. She covered herself in a blanket, and sobbed, drawing adventurers towards her as if she was an upset girl. The banshee aimed to spring unwary adventurers and attack them, should they approach her.\nThroughout the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz, one could set up a vending stall by simply placing a blanket on the ground.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold both single and double blankets made of flannel or wool.\n* Keshtin Pueblo, a Maztican village, was known for its embroidered blankets."
