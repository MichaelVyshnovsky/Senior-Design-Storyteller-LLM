        "mainbody": "Teukiir badges were magic items that could transport the wearer to the Silver Safeholdâ€”a strange demiplane created by Khelben Arunsun and the Sword Heralds.\nA teukiir badge was made from mithral and bore a mark depicting a rolled-up scroll sealed by a moon. The mark was set in white enamel and encircled by a dozen blue and white stars.\nThe magic of a teukiir badge could be used once per day and would only transport the wearer.\nAll members of the Tel Teukiira bore these badges."
