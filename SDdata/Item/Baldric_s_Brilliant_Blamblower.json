        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower was proudly displayed in the [[High House of Wonders]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] next to another famous deviceâ€”[[Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger]]. Both gadgets were considered an inspiration for young gnomish inventors. Young [[Purfbin Doogrick]] once attempted to create an invention he thought to be as grand as Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower. However, his [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]] caused shame and destruction in his family's burrow instead."
