The Circled Serpent was an artifact which could be used to open two portals. Both were located on the Chultan Peninsula. One portal lead to Smaragd, Sseths layer in the Abyss, the other to the lair of Dendar the Night Serpent on the Fugue Plane.
Arvin used the Circled Serpent to open the portal to Smaragd and destroyed the artifact after he had rescued Karrell and returned with her from that plane.
