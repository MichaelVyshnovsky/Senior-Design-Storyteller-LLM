'''''Chokemist''''', or '''Breath of Talona''', was the name of a subterranean plant and the toxic substance it produced, found in the jungles of [[Samarach]].

{{quote|''There is no way to withstand this [[poison]], no [[antidote]], little [[bird]]. It is called at times "Breath of [[Talona]]" because you die from it as surely as if she marked you. It is certainty- and perhaps a powerful mandate.''|[[Vadin'ya]], Merchant of [[Samargol]]}}

==Effects==
''Chokemist'' plants continually produced spore mist, an extremely poisonous substance with addictive properties which even affected those creatures naturally resistant to toxins. Small amounts of ''chokemist'', when inhaled, caused irrational behavior and delirium. Those who inhaled ''chokemist'' developed resistance to poison, allowing them to gather the substance. However, the resistance was accompanied by addiction. The dependency was so strong that creatures swiftly perished without regularly imbibing the spores. Entrances to the caverns filled with ''chokemist'' could be identified by green spore mists that rhythmically billowed from them.

''Chokemist'' was deadly. It had no antidote, no cure, and once inhaled, was virtually undetectable within the victim's body.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''chokemist'' plant was driven close to complete extinction in Samarach. Due to the fumes of the plant killing almost anything that caught a whiff of the substance. There were very few caverns in jungles where ''chokemist'' could be seen growing in the wild. One such [[Chokemist Cave|cave]] was to the north from the [[Snout of Omgar]].

In 1374 DR, [[Luaire Farwander]], a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] [[mage]] and infiltrator, used ''chokemist'' spores to poison a [[Lantan]]na [[artificer]]. Luaire commanded a small army of corrupted [[giant spider]]s, addicted to ''chokemist'' vapors and completely under his enthralling.
