Chokemist, or Breath of Talona, was the name of a subterranean plant and the toxic substance it produced, found in the jungles of Samarach.
Chokemist plants continually produced spore mist, an extremely poisonous substance with addictive properties which even affected those creatures naturally resistant to toxins. Small amounts of chokemist, when inhaled, caused irrational behavior and delirium. Those who inhaled chokemist developed resistance to poison, allowing them to gather the substance. However, the resistance was accompanied by addiction. The dependency was so strong that creatures swiftly perished without regularly imbibing the spores. Entrances to the caverns filled with chokemist could be identified by green spore mists that rhythmically billowed from them.
Chokemist was deadly. It had no antidote, no cure, and once inhaled, was virtually undetectable within the victims body.

There were very few caverns in jungles where chokemist could be seen growing in the wild. One such cave was to the north from the Snout of Omgar.
