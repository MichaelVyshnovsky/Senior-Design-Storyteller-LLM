'''''Spell fetishes''''' were the spellcasting implements used by the [[arcane]] and some [[divine]] spellcasters of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. In lieu of ''[[spellbook]]s'' and [[material component]]s that did not exist on the Plateau, [[wizard]]s used various effigies, totems, and trinkets to store the knowledge of the magic in.{{Cite living jungle/The Jungle Book of Malatra|46-47}}

==Description==
''Spell fetishes'' were as varied as the spells they contained, from pretty rocks to intricate carvings and poppets. Instead of pouring over their ''spellbooks,'' Malatran arcane casters nightly meditated over the selected ''fetishes'' to memorize their magical incantations and formulae. Divine magics were sometimes channeled through similar ''fetishes'' that could act like a divine focus â€“ a ''[[holy symbol]]'' crafted out of rocks, bones, skins, feathers and other jungle materials, or be more artistically complex carvings, consumed with use. Such divine fetishes could have a single use or a set number of casting and with each use, the fetish slowly decayed from the inside, eventually becoming fragile and crumbling to dust.

The [[Kukalatu]] tribe had a more unique approach to fetishes, of ''fi'' in the [[Kukalatu language]]. They exclusively used bones, teeth, and hair of the deceased tribe members, usually respected individuals or elders. The older the ancestral fetishes were, the more powerful they became.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty|14}}

Some fetishes required an olfactory component of meditation. Such charms as the ''[[stinking cloud]] spell fetish'', made of a broken shell of a rotten [[egg]], or the ''[[sleep]] spell fetish'' made with died [[nemuri]] within a [[gourd]], required the spellcaster to inhale the smells of the fetishes during their meditation.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Shadow Over Kuamu/Certificates}} Others required the caster to meditates on mental images and imagining of certain scenarios. For example, the ''[[enlarge]] spell fetish'' depicted a carving of a fat [[Nubari]] and while meditating, the casted needed to focus on the man's size and imagine how he came to be so large.

Some arcane spellcasters of the Living Jungle were able to tap into dark [[necromantic]] magics, despite generally spells of the school not functioning on the Malatran Plateau.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Lair of the Headshrinker|8}}
