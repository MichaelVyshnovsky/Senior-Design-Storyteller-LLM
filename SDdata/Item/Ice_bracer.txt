Ice bracers were unique pairs of enchanted bracers worn exclusively by specialty priests of Auril called chillbringers.
These bracers imparted physical protection on the chillbringer as if they were bracers of defense. Additionally, ice bracers behaved like a ring of warmth and protected the wearer from cold from both weather and magical cold-based attacks.
Ice bracers were made by high-ranking clergy of Auril during the Feast of the Moon using ice taken from the Great Glacier. The magic infusing the bracers allowed them to last until Greengrass.
