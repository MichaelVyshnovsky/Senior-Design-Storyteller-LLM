        "mainbody": "'''Feywine''' was an ancient type of [[wine]].",
        "Description": "Feywine was a fermented mixture of [[honey]], crushed flowers, and a secret ingredient. This ingredient was unknown to all races but for a few [[elves]], though some speculated that it was distilled moonbeams.\n\nWhen bottled away from fresh air, feywine would only last for a period of two days.",
        "Abilities": "Feywine was known to induce frivolous behavior when consumed. This effect was far stronger on non-elven races and consuming large quantities could cause a [[human]] to lose sense of themselves for months.",
        "History": "In [[1479 DR]], the festhall [[Moonstone Mask]] began serving feywine to its customers.",
        "Usage": "* [[Dwarves]] were generally known to disfavor the subtleties of feywine's flavor, thus they preferred to swill rather than drink it.\n* Feywine was widely considered to be the alcohol of choice for most elves. Typically it was reserved for elven festivals or celebrations of victories.\n* Elves often tried to keep other races, particularly humans, from consuming feywine as its effects could lead to further hostility towards them. [[Halfling]]s were one of the few exceptions to this.\n* [[Gnome]]s were known to have their own unique variation of feywine that they preferred over the elven variety."
