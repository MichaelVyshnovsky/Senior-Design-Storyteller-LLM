        "mainbody": "Feywine was an ancient type of wine.\nFeywine was a fermented mixture of honey, crushed flowers, and a secret ingredient. This ingredient was unknown to all races but for a few elves, though some speculated that it was distilled moonbeams.\nWhen bottled away from fresh air, feywine would only last for a period of two days.\nFeywine was known to induce frivolous behavior when consumed. This effect was far stronger on non-elven races and consuming large quantities could cause a human to lose sense of themselves for months.\nIn 1479 DR, the festhall Moonstone Mask began serving feywine to its customers.\n* Dwarves were generally known to disfavor the subtleties of feywines flavor, thus they preferred to swill rather than drink it.\n* Feywine was widely considered to be the alcohol of choice for most elves. Typically it was reserved for elven festivals or celebrations of victories.\n* Elves often tried to keep other races, particularly humans, from consuming feywine as its effects could lead to further hostility towards them. Halflings were one of the few exceptions to this.\n* Gnomes were known to have their own unique variation of feywine that they preferred over the elven variety."
