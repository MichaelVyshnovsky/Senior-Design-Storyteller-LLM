        "mainbody": "The '''''Fugue Machine''''' was a [[magic item]] that was powered by beings from the [[Fugue Plane]]. It was used by [[Red Wizards of Thay]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] to protect their fortress in the [[Thunder Peaks]].",
        "Description": "The ''Fugue Machine'' was a sphere made from [[crystal]] that was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} across encircled by spinning rings made from [[adamantine]]. The device was both magical and mechanical, and was built to contain a portal to the Fugue Plane. It siphoned beings from the Fugue Plane into itself, and converted their energy its power source. It was installed in the top of the tallest tower of the fortress, in a room with a domed roof made from [[glass]].",
        "Powers": "The ''Fugue Machine'' enveloped the fortress in a massive [[etherealness]] effect. The Red Wizards and their allies used the machine to enter into the [[ethereal plane]] at will. It was practically indestructible, and could only be damaged when attacked in the ethereal plane by [[magic]]al means.\n\nWhen damaged, the machine could produce a number of unpredictable and violent magical effects.",
        "History": "The ''Fugue Machine'' was created by a particular unnamed [[lich]] of the Red Wizards of Thay, who wore ''[[bracers of defense]]'' that were shaped like [[gloves|evening glove]]s and made from red [[satin]]. When the Red Wizards attempted to raise the [[dracolich]] [[Shargrailar]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Fugue Machine was employed to defend their fortress. It was operated by its creator and guarded by a number of dangerous creatures, including an [[ultroloth]] and multiple [[stone golem]]s."
