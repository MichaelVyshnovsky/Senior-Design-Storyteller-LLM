        "Powers": "The Black Quiver held but one [[magic]]al, black [[arrow]] within, which would be replenished immediately once drawn. Anyone struck by the arrow would suffer one of four unforgiving [[curse]]s. The target could be prevented from using magic for a day, paralyzed without recourse for perhaps an hour, slain outright, or even explode. However, every time one of its arrows was shot, the archer's hand blackened and stiffened permanently, reducing their dexterity."
