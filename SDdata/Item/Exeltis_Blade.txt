Exeltis Blade was the famous enchanted dagger that belonged to the Exeltis noble family from the Sword Coast North.
The blade possessed a +2 enchantment with its edge coated in magical poison that sapped the targets constitution when introduced into their bloodstream.
Couple of decades before 1372 DR, the Exeltis Blade belonged to Lord Exeltis of House Exeltis. On his deathbed, the just and fair nobleman entrusted the dagger to his young son, Feldran Exeltis. The Lord demanded a promise from his son, to defend his mother, Lady Exeltis, with his life. With years passing, Feldran Exeltis grew up to be a wild and cruel man. One night, the young Lord accompanying his aging mother, Lady Exeltis, on her late nights stroll along the beautiful Blade Cliffs. Feldran, evidently, forgot the promise he gave his dying father, and used the Exeltis Blade to cut his mothers life short. Feldran Exeltis became the new owner of Castle Exeltis following "accidental" death of his mother.
The young noble still carried the Exeltis Blade as of 1372 DR, when he attempted to kidnap and marry a young "princess" Soliana, thinking she was a rich heir to some distant kingdom.
