        "mainbody": "The '''''gems of endless variety''''' were a set of powerful [[enchanted]] [[jewelry]]. They could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The set included earrings and a hair cuff, all made of [[gold]] and set with a multiplicity of [[magical]] red [[gemstone]]s.",
        "Powers": "The ''gems of endless variety'' were associated with ''[[wild magic]]'' and were the essence of controlled chaos. In battle, they could be used to shape ''wild magic'' into beneficial spells, and could be used to bestow random boons on the wearer and their allies that made them generally more deadly and resilient. Outside of battle, they could be used to calibrate magical tools and create magical lights.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Coriolis Rillevay]], a [[gnome]] [[sorcerer]] and [[adventurer]] from Waterdeep, who used the ''gems of endless variety'' both in her career as an [[adventurer]] but also in her pursuits as a tinkerer and sculptor. She used the ''gems'' both to help her sculpt and to put on light shows around her finished pieces."
