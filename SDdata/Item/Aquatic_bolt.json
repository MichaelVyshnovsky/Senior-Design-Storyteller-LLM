        "mainbody": "quatic bolts were enchanted projectiles used by aquatic humanoids, sailors, and pirates of the Nelanther Isles and the Sea of Swords.\nThese bolts were designed and enchanted to be as deadly underwater as on the surface. When an aquatic bolt hit its target, the projectiles tip released a small but deadly burst of acid. Additionally, these bolts were especially effective against reptilian creatures.\nAquatic bolts were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale."
