        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of absorption''''' was a very rare type of magical [[rod]].",
        "Description": "The rod was typically yellow in color, with metal caps at each end. These were engraved with yellow runes.",
        "Abilities": "The rod enabled its user to absorb spells that targeted the bearer, cancelling the effects of the spell and absorbing the energy. This energy was converted inside the rod into power that could be used to cast spells the owner had in memory without expending the energy bound up in its memorization, preserving the caster's own power for later use. Any given rod could only absorb a certain amount of power, roughly enough to cast the most powerful spells five and a half times or so- and it could under absolutely no circumstances be recharged. The rod automatically communicated its total of absorbed, expended, and available energy to the one who grasped it.{{cite book/Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|133}}{{cite book/Dungeon Master Guide 2nd edition (revised)|204}}\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], the name was used to refer to rods that counted different properties, such as the ability to deactivate auras, and thwart incoming spell attacks. ''Rods of absorption'' were used back again in the more familiar way after the [[Second Sundering]], but they were no longer created with the ability to access the top half of spell tiers.\n\nThese rods had a slim, but dangerous, chance of slaying a [[nishruu]] immediately if taken into contact.{{cite book/Shadowdale: The Scouring of the Land|21}}\n\nFinally, they could be used to power spells in other worlds with less magic than [[Toril]], even if those worlds had magic too weak to truly support normal use of those spells.",
        "Construction": "One given example method for the construction of a ''rod of absorption'' involved burying a green shoot taken from an apple tree at harvest time with a topaz and the magic item most used by the creator inside a cedar box. Using a ''[[limited wish]]'', the topaz turned to dust and the item was ruined after a month, but the apple shoot was ready for enchantment. The final step of the enchantment involved the ashes of a vellum used as a scroll for an unknown spell.{{cite dragon/101/Charging isn't cheap|30}}",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1374}}, [[Fhaornik]] attempted to destroy a [[nishruu]] by throwing a ''rod of absorption'' at it, after the creature was released to attack [[Blackstaff Tower]]. His attempt was unsuccessful.{{cite book/Blackstaff/MMP|37|3}}",
        "Notable Owners": "[[File:Rod_of_Absorption.jpg|thumb|240px|''An activated ''rod of absorption'', firmly grasped.'']]\n* The [[Amlakkar]] of [[Calimport]] in the [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]].{{cite book/Calimport|57}}\n* The [[Akh'Faer]]n.\n* [[Waterdeep]] had some stashed for use by its city watch.\n* Monks of [[Candlekeep]]{{cite web/An Introduction to Candlekeep}}\n* [[Nhyris D'Hothek]]{{cite book/Skullport|88}}\n* [[Alustriel]]{{cite book/The Code of the Harpers|43}}\n* [[Sumulael]]{{cite book/The Complete Book of Necromancers|122}}\n* [[Trobriand]]{{cite book/The Ruins of Undermountain/Campaign Guide to Undermountain|108}}\n* [[Shinthala Deepcrest]]{{cite book/The Vilhon Reach/Dungeon Master's Reference|28}}\n* [[Iyraclea]]{{cite book/Epic Level Handbook|303}}\n* [[Mordenkainen]]{{cite book/Epic Level Handbook|309}}\n* The [[Oigur]] tribe of [[Tuigan]] warriors had a [[wizard]] who owned such a rod in {{yearlink|1357}}.\n* [[Vithal]], a [[mage]] that traveled the [[Cosmology|planes]] studying magic and accumulating wealth who became trapped within the [[Underdark]] some time during or before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n<!--* [[Mongrelle]]{{cite book/Under the Dark Fist|55}} Kinda far to call her Realmsian, but Vulkaran is.

        "Notable Rods of Absorption": "* The [[Lion Sword]] was assumed to work as one such rod per some sources.{{cite book/Villain's Lorebook|114}}\n* [[Asmodeus]] was said, in some early sources, to have such a rod.{{cite book/Monster Manual 1st edition|21}}\n* King [[Lhaeo]] possessed a unique version of this rod, the ''[[Monarch's Rod]]''.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Erlkazar and Folk of Intrigue|27}}\n* [[Imvaernarhro]]'s ''necklace of absorption'' functioned as such a rod did.{{cite book/Power of Faerûn|121}}"
