'''''Boots of Moander''''' were [[enchanted]] [[boots]] worn by the cultists of [[Moander]], the god of rot and decay.

==Description==
This magic footwear was made out of a patchwork of red and black [[leather]].

==Powers==
These boots possessed a simple enchantment that rendered the wearer immune to the ''[[entangle]]'' spell and similar magical effects.

==History==
Originally created by the cultists of Moander, several of these boots were in existence. Sometime before [[1281 DR]], a pair of these boots was used by the dark god's servants against deities of nature but eventually fell into the hands of [[Aldarra]] of [[Chauntea]] who passed them on to a friend of hers, a [[ranger]] named [[Liberton Twelvetrees]].

In 1281 DR, these boots ended up in the [[Temple of the Forgotten God]] on the [[Spine of the World]], a cult of [[druid]]s who stole the ''[[Heartstone Gem]]'' of [[Kuldahar]], claiming it as their holy relic.
