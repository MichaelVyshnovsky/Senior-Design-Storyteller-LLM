        "mainbody": "The Siege Malicious was a magical throne that determined the Oinoloth.\nAs mentioned above, the Siege Malicious was a throne. It was made from the same material as Khin-Oin was made from&mdashthe backbone of a deity. It was a large and immovable throne intended for superhumanly big people. It was so big that people who were smaller than intended for the throne looked especially ridiculous on it.\nIt was decorated with inlays of tarnished silver, base copper, and brass, as well as a crown of rubies at the top.\nThe Siege Malicious was used to determine the Oinoloth and give the prospective ruler of Khin-Oin full control over diseases on Oinos.\nThis was done by a prospective Oinoloth sitting on the throne. If the one sitting had killed the predecessor, the throne accepted him or her as the new Oinoloth but made their skin slough off. With the loss of skin came power over diseases on Oinos, namely the power to create, modify, or nullify any disease.\nWhen a person who did not qualify as the Oinoloth, for example a person who merely drove away but not killed the current Oinoloth, sat on the throne, the throne struck them with a particularly strong version of a disease called gray wasting that eroded the persons force of personality.\nAround 1357 DR, an arcanaloth called Yrkhetep tried to usurp Phraxass position and the Siege Malicious in a ploy that involved gaining control over the Vilhon Reach."
