        "History": "These magic blades were a local variant of [[kukri]] found in the city of Neverwinter. They were ordered by Calimshan Businessman's Embassy especially to be gifted to individuals who culturally represented the nation of [[Calimshan]] in the north. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these blades ended up on black markets and were sometimes available for purchase from dealers of magic arms and armor."
