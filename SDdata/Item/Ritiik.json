        "mainbody": "The ritiik was a member of the spear family of polearms, used in the polar regions of Toril, such as the Great Glacier.\nThe weapons were made of bone and measured  in length, In some lands, this weapon could sell for as much as 5 gold pieces.\nThe ritiik was designed for the purpose of attacking large animals found in cold environs, such as polar bears. Whenever the shaft of this weapon managed to pierce the flesh of a creature, the spear head would then be jerked backed so that its hook could dig into the flesh, potentially allowing for them to be dragged down to the ground.\n* Luftuk, an Iulutiun businessman in Lilinuk, carried a ritiik that he would lightly tap upon the ground whenever he wished to emphasize a point.\n* Najass, a master Iulutiun hunter, carried a ritiik.\n* Uhokkaki, a highly regarded warrior and pimataung of the Hupiik tribe, carried a ritiik.\n* The ritiik was predominantly used in the Great Glacier by the Iulutiun people, including the Angulutiun sub-group, being a common weapon among hunting parties.\n* Beyond the Iulutiuns, the weapon could be found in use by some neanderthals.\n* The ritiik was a common weapon of the priests and specialty priests of Ulutiu."
