'''Boccob's blessed book''' was a well-made and highly prized variety of [[spellbook]]s, named for the [[Oerth]]ian [[deity]] [[Boccob]].

==Description==
These books were quite durable and waterproof. They were bound with [[iron]] overlaid with [[silver]] and had locks. And they contained over a thousand pages.

A ''Boccob's blessed book'' was small in size, typically measuring {{SI|12|in|c|long=yes}} tall, {{SIrange|6|8|in|c|long=yes}} wide, and {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} thick. Though some were a mere {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}} in height.

==Powers==
Unlike a normal spellbook, ''Boccob's blessed book'' did not require the use of costly materials to inscribe [[spell]]s upon its pages.

==Crafting==
Creating one of these books required knowledge of how to craft wondrous items and the spell ''[[secret page]]''.

==History==
At some point prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an [[evil]] [[magic-user]] on [[Toril]] possessed one of these books and was slain in the caverns of [[Deepearth]] by [[demon]]s. Years later, a group of [[adventurer]]s would come across their mummified corpse and [[spectre]], retrieving from it the ''Boccob's blessed book''.
