        "mainbody": "'''''Grimjaw''''' was a seemingly plain, unadorned [[iron]] [[shield]] that in fact possessed a powerful protective [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]. It earned its name from a small inscription inside the top rim.",
        "Powers": "While it seemed to possess no magical properties, aside from being immune to rust, ''Grimjaw'' had devastating effects on any magical items with which it came in direct contact. It could drain charges from [[wand]]s or [[Staff|staves]], reflect attacks upon assailants, and negate and even completely drain, magical powers from other items or weapons.\n\nThese powers had no effects on [[artifact]]s, but could ''[[teleport]]'' them away upon touch.",
        "History": "The shield was first identified by the sage [[Ragefast]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], when brought to him by the adventurer, [[Krystus]]. Krystus carried it through his travels into the [[dwarven]] mines beneath the mountains near [[Tethyamar]], where he lost it, as well as his life, in a dispute. ''Grimjaw'' was in the possession of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] clan of the [[Iron House]] before being lost in their battle against [[orc]]s and [[wizard]]s.\n\nAfter those conflicts, the head of the Iron House, [[Ghellin]], sought to reclaim the enchanted shield."
