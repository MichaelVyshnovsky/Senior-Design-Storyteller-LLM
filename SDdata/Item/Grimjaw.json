        "mainbody": "rimjaw was a seemingly plain, unadorned iron shield that in fact possessed a powerful protective enchantment. It earned its name from a small inscription inside the top rim.\nWhile it seemed to possess no magical properties, aside from being immune to rust, Grimjaw had devastating effects on any magical items with which it came in direct contact. It could drain charges from wands or staves, reflect attacks upon assailants, and negate and even completely drain, magical powers from other items or weapons.\nThese powers had no effects on artifacts, but could teleport them away upon touch.\nThe shield was first identified by the sage Ragefast of Baldurs Gate, when brought to him by the adventurer, Krystus. Krystus carried it through his travels into the dwarven mines beneath the mountains near Tethyamar, where he lost it, as well as his life, in a dispute. Grimjaw was in the possession of the dwarven clan of the Iron House before being lost in their battle against orcs and wizards.\nAfter those conflicts, the head of the Iron House, Ghellin, sought to reclaim the enchanted shield."
