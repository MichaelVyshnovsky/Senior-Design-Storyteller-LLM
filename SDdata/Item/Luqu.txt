A '''luqu''' was a type of trident used by [[Angulutiun]] and [[Iulutiun]] hunters.

==Description==
A luqu was a slender trident, measuring at least {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} in length and about {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} in diameter. It was constructed by securing segments of bone or wood together with lashings. Each of the trident's tines was adorned with sharp, curved barbs. The luqu was specifically designed for spearing fish.
