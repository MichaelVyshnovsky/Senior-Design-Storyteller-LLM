        "mainbody": "A '''''horn of valor''''' was a [[magic item]] that boosted the morale of allies.",
        "Description": "This [[horn]] was made of [[gold]] but did not otherwise appear special.",
        "Powers": "When sounded, allies who heard the blast experienced a surge of morale and foes who heard the sound a lowering of their morale. Under normal weather conditions, the horn's magic was effective out to {{SI|8|yd|long=yes}}, and, even in a raging storm, the horn's magic would affect those within {{SI|3|yd|long=yes}}.\n\nThe horn would only function three times in a twelve-hour period; if accidentally sounded an additional time beyond that, it would lose it magical power for up to six days.",
        "Notable Owners": "At least one of the warriors who fought with the [[Moonlight Men]] against the [[orc]]s of the [[Nethertide Horde]] in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] bore one of these horns. It was buried with the warrior in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] in [[Turnstone Pass]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}"
