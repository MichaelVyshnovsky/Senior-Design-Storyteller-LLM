==Description==
These cloth [[cloak]]s were often dark brown or black in color.

==Powers==
A ''cloak of the bat'' made the wearer nearly invisible when the wearer was standing still within a dark or shadowy area. The wearer could also hang upside down, should the need strike them, from any ceiling. If the folds of the cloak were held at arm's length and flapped, the wearer could actually fly like a [[bat]]. The wearer could also transform themselves into an actual bat at will. Flight, either by flapping the cloak or while in bat form, could only occur under the cover of darkness and could be used for up to one hour at a time. The ''cloak of the bat'' needed an hour of recovery before granting the ability to fly again. Lastly, the cloak provided a degree of protection to the wearer from physical attacks, even while in bat form.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Pontar Elimon]], a [[sage]] from [[Arrabar]], wore a ''cloak of the bat''.
* [[Artemis Entreri]] the assassin wore a ''cloak of the bat'' briefly.<ref>
