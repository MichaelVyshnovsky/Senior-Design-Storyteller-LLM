        "mainbody": "A '''''staff of the serpent''''' was a [[magic item]] capable of transforming into a [[snake]].",
        "Powers": "Two versions of these magical staves exsitedâ€“the \"python\" and the \"adder\". The python version served as a potent [[quarterstaff]], making it easier for the bearer to strike and harm their enemies. If thrown to the ground the python version would grow to a {{SI|25|ft}} constrictor snake and attempt to grapple and suffocate the bearer's enemies.\n\nThe adder version also functioned as an enchanted melee weapon, but was not nearly as deadly as the python when used in this manner. However, the bearer could mentally command the head of the staff to become that of a venomous snake which would envenomate any target struck by the bearer with a lethal dose of venom.",
