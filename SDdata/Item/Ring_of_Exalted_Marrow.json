When someone looked through the rings loop, they could not see its other side â€“ there was nothing but blackness.\nThe wearer of the ring could tap into the exhort the risen enchantment once per day, which acted like the command undead spell. Another magic of the ring that could be activated once per day was its ghoulish touch when activated, it allowed the wearer to slash at their opponents with deadly necrotic ghoul claws that were capable of paralyzing the targets.\nIn the , the Ring of Exalted Marrow was stored in General Ketheric Thorms chest atop of the Moonrise Towers in the Western Heartlands."
