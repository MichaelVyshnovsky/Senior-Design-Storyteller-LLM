        "mainbody": "'''''Halaster's magnifying glass''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[lens]], imbued with powerful magics yet virtually useless, presumably created by the Mad Mage of [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]] himself.",
        "Powers": "This item was warm to the touch and was pulsing with powerful and almost palpable magic. Strangely enough, ''Halaster's magnifying glass'' did no actual magnifying and functionally offered no optic aid, and seemingly was completely useless. However, if used against insect creatures such as [[fomorian]]s, ''Halaster's magnifying glass'' was a surprisingly powerful implement of torture.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Halaster's magnifying glass'' could be found within the mega-dungeon underneath [[Waterdeep]] â€“ Undermountain, in possessions of a decrepitly old [[blue dragon]]."
