'''''Elixirs of the colossus''''' were [[magic]] [[potion]]s that temporarily increased the imbiber's size.

==Powers==
When one such potion was consumed, the imbiber's abdomen swelled and muscles steeled as their body grew in size. This ''[[enlarge]]d'' form possessed an impressively increased strength. However, the potion's effects faded if another elixir was consumed or the imbiber took a rest of at least eight hours.

==Creations==
One recipes for the ''elixir of the colossus'' required a mixture of [[salt]]s of [[chasm creeper]] to be mixed with a certain type of [[alchemical]] suspension.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Arron]], a [[halfling]] [[druid]] trader from the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
