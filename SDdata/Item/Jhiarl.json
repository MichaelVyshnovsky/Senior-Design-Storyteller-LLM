        "Personality": "It was claimed that ''Jhiarl'' chose its own wielder. When their need was great, a rogue water current would coil up and along their arm and finally solidify into a tapal, becoming ''Jhiarl''. However, it often possessed the wielder with its own evil intelligence.",
        "History": "It was much used in the fall of [[Aryselmalyr]], earning it its sobriquet."
