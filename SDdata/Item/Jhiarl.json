        "mainbody": "hiarl, also called the Emerald Tapal and Elfkiller was a magical sentient tapal, a traditional weapon of the tritons of Ser√¥s.\nIt was claimed that Jhiarl chose its own wielder. When their need was great, a rogue water current would coil up and along their arm and finally solidify into a tapal, becoming Jhiarl. However, it often possessed the wielder with its own evil intelligence.\nIt was much used in the fall of Aryselmalyr, earning it its sobriquet."
