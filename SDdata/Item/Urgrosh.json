        "mainbody": "An urgrosh, also known as a spear-axe, was an exotic two-handed melee weapon.\nUrgroshs were much like the dwarven waraxe, but with a longer haft. Longer even than a greataxe, but not so long as to be considered a pole arm. The gripping end of the haft was mounted with a spearhead.\nBecause of their two heads, the urgrosh could deal either slashing or piercing damage. The urgrosh was considered a double weapon that could be used as if fighting with two separate weapons provided it was wielded two-handed. If used one-handed, it was treated as either a shortspear or a battleaxe.\n* Khouryn Skulldark.\n* Dwarves were known to favor this weapon."
