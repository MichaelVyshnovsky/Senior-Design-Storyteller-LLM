        "Description": "Urgroshs were much like the [[dwarven waraxe]], but with a longer haft. Longer even than a [[greataxe]], but not so long as to be considered a [[pole arm]]. The gripping end of the haft was mounted with a spearhead.",
        "Weaponology": "Because of their two heads, the ''urgrosh'' could deal either slashing or piercing damage. The ''urgrosh'' was considered a double weapon that could be used as if fighting with two separate weapons provided it was wielded two-handed. If used one-handed, it was treated as either a [[shortspear]] or a [[battleaxe]].",
