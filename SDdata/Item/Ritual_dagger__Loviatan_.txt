'''''Ritual daggers''''' of the [[Loviatan]] faith were [[enchanted]] blades created to inflict pain and suffering on the willing and unwilling.

==Powers==
Loviatan ritual [[dagger]]s were decorated, sharp blades with their [[leather]] handles smothered by much use. These daggers possessed ''the Pain Maiden's blessing'' enchantments that boosted the wielder's ability to hit the target and increased their ability to withstand punishment after each successful slash against the target.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''ritual dagger'' was wielded by the torturer [[cleric]] of Loviatar named [[Abdirak]], who allied himself with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], interrigating the cult's prisoners in the [[Shattered Sanctum]], a ruined temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
