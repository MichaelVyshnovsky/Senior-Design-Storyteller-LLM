        "Powers": "When played, its strings emitted a soft [[bluelight|blue faerie fire]]. Its music had the ability to alleviate natural or magically induced negative emotions such as despair, fear, hopelessness, and rage, bringing relief within a short time. Moreover, any form of mental control or charm on creatures within hearing range was temporarily blocked, preventing the imposition of new influences, even if a bard attempted to use the harp for this purpose. The harp's maximum effective range was {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} in still air, although this increased up to {{SI|140|ft|long=yes}} downwind or when sound was transmitted through a cavity.",
        "History": "''Azlaer's harp'' originated from the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]]."
