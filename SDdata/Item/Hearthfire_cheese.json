        "mainbody": "The so-called '''Hearthfire cheese''', or simply '''Korontaun cheese''', was a variety of [[cheese]] made with the [[milk]] of [[korontaun]], or [[mountain korrun]] [[sheep]] native to the [[Giantspire Mountains|Giantspire]], [[Icerim Mountains|Icerim]], and [[Sunrise Mountains]], notably domesticated by the [[Nar]] [[human]]s.",
        "Description": "Hearthfire was a sharply-flavored cheese with a crumbly texture and a light [[amber]] color. It was often smoked alongside slabs of korontaun meat.",
        "History": "By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Korontaun cheese was produced everywhere these sheep were domesticated: [[Narfell]], [[Rashemen]], [[Thesk]], and in recent years, the [[Great Dale]] and [[Murghôm]]. The smoked variety of that cheese reached [[Impiltur]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR and quickly became a table staple in the areas where korontaun sheep were present."
