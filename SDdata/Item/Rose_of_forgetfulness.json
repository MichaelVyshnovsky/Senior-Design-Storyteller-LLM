        "mainbody": "A '''''rose of forgetfulness''''' was a dangerous enchanted flower found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Powers": "Inhaling the aroma of these flowers caused forgetfulness and memory loss. If a [[wizard]] or spellcaster inhaled this aroma they would forget a memorized [[spell]] for every minute they lingered near the flower. To make matters worse, the wizard did not realize the spell was lost until they attempted to cast it.\n\nAnyone unlucky enough to inhale directly from a ''rose of forgetfulness'' would experience complete amnesia–forgetting their identity and losing any previously learned skills or abilities.\n\nBoth the amnesia and other memory loss was permanent unless cured by a ''[[wish]]'', ''[[heal]]'', or ''[[restoration]]'' spell.\n\nA ''rose of forgetfulness'' would retain its dangerous properties for 1–6 weeks after being cut from its bush."
