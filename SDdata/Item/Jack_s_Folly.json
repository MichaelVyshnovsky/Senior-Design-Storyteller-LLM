        "mainbody": "'''''Jack's Folly''''' was a pair of old and weathered [[leather]] [[boots]] that once belonged to a would-be treasure seeker named [[Jack Corvet]].",
        "Powers": "The boots' humble appearance hid their magic well. Once per day upon command, ''Jack's Folly'' unleashed the ''[[enlarge person]]'' spell.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Jack Corvet attempted a daring robbery of a [[cloud giant]]. He claimed the giant's golden [[chicken]], but his stealth failed the adventurer, and the giant quickly gained on Jack. The adventurer whispered a wish upon a lucky [[ring]] inherited from his grandmother. To everyone's surprise, Jack grew in size, big enough to be able to punch the giant out and flee with the precious poultry treasure. When the chicken laid a golden [[egg]], Jack sold it and, with the money, replaced his old raggedy pair of boots.\n\nLater, Jack Corvet attempted the robbery again, but the \"magic\" ring did nothing this time. Jack did not survive the burglary. Such was the story of ''Jack's Folly'' as true magic was hidden within his old boots. By 1374 DR, the boots found their way into the collection of [[Mintassan the Magnificent]], proprietor of [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]]."
