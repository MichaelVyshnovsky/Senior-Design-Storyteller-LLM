        "mainbody": "uiche was a type of small savory open-faced hand-tart handfood from northwest Faer√ªn and the city of Neverwinter.\nNeveren quiches were pies typically filled with cheese, spinach, and mushrooms. They could be consumed hot as well as cold. Elminsters favorite variety was made with yellow cheese and meat. During some of his trips to Earth and Ed Greenwoods home, Elminster partook in a variety of Earths mass-produced quiches, which he didnt care for, and once he even made quiche with a mysterious local meat called \"spam.\"\nTupidratkreas summon quiche spell had some relation to the tarts, presumably summoning them via magic."
