        "mainbody": "mooncloak was a magical cloak used by the church of Selûne that protected the wearer and let them walk on air and water alike.\nIt was a cloak of silvery gray color that weighed 1 pound (0.45 kilograms).\nAfter the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, it was considered a cloak of protection +1 that granted use of the spells water walk and levitate as the wearer willed. After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, it functioned as a cloak of resistance of variable strength, with water walk and levitate each usable only once a day.\nMooncloaks were most often created by an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess Selûne was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy. Nevertheless, by 1372 DR, other spellcasters had discovered how to replicate them. This required the levitate and water walk spells in addition to resistance.\nPrices ranged from 9,000 to 34,800 gold pieces, depending on the amount of protection bestowed."
