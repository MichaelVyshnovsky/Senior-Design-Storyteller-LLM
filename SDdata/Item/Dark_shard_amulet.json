        "mainbody": "A '''''dark shard amulet''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[amulet]] used by [[warlock]]s to tap into some of the power of their [[:category:Warlock patrons|patrons]].",
        "Description": "A typical ''dark shard amulet'' was made from a fragment of resilient material that originated in the native [[plane]] of the warlock's patron.",
        "Powers": "While attuned to the amulet and wearing it, a warlock could use it as a [[spellcasting focus]] to cast [[spell]]s. In addition, once per day, the wearer could invoke the power of the amulet to cast any [[:Category:0th-level warlock spells (5e)|warlock cantrip]] that was unknown to the caster. Success was not guaranteed, though, as it depended on the warlock's understanding of the [[Arcane magic|arcane]] forces at work for the amulet to operate."
