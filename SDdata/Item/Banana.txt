A banana was a fruit that was grown on palm trees around Faerûn and Zakhara.
The inner flesh of these yellow fruits was eaten, whilst the peel was usually regarded as waste.
A wizard conjures banana peels to trip a barbarian.
The halflings of Luiren were known cultivators of bananas and grew bananas between Beluir and Chethel. They usually consumed them, but sometimes exported them to places such as Halruaa and Durpar, who were keen on green bananas. A few places in Chult, particularly the Agricultural Quarter of Mezro, contained banana plantations.
Bananas hang from the ceiling of a Waterdhavian produce merchants stall.
Bananas were consumed by many races such as humans and halflings, The ashira, tree spirits of Zakhara, lived in banana trees (as well as trees bearing other fruits) and survived off of the bananas they produced. 
The peel of these fruits was one of the material components required to cast Caddelyns catastrophe.
Bananas were known to be fried for consumption, originating the saying "fried like a banana." Halflings from South Faerûn used bananas to flavor certain liqueurs and produced candied bananas to be shipped to their northern brethren.
