A '''banana''' was a fruit that was grown on [[palm|palm trees]] around [[Faerûn]] and [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
The inner flesh of these yellow fruits was eaten, whilst the peel was usually regarded as waste.

==Cultivation==

The [[halfling]]s of [[Luiren]] were known cultivators of bananas and grew bananas between [[Beluir]] and [[Chethel]]. They usually consumed them, but sometimes exported them to places such as [[Halruaa]] and [[Durpar]], who were keen on green bananas. A few places in [[Chult]], particularly the Agricultural Quarter of [[Mezro]], contained banana plantations.

==Usages==

Bananas were consumed by many races such as [[human]]s and [[halfling]]s, The [[ashira]], tree spirits of [[Zakhara]], lived in banana trees (as well as trees bearing other fruits) and survived off of the bananas they produced. 

The peel of these fruits was one of the [[material component]]s required to cast ''[[Caddelyn's catastrophe]]''.

Bananas were known to be fried for consumption, originating the saying "fried like a banana." [[Halflings]] from [[South Faerûn]] used bananas to flavor certain liqueurs and produced candied bananas to be shipped to their northern brethren.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-15/Bananas in halfling cuisine}}

==Trivia==
* There was a racing [[hadrosaurus]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]] known as [[Banana Candy]].
* A druid, who lurked within a cave in the deep forests of Chult, was known as the "banana man".
