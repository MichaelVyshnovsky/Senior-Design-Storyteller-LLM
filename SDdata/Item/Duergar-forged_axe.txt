'''''Duergar-Forged Axes''''' were huge perfectly-balanced [[enchanted]] [[battle axe]]s of dull gray [[steel]], forged and ensorcelled by the [[duergar]] [[dwarves]] underneath the [[Spine of the World]].

==Powers==
The sharpness of these dangerous axes was evident that the duergar smiths used magic in their creation. ''Duergar-forged axes'' possessed ''+1'' enchantments to the weapons' aim and damage, while their ''[[keen]]'' blades were ready to cleave the opponents.

==History==
In {{YearlinkName|1312}}, one such ax belonged to [[Barud Barzam]], a duergar leader who was in charge of an underground outpost in the [[River Caves]], where the [[Black Raven River]] spills from under the [[Spine of the World]]. Barud offered his ''duergar-forged axe'' to anyone willing to descend into the lower caverns underneath the outpost to exterminate [[hook horror]]s and [[mustard jellies]] who infested the area.
