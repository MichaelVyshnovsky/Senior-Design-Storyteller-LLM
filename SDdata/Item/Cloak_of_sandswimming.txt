'''''Cloaks of sandswimming''''' were a variety of [[magic]]al [[cloak]]s that aided their wearer in traversing [[sand]].

==Description==
These slick cloaks were made of [[satin]] and were rust-red in coloration.

==Powers==
Those who wore a ''cloak of sandswimming'' could effortlessly swim through sand as if it were water and could even breathe in sand at no detriment to themselves.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], a group of [[priest]]s of [[Tiamat]] living within the [[Altar of Scales]] (a secret temple in the undercity of [[Unthalass]]) kept one of these cloaks in their treasury.
