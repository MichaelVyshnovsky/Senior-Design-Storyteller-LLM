        "mainbody": "Boots of starstriding were enchanted boots used by wildspace-farers and corsairs.\nBoots of starstriding were ensorcelled to keep their wearers solidly within the gravity plane of any spelljammer, preventing them from floating away weightlessly. The boots allowed the wearer to leap from one gravity plane to another, and from one ship to another, without oscillating, despite being magically slowed down in the process. The success of such jumps depended only on the wearers athleticism and jumping proficiency.\n*Gamalon Idogyr, the most powerful wizard in Bral in the mid–14 century DR.\n*Shalandain, a crusader member of Company of the Chalice based out of the Rock of Bral in the mid–14 century DR, who won a pair of boots of starstriding from a scro."
