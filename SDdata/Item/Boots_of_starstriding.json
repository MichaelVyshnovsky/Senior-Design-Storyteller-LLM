        "Powers": "''Boots of starstriding'' were ensorcelled to keep their wearers solidly within the gravity plane of any ''[[spelljammer]]'', preventing them from floating away weightlessly. The boots allowed the wearer to leap from one gravity plane to another, and from one ship to another, without oscillating, despite being magically slowed down in the process. The success of such jumps depended only on the wearer's athleticism and jumping proficiency.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Gamalon Idogyr]], the most powerful [[wizard]] in [[Bral]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*[[Shalandain]], a [[crusader]] member of [[Company of the Chalice]] based out of the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR, who won a pair of ''boots of starstriding'' from a [[scro]]."
