A '''halberd''' ({{Pronounce|HAL|berd|refs={{Cite web/Dungeons & Dragons FAQ}}}}) was a widely used member of the poleaxe family of [[polearm]]s, that could best be described as somewhat of a cross between an [[axe]] and a [[spear]].

==Description==
The business end of a halberd consisted of three parts: the axe-head, the back spike or "fluke", and the spear tip that surmounted it. While many polearms had a similar structure, halberds had a few distinguishing features. Their axe-heads were concave (curving inward) to nearly straight, instead of convex like most axes. And were set at an angle to the shaft, instead of being mounted perpendicular.

The fluke of a halberd, which was fairly short and angled slightly downward, helped to balance the weapon. It was sometimes replaced by a hook for dismounting cavalry. The sharp spear-like spike that surmounted the fluke was usually of quadrangular design, but varied in length and size. Some were long and slender, while others were broader and of a medium length.

The average halberd measured {{SIrange|6|8|ft|long=yes}} in length, or longer with their spear tips.

==Weaponology==
Halberds were extremely versatile against a wide range of opponents due to ability to unleash slashing, thrusting, tripping, or dismounting attacks. Dismounting in particular was a main function of the weapon. And were quite effective against [[plate armor]]. However, due to their size halberds were rather slow, unwieldy, and often considered detrimental in close quarters combat. 

Halberdiers could attack the flanks of a pike formation with great effect, due to pikemen being unable to bring their much longer weapons to bear in close combat.

==Availability==
Business and merchants in the Realms where one could purchase halberds from included:
* A number of merchants in [[Athkatla]]'s market [[Waukeen's Promenade]] commonly sold halberds, including the fruit merchant [[Enge]] and [[Ribald Barterman]] from his store [[Adventurer Mart]]. In the [[Athkatla/Bridge District|Bridge]] district, one could find them for sale from the innkeeper of [[Delosar's Inn]] and at the street-side stall of [[Bel Dalemark]].

==History==
Halberds first became available in the [[Netheril|Netheril Empire]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2584|NY}}.

Around [[1372 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] were smuggling halberds into [[Daggerford]] with the frigate [[Barracuda (ship)|''Barracuda'']].

Prior to [[1371 DR]], the average halberd cost 10 [[gp]] and weighed {{SI|15|lb}}. After 1371 DR, and up to the [[Spellplague]], the price of halberds remained the same, but weighed {{SI|12|lb}}.
