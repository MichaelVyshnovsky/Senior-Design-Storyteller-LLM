Hyaline was a milky or white form of quartz
The milkiness of these ornamental stones was caused by tiny droplets of water or carbon dioxide trapped in the crystals. Some specimens contained flecks of gold.
Hyaline was sensitive to magic and would give off a blue glow whenever magic was activated, triggered, cast, or passed within 20 feet (6.1 meters) of a hyaline gem.
