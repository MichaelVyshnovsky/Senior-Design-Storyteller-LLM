The name \"crested helmet\" is taken from the historical campaign sourcebook ''Age of Heroes'', though due to the genericness of such a name it should not be assumed that any mention of a \"crested helmet\" in the Realms is referring to this style of helmet.",

As part of this nefarious plan he was developing a new form of [[siege engine]], known as [[inferno bombard]]s.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Iron Baron|4-5}} The entrance to the [[Molten Vault]] where they were being developed was guarded by a large contingent of goblinoids, with the [[hobgoblin]]s all outfitted in blackened [[steel]] armor and crested helmets.{{Cite adventurers league/The Iron Baron|8}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"hoplite\">As the hobgoblins in this adventure are described as wearing \"armor resembling hoplites\", it is assumed that the style of helmet described in the adventure is likewise referring to a Corinthian helmet."
