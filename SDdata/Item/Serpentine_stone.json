        "Powers": "This stone was used for in the creation of the [[figurine of wondrous power]] known as the ''serpentine owl''. Certain varieties of this mineral shared the same protective properties as the gem-quality [[serpentine]], i.e., it granted a one-time boon of a ''[[resist fire]]'' and a ''[[resist cold]]'' spell, disintegrating to dust after reacting to one each of extreme cold and extreme heat. Only skilled jewelers, miners, and spellcasters with experience working with this stone could determine if a particular sample had this magical property or not."
