        "mainbody": "The belt of wisdom was a powerful magical belt that could be found in the Realms circa the late 15 century DR.\nThe belt was decorated with a series of owl feathers along its form. The buckle was rather plain in appearance, but smoothed out like a textless scroll.\nIt greatly bolstered the mental capacity of the wearer so they could attain greater understanding and perspective on issues they faced.\nAlong with the Cloak of the Protector, this belt was part of a set of powerful artifacts referred to as the \"Great Protector\"."
