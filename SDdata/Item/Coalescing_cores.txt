The '''''coalescing cores''''' was a set of odd objects orbiting each other that was crafted and [[enchanted]] by [[Coriolis Rillevay]] for use in battle. It could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''coalescing cores'' hovered just above the wielder's head, and could be commanded to hurl themselves at their enemies, although the wielder was only able to choose the first target and the ''cores'' seemed to choose whether to attack multiple targets.

==Notable Owners==
