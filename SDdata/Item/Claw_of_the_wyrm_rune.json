        "Powers": "Three times a day, wielders of this claw could point it at any dragon within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of them and those of weak will would be rendered temporarily vulnerable to all forms of damage. The claw also granted its bearers a resistance to the breath weapon of any dragon.\n\nAdditionally, the wielder could permanently affix the claw's magic to an area by drawing a ''wyrm'' rune in the desired location. The process was lengthy, taking up to eight hours, and required the claw to be within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} of the rune. Once complete, the claw would be shattered beyond repair and any dragons that wandered within {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} of the rune would feel a heavy weight forcing them to fly no higher than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}."
