'''''Glowing globes''''' were [[magic item]]s that floated near the wielder and provided a source of light.<ref name=DM.41-p30">{{Cite dragon/41/Bazaar of the Bizarre|30}}

==Powers==
These globes always floated over the shoulder of the one who touched them. Their brightness was under the mental control of the wielder. A ''glowing globe'' would continue to follow one person until touched by someone else. A small percentage of these items were always illuminated regardless of the wielder's desires.<ref name=DM.41-p30"/>

==History==
These items were created by the [[wizard]] [[Nchaser]], a native of [[Luskan]].
