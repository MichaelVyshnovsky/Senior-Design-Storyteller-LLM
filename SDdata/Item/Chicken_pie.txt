Chicken pie was one of the several simple types of poultry pies consumed in South Faer√ªn.
The Drovers Last Drink tavern in the Tethyrean town of Mosstone served handfood pies popular among those leaving the town. For those willing to sit down, bigger versions were served in a bowl with a set of utensils. Chicken pies, pheasant pies, and quail pies served there were all perfectly and uniformly shaped and had appetizing golden crust. When they were served in bowls, pies exploded with rich brown mushroom gravy once cut into.
Chicken pies were a common treat in the Blade Kingdoms and the city-state of Sumbria. While in Sembia, chicken pies were served accompanied by traditional hot Sembian black tea.
