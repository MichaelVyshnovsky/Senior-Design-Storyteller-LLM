'''Chicken pie''' was one of the several simple types of poultry pies consumed in [[South Faerûn]].

==Availability==
The [[Drover's Last Drink]] tavern in the [[Tethyr]]ean town of [[Mosstone]] served handfood pies popular among those leaving the town. For those willing to sit down, bigger versions were served in a bowl with a set of utensils. Chicken pies, [[pheasant pie]]s, and [[quail pie]]s served there were all perfectly and uniformly shaped and had appetizing golden crust. When they were served in bowls, pies exploded with rich brown [[mushroom]] [[gravy]] once cut into.

Chicken pies were a common treat in the [[Blade Kingdoms]] and the city-state of [[Sumbria]]. While in [[Sembia]], chicken pies were served accompanied by traditional hot Sembian [[black tea]].
