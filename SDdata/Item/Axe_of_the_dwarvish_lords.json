        "mainbody": "An '''''axe of the dwarvish lords''''' was a [[enchanted]] [[axe]] that likely fell into the possession of several [[adventurer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The axe blade was made from some steel-like metal and had runes engraved on it. The [[weapon]]'s shaft was made from a similar material and had a precious stone inserted into it. The axe's handle was considered short and in general the item was described as shiny.",
        "Powers": "It allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''axes of the dwarvish lords'' could be found in [[Neverwinter]], [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Mount Hotenow]], and [[Neverwinter Wood]]. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such weapons were likely found by the adventurers that stopped [[Deathsleep]], the [[green dragon]]."
