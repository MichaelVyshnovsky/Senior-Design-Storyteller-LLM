        "mainbody": "n axe of the dwarvish lords was a enchanted axe that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.\nThe axe blade was made from some steel-like metal and had runes engraved on it. The weapons shaft was made from a similar material and had a precious stone inserted into it. The axes handle was considered short and in general the item was described as shiny.\nIt allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\nIn the late 15 century DR, axes of the dwarvish lords could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such weapons were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon."
