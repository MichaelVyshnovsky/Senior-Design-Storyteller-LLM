        "mainbody": "A zaithisk was a device used by the githyanki to treat ceremorphosis.\nA zaithisk was a partly organic, partly mechanical githyanki device that was an ingenious synthesis of illithid anatomy and metal alloys. It hummed with psionic energy, hinting at paths into unknown minds and unseen planes.\nIt purportedly purified a mind flayer tadpole from an infected victim. When activated, psionic forces battered the victim. The device targeted the tadpole but its approach was haphazard. Without precise control, it could inflict lasting harm on the victims mental faculties.\nHowever, the devices curative properties were a lie fed to the githyanki. In truth, the device was lethal and its purpose was to harvest the mind and memory of the infected githyanki, and ending their lives.\nGhustil Stornugoss, a githyanki scholar and physician, operated a zaithisk in Cr√®che Yllek."
