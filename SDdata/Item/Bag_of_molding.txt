'''''Bags of molding''''' were magic containers with seemingly useless [[enchantment]]s woven into them.

==Powers==
These bags' enchantments caused all food placed inside to grow mold and spoil immediately.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''bag of molding'' was displayed among splendorous enchanted rewards for those willing to partake in [[Akabi]]'s Wheel of Fortune game in the [[Circus of the Last Days]] during its stay in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]].
