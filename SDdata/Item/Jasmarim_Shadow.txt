Jasmarim Shadow was a legendary brand of wine created by a long-gone moon elf vintner of the Vintners Keep. The Jasmarim wine was highly sought after in the late 15 century DR.
Jasmarim Shadow was an extremely rare, red wine.
In late 15 century DR, Jasmarim Shadow went for a steep sum of money and was out of production for centuries. All Jasmarim came from one moon elf winemaker who knew how to do only one thing and did it well. He produced his wines from his Vitners Keep, at the southern border of Lurkwood. His wine was made in limited quantities and small batches, and was reserved for the most exclusive galas and events.
A cook from Luskans own Cutlass inn, circa the , was searching for a bottle of the exquisite libation to experiment with to improve in his culinary skills and to win cooking competitions. He hired the Champion of the Burning Dawn and their companion to retrieve some of the legendary wine from the Vintners Keep.
