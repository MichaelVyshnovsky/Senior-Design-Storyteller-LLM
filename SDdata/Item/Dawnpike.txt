Dawnpike was an ancient elven enchanted spear created to be effective against the undead and drow.
Dawnpike was a beautifully crafted golden polearm.
Dawnpike was a powerful magical weapon that could cast the searing light spell. It possessed a +4 enchantment and it was even more powerful, reaching +6, when used against creatures that were sensitive to light, such as drow and the undead.
The wielder of this pike also gained enhanced reflexes and will, but reduced defense against spells and abilities that affected the targets fortitude.
In 1369 DR, Dawnpike was already an ancient weapon, buried deep inside the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor. It was excavated by the drow of House Freth and packed away to be transported to Underdark along with other ancient even magical items they found in the dungeons of the City of Song.
