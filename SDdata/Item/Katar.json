        "mainbody": "A katar was a punching dagger common to Calimshan and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThe word for \"knife\" in Alzhedo was katar, yet when most people used the term \"katar\", they were referring specifically to the punching dagger used by Calishites.\nA katar was a dagger with an H-shaped handle, perpendicular to the length of the triangular blade.\nKatars were held in a clenched fist, facing away from a users knuckles, and typically used for either stabbing or slashing an opponent. However, the former was the more common method among its users. It put more force from ones punch behind it, making it capable of deadly attacks.\nA punching dagger was the favored weapon of clerics of the Mulhorandi goddess Isis.\nKatars were one of the traditional weapons of the dragonborn."
