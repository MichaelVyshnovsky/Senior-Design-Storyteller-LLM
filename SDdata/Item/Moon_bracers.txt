Moon bracers were a set of magical defensive bracers used by the church of Selûne that gave the power to cast dimension door.
They were adorned with mother of pearl and weighed 1 pound (0.45 kilograms).
These bracers functioned like the typical bracers of defense or later bracers of armor, but permitted the wearer to use dimension door once in a 24-hour period. After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, this was limited to once a night and only between moonlit locations, but after the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, there were no such restrictions.
Moon bracers were most often created by an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess Selûne was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy. Nevertheless, by 1372 DR, other spellcasters had discovered how to replicate them. This required the dimension door spell in addition to mage armor.
Prices ranged from 12,100 to 84,160 gold pieces, depending on the amount of protection bestowed.
