Elixirs of half-orcish fury were potions created through sanguinous magic arts by Araj Oblodra of Crimson Draughts in the late 15 century DR.
Elixirs of half-orcish fury were distilled from the blood of half-orcs, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with half-orcish fury – the ability to be relentless in battle and remain standing even after suffering the gravest of injuries. This blood-bound magic was expended after one day.
In the , Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of half-orcs infected with the illithid tadpoles of the Cult of the Absolute to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in Moonrise Towers. After the death of Ketheric Thorm, she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of Baldurs Gate, where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments.
