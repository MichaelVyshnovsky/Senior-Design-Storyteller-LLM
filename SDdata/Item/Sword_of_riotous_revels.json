        "mainbody": "The '''''sword of riotous revels''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[longsword]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Calliope]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Powers": "The properties of the ''sword of riotous revels'' were directly inspired by Calliope's gift for celebration. The weapon was a ''[[dancing sword]]'' capable of flying out and inflicting grievous harm by transferring life essence from it's target to Calliope or one of her allies. This transfer of life essence left her allies with a sense that Calliope had shared her joy with them.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Calliope, a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] and former pirate, to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[seal of orchestration]]''."
