        "mainbody": "The sword of riotous revels was a unique enchanted longsword crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Calliope in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nThe properties of the sword of riotous revels were directly inspired by Calliopes gift for celebration. The weapon was a dancing sword capable of flying out and inflicting grievous harm by transferring life essence from its target to Calliope or one of her allies. This transfer of life essence left her allies with a sense that Calliope had shared her joy with them.\n* Calliope, a half-elf bard and former pirate, to whom Silverhand also gifted the seal of orchestration."
