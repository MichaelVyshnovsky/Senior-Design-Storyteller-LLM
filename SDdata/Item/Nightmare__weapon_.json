        "mainbody": "Nightmare was an enchanted dagger that was the favored weapon of Baravar Cloakshadow, the gnome deity of deception and illusions.\nThis +4 dagger was wielded by the avatar of the Sly One. Targets hit with this dagger would be coated in a deadly venom that caused paralysis. The immobilized creature would be subjected to the nightmare spell, and lose the effects of their last nights rest. As such, their previous wounds that had healed overnight would re-emerge, and the target would feel absolutely exhausted."
