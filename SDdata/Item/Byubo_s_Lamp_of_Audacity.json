        "Description": "This magic item looked like a normal butter lamp.",
        "Powers": "Only a true follower of the [[Padhran religion]] could hold the lamp without suffering harm, and they would instantly learn its powers. All others would instantly be struck dumb.<ref group=\"note\">Anyone who did not follow the Padhran religion would lose points of Wisdom when touching the lamp.\n\nFollowers of the Padhran religion (whether a priest or not) gained one of the following [[Cleric|clerical]] spells at random if they filled the lamp with oil, lit it, and then meditated with it as a focus for three hours:\n* ''[[creeping doom]]''\n* ''[[confusion]]''\n* ''[[regenerate]]''\n* ''[[chariot of Sustarre]]''\n* ''[[conjure earth elemental]]''\n* ''[[earthquake]]''\n* ''[[fire storm]]''\n* ''[[wind walk]]''\n* ''[[resurrection]]''\n* ''[[control weather]]''\n\nUsers were only allowed to access one of these spells per day and they were required to use the spell within 24 hours or it would disappear.",
