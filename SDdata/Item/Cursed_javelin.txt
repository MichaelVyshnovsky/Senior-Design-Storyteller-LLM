'''''Cursed javelins''''' were magical weapons that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|43}}

==Description==
These weapons looked exactly like regular [[javelin]]s.

==Powers==
A single ''cursed javelin'' would be found mixed within a set of other magical javelins. The other magical javelins allowed the wielder to throw with more accuracy and pierced the target's armor more easily. When the wielder unknowingly threw the single ''cursed javelin'', the missile would strike back at the unfortunate wielder with phenomenal force, causing more pain and harm than a strike from a regular javelin would.
