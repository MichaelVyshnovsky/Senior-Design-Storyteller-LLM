The Hammer of Vorbyx was the unique enchanted warhammer that once belonged to Vorbyx, the ogre "First King of Thar."
The Hammer of Vorbyx possessed a +1 enchantments as well as several other offensive and defensive magics. The hammer created a harmful sound when hitting its target, as it was capable of dealing exceptional damage when its wielder landed a particularly lucky blow. Additionally, targets of successful strikes had a good chance of being blinded and deafened.
The original name of the weapon was lost to the ages, however with time it was named after its famous owner, King Vorbyx of Thar. Although unconfirmed, it was believed that the magic bludgeon was plundered from an ancient burial barrow by Vorbyx himself. The Hammer of Vorbyx was primarily used as a scepter that symbolized the Kings authority among the wild orcish and ogre tribes of Thar. When King Vorbyx, without declaring a successor, the Hammer of Vorbyx was buried along with the ogre ruler for it was believed he would need the hammer to make war in the afterlife.
By 1373 DR, the mighty Hammer of Vorbyx ended up in the ugly hands of Kradgar, an ogre leader who allied with wizard Maganus to bring down the city of Zhentil Keep and create chaos in the Moonsea region.
