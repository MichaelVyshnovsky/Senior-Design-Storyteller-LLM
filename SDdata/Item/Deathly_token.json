        "mainbody": "A '''''deathly token''''' was a [[magic item]] that enabled the bearer to use ask questions of the dead, and receive responses.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}}",
        "Description": "[[File:Kelemvor symbol.jpg|thumb|right|''The holy symbol of Kelemvor, as depicted on the token.'']]\nThe token depicted the [[holy symbol]] of [[Kelemvor]], the god of death and the dead, that is, a skeletal arm and hand holding a set of balanced scales. It was set within a ring. Letters in the [[Thorass alphabet]] inscribed on the ring read \"INQUISITORE • VIVITATUM • ENCRONIMUS\".",
        "Powers": "As with the spell ''[[speak with dead]]'', the token animated a corpse in a limited fashion to answer questions for the caster, based only on what it had known in life. Only five questions were permitted and these could be asked by anyone present. Afterward, the corpse would return to death and could not be raised by the ''deathly token'' again. Otherwise, its duration could be length.\n\nThe [[command word]]s for the ''deathly token'' were ''perlamon tergatys''.",
        "History": "[[File:Speak with the Dead Token.png|thumb|'' A speak with the dead token from [[Baldur's Gate]].''|229x229px]]\nFor a time in the 1490s [[DR]], [[Simon Aumar]] apprenticed with a [[cleric]] of Kelemvor. From this priest, he acquired his ''deathly token''.The cleric's deity is unspecified, but is assumed to be Kelemvor based on his holy symbol on the token.\n\nAt the [[Evermoors cemetery]] in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} [[Edgin Darvis]], Simon Aumar, [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]] dug up the corpses of fallen [[Elk tribe]] warriors and used Simon's ''deathly token'' to question them in order to learn the fate of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''. The eternal rest of [[Stanhard Grimwulf]], [[Toke Horgath]], [[Sven Salafin]], [[Ven Salafin]], and others were all disturbed for the sake of a few questions, mistaken identities, and misused spellcasting.",
