Gurts greataxe was a legendary magical greataxe that had a history dating back hundreds of years in the North.
This greataxe shone with a bright light when the nearby temperature was particularly cold (below 0°F or −18°C). This effect could not be deactivated or otherwise concealed.
Gurts greataxe was a +1 thundering greataxe that was particularly harmful against humans. Once per day, its wielder could chill metal as per the spell.
The axe was first wielded by Gurt, the Lord of the Pale Giants, who fought against the expanding human population of the north during the 2 century DR. In the Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR, Gurt fell in battle to the leader of the barbarians, Uthgar Gardolfsson, in a famous battle that marked the ascendancy of humans within the greater Dessarin Valley. Following the battle, Gurts greataxe was buried within Morgurs Mound, where it remained for over 700 years.
During the Second Trollwar, Gurts greataxe was recovered and taken back to the city of Waterdeep by Amphail the Just. The axe was still in Harshnags possession as of the late 15 century DR.
The axe was immediately recognizable by all Uthgardt barbarians, who promptly attacked its wielder on sight.
