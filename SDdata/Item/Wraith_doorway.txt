A '''''wraith doorway''''' was a type of ''[[dread doorway]]'' that housed a [[dread wraith]]. They were always locked, and often had [[magic]]al barriers to prevent them from being opened.

==Effects==
Whenever a creature would touch or pass through a ''wraith doorway'' they had their life slowly drained from them. If they died from this, they would come back in a short time as a [[wraith]]. When this doorway was destroyed, it would release the dread wraith from within.
