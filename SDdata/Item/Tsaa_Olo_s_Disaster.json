        "mainbody": "The '''''Tsaa Olo's Disaster''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] that once belonged to the [[yuan-ti]] [[Zehirite]] [[Serpentlord]] [[Hal'seh]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The [[adamantine]] weapon known as the ''Tsaa Olo's Disaster'' carried a ''+2'' enchantment and dealt significantly more damage to [[human]]s than any other target. Additionally, each slash with the weapon had a high chance of inflicting a dangerous [[poison]] onto the target creature.",
        "History": "''Tsaa Olo's Disaster'' was created some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. It was named after the yuan-ti term \"tsaa olo,\" which meant \"potential slaves\" â€“ humans, who were considered yuan-ti's most troublesome enemies. Its potent magics were created especially to be used against humans. In 1374 DR, ''Tsaa Olo's Disaster'' was in the scaly hands of the Serpentlord Hal'seh, who served the interloper deity [[Zehir]] in the [[Temple of the World Serpent]] on the border between [[Chult]] and [[Samarach]]. After Hal'seh was slain by a band of heroes who aided merchant princess [[Sa'Sani]], ''Tsaa Olo's Disaster'' left the possession of the Serpentlord and its further story remain unrecorded."
