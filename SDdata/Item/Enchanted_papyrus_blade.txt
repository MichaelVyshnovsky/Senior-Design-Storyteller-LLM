'''''Enchanted papyrus blades''''' were magic [[katana]]s of impeccable crafting skill and devastating ''[[dweomer]]s'' weaved into, wielded only by the most accomplished individuals.

==Description==
When a person held these exotic [[sword]]s, they immediately noticed their artful design, graceful curve, and deadly sharp edge. ''Enchanted papyrus blades'' were a pinnacle of smithcraft.

==Powers==
Each of the ''enchanted papyrus blades'' held a collection of powerful [[enchantment]]s. When the blade was wielded in battle, it magically increased the defenses of the wielder, gracefully guiding their hand in defecting attacks. This property was equal to a ''+3'' enchantment to the welder's defense. The wielder also affectively became a master of katana blades, gaining proficiency in battle dodging, battle movement speed, greater focus while wielding the blade, the ability to cleave their enemies with monstrous force, and improved chances of the wielder landing especially lucky slashes on their opponents.

Immediately offensive magics weaved into these katanas was a ''+5'' enchantment to punishment dispensed. Each hit generated magical heat that scorched the opponent, and its ''[[keen]]'' edge could land especially devastating slashes.

On top of that, ''enchanted papyrus blades'' were imprinted with several spells that the wielder could unleash. ''[[Haste]]'' could be activated once per day, ''[[fear]]'' could be cast twice per day, and lastly, ''[[Balagarn's iron horn]]'' could be unleashed once a day.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a battle [[mage]] named [[Maevhaun]] wielded deadly spells and an ''enchanted papyrus blade'' as he competed in [[Westgate]]'s [[Quivering Thumb Arena]].
