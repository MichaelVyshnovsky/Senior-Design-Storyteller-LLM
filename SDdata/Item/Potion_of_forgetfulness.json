        "mainbody": "A potion of forgetfulness was a draught that destroyed the drinkers memories.\nIf drank on its own, it caused forgetting of all that was experienced in the last 24 hours, including memorized spells. If split in quarters, adding a quarter of the potion to a non-alcoholic beverage produced a memory lapse of all mundane declarative knowledge only, which lasted only one to four hours half of the time. Adding it to an alcoholic beverage caused nothing but a rage in the drinker and a terrible taste.\nSuch potions could be made out of obliviax."
