        "mainbody": "A '''''potion of forgetfulness''''' was a draught that destroyed the drinker's memories.",
        "Powers": "If drank on its own, it caused forgetting of all that was experienced in the last 24 hours, including memorized [[spell]]s. If split in quarters, adding a quarter of the potion to a non-alcoholic beverage produced a memory lapse of all mundane declarative knowledge only, which lasted only one to four hours half of the time. Adding it to an alcoholic beverage caused nothing but a rage in the drinker and a terrible taste.",
