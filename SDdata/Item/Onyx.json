        "mainbody": "Onyx was part of the agate family of ornamental stones but was considered a semi-precious stone when found in pure black, pure white, or in straight bands of both colors.\nThis semi-precious stone was carved for jewelry and decorative housewares and was hard enough to wear well. It was often used for sculpting figurines (including the magic onyx dog). A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.\nThere were \"nine secrets\" that could be enchanted to become an ioun stone and onyx was one of them. Physical contact with onyx helped reduce complications and pain during childbirth. Onyx gems were used by wizards to animate dead as zombies or other undead servants.\n* Onyx was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they used only black ones.\n* Within the tomb of King Haedrak II stood an onyx statue of the ruler.\nUnenchanted onyx was believed to cause bad luck when worn or carried. Elminster has confirmed this suspicion.\nThe lesser drow deity Vhaeraun was known to occasionally send onyx to show his favour or disfavour to his followers. Similarly, black onyx was sacred to the Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and he valued unholy items made of it.\nIt was a common tale that when Shar stepped on Toril, she left onyx stones as her tracks."
