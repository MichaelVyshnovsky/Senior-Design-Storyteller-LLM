        "mainbody": "Longswords were an extremely common and very versatile variety of sword.\nThe design and length of longswords varied between cultures, they could even vary within the same culture depending upon the era. However, the length of longswords generally ranged between .\nMost longswords had a double-edged blade, though some had a single-edged blade, with a sharp point at their tip. They often had grooves known as \"fullers\" that ran the length of their blade, one on each surface, that made the blade both lighter and more flexible.\nMost long swords had an ovaloid metal plate between the blades base and grip, protecting the latter from getting damaged against the metal in the mouth of a sheath, in addition to offering the users hand some protection. A second plate of metal, either circular or ovaloid in shape, would also be fitted on to the pommel.\nLongswords were primarily designed for attacking opponents by slashing at them with the edges of its blade. Opinions varied on the feasibility or viability of dual-wielding longswords.In 1st Edition AD&D the only weapons that could be wielded in the off-hand were the dagger and the hand axe.  Later, the base rules of the 2nd Edition Players Handbook expanded this to include any weapon smaller than the one in the main hand, such as short swords.  Later in that same edition The Complete Fighters Handbook finally introduced game mechanics for wielding dual weapons of equal length, such longswords, with Two-Weapon Fighting Style specialization.  (When Drizzt DoUrden was first introduced wielding dual scimitars it was due to a special 1st Edition Drow racial ability 1st Edition Rangers had no such skill. The idea of Rangers wielding dual weapons was introduced in 2nd Edition.)  That being said, this is primarily an issue of game mechanics rather than lore.
