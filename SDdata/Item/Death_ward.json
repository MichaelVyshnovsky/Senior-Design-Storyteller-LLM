        "mainbody": "Death ward was a magical quality that could be applied to armor to protect its wearer from death magic.\nArmors enchanted with this power often were enameled in black and had an otherworldly translucence. Small images of skulls were often used in the ornamentation.\nWith the first time exposure in a day, and if the wearer desired, death ward armor could automatically make its wearer immune to death-like effects, including negative energy effects, for a period of an hour and ten minutes.\nEnchanting such armor required a death ward spell."
