The Thayan Enclaves across the Sword Coast made a profit by creating and selling valuable enchanted pieces of jewelry. One such type of magical bobble was ''the Wanderer's ring''. These rings were popular and brought profit due to high demand among many traveling wizards who wanted access to an increased number of memorized spells.\n\nThe original design was developed by a young but talented [[Red Wizards|Red Wizard]] [[Johan Kist]] sometime before [[1372 DR]]. The young wizard's apprentice attempted to steal the prototype and sell it as his own invention. Eventually, Johan Kist discovered the theft and tracked down his wayward apprentice. In retaliation, the Red Wizard quickly created a new spell that peeled the target's skin away from their flesh in small strips. Kist tested the effectiveness of the spell on the thieving apprentice but refused to share the spell with others.\n\nBy 1372 DR, many of these popular and valued rings could be found across many locations across the Sword Coast.",
