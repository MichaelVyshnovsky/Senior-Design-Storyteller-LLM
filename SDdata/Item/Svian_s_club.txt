Svians club belonged to a grim, stoic, and intimidating hero of the Tribe of the Elk, Svian, long before 1281 DR. The barbarian was known never to show emption, get excited, nor panic in combat. His battle tactics were simple stand your ground and pulverize every opponent who approaches with Svians club. Later in the heros career, he was mortally wounded in battle. Without showing pain nor suffering, he simply sat down at a nearby rock and passed away. Several hours later, his tribesmen four the body. They never realized he was wounded and did not notice his passing until it was too late.
The barbarian was interred in one of the barrows of the Burial Isle. The club remained there as of 1281 DR, guarded by the spirits of Reghedmen ancestors and later that year, by disturbed undead.
