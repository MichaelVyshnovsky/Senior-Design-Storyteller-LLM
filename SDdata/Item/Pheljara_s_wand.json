        "Powers": "When the designated [[command word]] was spoken, ''Pheljara's wand'' sprung into action, propelling a dull black cord with a sticky end from its tip. The wand's enchantment ensured that the cord traveled in a perfectly straight line, unaffected by gravity, winds, or any movements of the wand itself. It continued on this course, extending outward for a maximum distance of {{SI|190|ft|long=yes}} or until it collided with a solid object. If no obstruction was encountered, the cord remained rigid, connected solely to the wand. It could be placed across a gap or between facing windows of adjacent structures and could even be used to climb vertically by securely wedging the wand to prevent the line from falling.\n\nUpon striking a solid object, the cord adhered to it with remarkable strength, akin to the adhesive properties of a ''[[wand of viscid globs]]''. The bond could only be dissolved by alcohol, and attempting to forcibly break free may result in joint dislocation for trapped individuals. The cord possessed a non-reflective surface, maintaining its texture even when wet, providing a rough texture akin to suede or bark for enhanced traction and grip. It possessed exceptional durability, capable of supporting weights of up to {{SI|2500|lb|k|long=yes}} or the equivalent of ten fully armored [[human]] warriors with their typical equipment, without breaking. The cord was impervious to [[acid]] and other corrosive substances, and it exhibited resistance to fire and prevented the spread of flames along its length.\n\nThe cord eventually dissipated into nothingness, along with its sticky end, once the magic expired or when a being touched the wand and uttered a second command word."
