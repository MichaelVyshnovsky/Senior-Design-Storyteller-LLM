        "Description": "''Asterfellon'' was a light elven-made bludgeoning weapon.",
        "Powers": "The ''Mace of Power'' possessed a powerful +6 enchantment. It also increased the user's wisdom and improved their will, in exchange for reduced dexterity. The user was also able to cast ''[[divine power]]''.",
        "History": "''Asterfellon'' along with its master were long entombed by the time Myth Drannor fell in the Weeping War. In [[1369 DR]], along with a few other tombs of heroes in the depths of the Elven Catacombs, the tomb of ''Asterfellon's'' master's final resting place had the ''Receiver of Respect''. It was designed to release the legendary weapon in exchange for another mundane [[mace]] in times of dire need."
