==Description==
The cloak was long, black, and scaly.

==Powers==
The ''deathwyrm cloaks'' offered some protection from raw magical force damage, but mainly improved the power of the wearer's [[negative energy]] spells and increased the effect of negative energy upon themselves, making them useful for those that regenerated with negative energy like the [[undead]] and [[pale master]] [[necromancer]]s.

==History==
The Cult of the Dragon forces that followed [[Aurgloroasa]] in [[Thunderholme]] used a number of these cloaks in the 1480s [[DR]].
