        "mainbody": "Vanilla was a delicate spice from Maztica. It was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nVanilla was a bean harvested from an exotic type of orchid in the Maztican jungles. To preserve its delicate flavors, vanilla beans purchased through Auroras were individually sealed in vials.\nBeyond Maztica, vanilla was known to grow in the jungle of Malatra. Vanilla was a feature of the spice trade through the town of Pursai in Laothan.\n* Athkatlan clarry was a heavily vanilla flavored and spiced ruby-red wine from Athkatla, the capital of Amn.\n* The native Nubari of Malatra used vanilla for ritual purposes and as a perfume.\n* Vanilla essence was used in making of pastries, including the recipe for the Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire! as appeared in 101 Garlic Recipes by Rab Bitnez.\n* Mindflayers that were healthy from brain-rich diets excreted a thin film of slimy, glistening mucus that gave off a faint odor that was sometimes described as similar to vanilla, although this smell was imperceptible from afar."
