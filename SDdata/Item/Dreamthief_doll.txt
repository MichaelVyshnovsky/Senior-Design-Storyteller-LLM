'''Dreamthief dolls''' were bizarre-looking [[magic]] totems popular in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Helm's Hold]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Dreamthief dolls were usually made of carved wood and a lock of hair of its owner. Instead of hair, some dolls were made using other items with a huge sentimental value to its owner.

==Abilities==
The dolls had a lesser enchantment that made any person sleeping near them remember no dreams he or she may have had during their sleep.

==History==
Dreamthief dolls became popular in the late years of the 15{{th}} century, as people living in Neverwinter and Helm's Hold usually had [[Symphony of Madness|horrible nightmares]], and the dolls allowed them to sleep at ease.

The dolls were made by the [[spellscar]]red patients at Helm's Hold.

==Rumors==
Some people in Neverwinter believed the dolls sent the sleepers' nightmares to the poor inmates at Helm's Hold, despite [[Rohini]]'s assurances that this was not true.
