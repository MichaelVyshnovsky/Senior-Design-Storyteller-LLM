        "mainbody": "Malchors undersun goggles were magical sets of eyewear used to see in the darkness of the Underdark. They were invented by the wizard Malchor Harpell.\nUndersun goggles were enchanted with the eponymous \"undersun\", which enabled wearers normally unable to see in low-light conditions to do so with full sight, albeit with some imperfections. This effect only worked in areas with faerzress.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the optics merchant Beli Bragason freely distributed Malchors undersun goggles to adventurers in the Deep Wastes underneath the Kings Forest."
