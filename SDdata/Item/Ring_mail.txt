'''Ring mail''' was a type of heavy [[armor]] used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Ring mail was [[leather armor]] with large, weighted rings attached to it. Despite having a leather base, this sort of armor was classified as heavy. Its rings helped to reinforce the base against axe or sword strikes. It was inferior to [[chain mail|chain]], [[splint mail|splint]], and [[plate mail]]. However, it was a lot cheaper than the other suits of heavy armor, ''i.e.'', fifty times less expensive than plate mail. It was cheaper and provided more defense than [[studded leather]] armor, for those who were not so dexterous.

Warhorses could don such armor, and again it was the cheapest option.
