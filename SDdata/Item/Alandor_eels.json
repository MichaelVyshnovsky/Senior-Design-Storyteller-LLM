        "mainbody": "Alandor eels was a dish made using the animals of the same name that were abundant in the Alandor River in Zehoarastria region of Amn.\nAlandor eels were big black eels found in the Alandor River, with the brownscale fish being their main prey. Alandor eels were fished using worm ball bait by the locals off of bridges and docks and prepared into a dish of questionable taste. Alandor eels were cooked in handfuls of pepper and drowned in lemon juice.\nIn his guide to the Lands of Intrigue, published in the late 14 century DR, famous (or infamous) writer Volothamp Geddarm described the honor of eating Alandor eels. He thought the creatures to be disgusting and the dish to be rubbery and tasting like dead fish despite all the peppercorns and lemon acid."
