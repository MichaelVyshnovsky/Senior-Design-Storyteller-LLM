        "mainbody": "'''''The Iron Skeleton''''' was a powerful unique [[enchanted]] set of [[plate armor]].",
        "Description": "This heavy armor of silver and black looked eerily unsettling to most. The armor slithered over the body and reshaped itself into a unique-looking new set of plates for each wearer. It protected the wearer from darkness and helped them to meld into shadows.",
        "Powers": "This set of heavy armor carried a powerful ''+6'' enchantment, granted the wearer the boon of ''[[darkvision]]'' and made them immune to all effect of ''[[illusion]]'' magic. Additionally, ''the Iron Skeleton'' increased the wearer's dexterity and nimbleness.",
        "History": "In was unknown who was the mad smith who created this set of armor after being possessed by some darkness. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''the Iron Skeleton'' cropped up several times throughout history, including in the dreaded depths of the [[Underdark]] and in the city of [[Mulmaster]] during the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] crisis of [[1373 DR]]."
