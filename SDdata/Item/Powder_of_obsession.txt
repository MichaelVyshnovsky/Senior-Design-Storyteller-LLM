Powder of obsession was a magic powder that forced others to mindlessly pursue their actions.
Powder of obsession had a pink coloration.
When cast into an area no larger than a  sphere, powder of obsession forced anyone within that area to fanatically pursue whatever action they were performing. Victims affected during combat would attack friend and foe alike. These effects lasted for seven to sixteen minutes.
This powder was used as a form of defense on rare occasions by priestesses of Isis.
