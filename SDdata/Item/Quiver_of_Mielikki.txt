A '''''quiver of Mielikki''''', also known as a '''''quiver of Solonor''''',<ref group="note" name="name">This magic item is commonly called the ''quiver of Ehlonna''. However, Ehlonna is a goddess of the ''Greyhawk'' setting with no presence in the ''Forgotten Realms'' but substituted for Mielikki. Instead, some FR sources rename it as above. Hence, this article uses the ''quiver of Mielikki'' name exclusively. and as a '''''quiver of Ehlonna''''' on [[Oerth]] and other worlds, was a [[magic item|magical]] [[quiver]] that could hold a large number of weapons and ammunition without ever increasing its volume or weight.

==Description==
The ''quiver of Mielikki'' appeared like a well-crafted but otherwise mundane quiver, weighing only {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}} and sized to apparently hold only twenty [[arrow]]s. It had three compartments of different lengths. If examined with ''[[detect magic]]'', it bore an aura of the [[alteration]] or [[conjuration]] [[school of magic]].

==Powers==
Each of the quiver's compartments connected to an [[extradimensional space]] that could hold a variety of items without increasing the quiver's weight. The smallest compartment could hold up to sixty [[arrow]]s or other items of similar size and shape. The medium compartment was slightly longer and could hold up to eighteen [[javelin]]s or comparable objects. The largest and longest compartment could hold up to six objects of the size of [[quarterstaff]]s, [[spear]]s, or [[longbow]]s. Thus, it could store up to 84 items in total.

The bearer of the quiver only had to command it to produce a item, provided it had already been placed inside. Drawing an object from it required no more effort than drawing from a normal quiver.

Shandie Freefoot's quiver only held up to sixty arrows, but magically replenished their supply. 

==Creation==
[[File:Quiver of Ehlonna AD&D TC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A quiver of <s>Ehlonna</s> Mielikki and a ''+1 [[bow]]'' to go with it.'']]
In order to craft a ''quiver of Mielikki'', it was necessary to know the ''[[Leomund's secret chest]]'' [[spell]].

==Availability & Reputation==
It could be purchased for 1,800 [[gp]] and sold for up to 10,000 [[gp]].

As their names suggested, these magical quivers were associated with the faiths of [[Mielikki]], the Supreme Ranger, and [[Solonor Thelandira]], the Great Archer. The Solonorans prized them alongside other magical quivers and bows.

''Quivers of Mielikki'' were favored by [[Damaran]] [[human]]s and they were common in their lands. They could be bought for 10% less than normal in the larger cities of [[Damara]] and [[Impiltur]].
