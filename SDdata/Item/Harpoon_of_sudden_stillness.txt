The harpoon of sudden stillness was a unique enchanted harpoon crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Joppa in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.

Silverhand crafted this broad-bladed spear to react to and recognize Joppas commanding presence.
The harpoon of sudden stillness could be hurled at a foe, which it would attempt to impale, paralyze, and then bring to Joppas side. This left the foe stunned and unable to move.
