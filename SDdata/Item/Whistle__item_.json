Such instruments affected one specific family of animals such as bats, cats, horses, or even mountain lions.\nWhistles could be made out of many common materials, for example wood or bone. They were used by humans and other races, such as hobgoblins and bugbears.\n* The traffic wardens of Waterdeep used whistles and small colored flags to order drovers around.\n* In many goblin tribes, male adults were required to keep a whistle with them at all time.
