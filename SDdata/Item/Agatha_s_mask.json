        "mainbody": "'''Agatha's mask''' was a magical item of [[illusion]].",
        "Description": "Agatha's mask was a plain white stage mask with a simple cord to hold it in place.",
        "Abilities": "When worn, the mask bestowed on the wearer the illusory appearance of another race or monster. This effect only worked as long as the mask was worn and only effective to the naked eye; any magical scrutiny would reveal the true identity of the wearer. No known [[magic]] could detect it.<ref>",
        "History": "For a long time, the mask was in the possession of the [[banshee]], [[Agatha]]. In [[1356 DR]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] needed a way to enter the city of [[Calimshan]] without anyone knowing of his [[dark elf]] heritage. He and his [[barbarian]] friend, [[Wulfgar]], acquired the mask without killing the banshee, as requested by the nearby villagers of [[Conyberry]].\n\nNear the end of 1356 DR, Drizzt gave the mask to [[Regis]], when the [[halfling]] became the master of [[Pook]]'s thieves' guild.<ref>\n\nIn [[1357 DR]], [[Artemis Entreri]] took possession of the mask from the halfling. While seeking a rematch with Drizzt, Entreri transformed himself into Regis on a visit to [[Mithral Hall]]. In the end, Entreri was left critically injured and hanging from a cliff, and Regis stole the mask back, as well as other magical possessions of Entreri.<ref>\n\nLater in the year, Regis offered Drizzt the mask to help him on his journey to [[Menzoberranzan]], but Drizzt turned down the offer. Later, [[Catti-brie]] took the mask to aid her in pursuing Drizzt, by disguising herself as a drow female. She lost control over the mask and it fell into [[Jarlaxle]]'s hands, but she eventually returned from the [[Underdark]] with the mask.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], Jarlaxle used the mask and the same technique as Drizzt Do'Urden to visit [[Memnon]]."
