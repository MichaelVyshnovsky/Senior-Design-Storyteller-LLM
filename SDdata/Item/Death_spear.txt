A '''''death spear''''' or '''''death lance''''' was a [[longspear]] infused with [[negative energy]] and used by elite [[drow]] warriors.

==Description==
These longspears were 10 feet (3 meters) long and made of a dull-gray metal with mottled and sparkling patterns along its length.Additionally, they emanated an aura of negative energy.

==Powers==
A ''death spear'' was a ''+1 longspear''.

Suffused in an aura of negative energy, each blow struck by one of these weapons inflicted additional negative energy that chilled its victim. Additionally, the spear had limited charges to drain the life force of those it impaled, as dark tendrils of black light writhed down the lance. Two versions of these weapons existed; their charges affected the victim to greater or lesser degrees.
:'''Lesser''' This version afflicted the victim like the ''[[enervation]]'' spell.
:'''Greater''' This version caused the victim to suffer from an ''[[energy drain]]'' effect.
 
==History==
The ''death lance'' (or ''death spear'') was invented by powerful [[drow]] [[wizard]]s and used in the protection of the city gates and temples in drow cities.

In [[1372 DR]], at the [[Undying Temple]], above the [[Deep Wastes]] city of [[Maerimydra]], [[Irae T'sarran]] used elite defenders equipped with ''death spears'' to protect her sanctum.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Berg'inyon Baenre]]: Being a master of the ''[[z'har thalack]]'' combat style, he was a particularly good user of a ''death lance''.{{Cite web
