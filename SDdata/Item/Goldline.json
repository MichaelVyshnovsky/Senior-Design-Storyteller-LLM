        "mainbody": "oldline, also called cacoxenite, was the name given to varieties of quartz with lines of gold-colored goethite (an impurity similar to iron oxide) embedded in the matrix.\nThese quartz ornamental stones could be amethyst, citrine, or smoky quartz with bright yellow strands or tufts of goethite running through it in parallel lines. They were typically tumbled or cut cabochon. Specimens could be two to three inches (five to eight centimeters) in diameter. Sometimes large pieces were found, but these were often subject to breakage during transportation.\nGoldline had a use in enchanting metal-bladed weapons. It was held in an open flame while the appropriate spells were cast, consuming the stone and giving a plain knife, sword, or dagger a small bonus. Fortunately, greenstones were relatively common and easy to obtain."
