A chalice of continual water was a type of enchanted chalice that could produce an endless stream of water.
When bent to their lip, these chalices produced a stream of pure, cool water. A chalice would continue to produce a stream of water so long as it was not standing on its base.
* In the center of the Tears of Selune, an overturned chalice of continual water was the source of a constant stream of water that poured out from an open doorway of the unnamed castle on the asteroid known as the Castle, which spilled out into wildspace and followed the asteroids gravity plane.
Sometime in the midâ€“14 century DR, a group of Ravenian adventurers found themselves transported from Toril to the planet Anadia. The adventurers saved a group of pacifist, philosopher Anadian halflings from a group of murderous plainsjans and umberhulks. Grateful for the rescue, the Anadians provided the adventurers a way back to Toril and gifted them a chalice of continual water that had been produced on Anadia. The chalice was made of fine silver and etched with a relief depicting their craggy mountain home, beneath the sun and a galleon spelljammer at its center.
