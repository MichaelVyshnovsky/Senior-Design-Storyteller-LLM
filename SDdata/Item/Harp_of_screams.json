        "mainbody": "'''''Harps of screams''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[harp]]s that acted as alarms and were popular in [[the Dalelands]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "These harps were always carved from expensive wood in the shape of a [[dragon]]. Clutched within the dragon's fangs was a [[gemstone]], worth only two to four [[gold piece]]s,",
        "Powers": "In order to activate the ''harp of screams'' one had to remove the gemstone from its fangs. Once active, a ''harp of screams'' would let out a loud, painful shriek whenever anyone passed within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius of it without playing a certain note. This shriek was so loud that it could be heard from up to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}} and it would continue until its gemstone was returned to its mouth. The only other ways to circumvent a ''harp of screams'' were to cast ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[silence, 15' radius]]'' on it.",
        "Notable Owners": "Most guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more ''harps of screams''."
