Jerrods stone was a stone disc created by the barbarian shaman Jerrod when he sacrificed himself to seal a gate to the Lower Planes.
When the forces of the archmage Arakon attacked Icewind Dale, the Reghedmen and the Uthgardt tribes banded together to defeat the common foe.  On the brink of victory, Arakon opened a portal to Baator.  To save the inhabitants of Faer√ªn, Jerrod leaped into the passageway and stopped the demon horde. Around 1281 DR, Everard of Easthaven, devotee of Tempus, saved Toril from the baatezu Belhifet by using his body to close the portal to the planes.
