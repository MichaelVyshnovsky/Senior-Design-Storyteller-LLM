'''Thieving helmets''' were special helmets worn by some [[rogue|rogues]].

==Uses==
One of the most important senses to a [[thief]] is his sense of hearing. Common helmets muffled the ability to hear lock mechanisms or approaching guards, among other things. A thief wanting to protect their head and still be able to hear had the option of wearing a thieving helmet. 

Thieving helmets were invented by a [[gnome]] from [[Waterdeep]]. They had special ear canals added to the structure of the helmet that amplified incoming sound to a thief's ear. These helmets sacrificed some structural protection in order to make way for the ear canals, but were better than nothing.

==Prices==
A thieving helmet cost 10 [[gold piece]]s.
