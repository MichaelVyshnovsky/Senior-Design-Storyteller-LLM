'''Ggatzshriiegk''' was a magical [[obsidian]] [[javelin]] that could pierce a [[demon]] and be recalled by its owner across the planes.
{{quote|''Ggatzshriiegk pierced the planar boundaries of the Abyss and flew to him, sizzling through the astral flow to the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]], faster than time. With a black flash, it appeared in his outstretched hands.''}}

==Description==
Ggatzshriiegk was a shining obsidian javelin, covered in jagged scales. When thrown, it buzzed like a [[wasp]] with its scales standing up from its surface, making it spin. The javelin always homed in on its target.

==Powers==
With the [[command word]]s ''"I call on ggatzshriiegk"'' said out loud or in one's mind, the magical javelin could be summoned into the hands of its owner. The summoning could be done across the room or across the planes with equal ease. The damage done with the javelin was magical, piercing stone and flesh with ease.

==History==
Ggatzshriiegk was a part of a battle between [[vrock]]s led by [[Shaakat]], and the rescue party of paladins led by [[Aleena Paladinstar]], ''circa'' [[1371 DR]]{{DDTS}}. During the combat, the magical javelin easily pierced and killed two [[barlgura]]s and a simulacrum of Aleena herself in one throw. Eventually, the javelin was broken by one of the paladins and was buried under a collapsed tunnel along with the pyramid and the ''[[portal]]'' where the battle took place.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Shaakat]] was a vrock who owned ggatzshriiegk ''circa'' [[1377 DR]].
