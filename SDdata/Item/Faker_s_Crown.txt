'''''Faker's Crown''''' was the [[enchanted]] decoy headdress that belonged to a king whose name was lost to time.

==Powers==
''Faker's Crown'' carried several enchantments that enhanced the wearer's senses. While it was worn, it improved the wearer's hearing and allowed them to cast ''[[amplify]]'' and ''[[clairaudience/clairvoyance]]'' spells once per day each.

==History==
Even though the name of the king who commissioned this crown was lost to time, the story was not. The king ordered the creation of ''Faker's Crown'' after realizing that his advisers were plotting a coup. In secrecy, the king replaced the real crown with ''Faker's Crown'' just before the coronation. The enchanted headwear allowed the king to crack the conspiracy and capture the treasonous aides. Following that event, ''Faker's Crown'' became a supplemental symbol of regency.

Sometime later, a rogueish traveling [[bard]] swapped the fake and real crowns, leaving the ''Faker's Crown'' in the vault. The same night, she performed for the king. He was so mesmerized by the bard's music that he offered her anything from the castle's treasury. The woman claimed ''Faker's Crown'' and was never seen again.

By [[1372 DR]], the ''Faker's Crown'' fell into the hands of [[Feldran Exeltis]] of the Exeltis noble family, whose winery keep was located in the [[Blade Cliffs]] of the [[Sword Coast]].
