        "Powers": "These ornate helmets possessed ''artificial sight'' that allowed the wearer, or the [[steel watcher]] it was attached to, to see in the dark within {{SI|40'|'\"|long=yes}}, could never be ''[[blind]]ed'', and were equipped with gyronetic and targeting modules. Additionally, ''steelwatcher helmets'' boosted protection of the wearer's constitution.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''steelwatcher helmets'', as well as the other parts of the [[steel watcher]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]], were created by Carixim in Avernus. The items went on to being mass-produced in the Gate by the [[Gondian]]s, enslaved by [[Lord Gortash]], who paved his way to power and tyranny through the construct soldiers."
