Its transformation was not a conscious decision of the wearer but was guided by their true feelings and alignment. In a case when the wearer venerated several deities, the medallion of proof changed to reflect the god that the wearer was most aligned with. On rare occasions when the wearer had no power they worshiped – the amulet turned into a blank disk. The medallion of proofs magic could not be blocked by spells nor other enchanted items, and the medallion could not be used as a holy symbol by paladins nor clerics.\nWhen the amulet represented Chauntea, it depicted a flower bulb on the background of a shining sun with the amulet being encircled by small vines.\nAfter the war against the Tuigan Horde ended in the Vast, a young priest of Chauntea took over the Morden Winery located in a valley outside the village of Dragon Falls. But soon after, the priest – Larn, was petrified by the maedar winemaker Vorlon and his consort – medusa Samanthiss. For the decade that followed, Larn was left a statue with the medallion of proof, adorned with Chaunteas holy symbol hanging on his neck.
