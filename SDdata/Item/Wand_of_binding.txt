A '''''wand of binding''''' was a variety of [[wand]] that provided their wielders both greater ease of escaping capture and the power to entrap foes.

==Description==
A ''wand of binding'' resembled a long [[chain]], ending in a white [[human]]-like head with a metal bit over its mouth.

==Powers==
These wands requirement attunement to use and held seven magical charges that they regained each dawn. Upon their last charge being spent, there was a small chance that a ''wand of binding'' would crumble into dust. The primary power offered by a ''wand of binding'' were the [[spell]]s ''[[hold monster]]'' and ''[[hold person]]'', which took five and two charges to cast respectively. The passive power offered by these wands came in the form of mild skills in escape artistry, enabling their wielders to better escape from another's grasp or avoid being paralyzed or restrained all together.

==Notable Owners==
