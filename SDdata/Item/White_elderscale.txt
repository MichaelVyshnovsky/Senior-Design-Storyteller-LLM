'''''White elderscale''''' was a unique set of [[enchanted]] [[heavy armor]] used in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This ancient set of armor was crafted using scales of an ancient [[white dragon]]. Even damaged, it offered potent protection to the wearer. At its full strength, ''white elderscale'' possessed a powerful ''+4'' enchantment and fully mimicked a white dragon's resistance to cold, as well as magical regeneration. It also slightly increased the wearer's fortitude.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a set of damaged ''white elderscale'' was recovered from the dragon's roost in the [[Sword Mountains]] after a large white dragon was witnessed raiding the lands outside the mines of [[Phandalin]]. Despite the wyrm only feeding on beasts of burden and farm animals, [[Lord Never]] placed a proactive bounty on the creature's head.
