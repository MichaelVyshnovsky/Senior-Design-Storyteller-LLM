        "mainbody": "'''''Briarspikes''''' were [[enchanted]] [[spear]]s forged by [[Menold]] of [[Waterdeep]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "These spears appeared as if they were quills pulled out of the hide of some unknown giant beast. However, ''Briarspikes'' were man-made weapons. Each [[polearm]] bore the markings of Menold, their creator.",
        "Powers": "Each ''Briarspike'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that made the weapon deadlier and strike more true than any similar mundane weapon. Additionally, these spears released bursts of corrosive [[acid]] upon each successful hit.",
        "History": "There existed many ''Briarspikes'', all forged by Menold of Waterdeep. The true number of the weapons remained unknown as the smith was presumed dead as of several years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, when his tower fell under an [[orc]]ish onslaught. The number of ''Briarspikes'' appearing in the wild suggested that he might've attempted to haggle for his life when captured by the attackers, who received a supply of these spears from their \"guest.\"\n\nOne of the ''Briarspikes'' could be found in the weapon vendor stalls of the [[Market Triangle]] in [[Westgate]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
