'''''Nis''''' was a blade created by the [[diviner]] [[Telarian]], using the darkness of [[Nangulis]]'s decanted soul after the creation of ''[[Angul]]''. Its creator meant to use it as part of his plan to release [[Carnis|the Traitor]] from his prison in [[Stardeep]] by merging it with ''Angul'' to create '''''Angul-Nis''''', a weapon capable of sundering the wards keeping the abomination imprisoned.{{cite book/Stardeep|76-78|7}}

==Description==
''Nis'' was a black sword, so black that it registered almost like a gap in perception.

==Powers==
''Nis'' was a powerful blade and the malevolent and nihilistic counterpart to ''[[Angul]]''. It bore some powers that separated it from its counterpart: it boosted its wielder's reflexes to a greater degree, though it was not as powerful as ''Angul'' was in Kiril's hands.{{cite book/Stardeep|262-264|25}} It also granted its wielder the ability to gain visions related to the history of their environment.{{cite book/Stardeep|234, 239|21}}

Just like ''Angul'', it had an overbearing ego, being capable of seducing and twisting even its own creator, Telarian. However, its most salient ability was that it could confuse the otherwise relentlessly discerning ''Angul'' into believing its twin and their wielder possessed unimpeachable characters.{{cite book/Stardeep|278|27}}

Merged with ''Angul'' it would become '''''Angul-Nis''''', a sword capable of damaging the wards that kept the Traitor imprisoned. More than that, ''Nis'' could operate as a trap for the soul of [[Nangulis]], forcing the swords to remain merged even if their shared spirit was against it so long as Telarian wielded the weapon.

==History==
After Nangulis and [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]] constructed ''Angul'' out of all that was good and right in Nangulis's soul, the remainder of his being was stored against future need by Cynosure. ''Nis'' was later forged by Telarian from the fragments of Nangulis's soul that were left over after the forging of ''Angul''; just as the Blade Cerulean carried all that was good and disciplined about him, the Blade Umber bore only the nihilistic, repressed, yet purified and weaponized impulses of his heart.{{cite book/Stardeep|281-282|27}} Though at first Telarian distrusted the blade's influence,{{cite book/Stardeep|106-107|9}} a more and more{{cite book/Stardeep|157-158|14}} constant companion.{{cite book/Stardeep|182-183|17}}

Telarian mostly called upon the blade's ego to soothe his nerves through difficult situations. He used the weapon only a few times, such as to slay [[Brathtar]].{{cite book/Stardeep|159|14}} Telarian carried the weapon while riding out to capture [[Kiril Duskmourn]]; while in the process, he used the blade to slay a [[relic lich]] alongside Kiril.{{cite book/Stardeep|262-264|25}} When the two of them returned to Stardeep, after [[Delphe]] told Kiril that Telarian was the traitor, he used the sword to try to strike her down.{{cite book/Stardeep|281-282|27}}

After ''Angul'' was used to block Telarian's attack with ''Nis'',{{cite book/Stardeep|285|27}} the blades merged into ''Angul-Nis''. Using the sword, Telarian struck down Delphe{{cite book/Stardeep|287-288|28}} and Cynosure; the diviner then began to sunder the wards on the Traitor's prison. On the verge of releasing him, he lost the blade after being stabbed in the back by [[Gage]]. His sword split again into ''Angul'' and ''Nis''. ''Nis'' fell down [[the Throat]] alongside its wielder; the newly sundered ''Nis'' lost its enchantment, and its fragments of Nangulis's soul were released, before the Traitor could use the blade to free himself.{{cite book/Stardeep|299-302|28}}
