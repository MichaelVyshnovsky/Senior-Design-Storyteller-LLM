The Codex of Araunt was a tract originally recorded on stone tablets by Lod, a bone naga and founder of the Eminence of Araunt.
More than five-hundred years before the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, the codex prophesied the slow expansion of the Eminence in the centuries that followed.
The Codex contained several rituals and spells that allowed its user to
* Create portals (called "deathways") that linked distant gravesites and mausoleums together across Laerakond and Faer√ªn, visible only to undead.
* Created undead, like direhelms and doomsepts, from the spirits of dead warriors.
* Empower undead with useful abilities.
* Grant boons to the undead and blights on the living simultaneously.
