The '''''Codex of Araunt''''' was a tract originally recorded on stone tablets by [[Lod]], a [[bone naga]] and founder of the [[Eminence of Araunt]].

==History==
More than five-hundred years before the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR]], the codex prophesied the slow expansion of the Eminence in the centuries that followed.

==Abilities==
The ''Codex'' contained several rituals and spells that allowed its user to:
* Create portals (called "''[[deathway]]s''") that linked distant gravesites and mausoleums together across [[Laerakond]] and [[Faer√ªn]], visible only to [[undead]].
* Created undead, like [[direhelm]]s and [[doomsept]]s, from the spirits of dead warriors.
* Empower undead with useful abilities.
* Grant boons to the undead and blights on the living simultaneously.
