A '''''hair shirt of Ilmater''''', also known as a '''''hair shirt of suffering''''', was a magical horsehair shirt associated with the [[Church of Ilmater|faith]] of the god [[Ilmater]], the One Who Endures.{{cite book/Magic of Faer√ªn|159}}

==Description==
It was, as the name suggested, a thick shirt fashioned of several layers of coarse, brown woven [[horse]]hair, making quite a stiff fabric. These hair shirts were typically quite ragged.

==Powers==
Although the thick and uncomfortable hair shirt impeded the wearer's agility, it was thick enough to provide a high degree of protection against attacks to the wearer. Some later, cheaper versions caused no significant impediment, but only provided slight protection.

The magical hair shirt allowed the wearer to cast ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' once a day, but only on someone other than the wearer, in accordance with the teachings of Ilmater.

==Creation==
In addition to the woven horsehair, a ''hair shirt'' required the [[spell]]s ''[[barkskin]]'' and ''cure serious wounds''.

==Users==
These ''hair shirts'' were typically only fashioned and worn by the followers of Ilmater. They preferred to use the shirt's healing power to alleviate the suffering of others.
