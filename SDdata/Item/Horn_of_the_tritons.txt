 2. The second of these effects allowed a blower to summon a number of sea creatures to their aid, so long as said creatures dwelled within the body of water where the horn of the tritons was being played. namely five to thirty giant sea horses, five to twenty hippocampi, or one to ten sea lions. However, it could also summon five to twenty large sharks or five to thirty medium-sized sharks. Regardless of whatever creatures were summoned, they would be friendly to the individual who sounded the horn of the tritons and obey their every command to the best of their animalistic understanding.
 3. The third effect that could be produced by a horn of the tritons was inducing a panic within a  radius in all aquatic creatures that were intellectually on par with or lower than that of an animal. This was similar in effect to a fear spell, spurring the effected creatures to flee.

They wouldnt involve themselves in the war until a horn of the tritons was stolen by a rogue mermaid and her shalarin companion, who sought to use it to summon aid against their enemies. The tritons gave chase over the theft and not long afterward morkoth allied with Iakhovas invaded the cities of Abydos and Pumana in the Protectorate of Pumanath, taking back fell magic that they would use to fight the Twelfth Serôs War.
