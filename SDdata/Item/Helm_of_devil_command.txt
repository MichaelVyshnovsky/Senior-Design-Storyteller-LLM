'''''Helm of devil command''''' was a magical [[helm]].

==Description==
The helm was bulky and able to adjust to fit on a creature's head.

==Powers==
When worn, the wearer was able to identify the location and type of every [[devil]] within {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}}. The helm allowed the wearer to communicate with either a single devil, or multiple devils at once. This communication was done telepathically. The helm also allowed the wearer to cast ''[[dominate monster]]'' up to three times in a 24-hour period, but only on devils. If the wearer was within sight of a targeted devil while casting this spell, the devil would become aware of an attempt to charm them. If a non-devil wearer used this ability within the [[Nine Hells]], there was a chance it would attract the attention of a [[narzugon]], who would then try to kill the wearer to recover the helm for its master.
