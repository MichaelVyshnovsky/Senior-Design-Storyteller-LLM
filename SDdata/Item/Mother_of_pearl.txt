'''Mother of pearl''' was the name in the Realms for small, cut and polished, [[trochus]] and [[turbo]] shells.

[[Moonshadow Hall]], the temple of [[Sel√ªne]] in [[Yhaunn]], used mother of pearl in decorating its two ceremonial swords, the [[Waxing Crescent]] and the [[Waning Crescent]].

==Description==
They were used for making buttons ''etc.'' and for inlay work. Unpolished, they were sold for as little as 5 [[cp]] per pound (0.45 kilograms). Cut and polished shells had a base value of 5 [[sp]] per pound.
