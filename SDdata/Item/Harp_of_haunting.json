        "mainbody": "'''''Harps of haunting''''' were [[harp]]s [[enchanted]] with ''[[necromantic]]'' magics.",
        "Description": "These grim musical instruments were carved of old bones with [[bowstring]]s of dead adventurers used as harp strings. Their dark nature led many of the owners of ''harps of haunting'' to rarely displaying the instruments or using them in public.",
        "Powers": "Grim or not, ''harps of haunting'' were useful magic items. A [[bard]] who found themselves in possession of one of these harps could ''[[animate dead]]'' with several plucks of string, could cause their opponents to scatter in ''[[fear]]'', and use the spell ''[[scare]]''.\n\nEach ''harp of haunting'' held fifty charges. The ''animate dead'' spell consumed three charges, ''fear'' - two, and ''scare'' exhausted a singe charge.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of these turbulent instruments could be found along the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]] regions. Some well-known bards were seen using these dark instruments against their opponents."
