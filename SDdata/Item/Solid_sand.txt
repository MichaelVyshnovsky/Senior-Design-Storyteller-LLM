'''''Solid sand''''' was a [[magical sand]] originating in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}}

==Powers==
This useful [[sand]] could be tossed upon any soft surface such as snow, mud, regular sand, and even [[quicksand]], where it would instantly harden into a shell that could be walked upon.

A handful of ''solid sand'' could be used to cover 500 square feet or less and lasted for 10-40 minutes.
