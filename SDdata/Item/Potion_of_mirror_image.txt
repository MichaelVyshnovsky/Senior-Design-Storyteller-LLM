Potions of mirror image were a type of magic item that created illusory images of the imbiber.
A potion of mirror image was a white glowing liquid stored in a sealed glass flask.
The effect of these potions was similar to that of the mirror image spell. When consumed, the concoctions magics created between two to six incorporeal images of the drinker. Each illusion was dispelled when the imbiber was attacked by an opponent. The effects of a potion of mirror image lasted for three minutes.
