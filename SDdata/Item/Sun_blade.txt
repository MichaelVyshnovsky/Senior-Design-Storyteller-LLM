A '''''sun blade''''' was a [[magic item|magic]] [[longsword]] whose blade consisted of pure sunlight.

==Description==
When deactivated, a ''sun blade'' appeared to be a longsword hilt with no blade. A creature attuned to it could cause a bright radiant blade to appear or disappear by force of will. The light emitted by the blade could be adjusted by the wielder, and was capable of illuminating a radius of {{SIrange|20|60|ft|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
[[File:Dawnbringer_(sword).jpg|thumb|207x207px|''Dawnbringer'', a sentient ''sun blade''.]]
''Sun blades'' were extremely light and could be wielded with the same finesse that [[shortsword]]s allowed. The light emitted by the blade was actual sunlight and its radiant energy was particularly damaging to [[undead]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Some sages believed that the various ''sun blades'' throughout the [[multiverse]] were modeled after the original ''[[Sunsword]]'', a sentient weapon that was rumored to be lost somewhere in [[Barovia]].

==Notable ''Sun Blades''==

*''[[Scintilmorn]]'', a ''sun blade'' built for the purpose of destroying [[vampire]]s. Lost in [[Undermountain]].
*''[[Dawnbringer (sword)|Dawnbringer]]'', a sentient ''sun blade'' lost in the [[Underdark]].
