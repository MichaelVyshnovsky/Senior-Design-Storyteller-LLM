A '''metsubishi''' was a [[weapon]] unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
A metsubishi was a compact wooden device that expelled a burst of powder directly toward a target's face. It consisted of a mouthpiece situated at one end, a chamber designed to hold the powder, and a small tube located at the opposite end. By forcefully exhaling through the mouthpiece, the powder was propelled through the tube, potentially affecting the target's face. Commonly used substances included [[pepper]], ashes, and dust. This device found frequent utilization among [[ninja]]s for the purpose of diversion and escape, as well as by city constables in their endeavors to apprehend criminals.
