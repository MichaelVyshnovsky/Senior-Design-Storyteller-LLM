        "mainbody": "The '''lyre of progression''' was a unique [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[lyre]] that was created by a [[bard]] named [[Sedini Paletto]].",
        "Powers": "Those who wielded this lyre were capable of memorizing more [[spell]]s then they would normally be capable of doing.",
        "History": "The creator of this lyre always held it close to him, using it to fight off any creatures that dared to attack him and his bardic students. When he grew old Sedini passed it onto his best student, a bard by the name of [[Galwen Alaman]]. After a few years of teaching Galwen set out to be an [[adventurer]] and allegedly lost this lyre by accidentally dropping it while in a marsh.\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], this lyre had ended up in the hands of the merchant [[Gerth]] of [[Kuldahar]]."
