        "mainbody": "The lyre of progression was a unique enchanted lyre that was created by a bard named Sedini Paletto.\nThose who wielded this lyre were capable of memorizing more spells then they would normally be capable of doing.\nThe creator of this lyre always held it close to him, using it to fight off any creatures that dared to attack him and his bardic students. When he grew old Sedini passed it onto his best student, a bard by the name of Galwen Alaman. After a few years of teaching Galwen set out to be an adventurer and allegedly lost this lyre by accidentally dropping it while in a marsh.\nBy 1281 DR, this lyre had ended up in the hands of the merchant Gerth of Kuldahar."
