'''Hematite''' was an [[ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] that was favored by [[fighter|fighters]], as well as a common ore of [[iron]].

==Description==
Typical raw hematite appeared as a hard gray-black crystalline mineral, or as a red stone.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}} Gem-quality hematite had a very fine grain of crystals, and could be polished to a smooth, shiny dark gray or black stone similar in appearance to [[steel]]. It was often tumbled to make beads or cut in a baguette fashion (rectangular with beveled sides).

==Properties==
Hematite weighed about {{SI|306|pound|k|long=yes}} to {{SI|330|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot||long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}} In bulk, it was commonly used as [[iron]] ore.{{Cite dragon/83/The many facets of gems|14}}

Tiny amounts of hematite could be trapped inside [[Sunstone (gem)|sunstone]]s, giving the translucent gem an amber or reddish hue. A similar effect could occur in [[iol]] stones, giving them a secondary golden color.{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|49}}{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|17-18}}

==Powers==
Hematite was not magical itself, but it was responsive to enchantments related to blood and life force and was used in [[necromancy]] and the healing arts. Specifically, it was used to create magical periapts for [[Periapt of health|healing]] and [[Periapt of foul rotting|foul rotting]]. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

Only a handful of people (mostly powerful mages that kept the secret to themselves) knew that this common stone was one of the "nine secrets"â€”minerals that could be enchanted to become ''[[ioun stones]]''. 

==Usages==
* Polished Hematite stones were a relatively cheap and common feature of jewelry.
* Hematite was a common stone among the [[drow]], and was worn by drow of average station. They also often used it on enchanted items.
* The [[lesser deity]] [[Iyachtu Xvim]] was known to occasionally send hematite gems to show favor or inspire his followers.
* The lesser deity [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send hematite gems to show his favour or disfavour to his followers.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}}
* [[Noble dao]] lined the interior of their structures with reflective stones and crystals such as hematite. They used these surfaces to flash light-based messages and alarms throughout their holdings.
