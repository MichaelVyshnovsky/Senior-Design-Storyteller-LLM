Backpacks were a mundane form of portable storage.
Backpacks were large sacks that came in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. These included canvas sacks with shoulder straps and woven baskets with a lid and shoulder straps, though the most preferred type of backpack among travelers was the leather backpack.
Leather backpacks had multiple pockets, on either side and a large one in the back, which could all have their contents secured by a top flap with a tie. They typically had wide, padded straps in the front so they could be carried on the shoulders and leave the hands free. In addition, some leather backpacks were waterproof.
Beyond the standard backpacks sold by most merchants, some were known to commission experienced tailors or leatherworkers to construct specially made backpacks.
