Muskets were a heavier and more powerful variation of the arquebus.
Muskets that came from Lantan typically had the symbol of Gond stamped on the butt of their stock.
Muskets needed to rest upon a support to fire correctly. This typically took the form of a Y-shaped pole that one would jam into the ground. One could technically rest a musket upon anything, but doing so could hinder their chances at firing correctly.
Like all arquebuses, muskets were sturdy enough to be wielded like a club, but they could be damaged in the process.
On the world of Toril, the musket originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the Time of Troubles, after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder.
When the musket and other arquebuses first showed up off of Lantan they were considered mere curios, but after five or so years they became increasingly common. With one source being the Smiths Coster trading company, who conducted business with the Lantanna, Waterdhavians, and elsewhere.
By 1370 DR, one could purchase muskets among other firearms from The Brigadier, a giff gunsmith, in Skullport.
In the first three years that it was available for purchase outside of Lantan, a musket cost roughly 8,000 gold pieces. Through the third to fifth year, as the weapon became more common, the cost lowered to 1,600 gold pieces. Following the fifth year, a musket on Toril consistently cost around 800 gold pieces.
Many in Wildspace considered muskets to be erratic and untrustworthy.
