        "mainbody": "Shiver-strikes were a type of enchanted bolt, originally crafted by elite guardsmen in eladrin kingdoms.\nThese bolts were largely constructed of plain steel.\nDesigned for combating groups of enemies, these bolts would violently split apart upon impacting a target. This sent shards of steel spraying at anything nearby.\n* Following the Spellplague, a number of drow and svirfneblin in the Underdark were known to utilize these bolts."
