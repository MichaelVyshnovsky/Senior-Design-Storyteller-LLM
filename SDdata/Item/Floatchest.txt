'''''Floatchests''''', also called '''floats''', were [[magic item]]s used to store things.

==Description==
A ''floatchest'' was a storage item like a strongchest, casket, or cargo-box made of stout wood. This was the mundane part of a ''floatchest''. The enchanted parts were flat, dark stones inside the mundane storage's false bottom. These stones were mined from the most ''[[faerzress]]''-heavy places and had the power to extend the duration of [[spell]]s cast on an item to one to four years. The spells in this case were ''[[animate objects]]'' and ''[[levitate]]''.

==Powers==
A ''floatchest'' floated in the air. They could be directed by mental command to float in any direction by any person within 30 ft (9 m) who touched the ''floatchest'' and said a possibly secret [[command word]]. Control was lost if a different person touched the float and said the command word or if the float went outside the range of the spell.

A ''floatchest'' could be directed to ram against a target and hit a creature.

==History==
The ''floatchest'' was a magic item associated with the [[drow]]. Within a given drow community, academies, temples, and noble families typically owned one to six ''floatchests''. Merchants who handled dangerous or valuable goods usually owned one to eight when in a caravan and three to twelve when in a community. The ''floatchest'' also had a military use: it could be filled with flammables and made to float above enemies and ignited with flaming arrows or spells.
