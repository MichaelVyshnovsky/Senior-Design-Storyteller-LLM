        "mainbody": "An '''''uskura''''' was a shapeless servant, given form through magic, created by the [[Deep Imaskari]]. It was bound to an object it could not stray far from and was used to take care of menial tasks.{{cite book/Underdark|140}}",
        "Description": "The ''uskura'' referred to the servant itself, which was more of a force than a creature. They were shapeless and transparent, though they were most often bound to a physical object. Of those objects, amulets and ''[[ioun stone]]s'' were preferred.",
        "Powers": "''Uskuras'' had similar functions to an ''[[unseen servant]]'', except that their weight limit was of {{SI|25|pounds|k|long=yes}} and they could generate effects of greater strength, as well as move slightly more quickly. Most ''uskuras'' operated for up to a hundred minutes a day, though many Deep Imaskari artisans could devise ''uskuras'' of greater duration, and citizens could have more than one, to have round-the-clock service.",
        "History": "''Uskuras'' were a Deep Imaskari invention and were in widespread use within [[Deep Imaskar]], where most people possessed at least one.\n\nIn {{yearlink|1373}}, [[Ususi Manaallin]] bound an ''uskura'' to her ''[[delver's orb]]'', which she had personally fashioned.{{cite book/Darkvision|14|2}} The ''uskura'' was destroyed during a confrontation with a supernatural darkness created by the [[Elder Evil]] [[Pandorym]].{{cite book/Darkvision|286|29}}"
