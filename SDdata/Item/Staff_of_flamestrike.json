        "mainbody": "The staff of flamestrike was an enchanted quarterstaff that belonged to a half-elf adventurer Faeril circa 1369 DR.\nThe Staff of flamestrike appeared to be a simple quarterstaff carved using birch wood.\nFaerils staff possessed the ability to blast a target with divine fire as if stricken by a flame strike spell.\nIn 1369 DR, the staff of flamestrike was in Faerils possession when she ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor, along with many other adventurers, following Elminsters call for aid against the Cult of the Dragon that planned to use the ruins mythals and the Pools of Radiance to conquer the region.\nConsequently, Faeril, wielding her staff of flamestrike, joined the second band of heroes, who arrived from Phlan, on their quest to stop Kya Mordrayn and Pelendralaar."
