        "mainbody": "ods of passage were powerful enchanted tools that allowed its wielders to traverse the Prime Material and planes alike.\nRods of passage possessed several potent traversal magics. Each rod allowed the wielder to cast the following spells, one at a time astral travel, dimension door, passwall, phase door, and teleport without error. These rods possessed a limited number of charges. However, each charge simply activated the rod of passage. Once activated, a rod could cast each of the listed spells once. The activation lasted for 24 hours, or until each spell was dispensed. If a wielder attempted to re-cast one of the rods spells, it exhausted additional charge and reset all other spells, making them ready for use.\nWhen a rod of passage used the astral travel function, it allowed for the transportation of up to five creatures, including the rod user. Upon activation of the astral travel function, rod could not be used again until the wielder returned from the Astral Plane.\nRods of passage radiated auras of the alteration and evocation magic. Recharging was extremely hard and only wizards of utmost arcane power could successfully accomplish that feat.\n*Alustriel Silverhand was known to bear a rod of passage on occasion.\n*Shadeus, a Calishite thief and a member of the Twilight Blades in the late-14 century DR.\n*Vandemar Cordwin, General in service of Tempus from Arrabar in the Vilhon Reach circa 1370 DR.\n*Ysele the Cat, a half-elven wizard from Skullport circa the late-14 century DR."
