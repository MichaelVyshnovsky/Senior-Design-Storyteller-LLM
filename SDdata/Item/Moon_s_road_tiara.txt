The '''moon's road tiara''' was a piece of [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] regalia held by [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]].

==Description==
The tiara was an ornate and heavy crown of six crescent moons surrounding a full moon, representing the [[Lunar calendar|lunar cycle]].

==History==
The tiara was an old favorite of [[Dhauna Myritar]], but she eventually stopped using it due to its weight.

[[Feena Archwood]] found the tiara too heavy and preferred lighter and more elegant accoutrements.

Later, Dhauna found use for it as a handy paperweight while reading scrolls.
