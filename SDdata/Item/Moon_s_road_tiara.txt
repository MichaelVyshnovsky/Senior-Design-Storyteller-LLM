The moons road tiara was a piece of Sel√ªnite regalia held by Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn.
The tiara was an ornate and heavy crown of six crescent moons surrounding a full moon, representing the lunar cycle.
The tiara was an old favorite of Dhauna Myritar, but she eventually stopped using it due to its weight.
Feena Archwood found the tiara too heavy and preferred lighter and more elegant accoutrements.
Later, Dhauna found use for it as a handy paperweight while reading scrolls.
