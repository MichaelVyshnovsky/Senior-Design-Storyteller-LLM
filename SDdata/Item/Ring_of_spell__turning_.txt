==Description==
It was a rather nice [[platinum]] ring bearing a "T" rune. To ''[[detect magic]]'' and similar spells, it had an extremely faint magical aura.

==Powers==
When the wearer of this ring was targeted by a hostile spell, the ''ring of spell "turning"'' activated and, rather than protect the wearer, spoke in a clear voice " Turning. Tee-you-arr-enn-eye-enn-gee. Turning."

==History==
Nimrod intended to create a companion ''ring of spell "storing"'' but abandoned when uncertain many "R"s there were.
