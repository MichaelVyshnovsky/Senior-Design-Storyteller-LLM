The ring of spell "turning" was a magical ring invented by the mage Nimrod of Nump of the Misbegotten Realms.
It was a rather nice platinum ring bearing a "T" rune. To detect magic and similar spells, it had an extremely faint magical aura.
When the wearer of this ring was targeted by a hostile spell, the ring of spell "turning" activated and, rather than protect the wearer, spoke in a clear voice " Turning. Tee-you-arr-enn-eye-enn-gee. Turning."
Nimrod intended to create a companion ring of spell "storing" but abandoned when uncertain many "R"s there were.
