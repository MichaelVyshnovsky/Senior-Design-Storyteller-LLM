        "mainbody": "Captains Cutlass was a unique sword wielded by the avatar of Valkur, the Captain of the Waves.\nCaptains Cutlass was usually a cutlass, but could transform into a trident upon Valkurs command.\nThe weapon carried a powerful +3 enchantment as both a cutlass and trident. At will, the wielder of the Cutlass could cast any spell from the weather sphere once per minute. In trident form the weapon was affixed to an unbreakable tether that extended to whatever range Valkur attempted to throw the weapon. Valkur could not be knocked over or toppled from a ship while holding the tether. He often used this to tow ships to shore."
