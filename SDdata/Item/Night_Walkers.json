        "mainbody": "Night Walkers were a type of magic boots, associated by the followers of the god Shar.\nThese black boots appeared darker than the nights sky, while emitting no detectable dweomers.\nOriginally, these boots were very strongly enchanted, and allowed the wearer to move swiftly, without revealing their magical presence. They even allowed the wearer to step through a door of invisibility, several times per day.\nOver time, their powers faded somewhat. By the 15 century DR, Night Walkers made the wearer immune to becoming enwebbed, such as the effects of the web spell and natural webs produced by spiders. It also allowed them to teleport themself by stepping through dark mist.\nThese boots were originally created in honor of the Mistress of the Night, Shar.\nOne pair was worn by a Dark Justiciar, a member of the church of Shar that had gained admittance by killing a member of the Church of Sel√ªne. Very self-assured, the Dark Justiciar was a among the Sharrans that raided Moonhaven in the , but died during the assault.\n* Alorgoth, founder of the Order of the Dark Moon.\n* Nere, a True Soul of the Absolute that dwelled within Grymforge."
