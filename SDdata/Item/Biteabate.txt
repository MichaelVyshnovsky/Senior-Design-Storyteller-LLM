'''Biteabate''' was an ointment that soothed bumps and bruises received from rough treatment.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|85}}

==Description==
Biteabate was an off-white gel made by the [[sorceress]] and [[alchemist]] [[Angrath Dree]] from [[herb]]s and saps found in [[northwest Faerûn]]. It could be purchased from her at [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] in [[Red Larch]], or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a jar of ointment was 20 [[gp]].

==Powers==
Each application of biteabate healed minor injuries such as those incurred during a fist fight, similar to a ''[[cure light wounds]]'' for more life-threatening wounds. It also relieved pain and reduced headache resulting from such a pummeling.
