        "mainbody": "'''''Drums of deafening''''' were enchanted musical instruments that shattered eardrums when struck.",
        "Description": "These kettle [[drum]]s came in a pair. Each had a diameter of {{SI|1'6|'\"|c|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "Nothing would happen if only one of the drums was struck. However, if both drums were struck at the same time all living creatures within {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} of the drums were permanently [[deaf]]ened. Anything within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the drums was also severely stunned. The deafness could be restored if the shattered eardrums were magically ''[[heal]]ed''.\n\n[[Bard]]s could invoke the magic of each drum separately, striking one to stun nearby creatures and striking the other drum to deafen creatures.",
        "Notable Owners": "A pair of ''drums of deafening'' could be found within the [[Ring of Venerable Contemplation]] in [[Kuo Meilan]] in the [[Hordelands]]."
