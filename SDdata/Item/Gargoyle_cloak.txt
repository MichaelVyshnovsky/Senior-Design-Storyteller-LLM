A gargoyle cloak was an enchanted cloak capable of transforming the wearer into a gargoyle.
The wearer could use the cloaks power up to three times per day. The transformation occurred as soon as the cloak was donned. There was a cumulative risk that the wearer would actually believe they were a gargoyle the longer they remained in that form. If this occurred, the wearer could only be returned to their normal form via a wish.
Sememmon, the ruler of Darkhold, owned a gargoyle cloak.
