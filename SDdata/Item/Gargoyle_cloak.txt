A '''''gargoyle cloak''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] capable of transforming the wearer into a [[gargoyle]].

==Powers==
The wearer could use the cloak's power up to three times per day. The transformation occurred as soon as the cloak was donned. There was a cumulative risk that the wearer would actually believe they were a gargoyle the longer they remained in that form. If this occurred, the wearer could only be returned to their normal form via a ''[[wish]]''.

==Notable Owners==
[[Sememmon]], the ruler of [[Darkhold]], owned a ''gargoyle cloak''.
