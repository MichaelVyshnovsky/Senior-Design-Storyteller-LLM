        "mainbody": "Dunzrins harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers.\nThrough a silent act of will, the last person to play Dunzrins harp could command it to record speech, music, and other sounds, and later play them back upon request. This feature allowed non-harpists to feign playing a beautiful melody while playing back a previously recorded tune. Additionally, a spying Harper could use the instrument to capture an incriminating conversation for others to hear.\nThe harp had the ability to store up to three different sound recordings, each lasting several minutes. The user could instruct the harp to ignore any music it played during recording, ensuring that musical sounds did not interfere with the recording of other sounds. However, the fourth recording automatically erased the earliest recording, regardless of its length or the users preference."
