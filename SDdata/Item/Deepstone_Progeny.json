        "mainbody": "Deepstone Progenies were several enchanted battleaxes created to slay a vampire named Torgin of the Light sometime before 1372 DR.\nThese axes possessed a +2 enchantment and made the wielder completely immune to death magic.\nDeepstone Progeny axe was modeled after the weapon wielded by a renowned undead hunter Torgin of the Light, until he was turned into that which he hated the most, a vampire. Torgins comrades made an oath to end Torgins existence as a bloodsucking creature of the night. They enchanted at least several copies of Deepstone Progeny and took the weapons to battle their old friend. History books did not know what happened next however, Deepstone Progenies eventually started appearing across Faer√ªn."
