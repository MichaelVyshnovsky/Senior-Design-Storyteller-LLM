'''''Blackguard's greaves''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[medium armor]] ornate-plated [[boots]] that were once worn by a [[blackguard]] and later by a [[death knight]] they became.

{{quote|''Clad on the desiccated feet of a death knight, these boots have walked a long and terrible path. They strode through the tattered remains of their owner's oath. With every heavy footstep, they have sounded pure fear into the hearts of men.''}}

==Powers==
The boots possessed a simple enchantment that allowed the wearer move faster and further in combat, similarly to the permanent effects of the ''[[longstrider]]'' [[spell]], and increased their skills and proficiency in acrobatics.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''blackguard's greaves'' were worn by the guardian death knight called [[That Which Lurks (death knight)|That Which Lurks]], who, along with [[That Which Guards]] and [[That Which Watches]], guarded the entrance to the chamber of the [[Bhaalist]] [[Murder Tribunal]] in the [[Undercellar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].
