Dagger in the Fire was the name given to a special whisky from the town of Tulmene in Tethyr.
The libation was aptly named for its strength. It felt like flames licked the imbibers throat and it brought tears to the eyes.
As of the late 14 century DR, Jaxom Lesters Dagger in the Fire was served at The Fast Sails tavern in Tulmene â€“ a town perched between the Dragons Neck and Dragons Head Peninsulas. Despite its chaotic and inconsistent wine list, Dagger in the Fire was a stand out for locals and Volothamp Geddarm, who mentioned the whisky in his guide to Amn and Tethyr. A single glass costed one silver piece.
