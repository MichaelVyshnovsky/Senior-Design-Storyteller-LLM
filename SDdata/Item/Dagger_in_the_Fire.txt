'''Dagger in the Fire''' was the name given to a special [[whisky]] from the town of [[Tulmene]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
The libation was aptly named for its strength. It felt like flames licked the imbiber's throat and it brought tears to the eyes.

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Jaxom Lester]]'s Dagger in the Fire was served at [[The Fast Sails]] tavern in Tulmene â€“ a town perched between the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula|Dragon's Neck]] and [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]]s. Despite its chaotic and inconsistent [[wine]] list, Dagger in the Fire was a stand out for locals and [[Volothamp Geddarm]], who mentioned the whisky in his guide to [[Amn]] and Tethyr. A single glass costed one [[silver piece]].
