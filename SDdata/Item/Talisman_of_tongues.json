        "mainbody": "The '''''talismans of tongues''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[talisman]] that allowed the wearer to understand all spoken and written languages.",
        "Powers": "Wearing the ''talisman of tongues'' imparted the benefits of a ''[[tongues]]'' or ''[[comprehend languages]]'' [[spell]] onto the wearer. In addition to understanding all languages, the wearer could also speak all languages while wearing the talisman. The wearer could also ''[[read magic]]'' and understand magical [[Mulhorand]]i script.",
        "History": "Though several of these items existed in the past, the [[priest]]s of [[Thoth]] hunted them down and destroyed them in order to prevent foreigners from learning Mulhorandi [[magic]]. Only one remained as of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
