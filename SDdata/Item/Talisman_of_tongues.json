        "mainbody": "The talismans of tongues was a unique enchanted talisman that allowed the wearer to understand all spoken and written languages.\nWearing the talisman of tongues imparted the benefits of a tongues or comprehend languages spell onto the wearer. In addition to understanding all languages, the wearer could also speak all languages while wearing the talisman. The wearer could also read magic and understand magical Mulhorandi script.\nThough several of these items existed in the past, the priests of Thoth hunted them down and destroyed them in order to prevent foreigners from learning Mulhorandi magic. Only one remained as of the mid-14 century DR."
