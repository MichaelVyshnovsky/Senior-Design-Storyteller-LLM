'''''Winged Masks''''' were enchanted full-face masks that allowed its wearers to ''[[fly]]''.

==Description==
''Winged Masks'' were created out of shaped plates to resemble bird wings and feathers. The feathers extruded from all the sides of these full-faced masks.

==Powers==
The masks allowed the wearer to ''fly'' at will and when the enchantment was active, they glowed with white light. The masks' enchantment allowed to lift about {{SI|50|lb|k|long=yes}} of additional weight in addition to the wearer themselves. If the wearer gotten grappled or weighted down they fell to the ground as if under the effects of the ''[[feather fall]]'' spell.

==Creation==
''Winged Masks'' could be created by capable wondrous item crafters using the spells of ''feather fall'', ''fly'', and ''[[light]]''.

==History==
In 1369 DR, [[Ellis]], the commander of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], was occupying the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], making base in the [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Ellis' ''Winged Mask'' was worn by Ellis' during he day and left in his quarters in the Castle Cormanthor's sub-levels at night.
