The '''''Leaves of Green''''' was a divine spellbook and a holy book of [[Silvanus]].

==Description==
It appeared to be a flat oval-shaped piece of fissured dark gray bark with a triangle of three circles scratched on its inner surface. To change it to its true appearance, one of the names of Silvanus had to be spoken aloud while the speaker pressed on the wood inside all of the three rings. This made the bark grow into a book with pages that were lush, square, waxy green leaves. Each of its sixteen pages bore a single spell.

It contained the following spells:
* ''[[Barkskin]]''
