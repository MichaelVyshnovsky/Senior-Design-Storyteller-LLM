        "mainbody": "oldmanes Dazzler was a magical lantern.\nGoldmanes Dazzler was an exquisitely crafted artifact, appearing as a lions head meticulously carved with eyes of large green gemstones, affixed to a cylindrical base of gold. The materials employed in its construction were of substantial value, amounting to thousands of gold pieces. A handle, composed of gold with an ivory grip, extended from the lions ears. Unique among lanterns, Goldmanes Dazzler emitted light from its open jaws without the necessity for any combustible fuel. This luminosity was perpetual and could not be extinguished once the jaws were parted. Inscribed on the reverse of the gold cylinder were the words \"Dazzle\" and \"Roar,\" rendered in the Common script.\nWhen the jaws were opened and the command \"Dazzle\" was spoken, a beam of dazzling light emanated from the lions mouth. This beam functioned similarly to the spell confusion. This ability was ineffective against creatures that were blind and could only be activated once every 24 hours.\nWhen the command \"Roar\" was spoken and the jaws were opened, several effects occurred simultaneously. Firstly, the light dimmed, and the eyes of the lion glowed intensely. Secondly, there was a significant inrush of air, which extinguished all torches within . Immediately following this, the lions head emitted a powerful roar. This roar deafened all creatures within  and generated a cone of force that extended  in length and  in width at the end. Any creature within this cone suffered damage and was knocked off its feet. The cone of force also destroyed doors and light wooden structures less than  thick, and inflicted structural damage to stone or earth structures. If used underground, it had the potential to cause a cave-in. This powerful effect could only be utilized once per week.\nGoldmanes Dazzler was crafted in the city of Myth Drannor at the height of its cultural prominence. It was the work of a skilled dwarven goldsmith and was enchanted by the wizard Goldmane, designed to be both a masterpiece of beauty and a potent magical artifact. When Myth Drannor fell, the lantern was taken by an elf mage named Silverhair, who intended to transport it to Evermeet. However, Silverhairs party was ambushed by a band of orcs. Utilizing surprise and superior numbers, the orcs overpowered the elves and enslaved them. The lantern remained in the hall of the orc chieftain until it was stolen by a group of halfling thieves known as Swifthand, Inc., who infiltrated the lair and absconded with a significant amount of treasure, including the lantern.\nThe halfling band sold the lantern to a trader on the Wyvernwater in Cormyr, who subsequently sold it to a wealthy merchant from Arabel. The merchant kept the lantern for several years until his death, at which point he bequeathed it to a favored nephew residing in Scornubel. Unfortunately, the caravan transporting the lantern to the nephew was attacked by bandits just west of High Horn. The merchants nephew offered a substantial reward for its return."
