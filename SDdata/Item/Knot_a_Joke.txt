A '''''Knot a Joke''''' was a [[enchanted]] ball of string that likely fell into the possession of several [[adventurer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The overall appearance of the ball was similar to that of an ordinary ball of thick string. It was golden yellow.

==Powers==
It allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and to tangle up opponents. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Knot a Jokes'' could be found in [[Neverwinter]], [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Mount Hotenow]], and [[Neverwinter Wood]]. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such balls were likely found by the adventurers that stopped [[Orn]], the [[fire giant]].
