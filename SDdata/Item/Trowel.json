        "mainbody": "A trowel was a hand tool used for digging and construction.\nTrowels had broad, flat heads that let them carry materials such as construction mortar or earth.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold trowels for masonry and bricklaying work. They came in  (2 gp),  (4 gp), and  (5 gp) sizes, with a flat edge and a grooved edge. It was also possible to have these trowels with a personalized sigil added, but this required positive identification of the stonemason to prevent fraud.\nTrowels were used by masons to spread mortar for construction work, alongside other basic tools such as hammers, chisels, squares, and brushes. The flat, wide head of a trowel also made it suitable for handling and spreading other semi-liquid materials besides mortar.\nTrowls could also be used for gardening and other types of delicate digging, such as archaeology.\nA rusty iron trowl was kept on display in the Lost Level of Undermountain, a relic that Melair I himself supposedly used to spread mortar."
