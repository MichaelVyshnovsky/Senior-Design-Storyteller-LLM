'''''Ansrivarr''''' was a large heavy-hafted [[greatsword]],{{Cite dragon/407/Blades of Kings|29}} one of the six [[Cormyrean Swords of State]], that originally belonged to [[Mondar Bleth]]. Its name is the [[Elven language|elvish]] word for "memory". After Mondar's death, the sword was taken by [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]].

It was used actively by Faerlthann and his sons, but beyond this it became a ceremonial sword, used only during coronations. [[Baerauble Etharr]] and [[Alea Dahast]] wove magical enchantments into the sword that made it very nearly invulnerable.
