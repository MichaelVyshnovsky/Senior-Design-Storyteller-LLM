        "mainbody": "Rings of holiness were enchanted golden rings that were popular among the cleric worshipers of Helm in the years following the Time of Troubles.\nRings of holiness were divine magic enchanted items that granted their user additional spell slots, one per level for 0 to 4, and was only usable by clerics.\nSome versions of the rings of holiness were usable by druids and shamans.\nThe Church of Helm held a belief that the rings of holiness were created out of a supremely powerful magical ring that was gifted to Helm by Ao for the gods faithful service during the Time of Troubles. Helm diluted the artifacts power and split it into the rings of holiness to pass the gift upon his followers in the Realms.\nNon-Helmite sages and scholars doubted that origin story, as, in their eyes, Ao was above such mundane human emotion as gratitude. Because of that, the Helmite story was considered nothing but propaganda.\n*Honorary Ring of Sune the version of a ring of holiness of the Sunite faith, awarded by the church to its clerics who were recognized for their integrity and kindness.\n*Ellesime the elven queen of Suldanessellar.\n*Mulahey the agent of the Iron Throne responsible for creating the iron crisis.\n*Xithiss a mind flayer trader under Baeloth Barrityls control from the Black Pits of Underdark."
