The Absolutes talisman was a magical amulet bearing the mark of the Absolute.
This triangle-skull talisman was stained by blood in the shape of a hand. Such amulets were only gifted to the most faithful of the Absolute, such as True Souls.
When worn, this amulet allowed whoever wore it to survive longer. If the wearer became badly injured, and they dealt damage to another creature, they would regain some of the heath they had previously lost.
