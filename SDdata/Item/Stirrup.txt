'''Stirrups''' were a type of accessory for [[saddle]]s, designed to help riders climb on to them and better control their mounts. They also enabled mounted combatants to put greater force behind their attacks and remain on their saddles when struck by forceful blows.
{{Quote
|A man who tells the truth should have one foot in the stirrup.

==Description==
Stirrups typically consisted of leather straps that were attached to each side of a saddle by a hook and several ties. These straps ended in a metal foot rest, either in the form of a ring or a pointed cup.

==Usage==
[[File:Spellplague FRCG.jpg|thumb|260px|''[[Thunderstorm]] shows off the proper usage of a stirrup.'']]
A stirrup was controlled with the foot. For example, [[Benelaius]] speculated that [[Kendra]]'s big feet helped her hold her stirrups well and ride better.<ref>

If a rider fell from the saddle, they risked getting their foot caught in a stirrup and being dragged on the ground or even beneath their mount, so they would try to free their foot when they fell.<ref>

==Availability==
* In [[Athkatla]], one could find stirrups for sale at the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]].<ref><ref group="note" name="Duty">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item featured in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.
* In the hamlet of [[Longsaddle]], [[Nalathar's Fine Stirrups & Spurs]] provided customers high-quality stirrups of a plain design for a single [[silver piece]] each.
* In [[Zhentil Keep]], one could find stirrups for sale at [[Lita's Equipment]].<ref><ref group="note" name="Lita">''[[Ruins of Zhentil Keep]]'' states that everything from the ''Arms and Equipment Guide'', except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Lita's Equipment.

==History==
Stirrups were not invented on [[Toril]] until after the fall of the [[Netherese Empire]]. The eventual introduction of the stirrup allowed the [[polearm]]s known as [[lance]]s to become prevalent weaponry for those on mounts. It was considered nearly impossible for a mounted fighter to charge effectively with a leveled lance without them.

The eventual introduction of both the saddle and stirrup in the land of [[Zakhara]] caused the vehicles known as [[chariot]]s to gradually fall out of widespread use.

==Notable Users of Stirrups==
* Stirrups were considered essential for the sport of [[jousting]].
===Businesses===
* [[Norge Greenback's Horses]] kept a lot of stirrups in storage for handling their horses.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/103/The Living City: The Horse Businesses|15}}
===Regions & Settlements===
* Stirrups were utilized by horseman in the [[Hordelands]].
* Stirrups were utilized in the land of Zakhara.

==Trivia==
The war god [[Tempus]] was said to most often, prior to battles, manifest as a warrior riding with a foot in the stirrup of two separate horses. Symbolizing the chaotic nature of warfare.
