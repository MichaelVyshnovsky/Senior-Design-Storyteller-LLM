The '''furnace wagon''' was an experimental non-magical self-propelled [[wagon]] developed by [[Nadul DaRoni]].
{{Quote
|A man sees an [[ox]] and knows it has greater strength than he, but lesser wisdom. He uses wisdom to put his burden on the ox. Even more powerful than the ox is the elementsâ€”[[earth (element)|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]], and [[water]]. The [[elements]] support the ox and the man. Man is far wiser than the elements. So I try to make a wagon to put the burden of man on the elements.

==Description==
Nadul's device was a [[coal]] furnace placed atop a small wagon, which used the mechanical power of hot air for propulsion. The furnace's heated air turned a low-[[gear]]ed fan, which connected to the rear axle and pushed the vehicle along. The wagon could not pull itself up inclines of more than 5 degrees, and required {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} of coal fuel for eight hours of operation. It could carry a total of {{SI|400|lb|k|long=yes}} of weight (half of which was the fuel).

There was a decent chance of the furnace wagon spontaneously exploding while in operation, though Nadul had only heard of one person dying from it and considered it a negligible risk. For those afraid of fire, he invented the [[hand wagon]].

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered the furnace wagon built by Nadul DaRoni, valued at 150 [[gp]].
