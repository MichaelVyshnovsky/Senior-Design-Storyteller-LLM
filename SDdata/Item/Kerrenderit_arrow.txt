Kerrenderit arrows were magical arrows made by arctic dwarves from kerrenderit crystals.
Kerrenderit arrows were made with arrowheads carved from the namesake crystals, and required the imbuement of chill metal to be properly fashioned. The result of all this effort was a superior magical arrow that flew further and left grievous bleeding wounds, although it risked melting into nothing if exposed to temperatures above  for more than an hour.
