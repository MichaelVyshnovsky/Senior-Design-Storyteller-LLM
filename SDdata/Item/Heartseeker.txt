Heartseeker was a spear enchanted with the hishna spell create talisman.
Heartseeker was a heavy spear that more resembled a footmans lance. The head of the spear was hardened obsidian that was layered with hishna magic.
The hishna magic protected the obsidian head from shattering as that material was prone to do. The other enchantments on the weapon made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their targets. True to its name, heartseeker was particularly adept at piercing a targets heart for an instant kill.
