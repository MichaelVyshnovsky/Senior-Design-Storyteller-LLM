The seax was a type of bladed weapon utilized by some members of the Tribe of the Bear and Tribe of the Elk in Icewind Dale in the 15 century DR.
The blade of a seax could be short like a dagger or longer like a short sword. The last third of the blade gradually tapered towards its point, granting it greater ease of use.
