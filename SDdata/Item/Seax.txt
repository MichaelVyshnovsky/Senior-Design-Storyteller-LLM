The '''seax''' was a type of bladed weapon utilized by some members of the [[Tribe of the Bear]] and [[Tribe of the Elk]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The blade of a seax could be short like a [[dagger]] or longer like a [[short sword]]. The last third of the blade gradually tapered towards its point, granting it greater ease of use.<ref>{{Cite dragon/232/A Flurry of Swords|32}}
