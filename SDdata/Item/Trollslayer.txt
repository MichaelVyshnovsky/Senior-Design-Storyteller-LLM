The '''''Trollslayer''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]] especially effective against [[troll]]s.

==Powers==
The crimson blade possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and became a powerful ''+4'' enchantment when wielded against trolls of any breed. In addition to slashing damage, the ''Trollslayer'' burned its targets.

==History==
The ''Trollslayer'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}} by a [[wizard]] named [[Epp the Foolhardy]]. The weapon was created for the spellcaster's [[ranger]] companion [[Farl Greenbog]] who spent his life exterminating the troll population in [[north Faerûn]]. With ''Trollslayer's'' use, Farl managed to push trolls further south, away from his homelands. However, the triumph was short-lived as the ranger was ambushed and slain by a band of troll [[shaman]]s and Epp the Foolhardy could not reach his ally in time. Epp incinerated the shamans with his [[spell]]s and recovered the ''Trollslayer''.

By 1281 DR, the ''Trollslayer'' found its way to the hands of [[Conlan]], the smith of [[Kuldahar]], a village on the [[Spine of the World]].
