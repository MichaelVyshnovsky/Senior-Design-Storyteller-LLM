        "mainbody": "arlic Slicer was a corrosive and offputting dagger that was created by the garlic-obsessed wizard Rab Bitnez.\nGarlic Slicer was an ordinary-looking short but sharp dagger that reeked of garlic.\nRab Bitnez peeled and sliced countless cloves in his life, so many in fact, that the blades edge absorbed the properties of garlic, making it corrosive to unprotected skin, dealing acid-like damage when wielded in combat. The negative effect of the blade, however, was its pungency, effectively reducing the owners charisma.\n*Rab Bitnez had Garlic Slicer in his possession circa 1372 DR."
