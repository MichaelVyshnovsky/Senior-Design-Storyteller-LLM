        "mainbody": "'''Garlic Slicer''' was a corrosive and offputting [[dagger]] that was created by the [[garlic]]-obsessed [[wizard]] [[Rab Bitnez]].",
        "Description": "Garlic Slicer was an ordinary-looking short but sharp dagger that reeked of garlic.",
        "Powers": "Rab Bitnez peeled and sliced countless cloves in his life, so many in fact, that the blade's edge absorbed the properties of garlic, making it corrosive to unprotected skin, dealing [[acid]]-like damage when wielded in combat. The negative effect of the blade, however, was it's pungency, effectively reducing the owner's charisma.",
        "Notable Owners": "*Rab Bitnez had Garlic Slicer in his possession ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]."
