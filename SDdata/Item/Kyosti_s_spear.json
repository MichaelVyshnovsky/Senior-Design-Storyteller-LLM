        "Powers": "''Kyosti's spear'' was a masterfully crafted and ensorcelled [[polearm]], imbued with a ''+1'' enchantment that guided its tip towards the target when wielded in melee or if thrown. The design and magics of the weapon had a chance of dealing devastating piercing damage to its target.",
        "History": "Kyosti, along with the best artisans of the Wandering Village, deep in the cold tundra of the [[Frozenfar]], spent many mons crafting and enchanting his weapon. The resulting polearm was a simple-looking weapon like its owner and the village. Kyosti still carried his spear when he was lured away from the village by his wife [[Carita]] and her lover [[Leevi]]. The hunter was murdered by the couple, and his spear was left in a makeshift grave along with the mutilated body in the  {{YearlinkName|1312}}.\n\nSome days later, a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]] arrived to the Wandering Village, seeking passage to the remote town of [[Kuldahar]]. The village's elder [[Suoma]] offered guidance in exchange for several good deeds for the village. One of them was investigating Kyosti's disseverance and his mute [[ghost]] appearing in the wilderness. Subsequently, the adventurers discovered the truth of the grizzly murder, and the hunter's ghost gifted them with his prized spear as a reward for letting his spirit rest."
