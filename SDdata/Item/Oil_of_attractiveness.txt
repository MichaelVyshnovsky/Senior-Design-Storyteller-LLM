Oil of attractiveness was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider at the bottom than they were at the top.
When applied to the face, this oil made the user more physically attractive. This effect lasted longer for less attractive people than it did for more attractive people, usually for 6 â€“ 12 hours. If the user left the oil on their face longer than this time period, then the oil transformed into an oil of horridness and the exact opposite effect was achieved.
