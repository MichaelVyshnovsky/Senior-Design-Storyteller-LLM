The '''''mijayrah''''' ({{Pronounce|mih|JAY|rah}}) was a basic recorder from [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
These simple instruments were made from reeds.

==History==
Because they were relatively easy to make, ''mijayrahs'' were used by both the urban [[Al-Hadhar]] and the nomadic [[Al-Badia]]. They had a short range but created a pleasant, breathy tone. Musicians typically hummed while playing a ''mijayrah''.
