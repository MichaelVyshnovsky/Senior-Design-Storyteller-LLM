'''''Assassin's dice''''' was a set of two [[enchanted]] mythic [[dice]], used as a unique sort of ranged weapon by [[assassin]]s of the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
''Assassin's dice'' were carved out of a green substance with a skull carving on one of their sides. The dice radiated a green magical glow.

==Powers==
These wondrous items were used as weapons, thrown at the assassins' enemies. The dice thrown determined the target's fate upon collision: dramatically reduced ability to land a successful attack, reduced chance of landing powerful lucky blows, crippled ability to avoid attacks, and removed ability to deflect blows.

The dice's powers were boosted if used as a set that included the ''[[assassin's choker]]'' and ''[[assassin's belt]]'', boosting the assassin's chances of landing lucky deadly strikes and their chances of avoiding incoming attacks.

==History==
''Assassin's dice'' were among the enchanted items found deep within the [[Northdark]] Reaches of the [[Underdark]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
