'''''Ring of Twilight''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that possessed dark protective magics.

==Powers==
''Ring of Twilight'' was a band decorated with a tiny [[onyx]] pyramid within which one could see swirling darkness. This magic granted the wearer protection whilst they remained obscured by shadows or darkness.

==History==
One such ring was left within an ancient traveler's chest in the town of [[Reithwin]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], amidst a decaying battlefield where a force of [[Harpers]] crashed with the [[Dark Justiciars]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
