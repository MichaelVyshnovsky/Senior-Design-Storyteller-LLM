        "mainbody": "A moon was a crescent-shaped coin minted by the city of Silverymoon.\nCirca 1358 DR, the moon was referred to as an Electrum Moon, and was a shining blue crescent-shaped electrum coin, valued at 2&nbspep (1&nbspgp) in the city of Silverymoon and 1&nbspep elsewhere.\nBy 1372 DR, the metal had changed and the moon was a shining gold crescent. It was accepted throughout the Silver Marches at a value of 2&nbspgp.\nThen, in the late 1480s and early 1490s DR, electrum was in use again. Still a shining blue crescent-shaped coin, it was valued at 2 unicorns (platinum pieces) in Silverymoon, and 1 platinum piece elsewhere. In addition, there was also the eclipsed moon, which consisted of a moon stamped with a silver wedge to complete its round form. It was worth 5 unicorns in Silverymoon, or 2 unicorns elsewhere."
