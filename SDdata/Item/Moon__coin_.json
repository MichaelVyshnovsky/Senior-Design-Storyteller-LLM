        "mainbody": "A '''moon''' was a crescent-shaped coin minted by the city of [[Silverymoon]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the moon was referred to as an '''Electrum Moon''', and was a shining blue crescent-shaped [[electrum]] coin, valued at 2&nbsp;ep (1&nbsp;[[gp]]) in the city of Silverymoon and 1&nbsp;ep elsewhere.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the metal had changed and the moon was a shining [[gold]] crescent. It was accepted throughout the [[Silver Marches]] at a value of 2&nbsp;gp.\n\nThen, in the late [[1480 DR|1480s]] and early [[1490 DR|1490s DR]], electrum was in use again. Still a shining blue crescent-shaped coin, it was valued at 2 unicorns ([[platinum]] pieces) in Silverymoon, and 1 platinum piece elsewhere. In addition, there was also the [[eclipsed moon (coin)|eclipsed moon]], which consisted of a moon stamped with a [[silver]] wedge to complete its round form. It was worth 5 unicorns in Silverymoon, or 2 unicorns elsewhere."
