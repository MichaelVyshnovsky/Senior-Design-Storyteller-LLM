'''Yeti's breath''' was a cold mixed alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], such as [[the Hidden Lady]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-18 - Yeti's breath}}

==Description==
A yeti's breath was an aptly named ice-cold drink. It felt freezing to the drinker because it contained the essential ingredients of crushed ice and [[tapdragon]] (a [[sugar cane]] molasses-distilled strong alcoholic beverage), with added [[darsargar]] (powdered [[ginger]] root), and [[menthol]], which was made from [[wild peppermint]] plant's oil.
