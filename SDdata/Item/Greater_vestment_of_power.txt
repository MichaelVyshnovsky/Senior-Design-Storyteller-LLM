A '''''greater vestment of power''''' was a [[magic item]] that provided a number of useful magical abilities to the wearer.

==Description==
These items usually appeared in the form of a set of [[robe]]s.

==Powers==
In addition to the powers provided by a set of a ''[[lesser vestment of power]]'', the ''greater vestment'' granted a pair of powers that could each be used up to three times per day. These were ''[[true seeing]]'' and ''[[dimension door]]''.

Each set of ''greater vestments of power'' had its own [[command word]]. Uttering the command word when touching the robes but not wearing them would caused them to become invisible and levitate in place. The vestment could remain in this state for centuries unless made to reappear again. To make the vestment reappear the command word needed to be spoken backwards while within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the vestment.

==Notable Owners==
[[Siamorphe]], the Divine Right, wore some robes that were imbued with the [[magic]] of a ''greater vestment of power''.
