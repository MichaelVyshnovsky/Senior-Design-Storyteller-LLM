'''Bec de corbins''' were a type of [[polearm]] in the Realms that had an infamous reputation.{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|16}}{{Cite organized play/LC/A Handful of Dust|37}}

==Description==
At a glance, this weapon bore a resemblance to a [[lucerne hammer]].{{Cite dragon/22/The Nomenclature of Pole Arms|53}} Bec de corbins had {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} poles, with an awl spike that was shorter and broader than that of a lucerne hammer, and a hooked blade that was the weapon's namesake and comparable to a heavy [[military pick]]'s head. The other end of the weapon was backed by either a clawed or pronged hammer head like the lucerne hammer, a flat hammer head, or even an axehead.

==Weaponology==
These weapons were highly specialized for piercing or slicing through heavy [[plate armor]] with their crow-beak, and then using the weapon's other end to strike the opponent.

==Availability==
Places in the Realms where one could purchase bec de corbins included:
* The [[Weaponers of Cormyr]].

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Ravenian]] merchant [[Bendekar]] had a bec de corbin in his [[Bendekar's House|home's]] expansive weapons collection.
