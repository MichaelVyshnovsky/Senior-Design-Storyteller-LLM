Bec de corbins were a type of polearm in the Realms that had an infamous reputation.
At a glance, this weapon bore a resemblance to a lucerne hammer. Bec de corbins had  poles, with an awl spike that was shorter and broader than that of a lucerne hammer, and a hooked blade that was the weapons namesake and comparable to a heavy military picks head. The other end of the weapon was backed by either a clawed or pronged hammer head like the lucerne hammer, a flat hammer head, or even an axehead.
These weapons were highly specialized for piercing or slicing through heavy plate armor with their crow-beak, and then using the weapons other end to strike the opponent.
Places in the Realms where one could purchase bec de corbins included
* The Weaponers of Cormyr.
* The Ravenian merchant Bendekar had a bec de corbin in his homes expansive weapons collection.
