'''Moktessa''' was a [[wine]] that could only be found within the kingdom of [[Dambrath]].

==Description==
Made from rich white [[grape]]s, Moktessa was enjoyed by [[human]]s and [[drow]]. This fine wine was hard to come by even in Dambrath because of the high demand. It was virtually unknown outside of Dambrath.
