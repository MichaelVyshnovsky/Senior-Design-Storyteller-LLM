'''''Boarding arrow's'''' were [[enchanted]] projectiles used by sailors and pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Powers==
These [[arrow]]s were enchanted to ''[[teleport]]'' the shooter towards the target upon a successful hit. Additionally, these arrows ''[[daze]]d'' creatures they struck.

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the first ''boarding arrows'' were created by a [[half-elven]] pirate named [[Darius Gulch]] who got frustrated with his crew getting tangled up in the rigging when boarding enemy ships. Darius used his booty to commission special enchantments weaved onto [[arrow]]s to outfit his crew with. Ironically enough, Darius's buccaneers' death rate remained high as they kept on ''teleporting'' into a crowd of armed enemy sailors.

''Boarding arrows'' were in common use in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.
