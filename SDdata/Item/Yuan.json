        "mainbody": "The yuan was the second-lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.\nThe yuan took the form of a copper coin with a hole through the center, similar to the fen. One yuan was worth 5 fen, 20 yuan were worth 1 chao or 1 tael, and 200 yuan were worth 1 chien.\nThanks to their holes, collections of fens and yuans were threaded on strings in amounts of 50â€“100, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.\nCategoryCurrency\nCategoryCopper items\nCategoryMetal items\nCategory0-24 gold pieces\nCategoryItems from Kara-Tur\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nobn8ehu9l4jhopgqek7ui3xhbifh09l"
