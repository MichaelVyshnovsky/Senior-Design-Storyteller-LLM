        "mainbody": "The '''''Three White Doves''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[Ilmatari]] mace of [[ivory]], crafted in [[850 DR]].",
        "Description": "This curiously-shaped ivory-headed bludgeon was affixed atop a shaft of black-enameled [[steel]] with its handle carved of ivory as well. The weapon's handle and head were locked in place with [[gold]]en bands. The head of the aptly-named mace was carved in the shape of three white [[dove]]s facing inward to the weapon's shaft. All thee birds had their wings open, forming the mace's flanges.",
        "Powers": "''Three White Doves'' possessed a powerful ''+4'' enchantment and was especially deadly to [[undead]] creatures. A single hit had a chance of instantly destroying an undead creature. When wielded against creatures from the [[Outer Planes]], the mace still had a chance of destroying them. However, the chance of it happening was significantly less than with the undead beings.",
        "History": "The weapons was created by [[Alledec]], a [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]], in the {{YearlinkName|850}}. By that year, Alledec had been fighting for the [[Church of Ilmater]] for two decades and wanted to leave a more palpable legacy than violence. When Alledec died in his sleep, three years after completing the ''Three White Doves'', the mace was bestowed upon a [[fighter]] in service of the Church of Ilmater. Subsequently, the traveling fighter passed the ''Doves'' to an Ilmatari priest [[Recken the Bold]], who, in turn, lost the mace in a battle with a [[vampire]] not far from the [[Trollbark Forest]] on the [[Sword Coast]]. Eventually, Recken the Bold slew the blood-sucking undead, but the ''Three White Doves'' were lost to the church.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the weapon found its way into the hands of [[Quinn Silverfinger]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] in the [[Golden Lodge]] of [[Lonelywood]]."
