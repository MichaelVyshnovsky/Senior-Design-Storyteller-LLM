        "mainbody": "The Three White Doves was a unique enchanted Ilmatari mace of ivory, crafted in 850 DR.\nThis curiously-shaped ivory-headed bludgeon was affixed atop a shaft of black-enameled steel with its handle carved of ivory as well. The weapons handle and head were locked in place with golden bands. The head of the aptly-named mace was carved in the shape of three white doves facing inward to the weapons shaft. All thee birds had their wings open, forming the maces flanges.\nThree White Doves possessed a powerful +4 enchantment and was especially deadly to undead creatures. A single hit had a chance of instantly destroying an undead creature. When wielded against creatures from the Outer Planes, the mace still had a chance of destroying them. However, the chance of it happening was significantly less than with the undead beings.\nThe weapons was created by Alledec, a cleric of Ilmater, in the . By that year, Alledec had been fighting for the Church of Ilmater for two decades and wanted to leave a more palpable legacy than violence. When Alledec died in his sleep, three years after completing the Three White Doves, the mace was bestowed upon a fighter in service of the Church of Ilmater. Subsequently, the traveling fighter passed the Doves to an Ilmatari priest Recken the Bold, who, in turn, lost the mace in a battle with a vampire not far from the Trollbark Forest on the Sword Coast. Eventually, Recken the Bold slew the blood-sucking undead, but the Three White Doves were lost to the church.\nBy the , the weapon found its way into the hands of Quinn Silverfinger, a cleric of Waukeen in the Golden Lodge of Lonelywood."
