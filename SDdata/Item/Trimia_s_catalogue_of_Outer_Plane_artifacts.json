        "mainbody": "'''''Trimia's catalogue of Outer Plane artifacts''''' is an unmarked large book bound in heavy wood. The title of the book and a list of contents can be found on the first page.",
        "Operation": "On selecting a page, there is a 25% chance it will be blank or 75% chance it will describe a magical device which can provide a way of getting to the appropriate [[Outer Planes|Outer Plane]], along with a price from 1,000 to 20,000 gp.\n\nIn order to manifest the device in question, the coin must be laid upon the open book page and have a ''[[vanish]]'' spell cast upon it. The device's command word is the name of the plane of its destination, and it will transport users to a different location on the destination plane each time it is used.\n\nThe device can be used up to once per day, and offers the user a return journey from the destination plane to the point of origin on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Each time the device is used, there is a 5% chance it will disappear once it has finished transporting its users to the destination plane.",

        "History": "In the 1360s DR,<ref group=\"note\">The date of ''Ravenloft: Strahd's Possession'' is unknown; this date is assumed based on other works published at the same time. a pair of [[Hellriders]] of [[Elturel]] used a copy of ''Trimia's catalogue'' along with a collection of other items with powerful correspondences to open a planar [[gate]] and escape the [[Domains of Dread]], after much searching and a confrontation with the [[vampire]] [[Strahd von Zarovich]].<ref>"
