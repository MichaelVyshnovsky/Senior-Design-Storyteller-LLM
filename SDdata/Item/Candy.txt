'''Candy''', sometimes called '''sweetmeat''', was a term used to describe a variety of [[sugar]]y sweet treats, often bite-sized, beloved in many regions of the [[Realms]].

==Description==
Some candy found in [[Waterdeep]] was wrapped in brown [[paper]] packets.

Candy made by [[elves]] were renowned for their delicateness and the speed they melted in one's mouth.

==Varieties==
*[[Candied fruit]] was, perhaps, the most common type of such sweetmeats found across mane locations. A variety of candied fruit was served in [[Elturel]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] and at the [[Great Mother's House]]
at [[Berdusk]]; candied [[persimmon]]s, [[tangerine]]s, and [[banana]]s were found in [[Zakhara]]; and candied [[cherries]], [[pear]]s, and [[carrot]]s were commonly served in [[Westgate]].
*One variety of candy found in the City of Splendor was called hard candy and could be stored for an extremely long periods of time.
*Garlands of small candy [[sword]] and [[dagger]]s were customary decorations for the annual [[Festival of Blades]], hanged across roof beams of interior and exterior venues.
*[[Kara-Tur]]an candy, namely those found in [[Shou Lung]], were made via [[sugar cane]] boiling. A bag-full of these tiny sugar cane candy was sold for a single [[tael]].
