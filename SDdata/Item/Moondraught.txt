A '''''moondraught''''', formerly known as a '''''potion of moon-healing''''', was a potent healing potion used by the [[church of Selûne]].
 
==Powers==
Healing a living being of their injuries, this potion could be drunk in four separate doses, each equivalent to a ''[[potion]] of [[cure light wounds]]'', or all in one shot, giving the full effect of all four. It had an even greater effect on natural or infected [[lycanthrope]]s: after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], a '' potion of moon-healing'' was twice as effective, while after the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a ''moondraught'' was only maximally effective.

==Creation==
These potions were most often created by an appearance of ''[[moonfire]]'' at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess [[Selûne]] was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy.

==Value==
It was valued at 1,500 [[gold piece]]s.
