'''''Immovable boots''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[boots]] that protected the wearer from effects that could impede their movement.

==Powers==
In addition to a simple ''+1'' defensive enchantment, these boots gave the wearer complete immunity to being restrained and ''[[paralysis]]''.

==History==
According to a legend, these boots once belonged to an unnamed [[knight]] who stood watch over his father's tomb for many years. It was believed that the knight's father was interred with great treasures. Many tried to desecrate the tomb and all were stopped by the unnamed knight, who stood unmoving even under enemy [[spell]]s.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a pair of these boots was assembled by a master smith of [[Luskan]] for a fee of 5,500 [[gp]]. He assembled the boots using parts of [[plate armor]] boots looted from near [[Neverwinter Wood]] and pieces of boots fished out of a hungry [[gelatinous cube]] from the [[Temple of Ghaunadaur]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].
