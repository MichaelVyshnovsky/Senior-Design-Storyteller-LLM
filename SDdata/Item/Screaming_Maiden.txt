The '''Screaming Maiden ''' was [[Barjin]]'s one-handed [[mace]].

==Description==
It was the color of [[obsidian]], with the head shaped as the face of a strangely innocent and innocuous maiden. On of its own accord, the maiden's face could shift into a monstrous face with a gaping maw full of sharp venom-tipped fangs, capable of plunging through flesh and bone, which greatly increased the damage inflicted. It was also capable of "breathing" a [[Cone of cold|''cone of cold'']]. It was a sentient weapon capable of establishing [[telepathy|mental links]] with those close to it, and it was always famished and seething with blood lust. The mace would even go as far as calming the wielder in order to be more effective in battle and letting the wielder look through its eyes when blinded.

It was noted by the [[imp]] [[Druzil]] that such a weapon could only be wielded by someone powerful.

==History==
According to Druzil, it had unmistakably been forged in the [[Lower planes]].

Barjin probably used his considerable aptitude as a [[sorcerer]] to get it from the Lower Planes. When not using it, he usually kept it with the rest of his most valuable items.

He brought it with him when [[Talona]]'s worshipers in [[Castle Trinity]] decided to destroy the [[Edificant Library]] with the [[Chaos Curse]] in [[1361 DR]]. He would first use it to kill [[Mullivy]], the library's groundskeeper, who earlier led him to the catacombs of the library where the Chaos Curse was released. When [[Cadderly Bonaduce|Cadderly]] and his companions finally reached the altar room, Barjin used the mace to kill [[Newander]]. However, when he turned to strike [[Danica Maupoissant|Danica]], Cadderly hit the head of the mace with a dart filled with ''[[oil of impact]]'' from his [[hand crossbow]]. The head of the mace shattered, releasing a tremendous cascade of swirling multicolored sparks and some little ''[[fireball]]s'', damaging Barjin and completely ruining his already weakened clothes.
