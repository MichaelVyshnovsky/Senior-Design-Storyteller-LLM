        "mainbody": "'''Shadowlight oil''' was a slow-burning [[oil]] infused with the essence or fabric of the [[Plane of Shadow]]. When burned, it gave off a dim, shadowy light.",
        "Description": "A 1-pint flask of shadowlight oil weighed 1 pound (450 grams) and was valued at 5 [[gold piece]]s.",
        "Powers": "Functioning like regular lamp oil in most respects, shadowlight oil could be burned in any typical [[lamp]], [[lantern]], or other similar light source. Although its light was dim and never fully bright, it extended twice as far as the light of regular oil. For example, if a basic lamp burning regular oil illuminated to a distance of 15 feet (4.5 meters) and half-illumination to 30 feet (9 meters), such a lamp burning shadowlight oil produced half-illumination to 60 feet (18 meters). This was surprisingly useful on the Plane of Shadow: natural light sources were halved in range, but a shadowlight oil lamp was not.\n\nIt was also a slow-burning oil, with one pint lasting for 12 hours.",
        "Creation": "Shadowlight oil could be created by a master alchemist.",
        "Uses": "In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], shadowlight oil was used by [[Church of Shar|cultists of Shar]] to light lamps and lanterns at their hideout in the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]]."
