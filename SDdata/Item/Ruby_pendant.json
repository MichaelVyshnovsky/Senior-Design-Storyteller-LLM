Any creature within 30 feet (9 meters) of the pendant would feel the effects of a charm monster spell. The enchantment remained as long as the creature was within sight of the pendant.\nPasha Pook once owned a ruby pendant, and it was a key to his move to the top of the Calimport criminal world. The gem was stolen by Regis,Dragon (magazine) #386 p.30 for Icewind Dale, where he used the ruby to gain the upper hand in the negotiation in Ten Towns. Artemis Entreri was sent to find the gem and the hin and get them back to Pook."
