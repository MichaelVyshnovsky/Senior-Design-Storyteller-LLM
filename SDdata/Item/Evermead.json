        "mainbody": "Evermead  was a liquor crafted by the elves of Evermeet. Outside of the elven homeland, it was only sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nEvermead was a sweet drink, flavored with cherry juice, vanilla beans, and rose petals. Some compared the drinks taste to honeysuckle breeze, while others - to the taste of upper planes.\nEvermead was the highest prized liquor consumed by the elves. The process by which Evermead was made remained unknown, but it was rumored to be aged for centuries before consumption. A single sip of this fine drink was said to be like tasting the higher planes themselves.\nEvermead was sold by Feldeposts Inn of Beregost in the Western Heartlands and the Friendly Arm inn for twenty one gold coin per serving.\nEvermead was known to be imported into the city of Westgate for enjoyment of the wealth and nobility.\nEvermead could be purchased in the following containers\n* Bottle (30 gp)\n* Hand keg (50 gp)\nBy the late 15 century DR, certain evermead vintages reached exuberant prices. Bottles sealed in 1123 DR were valued at 1,000 gp."
