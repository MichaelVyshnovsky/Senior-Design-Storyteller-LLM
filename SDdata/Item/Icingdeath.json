        "mainbody": "'''Icingdeath''' was the nickname for [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]'s main right-hand [[scimitar]].<ref group=\"note\">The sword Icingdeath first appeared in ''[[The Crystal Shard]]'' but remained nameless until it was called \"the newly named Icingdeath\" as a side-note in the book ''[[The Silent Blade]]''.\n{{Quote|...uncovering a gem-encrusted sword pommel, its black adamantite hilt masterfully sculpted into the likeness of the toothed maw of a hunting cat.|''[[The Crystal Shard]]''}}",
        "Description": "The hilt of this scimitar was black [[adamantite]] and the blade was made of [[silver]] with a [[diamond]] edge.<ref group=\"note\">The appearance of Icingdeath has changed over time. Since [[Todd Lockwood]] began drawing Drizzt, the cat design hilt has gone, and both [[Twinkle]] and Icingdeath now look remarkably similar to each other. This is due in no small part to the release of the replica swords, authorized by Drizzt's author [[R.A. Salvatore]]. Both blades have gone from being curved scimitars to being straight-backed with a tapered point. Both Icingdeath and Twinkle now have [[Drow]] or [[Espruar]] script written on the blades, despite neither weapon being of drow manufacture, though Twinkle retains the distinctive [[sapphire]] in its pommel.{{fact}}",
        "Powers": "Icingdeath was a ''+3 [[scimitar]]''. It had the powers of a [[frost (property)|frost]] weapon. When the sword detected or fed on fire, it started glowing with a pale blue shimmer. \n\nIt was also a ''[[frostbrand]]'' weapon. It also had the ability to extinguish magical fire. For example, it extinguished a portion of the ''[[wall of fire]]'' conjured by the powerful [[demon]], [[Errtu]] and completely negated [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s [[fireball]] in [[Gauntlgrym]]. However, it could also be set on fire in order to harm [[troll]]s, though this was only when the magic of the blade was being repressed.<ref group=\"note\">This is an element from the game ''[[Forgotten Realms: Demon Stone]]'', and so this may not be canon. This possibility could just be for the sake of game play.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Drizzt Do'Urden, famed hero of the [[Companions of the Hall]], found the blade in the treasure pile of [[Ingeloakastimizilian]] the [[White dragon|white wyrm]], better known as \"Icingdeath\", and the weapon's namesake. The [[barbarian]] [[Wulfgar]] and Drizzt killed the [[dragon]] and found the scimitar after a dramatic battle."
