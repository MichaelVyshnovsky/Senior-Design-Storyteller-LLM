'''The Boiler''' was the name given to the infamous [[siege weapon]] used by the [[Flaming Fist]] in defense of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
The Boiler was effectively a giant [[iron]] [[cauldron]] used to pour boiling hot [[oil]] on the heads of invaders attempting to scale the walls of Baldur's Gate. However, the weapon was as dangerous for the operators as it was for its targets. The cauldron often rocked back after being emptied, spraying its operators with blistering oil.

==History==
The Boiler was a gift from the noble family of one of the former Dukes of Baldur's Gate, sometime before 1372 DR. Even though the mechanism became a terror among the Flaming Fist [[mercenaries]], they continued using the deadly machine for fear of offending the noble family of high status. Though multiple attempts to fix the contraption were made, they all were for naught, and the Boiler remained as deadly for the invaders as it was for the defending forces.

During one siege by [[orc]]ish forces, Sergeant [[Lukas Oteril]] saw an opportunity to rid the Fists of the accursed device. The Boiler was emptied several times over the city walls, leaving the defenders without any more oil to use, and Sergeant Oteril ordered the Boiler to be flung onto the heads of the orcs climbing up their makeshift ladders on the walls. As a weapon, the pummeling Boiler did a poor job as more orcs easily replaced the ones crushed by it, but the Flaming Fists were grinning to no end, knowing the accursed machine was no more.

Following the siege, the Boiler disappeared from the battlegrounds. It was said that the chieftain of the invading orcs took the Boiler for himself to be used for cooking. However, later the Boiler resurfaced among many curious items available for sale in [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]]. How it got there was a mystery, and the Boiler was still in [[Torleth Mindulspeer]]'s store as of 1372 DR.
