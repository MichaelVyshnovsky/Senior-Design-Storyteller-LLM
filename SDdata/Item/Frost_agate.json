        "mainbody": "Frost agate, also called frost stone, was a beautiful member of the agate family found in the Realms. They were sacred to the elven god Erevan Ilesere.\nThese rare ornamental stones had white markings that resembled frost over the base color of the stone. They were usually tumbled and polished to a beautiful glassy finish. A master lapidarist could cut the fragile stone in facets, such as in a polyhedron cut,The shape of a d20. so that at each point where facets met, a \"snowflake\" of white \"frost\" appeared.\nFrost agates were often enchanted to be luckstones. Low quality stones were treated like other agates powdered for use in sleeping draughts and other potions.See the potion compatibility table on page 141 of the Dungeon Masters Guide 2nd edition, for example."
