        "mainbody": "A cloak of the manta ray was a wondrous item that allowed its wearer to breathe underwater, and to move faster in water than normal.\nThese cloaks were typically known for granting their wearers water breathing and faster movement in water. Though some were known to polymorph their wearer into the form of a manta ray upon entering a body of salt water.\nA cloak of the manta ray was located at the bottom of the River Sargauth near Skullport. The kuo-toa Hlool knew of its existence, and would give it as a gift to someone if they gave him food.\nSome were believed to have been created by acolytes of ancient water spirits."
