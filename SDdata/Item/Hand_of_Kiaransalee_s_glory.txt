A '''''hand of Kiaransalee's glory''''' was an item with properties similar to a ''[[hand of glory]]'' except it had five [[silver]] rings upon it that each produced a different [[magic]]al power.

==Description==
Each ''hand of Kiaransalee's glory'' was a mummified [[drow]] hand that wore a [[silver]] ring on each finger.

==Powers==
Each of the silver rings upon a ''hand of Kiaransalee's glory'' could manifest a different [[magic|magical power]] at the command of the wearer up to once per day each. The powers manifested were ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]'', ''[[chill touch]]'', and ''[[spectral hand]]''. However, if any of the rings were removed from the hand, they would be rendered non-magical until returned to the hand.

Additionally, if one of the silver rings was replaced with a magic ring then the wearer could gain the benefits of the magic ring just as if she wore it on her own finger; this property worked just like a ''[[hand of glory]]''. If this exchange was performed, then the power of that specific silver ring was unavailable until the silver ring was returned.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the cult of [[Kiaransalee]] made use of this item during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Umaerh]]
