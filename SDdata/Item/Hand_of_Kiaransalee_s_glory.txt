A hand of Kiaransalees glory was an item with properties similar to a hand of glory except it had five silver rings upon it that each produced a different magical power.
Each hand of Kiaransalees glory was a mummified drow hand that wore a silver ring on each finger.
Each of the silver rings upon a hand of Kiaransalees glory could manifest a different magical power at the command of the wearer up to once per day each. The powers manifested were deeper darkness, see invisibility, ray of enfeeblement, chill touch, and spectral hand. However, if any of the rings were removed from the hand, they would be rendered non-magical until returned to the hand.
Additionally, if one of the silver rings was replaced with a magic ring then the wearer could gain the benefits of the magic ring just as if she wore it on her own finger this property worked just like a hand of glory. If this exchange was performed, then the power of that specific silver ring was unavailable until the silver ring was returned.
In 1372 DR, the cult of Kiaransalee made use of this item during the Silence of Lolth.
