A '''''staff of light''''' was a type of [[enhanted]] [[staff]] that existed in the period between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]].

==Powers==
Activating a ''staff of light'' required the [[arcane]] [[spell]] ''[[light]]'' to be cast upon it. For the duration in which that spell was active, the light shining from the staff would inflict [[radiant energy]] upon any nearby [[undead]].

''Staves of light'' came in enchanted variants ranging from ''+1'' to ''+6'' and like any staff they could be used as an [[implement]] in spellcasting.

==History==
Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s operating in [[Tymanther]] were sent into an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site near [[Ruinspoke]] to recover [[Melnar]], a member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]] that had gone missing.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|4-5}}<ref group="note" name="Unther">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. Within the depths of a mausoleum in the area they found the missing Melnar, close to being experimented upon by a [[human]] [[necromancer]] that had made its lair within the ruin. Inside this room the adventurers came across a ''+1 staff of light''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|19}}
