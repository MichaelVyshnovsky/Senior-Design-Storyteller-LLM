Daisy was the unique enchanted light crossbow that belonged to Vicalet Hawkeye the mage-killer sometime before 1281 DR.
Daisy possessed a potent +3 enchantment, and it made it significantly easier for the missiles shot out of the crossbow to reach their targets.
A renowned half-elven mercenary, Vicalet Hawkeye, named this enchanted crossbow for its ability to make its targets to "push up daisies." Famous for his impeccable aim that killed quite a few wizards, Vicalet made a living by selling his services to various adventuring groups. Daisy was always at his side, sniping all spell-casters that Vicalets employees mightve missed. The mercenarys weapon always found its target when crafty wizards tried to protect themselves with the project image spell.
Vicalet Hawkeye retired a wealthy man and spent his later years working on his vineyard. Daisy was sold to an inexperienced and cocky human mercenary, but the ownership was short-lived, just like the mercenary himself. Over time this weapon changed hands until ending up in possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar in 1281 DR.
