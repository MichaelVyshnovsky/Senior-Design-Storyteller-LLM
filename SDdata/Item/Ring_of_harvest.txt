The ring of harvest was a unique and powerful enchanted ring that belonged to the mad spectral lich of Myth Drannor, Thyaast Ammath.
The ring of harvest was a band, carved of bone.
This enchanted ring allowed the wearer to cast the circle of death spell. The band held three charges of the spell.
In 1369 DR, the ring of harvest could be recovered from the laboratory of Thyaast Ammath, in the deepest parts of the Elven Catacombs, by the chasm that led to the Underdark.
