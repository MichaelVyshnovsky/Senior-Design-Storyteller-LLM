'''''Shiver-strikes''''' were a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[bolt]], originally crafted by elite guardsmen in [[noble eladrin|eladrin]] kingdoms.

==Description==
These bolts were largely constructed of plain [[steel]].

==Powers==
Designed for combating groups of enemies, these bolts would violently split apart upon impacting a target. This sent shards of steel spraying at anything nearby.

==Notable Users==
* Following the [[Spellplague]], a number of [[drow]] and [[svirfneblin]] in the [[Underdark]] were known to utilize these bolts.
