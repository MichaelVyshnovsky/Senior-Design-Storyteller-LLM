        "Description": "A few warm shots of Firebeard's Firebrandy were advertised by [[Augrek Brighthelm]] to help in keeping the cold at bay.\n\nThe liquor was in fact a cheap rotgut from [[Mirabar]] that [[Ogden Flamebeard]], proprietor of the tavern, purchased in bulk and then relabeled and resold at a considerably higher price.",
        "History": "Sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the [[dwarven]] criminal [[Worvil Forkbeard]] was known to be addicted to Flamebeard's Firebrandy. Sir [[Baric Nylef]] hoped to use Worvil's cravings for it as an opportunity to catch him."
