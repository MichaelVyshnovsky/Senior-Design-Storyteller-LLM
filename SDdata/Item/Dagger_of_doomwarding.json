        "mainbody": "A '''''dagger of doomwarding''''' was a ''+1 [[dagger]]'' that allowed the wielder to re-attempt any action they took. Upon [[item enchantment|enchantment]], the dagger was imbued with seven charges that could be spent at-will by the wielder. When done, this person could make a free attack, re-attempt to protect themself from a [[spell]] effect, or retry any feat of strength, or the like. Essentially, the dagger protected its wielder from an act of failure by granting them another shot.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}} \n\nUnlike most other [[magic]]al items, these daggers could not be recharged. After all seven charges were spent, they became regular ''+1 daggers''.",
        "Creation": "Among the items needed to craft a ''dagger of doomwarding'' was powdered [[alicorn]] horn, or even better, contact with a living [[unicorn]]'s horn upon the blade."
