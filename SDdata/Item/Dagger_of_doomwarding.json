        "mainbody": "A dagger of doomwarding was a +1 dagger that allowed the wielder to re-attempt any action they took. Upon enchantment, the dagger was imbued with seven charges that could be spent at-will by the wielder. When done, this person could make a free attack, re-attempt to protect themself from a spell effect, or retry any feat of strength, or the like. Essentially, the dagger protected its wielder from an act of failure by granting them another shot. \nUnlike most other magical items, these daggers could not be recharged. After all seven charges were spent, they became regular +1 daggers.\nAmong the items needed to craft a dagger of doomwarding was powdered alicorn horn, or even better, contact with a living unicorns horn upon the blade."
