        "mainbody": "Frost was a weapon quality that could be applied to weapons. Once applied, the wielder could sheathe the weapon in freezing cold.\nA frost weapon dealt extra cold damage to whoever it struck, but the wielder was immune from the effects of the weapon. If firing from afar with a frost weapon, with such as a crossbow or longbow, the ammunition would also have the frost effect.\nA spellcaster needed the chill metal or ice storm spells to create a weapon with this ability.\nSome experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of frost. \n* The followers of certain deities &mdash Auril, Deep Sashelas, Labelas Enoreth, Mask, Mielikki, and Ulutiu &mdash would receive a +1 frost enchantment from casting the spell weapon of the deity and holding that deitys favored weapon. These weapons were a battleaxe, trident, quarterstaff, longsword, scimitar, and longspear respectively.\n* Winters Eye was an enchanted longsword of frost that was lit aflame with multiple continual flame spells as a joke and method of misdirection. It belonged to the commander of the Cult of the Dragon named Ellis circa 1369 DR."
