        "mainbody": "'''''Frost''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that could be applied to [[weapon]]s. Once applied, the wielder could sheathe the weapon in freezing cold.",
        "Powers": "A ''frost'' weapon dealt extra cold damage to whoever it struck, but the wielder was immune from the effects of the weapon. If firing from afar with a ''frost'' weapon, with such as a [[crossbow]] or [[longbow]], the ammunition would also have the ''frost'' effect.",
        "Creation": "A spellcaster needed the ''[[chill metal]]'' or ''[[ice storm]]'' spells to create a weapon with this ability.",
        "Uses": "Some experienced [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of ''frost''.",
        "Trivia": "* The followers of certain deities &mdash; [[Auril]], [[Deep Sashelas]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Mask]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Ulutiu]] &mdash; would receive a ''+1 frost'' enchantment from casting the spell ''[[weapon of the deity]]'' and holding that deity's [[favored weapon]]. These weapons were a [[battleaxe]], [[trident]], [[quarterstaff]], [[longsword]], [[scimitar]], and [[longspear]] respectively.\n\n* ''[[Winter's Eye]]'' was an enchanted [[longsword]] of ''frost'' that was lit aflame with multiple ''[[continual flame]]'' spells as a joke and method of misdirection. It belonged to the commander of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] named [[Ellis]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]."
