'''Stout stew''' was a common dish found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Western Heartlands]], and the [[West Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
A [[broth]]y stew of uniform meat cubes, browned and cooked thoroughly with [[stout]] [[beer]], [[carrot]] medallions, and other vegetables, it was thought to be a comforting dish that sat snuggly in one's stomach and felt like a warm hug.
