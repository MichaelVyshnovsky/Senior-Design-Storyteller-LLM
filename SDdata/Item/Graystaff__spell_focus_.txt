A '''graystaff''', or a '''staff of frost''', was a mundane staff used by [[bheur]]s as a [[Spell focus|magical focus]] for powerful spells.

==Description==
A graystaff was a gnarled wooden staff taller than a bheur. It was not inherently magical and only had powers when held by the bheur who had crafted it.

==Abilities==
When held by a bheur, the staff allowed her to create powerful magical effects, including ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', and ''[[wall of ice]]''. Unless she held her graystaff, she could not cast these spells.

==Construction==
A graystaff was made from a wood that could not be found on the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It took at least a year for a bheur to craft her staff.
