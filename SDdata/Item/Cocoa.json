        "mainbody": "Cocoa was a bean from Maztica that was used to prepare a bitter chocolate beverage. It was available for purchase in spice shops and through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nCocoa beans were small, brown, and nugget-shaped.\nWhen ground into powder and mixed with water, cocoa produced a bitter beverage that was said to possess restorative and stimulating properties. It was also reputed to be an aphrodisiac.\nMaztican chocolate was a widespread success throughout the Sword Coast. The beverage was also very popular in Calimshan, where it was mostly enjoyed by the wealthy in little shops.\nCocoa beans were the main currency of the entire Maztican continent. Although the beans were not accepted as currency in the Sword Coast, they could be exchanged at spice shops at a rate of 100 cocoa beans for 1 gp.\nBeyond Maztica, cocoa was known to grow in the jungle of Malatra. The inhabitants of that land were also known to brew a bitter beverage from it using powdered beans. Cocoa was a feature of the spice trade through the town of Pursai in Laothan.\nThe Maztican deity Watil was the guardian of plants such as mayz and cocoa. Cocoa offerings were typically given to Eha in gratitude for a successful childbirth."
