A '''''rod of whips''''' was a magic [[rod]] that could be commanded to transform into a ''+1 [[dancing]] [[whip]]'' by sprouting a tendril of force.

It functioned three times per day, with each transformation lasting for an hour. This whip acted as a ''[[spiritual weapon]]'' against [[Incorporeal (subtype)|incorporeal]] creatures.

The rod was worth around 21,600 [[gold piece]]s. It could be created with ''[[animate objects]]'' and ''[[spiritual weapon]]'' spells.
