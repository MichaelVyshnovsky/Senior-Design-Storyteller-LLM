'''Harvest Stew''' was a communal [[potato]] dish cooked and served during the [[New Harvest Festival]] in [[Purfbin Doogrick]]'s home burrow.

==History==
Harvest Stew was a highlight of the annual New Harvest Festival, a grand [[gnome|gnomish]] feast. The stew preparation required copious amounts of potatoes, peeled and chopped, which was a task performed by the youths of the burrow. One unfortunate year, sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the celebration and the potato shredding was turned into a disaster thanks to Purfbin Doogrick and his [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]].
