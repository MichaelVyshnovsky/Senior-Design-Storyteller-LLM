        "mainbody": "'''''Houndstooth collar''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Malarite]] collar once owned by a [[goblin]] [[worg]] trainer [[Vghotan]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Houndstooth collar'' was a dirty and rugged spiked strip of leather decorated with crude goblin sorcerous markings.",
        "Powers": "The wearer of this magic collar could call upon its enchantment to summon the ferocity and strength of a worg, turning the wearer's hands into deadly clawed worg paws. This effect was similar to that of the Malarite ''[[beast claw]]'' spell. This enchantment could be triggered once per day. Additionally, the wearer was immune to normal and magical ''[[fear]]'' and never panicked even in the most dire circumstances.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a horde of savage northern goblinoids, monsters, and Malarite cultists besieged the town of [[Targos]] on the shores of [[Maer Dualdon]]. Vghotan commanded a pack of wolves and rode his pet worg into battle against the city's defenders and the mercenaries from [[Luskan]]. The attack failed, and Vghotan was slain. The ''Houndstooth collar'' was peeled off the blood-caked neck of Vghotan's worg in the aftermath. The subsequent history of the magic collar remained unrecorded."
