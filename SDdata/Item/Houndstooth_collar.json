        "mainbody": "oundstooth collar was an enchanted Malarite collar once owned by a goblin worg trainer Vghotan in the early 14 century DR.\nHoundstooth collar was a dirty and rugged spiked strip of leather decorated with crude goblin sorcerous markings.\nThe wearer of this magic collar could call upon its enchantment to summon the ferocity and strength of a worg, turning the wearers hands into deadly clawed worg paws. This effect was similar to that of the Malarite beast claw spell. This enchantment could be triggered once per day. Additionally, the wearer was immune to normal and magical fear and never panicked even in the most dire circumstances.\nIn the , a horde of savage northern goblinoids, monsters, and Malarite cultists besieged the town of Targos on the shores of Maer Dualdon. Vghotan commanded a pack of wolves and rode his pet worg into battle against the citys defenders and the mercenaries from Luskan. The attack failed, and Vghotan was slain. The Houndstooth collar was peeled off the blood-caked neck of Vghotans worg in the aftermath. The subsequent history of the magic collar remained unrecorded."
