        "mainbody": "The '''''darksteel greataxe''''' was an [[axe]] that came to be wielded by the [[barbarian]] [[Holga Kilgore]] in the late 1490s DR.{{HAT-time}}{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}}",
        "Description": "Of dwarven make, the axe comprised a single bit, with a thick hammer-like weight behind it and spikes on the top and bottom of the haft. The haft was telescoping, extending its length from that of a [[battleaxe]] to that of a [[greataxe]] or [[poleaxe]]. An inlay on the haft marked it as the work of [[Ghelryn Foehammer]]. \n\nThe axe was forged from [[darksteel]], giving it a gleaming blade, but it had some spots of rust on the blade. However, following its brief immersion in molten metal, it had a half-melted appearance, with rivulets of metal running back from the edge.",
        "Powers": "Owing to the power of darksteel to absorb all [[magic]]al and mundane electrical energy, including lightning, the ''darksteel greataxe'' granted the wielder resistance to harm from electricity.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves darksteel sparks.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Sparks fly when Holga meets an animated statue.'']]\nA weapon forged from darksteel struck with a slight electric shock.",
        "Usage": "It was recommended to clean the ''darksteel greataxe'' with boiled [[linseed oil]] once every seven days or so to avoid rusting.",
        "History": "This weapon was forged by Ghelryn,\n\nIt came to be in the possession of [[Blackwood (soldier)|Blackwood]], a corrupt soldier in the service of Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 1490s [[DR]]. He was lax in its maintenance, cleaning it only once a month. After [[Sofina]] ordered Blackwood to kill [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] in secret, he led them into a shadowy back alley to execute them. However, Holga recognized his axe as the work of Ghelryn Foehammer and keenly asked about its make, use, and maintenance, and even criticized his laxness. All this bought time for Holga to pry loose a paving stone and use it as a weapon as she escaped and defeated the guards. Then she claimed the axe.\n\nIn her following adventures, Holga used the axe to dispatch one of [[Dralas]]'s [[undead]] [[Thayan]] assassins and to attack the [[red dragon]] [[Themberchaud]].\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves molten darksteel.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''It's still good.'']]\nHowever, during a battle in a blacksmith's forge in [[Castle Never]], it fell into molten metal, giving it a half-melted appearance. Nevertheless, being darksteel, it remained quite effective and retained its properties.\n{{sectstub}}",
