==Description==
These magical items were available in a wide variety.

==Powers==
These staves granted to following powers to a wizard at the expense of one charge: ''[[affect normal fires]]'', ''[[flaming sphere]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[sundazzle]]'', and ''[[sunfire]]''.

The following powers consumed two charges for regular wizards and only one charge for [[Elemental mage|flame mages]]: ''[[conjure fire elemental]]'', ''[[sun stone]]'', and ''[[enhance fire creature]]''.
