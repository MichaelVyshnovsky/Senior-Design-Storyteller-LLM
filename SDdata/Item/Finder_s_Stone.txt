The Finders Stone was a powerful artifact created by Finder Wyvernspur in an attempt to achieve immortality through his songs.
It was made by inserting para-elemental ice into an existing minor artifact, also named a finders stone.Â It contained magical recordings of Finder performing his songs, and the finders stones original detection powers.
The stone was destroyed so the para-elemental ice could be used to destroy Moander.
