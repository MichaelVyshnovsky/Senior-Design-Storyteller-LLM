Butterfly on Skull was a still life painting created sometime before the late 15 century DR.
This prediction of still life showed a skillfully painted scene of a fanned book, a bottle of wine, a vase with a red-leafed plant inside, and a skull. All items are arranged behind a string of kudzu ivy with an orange and black butterfly sat atop the skull. It was unknown how the painter managed to keep the butterfly on the skull during the painting.
In the , the Butterfly on Skull painting could be found hanging on a wall in the farthest room of the Candulhallows Tombstones shop in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate. The painting hid a terrible secret â€“ a switch that exposed a secret door that led to a lair of a Bhaalist cult underneath the city.
