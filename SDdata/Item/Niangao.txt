'''Niangao''' were a type of sweet, flat [[rice cake]] made in the land of [[Kara-Tur]]. Across that continent, many traditionally ate them during new year's celebrations, such as the [[Feast of Lanterns]].

==Description==
These [[rice]] cakes were traditionally dipped in [[brown sugar]] and [[egg]]s, then fried.
