'''''Plaeg''''' was an [[enchanted]] ancient ornate [[shortbow]] imbued with powerful flame [[magic]].

==Powers==
''Plaeg'' was a powerful weapon that held a ''+6'' enchantment that dealt devastating damage and guided [[arrow]]s towards their targets. The bow's magic increased the wielder's finesse at the cost of their strength. Lastly, ''Plaeg'' held three charges of the ''[[flame strike]]'' [[spell]] that could be released at will.

==History==
''Plaeg''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> history was a mystery, however, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, it belonged to the [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]]. The [[undead]] dragon made its lair by the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]], aiding a [[Wearer of Purple]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Kya Mordrayn]], in her quest to corrupt [[Myth Drannor]]'s ''[[mythal]]'' and harness powers of the ''pool''.
