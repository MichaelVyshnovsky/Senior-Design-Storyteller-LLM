Gunstones were magical explosive weapons created in Mulhorand and were strong enough to stun and break through the shell of an adult dragon turtle.
Gunstones were apple-sized perfect globes of silver. The surface was decorated with Mulhorandi picture-glyphs of winged men, hawk-headed humanoids, and women with feline features. These symbols flowed and moved along the perfect silver surface.
When thrown or launched at its target, a gunstone exploded in powerful flare and a thunderous rumble. The power of the explosion was enough to splinter stone and dragon turtle shell, magical and mundane.
In 1362 DR, Artus Cimber was in possession of an enchanted Mulhorandi amulet that bound a silver four-armed guardian to his service. During their journey to Chult, the ship was forced into a conflict with a dragon turtle named Aremag. Skuld, Artus phantom, could summon gunstones and used their explosion to open the dragon turtles shell, making it vulnerable to the crews attacks.
Subsequently, Skulds amulet fell into the cold blackstone hands of Kaverin Ebonhand. The villain used the phantom and his gunstones to lay siege to the ancient city of Mezro, along with the Batiri goblin forces of Queen Mbobo.
