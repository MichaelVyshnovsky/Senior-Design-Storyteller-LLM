'''Urghosh''' was a type of sophisticated locking mechanism of great cunning created by the [[orc]] tribes of [[north Faerûn]].

==Description==
Urghosh locks were of district make; for the unfamiliar, they simply looked peculiar, but [[rogues]] could identify the mechanism's origin. They would also know that urghosh locks were often laced with [[poison]]s such as [[carrion crawler brain juice]], which causes paralysis, among others. Very few thieves and rogues could safely remove said mechanisms, apart from the expert orc rogues who installed them in the first place.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], some of the chests that belonged to the orcish tribes that feuded for territory with other inhabitants of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] were locked and secured by the urghosh. The chests were notoriously hard, almost impossible to safely open for anyone but the owners.
