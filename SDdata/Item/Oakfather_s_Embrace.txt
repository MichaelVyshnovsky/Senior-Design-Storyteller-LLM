{{Quote|''"Nature is the True State of the World"''|Message embroidered on the armor}} 

==Description==
The armor featured a message embroidered into its surface, related to its "order of nature" enchantment. It radiated a subtle amount of divine energy.

==Powers==
In addition to the magical protection it provided, ''Oakfather's Embrace'' possessed an interesting characteristic. Any [[undead]] that struck the wearer were blasted with radiant energy, whereas any [[:Category:beasts|beasts]] that did so, had their attacks imbued with the same force.

==History==
Through unknown circumstances, the armor was lost within the cave of a female [[owlbear]], not far from the [[Risen Road]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
