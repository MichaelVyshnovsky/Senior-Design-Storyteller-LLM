'''''Potions of treasure finding''''' were a type of [[potion]] that aided their imbibers in discovering treasure.

==Powers==
When consumed, these potions provided their drinker with a sort of "directional sense" in regards to treasure, enabling them to feel or sense the general direction of the nearest mass, but not its exact location. The only substances this sense could not penetrate through were special magical [[ward]]s and walls lined with [[lead]]. This mass had to be within {{SI|240|yards|long=yes}} to be detected and its overall weight needed to be equal to at least 10,000 [[copper piece]]s or 100 [[gem]]s.

What these potions classified as "treasure" was solely [[gem]]s, [[jewelry]], and metals considered valuable, such as [[copper]], [[silver]], [[electrum]], [[gold]], and [[platinum]]. Those considered "worthless" would not be detected by these potions. [[Magical item]]s were also not considered valuable by a ''potion of treasure finding'' unless their body consisted in part of some form of valuable gem or metal.

==Variants==
;''Paste of treasure finding'': The people of [[Serôs]] had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion,<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a ''paste of treasure finding'' consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either [[clam]]shells or flexible tubes made from [[eel]]skin.<ref>

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a traveling mercantile store in the [[Mooney And Sons Circus]] known as [[Glitz's And Klax's Potions And Philters]] would sell potions that had one-tenth their normal power. This included ''potions of treasure finding''.

==Creation==
Suggested special ingredients for such potions were six different [[gemstone]]s crushed into a powder, the scale of a [[gold dragon]], or the dust of a [[diamond]].
