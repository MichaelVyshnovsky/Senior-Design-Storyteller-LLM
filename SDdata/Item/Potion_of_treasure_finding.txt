Potions of treasure finding were a type of potion that aided their imbibers in discovering treasure.
When consumed, these potions provided their drinker with a sort of "directional sense" in regards to treasure, enabling them to feel or sense the general direction of the nearest mass, but not its exact location. The only substances this sense could not penetrate through were special magical wards and walls lined with lead. This mass had to be within  to be detected and its overall weight needed to be equal to at least 10,000 copper pieces or 100 gems.
What these potions classified as "treasure" was solely gems, jewelry, and metals considered valuable, such as copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum. Those considered "worthless" would not be detected by these potions. Magical items were also not considered valuable by a potion of treasure finding unless their body consisted in part of some form of valuable gem or metal.
Paste of treasure finding The people of Serôs had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion, suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a paste of treasure finding consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either clamshells or flexible tubes made from eelskin.
In the mid–14 century DR, a traveling mercantile store in the Mooney And Sons Circus known as Glitzs And Klaxs Potions And Philters would sell potions that had one-tenth their normal power. This included potions of treasure finding.
Suggested special ingredients for such potions were six different gemstones crushed into a powder, the scale of a gold dragon, or the dust of a diamond.
