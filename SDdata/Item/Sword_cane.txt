'''Sword canes''' were a type of concealed weapon common in urban settings.

==Description==
These canes appeared to be expensive and well-crafted walking sticks with shafts made of some type of hardwood, usually [[hickory]] or [[oak]]. Concealed within this shaft would be a long, [[stiletto]]-like blade whose hilt acted as the cane's handle. These hilts were typically made of [[gold]], [[ivory]], or [[silver]].

==Availability==
* [[Alamather's by the Water]], a weapon shop in [[Berdusk]] that specialized in the unique and rare, was known to carry sword canes.

==Notable Sword Canes==
* ''[[Cane of the upper class]]'', an enchanted swordcane befitting nobility.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Annie Would I Lie to You|36}}

==Notable Owners==
* These weapons were favored by aristocrats and noblemen. Those with a silver blade were especially popular in areas with [[lycanthrope]]s or [[undead]].
===Individuals===
* [[Dorgar Adarbrent]] often carried a sword cane with him.
* [[Dunstan Balathorp]], the head of the [[Ravens Bluff|Ravenian]] noble house [[Balathorp]] in the 14{{th}} century DR, owned a gilded ebony swordstick.
* [[Rictavio]] carried a silvered sword cane wherever he went.

==History==
A several hundred years prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these became quite popular among high society in the [[Turmish]] city of [[Alaghôn]]. They were ornate and adorned with ivory, [[gem]]s, feathers, and ornate metal finecastings.{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|23}}

By the mid-14{{th}} century DR, only a few members of high society in Alagôn still clung to this fashion, with many of their previous owners having had the canes buried with them. Around that time they were also beginning to become of interest to noblemen and [[thieves]] in [[Sembia]].
