The stolen necklace was a magical necklace found in Wheloon Prison in the mid-1480s DR.
The necklace was of an extremely fine and valuable make, but marred by the lack of its primary gemstone which had been lost through larceny.The in-game description of the item seems to be a somewhat meta reference to the games typically unremarked-on mechanic of setting a gem upon a magical item to improve its attributes. In this case, the stolen necklace is able to receive a gemstone of any sort to reach its full potential.
The sheer flair of the necklace—with or without its key gemstone—was enough to empower the charisma of the wearer.
The necklace was found by Cormyrean forces during the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon as they defended the Wheloon Natives who lived in the drainage culverts, slaying the gang-leading siblings Porto, Aramiya, and Athea Troise in a great battle.
