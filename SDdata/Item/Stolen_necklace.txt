The '''''stolen necklace''''' was a magical [[necklace]] found in [[Wheloon Prison]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|Lost to a pocket, away from it's locket, the gem was precious indeed.
Once fit for a king, of whom bards did sing, the necklace is now in need.

==Description==
The necklace was of an extremely fine and valuable make, but marred by the lack of its primary gemstone which had been lost through larceny.The in-game description of the item seems to be a somewhat meta reference to the game's typically unremarked-on mechanic of setting a gem upon a magical item to improve its attributes. In this case, the ''stolen necklace'' is able to receive a gemstone of any sort to reach its full potential.

==Powers==
The sheer flair of the necklace—with or without its key gemstone—was enough to empower the charisma of the wearer.

==History==
The necklace was found by Cormyrean forces during the [[Shadovar invasion of Wheloon]] as they defended the [[Wheloon Natives]] who lived in the [[Wheloon/Drainage culverts|drainage culverts]], slaying the gang-leading siblings [[Porto Troise|Porto]], [[Aramiya Troise|Aramiya]], and [[Athea Troise]] in a great battle.
