'''Bloodlick''' was a type of paste from the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] that was eaten as a spread for [[hardbread]].

==Description==
Bloodlick was made by cooking meat scraps and animal blood into a thick gravy, and then thinning it with [[bacon]] fat. It was eaten by farmers, often to accompany [[wildsage stew]].
