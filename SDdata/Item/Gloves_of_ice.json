        "mainbody": "Gloves of ice were enchanted hand-coverings suffused with the power of elemental ice.\nThe gloves were permanently encrusted with ice. Their wearer did not need to worry about this ice freezing their own hands.\nWhile wearing the gloves of ice, an individual could invoke their power either to enhance their attacks with the power of cold, or to have their blows ignore some of a foes resistance to the cold.\nThe gloves could be used as a spell focus in an ancient Nar ritual to infuse an individual with primal magic, turning them into a literal force of nature. This ritual required several magic items as foci, also including a cloak of translocation, a versatile spellbook, and a circlet of mental onslaught.\n* Iyraclea, the Ice Queen, left a pair of gloves of ice entombed alongside her iceborn clone in a vault beneath the Delhalls in Vaasa.\n* Kelog, an ancient Nar wizard whose spirit inhabited a ruined keep in the Dunwood through the late 15 century DR.\n* The Duke of Daggerford as of 1479 DR, who held a pair to give as rewards to adventurers."
