        "mainbody": "catstaff was a magical weapon and item that granted thief-like abilities.\nThe typical catstaff was a 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) quarterstaff made of stout, black wood. It contained secret compartments for carrying small items (e.g., thieves tools and material spell components) and was topped with a sculpted cat-head knob. Using it as a weapon did not disrupt or prevent any of its magical effects.\nThe bearer of a catstaff was imbued with a thiefs skill at stealth and climbing walls (provided both hands were free), along with the ability to see in the ultraviolet spectrum out to a range of . They could also cast shadow six times per day, creating a  radius globe of semidarkness for ten to fifty minutes that blocked the bearer from vision and, thus, gazes and other visual attacks.While there was no shadow spell in 1 or 2 edition, the catstaff created the effect as described above. Also, the effect was misprinted in Dragon #99 and The Magister as a 1â€³ radius however, this was subsequently corrected to a 10-foot radius in Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV. A catstaff lost all of its magical powers if it was broken in two."
