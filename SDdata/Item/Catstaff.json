        "mainbody": "A '''''catstaff''''' was a [[magic weapon|magical weapon]] and item that granted [[thief]]-like abilities.{{Cite dragon/99/Seventeen new treasures|50}}",
        "Description": "The typical ''catstaff'' was a 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) [[quarterstaff]] made of stout, black wood. It contained secret compartments for carrying small items (''e.g.'', [[thieves' tools]] and [[material component|material spell components]]) and was topped with a sculpted [[cat]]-head knob. Using it as a weapon did not disrupt or prevent any of its magical effects.",
        "Powers": "The bearer of a ''catstaff'' was imbued with a thief's skill at stealth and climbing walls (provided both hands were free), along with the ability to see in the [[ultravision|ultraviolet spectrum]] out to a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. They could also cast ''shadow'' six times per day, creating a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius globe of semidarkness for ten to fifty minutes that blocked the bearer from vision and, thus, gazes and other visual attacks.<ref group=\"note\">While there was no ''shadow'' spell in 1{{st}} or 2{{nd}} edition, the ''catstaff'' created the effect as described above. Also, the effect was misprinted in ''Dragon #99'' and ''The Magister'' as a 1â€³ radius; however, this was subsequently corrected to a 10-foot radius in ''Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV''. A ''catstaff'' lost all of its magical powers if it was broken in two."
