The set was reassembled in the {{yearlinkName|1369}} by [[adventurer]]s who obtained the individual items from the [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] of [[Barrenstone]], Lord [[Partic Thistle]] of [[Thistleflame Keep]], the ruins of [[Orvaskyte Keep]], and the [[Tower of Ruin]]. In the process, they investigated an old rhyme tied to it provided by the [[bard]] [[Mendryll Belarod]].\n\nThe items came together in the ruins of [[Darkenshield]] as Lord [[Vorik Aris]] began his campaign of raiding the [[Stonelands]] with his personal army. By invoking the ''Four from Cormyr's'' ties to the realm, the ghostly remains of the disgraced [[Starburst Swords]] [[Purple Dragons]] were summoned to battle against the traitorous noble, earning their passage to the afterlife.\n\nAfter these events, Lady Regent [[Alasalynn Rowanmantle]] of [[Tilverton]] requested that the Cormyrean relics be turned over for safekeeping.",
        "Description": "The ''Seal of Iron'' was a bronze disk that made the bearer fearless.\n\n''Silveredge'' was a decorated [[bastard sword]] of ''[[Sword of sharpness|sharpness]]''.\n\n''Deathsend'' was a ''+4 [[dagger]]'' that could only be used in honorable combat, or merciful executions.\n\n''Fireblood'' was a brilliant [[ruby]] that made the bearer immune to all forms of fire.\n\n''Silveredge's'' scabbard had a small sheath for storing ''Deathsend'' and a slot that held the ''Seal of Iron''. ''Fireblood'' was intended to be be fitted into the pommel of ''Silveredge'' itself.",
        "Powers": "When all four items were combined and borne by the same person, additional powers were bestowed that rivaled that of a lesser [[artifact]]. The wielder gained a significant boost to their ability to fight, and could ''[[heal]]'' once per day. Their allies gained a smaller improvement to their combat strength, and also found themselves far more fearless than usual.",
