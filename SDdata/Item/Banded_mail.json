        "Description": "This type of mail was covered in overlapping metal bands, which were sewn to a backing of [[chain mail]] and [[leather armor]]. The bands covered the most vulnerable areas, whilst the backing protected the joints and provided freedom of movement. Buckles and straps were added to balance the weight of the mail. A pair of gauntlets were attached to such mail."
