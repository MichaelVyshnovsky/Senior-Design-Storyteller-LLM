The '''Breath of the Sultan''' was a special fountain found within the [[City of Brass]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
As a symbol of the [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan|Sultan's]] rule, the great fountain was huge. It spewed purple flames high into the air from where it sat.

==Geography==
This fountain was located in [[Furnace (district)|the Furnace ward]] of the city, where it sat in front of the [[Charcoal Palace]].

==History==
The fountain's fire would die out or dim in the event of the Sultan's death or deposition. The new Sultan would then relight the fires of the fountain in a thunderous explosion easily heard by every occupant of the City of Brass.
