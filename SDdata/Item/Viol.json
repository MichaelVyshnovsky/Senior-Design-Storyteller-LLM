        "mainbody": "viol was a six-string instrument similar to a violin.\nViols had a deeply resonant sound that conveyed melancholy themes very well. They could be played on their own or as part of larger ensembles. Viols were particularly favored by dwarves, owing to their deep and dark sounds.\nViols were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, produced by the same craftsmen from Waterdeep and Selgaunt who produced the violins sold through the catalogue."
