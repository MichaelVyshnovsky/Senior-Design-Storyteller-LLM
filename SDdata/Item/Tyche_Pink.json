        "mainbody": "Tyche Pink was a type of blended wine, found in the Western Heartlands, along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nTyche Pink owed its color to a mixture of red and white wines, both were very fragrant. This blended wine was considered to be somewhat a low-class libation and nobles of Baldurs Gate only consumed Tyche Pink as a last resort."
