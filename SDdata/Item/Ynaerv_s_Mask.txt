'''''Ynaerv's Mask''''' was an [[artifact]] known within the ancient [[Imaskar Empire]]. It was once thought to be one of the ''[[Imaskarcana]]''.In its initial appearance, it was an ''[[Imaskarcana]]''; one of its sister artifacts amongst the Faces of Madness is referred to as a ''False Imaskarcana'' on ''The Grand History of the Realms'', retconning it as no longer an Imaskarcana, since the official Imaskarcana have been revealed as predating them.

==History==
An alliance of Imaskari archwizards known as the [[Cabal of Madness]] created a number of [[mask (object)|masks]] known as the ''[[Faces of Madness]]'', each themed around a [[school of magic]], over decades after striking a bargain with horrors from beyond their world. ''Ynaerv's Mask'' was one of them. Each of those major artifacts were created with a curse that only the creator knew how to avoid. Before they were able to implement their plans, however, the [[Mulan]] rebelled with the aid of their gods, ultimately destroying Imaskar as a nation. In the resulting tumult, the masks were scattered.

==Appearance==
''Ynaerv's Mask'' was a hideous mask built from the skull of an [[elf|elven]] [[paladin]], bearing the antlers of her [[mount]]. Small [[copper]] [[chain]]s ran around the back of the mask to secure it; it covered the top of the wearer's face when worn.

==Powers==
''Ynaerv's Mask'' granted an overwhelmingly powerful resistance to all spells of the [[Necromancy]] school. It allowed the user to cast such spells with an amazing level of penetration of innate resistances. The wearer could also employ ''[[control undead]]'' thrice a day, or more, depending on their force of personality. They also got the ability to cast, thrice a day, their choice of ''[[vampiric touch]]'', ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[create greater undead]]'', ''[[create undead]]'' and ''[[soul bind]]''. {{Cite dragon/281/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Imaskarcana: Faces of Magic}}

However, every time the mask was donned, a wearer ran the risk of being slain, and then raised as a [[curst]] were their fortitude to fail them.
