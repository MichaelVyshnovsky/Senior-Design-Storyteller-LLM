        "mainbody": "The '''''Alabaster Staff''''' was a powerful and legendary ancient [[Unther]]an [[artifact]].",
        "Description": "The name of the ''Alabaster Staff'' was a misnomer as the artifact was actually a [[rod]]. It was made of white bone and etched with hieroglyphs of exquisite detail, whose interior were inlaid with [[gold]]. A [[bronze]] band shaped like a flowing river separated the top of the rod of the rest of its body. The top was a piece of black [[amber]]. The ''Alabaster Staff'' was incredibly light, yet it had an indefinable momentum about it that conveyed a sense of consequence.",
        "Powers": "The ''Alabaster Staff'' had the power to command the dead, first [[raise dead|raising them]] and then [[Command undead|bending them to the will]] of the bearer. The ''Alabaster Staff'' was said to be powerful enough to raise whole armies of [[undead]], and it was even able to reanimate the preserved body of a [[demigod]].",
        "History": "According to legends, the ''Alabaster Staff'' was created ''circa'' {{YearlinkName|-2600}}<ref group=\"note\">According to Zimrilim, the Alabaster Staff was \"some four thousand years old or some\" by 1372 DR. by the [[Untheric pantheon]] on their [[Earth|world of origin]]. At some point in the past, the [[archwizard]] [[Hodkamset]] created a replica of the ''Alabaster Staff'', known as the ''[[staff of the necromancer]]'', in hopes of securing a reputation.\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], the ''Alabaster Staff'' was stolen many times by different groups, such as the [[Church of Tiamat]], the bandits of [[Furifax]], and the [[Zhentarim]], but it was recovered by the followers of [[Gilgeam]] led by [[Zimrilim]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, thanks to the help of a thief named [[Kehrsyn]]. Zimrilim used the ''Alabaster Staff'' to raise the preserved body of Gilgeam in order to try to use the undead god as a puppet to rule Unther.\n\nWith the help of the [[Harper]] agent [[Demok]], Kehrsyn was able to steal back the ''Alabaster Staff'' from Zimrilim by exchanging it with a replica made by the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] [[Eileph]]. Kehrsyn later used the ''Alabaster Staff'' to destroy the reanimated Gilgeam, with the help of the [[Tiamat]]an priestess [[Tiglath]]."
