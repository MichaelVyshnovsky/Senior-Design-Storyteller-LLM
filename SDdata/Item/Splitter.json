It also dispelled magic with a successful hit.\nRyld liked to attend to his sword, having convinced himself that the sword (though non-sentient) appreciated it.\nThe greatsword was broken when Jeggred Baenre killed Ryld in 1373 DR.\nSuperior Dispelling A superior dispelling weapon allows the wielder to use dispel magic as a standard action in a 5-foot radius centered on the wielder. The item grants only the use of the area dispel function of the spell, not the targeted dispel or counterspell functions."
