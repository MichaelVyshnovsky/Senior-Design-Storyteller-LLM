The Sorrows Tear was a unique ghostly dagger created out of a ghosts tear by Elytharra Dinnesmore of Targos in the early 14 century DR.
This dagger was a weightless ethereal silver blade. The weapons magic came from the ghostlys tear and the feelings of sorrow and relief that it contained. When the blade landed a stab, it had a chance of transferring the ghosts suffering anguish onto the target. The weapon possessed a +2 enchantment that was especially deadly to incorporeal undead creatures.
In the , the goblin slayers of Targos may have aided Cahl-Hyred, the innkeeper of the Weeping Widow Inn, to aid the establishments namesake. The weeping ghost was the widow Veira who waited for her husband, who perished in Maer Dualdon in years past. When she was shown a piece of Veiras Gaze, the ghost gifted adventurers a single ghostly tear as a thank you. Later, enchantress Elytharra Dinnesmore offered to use the tears magic and shape it into a magical spectral blade.
