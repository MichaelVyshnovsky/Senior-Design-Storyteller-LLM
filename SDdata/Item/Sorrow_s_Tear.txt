The '''''Sorrow's Tear''''' was a unique [[ghost]]ly [[dagger]] created out of a ghost's tear by [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]] of [[Targos]] in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This dagger was a weightless [[ethereal]] [[silver]] blade. The weapon's magic came from the ghostly's tear and the feelings of sorrow and relief that it contained. When the blade landed a stab, it had a chance of transferring the ghost's suffering anguish onto the target. The weapon possessed a ''+2'' [[enchantment]] that was especially deadly to incorporeal [[undead]] creatures.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the [[goblin slayers of Targos]] may have aided [[Cahl-Hyred]], the innkeeper of the [[Weeping Widow Inn]], to aid the establishment's namesake. The weeping ghost was the widow [[Veira]] who waited for her husband, who perished in [[Maer Dualdon]] in years past. When she was shown a piece of ''[[Veira's Gaze]]'', the ghost gifted adventurers a single ghostly tear as a thank you. Later, [[enchantress]] [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]] offered to use the tear's magic and shape it into a magical spectral blade.
