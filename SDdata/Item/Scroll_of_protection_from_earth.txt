'''''Scroll of protection from earth''''' was a [[magic]]al [[scroll]] found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
Reading this scroll created an area of protection centered around the caster, with a diameter of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. It protected the caster from all [[Earth (element)|earth]]-based attacks, as well as natural effects. It offered protection against avalanches, earthquakes, quicksand, sand slides, ''etc''. It also allowed those within the area of protection to walk safely across unstable ground. While the scroll did not protect against physical attacks from [[dao]] or [[earth elemental]]s, it did protect against their earth-based effects.
