This award was reserved for Doves who had defeated a powerful monster without the use of lethal weapons or harmful magic.\nIf a Knight of the Dove earned this award, they were eligible to serve as one of the citys \"Dove Emissaries\", who acted as guides and protectors for Ravenian and foreign diplomats."
