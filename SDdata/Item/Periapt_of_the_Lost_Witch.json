        "mainbody": "The periapt of the Lost Witch was an allegedly unique and palpably evil amulet artifact of unrevealed origins.\nAs some sages speculated, this amulet glowed with sinister magic that carried a part of its previous owners soul. The periapts enchantments made its wearer insusceptible to serious injuries received in combat and granted them significant resistance to spells. But its ill intent became apparent from the spells that the periapt of the Lost Witch granted to the wearer. It allowed for unlimited casting of powerful versions of the bestow curse spell and once per day the avasculate spell, which caused the target to violently evacuate their bodys blood through the skin.\nThe amulets first known owner was Arduelth, a promising young Rashemi wychlaran from the city of Mulsantir. She sought to research the most powerful magics that could be used against Rashemens oldest enemy, Thay. Arduelth left on her dajemma and was gone for several years. When she returned, she bore a glowing periapt and a haunted look in her eyes. She claimed she had learned the secret of creating periapts of the Lost Witch and several other powerful items.\nArduelth persuaded hathrans, despite their doubts, that using periapts of the Lost Witch and other artifacts against Thay would break the Red Wizard nation. Gravely, Arduelth was made a hathran, but soon after, her fellows realized their mistake as the young woman became consumed by unnatural drive, creating more powerful and more evil magical weapons. To stop her madness, Arduelth was executed by being bound and thrown off a seaside cliff in Mulsantir.\nAs of the , Arduelths skeletal remains and glowing periapt of the Lost Witch could be found among rocks of the same cliff where she died. Those who touched the amulet felt determination emanating from within to finish Arduelths plans of enslaving the Red Wizards and their nation."
