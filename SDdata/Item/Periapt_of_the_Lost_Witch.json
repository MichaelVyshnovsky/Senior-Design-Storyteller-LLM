        "mainbody": "The '''''periapt of the Lost Witch''''' was an allegedly unique and palpably evil [[amulet]] [[artifact]] of unrevealed origins.",
        "Powers": "As some sages speculated, this amulet glowed with sinister [[magic]] that carried a part of its previous owner's [[soul]]. The periapt's enchantments made its wearer insusceptible to serious injuries received in combat and granted them significant resistance to spells. But its ill intent became apparent from the spells that the ''periapt of the Lost Witch'' granted to the wearer. It allowed for unlimited casting of powerful versions of the ''[[bestow curse]]'' spell and once per day the ''[[avasculate]]'' spell, which caused the target to violently evacuate their body's blood through the skin.",
        "History": "The amulet's first known owner was [[Arduelth]], a promising young [[Rashemi]] [[wychlaran]] from the city of [[Mulsantir]]. She sought to research the most powerful magics that could be used against Rashemen's oldest enemy, [[Thay]]. Arduelth left on her ''dajemma'' and was gone for several years. When she returned, she bore a glowing ''periapt'' and a haunted look in her eyes. She claimed she had learned the secret of creating ''periapts of the Lost Witch'' and several other powerful items.\n\nArduelth persuaded [[hathran]]s, despite their doubts, that using ''periapts of the Lost Witch'' and other artifacts against Thay would break the [[Red Wizard]] nation. Gravely, Arduelth was made a hathran, but soon after, her fellows realized their mistake as the young woman became consumed by unnatural drive, creating more powerful and more evil magical weapons. To stop her madness, Arduelth was executed by being bound and thrown off a seaside cliff in Mulsantir.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Arduelth's skeletal remains and glowing ''periapt of the Lost Witch'' could be found among rocks of the same cliff where she died. Those who touched the amulet felt determination emanating from within to finish Arduelth's plans of enslaving the Red Wizards and their nation."
