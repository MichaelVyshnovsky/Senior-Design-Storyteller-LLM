        "mainbody": "ah-ree was an ancient abstract strategy board game in Faer√ªn, popular among giants and played even by some of the gods.\nLegends stated that the game of wah-ree was invented by the gods themselves.\nThe myths of the giants state that early in the history of the world, after thousands of years of war between the giants and the dragons, the god of giants, Annam All-Father, made a truce with the god Garyx by agreeing with the dragon god to settle the war with a game of wah-ree. So skilled were the two opponents, that game ended in a stalemate. Because of this result the war came to an end, but the dragons were allowed to keep the territory they had conquered.\nAnother giant legend tells of two verbeegs who played a single game of wah-ree over a 40 year period!"
