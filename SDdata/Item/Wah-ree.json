        "History": "Legends stated that the game of ''wah-ree'' was invented by the gods themselves.\n\nThe myths of the giants state that early in the history of the world, after [[Thousand Year War|thousands of years of war]] between the giants and the [[dragon]]s, the god of giants, [[Annam All-Father]], made a truce with the god [[Garyx]] by agreeing with the dragon god to settle the war with a game of ''wah-ree''. So skilled were the two opponents, that game ended in a stalemate. Because of this result the war came to an end, but the dragons were allowed to keep the territory they had conquered.\n\nAnother giant legend tells of two [[verbeeg]]s who played a single game of ''wah-ree'' over a 40 year period!"
