'''Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger''' was a famous [[gnome|gnomish]] mechanical device invented by [[Gurn]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger was proudly displayed in the [[High House of Wonders]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] next to another famous deviceâ€”[[Baldric's Brilliant Blamblower]]. Both gadgets were considered an inspiration for young gnomish inventors and something to strive for. Young [[Purfbin Doogrick]] once attempted to create an invention he thought to be as grand as Gurn's Great Gnomeflinger. However, his [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]] caused shame and destruction in his family's burrow instead.
