'''''Ubtao's Thorn''''' was a legendary [[enchanted]] [[druid]]ic [[staff]] from the jungles of [[Chult]] created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Magics imbued into ''Ubtao's Thorn'' were inspired by belief of some members of the [[Church of Ubtao]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, that their deity did not leave Chult. Instead, they believed that Ubtao was poisoned via a thorn plunged into his side by [[Dendar]] the Night Serpent, driving the Father of Chult mad. ''Ubtao's Thorn'' possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment and it improved abilities of the weeding druid as well as the druid's allies'.

==Notable Owners==
[[Qawasha]]: a [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]] from [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
