An axe was a single- or double-bladed weapon made from a metal or stone head mounted on a haft of varying length. The haft was usually made of wood to reduce the overall weight. The term "axe" is used here as an archetype of hand-held slashing weapons that fit this description and where the Blade length is considerably less then the overall weapon length.
Axes were the favored weapons of many fighters and barbarians (especially dwarves).
