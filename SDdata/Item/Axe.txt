An '''axe''' was a single- or double-bladed weapon made from a metal or stone head mounted on a haft of varying length. The haft was usually made of wood to reduce the overall weight. The term "axe" is used here as an archetype of hand-held slashing weapons that fit this description and where the [[Blade]] length is considerably less then the overall weapon length.

Axes were the favored weapons of many [[fighter]]s and [[barbarian]]s (especially [[dwarves]]).
