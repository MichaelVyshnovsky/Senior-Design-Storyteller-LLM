        "mainbody": "auntlets of polishing were gauntlets highly prized among metal smiths for their cleaning enchantment. They were considered to be an invaluable asset for the task of cleaning and drying metal armor before it could rust.\nAny individual wearing these gauntlets was capable of cleaning and polishing anything made of metal very thoroughly, in one-tenth of the time that it would normally take to accomplish.\nIn the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff were gifted a pair of gauntlets of polishing alongside many other magical items by Harold Pierre after they brought the lost ship Windfinder back to port."
