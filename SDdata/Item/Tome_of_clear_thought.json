        "mainbody": "A '''''tome of clear thought''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[book]] that contained exercises to supernaturally increase its reader's intelligence.",
        "Description": "''Tomes of clear thought'' were heavy books that contained exercises designed to improve the reader's memory and logical thinking. Contents of these tomes varied. Some contained a selection of esoteric and studious works of literature. Some works involved obscure mathematical or algebraic formulae, or even books that contained information on inter-planar biology.",
        "Powers": "Charged within the book's words was a powerful magical enchantment. If the reader completed the book within a period of 6 days, an activity that required a total of 48 hours of reading, the reader was endowed with a substantial improvement to mental capacities, including the ability to further extend them beyond natural capabilities.\n\nOnce the book was fully read, it spent its magical power and became an ordinary book,. However, the book recharged its power after one century.",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[githyanki]] knight [[Al'chaia]], who led a detachment of githyanki inhabiting [[Stardock]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} owned a ''tome of clear thought'' and a ''[[manual of gainful exercise]]'' that she had falsely promised to share with her most accomplished soldiers.\n* A copy of this book could be found among the magical books kept by the pharaoh [[Martek]] within his [[Citadel of Martek|tomb]].\n* The book-obsessed [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] kept a ''tome'' inside his lair of [[Barrenstone]]."
