The Imaskarran Tome of Death was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to "Death". The Imaskarran Tome of Death detailed the process of creating a ring of protection from a skeleton knuckle and an ettercap silk gland, using the spell improved invisibility.
Eltoora Sarptyl sought, maybe with the help of the Hero of Neverwinter, this tome around Port Llast. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the Hero of Neverwinter. It was in the possession of Quint Jhareg, in the Charwood.
