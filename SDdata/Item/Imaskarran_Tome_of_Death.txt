The '''Imaskarran Tome of Death''' was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to "Death". The Imaskarran Tome of Death detailed the process of creating a [[ring of protection]] from a [[skeleton]] knuckle and an [[ettercap]] silk gland, using the spell ''[[improved invisibility]]''.

[[Eltoora Sarptyl]] sought, maybe with the help of the [[Hero of Neverwinter]], this tome around [[Port Llast]]. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. It was in the possession of Quint Jhareg, in the Charwood.{{cite game/Neverwinter Nights}}
