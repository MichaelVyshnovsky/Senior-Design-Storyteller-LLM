The palm sign amulet was one of a pair of such amulets worn as badges of office by the Sheikhs in the Oasis of the White Palm in Raurin. They were gifted to their ancestors by Martek as part of his prophecy to defeat Khalitharius, they were meant to release Aeraldoth.
When put over the palm of a woman who bore the palm mark, the amulet would reveal a message.
In the presence of Khalitharius, the amulet would rebuke him with a beam of cold, blue light. Otherwise, the amulet might have acted as a ring of fire resistance until Aeraldoth was released.

In that year, an amulet may have been used to drive away Khalitharius after his kidnapping of princess Shadalah. By putting it against her palm, however, the way to release Aeraldoth was revealed.
