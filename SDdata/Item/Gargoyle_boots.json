        "mainbody": "'''''Gargoyle boots''''' were magical footwear that could turn the wearer's skin to stone and rumored to be created using a [[gargoyle]]'s spirit.",
        "Powers": "These magic boots had several enchantments. They improved the user's defense and dodging abilities, improved the wearer's fortitude and made them appear fearless, and more importantly, could be used to turn the user's skin to stone akin to the ''[[stoneskin]]'' spell. Each pair had a limited number of ''stone skin'' charges, and could be used twice a day. When the user was in the stone form, they were immune to backstabbing.",
        "History": "According to legends, these boots were created by a daring [[wizard]] who trapped a [[gargoyle]]'s soul within a pair of fine leather boots. The wizard later fell by the gargoyle's vengeful mate's claws.\n\nMost seers disregarded the legend on account of many pairs of the ''gargoyle boots'' floating around the realms.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Carras]], a smuggler from [[Amkethran]], [[Amn]], who was active ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].\n*[[Elan Garaq]], a [[rakshasa]] who was [[Baeloth]]'s right-hand in his coliseum in the [[Black Pits]]."
