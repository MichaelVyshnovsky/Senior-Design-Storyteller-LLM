'''''Staves of the Moonmaiden''''' were decorated [[quarterstaves]] used by the clergy of [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden of the [[Shattered Sanctum]].

==Description==
''Staves of the Moonmaiden'' were intricately decorated with blue inlays and moon-shaped garnishing.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, some of the ''Staves of the Moonmaiden'' could be found in the ruined temple of Selûne in the [[Western Heartlands]] known as the Shattered Sanctum. The clerics of the temple used these decorated staves in their service to the goddess of the moon, before the temple's ruination at the hands of [[Shar]]'s [[Dark Justiciars]].
