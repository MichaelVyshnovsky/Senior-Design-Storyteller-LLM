A '''''staff of skulls''''' was a [[magic]]al [[staff]] that allowed the wielder to animate the remains of the dead into skeletal [[undead]] creatures and command them as per the [[arcane]]/[[divine]] [[spell]].

==Description==
These staves were typically made of [[ebony]], with the carving of a skull. However, they were also constructed from the femur of a [[giant]] with a polished skull affixed at the end.

==Powers==
Upon uttering the [[command word]] of ''"arise"'', the wielder could cast the spell. ''[[animate dead]]''. They also possessed a charge of ''[[inflict light wounds]]'', and two of the ''[[circle of doom]]'' spell.  About one quarter of these staves had the additional ability to restore wounds as per the spell ''[[cure light wounds]]''.
