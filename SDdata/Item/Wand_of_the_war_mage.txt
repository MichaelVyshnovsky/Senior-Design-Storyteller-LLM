A wand of the war mage was a magical wand that increased the accuracy of its wielders spells.
Certain attack spells cast by the wielder of a wand of the war mage had an increased probability to hit their intended targets. The wand did not otherwise change the spells in any other way.
Several types of wands of the war mage existed, which offered different levels of accuracy improvement.
An unknown gnome spellcaster died in the Bone Brambles in Avernus in possession of a wand of the war mage and a hat of disguise.
