        "mainbody": "Scaletail was the Delzemaeran name for fried snake and lizard meat on a stick. This dish was popular across southern Faerûn in lands that touched the Shining Sea or the Great Sea, but rarely seen farther north than the Calim Desert.\nIn Delzimmer, scaletail was made from the local and plentiful, hand-sized klonthaer and bharang lizards and the somewhat less plentiful but much larger mushroom snake. The heads, tails, and extremities were cut off, the guts removed, and the remainder was flayed and filleted into strips and mounted on skewers. These skewers were either deep fried in spiced oils for immediate consumption, or smoked and dried for trail rations or snacks.\nA full skewer typically cost three copper pieces from a street vendor, while a platter-full of skewers could be had for a silver piece. Use of more exotic reptile meats tripled the price.\nCategoryFood and drink from Delzimmer\nCategoryFood and drink from Southwest Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from South Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from Southeast Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from Faerûn\nCategoryFood and drink from Toril\nCategoryFood and drink\nCategory0-24 gold pieces\ntkjbiud1evmk8o5bbl9r8mrqo1l6oip"
