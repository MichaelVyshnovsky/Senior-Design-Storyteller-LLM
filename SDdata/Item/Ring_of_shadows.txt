The ring of shadows was a type of unique enchanted ring.
This ring was forged from silver and had a very plain appearance.
The enchantment on this ring caused wearers to be far better at hiding in shadows and undetectable by magical means, such as the spells detect invisibility and scrying.
The ring of shadows was created by a group of priests in the Church of Mask, who would lend it out to thieving worshipers of Mask in return for a cut of their earnings as donations. However, one day a thief by the name of Jennick ran off with the ring. The Church hired a group of assassins to track down and kill him, but the thief was never found. Some believed that he had retired in Waterdeep.
In 1281 DR, the ring was found in the possession of a shadow in the tomb of Kresselack.
