The '''''ring of shadows''''' was a type of unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]].

==Description==
This ring was forged from [[silver]] and had a very plain appearance.

==Powers==
The enchantment on this ring caused wearers to be far better at hiding in shadows and undetectable by [[magic]]al means, such as the [[spell]]s ''[[detect invisibility]]'' and ''[[scrying (spell)|scrying]]''.

==History==
The ''ring of shadows'' was created by a group of [[priest]]s in the [[Church of Mask]], who would lend it out to thieving worshipers of [[Mask]] in return for a cut of their earnings as donations. However, one day a thief by the name of [[Jennick]] ran off with the ring. The Church hired a group of assassins to track down and kill him, but the thief was never found. Some believed that he had retired in [[Waterdeep]].

In [[1281 DR]], the ring was found in the possession of a [[shadow]] in the tomb of [[Kresselack]].
