The ring of mothers was a unique elven enchanted ring from ancient Myth Drannor.
This ring was a metal band decorated with images of beasts.
The ring of mothers allowed the wearer to cast charm monster spell at will. The ring had four charges of the spell.
In 1369 DR, the ring of mothers could be found worn by soulless orogs, indoctrinated into serving a greedy dark naga who dwelt within the First Cellars of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. Along with all other treasures, the ring was scavenged from the ancient elven graves.
