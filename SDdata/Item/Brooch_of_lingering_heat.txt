The '''''brooch of lingering heat''''' was one of the artifacts reserved for the [[archmage]] of [[Menzoberranzan]]. It was in the possession of [[Gromph Baenre]].{{timescale}}

It granted the wearer the ability to fill [[Menzoberranzan#Narbondel|Narbondel]] with twenty-four hours of heat, allowing the city's inhabitants to tell time even in the [[Underdark]].
