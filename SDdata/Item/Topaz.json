        "mainbody": "Topaz was a precious stone that occurred in granite deposits, sometimes yielding large, gem-quality crystals.\nTopaz was a very hard, clear gemstone that was usually golden yellow but could be found in shades from yellow to orange and brown. Topaz turned pink or light blue if subjected to high temperatures.\nTopaz stones were considered sacred by followers of Deneir, Horus-Re, and Gaerdal Ironhand&mdashappropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The blue variety of topaz was sacred to followers of Eldath.\nThe bigger-sized gems were a customary gifts on state occasions. For such events, topazes were worked by only the most skilled master gemcutters.\nTopaz was often used to create items that conferred protection from magical effects because topaz took on the hardness of mithral when so enchanted.\nTopaz gems naturally stored healing magic. By casting a healing spell on this gemstone, the topaz could be placed into an open wound where it would release its stored magic and dissipate completely, or it could be powdered and mixed with milk or wine in a mithral vessel (any other substance leeched the magic out of the mixture before it could be consumed). A topaz healing draught tasted cold and sour.\nTopaz was sometimes called the jewel of light because it could extend the duration of faerie fire spells cast upon it for a few days to nearly a month.\nThis versatile gem was also used in the explosive druid spell Sols searing orb."
