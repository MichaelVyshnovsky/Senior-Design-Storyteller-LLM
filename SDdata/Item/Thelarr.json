        "mainbody": "A thelarr was a simple wind instrument cut from a reed. It was considered a rustic longhorn.\nThelarrs made a characteristic buzzing sound due to the dry fibers inside them. They were very simple instruments to construct, so that skilled bards made them to give away to children.\nIf purchased through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, they could be obtained individually or as complete sets that could be played together to form melodies and chords."
