        "mainbody": "The '''''Ky Trencha Ukang''''' was a magical [[staff]] of eldritch power from [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]], separated into five enchanted scroll cases.",
        "History": "The ''Ky Trencha Ukang'' was fashioned by the great [[wu jen]] [[Kixa To'u]] several centuries before [[1357 DR]]. But he came to fear what he had wrought and split the staff apart, transforming it into five magical scroll reels.\n\nFour of these scroll cases became lost over time. For over five centuries, only one was known to still be in existence. This was in the possession of the wu jen [[Yuraka]] of [[Singye]] in [[1357 DR]].",
        "Description": "Separated, the staff appeared as five scroll reels, each in enameled scroll cases.",
        "Powers": {
            "The Staff": "The ''Ky Trencha Ukang'' had a variety of arcane powers. It could be used to cast ''[[bind]]'' and ''[[disguise]]'' at will; ''[[fire enchantment]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]'' each three times a day; ''[[wall of iron]]'' twice a day; and ''[[major creation]]'' only once a day. It could also cast [[Aura (spell)|''aura'']] once a week and ''[[power word, stun|power word: stun]]'' once a month.\n\nHowever, its main power was to cast ''[[call]]'' without the usual restrictions. One who wielded the staff only needed to know the proper name of the person or spirit they called, and did not need to have actually seen them beforehand.\n\nThe ''Ky Trencha Ukang'' had the odd side-effects of causing [[arthritis]] and insomnia. The staff was also intelligent, and evil in nature.",
            "The Scroll Cases": "The scroll cases had the power to rewrite any spent and blank magic parchment stored inside, in effect recreating magical [[scroll]]s. Furthermore, the cases were unbreakable."
        },
        "Reputation": "According to legend, if all five scroll cases were brought back together, the ''Ky Trencha Ukang'' would reform."
