        "mainbody": "he Ky Trencha Ukang was a magical staff of eldritch power from Koryo in Kara-Tur, separated into five enchanted scroll cases.\nThe Ky Trencha Ukang was fashioned by the great wu jen Kixa Tou several centuries before 1357 DR. But he came to fear what he had wrought and split the staff apart, transforming it into five magical scroll reels.\nFour of these scroll cases became lost over time. For over five centuries, only one was known to still be in existence. This was in the possession of the wu jen Yuraka of Singye in 1357 DR.\nSeparated, the staff appeared as five scroll reels, each in enameled scroll cases.\nThe Ky Trencha Ukang had a variety of arcane powers. It could be used to cast bind and disguise at will fire enchantment, polymorph other, and wall of fire each three times a day wall of iron twice a day and major creation only once a day. It could also cast aura once a week and power word stun once a month.\nHowever, its main power was to cast call without the usual restrictions. One who wielded the staff only needed to know the proper name of the person or spirit they called, and did not need to have actually seen them beforehand.\nThe Ky Trencha Ukang had the odd side-effects of causing arthritis and insomnia. The staff was also intelligent, and evil in nature.\nThe scroll cases had the power to rewrite any spent and blank magic parchment stored inside, in effect recreating magical scrolls. Furthermore, the cases were unbreakable.\nAccording to legend, if all five scroll cases were brought back together, the Ky Trencha Ukang would reform."
