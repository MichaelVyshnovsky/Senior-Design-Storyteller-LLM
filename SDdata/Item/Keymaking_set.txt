'''Keymaking sets''' were sets of tools meant to be used in conjunction by [[rogue]]s to replicate borrowed or stolen [[key]]s in leu of picking [[lock (item)|lock]]s.

==Description==
Keymaking sets typically consisted of a variety of key [[wax]] pads or [[mold (item)|mold]]s, [[file]]s, small blades, metal-working instruments, and a small [[oil]]-burning apparatus for use in softening and molding any soft metal being used to make a replica key.

Any skillful thief could make an exact copy of a key after taking a wax imprint of it. However, the process was time consuming and required skillful hands. Even then, the keys produced by these sets were rough in appearance and didn't resemble the work of professional keymakers or [[locksmith]]s.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold complete keymaking sets for 40 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Misti Morgan]], a [[fence]] in [[Ravens Bluff]], kept a keymaking kit among her thief supplies.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|16}}
