        "mainbody": "Cavilers were a lighter variation of the firearms known as arquebuses.\nUnlike other variations of the arquebus, the stock and barrel of a caviler were made of metal, though they still had a matchlock firing mechanism. Those that came from Lantan typically had the symbol of Gond stamped on the butt of their stock.\nCavilers were less damaging than the standard arquebus, but were far more accurate and easier to use on mountedback. They were also sturdy enough to be wielded like a club, but they could be damaged in the process.\nLike other arquebuses they required smokepowder and two hands to use.\nOn the world of Toril, the caviler originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the Time of Troubles, after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder.\nWhen the caviler and other arquebuses first showed up off of Lantan they were considered mere curios, but after five or so years they became increasingly common. With one source being the Smiths Coster trading company, who conducted business with the Lantanna, Waterdhavians, and elsewhere.\nIn the first three years that it was available for purchase outside of Lantan, a caviler cost roughly 4,500 gold pieces. Through the third to fifth year, as the weapon became more common, the cost lowered to 900 gold pieces. Following the fifth year, a caviler on Toril consistently cost around 450 gold pieces."
