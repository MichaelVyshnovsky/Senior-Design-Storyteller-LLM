'''''Birthright''''' was an [[enchanted]] and fancifully embroidered [[bycocket]] hat designed to magically boost the wearer's charisma.
{{quote|''The thing that you poor sods simply cannot grasp is how effortless all this magical hootie-wootie castie-spellsie business is for me!''|A very stupid [[sorcerer]] at a [[wizard]] academy ball.}}

==Powers==
Once adorning a wearer's head, ''Birthright'' magically affected their appearance and charisma, making them more appealing, pleasant, and charming. This magic was especially useful for [[warlock]]s, [[bard]]s, and sorcerers as their command of the ''[[Weave]]'' did not come from their natural wisdom or sharpness of the mind.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Birthright'' was in stock at [[Sorcerous Sundries]], a wizard's shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], where it was sold by the [[Lorroakan|proprietor's]] magical simulacrum or by his [[tiefling]] clerk named [[Rolan]].
