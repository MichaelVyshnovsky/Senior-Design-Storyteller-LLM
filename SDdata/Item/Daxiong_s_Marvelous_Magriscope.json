        "mainbody": "Daxiongs Marvelous Magriscope was one of the enchanted item prototypes created by necromancer Daxiong circa 1372 DR.\nDaxiongs Marvelous Magriscope resembled a magnifying glass with a half-inch thick lens and a decorated frame.\nMarvelous Magriscope could be used as a scrying device and it possessed one-time use magical ability to identify enchanted items. This magic worked via arcane magnification that allowed the user to see up close and distinguish the finest runes or codes the revealed the objects origins.\nDaxiong developed these magical devices sometime circa 1372 DR, as a side project during his obsessive research of zombification rituals. He was ready to gift these items to individuals who provided the necromancer with helpful information for his research. For example, the demon blood could be used as an arcane adhesive to strengthen zombie joints, staving rot, and decay. Such knowledge was precious to Daxiong."
