A '''''chime of exile''''' was a [[magic item]] that allowed its user to cast a more powerful version of the ''[[banishment]]'' [[spell]].

==Description==
The ''chime of exile'' was silver in color, adorned with [[magical]] sigils engraved into its surface.

==Powers==
When holding the chime, the user could cast ''banishment''. This enhanced version of the spell would always succeed in banishing its target, unless the target was very powerful. In such cases, the spell had a chance of failure, similar to casting it normally.

==History==
In the late [[1490 DR|1490s DR]],{{Vecna-time}} a ''chime of exile'' belonging to [[Alustriel Silverhand]] could be found at her sanctum in [[Sigil]].
