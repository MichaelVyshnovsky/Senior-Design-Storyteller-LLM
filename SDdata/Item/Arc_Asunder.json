Additionally, the weapons increased the wielders ability to parry attacks and glowed with blue light, illuminating  around it.\nThese enchanted halberds were thought to have originated from the great wastes of the Anauroch desert. Sages believed that the electricity that enchanted Arc Asunder came from heavy thunderstorms that ravaged the regions air. The original creator likely wanted the weapons to be as dangerous as the Great Sand Sea itself.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Arc Asunder weapons could be found in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North as well as the Market Triangle in Westgate."
