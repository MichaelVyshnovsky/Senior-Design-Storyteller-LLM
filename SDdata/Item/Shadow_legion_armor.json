Some of these armors were recovered after the events that the Thieves were suspected in, however their involvement as well as the ownership of these expensive sets of leather armor were never confirmed.\nBy the late 15 century, these pitch-black leathers found their way into the hands of traders and professional criminals of the Sword Coast the Moonsea regions.\n*Elaith Craulnober during his stay at the Alliance Arms Inn in Port Llast circa the Wailing Death epidemic of 1372 DR."
