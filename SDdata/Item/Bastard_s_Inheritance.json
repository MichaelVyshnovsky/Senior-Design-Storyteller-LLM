        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''Bastard's Inheritance'' have had been in Larethar Gulgrin's hands for some time. The rogue often told stories of how he acquired the blade, but each retailing was a completely different tale. It was unclear if Larethar had memory problems or simply did not want to share the true tale. The dwarf wielded the ''Bastard's Inheritance'' in the late 15{{th}} century DR when he joined the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] against [[balor]] [[Belaphoss]]."
