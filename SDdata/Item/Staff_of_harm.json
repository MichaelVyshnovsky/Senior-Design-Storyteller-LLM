        "Description": "The weapon was a [[quarterstaff]] used for battle. Each end of the weapon was bladed.",
        "Powers": "This staff possessed a powerful ''+3'' enchantment and allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[harm]]'' [[spell]]. The quarterstaff held five charges of the spell. The weapon's magics made it usable only by [[ranger]]s, [[cleric]]s, or [[paladin]]s.",
        "History": "One of the ''staves of harm'' was hidden in the deeper levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] occupied by the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. The staff was hidden in one of the magically trapped ancient crypts and guarded by a ravenous [[zombie lord]]. Another such staff was in possession of House Freth's [[priest]]s of [[Lolth]] who occupied the catacombs. Yet another staff could be found among looted treasures scattered around the floor of the [[dragonkin]] aerie in one of the towers of [[Castle Cormanthor]]."
