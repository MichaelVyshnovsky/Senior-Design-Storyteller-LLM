        "mainbody": "'''''Udlara's tent''''' was an enchanted [[tent]] belonging to [[Udlara Thaerintauhn]].",
        "Description": "On the outside, the tent was dinghy and small.",
        "Powers": "The tent was somewhat similar in power to [[Daern's instant fortress]], though far weaker. It was impossible to cut without powerful [[enchanted]] weapons, impervious to normal weapons or even those of bare enchantment. It was small, but opened into a much larger space; with a command word, it could be made to fold and shrink itself, alongside all its contents, though it could not activate this while there were living beings inside. Finally, no insect could enter it.",
        "History": "Udlara's tent belonged to [[Udlara Thaerintauhn]] in {{yearlink|1368}}."
