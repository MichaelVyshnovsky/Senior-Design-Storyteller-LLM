        "mainbody": "Cayenne pepper was a variety of red pepper found in some areas of Faer√ªn, Zakhara, and Kara-Tur.\nCayenne believed to possess some aphrodisiacal properties and had medicinal use as a stimulant. Wizards used cayenne pepper as a material component to cast the spice spell.\nDried oriental spices, such as cayenne exported out of Shou Lung, could be found on the Sword Coast North and in the panties of Krypthome.\nIn the Vast, cayenne was available in the city of Ravens Bluff. Embrol Sludges Eatery & Shell Shoppe served a specialty stew generously spiced with red peppers, cayenne peppers, laurel, garlic, and saffron.\nInhabitants of the Weeping Desert of the Haunted Lands in Zakhara used cayenne pepper to season a spicy rice dish simmered in coconut milk.\nCayenne was also an ingredient in preparing Kender Stumblenoodles, a dish from the world of Krynn, brought to Toril by some unknown means and prepared by the cok named Kaga from the city of Daggerford in the late 15 century DR.\nCayenne pepper was used by the inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur and was considered a valuable trade commodity there."
