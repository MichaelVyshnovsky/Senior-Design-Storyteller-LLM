        "Powers": "When played, ''Ninthalor's harp'' provided the player and their belongings with the effects of ''[[stoneskin]]'', making even fragile items highly resistant to physical damage. Other creatures were not affected by this ability, even if they come into contact with the harpist.\n\nFurthermore, an invisible, protective force field surrounded the harp and the player's arms, making it extremely difficult for others to physically interfere with the harpist's playing. However, this field did not protect against magical attacks and could be instantly ended by a ''[[silence]]'' spell with a radius of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} or a ''[[hold person]]'' spell cast on the harpist.",
        "History": "''Ninthalor's harp'' originated from the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]]."
