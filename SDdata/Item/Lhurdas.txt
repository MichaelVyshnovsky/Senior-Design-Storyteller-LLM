'''Lhurdas''', also known as '''"the yellow death"''' and '''"Beltyn's Last Drink"''', was an ingested [[poison]] that was usually mixed with [[wine]].

==Description==
Lhurdas itself tasted like a sharp and dry, white-[[grape]] wine. As a poison, that was why it was most often mixed with white wine.

==Effects==
Lhurdas was effective against those of [[elf]], [[human]], or [[orc]] heritage. Ingesting it caused nausea, convulsions, and severe cramping and burning pain as it reacted with the stomach's digestive acids and literally ate away at the internal organs. It took effect in two minutes, and lasted another three. If one survived the initial damage, then they seemed to be immune to its damaging effects for three to twenty-four days thereafter, being discomforted and unable to heal, but not harmed any further. It had no effect on the skin.

==History==
Lhurdas was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as ''[[The Nathlum]]''. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage [[Lethchauntos the Black]], during his time spent with an orc tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage [[Phrandjas]] of [[Port Llast]] and sold to local [[alchemist]]s.
