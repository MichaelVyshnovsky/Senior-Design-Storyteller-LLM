'''''Anhur's lance''''' was a unique melee weapon wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Anhur]], the General of the Gods within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Description==
The weapon was a [[lance]] that Anhur wielded in his right arms.

==Powers==
This weapon carried a powerful ''+5'' [[enchantment]]. In addition to making it easier for Anhur to strike and harm opponents during combat, his lance imparted all of the benefits of a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]'', a ''[[ring of protection]]'', an ''[[amulet of the planes]]'', and a ''[[talisman of pure good]]''. The weapon could also change shape to resemble a large combination of a [[scimitar]] and [[khopesh]].
