Ever-producing rice mortars were wondrous magic items that could create any type of food for the owner.
Ever-producing rice mortars appeared to be mundane sets of rice mortars and mallet.
The magics used to enchant these mortars varied. Most were ensorcelled with quite common enchantments, while few possessed extraordinary power to grant wishes in addition to food creation. In order to activate an ever-producing rice mortar, one needed to just turn the mallet inside the mortar in one direction and in the opposite to deactivate.
Each of the ever-producing rice mortars could create any type of food and make enough to feed up to one hundred people once per day. The chosen food poured out of the mortar as if it were just cooked. Some of the foods that could be generated via these items included but was not limited to rice, buns, sake, candies, tea, and salt.
The wish granting magic of some of the mortars was greatly limited. There were never more than four wishes available, and once all of them were fulfilled, these ever-producing rice mortars could only create food.
Ever-producing rice mortars of both types could be created by a skilled magic item crafter and required the use of the create food and water and wish spells.
