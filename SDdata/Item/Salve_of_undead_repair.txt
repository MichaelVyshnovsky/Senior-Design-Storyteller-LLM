Salve of undead repair was a type of magical concoction used by the necromancer drow of House Freth.
Salve of undead repair was usually kept in small ceramic jars. The salve itself was a goo of green color.
Salve of undead repair was used by drow necromancers to heal and repair hurt and damaged undead shells they controlled. Interestingly enough, the salve worked not only when applied to undead, but also when used on the living. Its unpleasant smell kept most living from actually using it on themselves.
In 1369 DR, some of the salve of undead repair was left on a table in a room full of mohrgs alongside with a pair of gauntlets of necromancy deep in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor in Myth Drannor. The deeper levels were taken over by the drow of House Freth whose necromancers used these items to control the ancient undead in the catacombs.
