'''''Mage shot''''' was a name given to a variety of types of [[magic]]al and alchemical substances that were used as ammunition in [[catapult]]s or other similar siege weapons. They included ceramic pots that were filled with potions or destructive oils or that were otherwise magically enchanted.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

==Description==
The ceramic pots used to store mage shot were notably light and durable. They would seldom shatter when stored or otherwise handled prior to being used in combat.

Mage shot was often used as an offensive weapon aboard [[spelljammer|spelljamming ships]], with several types designed to damage a ship's hull.

==Varieties==
[[Oil of fiery burning]] • [[oil of impact]] • [[shatter shot]] • [[shrapnel shot]] • [[skunk shot]] • [[termite shot]] • [[warp shot]]

==Trivia==
Due to their large size, [[giant]]s were capable of throwing ''mage shot'' as a projectile weapon.
