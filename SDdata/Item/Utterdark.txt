'''Utterdark''', or '''"black Bogbrook water"''' as it was known colloquially, was a [[wine]] made and sold in the town of [[Bogbrook]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

==Description==
Utterdark was described as a black wine rather than a red for its incredibly dark coloration. It had a raw, fiery, and almost salty flavor, but was a potent liquor. Distinctly an acquired taste, it was not a popular wine, though those who enjoyed it did so immensely.

It was sold in ceramic bottles.

==Brewing==
The wine was made by a number of families in Bogbrook using a secret process and secret ingredients that were closely guarded by them. These usually included the juice of berries that grew on their lands and various [[spices]] like crushed mustard seed, giving them distinct flavors. Each family had its own unique recipe and vintages they held to be the best. The vintages made by the [[Jhalonson]]s and [[Ittreer]]s were highly regarded by utterdark fanciers, while the [[Athantal]]s sold one with a recently rediscovered combination of seasonings that was quickly growing in popularity around [[1367 DR]].

==Popularity==
Fans of utterdark could be found in numbers in [[Sembia]] and [[Westgate]], further afield in [[Amn]] and [[Chessenta]], and even as far away as [[Waterdeep]]. It was often used as a marinade to hide the taste of spoiled food, so, along with its potency, it was popular with many ship's quartermasters on the [[Inner Sea]]. Chefs of large kitchens could also make use of it.

Utterdark was the thing that humble Bogbrook was known for. Utterdark wine was sold at the village's own [[Utter Inn]].

==Cost==
Utterdark was a common trade commodity for travelers heading out of Cormyr, as a bottle was worth 2 [[gold piece]]s in Sembia and up to 6 gold pieces in Waterdeep, compared to the 1 gold piece it was sold for in Bogbrook. Traders typically filled a chest or strongbox with bottles wrapped in blankets to prevent breakage.

==History==
In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], the smugglers [[Norry Waywocket]] and [[Coobert Draftworth]] had twenty bottles of stolen utterdark minted in [[1370 DR]]. They stored these in their secret stash in the [[Tomb of Chonis]] in Cormyr.
