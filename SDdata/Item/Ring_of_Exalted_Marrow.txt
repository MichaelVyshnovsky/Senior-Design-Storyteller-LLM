The '''''Ring of Exalted Marrow''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] imbued with powerful [[necromantic]] magics.

==Description==
The ring appeared to be a twisted band of metal that wrapped itself over the wearer's finger, topped with a likeness of a skull with two [[gem]]-inlaid eyes. When someone looked through the ring's loop, they could not see its other side â€“ there was nothing but blackness.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ring could tap into the ''exhort the risen'' enchantment once per day, which acted like the ''[[command undead]]'' [[spell]]. Another magic of the ring that could be activated once per day was its ''ghoulish touch''; when activated, it allowed the wearer to slash at their opponents with deadly [[necrotic]] [[ghoul]] claws that were capable of [[paralyzing]] the targets.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Ring of Exalted Marrow'' was stored in General [[Ketheric Thorm]]'s chest atop of the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
