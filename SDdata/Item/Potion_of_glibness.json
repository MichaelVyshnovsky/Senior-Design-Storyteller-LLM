        "History": "Sometime around [[1367 DR]], an [[Al-Badia]] student at the [[College of Religion and Science]] in [[Qadib]] by the name of [[Aziz al Kajam]] had squandered his study opportunities and abysmally in his courses to the point that he was kicked out. Worried of what his father and tribe would think of him, the young man panicked and before leaving the city stole a ''philter of glibness'' from the college laboratory, one of many minor potions that he had been studying in his course on basic [[magic]]. When he returned to his tribe's home in the [[Furrowed Mountains]] he imbibed this ''philter of glibness'', using its powers to spin an elaborate lie of his natural philosophy teacher [[Hakim ibn Rashad]] having it out for him because of him being an Al-Badian. The ''philter of glibness'' was so effective that it managed to fool both his father, [[Diyab al Kaban]], and his tribe's [[hakima]].{{Cite dungeon/47/The Assassin Within|61}}{{AQ-time}}"
