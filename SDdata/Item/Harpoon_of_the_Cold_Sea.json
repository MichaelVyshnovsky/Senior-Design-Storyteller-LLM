        "mainbody": "he Harpoon of the Cold Sea was a unique melee weapon wielded by the avatar of Ulutiu, the Lord in the Ice.\nThe Harpoon of the Cold Sea was a massive harpoon that required two hands to wield effectively. An ethereal tether was affixed to the harpoons handle.\nThis weapon carried a stout +4 enchantment. Once stuck in a targets flesh, the harpoon would not dislodge until willed to do so by Ulutiu and it allowed the god to yank the target off their feet like a ragdoll. Ulutiu could also cause the harpoon to reappear in his hand at any time if he wished to throw the weapon again."
