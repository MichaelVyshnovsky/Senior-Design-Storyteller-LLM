A lateen was a style of sail used on various ships across Faerûn and Zakhara. Some Zakharans mistakenly believed that this style of sail was unique to ships in the Land of Fate and not found anywhere else on Toril.In the book Golden Voyages, it is stated that lateens are "a style not used in the northern or eastern lands". These lands most likely refer to Faerûn and Kara-Tur respectively. However, instances of lateen sails in Faerûn can be found in numerous other sources both prior to and following this books publication. This could be interpreted as a case of in-universe misinformation, with Zakharans having little exposure to or knowledge of the many Faerûnian ships that do sport lateen sails. Ships that sported a lateen sail were referred to as "lateen-rigged".
Unlike most sails in Faerûn, which took on a rectangular shape,Golden Voyages describes lateens or at least a variant of lateen as not being true triangles, but as having a corner cut off. This would instead refer to what is known as a  settee sail This shape allowed lateens to remain effective at sizes larger than rectangular sails and enabled ships to sail more windward.
In the city of Waterdeep, the Most Diligent League of Sail-makers and Cordwainers sold lateen sails of "standard" dimensions for around 500 to 700 gold pieces, though could lower those prices by thirty percent if several months notice were given. Some Waterdhavians unaffiliated with the guild sold sails for as low as 200 gold pieces, though they carried no guarantees.
The existence of lateens on Toril dated as far back as the Netherese Empire, where they saw some use on small caravels used to sail the Narrow Sea.
