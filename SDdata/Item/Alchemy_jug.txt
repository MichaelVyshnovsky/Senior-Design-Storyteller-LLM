An '''''alchemy jug''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[jug]] that could produce a variety of liquid substances on command.

==Description==
Typical ''alchemy jugs'' were made of [[ceramic]]. They had an apparent capacity of {{SI|1|gal|l|long=yes}} and always made a sloshing sound when shaken, as if they were always filled with liquid.

==Powers==
The jug could produce the following substances: [[acid]], [[ale]], [[honey]], [[mayonnaise]], [[poison]], The amount produced depended on the liquid chosen. Upon speaking the name of the substance, the user could uncork the jug to pour it, at a maximum rate of {{SI|2|gal|l|long=yes}} per minute.

Once an ''alchemy jug'' produced its maximum amount of a given liquid, it could only produce more of it after the next dawn.

==History==
An ''alchemy jug'' was kept within [[Korinn's Keep]], a [[Harper]] stronghold in the late 1490s DR. It was among the many items taken from their villainous enemies.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
