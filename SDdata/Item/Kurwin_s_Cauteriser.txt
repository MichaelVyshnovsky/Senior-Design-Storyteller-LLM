'''''Kurwin's Cauteriser''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] that once belonged to the infamous mortician [[Kurwin]], who committed his depravities sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Cauteriser'' possessed a simple enchantment that heated up the blade, burned the targets with each slash, and had a chance of lighting the target aflame. Its slashes could also lacerate the target, leaving them bleeding.

==History==
The ''Cauteriser'' was the weapon wielded by the mortician Kurwin, who used its magic blade to dissect cadavers. Eventually, the mortician found a bit too much pleasure in dissections and switched to other subjectsâ€”folk who wouldn't be missed. However, Kurwin's crimes came to an end after he targeted a tavern owner of some repute and the mortician was ratted out to the law. Subsequently, ''Kurwin's Cauteriser'' ended up in the paws of the [[kobold]] grave-robber [[Bugthimble]], who desecrated the [[Lower City Graveyard]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
