'''''The Watcher's Guide''''' was an ancient enchanted [[spear]] from the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
The weapon was dulled and weathered by time and the metal had lost its sheen. Despite that, ''The Watcher's Guide'' glowed gently with blue magical radiance. Those who held the spear could feel its old grim yet [[divine]] magic.

==Powers==
The [[magic]]al spear possessed the ''Death's Promise'' [[enchantment]] that, upon each missed strike, activated the ''[[true strike]]'' [[spell]] that increased the wielder's chance of striking the same target.

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was stored in a sarcophagus in an ancient ruined [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|temple]] dedicated to [[Jergal]], within a heavily trapped crypt. The spear's owner was gifted ''The Watcher's Guide'' for his unyielding service and loyalty, both, in life and after death.
