A blackstone rune was a magical token used by shadow fey to transit between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow.
It was a small glossy stone bearing a complex sigil.
A blackstone rune was carved by a spellcaster who knew the plane shift spell and the art of crafting wondrous items.
The token allowed its bearer to travel from the Material Plane to the Plane of Shadow, or the reverse, as with a plane shift spell. They could take only 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) of possessions with them. It functioned only three times.
Shadar-kai weakened by their shadow curse used blackstone runes to take respite in the Plane of Shadow.
