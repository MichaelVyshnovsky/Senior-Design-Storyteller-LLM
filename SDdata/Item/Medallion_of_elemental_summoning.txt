Medallions of elemental summoning were magical items that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These magical items were golden medallions with a stone inset depending on the type of elemental it could summon blue for water, brown for earth, red for fire, and clear for air.
Any type of person could use these medallions to control a powerful elemental for up to one month at a distance of up to half a mile (0.8 km). Detailed instructions needed to be given to the elemental. The medallions could not be used more than five times.
