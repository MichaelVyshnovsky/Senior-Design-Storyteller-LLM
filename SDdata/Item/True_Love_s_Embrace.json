        "mainbody": "'''''True Love's Embrace''''' and '''''True Love's Caress''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[obsidian]] [[ring]]s that protected one wearer from harm at the expense of the other.",
        "Powers": "The wearer of ''True Love's Embrace'' could create a ''[[warding bond]]'' once per day, with its benefits received by the wearer of ''True Love's Caress''. However, the magic could also be activated without the wearer's knowledge by the wearer of ''True Love's Caress''.",
        "History": "Sometime before the town of [[Reithwin]] was consumed by the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow-curse]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR, the pair of rings was used as wedding rings by a [[Sharran]] [[cleric]] named [[Miranda (cleric)|Miranda]] and her unwitting lover. She performed the wedding ceremony herself and gave her new husband ''True Love's Embrace'' the morning before a great battle. As the battle raged, Miranda slew a troop of [[Harper]]s whilst suffering not a scratch. Meanwhile, the cleric's husband found himself bleeding, sporting mysterious wounds, and lost consciousness. When Miranda returned, she tried to convince the groom not to seek medical aid at Reithwin's [[House of Healing]]. Despite her insistence, the man traveled to the hospital the following day. After being examined, the Sisters of the House of Healing recognized the Sharran ring and attempted to send the man home untreated. However, soon after, both newlyweds perished in the shadow-curse that consumed the land. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''True Love's Embrace'' was still worn by the skeletal remains of the husband, found in the House of Healing, and ''True Love's Caress'' was still on the Sharran priestess's dead body."
