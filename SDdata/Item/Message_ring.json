A user spoke a command and could record any message lasting up to 60 seconds. When the command word was repeated, often by someone else, the speakers face appeared on the rings facet, and the message was spoken aloud. A message could be repeated three times before being emptied, upon which time a new message could be created. Command words could be changed by the speaker when creating a new message.\nPrince Tannous al-Assad and his spymaster, Said Firdawsi, made use of these rings with informants within their network of spies in Huzuz,"
