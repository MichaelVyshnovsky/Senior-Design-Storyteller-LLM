A '''spear''' was a simple two-handed melee weapon in the [[pole arm]] family.

==Description==
The straight shafts of spears could be constructed from any rigid material, but were typically made of wood. Their piercing tips could be formed by just sharpening the shaft to a point or by attaching a variety of spearheads made from metal (usually [[iron]], [[bronze]], or steel), stone (such as [[flint]] or [[obsidian]]), [[rock crystal]], [[ivory]], and even [[coral]].

The length of a spear varied from {{SIrange|5|13|ft|long=yes}} or more, though typically their length was in a range of {{SIrange|6|8|ft|long=yes}}. Roughly the size of a [[quarterstaff]], but slightly smaller in diameter.

==Weaponology==
Spears were one of the simplest and oldest weapons in existence. They were typically wielded with two hands, though [[shortspear]]s could be wielded with just one. Spears were usually not intended to be thrown, but could be if necessary.

==Varieties==
;Assegai: A type of spear that was designed for stabbing, rather than throwing. It typically had a shaft measuring {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} and a [[sword]]-like blade that measured {{SI|18|in|long=yes}}.<ref>{{Cite dragon/189/Arms & Armor of Africa|20}} This spearhead design was considered unusual by [[Faer√ªn]]ian standards. One of these spears was held within the personal trophy room of [[Andura]] in [[The Serpent's Tooth]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/19/The Serpent's Tooth|28}}
;[[Longspear]]: Spears that were longer than the length of an average spear, requiring two hands to wield effectively.
;[[Shortspear]]: Spears that were shorter than the length of an average spear.
