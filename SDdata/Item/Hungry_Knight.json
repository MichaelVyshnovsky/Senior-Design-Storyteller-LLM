Despite the appearance, it was a delicious savory dish.\nThe Hungry Knight was a signature dish served at the Singing Sprite inn, alongside Three Crabs and A Trio of Trumpets. The dish sold for 7 gp, though this also included two tallglasses of mead, milk, wine or tankards of ale, as well as plentiful hot buttered bread rolls and biscuits that could sate additional guests."
