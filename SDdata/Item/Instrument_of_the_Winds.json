        "mainbody": "The Instrument of the Winds was a sinister unique enchanted harp of silver strings that produced haunting music.\nThe musician who plucked the strings of this instrument could tap into the instruments magic and summon a powerful elemental swarm. The harp held fifty charges, and each use expended five.\nIt was believed that the Instrument of the Winds trapped the souls of those who played the magic harp. The instruments strings were fashioned out of silver cords that connected the musicians souls to the Prime Material plane. The music produced by this grim instrument was poignant, and the strings maintained their perfect timbre as long as the harp existed.\nThe most renowned owner of the Instrument of the Winds was Alavar whose parents became trapped in the harp, and the young man spent his life trying to free them. By 1373 DR, the instrument passed many hands on the Sword Coast, and eventually, reached the Moonsea region."
