        "mainbody": "'''Star Sapphire''' was a very rare form of [[sapphire]] that exhibited [[wikipedia:en:Asterism (gemology)|asterism]].",
        "Description": "Asterism is a reflective optical effect that highlights a white six-pointed star on the surface of cabochon-cut stones. Star sapphires were more opaque than regular gem-quality [[sapphire]]s. or 1,000 gp depending on market conditions.\n\nStar sapphires were considered sacred by followers of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Deneir]], [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], and [[Luthic]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10, 11, 13}}",
        "Powers": "Star sapphires were often used in making and decorating devices and objects to ward off hostile magic, such as ''[[minor globe of invulnerability|globes of invulnerability]]'', allowing them to be effective against stronger spells. Many spells could be enhanced by adding a star sapphire to the material component. For example, the duration of an ''[[antimagic shell]]'' could be extended for more than two hours beyond the usual time limit.\n\nStar sapphires were considered prized gems among the [[drow]]. They considered it somewhat of a lucky charm for those who could use [[magic]] and a very bold choice for others. It was particularly used by old priestesses. Powerful [[darkmask]]s, the [[specialty priest]]s of the drow deity [[Vhaeraun]], could use black star sapphires to create ''[[dagger of venom|+2 daggers of venom]]''. When they used particularly valuable gems, they could create ''+3 daggers of venom''.",
        "Notable Star Sapphires": "* '''Starym Sapphires''', a set of three star sapphires that were embedded in the hide of [[Shadowfang]] until they fell loose sometime following his transformation into a [[shadowslain]]. Individually they were worth 1,000 [[gold piece]]s, but as a group they were worth 5,000 gp.<ref>"
