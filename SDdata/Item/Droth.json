        "mainbody": "Droth, also known as demons blood, was a magical substance made in the Abyss from the blood of manes and the chitin of derghodemons. Its primary use was to cure blindness when rubbed on the eyes or cure disease when swallowed and stopped all green slime effects. It could also be used to reverse the effects of acid.\nThe taste of droth was described as \"salty and horrible\". It was sticky and black in color.\nIn the late 15 century DR, droth could be found sold by certain Abyssal trade goods merchants. Some of them included Laraethra Arankuil who did business in Westgate, Saerloon, and Urmlaspyr Theregos Balakhwood who peddled his goods in the Heartlands and the Sword Coast and Gaskil Salanter in Cormyr."
