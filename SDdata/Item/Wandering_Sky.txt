The Wandering Sky was a unique legendary enchanted greatsword once wielded by Hreidgar of the Tribe of the Bear with its story often retold by skalds of the Reghedmen.
Simple in its design, the Wandering Sky possessed a +1 enchantment that made its blows stronger and more precise. Additionally, the wielder could channel the great swords magics to cast the doom spell once per day.
The saga of the Wandering Sky was famous among the Reghedmen of the north as a tale of hearth and home, advertising the strength of barbarian spirit. The story of the blade began with the Arakon the Arch-Mages conquest of Icewind Dale, many centuries before the 13 century DR. The stout Reghedmen Tribe of the Bear was among the first to clash with the Arch-Mages legions. The barbarian warriors fought bravely but were overwhelmed. Hreidgar, one of the Tribe of the Bears strongest warriors and hunters, survived the clash after being knocked unconscious. When he came to it, Hreidgar was surrounded by the broken bodies of his tribesmen and ice-cold rain plastering the battlefield. Unable to find his wife and children, Hreidgar followed Arakons legions with only the Wandering Sky greatsword at his side.
Hreidgar subsequently joined the army of the legendary shaman Jerrod, who united barbarian Reghedmen and Uthgardt tribes against Arakon the Arch-Mage. With Jerrods armies, Hreidgar wielded Wandering Sky in countless battles and in the historic clash against Arakons summoned Nine Hells armies. The Wandering Sky howled like the wind, cutting down Hreidgars enemies until Arakons crusade was broken. Yet no signs of Hreidgars family ever surfaced.
The greatsword accompanied Hreidgars search for his missing family for many years following Arakons defeat, across the Reghed Glacier during the Season of Raining Spears, and across the Sea of Moving Ice, with the sea-fairing Tribe of the Great Whale. The Wandering Sky cut down through southern slavers as the barbarian traveled to the town of Enholms Point, where the greatsword was wielded against the armies of Kresselack the Black Wolf. Legends claimed that Hreidgar fought so valiantly that the warlord retreated from Enholms Point and the field of battle after dealing Hreidgar a grave injury.
Skald sang of gravely wounded Hreidgar traveling for many miles with only his greatsword at his side before he collapsed and died of his injuries. With his final ounces of strength and dying breath, the barbarian plunged the sword into ice and uttered, "Let the sky wander, for my travels are done." The next day, good folk from the village of Enholms Point came to claim the heros body, but the Wandering Sky was gone.
Legends said that the Wandering Sky did just that, wandered the skies and found its way into the hands of those embarking on long and dangerous journeys.
Sometime before Mirtul of the , the Wandering Sky found its way to the Gallaway Trade Depot. The greatsword ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading companys store in Targos the same year.
