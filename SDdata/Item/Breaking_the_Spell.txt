'''''Breaking the Spell''''' was one of the books consulted by the [[warlock]] [[Japheth Donard]] during his attempt to recall the soul of [[Anusha Marhana]] and rejoin it with her sleeping body in {{yearlink|1396}}, after it was stolen away by the [[Dreamheart]]. He spent considerable coin renting the tomes from [[Veltalar]]'s private collections.
