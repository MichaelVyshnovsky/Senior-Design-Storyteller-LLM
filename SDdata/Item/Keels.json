These boots had some sentimental value as well as immense pride to their original owner, Calliope. She commissioned these boots, using steel fins salvaged from the ships she sank during her pirating career.\nThe Keels appearance was intimidating enough by itself, but the boots were also imbued with the enchantment similar to a dragons frightful presence. The wearer of the Keels could turn even the bravest warriors to fleeing.\n*Calliope a bard adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.\nVideo Games\nWarriors of Waterdeep\nCategoryItems\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryBoots\nCategoryItems from Waterdeep\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast North\nCategoryClothing\nCategoryMagic clothing\nCategorySteel items\n7soivdoul4xthx26yo6w00z2e8u24sp"
