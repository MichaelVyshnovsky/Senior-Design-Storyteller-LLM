The '''''guidance of Shar''''' was a powerful magical [[holy symbol]] of [[Shar]], found in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The symbol was a simple thin, flat, black [[steel]] disk with a purple border about the edge, forming the common symbol of Shar.

==Powers==
The disk had several effects upon its bearer, even without their devotion to Shar. It passively improved the bearer's force of personality, granted them a ''[[blur]]ring'' effect that made them harder to target, and could temporarily blind enemies in melee. Shar's blessing was double-edged, however, and the bearer of the symbol also found themselves being blinded by Shar's darkness at times.

==History==
Magistrate [[Abella Toth]] granted the symbol as a reward to trustworthy [[adventurer]]s, who had captured the infamous [[Sharran]] priest [[Dedryk Black]] for her.
