'''''Sail burners''''' were ''[[enchanted]]'' [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s used by sailors and pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] and the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Powers==
''Sail burners'' were hard to handle, but the bolts could be helpful in naval combat with enough practice. They burst into flames and torched the opponent vessel's sails when shot from a crossbow.

==History==
''Sail burners'' were in common use in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew and offered the bolts for sale.
