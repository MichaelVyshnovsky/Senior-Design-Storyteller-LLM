        "Powers": "These evil [[mace]]s possess ''+2'' enchantments. Additionally, when goodly creatures touched the weapon, it shocked them with a painful burst of lightning. This made the mace unusable by anyone but evil creatures and effective when wielded against the powers of good. And as the name suggested, these maces allowed the wilder to call on clouds of unnatural ''[[darkness]]''. A typical ''mace of darkness'' had three charges of the spell.",
        "History": "These fearsome spiked bludgeons were popular among [[cleric]]s of evil [[god]]s and similarly aligned warriors throughout the Realms. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] one of these enchanted maces was found in a subterranean burial tombs turned [[Unseen]] warehouse underneath [[Elmwood]] of the [[Moonsea]] region.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a ''mace of darkness'' was wielded by [[Charon (priest)|Charon]] of [[Bane]] from the city of [[Voonlar]]. He carried the mace with him into undead-infested catacombs under the city where he met his doom at the hands of [[banedead]]."
