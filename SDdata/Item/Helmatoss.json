        "mainbody": "'''Helmatoss''' was a type of [[ale]], or \"small beer,\" named after the certain long-dead tavernkeeper named [[Alanra Helmatoss]], who lived some years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Helmatoss was a heavy, sweet, oily, and clear pale ale. Because of its heft and acquired taste, many speculated that the ale's name did not derive from Alanra Helmatoss but from the vomiting it caused in those who over-indulged.\n\n[[Harper]]s discovered that Helmatoss was a beverage with some curative properties. It could neutralize many [[poison]]s and reduce rumbling stomachs' acidity. The beverage was also highly flammable.\n\nHelmatoss was popular among merchants and traders and was found commonly on the Sword Coast, all along the [[Trade Way]], as far north as the city of [[Luskan]]."
