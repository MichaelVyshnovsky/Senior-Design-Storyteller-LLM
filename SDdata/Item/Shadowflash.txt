'''''Shadowflash''''', also called '''''Silverflash''''', was the ''+1 [[silver]] [[short sword]]'' owned by [[Vhaeraun]], the [[drow]] [[deity]] of thievery.

==Description==
''Shadowflash'' was a short sword of gleaming silver.

==Powers==
As the name suggested, ''Shadowflash'' could flash. The intensity of this light was about that of a ''[[continual light]]'' spell. Everyone but Vhaeraun within 70 ft. (21.34 m) who saw this light went blind for two to five minutes

==History==
How Vhaeraun came to own ''Shadowflash'' was unknown. The short sword was his favored weapon. His [[cleric]]s preferred the usage of a short sword too. They often mastered a combat style called ''[[sargh'elgg]]'' with a short sword.{{Cite web
