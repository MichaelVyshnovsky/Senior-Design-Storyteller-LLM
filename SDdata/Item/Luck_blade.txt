A luck blade (or luckblade) was a powerful magical sword that increased its wearers luck by granting a number of benefits.
Any type of sword could be enchanted to become a luck blade. However, shortswords were more common in the pre-Spellplague period.
The wielder of a luck blade enjoyed a number of magical benefits. The blade itself was enchanted to improve its accuracy in combat and conferred an improved resistance to general detrimental effects and misfortunes, magical or otherwise.
Additionally, the blade granted its wielder with the power of good fortune, giving them the ability to turn one immediate bad turn of events into a good one, once per day. The sword regained this ability in the following dawn.
Finally, a luck blade was granted with up to three uses of the wish spell, each of which could also be cast only once a day. Once all the uses were expended, the sword could no longer provide new wishes, but all its other enhancements remained.
