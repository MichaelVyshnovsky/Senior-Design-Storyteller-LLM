'''Taunth''' was a type of a [[nut]]-based dessert enjoyed in [[Ulgarth]], the [[Utter East]], [[Murgh么m]], and [[Durpar]].

==Description==
Taunth was a dish similar to [[Earth]]'s [[Wikipedia:Halva|halva]] and had many similar foods across various southern nations of [[Faer没n]]. The version available in Ulgarth and the Utter East was made with grain starch and [[sugar cane]] syrup, while that found in Murgh么m and Durpar used hard [[honeycomb]]s.
