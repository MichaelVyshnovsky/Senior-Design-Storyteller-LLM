Taunth was a type of a nut-based dessert enjoyed in Ulgarth, the Utter East, Murghôm, and Durpar.
Taunth was a dish similar to Earths halva and had many similar foods across various southern nations of Faerûn. The version available in Ulgarth and the Utter East was made with grain starch and sugar cane syrup, while that found in Murghôm and Durpar used hard honeycombs.
