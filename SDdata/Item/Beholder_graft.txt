'''Beholder grafts''' were pieces or parts of [[beholder]]s that were [[graft]]ed onto another creature.

==Description==
These grafts were developed by bizarre cults who idolized beholders and wished to emulate them. However, beholders believed the practice to be abhorrent, and viewed it as a defilement of their "perfect" forms.

Beholder grafts did not radiate [[magic]] however they conferred protection against [[gas spore]]s, who naturally avoided grafted individuals as they would a [[beholderkin]].

===Creation===
Attaching beholder parts to another creature was a magical rite that was quite painful for the recipient. To implant the graft required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh If implanting or grafting a beholder's eye, the process also required access to the [[spell]](s) that corresponded to the eye's power. The grafts could not be scavenged or removed from a creature without being destroyed.

==Users==
These grafts were created by beholder cultists for implantation into their own members in an effort to attain power. These cults tended to arise among [[human]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, or subterranean creatures such as [[derro]], [[kobold]]s, or [[troglodyte]]s.

==Notable Beholder Grafts==
;Crown of eyes
:Six small eyes were implanted around the circumference of the recipient's skull, conferring limited 360-degree vision.
;Eye stalk
:A beholder's eye stalk was grafted onto the recipient's head and connected to their nervous system. Any given stalk could only produce one kind of beholder eye ray, as determined at the time of grafting.
;Gazing eye
:One of the recipient's eyes was replaced with a beholder's eye that had the innate power to use a few different beholder gaze attacks (''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', or ''[[sleep]]'').
;Plated skin
:Bony plates akin to those of a beholder's were grafted over the recipient's vulnerable areas to provide permanent armor.
;Replacement eye
:One of the recipient's eyes was replaced with a beholder's eye that could produce one kind of beholder eye ray, as determined at the time of grafting.
;Third eye
:An eye was implanted into the middle of the recipient's forehead that acted as a miniaturized version of a beholder's central eye, although it could only be activated three times each day.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Beldar Roaringhorn]], a [[Waterdhavian]] nobleman and member of a group called [[Amalgamation]] during {{Yearlink|1370}}.
* [[Golskyn]], the leader of Amalgamation during 1370 DR.
