Araneth Idogyr acquired the recipe for Old One Eye from a cyclops whom he met, and befriended, during the Goblin Wars of 1358 DR.
Similar to the brews from Calimshan, this brew had a light coloring but a higher alcohol content compared to its northern counterparts. Old One Eye had a red coloration that developed during the brewing process. The aftertaste was decidedly hot due to its secret ingredients.

* Barrel (3 gp)
