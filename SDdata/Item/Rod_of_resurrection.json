        "mainbody": "Rods of resurrection were a legendary type of enchanted rod that could be found in the Realms.\nThe rod of resurrection typically had humanoid faces carved into each of its thicker ends, with jets used for eyes and rubies for lips. Over the slender end of a rod there would be an amethyst bound.\nSome of the rods of resurrection used in Myth Drannor were shaped out of black glass and tipped with a clear tip.\nThis rod allowed its wielder to resurrect the dead, producing an effect similar to the spell resurrection. In earlier ages only clerics could activate the power of these rods and they were incapable of regaining charges.\nFollowing the Spellplague, druids and paladins were also capable of attuning to these rods. In addition, they could now be used to cast heal and they regained a single expended charge each dawn. However, if a rod of resurrections charges were completely used up, there was a small chance that it would disappear in a burst of radiant energy.\nIn the 14 century DR, a rod of resurrection was one of many magic items that the wizard Lhaeo gifted to a group of adventurers after they escaped from the Tower of Ashaba. Around that same time a rod of resurrection laid within the Temple of Torms Coming.\nIn 1359 DR, on behalf of the wizard Flamsterd a weredragon named Shaleen gifted one of these rods alongside many other magical items to a group of adventurers that were fighting the Risen Cult of Bane.\nIn 1369 DR, both the merchants Karthis al-Hezzar and Ribald Barterman had a rod of resurrection for sale in their respective stores. During the same period of time, some of the ancient wands of resurrection were looted from the ruins of Myth Drannor by the Cult of the Dragon members, as well as by friendly traders of the ormyrr tribe that took residence there.\nThese rods could be constructed by using a  branch from a rowan tree that was under the care of a treant. Following the physical construction of a staff, one needed to wrap the root of a mandrake over the bound amethyst, binding it with a cloth soaked in ones own blood, and then wrapping that with silver wires. One then needed a special set of robes, incense, and a structure erected specifically for the enchantment ceremony. Once the ceremony was complete, a command word would issue forth from the mandrake root.\n* Friar Dugald\n* House Aelorothi"
