'''Eldritch cannons''' were a unique magical [[firearm]] utilized by [[Artillerist|artillerists]].

==Creation==
Novice artillerists utilized the tools of woodcarvers and smiths to craft spectacular and volatile variants of eldritch cannon.

==Description==
Functioning as a type of magical ordnance, these were technological conduits of arcane energy that more–or–less resembled oversized firearms. They could deliver destruction in a variety of different ways. These magic-infused bombards varied in size and form, ranging from hand-held devices the size of a [[pistol]] to cannons the height of a [[goblin]] that had to rest on fabricated legs. In function, eldritch cannons could be made to spout a cone of flame, discharge bolts of [[force|force energy]], or a blast of rejuvenating [[Positive energy|positive energy]].

These cannons were highly customizable and could be hand-held in size, or mounted upon stands for additional stability. Types of eldritch cannons included:
* Flamethrower, which projected jets of flame outwards up to {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}.
* Force ballista, which shot out bolts of pure force energy to to a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}.
* Protector, which released a pulse of positive energy that bolstered the life force of allies within a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} radius.

As they continued throughout their careers, artillerists mastered the art of warfare utilizing their arcane cannons. They developed techniques to make their cannons more destructive, implemented self-destruction contingencies, and created fortified defenses of shimmering magical energy. Master artillerists were so adept at their craft that they could crew and maintain two arcane cannons at once.
