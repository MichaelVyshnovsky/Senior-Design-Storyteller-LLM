'''''Daggerford's Defense''''' were magical [[chainmail]]s created in celebration of [[Edwin Daggerford]]'s defeat of the [[devil]] [[Gorgomorz]] ''circa'' [[1270 DR]].

==Powers==
These sets of armor were enchanted to provide additional defense against creatures from outside of the [[Prime Material plane]] and to increase the wearer's resistance to ''[[fear]]'', both magical and mundane.

==History==
Daggerford has had a tumultuous history when it came to the [[devil]]s from the [[Dragonspear Castle]]. These sets of chainmail armor, alongside with a few other items, were created to effectively combat any extra-planar threats that menaced Daggerford. In [[1372 DR]] ''Daggerford's Defense'' could be purchased from [[Derval's Bright Blade]] blacksmith shop of [[Derval Ironeater]]'s.
