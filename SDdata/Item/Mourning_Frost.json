        "mainbody": "The '''''Mourning Frost''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[staff]], created in the [[Grymforge]] of the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "This delicate icy staff radiated cold and made the air around it crackle with magic and frosty wind. The staff of the ''Mourning Frost'' was crafted using icy crystal, icy metal, and a special icy helve. When joined together, the weapon's magic was almost palpably eager to be released after being separated for too long.",
        "Powers": "The ''[[heart of ice]]'' enchantments placed upon the ''Mourning Frost'' added the effects of ''[[Frostbite (spell)|frostbite]]'' when a [[spell]] or a [[cantrip]] was cast on a target. Additionally, when under the effects of the ''heart of ice'', the target suffered additional prolonged magical cold damage over time and suffered even more damage when cold-based spells were cast on the target.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Mourning Frost'' could be crafted by willing individuals using an icy crystal, a chunk of icy metal, and a special icy helve in the hidden Grymforge underneath the [[Western Heartlands]]."
