        "mainbody": "The Mourning Frost was an enchanted staff, created in the Grymforge of the Underdark.\nThis delicate icy staff radiated cold and made the air around it crackle with magic and frosty wind. The staff of the Mourning Frost was crafted using icy crystal, icy metal, and a special icy helve. When joined together, the weapons magic was almost palpably eager to be released after being separated for too long.\nThe heart of ice enchantments placed upon the Mourning Frost added the effects of frostbite when a spell or a cantrip was cast on a target. Additionally, when under the effects of the heart of ice, the target suffered additional prolonged magical cold damage over time and suffered even more damage when cold-based spells were cast on the target.\nAs of the , the Mourning Frost could be crafted by willing individuals using an icy crystal, a chunk of icy metal, and a special icy helve in the hidden Grymforge underneath the Western Heartlands."
