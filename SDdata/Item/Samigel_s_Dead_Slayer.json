Additionally, this club allowed the user to cast the ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell on themselves.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Samigel's Dead Slayer'' was one of the artifacts scavenged from the [[Elven Catacombs]] by the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]]. This enchanted club was deposited in one of the chests in the makeshift prison area used by the drow and their [[Cult of the Dragon]] allies."
