A One Ring was an enchanted ring that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.
This item looked like a common silver ring with some barely visible images engraved on it.
It allowed its user to hide from opponents and avoid their successful attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.
In the late 15 century DR, One Rings could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such items were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon.
