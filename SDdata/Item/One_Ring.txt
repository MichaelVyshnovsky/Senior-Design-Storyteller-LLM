A '''''One Ring''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that likely fell into the possession of several [[adventurer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
This item looked like a common [[silver]] ring with some barely visible images engraved on it.

==Powers==
It allowed its user to hide from opponents and avoid their successful attacks. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''One Rings'' could be found in [[Neverwinter]], [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Mount Hotenow]], and [[Neverwinter Wood]]. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such items were likely found by the [[adventurer]]s that stopped [[Deathsleep]], the [[green dragon]].
