        "mainbody": "Glemp in Granite was a sculpture gifted to the good and humble folk of Gillians Hill by a local sculptor named Yujist Glemp sometime before 1372 DR.\nYujist Glemp was the \"almost famous\" sculptor from Gillians Hill. He created this sculpture as a gift for Gillians Hill, and it was proudly displayed on the hamlets streets. However, the generous gesture rang hollow as the statue bore an uncanny resemblance to the sculptor himself. Eventually, to no ones surprise, an unknown person \"refined\" the sculpture late at night with a hammer and a chisel. Angered, Glemp stormed around the hamlet, trying to find the culprit, albeit unsuccessfully. The sculptor immodestly decided to re-bestow the sculpture on the \"ungrateful peasants,\" as he called them, of Gillians Hill. The new and improved version was to be a gold casting of himself, elevated by an obelisk, \"out of each of their barbarous chisels.\"\nHowever, Yujist Glemp mysteriously disappeared before he had a chance even to start working on the new statue. The defaced sculpture was moved away from the decent folks of Gillians Hill eyesight and into the back of Torleths Treasures, the local antiques and \"junk\" shop. Glemp in Granite, as it came to be known, was still in Torleth Mindulspeers store as of 1372 DR."
