        "mainbody": "'''Baatezu Blood Wine''' was a type of dangerous alcoholic drink found in the [[Abyss]]al city of [[Samora]], on the layer of [[Azzagrat]].",
        "Description": "Baatezu Blood Wine was a rare [[fiend]]ish drink and hard to come by anywhere but Samora. The concoction was deadly to inhabitants of the [[Prime Material plane]] and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ just highly poisonous. Those rare individuals who survived drinking the Baatezu wine went into a roaring drunk stupor and eventually succumbed to being violently ill."
