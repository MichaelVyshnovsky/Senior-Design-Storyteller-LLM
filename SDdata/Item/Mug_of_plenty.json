        "mainbody": "mug of plenty, also known as a tankard of plenty, was a large, magical drinking vessel used for consuming ale and other potent potables.\nWith the proper command word, the mug would fill to the brim with light ale, dark ale, or mead as the user desired. Speaking the word again after emptying the mugs contents rewarded the drinker with free refills, the only apparent limitation on use being equal to the imbibers tolerance level.\nThis was perhaps the most sought after magical object in the Moonshaes.\n* Raggnar Redtooth, owner of the Golden Tankard tavern in Parnast."
