        "mainbody": "A '''''mug of plenty''''', also known as a '''''tankard of plenty''''', was a large, [[magic]]al drinking vessel used for consuming [[ale]] and other potent potables.",
        "Powers": "With the proper command word, the mug would fill to the brim with light ale, dark ale, or [[mead]] as the user desired. Speaking the word again after emptying the mug's contents rewarded the drinker with free refills, the only apparent limitation on use being equal to the imbiber's tolerance level.",
