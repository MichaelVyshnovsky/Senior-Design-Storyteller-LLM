The '''''vest of soul rejuvenation''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[monk]]'s garb from [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]].

==Powers==
The cloth possessed ''defier's rejuvenation'' magics that mended the wearer every time they successfully dodged or shrugged a [[spell]] off. Additionally, the wearer was granted the ability to deal with unarmored counterattacks with the swiftness of a lightning bolt, even if they were untrained in martial arts. Lastly, the ''vest of soul rejuvenation'' possessed a ''+2'' defensive enchantment.

==History==
Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''vest of soul rejuvenation'' was worn by [[Strigga Morkoscavich]], one of three monks of the port city of [[Nyanzaru]], who fought against the [[Headless Serpent, Secret Venom]] gang. The cloth later found its way into the hands of [[Lorroakan]], the proprietor of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
