'''Stuffed toys''', and typically referred to in everyday speech as '''softfurries''',{{Cite web/theedverse/2018-09-27 - Stuffed Toys in the Realms}} were a type of toy [[doll]] with an outer fabric sewn from a textile and stuffed with flexible material.

==Description==
They toys were distinguishable from other dolls mainly by their softness, being made of textile materials such as felt{{Cite organized play/LC/Pure Evil|15}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Will Somebody Please Close That Gate|8}} or felt.

Stuffed toys varied greatly in appearance.{{Cite organized play/LC/Innocent Eyes|7}} [[Cat]]s were among the most popular of animal depictions, whilst stuffed [[bear]]s were uncommon.

==Availability==
[[File:Fabric dolls.jpg|thumb|''Fabric dolls sold by Aurora's.'']]
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold a line of fabric dolls that were imported from various places across [[Faerûn]], such as [[Waterdeep]] and cities around the [[Dragon Sea]], at a price of 3 [[silver piece]]s. These dolls were made from the highest-quality cloth and stuffed with both feathers and felt. This range of dolls consisted of [[Gender and sex|male and female]] [[commoner]]s, non-denominational [[priest]]s, [[rogue]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[warrior]]s, and princes and princesses. The adventurer dolls (those depicting priests, rogues, sorcerers, and warriors) came with soft stuffed weaponry. Special orders could be made to tailor cleric dolls to particular faiths or [[alignment]]s. And by default these dolls were made to resemble [[human]]s, though special orders could be made for ones resembling [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[gnome]]s, or [[halfling]]s.
* Collar The Beast, the oldest attraction at the [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]], offered stuffed animals that could be exchanged for prize tokens. For three tokens they offered small ones, worth a single silver piece, while five tokens could be exchanged for a large one worth around two to five silver pieces.<ref>

However, the brothers charged differently for each type of doll. Commoners, non-denominational priests, rogues, and warriors were sold for 3 silver pieces. Princes and princesses were sold for 4 silver pieces. And sorcerers or sorceresses were sold for 5 silver pieces. For an extra charge of 2 sp, they would tailor their priest dolls to specific religions.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}}
