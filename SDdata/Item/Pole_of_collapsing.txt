A '''''pole of collapsing''''' was a magical [[10-foot pole]].

==Powers==
When a special [[command word]] was spoken, this {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} tall pole was able to telescopically collapse into a rod with a length of {{SIAdj|1|ft|long=yes}}. The weight of the pole was unchanged. The pole was restored to its original length when the individual spoke another command word. If the individual was in a small space, the pole only lengthened as far the width or height of the space.
