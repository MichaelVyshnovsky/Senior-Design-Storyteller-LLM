The [[Precious stones|precious stone]] '''spinel''' was not native to [[North Faerûn]]. Spinels came to the region from traders with the [[Southwest Faerûn|Southwest]] and from visitors to [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Red spinels were said to come from southern desert country, while blue spinels came from the east, and the rare green spinels came from the jungles of [[Chult]] and [[Mhair]]. All types were transparent or translucent and durable. A typical blue specimen had a base value of 500 gp while the red to green shades were valued at around 100 gp.

Red spinels were considered sacred by followers of [[Haela Brightaxe]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The green variety of spinel was sacred to followers of [[Thard Harr]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12, 14}}

==Powers==
If a spinel was crushed in a particular way and then ingested, a spellcasting creature could instantly remember (and recast) the last spell cast.

==Reputation==
Spinel was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they only used those of deep blue color.
