        "Description": "These items looked like medium-sized shields bearing the image of one of the eight [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] gods of Zakhara.",
        "Powers": "If a priest or cleric of the god depicted on the shield's image used the shield, then the shield amplified their ability to turn or command [[undead]]. The shield also granted additional protection.\n\nThe shield only granted additional protection if carried by anyone other than a cleric or priest of the god depicted on the shield's face.",
        "History": "Outside of Zakhara, ''shields of the holy'' were used by the clergy of [[Lathander]] the Morninglord. The First appearance of these shields in the hands of priests of Lathanderites was in the Year of Smoldering Spells, [[1020 DR]]. The ''shields of the holy'' started materializing on the altars of several temples of Lathander across [[Faer√ªn]]. Since then, these shields were used in numerous holy crusades against the undead enemies of the deity. With time, these shields were lost in battle, some were stollen, and by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were more wide spread, found in many places across the [[Sword Coast North]] and the [[Moonsea]] region."
