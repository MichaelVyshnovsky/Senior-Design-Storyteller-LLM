'''Flutter blades''' were commonplace, one-handed melee [[weapon]]s of the [[Underdark]] primarily associated with the [[slyth]]. They were exotic weapons with serrated [[blade]]s able to land critically devastating blows, and particularly notable for the center-mounted hinge and handle with which they could be folded. A folded flutter blade was used to pierce while an unfolded one was used to slash.
