A rod of cats was a magical rod that granted powers associated with felines and thievery.
It was a black wooden staff 7 feet (2.1 meters) in length, with a carved cats head on a knob at one end.
It could be wielded as a +1 quarterstaff. When held, the rod of cats greatly improved the wielders ability to climb, hide, move stealthily, and see in low light conditions.
Once per day, the wielder could use the rod to cast darkness, but only upon the rod. Anyone holding the rod of cats was immune to this spells effects.
There was a hidden compartment in the rod but it was only large enough to hold a scroll or some thieves tools.
Creation of this rod required the spells cats grace, darkness, darkvision, and spider climb.
The rod was worth 25,000 gold pieces.
