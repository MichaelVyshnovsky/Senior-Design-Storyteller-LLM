The ring of reversal was a unique magical ring that had the power to reverse the function of special creature-repelling statuettes.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, the powerful ring was created by Amelior Amanitas. The wizards aim was to stop a Zhentarim plan to send out a horde of creatures in all directions to dominate the Sword Coast to the Moonsea. The Zhents aimed to do this by combining four statuettes that had the power to magically repel the monsters. Only a magical item, the ring of reversal, could reverse the function of the combined power of the statuettes, causing the monsters to be sent back (attracted) to the statuettes. The future Heroes of Ascore placed the ring at the apex of the statuettes, stopping the onslaught of monsters, and were bestowed the aforementioned title.

The ring was highly desired by those of the Kraken Society and the Zhentarim, who would attack its owner on sight.
