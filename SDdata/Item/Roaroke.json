        "mainbody": "Roaroke, also known as Rokeheart, was a popular and highly sought after variety of cheese in the Border Kingdoms.\nQuality Roaroke was a rare commodity as many loved it and tried to acquire it and as such, many inferior cheeses that imitated authentic Roaroke existed. These inferior versions of the cheese by the most part were made in the Border Kingdoms, whilst authentic Rokeheart was imported from elsewhere."
