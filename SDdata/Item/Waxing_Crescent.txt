The '''''Waxing Crescent''''' was a ceremonial [[sword]] used by the [[cleric]]s of [[Sel√ªne]] at [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]], [[Sembia]].

==Description==
The hilt of the sword was curved and forged from shining steel. It was decorated with [[mother-of-pearl]] and [[silver]] and etched with the symbol of a crescent inside a circle. The weapon was a twin to the ''[[Waning Crescent]]''.

==Powers==
The blade could light with silver flame on command.

==Reputation==
The sword was functional but rarely shown outside of ceremonies. It symbolized the office of the priest or priestess responsible for the external affairs of the temple, one of the most honorable positions in the clergy.

==Notable Owners==
The sword was carried by the [[priest]] [[Mifano]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]], who competed with fellow priestess [[Velsinore]] for influence under High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]].
