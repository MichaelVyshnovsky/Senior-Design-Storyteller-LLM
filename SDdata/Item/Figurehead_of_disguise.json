        "mainbody": "A '''''figurehead of disguise''''' was a wooden statue affixed upon a [[spelljammer]] that granted [[magic]]al illusory powers to the [[mage]] at the [[Spelljamming helm|helm]].{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}",
        "Description": "These statues were made from [[cherry|cherry wood]] and adorned with a large [[onyx]]. Unlike other spelljamming figureheads, which were carved in [[humanoid]] form, these took the shape of [[couatl]]. The wings of the statue would wrap around each side of the ship and the tail would dip beneath its prow. Each figurehead granted their ship a unique [[illusion]].",
        "Powers": "When activated by the mage at the spelljammer's helm, ''figureheads of illusion'' could, once per day, create an illusory effect, altering the appearance of the ship. These images could be additional weaponry, larger and more numerous sails and armor or other such deceptive appearances. These illusions were non-functioning, but could be eliminated by contact, the spelljamming mage losing concentration, or upon being dispelled."
