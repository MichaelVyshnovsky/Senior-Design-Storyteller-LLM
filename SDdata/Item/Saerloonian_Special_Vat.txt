Saerloonian Special Vat was a wine exported from Saerloon. It was also sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
This pale red wine contained a wonderful blend of sweet fruit and grains, creating a smooth body that left a tingle on the tongue.

* Hand keg (6 sp)
* Cask (28 sp)
* Barrel (8 gp)
* Butt (23 gp)

It was speculated the "special recipe" for Saerloonian Special was just over half raspberry and strawberry, blended with some grains for a smooth taste and textured body.
