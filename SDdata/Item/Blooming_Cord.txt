The '''''Blooming Cord''''' was an [[artifact]] [[enchanted]] [[belt]] that boosted the wearer's force of personality and mental prowess.

==Description==
The ''Blooming Cord'' was a delicate belt made of a blooming vine that exuded an emboldening aura and a gentle scent.

==Powers==
The belt increased the wearer's damage dealt via lucky and devastating attacks and well as granted them better awareness of their surrounding. It also increased the wearer's charisma and wisdom. The ''Blooming Cord'' was a part of a set that, when used together, boosted the magics of all items in the set: a ''[[staff of flowers]]'', the ''[[Woven Vine]]'', and the ''[[Blooming Cord]]''.

==History==
The ''Blooming Cord'' was among many magical treasures hidden deep within the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]] and its [[Wyllowwood]] level.
