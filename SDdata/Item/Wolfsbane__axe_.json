        "mainbody": "'''''Wolfsbane''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[handaxe]] from [[northwest Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "Despite appearing to be nothing but an ordinary handaxe, ''Wolfsbane'' was lightly etched with runes of power along the axe head that brightened and dimmed seemingly at random. The runes glowed brightly when a beast or an animal was near. Each strike with ''Wolfsbane'' dealt additional damage to beasts, effectively becoming a weapon with a potent ''+2'' enchantment.",
        "History": "The owner of ''Wolfsbane'' lived in shack in the forest along the Trade Way, near the city of [[Luskan]]. The owner perished sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century DR, leaving the magic weapon for the taking."
