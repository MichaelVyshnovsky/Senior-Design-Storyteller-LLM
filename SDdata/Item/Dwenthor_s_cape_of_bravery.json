        "mainbody": "Dwenthors cape of bravery was an enchanted cloak created by a Cormyrean War Wizard named Dwenthor of the Winds sometime before 1372 DR.\nThis cape was enchanted to protect the wearer from normal and magical cold and glowed with blue radiance, illuminating  round it. Additional magics imbued into the cloak significantly enhanced the wearers skills of persuasion.\nDwenthors cape of bravery was enchanted by Dwenthor of the Winds for his young paramour at the time, Xanda Pennywell of Liams Hold. The item was created to protect Xanda from harsh Sword Coast winters. Another reason for the capes enchantment and its name was somewhat selfish. Dwenthor was a deserter and a coward. He hoped that Xanda would be able to convince her lover, using the capes magics, to be brave. However, the romance soon ended after mercenaries hired by War Wizards found Dwenthor and escorted him back to his service to the nation of Cormyr.\nXanda Pennywell held onto the magic item in case she ever needed coin. She still possessed the cape in 1372 DR when she was abducted by a drow vampire Sieronius Dethick, who was planning on using his magical charms to find a wife and with that break the curse that kept him imprisoned underneath Liams Hold. Accounts of the events remained varied some said that Xanda was rescued by the Hero of Daggerford and she offered Dwenthors cape of bravery to the Hero in gratitude."
