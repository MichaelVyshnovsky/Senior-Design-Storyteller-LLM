Faldiss Defender was an enchanted shield that belonged to an elven warrior Faldis of Myth Drannor.
Faldiss Defender was a stout majestic shield made of platinum.
Faldiss Defender was enchanted to give its wearer courage even if they possessed none prior to donning the shield. Additionally, the magic shield increased the users armor, defense, and initiative.
Faldiss Defender accompanied its owner, Faldis throughout his career, leading the elf to the hero status and to being buried with honors inside the Deep Halls of Dwarven Dungeons. Before his demise, Faldis wrote a confession in his diary and hid the shield inside the secret room inside his crypt. This was where the shield remained until 1369 DR.
