{{quote|''... May any who find the shield show more courage than I did.''|Faldis}}

==Description==
''Faldis's Defender'' was a stout majestic shield made of [[platinum]].

==Powers==
''Faldis's Defender'' was enchanted to give its wearer courage even if they possessed none prior to donning the shield. Additionally, the magic shield increased the user's armor, defense, and initiative.

==History==
''Faldis's Defender'' accompanied its owner, Faldis throughout his career, leading the elf to the hero status and to being buried with honors inside the [[Deep Halls]] of Dwarven Dungeons. Before his demise, Faldis wrote a confession in his diary and hid the shield inside the secret room inside his crypt. This was where the shield remained until [[1369 DR]].
