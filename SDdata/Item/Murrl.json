        "mainbody": "Murrl was a type of a nut-based dessert commonplace in Chessenta, the Vilhon Reach, and Var the Golden.\nMurrl was one of many types of nutty desserts found throughout the southern Realms, similar to the Earths [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halva halva]. It was a sweet treat formed out of a ground mix of many types of nuts, a wide array of berries, and sesame. Murrl was known to be resistant to spoilage and could last through most of the year, apart from the hottest periods of time."
