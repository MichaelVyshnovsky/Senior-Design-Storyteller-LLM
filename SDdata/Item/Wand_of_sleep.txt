A '''''wand of sleep''''' was a [[magic item]] that forced targets to fall asleep.

==Description==
These [[wand]]s were made from green [[willow]] vines from the [[Ganathwood]]. They became as hard as stone once enchanted.

==Powers==
Once the [[command word]] was uttered, the wand would emit a beam of energy {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} long that was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} wide at the beginning and widened to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} at the end. Anything caught within this beam would fall asleep for 3â€“12 minutes.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Harkon Lukas]], a one time native of [[Cormyr]], owned a ''wand of sleep''.<ref name ="RGVI-p145">
*[[Ulraunt]], the [[Keeper of the Tomes]] of [[Candlekeep]] owned a ''wand of sleep'' ''circa'' [[1368 DR]].
