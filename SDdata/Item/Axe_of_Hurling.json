After heading down to the lowest level of the temple, they sacrificed a diamond to an enchanted fountain of healing power.\nThey were met by the spirit of the fountain, which told them that the spirit of Dorn Black Axe had awoken, and requested an audience with them.\nDorn retold his story of battling with the drow alongside kin in the Cavern of Cloven Heads. His clan were forced from their home, and he was slain in battle. He urged them to take up his fight, and avenge Clan Black Axe. Here, Dorn bestowed upon the party the magical returning axe, the Axe of Hurling.\nAfter leaving the Temple of Dumathoin, the adventurers went further into the drow territory of the Underdark. They finally reached the city of Menzoberranzan, and cut down many dark elves.\nIsundoun Impaerlath, a dwarven blacksmith from Saerloon, was known for forging these weapons.\n* Spirit of Dorn Black Axe"
