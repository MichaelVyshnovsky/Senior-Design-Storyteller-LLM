The Wrath of Tyr, also known by its original name Tersyus, was a powerful enchanted warhammer and the sibling weapon of the Mercy of Tyr and the Wisdom of Tyr.
Tersyuss enchantments only allowed creatures who served the forces of good to wield this magic hammer. It possessed a +1 enchantment and channeled radiant divine energy into its strikes.
Tersyus, along with its two more powerful siblings hammers, Bythialarus (Wisdom of Tyr) and Ulhaeron (Mercy of Tyr), were forged in  to celebrate the crowning of the Valjevo dynasty in Phlan of the Moonsea. Many centuries later and after the fall of Phlan, these three hammers were unearthed by the Waterdeeps branch of the Church of Tyr. The Tyrran clerics awarded these hammers to the allies of the church who fought to defeat Tyrs enemies.
Sometime before 1374 DR, Tersyus was gifted to Charissa Maernos, a young paladin of Tyr and a member of the Maernos noble family of Waterdeep. The Open Lord Piergeiron the Paladinson was impressed with the young womans triumph over a coven of malicious Malarite druids who were spreading pestilence in the Ardeep Forest. However it was unknown if this story was true.
In 1374 DR, Charissa Maernos wielded the Wrath of Tyr during her pursuit of vengeance agains the Night Masks of Westgate who were responsible for her familys downfall.
