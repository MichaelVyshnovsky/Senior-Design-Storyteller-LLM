        "mainbody": "The '''''clasp of Bron's cloak''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] imbued with defensive magics from the [[Spine of the World]].",
        "Description": "This little talisman was once a clasp of a [[cloak]] but later repurposed to be worn as an [[amulet]].",
        "Powers": "The ''clasp of Bron's cloak'' possessed enchantments that increased the wearer's resistance to slashing, piercing, and various ranged weapons.",
        "History": "This enchanted clasp once belonged to a famously tough [[fighter]], [[Bron Balhon]]. Many thought that its enchantments kept the seemingly unkillable warrior alive through many violent incidents. He reportedly was thought dead over ten times and always returned to everyone's surprise. One such occasion was when Bron was pierced by [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s and tossed into the ocean, only to return one month later to a tavern hundreds of miles away from the place of his \"death\". Historians doubted all the stories about Bron Balhon and believed he met his eventual death fighting [[polar worm]]s on the Spine of the World.\n\nSome time later, by [[1281 DR]], the ''clasp of Bron's cloak'' ended up in the possession of [[Orrick|Orrick the Gray]], who researched magical ''[[mythal]]s'' in his tower just on the edge of [[Kuldahar]] on the Spine of the World."
