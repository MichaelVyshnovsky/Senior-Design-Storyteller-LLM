        "Description": "This three-bladed [[dagger]] had very sharp, thin stone blades—either all of one piece or separate blades mounted on a short wooden handle—that were held projecting between the fingers to look like animal claws. One of these weapons weighed 2 lb (0.9 kg). Because these weapons were special to the tribe, it was very unlikely they would give or sell one, but if one found its way to a market, the typical price was 1 [[gp]].\n\nSome clerics of the Red Tiger tribe could craft magical tiger's claws for their warriors and did so before major conflicts, especially battles with [[orc]]s, their most hated enemy."
