An '''omelet''' was a dish made from beaten and fried [[egg]]s. It could include a variety of fillings.

==Varieties==
In the [[Western Heartlands]] ''circa'' [[1367 DR]], omelets with [[onion]] and/or meat-scrap fillings were served at such places as [[The Wandering Wyvern (Iriaebor)|The Wandering Wyvern]] inn in [[Iriaebor]]. An omelet with [[asparagus]] and spiced river [[fish]] was served at [[Worried Wyvern (Hill's Edge)|The Worried Wyvern]] inn in [[Hill's Edge]]; [[Volo]] said the chef had mastered this dish.

[[Mosstone]]'s posh inn, the [[Stag Triumphant]], served chopped [[bacon]], [[cheese]], and [[sausage]] omelets for morningfeast that went well with chopped [[onion]]s and [[pepper]]s.

In [[Kh么ltar]] by the [[Great Rift]] in the [[Shaar]], omelets made with fried or boiled stock-seasoned vegetables were a common work-time snack among Kh么ltan forge-workers.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|66}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 52 Kh么ltar, Part 3, Third Impressions}} A specific omelet dish here was [[mantara]], which included green vegetables and various diced cheeses.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}<ref>{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Kh么ltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}

In [[Shou Lung]], an omelet garnished with [[gold]] dust was enjoyed by some rich and decadent [[Shou]].

==Notable Omelets==
The sage [[Warthendel the Watcher]] possessed a magical [[skillet]] that could produce a fresh hot omelette, pork pie, or fried fish once every five hours.

A legendary magical omelet was the ''[[omelet of the planes]]''.{{Cite dragon
