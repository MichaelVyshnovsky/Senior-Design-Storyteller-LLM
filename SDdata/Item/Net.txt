A '''net''' was a tool generally intended for [[fish]]ing or hunting, but which was often adapted as a weapon intended for entangling opponents.

==Description==
Nets were webs of woven [[rope]] or cord designed to trap creatures inside them.{{Cite dragon/368/We Who Are About to Die...|65}} They were thus useful for fishing A net was easily three times as effective at catching fish as compared to using a [[fishing rod]] or [[spear]].

==Weaponology==
Nets intended for fighting were often {{SIrange|8|12|feet|long=yes}} in diameter and were fitted with barbs They could generally only be thrown up to about {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} or could be dropped on targets from above.

Nets could also be wielded as melee weapons, and skilled wielders could use them to disrupt, parry, and ensnare foes.{{Cite dragon/368/We Who Are About to Die...|66-67}}

Ensnaring a target in a net was an effective way to limit a foe's mobility, to break a [[spell]]caster's concentration, and left them vulnerable to attack.

Nets were a critical component of underwater combat, allowing wielders to trap a target in order to strike. Larger nets could be used to encircle enemies, while thrown nets were heavily weighted in order to both offset the drag of the water and to more effectively limit an ensnared target's mobility. Nets could also be easily concealed or disguised as seaweed in order to set an ambush.

==Availability==
* [[Nueth's Fine Nets]], a shop in [[Waterdeep]] that specialized in rope and rope-related products such as nets.
* The city of [[Tantras]] was well known for having a number of expert netmakers. A typical rope shop was owned by one or more masters, with six to eight skilled workers and a handful of apprentices in their employ that all worked to ‘weave’ ropes into nets by hand.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/General Facts on Tantras}}

==Notable Nets==
* ''[[Arygantor the Coral Net]]'', a powerful artifact made by [[Nyratiis]] for the aquatic elf rulers and generals of [[Serôs]] in the {{YearlinkName|939}}.
* ''[[Net of entrapment]]'', a net imbued with [[magic]] to make it harder to break.
* ''[[Net of plenty]]'', an enchanted fishing net.
