These special weapons were only used by Holy slayers.\nThese blades were available in sizes ranging from jambiyas to scimitars.\nBlades of forgetfulness did not grant their wielder any additional fighting prowess. A wielder who waved the blade in a figure eight pattern could make anyone viewing the display lose their memories from the past few minutes before the display to the next few minutes after the display. These weapons were especially handy when bypassing guards while on an assassination mission.\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryBlades\nCategoryMagic blades\nCategoryItems\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Zakhara\njenmaeu1wvhg7sdrnvhqt69kqskj5c8"
