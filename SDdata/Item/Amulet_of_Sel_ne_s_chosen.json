        "mainbody": "The '''''amulet of Selûne's chosen''''' was a [[magic]]al [[amulet]] from the ruined temple of [[Selûne]] known as the [[Shattered Sanctum]].",
        "Description": "The ''amulet of Selûne's chosen'' was a string of [[pearl]]s and dark purple [[gem]] stones. The amulet glistened with reflected moonlight even when the [[moon]] was nowhere to be seen.",
        "Powers": "The ''amulet of Selûne's chosen'' possessed potent divine magic that allowed the wearers to cast a unique Selûnite spell, ''[[Selûne's dream]]'', at will. The spell provided healing but could also plunge its target into a deep slumber.",
        "History": "The ''amulet of Selûne's chosen'' belonged to the devotees of Selûne in the temple that housed the entrance to the [[Underdark]], the Shattered Sanctum. The temple was assaulted by [[Shar]]'s [[Dark Justiciars]] and fell into disrepair. In [[1492 DR]], the temple became a stronghold of the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The ''amulet of Selûne's chosen'' was among the treasures of the temple looted by the cultists and hidden within the [[Absolute]]'s treasure room.\n\nDuring the same year, the ''amulet of Selûne's chosen'' was among the powerful enchanted items with a rich concentration of the [[Weave]] strands, sought by [[Gale]], in order to satiate the ravenous orb of [[Netherese]] [[Shadow Weave]] that was part of his being. This condition forced the [[wizard]] to consume [[magical item]]s to stave off disaster."
