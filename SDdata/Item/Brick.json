        "Description": "Brick was an aptly-named [[wheat]] [[bread]] loaf, stuffed with [[mushroom]]s and [[cheddar]], often served with gnomish pale [[ale]]s, such as [[Rockgrit]], [[Stint]], or [[Greentart]]. The loaf was baked until it formed a crunchy shell and served with a portion of white sauce.",
        "History": "Brick was a staple of a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called [[Le PoTeete Café]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The only other highsunfeat alternative on the menu was [[Rosto]], a type of a [[sandwich]]."
