        "mainbody": "he Boiler was the name given to the infamous siege weapon used by the Flaming Fist in defense of the city of Baldurs Gate sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe Boiler was effectively a giant iron cauldron used to pour boiling hot oil on the heads of invaders attempting to scale the walls of Baldurs Gate. However, the weapon was as dangerous for the operators as it was for its targets. The cauldron often rocked back after being emptied, spraying its operators with blistering oil.\nThe Boiler was a gift from the noble family of one of the former Dukes of Baldurs Gate, sometime before 1372 DR. Even though the mechanism became a terror among the Flaming Fist mercenaries, they continued using the deadly machine for fear of offending the noble family of high status. Though multiple attempts to fix the contraption were made, they all were for naught, and the Boiler remained as deadly for the invaders as it was for the defending forces.\nDuring one siege by orcish forces, Sergeant Lukas Oteril saw an opportunity to rid the Fists of the accursed device. The Boiler was emptied several times over the city walls, leaving the defenders without any more oil to use, and Sergeant Oteril ordered the Boiler to be flung onto the heads of the orcs climbing up their makeshift ladders on the walls. As a weapon, the pummeling Boiler did a poor job as more orcs easily replaced the ones crushed by it, but the Flaming Fists were grinning to no end, knowing the accursed machine was no more.\nFollowing the siege, the Boiler disappeared from the battlegrounds. It was said that the chieftain of the invading orcs took the Boiler for himself to be used for cooking. However, later the Boiler resurfaced among many curious items available for sale in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill. How it got there was a mystery, and the Boiler was still in Torleth Mindulspeers store as of 1372 DR."
