        "mainbody": "Venom was an enchanted dagger of drow-make that belonged to Dreydre Freth, who was one of the two leaders of the House Freth operations under Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.\nThe hilt of Venom was shaped and decorated to resemble a snake.\nMisleadingly, the dagger called Venom did not deal poison damage on a successful hit. Instead, the blade of the dagger possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and could expel spider webs when used. If successful, the opponent was restrained and open to further attacks.\nThe drow of House Freth found a way into deep catacombs under Castle Cormanthor in 1369 DR. They used it as an opportunity to outfit an operation to loot ancient elven burial sites for powerful magic, transporting the booty back to Underdark. The operation was led by Greyanna and Dreydre Freth. Eventually a group of heroes sent by Elminster to stop the activities of Cult of the Dragon in the ruined elven city were able to defeat both Freth leaders. Upon Dreydres death, they recovered three powerful enchanted items of drow making Venom, medallion of Lolth, and drow spidersilk armor."
