        "mainbody": "'''''Venom''''' was an enchanted [[dagger]] of [[drow]]-make that belonged to [[Dreydre Freth]], who was one of the two leaders of the [[House Freth]] operations under [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "The hilt of ''Venom'' was shaped and decorated to resemble a [[snake]].",
        "Powers": "Misleadingly, the dagger called ''Venom'' did not deal poison damage on a successful hit. Instead, the blade of the dagger possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and could expel [[spider]] ''[[web]]s'' when used. If successful, the opponent was restrained and open to further attacks.",
        "History": "The drow of House Freth found a way into deep catacombs under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in 1369 DR. They used it as an opportunity to outfit an operation to loot ancient elven burial sites for powerful magic, transporting the booty back to [[Underdark]]. The operation was led by [[Greyanna Freth|Greyanna]] and [[Dreydre Freth]]. Eventually a group of heroes sent by [[Elminster]] to stop the activities of [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruined elven city were able to defeat both Freth leaders. Upon Dreydre's death, they recovered three powerful enchanted items of drow making: ''Venom'', ''[[medallion of Lolth]]'', and ''[[drow spidersilk armor]]''."
