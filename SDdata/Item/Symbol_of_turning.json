        "mainbody": "A symbol of turning was a type of holy symbol that allowed one to cast turn undead as though they were a cleric.\nSymbols of turning allowed any divine spellcaster that could channel divinity to cast the cleric power of turn undead. Any cleric that wielded a symbol of turning could invoke its power in addition to their own uses of turn undead. These symbols also carried a small chance of inflicting radiant energy upon the undead they were used against.\nThese holy symbols ranged from having +1 to +6 enchantments and like any holy symbol they could be used as an implement in casting divine magic.\nAround the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers operating in Tymanther were sent into an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke to recover Melnar, a member of the Gem Assayers Union that had gone missing.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. While exploring a mausoleum in the area that was guarded by a skull enchanted with Skull Watch, the adventurers came across a stone sarcophagus belonging to a Lathanderite named Jagress Dawnlion. Hidden beneath a false bottom in the sarcophagus the adventurers found a number of gold pieces, a +1 amulet of mental resolution, and a +1 symbol of turning."
