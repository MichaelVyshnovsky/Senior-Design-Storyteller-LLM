'''Ambergris''' was a substance extracted from the stomaches of [[whale]]s, It was a precious trade commodity used for creating various aromatics and [[perfume]]s.

==Description==
This gray, waxy, oily and highly flammable substance was secreted by sick whales. In its voluminous fresh form, ambergris was sickeningly yellow

==Availability==
Ambergris was sold thorough [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]], priced at 1 gold piece per {{SI|6|ounce|long=yes}}.

In [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, ambergris could often be found among perfumes, stored in [[silver]] and glass vials, even though it was a scarce substance, imported through the city's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].

The city of [[Velen]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] was a major exporter of various products of the sea, including [[fish]], [[shellfish]], and [[whale]]s. [[Oil]]s, [[pearl]]s, and ambergris were among these trade goods.

The sailors of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] often hunted the intelligent whale [[bard]]s of [[Serôs]] for their ambergris.

==Usage==
* In the land of [[Zakhara]], sheikhs used ambergris and [[musk]] rolled into tiny balls to perfume their palaces and [[tent]]s. In [[Iram]], lavish palaces were perfumed with tiny balls of ambergris, [[incense]], and musk, imbedded in the [[marble]] walls and floors.{{Cite dragon/201/The City of Lofty Pillars|13}}
* [[Duster]] [[elemental vermin]] fed on scents, flowers, and ambergris.

===Magic===
*''[[Cetacean form]]'', the divine spell granted by [[Deep Sashelas]], used a pinch of ambergris and a ''[[holy symbol]]'' as its components.

===Religion===
Deep Sashelas showed his favor to the devotees by blessing them with discovery of ambergris, [[aquamarine]]s, [[Angelar's skin]], and other underwater precious resources.
