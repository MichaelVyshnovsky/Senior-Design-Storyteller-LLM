        "mainbody": "The Highfire Crown was a priceless elven artifact created during an Elven High Magic ritual that cleansed and constructed the mythal over the Elven Court in 714 DR. \nThe crown was a ring of thirteen selukiira seemingly held together by silver- and amber-colored arcane fire which extended up to seven points. \nThe Highfire Crown was a major elven artifact of great power. Since the crown was made of the sentient selukiira of thirteen high mages, it was a source of near-limitless arcane knowledge. The crown would effectively make its wearer a Grand Mage with access to thirteen supplemental high mages, allowing the wielder to cast nearly any high magic ritual alone.\nThe selukiira belonged to the thirteen Selutaar that gave their lives to erect the mythal of the Elven Court in 714 DR and bound their sentience to the gems. The crown had no recorded sightings since that day, having vanished in the light of the dawn the next morning.\nCategoryCrowns\nCategoryItems\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryElven items\nCategoryItems from Myth Drannor\nCategoryItems from Cormanthor\nCategoryItems from North Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nps68kjo77xw3qlr1w9u1vafossl55l4"
