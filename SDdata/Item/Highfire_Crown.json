        "mainbody": "The '''Highfire Crown''' was a priceless [[elven]] artifact created during an [[Elven High Magic]] ritual that cleansed and constructed the [[mythal]] over the [[Elven Court]] in [[714 DR]].",
        "Description": "The crown was a ring of thirteen ''[[selu'kiira]]'' seemingly held together by [[silver]]- and [[amber]]-colored arcane fire which extended up to seven points.",
        "Abilities": "The Highfire Crown was a major elven artifact of great power. Since the crown was made of the sentient ''selu'kiira'' of thirteen [[high mage]]s, it was a source of near-limitless arcane knowledge. The crown would effectively make its wearer a Grand Mage with access to thirteen supplemental high mages, allowing the wielder to cast nearly any high magic ritual alone.",
        "History": "The ''selu'kiira'' belonged to the thirteen ''[[high mage|Selu'taar]]'' that gave their lives to erect the mythal of the Elven Court in 714 DR and bound their sentience to the [[gem]]s. The crown had no recorded sightings since that day, having vanished in the light of the dawn the next morning.",
