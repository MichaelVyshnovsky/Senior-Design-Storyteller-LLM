        "Description": "Orprase was a medium-hard, brittle stone that was either colorless or faintly straw-yellow and found as transparent areas in otherwise uninteresting opaque rock samples. The stone could be facet-cut into small to medium-sized gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "These gems were eagerly sought by followers of Tymora and those that knew their secret. One orprase stone, powdered and mixed into at least 3 oz (90 ml) of wine that had been consecrated to Tymora by a full-fledged priest of that faith, granted extraordinary good luck at resisting one attack or at performing one skill. The benefit occurred on the very next occasion after imbibing the potion, regardless of how long ago it was consumed."
