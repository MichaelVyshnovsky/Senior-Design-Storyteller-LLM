        "Description": "The sound of the bandore was rich and mellow, and it was capable of reaching lower notes than usual citterns which made them good accompanying instruments for quieter voices. Bandores typically had scalloped sides that were said to enrich their sound. They were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
