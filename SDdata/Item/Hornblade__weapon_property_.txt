'''''Hornblade''''' was a magical [[weapon quality]] that allowed a weapon to be comfortably wielded by [[halfling]]s or [[gnome]]s despite not being correctly sized for them.{{cite book/Races of Faerun|171}}

==Description==
The earliest ''hornblade'' weapons were fashioned from real animal horns and antlers, hence their name. While later examples were more conventionally crafted, many were still adorned with pieces of horn or designs reminiscent of horns. The majority were [[short sword]]s and [[longsword]]s with curved blades, and occasionally they were [[spear]]s.

==Ability==
When wielded by a halfling or a gnome, a ''hornblade'' weapon seemed much smaller or lighter than it really was. For example, a [[human]]-sized longsword would normally need to be wielded in two hands by a halfling, but if it had a ''hornblade'' enchantment, it could be wielded in only one hand, but was still a longsword in all other respects. It could be used as normal by a human and members of other larger races.

==Creation==
Along with skill in crafting magical weapons, the creator needed access to the ''[[shrink item]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
The original ''hornblade'' weapons were created by a halfling [[wizard]]—thought to be a [[lightfoot halfling|lightfoot]], given their more common possession of them—to give the hin an edge in battle by letting them wield larger weapons.{{cite book/Races of Faerun|78}} Both halflings and gnomes developed them further.
