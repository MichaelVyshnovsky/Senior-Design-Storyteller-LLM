        "mainbody": "Helms of darkness were enchanted helmets imbued with shadow magic.\nA helm of darkness appeared as nothing more than a mundane helm, but always tarnished, battered, and well-worn. Such helmets appeared weathered even when new. However, they revealed their true appearance when worn. The true helmet was crafted out of blackened silver and steel. An unused helm of darkness was decorated with thirty-six black opal gems embedded along its lower edge, with a great black sapphire at its center.\nA helm of darkness could create a cloud of darkness with an utterance of its command word, which was conveyed to the wearer after donning the helmet. The power of darkness came from its black sapphire, and it held up to ninety-nine charges of the spell. Once the gem was exhausted, it disintegrated into dust.\nIn a similar fashion, each of the embedded opals shielded the wearer from death magic. When an opal absorbed such a deadly spell, it crumbled, saving the wearers life or preventing them losing life force and having their memories and experiences drained. The more potent such draining magic or ability was, the more opals were shattered.\nYet another defensive enchantment of a helm of darkness was its ability to soak in harmful cold, both mundane and magical. However, there was a limit to how much damage such a helm could negate.\nLastly, as long as at least one black opal remained embedded in a helm of darkness, the wearer was immune to fear and panic, as well as was granted the ability to see in the dark. The wearer could also use the helm to cast several spells speak with dead once per day, chill metal thrice per day, and the pass without trace spell at will.\nOnce a helm of darkness lost all of its gems, it became a mundane piece of armor. If someone attempted to remove any of the items gems by force, the helmet was destroyed.\nAn experienced maker of wondrous armor could create a helm of darkness with the use of chill metal, deeper darkness, emotion, pass without trace, negative energy protection, protection from elements, speak with dead, and spell immunity incantations.\n* Terpenzi, the Guardian of Najara, a ha-naga and the first ruler of Najara."
