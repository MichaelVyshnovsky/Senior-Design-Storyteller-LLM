        "Powers": "This item possessed ''[[regenerative]]'' enchantments that made the wearer slowly yet continually heal. Additionally, the wearer of the belt could ''[[summon]]'' five ogres per day that would remain under the summoner's command and disappear seventeen minutes later.",
        "History": "Caldinar the Wily created the ''girdle of ogre blood'' some years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, along with many other magic items to protect himself during adventuring. Caldinar often wore the best and parted ways with it after death when his companions auctioned the girdle off. Eventually, the belt found its way to [[Icewind Dale]] by 1281 DR."
