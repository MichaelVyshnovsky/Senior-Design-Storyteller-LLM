        "mainbody": "pellstars were gems or metal star-shapes within which were stored spells. By touching a spellstar and whispering its command word, their users could release the spells kept inside.\nSpellstars themselves came in two varieties those made of gemstone and those made of metal. The two were identical in function, simply different in appearance and cost. A spellstar made from a gem was flawless and glassy, of either blue or green color, and primarily made using a sapphire or an emerald, respectively. The gems used in this process had to be worth at least 6,000 gp. Conversely, a metal spellstar had to be made from purified steel and have a star-like shape. This steel must also be everbright, protecting the spellstar from oxidation and tarnishing.\nAs each spell within a spellstar was used, the spellstar would itself begin to shrink, melting away until, when the last one was released, it crumbled into an unrecoverable dust. The only way to recharge them was through the use of esoteric spells, and it was believed only three individuals knew the spells necessary Alustriel Silverhand, the High Lady of Silverymoon Sylun√©, the Witch of Shadowdale and Elminster, the Sage of Shadowdale.\nA spellstar served as a spell repository, holding a maximum of four within it. These were of either arcane or divine sources, but not both, and, if being sold, the number of spells contained within each gem or starshape also affected their price. Each spell stored had a unique command word assigned to it, which, if spoken while in contact with the spellstar, then unleashed it. In the moment of casting, the spellstar mentally passed onto the activator all of the spells details, which then allowed the user to direct the magic as if they were casting it themselves. These spells, however, all functioned using the power and ability of the one who stored them in the spellstar initially.    \n* The Tall Ones, Alustriels twelve sons and pegasi-riding agents."
