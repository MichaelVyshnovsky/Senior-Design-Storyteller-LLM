The '''''ring of thunder''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that possessed offensive and defensive properties.

==Description==
This ring's band was made from [[silver]]. The band was engraved with a [[gold]] [[lion]]'s face whose mane was a [[topaz]].

==Powers==
The ''ring of thunder'' was capable of emitting a powerful bolt of lightning that would strike all targets within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the wearer. The bolt of lightning consumed a single charge per use and the ring had 31â€”61 charges.

==History==
This ring was a special gift to a high priest of [[Anhur]] named [[Jurnail]]. It was given by his friends who were priests of [[Thoth]], and the ring was believed to have even been crafted by an incarnation of Thoth.
