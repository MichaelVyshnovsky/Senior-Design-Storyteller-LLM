        "mainbody": "'''Astral diamonds''' (abbreviated \"'''ad'''\") were tiny, glowing [[crystal]]s that were used as [[currency]] on [[planes of existence]] with commercial economies in the [[World Axis cosmology]]. On [[Toril]], they were regarded as valuable [[gemstone]]s.",
        "Description": "Astral diamonds were clear, faceted gemstones that glowed with a faint silver light. As currency, a standard astral diamond weighed 1/500{{th}} of a pound (0.9 grams)&mdash;a tenth as much as a [[gold piece]]&mdash;and was worth the equivalent of 10,000 [[gp]]. They were often traded in sets of 5 or 10 linked together in [[silver]] or [[mithral]] settings, and were used for large transactions in markets across both the [[Astral Sea]] and the [[Elemental Chaos]], including in [[Sigil]] and the [[City of Brass]].\n\nAstral diamonds could also be used as decorative elements (e.g., as [[jewelry]] or set into items and to craft [[lens]]es.{{Cite adventurers league/Against the Machine|4}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/At the Foot of the Lighthouse|21}}",
        "History": "Astral diamonds occurred within [[astral dominion]]s, and in particular, they tended to be found in dominions that were inhabited and lively. Mining operations attracted great interest, and abandoned mines often became home to deadly occupants. The richest veins were said to be in places like [[Mount Celestia]].\n\nThe [[Nar]] were known to craft [[steel]] \"death masks\" studded with astral diamonds.\n\n[[Xorvintroth]]ian [[artificer]]s created devices that used lenses made of astral diamond.{{Cite adventurers league/Against the Machine|13,15}} They were used to charge and to disable [[Far Realm batteries]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], astral diamond had been used to create the [[Fang Light]], a [[magical]] and eternal beacon that helped to guide [[ship]]s through the reefs and shoals off the west coast of [[Aglarond]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Amaunator]], [[god]] of the [[sun]], once possessed an [[oak]]en [[staff]] with a base inlaid with astral diamonds and topped with a massive astral diamond in the shape of a sun.\n* [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] kept a collection of smaller astral diamonds in a secret treasure compartment behind his [[throne]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|22}}"
