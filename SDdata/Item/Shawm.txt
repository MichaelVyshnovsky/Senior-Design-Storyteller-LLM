A '''shawm'''{{Cite dragon/202/Magic to a Different Beat}} or '''shaum''' was a double-reed instrument similar to an [[oboe]]. It was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Its sound was loud, shrill and buzzing. If played well, the sound of a shawm was clear and melancholic, reminiscent of migrating geese.

Shawms were common among [[gnome]]s of [[Faer√ªn]], They were also used in [[Zakhara]].

==Notable Users==
* The [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] storehouse in [[Ravens Bluff]] had a variety of shawms in their instruments collection.{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|16}}
