Presios dagger was an enchanted Talonite weapon wielded by Presio, the necromancer-cleric of Talona in 1281 DR.
Presios dagger was enchanted to keep a keen edge, giving it an equivalent of a +2 enchantment. It was also magically infused with poison that continued damaging its targets following a successful strike.
Presios dagger was a ceremonial weapon of the Talonite faith, given to Presio by her church sometime before 1281 DR after attaining the rank of the Most Debilitating Holiness. The daggers ceremonial nature was obvious, considering Presios denomination did not allow her to use bladed weapons.
In 1281 DR, Presios dagger was in its mistress possession during her time in the Dragons Eye, Spine of the World, working for Yxunomei, to destroy Kuldahar and conquer Icewind Dale. After Presios death, the dagger was picked up by the heroes of Icewind Dale.
