'''''Presio's dagger''''' was an enchanted [[talona|Talonite]] weapon wielded by [[Presio]], the [[necromancer]]-[[cleric]] of Talona in [[1281 DR]].

==Powers==
''Presio's dagger'' was enchanted to keep a keen edge, giving it an equivalent of a ''+2'' enchantment. It was also magically infused with [[poison]] that continued damaging its targets following a successful strike.

==History==
''Presio's dagger'' was a ceremonial weapon of the Talonite faith, given to Presio by her church sometime before 1281 DR after attaining the rank of the Most Debilitating Holiness. The dagger's ceremonial nature was obvious, considering Presio's denomination did not allow her to use bladed weapons.

In 1281 DR, ''Presio's dagger'' was in its mistress' possession during her time in the [[Dragon's Eye]], [[Spine of the World]], working for [[Yxunomei]], to destroy [[Kuldahar]] and conquer [[Icewind Dale]]. After Presio's death, the dagger was picked up by the heroes of Icewind Dale.
