'''''Alacrity''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[rapier]] of unknown origins found on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Alacrity'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that made the blade deadlier and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. Its magics also boosted the wielder's intelligence and made it easier to defend oneself in combat, making it perfect for both [[wizard]]s and [[swashbuckler]]s.

==History==
The exact origins of the rapier were unknown. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one such blade was found in the town of [[Port Llast]], sold by [[Haljal]] to the friends of the [[Church of Waukeen]].
