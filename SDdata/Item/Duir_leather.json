        "mainbody": "uir leather referred to any leather, or leather item, crafted in Duirtanal.\nThe unique processes required to produce duir leather were known only to the guild masters of Duirtanal.\nDuir leather was tougher, softer, and more durable than any other leather found on Toril. This greatly affected the price of an item crafted from duir leather. Depending on the item, the price was 2-20 times more expensive than comparable leather items.\nLeather armor made from duir leather offered greater protection while being lighter and more comfortable than regular leather armor."
