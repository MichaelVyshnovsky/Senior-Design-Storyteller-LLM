Plate spinners were tools in the Realms popular among bards and performers who used them to dazzle crowds with balancing tricks.
A plate spinner consisted of a peg and special wooden plates that would not break.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 3 copper pieces per peg, 2 silver piece per plate, and 1 silver piece for a stand that could hold up to four spinning plates.
* Plate spinners were favored by bards.
