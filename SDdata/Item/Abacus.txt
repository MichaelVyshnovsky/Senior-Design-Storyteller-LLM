Abacuses were a type of tool for performing mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was not possible to perform complex equations upon them.
An abacus consisted of a rectangular, wooden frame that typically measured around  by  across. Inside these frames were several heavy wires, tightly strung parallel to one another. Strung on each of these wires were typically ten wooden balls. By manipulating these balls, a user could perform simple mathematical operations.
