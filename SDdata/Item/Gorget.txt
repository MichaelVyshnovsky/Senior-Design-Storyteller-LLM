A gorget consisted of two semicircular metal plates that overlapped, encircling the wearer's neck, and were held in place with either a metal pin or leather straps. Some gorgets had spikes added to them for offense or intimidation, while others meant for ornamentation might be inset with [[gemstone]]s.
