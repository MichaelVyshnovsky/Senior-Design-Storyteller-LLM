        "mainbody": "A gloaming philter was a dangerous thrown negative energy weapon.\nThe philter was a twice-enchanted glass flask that contained pure water from a Shadowfell spring. When thrown, it would shatter and spray the area with the liquid, afflicting victims with negative energy and draining their life force.\nThe Cult of the Dragon forces in Thunderholme that followed Aurgloroasa created a number of these philters in the 1480s DR."
