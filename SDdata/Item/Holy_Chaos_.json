        "mainbody": "'''Holy Chaos!''' was a lesser-known card game, popular among [[priest]]s of chaotic-aligned [[deities]]. Befitting the nature of chaotic deities, the rules to this game were complex and annually revised in edicts issued by the [[Church of Beshaba]].",
        "Description": "This game featured four suits of cards: Black Bessies, Joy Bringers, Smiling Ladies, and Storm Queens. These represented the deities [[Beshaba]], [[Lliira]], [[Tymora]], and [[Umberlee]], respectively.",
        "Powers": "The cards of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] versions of these decks would each cast one random [[spell]], but it would always target the wielder and be of a beneficial nature.",
        "History": "Tournaments for this game were known to be held annually. The winners of these tournaments would receive enchanted versions of these decks that could cast spells.",
        "Reputation": "This game was considered especially popular among the clergy of Tymora and Umberlee. However, it was often hated by the clergy of lawful deities, particularly by the [[Church of Helm]] and [[Church of Tyr]]."
