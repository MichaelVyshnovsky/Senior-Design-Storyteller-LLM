The blazing sun was a magical crystal orb held by the Cult of the Dragon in the midâ€“1480s DR.
The orb was carved from crystal, and emblazoned with a symbol of Amaunator.
The blazing sun protected the holder from elemental threats such as heat, cold, acids, and shocks, and greatly improved the power of light, positive energy, alignment-based spells while also improving the holders concentration and thoughtfulness.
The orb was taken from the Cult of the Dragon by Harper agents, who assaulted their safehouse in the hopes of capturing the White Dragon Mask.
