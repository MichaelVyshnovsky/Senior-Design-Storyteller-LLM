        "mainbody": "An '''eclipsed moon''' was a coin minted by the city of [[Silverymoon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIt was crafted by stamping a standard shining blue [[electrum]] [[Moon (coin)|moon]] together with a darker silver wedge to complete a round coin. In the late [[1480 DR|1480s]] and early [[1490 DR|1490s DR]], the eclipsed moon was valued at 5 unicorns ([[platinum]] pieces) in Silverymoon, or 2 unicorns elsewhere."
