        "mainbody": "A '''''belt of fire giant strength''''', also referred to as a '''''girdle of fire giant strength''''', was one of six varieties of ''[[belt of giant strength|belts of giant strength]]''. It conferred its wearer with the strength of a [[fire giant]].",
        "Description": "At least some of these belts were crafted from the beard hair of fire giants.",
        "Powers": "The belt magically granted physical strength equivalent to that of a fire giant to its attuned wearer. If the wearer already possessed or exceeded such strength, the belt had no effect.",
        "Notable Owners": "The [[minotaur]] [[Torogar Steelfist]], who served in [[Avernus]] as [[Arkhan]]'s bodyguard, wore a ''belt of fire giant strength''.\n\nQuite fittingly, the fire giant [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Yaga-Shura]] kept a ''girdle of fire giant strength'' in the lair beneath his [[Yaga-Shura's Keep|keep]] in the [[Marching Mountains]]."
