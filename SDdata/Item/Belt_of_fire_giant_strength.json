        "mainbody": "A belt of fire giant strength, also referred to as a girdle of fire giant strength, was one of six varieties of belts of giant strength. It conferred its wearer with the strength of a fire giant.\nAt least some of these belts were crafted from the beard hair of fire giants.\nThe belt magically granted physical strength equivalent to that of a fire giant to its attuned wearer. If the wearer already possessed or exceeded such strength, the belt had no effect.\nThe minotaur Torogar Steelfist, who served in Avernus as Arkhans bodyguard, wore a belt of fire giant strength.\nQuite fittingly, the fire giant Bhaalspawn Yaga-Shura kept a girdle of fire giant strength in the lair beneath his keep in the Marching Mountains."
