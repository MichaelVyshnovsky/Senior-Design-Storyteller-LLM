Masks of persuasion were enchanted helmets created by the followers of Vhaeraun circa the midâ€“14 century DR.
These masks were created with two power levels, the regular masks of persuasion and greater masks of persuasion. Their enchantments increased the wearers charisma and concentration and enhanced their persuasion skills. Additionally, the masks radiated dim yellow light.
The secret of creating the masks of persuasion was given by the drow god Vhaeraun to his devotees. These enchanted items were invaluable in the Vhaeraunites rivalry with the Church of Mask. By 1372 DR, these masks found their way into wider use and could be found in possession of spies, thieves, and lucrative merchants along the Sword Coast.
