        "Uses": "Glass cutters were a viable option for thieves wishing to ignore the time-consuming task of getting through a locked window.\n\nA diamond-tipped cutting edge attached to an adjustable arm was attached to a suction cup, allowing for circular cuts of various sizes to be made upon a window pane. After making the cut a simple tap would remove the section of window while the suction cup kept the glass from shattering and making a loud noise."
