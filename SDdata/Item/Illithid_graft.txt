Illithid grafts referred to special flesh and body parts that were grafted onto a living creature by illithids (mind flayers).
These grafts came in two kinds illithid flesh that was melded onto other creatures, Horribly transformed thralls were a common sight in illithid settlements.
Illithid grafts were neither magical nor psionic.
Attaching illithid parts to another creature required familiarity with medicine and specialized knowledge of how to graft flesh. The illithids of Faer√ªns Underdark were known to treat the macabre practice of grafting as an artform,
Illithid grafting techniques were not related to ceremorphosis.
Some scholars believed that the illithids were the very first to develop techniques for grafting flesh to another creature, although others argued that they had more likely learned the secrets from a fiend of corruption.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Black Spear tribe of kobolds had struck a pact with the illithids of ChChitl that included "gifts" of illithid grafts. By , the kobolds served as scouts in the environs around Waterdeep, and their grafts were inching them closer and closer toward becoming thralls.
