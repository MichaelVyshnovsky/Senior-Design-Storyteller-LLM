        "mainbody": "Sword canes were a type of concealed weapon common in urban settings.\nThese canes appeared to be expensive and well-crafted walking sticks with shafts made of some type of hardwood, usually hickory or oak. Concealed within this shaft would be a long, stiletto-like blade whose hilt acted as the canes handle. These hilts were typically made of gold, ivory, or silver.\n* Alamathers by the Water, a weapon shop in Berdusk that specialized in the unique and rare, was known to carry sword canes.\n* Cane of the upper class, an enchanted swordcane befitting nobility.\n* These weapons were favored by aristocrats and noblemen. Those with a silver blade were especially popular in areas with lycanthropes or undead.\n* Dorgar Adarbrent often carried a sword cane with him.\n* Dunstan Balathorp, the head of the Ravenian noble house Balathorp in the 14 century DR, owned a gilded ebony swordstick.\n* Rictavio carried a silvered sword cane wherever he went.\nA several hundred years prior to the 14 century DR, these became quite popular among high society in the Turmish city of Alaghôn. They were ornate and adorned with ivory, gems, feathers, and ornate metal finecastings.\nBy the mid-14 century DR, only a few members of high society in Alagôn still clung to this fashion, with many of their previous owners having had the canes buried with them. Around that time they were also beginning to become of interest to noblemen and thieves in Sembia."
