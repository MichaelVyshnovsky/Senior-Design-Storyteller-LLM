The seal of tranquility was a unique enchanted disk crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Joppa in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
Silverhand crafted the seal to represent Joppas monkish discipline.
The disk was light enough to float, and could neutralize rough waters.
In combat, it had a similarly calming effect on the spirits of Joppas enemies, making them much more likely to make mistakes.
* Joppa, a human monk to whom Silverhand also gifted the harpoon of sudden stillness.
