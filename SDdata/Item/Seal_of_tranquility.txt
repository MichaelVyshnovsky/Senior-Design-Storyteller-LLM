The '''''seal of tranquility''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] disk crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Joppa]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Silverhand crafted the ''seal'' to represent Joppa's [[monk]]ish discipline.

==Powers==
The disk was light enough to float, and could neutralize rough waters.

In combat, it had a similarly calming effect on the spirits of Joppa's enemies, making them much more likely to make mistakes.

==Notable Owners==
* Joppa, a [[human]] monk to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[harpoon of sudden stillness]]''.
