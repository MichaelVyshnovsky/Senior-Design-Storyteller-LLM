        "Powers": "It was a ''+3 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[Bane (property)|drow bane]] [[longsword]]'' fashioned of [[mithral]].\n\nThe sword harmed [[evil]] creatures who dared grasp it, weakening them until they set it down.",
        "History": "The sword was thousands of years old by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was made by an [[elf]] worshiper of [[Sehanine Moonbow]] named [[Datharian Mistwatcher]] when his home city was destroyed by the [[drow]]. Soon after, Datharian was slain in battle against an army of [[drider]]s, and the sword passed into other hands.\n\nThe sword later fell into the hands of a female elf known only as the [[Stargazer]], and she slew hundreds of drow with it over her lifetime. When she realized her sister had been killed in the [[Battle of Nine Arrows]], she died of grief, whereupon another elf, a young archer, picked up the sword and left before approaching drow reinforcements could claim it.\n\n''One Thousand Broken Dreams'' came into the possession of many different elves since then, typically once every few centuries, before disappearing again.",
        "Legend": "There was a rumor that if the longsword was ever drawn by a [[good]] drow, it would shatter into a thousand [[moonstone]]s (each worth around 50 [[gp]]). Furthermore, if true, these stones could each be used to cast ''[[atonement]]'' on a drow and thus redeem them."
