'''Dwarven plate mail''' was a special form of [[plate mail]] forged for, and wore exlusively by, [[dwarves]].

==Description==
Dwarven plate mail was thick and cumbersome when compared to regular plate mail or [[elf|elven]] variations, but offered more protection to its wearer on a level with full [[plate armor]]. It was usually made from black [[iron]]. Though smaller in stature when compared to [[human]] and elven plate mail, dwarven plate mail often weighed the same because of the extra material used in its construction.

==History==
[[Norothor]], who were [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Deep Duerra]], often wore dwarven plate mail.
