'''''Demon's Spite''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite [[Blood War]].

==Powers==
''Demon's Spite'' had a certain malicious aura about it, and it inspired a twinge of its ill-nature in anyone who even dared to gaze at the weapon. The sword possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and had a good chance of infecting its targets with ''[[demon fever]]''. The magics held within the sword made it only usable by creatures that followed the path of evil and destruction.

==History==
''Demon's Spite'' was created alongside its sister blade, the ''[[Devil's Guile]]'', and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some believed that the short sword was forged in the [[Abyss]], but it was likely mere speculation, based on the ''Demon's Spite's'' malicious magics. For a long time, the weapon was considered just a legend until it resurfaced in [[Westgate]] in the hands of the city's ruling merchant council member. The sword had spent a couple of years with the councilman until a well-publicized burglary. Subsequently, ''Demon's Spite'' occasionally appeared in local rumors, claiming its use by Westgate's criminal underbelly.

''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, both swords were wielded by [[Rinara]] of Westgate, an ex-member of the [[Night Masks]]. She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the [[vampire]]s who took over the organization several years prior.
