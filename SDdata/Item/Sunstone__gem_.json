        "mainbody": "'''Sunstone''', also known as '''[[wikipedia:en:oligoclase|oligoclase]]''',  was a [[feldspar]] [[gem]] closely related to [[moonstone]].",
        "Description": "The most common variety of this [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was soft and only able to be cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]], but it did occur in a colorless or slightly greenish variety that was [[wikipedia:facet|facet]] grade. Cabochons of sunstone were rarely more than three-quarters of an inch (2 cm) in diameter and had glittering red or orange inclusions that were suspended in a nearly colorless matrix, giving the overall stone a warm golden or reddish brown hue. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.\n\nSunstones were considered sacred by followers of [[Horus-Re]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12, 13}}",
        "Powers": "Sunstones could be made into [[talisman]]s, usually in the form of jewelry, that acted on [[undead]] just like full [[sunlight]]. A sunstone talisman had to be charged by being left in full sun for at least one day (about six hours of continuous exposure). Thereafter, the talisman could be worn and would remain dormant until the wearer was successfully attacked (physically touched) by an undead creature. If the undead attacker was affected by sunlight, it would:\n* recoil in fear or pain for a few minutes\n* be easier to hit as it turned away from the talisman\n* be unable to use abilities such as [[regenerate|regeneration]], [[energy drain]], chilling touch, etc.\nUndead not harmed by light ([[skeleton]]s, [[mummy|mummies]], and [[lich]]es for example) were completely immune to a sunstone talisman. [[Ghost]]s were forced into a semi-material state. [[Vampire]]s took actual damage, but couldn't be slain by a sunstone talisman alone. Only the detached head and entrails of a [[penanggalan]] were susceptible to sunstone talisman's effects.\n\nSunstones could also store light- and energy-related discharge spells of all sorts. They were first carefully prepared by charging the stone using all but the last word of the desired incantation. Some time later the caster or someone else could touch the stone and speak the last word of the spell to release the stored energy, consuming the sunstone in the process. If the spell required a target, the activator had to be concentrating on the target at the time or else a random target was selected.\n\nSunstones were also used in the casting of the druid spell ''[[sunray]]'', and the [[elven]] spell ''[[sunbolt]]''."
