The '''''Gauntlet of Tyla'zhus''''' was a weapon that was heavily favored by [[illithid]]s who loved joining in melee combat, enjoyed torturing others, or just valued the defense this gauntlet supplied. This was another of the inventions of the [[Creative Creed]].{{Cite dragon/255/The New Illithid Arsenal|30}}

==Description==
The material of the basic gauntlet was animal hide of an unknown source. In the center of the palm rested a large [[ruby]] that was held in place by [[psionic]] circuitry. 

==Powers==
The first power supplied by the gauntlet was that it could shoot a thin ray of heat out of the ruby in the center of the palm. The range was 30 feet (9 meters) and would often burn the target.

Out of combat, the gauntlet also allowed an illithid to ''[[inflict pain]]'' without a ''[[mind link]]'' or personal contact. There was a chance that the glove would not be successful, but when it was the victim would divulge the requested information to their interrogator.

==Users==
It was often supplied to illithid sentinels in major tunnels that led into [[Oryndoll]].
