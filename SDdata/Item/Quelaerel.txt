Quelaerel () was a spicy brown sauce made by boiling threeb, a kind of leech found in jungles and swampy areas of many Abyssal layers, such as Gaping Maw, Slugbed, and Shedaklah.
This thick and fiery delicacy tasted like a lighted tamarind sauce and could greatly improve the taste of meats that had gone bad or fermenting fruits and vegetables. It was prized by Calishite gourmands and was used in other cuisines of Southern Faer√ªn.
