'''Quelaerel''' ({{Pronounce|kwel|AIR|ell|refs=}}) was a spicy brown sauce made by boiling [[threeb]], a kind of [[leech]] found in jungles and swampy areas of many [[Abyss|Abyssal]] layers, such as [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88: Gaping Maw|Gaping Maw]], [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 128: Slugbed|Slugbed]], and [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 222: Shedaklah|Shedaklah]].

==Description==
This thick and fiery delicacy tasted like a lighted [[tamarind]] sauce and could greatly improve the taste of meats that had gone bad or fermenting fruits and vegetables. It was prized by [[Calimshan|Calishite]] gourmands and was used in other cuisines of Southern [[Faer√ªn]].
