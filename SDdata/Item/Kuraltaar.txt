'''Kuraltaar''' was a [[category:magic items|magical]] [[diamond shield]] relying on the power of a bound [[glabrezu]] to provide great power to its bearer.

==Description==
Kuraltaar was forged from an alloy of [[silver]] with [[arjale]] and [[tantulhor]], two rare ores found in the [[Nine Hells]], in its case the fiery layer of [[Phlegethos]]. This gave it a silvery appearance with a greenish hue, and caused it to be extremely resistant to physical attacks while retaining a level of flexibility.

==Powers==
This magical shield had the ability to impart its bearer with great magical and elemental resistances akin to those of the [[fiend]] bound within, including immunity to [[poison]] and electricity.

Whenever the special protections provided by Kuraltaar were used, the image of a powerful and muscular glabrezu would cover the user.

==History==
Kuraltaar was one of thirteen [[demonshield]]s created by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] for the [[Shoon Imperium]] between the {{yearlinkName|128}} and the {{yearlinkName|132}}. The process of its creation included the binding of [[Kural'Risyk]], a powerful glabrezu.

While the other shields were distributed amongst high-ranking members of the empires, Kuraltaar was stored in the vaults of the imperium. During the {{yearlinkName|371}}, Kuraltaar was offered by the Qysara [[Shaani]] to the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]] in an attempt to bargain for peace.
