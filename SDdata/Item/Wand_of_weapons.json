        "mainbody": "A wand of weapons was a wand used by the Harpers.\nA wand of weapons empowered its user to summon weapons into specific locations. To utilize its power, the user was required to mentally select a target being within their line of sight, envision a desired weapon, and then uttered a command word. Upon activation, the envisioned weapon materialized instantly in front of the targeted creature and hovered in mid-air.\nThese summoned weapons were temporary magical constructs, vanishing into nothingness after the magical effect of the wand expired. They possessed exceptional craftsmanship and remained weightless and unbreakable. The summoned weapon appeared near the targeted creatures midsection, aligning with their current facing direction. Although another creature could grasp and utilize the weapon, the wand wielder held the ability to instantly dissolve it through an act of will.\nA wand of weapons allowed for the simultaneous delivery of multiple weapons to a targeted creature. In the event that the intended recipient failed to take hold of any of the summoned weapons, they found themselves encircled by an array of floating weaponry.\nA wand of weapons was capable of creating the following weapons\n* Dagger\n* Footmans pick\n* Warhammer\n* Footmans flail\n* Hand or throwing axe\n* Long sword\n* Footmans mace\n* Battle axe\n* Bastard sword\n* Morning star\n* Two-handed sword\n* Bill\n* Spear\n* Halberd"
