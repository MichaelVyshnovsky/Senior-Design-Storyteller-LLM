The '''Elfblades''' were three specific magical [[sword]]s created with [[Elven High Magic]] by spellcasters from the [[Elven Court]]—were wielded by the rulers of [[Cormanthyr]] and used to determine who was worthy of such responsibility in the ancient ritual of [[blade-rite]].

==History==
In −4000 DR, Coronal [[Oacenth]] of [[Jhyrennstar]] fell ill, and his fever proved incurable. As a prophet of [[Labelas Enoreth]], he spoke the famous words that would prove to one day unite the elves under the great Kingdom of Cormanthyr:

{{Quote|If we are to survive as is the Peoples' right, one Coronal must vow to unify the tribes of this great land. One Coronal must unify sun and moon, sky and sea, earth, tree, and root, and his promise to all is long-lasting peace and strength in unity.|Coronal Oacenth }}
At the Coronal's wish, young clansmen worked to prove their mettle, from which three candidates emerged, and these candidates were given the newly forged ''Elfblades'' to mark their rulership. As [[Kahvoerm Irithyl]] drew the ''Rulers' Blade'', he became ruler of [[Semberholme]], Jhyrennstar, and Elven Court, which later became Cormanthyr.

The three blades were each used to erect one of the towers in [[Castle Cormanthor]], creating the permanent domiciles of the rules in the Rule Tower, the War Tower, and the Art Tower.

==Common Characteristics==
While each Elfblade was unique, they shared common characteristics among the three of them.
* Each must be attained by the ritual of Blade-rite, a ritual overseen by Elven High Magic. All candidates to draw the Elfblades must be good-aligned.
* When the wielder of an ''Elfblade'' dies, the blade is rendered inert until drawn again as part of a Blade-rite.
* Any thief who drew the blade suffered as if failing a Blade-rite.
* Any ''[[N'Tel'Quess]]'' (non-[[elves]] or [[drow]], but not [[half-elves]]) who drew the blade was known to be struck dead.
* Each sword was a powerfully enchanted [[longsword]] that granted a ward against attacks as well as increasing the wielder's reaction time. They had magically ''[[keen]]'' blades imbued with holy energy.
* Each sword could shed light from a flicker to the strength of the [[Hours of the day|highsun]].
* Each sword added life to its wielder: the ''Ruler's Blade'' extended a wielder's life by up to six centuries, the ''Warblade'' returns an elf to the peak of physical age (usually a year after adulthood was gained), and the ''Artblade'' reduced the current age of its wielder by up to six centuries, though never beyond the first year of adulthood. Alternatively, each ''Elfblade'' slowed the wielder's aging process so that they aged at half the normal speed.
* Each sword was intelligent, was good-aligned, and could speak audibly and telepathically in [[Elven (language)|Elven]].
* Each sword responded negatively to unannounced changes in race, sex, or alignment on part of the wielder, sometimes forcing a new Blade-rite, causing the wielder jolts of pain, or simply dominating the wielder and forcing him or her to return the blade to the High Mages.
* Each sword bonded with the wielder during the Blade-rite, allowing the wielder to summon it to his or her hand at will, regardless of physical barrier, so long as each remained on the same plane of existence.
