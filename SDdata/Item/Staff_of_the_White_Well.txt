The '''Staff of the White Well''' was a magical [[staff]] for use by [[druid]]s. It was carved of white [[ash]] by the Great Druid [[Brianna Moonsinger]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, it was inherited by her daughter, [[Robyn Moonsinger]],

Robyn lost it [[1346 DR|the following year]] during the battle to defend the [[Moonwell]] when she was abducted by a flying creature.<ref>
