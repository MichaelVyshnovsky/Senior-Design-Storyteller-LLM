A '''''war wizard cloak''''' was a powerful [[magical]] item given to trusted agents of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
They were long, black weathercloaks that could cover the arms, chest and legs of the wearer, with high collars and attachable hoods. They bore a purple dragon insignia on the left collar and another on the back of the hood. The right collar bore the design of an upraised human palm in a white circle.

==Powers==
The cloak provided protection against extreme cold as a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' did, and conferred ''[[infravision]]'' on the wearer. It also provided ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'' and ''[[ironguard]]''. It could be used to cast ''[[sending]]'' and ''[[dimension door]]'' once each per day.
