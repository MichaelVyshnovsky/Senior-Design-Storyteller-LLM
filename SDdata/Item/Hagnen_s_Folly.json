        "mainbody": "'''''Hagnen's Folly''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[heavy crossbow]], strung with a [[dragon]]'s gut, created sometime before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Hagnen's Folly'' was a uniquely designed and enchanted crossbow that possessed the power and swiftness unseen among similar weapons. The weapon itself possessed a ''+3'' enchantment that increased its strength and guided its aim. Additionally, all missiles fired from the weapon gained additional ''+3'' damage to both, their deadliness and guided the [[bolt]]s towards the targets.",
        "History": "The crossbow that would later receive the name of its creator was never finished by [[Hagnen Odestone]], a dwarven designer of some renown. It was among many other weapons left unfinished when the dwarf was killed in the great earthquake of the {{YearlinkName|1275}}. His wife, [[Miraenna Odestoneâ€Ž]], begrudgingly finished her late husband's designs. One crossbow she finished by stringing it with a dragon's gut and making it ''Hagnen's Folly''. Miraenna took the ''Folly'' and other finished works when she left her clan and headed south to sell off her husband's work. Since then, ''Hagnen's Folly'' changed several owners until it ended up in the hands of [[Ilium Ar'Ghrenoir]], a [[druid]] defender inhabiting a secluded frozen settlement of [[Andora]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}."
