The''''' 'Ud of the Marids''''' was a beautiful magical ''[['ud]]'' created by [[marid]] luthiers to be presented to the new high chieftain of the [[jann of the High Desert]] on his ascension day.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

Each new [[jann]] chieftain received a full set of magical instruments known collectively as the [[instruments of the jann]]; therefore, multiple'' 'uds of the marids'' existed throughout [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
The entire body of this instrument was pure white and covered with intricate [[pearl]] carvings. The base, or soundbox, was actually made from a single giant pearl taken from one of the [[giant clam]]s of the [[Crowded Sea]]. Since collecting the giant pearl was a dangerous task, the marids wisely had lesser beings perform this task.

==Powers==
This'' 'ud'' allowed the user to cast a strong ''[[charm person]]'' spell when the instrument was played. [[Bard]]s and ''[[rawunin]]'' could use this power twice per day, but all others could only access this magic once per day.

Only bards and ''rawunin'' could "raise the waters" when playing the'' 'Ud of the Marids'', summoning a powerful [[water elemental]] to do their bidding. This power could only be used once per week and the '''ud'' needed to be near a sufficient supply of water in order for the magic to function. The elemental remained under control so long as the'' 'ud'' was played but instantly returned to their [[Elemental Plane of Water|home plane]] if the music was interrupted or ceased altogether.
