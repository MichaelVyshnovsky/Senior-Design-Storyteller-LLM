        "Description": "Deva's Bile was a rare [[fiend]]ish drink. It was hard to find outside Samora's breweries. The concoction was deadly to those from the [[Prime Material plane]] and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ survivable but [[poison]]ous. Those who survived consuming Deva's Bile went into a roaring drunk rage and, eventually, succumbed to violent illness."
