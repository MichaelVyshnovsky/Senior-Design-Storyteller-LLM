        "Description": "It was believed Ruby Racks could reinforce the eater's fortitude. The recipe called for a cup of dry [[oatmeal]], tow cups of [[wheat]] [[flour]], quarter pound of [[butter]], two [[egg]]s, half-a-cup of [[cocoa]], half-a-cup of [[sugar]], some [[vanilla]] and [[walnut]] extracts.\n\nThe dry ingredients were mixed together into a paste while gradually adding in [[milk]] and more sugar to taste. When the oven was preheated to 350 degrees, the resulting dough was rolled into small balls and squished on a greased baking sheet. They were baked for ten or fifteen minutes and then â€“ ready to be consumed.",
        "History": "The recipe for the Ruby Racks was recorded in the recipe book of Dradeel's during his accommodations within the [[Spellhold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He considered these cookies to be his pride and a recipe like no other, to be guarded with one's life. The recipe came from the kitchen of Dradeel's \"particularly shaggy\" friend."
