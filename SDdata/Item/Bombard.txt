Bombards, sometimes referred to as cannons, and maritime ships. The artillerists who manned bombards were sometimes referred to as bombardiers.
The typical bombard consisted of a short, thick barrel that was cast from wrought iron or bronze and set within a rigid wooden base. The standard bombard was divided into two types, light and heavy. On some worlds a cannon might have a wooden frame with wheels to support it, but the bombards of Toril lacked any such gun-carriages.Such a gun-carriage is depicted in the pages of Saturday Morning Adventures II 2. Until another Realms-specific source gives a description of a bombard or cannon with wheels, we assume that the artist was in error.
Bombards required a crew of at least three to man them. bombards were direct-fire weapons that fired their missiles in high arcs.
The missiles fired by bombards were typically large spheres of stones or cast iron. These were referred to as either "cannonballs" or "bombard shot". And on rare occasions necromancers created boneballs of skeletal undead to fire at enemy ships, which would turn into a shower of lacerating bone shards if not magically protected.
Much like other firearms, bombards required either gunpowder or smokepowder to fire. Regardless of whichever was used, bombards consumed large, coming down to roughly ten charges of smokepowder.
The firing of a bombards was followed by a thunderously loud noise. Their rate of fire was rather slow, as they needed to be cooled and cleaned of debris after every firing. And they were subject to misfiring.

* Bombards were considered to be quite rare and expensive on both the world of Toril Beyond Toril, their rarity was partially due to the variable nature of gunpowder and smokepowder across the Known Spheres, which made them unreliable compared to other forms of spelljammer armaments.
* The arcane, an influential race of spacefaring merchants, were known to sell bombards and smokepowder charges, the latter of which they typically sold for 3,000 gp. They often threw in two to five charges for free to anyone that bought a bombard from them.
* The Smiths Coster trading company, who sold various firearms across wildspace.
* Beyond the Prime Material plane, bombards could be found in some parts of the Domains of Dread, though they were considered to be fairly unreliable. Unlike the bombards of the Prime, these weapons were not cast, but rather fashioned from wood or metal strips and bound together wlth iron rings.More specifically, bombards were found in Domains of Dread where the cultural level was Chivalric.

Due to their size and crudeness, instances of magical bombards were incredibly rare, though slightly more common in wildspace.
* Great bombards, a variety of spelljammers unique to the giff, were so named for being armed with single massive bombard made of cold iron and banded with steel rings. This bombard replaced the spelljammers prow and ran half the length of the entire ship. Unlike normal bombards, they required twenty charges of smokepowder for a single shot.
* Inferno bombards, a pair of experimental bombards that were invented in the 15 century DR by the fire giant warlord Baron Ugarak and whose construction were overseen by the azer smith Hadutha. Rather than firing balls of stone or iron, these bombards were designed to fire huge globs of elemental fire. They were ultimately sabotaged by a group of adventurers before they could be tested in battle against the town of Secomber.
* Thayan bombards, a variety of bombards that were created by the Red Wizards of Thay sometime after having learned of the developments being made by the Lantanna.
The first recorded usage of bombards by the people of Lantan occurred early in the . These early bombards used gunpowder, as the substance had not yet been made inert on Toril and because the Lantanna had yet to discover and perfect the recipe for smokepowder.
The wizard Elminster felt this development was significant enough to warrant arranging a private meeting with Storm Silverhand to discuss them. Through the use of his magic he showed a visual display of the bombard testing and mused that they would likely be put to use in mainland Faer√ªn before the year was out. Storm reasoned that it was likely rulers throughout the Realms would send mages to either capture or kill the makers of this new weapon, then asked if she should slay them first, but Elminster admonished that he already asked Mystra and she forbade it. Instead, Elminster instructed Storm to travel with the Harper Aumarra Kethtan to Lantan and protect its people from any would-be "murderous capturing mages".
Meanwhile, Thayan spies had also observed the tests being conducted in Lantan and reported back to their Red Wizard masters. The Red Wizards determined that it was crucial for them to have command of such weapons themselves, beginning development on what would become the Thayan bombard.
After gunpowder was rendered inert in 1356 DR, all further developments in standard bombards would be done with smokepowder. due in part to the Red Wizards wanting to maintain secrecy with their weapon.
By the 15 century DR, the usage of bombards on Toril remained in a state of relative rarity. This was due to gun-carriages being uncommon, which made bombards dangerous to use on most ships, and shortages in smokepowder in the wake of the Spellplague.
