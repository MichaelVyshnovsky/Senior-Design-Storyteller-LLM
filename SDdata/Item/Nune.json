        "mainbody": "{{wikipedia article|Staurolite}}\n'''Nune''' was the common name for [[wikipedia:en:staurolite|staurolite]] (sometimes called \"cross stone\" or \"fairy stone\") in the Realms.",
        "Description": "These [[ornamental stones]] were translucent brown or nearly clear and occurred in small cross-shaped crystals up to one inch (two and a half centimeters) across either arm. These were commonly polished to a smooth sheen and pierced to be worn as pendants or linked as bracelets.  On [[Toril]], the cross was used as an ornament and not as a holy symbol. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "Nune stone powder was an essential ingredient of the [[ink]] used to scribe ''[[dispel magic]]'' scrolls and it was added to the immersion treatment when preparing to enchant a ''[[wand of negation]]''.",
