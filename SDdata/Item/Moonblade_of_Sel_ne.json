        "mainbody": "'''''Moonblades of Selûne''''' were [[enchanted]] [[longsword]]s gifted to the [[priest|priestesses]] of [[Selûne]] for going above and beyond in service of their [[Church of Selûne|church]].",
        "Description": "The blades of these magic swords were made of strange translucent pale-white material that gently glowed in the dark. To a casual observer, the edges were dull; however, when swung in combat, a ''Moonblade of Selûne'' proved to be a deadly weapon that cut its opponents with magic.",
        "Powers": "These powerful blades passed through armor and attacked the target's flesh directly through magic. This effect was similar to that of a ''+4'' enchantment. ''Moonblades'' drained the life out of the targets and left no visible wounds. Additionally, ''Moonblades of Selûne'' were devastatingly deadly to undead creatures as the weapons boiled away the creatures' essence.",
        "History": "By the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Moonblades of Selûne'' were rare gifts to the priestess of Selûne who committed themselves fully to the creed of the Moonmaiden and served beyond the duty to the faith. One notable welder of the such blade was [[Emma Moonblade]], who settled in the wilderness outside the [[Shaengarne Ford]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the priestess' enemy, the [[troll]] [[Vrek Vileclaw]], ambushed her during a battle against [[orc]]s of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] and stole the ''Moonblade''. Emma implored a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]] to recover the blade."
