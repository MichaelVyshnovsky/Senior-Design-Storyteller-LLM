        "mainbody": "The tendril rings of Ilsensine were exceedingly rare psionic bracers. They could only be made in mind flayer colonies that either had the avatar of the deity Ilsensine manifest, or in hives that its proxy Lugribossk had visited.\nThe tendril rings were thin slips of silver that were large enough to be slipped over a ulitharids mouth tentacles. They always came in pairs as many of their powers would not work with one alone.\nThe tendril rings made it harder to harm their user with means other than physical combat.\nWhen a wearer was heavily injured, the rings had a built-in defense mechanism that automatically teleported the wearer to a predetermined location on the same plane whether they wished it or not. In doing so, the rings would consume half of the remaining psionic energy possessed by the ulitharid. This behaved similarly to the spell teleport without error. The only way to stop this from happening was to remove at least one of the rings.\nThe tendril rings were instilled with Ilsensines power, and once a week a ulitharid was able to utilize another power by rubbing them together. This action caused an eerie sound that resonated both mentally and physically. Soon after, the tendril rings would connect to Ilsensine and an infinitesimally small portion of the deitys power would leak through into the surrounding area. Illithids and victims within 240 yards (219 meters) became subject to the alien thoughts of Ilsensine itself. Non-illithids could be stunned for up to two minutes, while psionicists were more resistant to the effects. Victims that managed to not get stunned found it difficult to do anything for a short time. Mages and priests lost up to four random memorized spells and would have to memorize or pray for them again. Victims were unable to concentrate for half a day, during which psionicists could not replenish their psionic energy and spellcasters could not regain their spells. In contrast to this horror, illithids found Ilsensines thoughts extremely soothing.\n* Tharcereli, the Creedmaster of the Loretaker Creed in Oryndoll.\n* Cephalossk, the Creedmaster of the Venerator Creed in Oryndoll.\nThese tendril rings were also owned by the ulitharid Creedmasters of the Elder Concord of Oryndoll."
