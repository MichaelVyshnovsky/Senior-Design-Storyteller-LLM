'''Scale armor''' was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Plate mail consisted of a leather coat, leggings and sometimes skirt which was covered in small plates of overlapping scales. The finished armor would often resemble the scales of a fish. Although [[steel]] was commonly used to make scale mail, actual animal scales (like [[dragon]] scales) could be used. Although heavy, the flexibility and adjust-ability of scale mail armor made it surprisingly easy to wear.

==Variations==
;Coin Armor: A rare form of scale armor made with over a thousand coins. They were typically seen in use by high-ranking generals and dignitaries.

;[[Sea elven scale mail]]: An expensive form of scale armor that was unique to the [[sea elves]].

==Notable Wearers of Scale armor==
===Religions===
* [[Painteacher]]s, a variety of specialty priest of the [[Church of Loviatar]], generally wore scale mail in emulation of their goddess.<ref>
* Scalemail was the only type of armor that worshipers of [[Sseth]] were known to wear. These were fashioned to resemble the scales of snakes and tinted in a pattern common to one of Faerun's many serpent species.
