Scale armor was a type of armor used on Toril.
Plate mail consisted of a leather coat, leggings and sometimes skirt which was covered in small plates of overlapping scales. The finished armor would often resemble the scales of a fish. Although steel was commonly used to make scale mail, actual animal scales (like dragon scales) could be used. Although heavy, the flexibility and adjust-ability of scale mail armor made it surprisingly easy to wear.
