The ankh of life was a powerful artifact that was a holy symbol of the manifestation of Re.
The ankh was worn and covered with dirt. It was made from birch and measured  in length.
This artifact could use the following powersâ€”resurrection twice per day, restoration three times per day, regenerate three times per day, destroy undead, 30 radius three times per day, and continual light at will. However, these great powers came with a steep cost. Using any of these powers, aside from continual light, permanently drained a portion of the wielders experiences and memories. This was only restorable via a wish.
The ankh of life was lost during the Orcgate Wars. Clergy of both Horus-Re and Osiris searched desparately for the artifact so they could place it with a manifestation of Re within the Tower of Eternity in skuld.
