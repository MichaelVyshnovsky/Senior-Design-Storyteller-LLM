'''Upsidedown cakes''' were a type of sweet [[bread]], topped with fruit, found in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[the Vast]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an upsidedown cake cake recipe was known to [[Harold]] of the [[Crescent Moon Inn]] in Ravens Bluff. This cake was baked by Harold during a tournament hosted at the year end celebration of the {{YearlinkName|1371}} in [[Mossbridges]]. However, it was not recorded whether Harold's [[pineapple]] upsidedown cake won.
