It was able to point out the safest and quickest way of escape, either from a trap or a maze (including the powerful spell of the same name). If the Trickster was at threat from range, he could turn the dagger into a +4 sling of seeking. In this form, it was able to sling bullets to deal damage, or even dust balls. These balls of dust did not hurt the target, as fired bullets would, but instead could put them into a very deep sleep."
