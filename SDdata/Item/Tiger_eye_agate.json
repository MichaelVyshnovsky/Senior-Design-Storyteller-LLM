        "Description": "This [[agate]] was a golden hue with dark brown stripes that exhibited a silky luster called [[wikipedia:en:chatoyancy|chatoyancy]]. This [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was named for its color and its stripes. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "Legends about this mineral said that it repelled undead and restless spirits, but had never been proven to be true. Regardless of this lack of evidence, the legend generated demand for tiger eye to be powdered and used in inks to mark caskets, sarcophagi, and tombs to prevent the dead from rising, and as an ingredient in ''[[potion of undead control|potions of undead control]]''."
