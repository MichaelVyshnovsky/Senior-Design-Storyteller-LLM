        "Description": "A book consisted of a collection of pages that were glued or bound together. The pages usually were not made of [[paper]] made from wood, but from some kind of [[parchment]] made of [[sheep]], [[goat]], or [[calfskin]]. The reason for this was that [[Toril]] did not have the necessary technology to mass-produce paper, it was―if at all―only produced alchemically. Pages in [[spellbook]]s and other valuable books were made of [[vellum]]. However, paper made of [[linen]], bone, [[ivory]], or metal foil were also known to be used for the pages of a spellbook, owing to the greater durability of these materials.\n\nBinding a book was done by hand. While it was not common, the pages could receive additional protection through a wooden cover that was in turn covered by leather while the pages were stitched to a leather sheet. Other cover materials used for spellbooks were thin wood, soft or hard metal, or [[dragonhide]].\n\nBooks containing poetry, historic texts, and lore, as well as [[gnome|gnomish]] technical diagrams, were commonly carried by adventurers.",

There existed only about a dozen copies of each book.\n\nBooks were, despite being a luxury item, only lightly guarded when transported by traders. The reason for this was that books were not very attractive for tribal creatures and monsters, who often attacked such caravans. That said, a danger was posed by rival merchants who hired mercenaries to sabotage the trading endeavors of their rivals.",
