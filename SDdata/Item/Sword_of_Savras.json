        "mainbody": "The '''''Sword of Savras''''' was a magical [[flying sword|flying longsword]] that roamed [[Faerûn]] since the mid-15{{th}} century [[DR]], attacking [[spellcaster]]s seemingly at random.{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|24-27}}",
        "Description": "The ''Sword of Savras'' looked like a regular [[longsword]] made of plain metal, with a worn leather grip. When striking its targets, the sword would flare with bright blue light.{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|25}}",
        "Behavior": "The Sword of Spells only attacked victims capable of wielding [[arcane magic]], and ignored any other creature. While no pattern could be discerned as how it choose its victims, it attacked very few [[warlock]]s and never targeted any [[Chosen of Mystra]].<ref name=\"drag417-p25/>",
        "Powers": "When a spellcaster was hit by the Sword of Spells, they suffered as much as much damage as if they were hit by a regular longsword, but would fall unconscious immediately. Should they survive their wounds, they would find themselves slightly weakened but with knowledge of a brand new, rare and unfamiliar [[spell]].{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|26}}\n\nWhen wounding warlocks, the sword would severe the pact binding them to their patron, causing them to lose their ability to wield arcane magic.{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|25,27}}\n\nHere are some examples of spells bestowed by the sword to its victims:{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|26}}\n\n* The ability to control the conflagration from [[fire]] spells such as ''[[fireball]]'' or ''[[wall of fire]]'', causing it to instantly jump to a different location within {{SI|120|feet|long=yes}}.\n* The ability to create a floating [[illusion|illusory]] face similar from which the caster could see, speak, and cast spells.\n* A teleportation spell similar to ''[[dimension door]]'', that could teleport the caster or simple objects over short distances thrice over 10 minutes.\n* A spell damper that could cause part of the damage from incoming magic to be turned into harmless sounds and lights.\n\nIn addition the sword was particularly fast and nimble, allowing it to avoid mundane attempts of capture. It was also enchanted with a powerful [[spell reflection]] effect protecting it from magical attacks.",
        "History": "The ''Sword of Savras'' was created by [[Savras|the eponymous deity]] before its fight with [[Azuth]]. The sword originally healed any damage it caused upon withdrawal, and was intended by the deity as a mean to reward [[Church of Savras|its worshipers]] with new and interesting magic. Used during the battle which opposed its creator against the ascending Lord of Spells, it suffered a volley of magic which damaged it and stripped it of its healing powers.{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|25-26}}\n\nEncaged in a magic ''[[forcecage]]'' by Azuth, the sword reappeared during the {{yearlinkName|1449}}, probably due to a weakening of its prison. It started attacking people with regularity until the {{yearlinkName|1454}}, when it vanished for several months. After its reappearance later this year, [[Elminster]] managed to capture the sword and study it for a while.",
        "Reputation": "As the cause of the sword's existence was unknown before Elminster got a chance to study it, rumors abounded regarding its purpose. Some believed the artifact was created by [[Asmodeus]], while others imagined it was the work of [[Szass Tam]] trying to weaken his competition.{{Cite dragon/417/Eye on the Realms: The Sword of Spells|25}}",
