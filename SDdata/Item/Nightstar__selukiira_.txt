The '''Nightstar''' was the ''[[selu'kiira]]'' of [[Saelethil Dlardrageth]] in which the old secrets of [[Aryvandaar]] were recorded.

==Description==
The Nightstar was a [[dagger|dagger-shaped]] deep purple crystal about 3 in (0.08 m) in length with pale glyphs. It contained more than seventy spells.

==History==
After the destruction of [[House Dlardrageth]] by the [[Coronal]] of [[Arcorar]], [[Ithraides]] discovered the ''selu'kiira'' and concealed it, but created three ''[[telkiira]]'' that would lead to its location. [[Araevin Teshurr]] recovered the Nightstar from the vault of Ithraides beneath a white tower in the [[Elven Court]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]].
