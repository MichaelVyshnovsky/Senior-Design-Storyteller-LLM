        "Powers": "''Reliance'' possessed a ''+4'' enchantment.",
        "History": "Long before [[1281 DR]], ''Reliance'' and an enchanted [[short sword]] ''[[Bloodfarmer]]'', never left the side of their famous master, warrior Ket \"the Keen\" Stillpond. The halfling was obsessed with keeping the dagger on his person at all times, something that reportedly resulted in him being kicked out of [[Cormyr]]ean royal court. Unbound weapons were not allowed by the tradition and the laws of the Forest Kingdom. After Ket's death, his family donated ''Reliance'' to the [[Church of Arvoreen]]. Subsequently, the church passed the enchanted dagger to a promising young halfling warrior. However, ''Reliance'' did not say with the warrior for long as a pack of bandits murdered him after the halfling foolishly and naively left the dagger with guards of a seemingly friendly camp.\n\nBy 1281 DR, ''Reliance'' ended up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]]."
