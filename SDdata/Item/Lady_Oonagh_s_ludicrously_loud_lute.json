        "mainbody": "Lady Oonaghs ludicrously loud lute was an enchanted elven lute that belonged to Lady Oonagh of the Forest of Tethir.\nThe ludicrously loud lute produced intense sounds that rendered creatures that could hear it unable to function, suffering from pain and bleeding ears. Twice per day, the lute allowed the player to produce a crippling sound similar to the effects of the sound burst spell.\nLady Oonagh was born into a musically inclined elven family from the Forest of Tethir, but lacked any talent herself and in fact sang terribly. Thus, her traveling companion and lover, Lord Alex, presented her with Lady Oonaghs ludicrously loud lute as a gag birthday gift. This enchanted musical instrument matched the Ladys wretched singing voice with its own cacophonous tune. Both sounded bad enough to make listeners ears bleed.\nBy 1372 DR, the ludicrously loud lute could be found in one of the piles of \"antiques\" within the Torleths Treasures store of Gillians Hill. The lute appeared mundane, and its magic remained unidentified, mixed with other junk, sold for a mere one hundred gold pieces."
