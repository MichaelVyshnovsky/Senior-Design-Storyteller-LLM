        "mainbody": "'''Ivory''', also known as [[wikipedia:en:dentine|dentine]], was the primary substance that makes up the teeth or tusks of all mammals and some other creatures. It was carved for artistic ornaments and also many practical uses.",
        "Description": "Pure ivory was a bright white color, but acquired stains, discolorations, and patterns during use by the animal from which it came. Some animals that grew large teeth or tusks were [[behemoth (creature)|behemoth]], [[boar]], [[elephant]], [[hippopotamus]], [[mammoth]], [[narwhal]], [[umber hulk]], [[walrus]], and the [[sperm whale|cachalot whale]]. Larger specimens were used for carving while smaller pieces were used for buttons or ornamentation on clothing, accouterments, and even buildings. The price of raw ivory depended on the hardness, the color or mottling of colors, how well it polished, and current preferences. A typical price range was 1 to 5&nbsp;gp per pound (0.45kg). Carved and polished ivory items had a base value of 10&nbsp;gp.\n\nFossilized ivory was found in small quantities, being the result of prehistoric elephant, [[mastodon]], and [[smilodon]] teeth being buried for millennia, causing parts of its structure to be replaced by minerals. Because it was not soft enough to carve, there was not much of a market for fossilized ivory.",
        "Powers": "Ivory from common animals had no known magical properties. Teeth and fangs from magical creatures such as [[displacer beast]]s and [[dragon]]s did have use in practicing [[the Art]]."
