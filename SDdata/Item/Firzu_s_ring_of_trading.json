        "mainbody": "'''''Firzu's ring of trading''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that once belonged to the lady merchant named [[Firzu]], who did business in the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Firzu's ring'' possessed a simple enchantment that improved the wearer ability to lie, bluff, and mislead – invaluable for merchants.",
        "History": "Firzu was a notorious merchant who regularly tried to sail past Reithwin's toll house without paying the toll for the trade goods he transported. Firzu's life ended sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, when the town was plunged into the darkness and turned into the [[shadow-cursed lands]]. His charred body, still wearing his enchanted ring, was stored in the [[House of Healing (Reithwin)|House of Healing]]'s morgue – likely murdered by the wicked [[Sharran]] [[Thorm]] family for avoiding the tolls."
