        "mainbody": "Kaeth (or kaethae\nKaeth was primarily produced in Maztica, the Anauroch desert, areas to the south and east of Durpar, Around 1367 DR, it was claimed that coffee grew only in the Shining Lands of Durpar, Estagund, and Var the Golden, and coffee was the Shining Lands most profitable export.The Shining South (1993) contradicts itself several times on whether coffee comes from Durpar or Ulgarth. Since the sourcebook is introduced by a Halruaan, and all Ulgarths produce comes through Durpar, the discrepancy is easily explained as an in-universe error, but not easily resolved. The flat, sunny plains of the Shining Lands were also suitable for growing coffee and other crops. \nKaeth beans were harvested from short trees in mountainous areas, then sun-dried on rocks. Finally, the beans would be stuffed into cloth sacks, then the sacks would be stacked inside wooden crates for ease of transport.\nFinally, when it was to be drunk, it was brewed into a black-hued beverage.\nCoffee had a reputation for refreshing the imbibers mind.\nKaeth beans originating in Maztica were typically red-brown and had a powdery quality. These were shipped across the sea, to Baldurs Gate, and typically distributed from there to Tashalar and Calimshan. Kaeth brewed in Westgate was typically of a strong variety and was made from ground red beans. Westgate kaeth was popular outside of the Dragon Coast and could be found bottled and sold on the Sword Coast, as far north as the city of Luskan.\nAnauran beans were smaller, harder, and so dark brown that they looked almost black. The nomadic Bedine people who cultivated the beans referred to kaeth as qahwa or simply qaw. After the return of Thultanthar, the Bedine consumed most of the supply themselves. As a result, the Anauran beans were extremely uncommon outside of their native region.\nThe kaeth beans from beyond Durpar were larger, had a pronounced cleft or depressed line running their length, and were brown with a bluish hue. This variant was often referred to as Thondurs, named after the trader Thondur, who for a while had a monopoly on the kaeth trade reaching Calimshan, Tashalar, and the Vilhon Reach. This bean type was the most common in lands to the south. In the 15 century DR, Thondurs became cheaper thanks to the shattering of Thondurs monopoly.\nOn the plane of Bytopia, popular kaeth variants included \"Krigala Supreme\" from the Beastlands, \"Mountain Majesty\" from Mount Celestia, as well as \"Devotion\" and \"Purity\" from Elysium.\nAmn was known to brew strong and bitter spiced kaeth that was described as being as dark as tar.\nIn the Domains of Dread, the Vistani were known to brew coffee that was described as being particularly bitter and thick.\nPreviously enjoyed only in southeast Faerûn, Durpari traders began large-scale export of Durpar-grown coffee around 1367 DR. Drinking coffee was just becoming popular in wider Faerûn at the time. It was drunk in Cormyr by Eleint of 1367 DR, even at the Bold Bard tavern in Ghars, but it was too costly for common folk. Coffee was regularly exported from the Shining Lands by 1373 DR.\nIn the 15 century DR, the kaeth trade was considered more popular and profitable than the tea trade.\nthumb|A stein filled with a common Amnian black spiced kaeth.\nBrewed kaeth was the most popular form in Calimshan, the Tashalar, the Heartlands, and the North. In some places, kaeth was mixed with medicines or mint leaves sprinkled over the surface, prepared by stewing the beans in a pot over a fire or a hearth.According to Ed Greenwood Presents Elminsters Forgotten Realms, page 94, black coffee in the Realms is stronger than its real-world counterpart because of the preparation method. Some people also liked to chew beans while traveling or eat them roasted.\nIn Calimshan and Tashalar, kaeth was mostly consumed pure, although sometimes with the addition of powdered roots, nuts, or ginger. In Sembia and Chessenta, the preferred method of consumption involved mixing kaeth with chocolate or alcohol.\nIn areas to the north, kaeth was mostly served in cider mugs. In southern lands, it was more commonly served in small, flared bowls known as \"kavvar\".\nBad coffee was described using a handy repertory of oaths in northern lands, while in the South it was called ortulag (), a word derived from a defunct dialect meaning \"warmed-over chamber pot rinse.\"\nIn some settlements, there were specialist shops known as kaeth houses, such as the House of the Lute in Baldurs Gate and over thirty known establishments in Waterdeep circa 1479 DR.\nManiacal Mannys Sensational Emporium of Sales in Procampur carried some specialty coffee blends from all around Faerûn, including Thayvian Cappuccino Mist, Sembian Dark Roast, and Waterdhavian Purple Late.\nCoffee beans were a material component used to cast the chaotic sleep spell."
