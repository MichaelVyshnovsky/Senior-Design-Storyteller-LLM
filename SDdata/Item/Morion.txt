'''Morions''' were an open-faced style of [[helmet]]<ref> worn in parts of the [[Lands of Intrigue]] region of [[west Faerûn]].

==Description==
These helmets were denoted as having oval-shaped sides, which helped to deflect projectiles, as well as an elevated brim in the front and back. This high brim gave greater visibility compared to some helmets, but left the neck and lower half of the wearer's head vulnerable to attacks, necessitating further protection such as [[gorget]]s. The sides and brim of the helmet were overshadowed by a comb atop the helmet, which stood up to {{SI|4|in|long=yes}} high. This high crest served the purpose of preventing attacks from penetrating the wearer's skull and spreading the resulting force of downward blows.{{Cite dragon/25/Arms and Armor of the Conquistadors|45}}

==Notable Morions==
* ''[[Steelwatcher helmet]]'', a variety of [[enchanted]] morions that were forged from [[infernal iron]] and used to outfit [[steel watcher]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Notable Users==
===Organizations===
* Some bandits in west Faerûn wore morions, such as a group of [[halfling]]s that tried to rob Countess [[Zaranda Star]]'s caravan in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] in [[1366 DR]].
* Some members of the [[Golden Legion]] possibly wore morions.<ref><ref group="note" name="debate">See the "Background" sub-section of the Appendix for a detailed argument regarding this topic.

===Regions & Settlements===
* Morions were part of the uniform of the civic guardsmen of [[Zazesspur]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]]. This style of helmet continued to be part of their uniform well into the late 15{{th}} century DR.<ref>{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Zazesspur in the 1490s DR}}
