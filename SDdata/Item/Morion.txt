Morions were an open-faced style of helmet worn in parts of the Lands of Intrigue region of west Faerûn.
These helmets were denoted as having oval-shaped sides, which helped to deflect projectiles, as well as an elevated brim in the front and back. This high brim gave greater visibility compared to some helmets, but left the neck and lower half of the wearers head vulnerable to attacks, necessitating further protection such as gorgets. The sides and brim of the helmet were overshadowed by a comb atop the helmet, which stood up to  high. This high crest served the purpose of preventing attacks from penetrating the wearers skull and spreading the resulting force of downward blows.
