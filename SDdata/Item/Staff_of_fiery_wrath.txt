The '''''staff of fiery wrath''''' was a potent [[magic]] [[staff]] that was created during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This [[flaming]] staff allowed the wielder to hurl ranged blasts of [[fire]] at their enemies. These blasts would occasionally and unpredictably explode violently and engulf all of the target's allies as well.

==History==
The ''staff of fiery wrath'' was originally forged by the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]]. It subsequently came into the possession of the [[rashemi]] [[wizard]] [[Shevarith Kendia]], who made extensive [[arcane]] modifications to the staff in hopes of turning it into a weapon that would earn her the attention and favor of [[Blackstaff]] [[Vajra Safahr]]. She succeeded.

==Notable Owners==
* Shevarith Kendia, a [[human]] wizard and [[adventurer]] who worked on behalf of the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]]. [[Laeral Silverhand]], in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
