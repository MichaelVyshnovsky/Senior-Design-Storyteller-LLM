        "mainbody": "A reaver was a farm implement that could be used as a melee weapon.\nA reaver was designed to reduce the time and labor of harvesting in the fields. It consisted of two curved blades hinged at their tips. When swung, the blades extended until they hit something, at which point they folded at the hinge to scissor together. This scissoring action was known to make a distinctive whirling and scraping sound when used in the fields.\nWhen used in combat, a wielder ran the risk of injuring themselves. This risk was offset, however, by the reavers remarkably dangerous ability to easily decapitate a foe with a single strike.\nSome farmers swore that the use of reavers halved the time it took for them to complete their harvests."
