        "mainbody": "A '''''justice blade''''' was a magic [[longsword]] made by the [[church of Tyr]]. Many of them had been forged.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Magic of Faer√ªn]]'' says these are manufactured by the church of [[Torm]], but also says they bear the symbol of Tyr, god of justice. This is also borne out by the sword's name. Therefore, it assumed \"Torm\" is in error, and these are created by the church of Tyr.",
        "Description": "It appeared to be made from [[bronze]] that had been magically hardened. It was inscribed with the holy symbol of [[Tyr]], a hammer and scales.",
        "Powers": "It was a ''+1 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[mighty cleaving]] longsword''. The blade gave off a white light to about 20 ft (6 m) when drawn."
