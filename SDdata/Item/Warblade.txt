The '''''Warblade''''', also known as the '''Noble Warrior's Blade''', or '''Ary'Velahr'Kerym''' in [[Elven (language)|Elven]], was one of three ''[[elfblade]]s'' created in ancient [[Cormanthyr]] to help the elves establish a ruling family.

==History==
The ''Warblade'' was created by [[Elven High Magic]] alongside its mates, the ''[[Artblade]]'' and the ''[[Rulers' Blade]]'' in {{Yearlink|-4000}}, at the behest of the ill [[Coronal]] of [[Jhyrennstar]], [[Oacenth]], who desired the magical swords to determine the rulers of the united tribes and the new nation of Cormanthyr.

Later, in the {{YearlinkName|-331}}, Lord [[Orym Hawksong]] fell in battle at the siege of the [[Twisted Tower]], but not before the ''Warblade'' suddenly sprang up and defended him for a time, before being paralyzed by [[drow]] magics. The body of the hero and the blade were stolen into the darkness, thereafter sought by more than a hundred elves fruitlessly. After its loss, the Arms-Majors instead wielded ''[[Moonblades]]'' or one of the six [[Baneblades of Demron|''Baneblades'']] created by the human wizard [[Demron]].

In the {{YearlinkName|500}}, the elven noble and [[bladesinger]] [[Josidiah Starym]] embarked on a famous quest to retrieve the ''Warblade'' from the Twisted Tower with a band of his adventuring friends. He returned in the {{YearlinkName|674}} not with the ''Warblade'', but with the ''Artblade'' instead.

For a time, the ''Warblade'' was rumored to be in a secret vault beneath a temple of [[Lolth]] in the ruins of [[Maerimydra]], in the [[Underdark]]. However, near the end of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the elf [[Ilsevele Miritar]] was alerted by ancient wards that the ''Warblade'' had surfaced to the Realms Above, somewhere near the Twisted Tower.

==Powers==
The ''Warblade'', like others of its type, shared some common characteristics with its kin, the other ''elfblades'', but also had its own special powers.

One of those powers slowed the aging process of its wielder by a half. So for every two years that passed, its wielder would only age one.

This sword constantly shone like silver and remained perfectly reflective despite use. The sword and its hilt (as well as the wielder's hand) were constantly bathed in blue and silver harmless flames. Visible at the seat of the blade was an elven rune meaning "[[weapon]]". The wielder could gain a [[bull's strength]] three times per day and [[detect evil]] and [[detect good]] at will. After completing a blade-dance ritual, the wielder was able to summon a dynamic [[blade barrier]]. However, if they failed the Blade-rite, the wielder's hand would clench the sword with extreme strength, causing them much pain and leaving deep palm scars. If the wielder was a [[N'Tel'Quess]] (non-elf or drow) or of [[evil]] nature, the sword became a ''dancing sword'' and attacked the wielder for upwards of an hour, attempting to slay them.
