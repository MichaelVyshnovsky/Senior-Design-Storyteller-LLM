        "mainbody": "'''''Sheets of smallness''''' were [[enchanted]] items that could drastically reduce objects in size and return them to their original state. These [[magic item]]s could be found as far south as the markets of [[Zakhara]].",
        "Description": "''Sheets of smallness'' appeared as mundane pieces of cloth or similar material. The most often encountered ''sheets'' were made out of [[linen]], [[silk]], or even [[paper]], on occasion.<ref>{{Cite book| author =Â Gary Gygax| title = Return to the Keep on the Borderland| short_story = | date = 1999| editor = Duane Maxwell| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 0-7869-1327-4| pages = 46| chapter = }} These items could resemble simple covering sheets, or a crumpled sheet of paper. However, all ''sheets of smallness'' had two distinctly patterned or colored sides. One was flat and undecorated while the other had a pattern or a solid black color. These ''sheets'' emanated ''[[alteration]]'' magics.",
        "Powers": "''Sheets of smallness'' had several uses. Any item, whether mundane, magical, or even a powerful [[artifact]], when wrapped in the correct side of one of these sheets reduced in size to one-twelfth of the original size and weight. To return the reduced item to its original size, it needed to be unwrapped and touched to the ''sheet's'' other side. Items that were reduced in size became virtually unusable, and the size change process took around two minutes. ''Sheets of smallness'' could only affect non-living things.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Goldeyes]], specialty [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Waukeen]], were gifted several enchanted items upon reaching the status and becoming touched by the goddess. ''Sheets of smallness'' were among them.\n* [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets. He owned a ''sheet of smallness'' and sometimes kept it on his person."
