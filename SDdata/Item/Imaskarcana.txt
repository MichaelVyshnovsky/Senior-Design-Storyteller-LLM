The '''''Imaskarcana''''' were a collection of [[artifact]]s said to be the most powerful ever created by the artificers of [[Imaskar]]. Though some considered the Imaskarcana to be tomes, they were in fact a number of different devices of different forms, each storing the lore of the empire in some form.

Per some sources, despite being called the '''Seven Imaskarcana''',.

==Description==
The ''[[First Imaskarcana]]'' was a large, crudely wrought crown of lavender-tinted metal set with a single [[star sapphire]].

The ''[[Third Imaskarcana]]'' was a great tome bound in slate covers, lined in the [[dragonhide|hide]] of a [[blue dragon]], with pages of ragged vellum, crystal magically given the flexibility of paper without its weaknesses, and even the skins of [[human]]s, [[Elf|elves]], and [[tanar'ri]].

The ''[[Fifth Imaskarcana]]'' was a scepter, pitted and battered in appearance, about {{SI|2|feet|long=yes}} in length set with a fist-sized [[amethyst]].

The ''[[Seventh Imaskarcana]]'' resembled a large, golden key.{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|8}}

==Powers==
The ''First Imaskarcana'' held the collected knowledge of the empire's lord artificers, though it would never engage in conversation, responding only to direct questions with brief answers.

The ''Third Imaskarcana'' could not be read, and instead would answer questions posed to it once per day.

The ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' contained the entire military history of the Imaskar from {{Yearlink|-7500}} onward.

The ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' held the entire body of Imaskari knowledge about creating permanent extradimensional spaces.

In addition to these powers, all of the Imaskarcana provided some measure of resistance against [[magic]] and allowed the user to employ several spells. All commands to the Imaskarcana had to be spoken in [[Roushoum]], the language of the Imaskari Empire. If addressed in a different language, the Imaskarcana would retaliate with powerful magic.

==History==
Per some sources, the ''First Imaskarcana'' was reported to have been created by an ancient Lord Artificer about 9000 years before [[1372 DR]]. The ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' was created some five centuries later. However, later sources dated the creation of all of the ''Imaskarcana'' to {{YearlinkName|-3891}}.

Lord [[Dimarond]], the last general of Imaskar, wielded the ''Fifth Imaskarcana'' when he was defeated outside the city by [[Mulan]] [[glorious servitor]]s. Lord Artificer [[Yuvaraj]] wore the ''First Imaskarcana'' in battle against the manifested god [[Horus-Re|Horus]] in {{Yearlink|-2488}} at [[Inupras]], where he perished. He was also said to have been wielding a fabled tome of the ''Imaskarcana'', probably the ''[[Third Imaskarcana|Third]]''. One year later, Imaskari refugees headed for the Underdark, bringing the ''Third Imaskarcana'' with them.<ref>

As of [[1372 DR]], one of the ''Imaskarcana'' was preserved in Deep Imaskar. It was probably not the ''Third Imaskarcana'', which was in the possession of [[Gduar]]. In the same year, the ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' was possibly recovered by [[Tyaral]], a priest of [[Bhaal]], from a ruin known as [[Maskana]], which had been leveled by the [[Mulhorandi]] to build an outpost atop it. The artifact was said to lie hidden within the ruins of Raudor still in [[1479 DR]].<ref>

==Legends==
The Imaskarcana were often portrayed as tomes, even amongst the [[Deep Imaskari]], though they were several different devices.

According to ''The Lore of Omanond'', a book in the [[Deep Imaskar#Architecture|Purple Library]] of [[Deep Imaskar]], it had only been possible to create the Imaskarcana because of a compact with an extraplanar race.
