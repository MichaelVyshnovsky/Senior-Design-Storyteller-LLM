        "Description": "The blade of the ''giantslayer'' was battered down and rough. It featured several serrations and a hooked tip. Its golden crossguard resembled the open maw of a [[dragon]] and had, over time, become encrusted with some manner of red, bubbly growth.",
        "Powers": "''Balduran's Giantslayer'' possessed a ''+3 [[item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and granted the wielder several boons. It was exceptionally potent against imposing creatures, from those as large as an [[ogre]] to those as grand as dragons, and could even knock them down with a successful strike.\n\nWhenever the ''giantslayer'' did successfully strike down a foe, the wielder felt a surge of supernatural strength. That strength allowed them to assail large creatures with even greater efficacy.\n\nOne or more times per day the wielder of ''Balduran's Giantslayer'' could grow in size themselves, for about a minute's duration.",
        "History": "[[File:Balduran's Giantslayer.png|thumb|''Balduran's Giantslayer glowing with magic.'']]\nBalduran wielded his ''giantslayer'' when he cut down and killed his friend and one-time traveling companion the [[bronze dragon]] [[Ansur]].\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Balduran's Greatsword'' remained lodged in the remains of Ansur's corpse, which lay in the depths of the [[Wyrmway]] beneath the [[Wyrm's Rock]] fortress."
