Amnian dessert wine was a type of sweet red wine exported out of Amn and found in the Western Heartlands, along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Traditionally, Amnian dessert wine was imbibed in celebration of deals by the inhabitants of the nation of Amn. It was said that this sweet wine washed away bitterness from the haggling.
