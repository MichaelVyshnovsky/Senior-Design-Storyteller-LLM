Girdles of masculinity/femininity were very rare, cursed magical belts that changed the wearers sex.
Girdles of masculinity/femininity were exceedingly rare items that were often discussed and sought after for the powerful magics used to weave these belts into being. The effects of the items curse were relatively minor, compared to other dangerous and deadly curses in existence. Once a girdle of masculinity/femininity was put on, the items magic changed the wearers sex and could only be removed by the remove curse spell or by a powerful cleric at a temple.
Circa 1318 DR, one of the girdles of masculinity/femininity was gifted by an unnamed court jester to Duke Lobelahns lover. This gesture was poorly received, resulting in the jesters execution.
In 1360 DR, one of the earliest examples of a girdle of masculinity/feminity was found amongst the relics unearthed from Solon by the slaves of Ambuchar Devayam during their excavations. This one was referred to as a girdle of gender alteration, and unlike future girdles, concealed its effect from its wearer, to whom the effects were not apparent. It also did not operate on putting it on it only took effect when removed.
Sometime circa 1367 DR, a halfling fighter wizard Brac Bristletoes from Beluir had his girdle of storm giant strength stolen. The halfling eventually recovered what he thought to be his belt. Unfortunately, what he found was a girdle of masculinity/femininity. Brac spent several years adventuring in a womans body until he was able to acquire a wish spell from an archmage that reverted him back to his male form.
In 1368 DR, an ogre bandit was ambushing travelers on the Sword Coasts roads to the east from Candlekeep and north off the Friendly Arm inn. The ogre was obsessed with belts ripped off the bodies of travelers and adventurers he came across. The collection included a girdle of masculinity/femininity and Unsheys Elves Bane magic belt.
