        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a strange and powerful [[polar bear]] found its way into the jungles outside the lost city of [[Omu]]. The beast, known as [[Polaris (bear)|Polaris]], was considered to be an impressive hunter's trophy to claim offered to various adventurers who ventured into Chult's jungles. As a reward for the beast's demise, the adventures were promised a ''Fured Kiuno of the Bear''."
