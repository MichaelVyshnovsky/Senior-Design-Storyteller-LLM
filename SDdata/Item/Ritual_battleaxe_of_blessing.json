        "mainbody": "Ritual battleaxes of blessing were dwarven enchanted ceremonial axes used for burial by the dwarfs of Myth Drannors Dwarven Dungeons.\nRitual battleaxes of blessing often appeared unused and lacking any signs of being used in battle. The axe itself had a harp double blade, perfectly capable of being wielded in combat.\nThese battleaxes had a +1 enchantment as well as gave the user the ability to cast bless.\nIn the days preceding the Weeping War, ritual battleaxes of blessing were laid along with dwarven warriors in the  burial coffins as a part of the final rites ceremony. By 1369 DR, some of these enchanted battleaxes could be found in the coffins left behind in the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor, left behind by the restless undead the fallen heroes became."
