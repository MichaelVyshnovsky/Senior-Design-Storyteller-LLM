        "mainbody": "The emerald stave was an enchanted artifact staff that once belonged to a yuan-ti Zehirite cultist IlFoss in the late 14 century DR.\nThe staff resembled a wearing sinuous snake.\nThis powerful artifact held a portion of IlFosss dark powers and because of that foul influence, only creatures who venerated evil could wield the emerald stave. Those who managed to tap into the weapons magic received a boon of increased intelligence. The staff also allowed the wielder to create undead once per day and afflict a creature with crushing despair once a day.\nIn the , yuan-ti who followed an interloper deity Zehir revealed their sinister intents for the Sword Coast. The yuan-ti House SeSehen began attacking the operations of House Sauringar and their Mercantile House trading organization led by SaSani. An attempt on her life took place in the Red Sheaf Inn, a roadside inn east of the city of Neverwinter. The attack was led by a cultist mage IlFoss who wielded the emerald stave. With the yuan-ti cultists likely dead, the staff changed hands. IlFosss powers still clang to the weapon even after leaving his possessions."
