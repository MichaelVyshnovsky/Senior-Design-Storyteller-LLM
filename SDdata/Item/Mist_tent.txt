A mist tent was a bizarre magic item that formed a usable tent when released.
The magical mist was contained in a small glass vial.
Once unstoppered, the mist expanded to form a single measuring  by  with a single flap opening in the front. The tent would dissipate if the vial was not immediately stoppered once the tent had formed. The mist tent had the density and appearance of a cloud when unoccupied. However, once occupied with the flap closed, the occupants and everything inside became invisible and the entire tent rose  off the ground if less than  of mass was held within the tent. The floor of the tent was transparent when viewed from within by the occupants.
Once the front flap was reopened, the entire tent became visible to outsiders and the tent would slowly descend to the ground. A mist tent was immune to all forms of fire, but that protection did not extend to any occupants. The tent would dissipate if it suffered enough physical harm and be permanently negated. However, the tent could be returned to the bottle if only slightly damaged to "heal." Opening the vial would return the mist tent within.
Specialty priests of Waukeen called goldeyes had a chance of receiving a mist tent as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy.
