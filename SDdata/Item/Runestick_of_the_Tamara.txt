The '''''Runestick of the Tamara''''' was a unique, powerful enchanted [[staff]] that unveiled its true magics in the hands of a servant of the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]].

==Powers==
The planar sorcery that empowered the ''Runestick of the Tamara'' allowed the wilder to comprehend and memorize a variety of additional [[arcane]] [[spell]]s each day. Simply holding the ''Runestick'' allows the owner to cast ''[[cat's grace]]'', ''[[endurance]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[haste]]'', and ''[[see invisibility]]'' spells. Any individual who did not serve the Tamara attempted to wield the staff, it was immediately consumed by magical flames.

==History==
The ''Runestick of the Tamara'' was entrusted to the dreaded [[Mother of a Thousand Young]] by her extraplanar masters â€“ the Tamara. In the Year of Tigers Curse, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Mother wielded the magic items against a band of heroes of the Living Jungles who infiltrated her base in attempts to stop the Mother from birthing a horde of ravenous [[spider katanga]].
