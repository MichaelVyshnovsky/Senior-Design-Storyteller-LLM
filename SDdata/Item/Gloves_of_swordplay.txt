'''''Gloves of swordplay''''' were [[magical item]]s that increased the wearer's aptitude with blades.

==Description==
The gloves appeared as simple leather gloves.

==Powers==
''Gloves of swordplay'' and their greater iteration increased the user's ability to safely parry incoming melee attacks.

==History==
The first ''gloves of swordplay'' were commissioned by [[Eisneid Clume]], a hapless dueler. She has been badly hurt in seven duels before she sought the help of magic. Once she started using these magical gloves, she won over thirty duels without a single scratch. Eventually, the rumors of her skill's origins led to the dramatic increase in swordplay skill all across [[Hillsfar]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Eisneid Clume]], the original owner.
