'''''Lost Time''''' was a [[potion]] formulated by the [[hag]] [[Ethel]], that lived within the [[Gnarled Teahouse]] in the [[Putrid Bog]] of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
The potion was entirely clear and kept within an old, cracked jug.

==Powers==
''Lost Time'' caused the drinker to act much slower than usual, lessening their reflexes and ability to move out of harm's way. These effects lasted for a duration of five minutes.

==History==
The only known jug of ''Lost Time'' could be found within Ethel's [[Ancient Abode]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
