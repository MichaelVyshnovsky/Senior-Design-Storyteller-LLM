'''Rune arms''', also known as '''arm cannons''', were ranged weapons used by [[artificer]]s to fire blasts of [[magic]]al energy.<ref name=DDO">

==Powers==
A rune arm could be charged up to fire a blast of magical energy of a particular type. Although this didn't require much concentration, standing still and focusing allowed wielders to prepare far more powerful blasts, at the cost of a lengthier recharging period.<ref name=DDO" />

In addition, equipped rune arms passively enhanced other wielded weapons with the same kind of magical energy used for firing.<ref name=DDO" />

==History==
On [[Eberron]], [[w:c:eberron:House Cannith|House Cannith]] was credited with the invention of rune arms.<ref name=DDO" /> However, when [[adventurer|adventuring]] artificers from this world crossed over to [[Toril]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, they were able to find that numerous rune arms already existed there.<ref name=DDO-MotU">

==Notable Rune Arms==
* An unnamed [[archaic device]], a rune arm that converted incoming [[element]]al damage into blasts of force.<ref name=DDO-MotU" />
* [[Arc welder]], an electricity-shooting variety of rune arm intended for welding metals together.<ref name=DDO-TMoT">
* ''[[Corruption of Nature]]'', an [[acid]]-spitting rune arm that conferred a more benign version of [[red musk creeper]] infection to its wielder.<ref name=DDO-TDD">
