        "mainbody": "'''Brigandine''' was a type of composite [[light armor]], a cross between [[studded leather]] and [[splint mail]] armors.",
        "Description": "A brigandine had undercoat, often made out of soft [[leather]], thick cloth, or rough canvas, and reinforced with leather plates with steel strips inside them. The leather plates were riveted to the the undercoat and another layer of cloth was affixed to the armor's exterior - its overcoat. This construction made brigandine a high lighter alternative to scale armor.\n\nThe cloth overcoat served three purposes: it reinforced the composition of brigandine and hid the armor's nature from the distance, appearing as regular [[tunic]]s, and it muffled the sound making brigandines quieter than chain and slit armor, but not as quiet as leathers or studded leathers. Comparatively to other armor types, brigandine was heavier but more flexible than [[hide armor]] while being stiffer but lighter than scale mail.\n\nSome makeshift brigandines were crafted by pirates and brigands out of ship sails, canvas sacks, [[coin]]s, and [[brass]] splitters. Even these makeshift brigandines offered good protection against slashing weapons.",
        "Availability": "* Armorers capable of making brigandine or modifying garments into it could be found in nearly all cities and towns in the Realms, as well as in many places along trade routes. Armorers capable of making it were also common in [[dwarf]], [[gnome]], and [[orc]] communities.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/Armor, Clothes, and Awful Jobs}}\n* [[Tethyrian]] brigands, namely a \"collective of demi-humans of diminutive stature\", a group of [[halfling]] bandits collecting toll from travelers, wore oversized brigandine corsets.\n* [[Sembia]]n nobles were known to wear brigandines underneath their [[robe]]s.\n* In the [[Blade Kingdoms]], brigandines were worn by the [[crossbow]]men guards of [[Colletro]].\n* Brigandines dated back to the time of the great empire of [[Netheril]] and were in common use.",
