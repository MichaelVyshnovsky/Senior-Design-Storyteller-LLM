        "mainbody": "Amulets of health were magical amulets worn around the neck that granted the wearer improved vigor and hardiness.\nMost of these amulets appeared as a golden disk hanging from a chain. The disk usually was engraved with the image of a lion or other powerful beast. They bore a transmutation aura of moderate strength.\nTo craft such an amulet required a skilled spellcaster with the ability to cast the bears endurance spell.\nAmulets of health could be crafted at various levels of power, which would enhance the wearers health by different factors.\nDepending on the power of the amulet, such an item could sell for as little as 4,000 gold pieces or as much as 36,000."
