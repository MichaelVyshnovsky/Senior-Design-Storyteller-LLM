A '''chakram''' was a small, ring-shaped throwing disk.

==Description==
Chakrams were flat metal{{Cite dragon/189/Rhino's Armor, Tiger's Claws|35}}) disks ranging from {{SI|5|in}} to {{SI|1|ft}} in radius with a sharpened rim and a rounded inner edge. They usually weighed between {{SIrange|0.5|2|lbs.}}. They were often covered in intricate engravings.

==Weaponology==
Chakrams were typically either thrown in a manner similar to a discus or spun around one's index finger and then released. Warriors typically carried these in groups of a half dozen, either around their arms or a conical [[turban]].

==Notable Users of Chakrams==
The chakram was the favored weapon of [[priest]]s of the goddess [[Shar]]. She was said to carry a magical chakram called the ''[[Disk of Night]]''.
