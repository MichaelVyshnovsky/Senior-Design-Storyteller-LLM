Jorils axe was a huge two-handed battleaxe that belonged to Joril Frostbeard of the Wyrms Tooth Glacier on the Spine of the World.
Jorils axe was a giant weapon with a thick  haft topped with a double-bitted axe blade. Created to be used by frost giants, Jorils axe was unwieldy. However, a skilled warrior could handle using this axe in battle, dealing devastating damage to their opponents.
Jorils axe was enchanted with several types of magics. In addition, it possessed a +3 enchantment and increased the users constitution in exchange for dexterity reduction.
Circa 1281 DR, Jorils axe belonged to Joril Frostbeard, a mighty frost giant leader, who lived with his clan in a cavern within the Wyrms Tooth glacier atop the Spine of the World.
