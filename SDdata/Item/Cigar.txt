Cigars were rolls made from Nexalan tabacco leaves, which could be smoked similarly to pipeweed.
The way cigars were made from rolling entire tabacco leaves was impossible to reproduce using pipeweed. The scent from smoking cigars was also richer and more pungent, and was said to provide great pleasure.
They were available for sale through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Cigars were popular among travelers returning from Maztica.
