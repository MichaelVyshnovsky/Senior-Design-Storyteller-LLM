'''''The Wall''''' was the holy relic of [[Helm]] and, arguably, one of the most powerful [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]]s in the Realms.

==Powers==
This shield possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment and made its wielder immune to acid, cold, electricity, and fire.

==History==
''The Wall'' once belonged to the great hero [[Karius]] of [[Luskan]]. He, according to legends, stood alone, unmoving in the face of an invading army of [[orc]]s. Karius and his tower shield stood in the beach of the city's northern wall as the invaders were trying o trike him down. Other legends told stories of valiant heroes standing against [[dragon]]s while being defended by ''the Wall.''

In [[1373 DR]], ''the Wall'' was in possession of the [[Zhentarim]] squad stationed in [[Iyrauroth]]'s swamp in [[Thar]].
