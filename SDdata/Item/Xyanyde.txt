'''''Xyanyde''''' was an enchanted [[mace]] from the [[Underdark]] that eventually came to be possessed by [[Minthara Baenre]] of the [[cult of the Absolute]].

==Description==
''Xyanyde's'' head was decorated with engravings of [[spider]]webs. This mace was uncannily cold to the touch.

==Powers==
''Xyanyde'' had the ability to light its opponents aflame with ''[[faerie fire]]''. This effect made it much easier to attack the opponents that were affected by it.

==History==
''Xyanyde'' was forged in the depths of Underdark by [[duergar]] slavers. By {{Yearlink|1492}}, this mace was in the possession of the cult of the Absolute's leader in the [[Shattered Sanctum]], [[Minthara Baenre]], who sought the downfall of the [[Emerald Grove]].
