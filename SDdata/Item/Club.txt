'''Clubs''' were a simple, one-handed type of melee weapon and one of the oldest known weapons in the Realms.

==Description==
Clubs were typically stout, hardwood sticks that narrowed at one end for gripping and widened at the other. However, the appearance of clubs and the materials used to construct them widely varied. Blunt wooden sticks could be considered clubs just as much as table legs, large branches, or tree trunks (in the case of some [[giants]] and other large creatures).

==Weaponology==
===Enchantment===
Clubs could carry any [[enchantment]] typical to other weapons, with the only limitation being the [[enchanter]]'s power and the material of the club itself. Spells, such as ''[[Shillelagh]],'' could either mimic a club's effects or create powerful magical weapons.

==Varieties==
;Aklys:
: A short, weighted club with a cord or thong attached to its butt that measured {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in length. It was wielded by fastening the cord or thong around the user's wrist or a [[gauntlet]]. Though it could be used simply as a blunt instrument, the aklys was designed to be thrown at enemies from afar and then retrieved by means of its cord.<ref> This weapon was widely wielded by members of the [[derro]] clan [[Clan Arzhoun|Arzhoun]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/20/The Ship of Night|7,10-11,21-22}}
;Chokhor modo:
: Used by the [[Igidujin]] tribe of the [[Plain of Horses]], this was a {{SIAdj|3|foot|long=yes|adj=long}} club with leather loops on the shaft. It could be swung forward and snapped back to attack in two directions.
;[[Greatclub]]:
: Large clubs that most creatures required both hands to wield.
;[[Kerrie]]:
: A weighted club that was used primarily as a throwing weapon. It was typically found in the land of [[Chult]].
;[[Maca]]:
: A type of club that originated in the land of [[Maztica]] and was sometimes considered to be an alternative to the [[longsword]].
;Sidam
: Used by the Igidujin tribe of the Plain of Horses, similar to the ''chokhor modo'', this club had leather loops on the shaft and was designed for throwing.
