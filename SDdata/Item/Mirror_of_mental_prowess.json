The destination needed to first be scryed and afterwards an invisible area remained on the \"other side\" that acted as a portal back. This portal would close once the owner returned, once the owner used a command word, or otherwise would close itself after a period of 24 hours.\n* Once per week, the mirror could be made to accurately answer a short question regarding a creature whose image was shown upon its surface.\nCirca 1357 DR,While the exact year is not stated, Pwyll Daggerford became Duke after his fathers death in the First Dragonspear War of 1356 DR. a mirror of mental prowess stood within a temple of Moradin inside Illefarn.\nIn 1367 DR, a large mirror of mental prowess stood within the library of Zarastros castle on Zarastro Isle that was guarded by the green hag Xana.\n* Almari bint-Kafira and Prince Tannous al-Assad each had a mirror of mental prowess that they used to communicate with each other.\n* Casimir\n* Celedon Kierney\n* Cyndre\n* Fayiz Mikali\n* Maldraedior owned a mirror of mental prowess with continual light cast upon it, allowing him to scry the Temple of the Wyrm.\n* Sydney\n* The darkweaver Valastigor had a mirror of mental prowess that was half-submerged within the center of Androlynnes swamp, the Fen of Ill Odor.
