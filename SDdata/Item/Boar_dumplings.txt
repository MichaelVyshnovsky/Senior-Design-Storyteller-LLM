'''Boar dumplings''' was one of the staples served at the [[Arnise Hold]] to its guests in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These dumplings were made using wild [[boar]] meat.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-29 - Arnise Hold Food}} The dish was considered the menu's mainstay due to its low price and popularity among those of humble means. Boar dumplings could be found in the Arnise Hold's rustic guesthouse, seven along other surprisingly good foods.
