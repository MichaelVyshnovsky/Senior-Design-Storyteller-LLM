The '''''Eye of Selûne''''' was a magical [[mirror]] in the [[House of the Moon]] temple to the [[Selûne|Lady of Silver]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Mounted on the wall at the western end of the transept in the Hall of Wind and Waves, on the third floor of the temple, it was an enormous circular mirror with a cracked glass and aged appearance. Its frame was {{SI|6|inch|c|long=yes}} wide and inscribed with magical runes. On either side were curtains of deep purple hue; presumably, these could be drawn across to cover the mirror.

==Powers==
The ''Eye of Selûne'' could be used to [[scry]] upon any place on [[Toril]], provided it was illuminated by the [[moon]]'s light at the time. In contrast to traditional methods of scrying, such as a ''[[crystal ball]]'', success was not dependent on the user's experience or knowledge of the subject, but on the illumination, position in the sky, and phase of the moon. All else being equal, a full moon had a 100% likelihood of succeeding, whereas a half moon had only a 50% chance, and so on. Moreover, it could be used as often and for as long as desired, the only limitation being of course the moon. It could be used by Selûnite priest instructed in how to use it.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the ''Eye of Selûne'' was employed by the goddess [[Shar]], then posing as the [[avatar]] of the Moonmaiden, to scry on [[Luna]], who was the true avatar of Selûne.<ref>{{Cite comic/Selune Rising|0}}<ref group="note">While this is not depicted in the comic itself, the cover art of ''Selune Rising'' shows a device that was clearly the inspiration for the ''Eye of Selûne'' in the later ''Powers & Pantheons'', and hence this is included here.
