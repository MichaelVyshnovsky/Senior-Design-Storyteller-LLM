'''Serpentine''' was the name given to a family of related materials that included '''williamsite''', '''ricolite''', '''[[wikipedia:en:verde antique|verde antique]]''', '''picrolite''', '''taxoite''', '''[[wikipedia:en:bowenite|bowenite]]''', and sometimes referred to as "poor man's jade". Top quality samples of williamsite were classified as [[semi-precious stones]] and all other varieties were treated as [[hardstones]] sold under the name [[serpentine stone]].

==Description==
Gem quality serpentine was translucent with an intense green color and could be facet cut or made into [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]]s to decorate weapons, armor, and [[barding]] or mounted in rings, pendants, and [[jewelry]] of all types. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 [[gold piece]]s.

==Powers==
Carrying, wearing, or being in contact with a gemstone of this type (williamsite) could confer the equivalent of a ''[[resist cold]]'' and a ''[[resist fire]]'' to that individual. If more than one serpentine gem was present, only one stone activated per exposure to extreme heat or cold at a time. Each gem could protect against one cold effect and one heat effect before crumbling to useless dust.
