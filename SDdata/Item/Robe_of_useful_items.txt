A '''''robe of useful items''''' was a [[magical]] [[robe]] that provided the wearer with handy tools and equipment at a moment's notice.

==Powers==
The robe was adorned with numerous small patches representing the items held by it, but only the wearer could see or use them. When needed, the wearer could detach a patch, upon which it would become a real and hopefully useful item.

A wide array of items could be produced from a ''robe of useful items''. Every such robe was made with some of the following basic useful patches.
* A [[dagger]].
* A lit [[bullseye lantern]] filled with [[oil]].
* A 2-by-4-foot [[steel]] [[mirror]].
* A {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes}} [[pole]].
* {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} of [[hemp]]en [[rope]].
* A large [[sack]].

They were also made with a few more unusual patches.
* A pouch of 100 [[gp]].
* A 1-foot long, 6-inch deep and wide [[silver]] coffer worth 500 [[gp]].
* A self-fitting barred [[iron]] door up to {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes}} wide and tall that installed itself into a doorframe-shaped space.
* Ten [[gems]] worth 100 gp each.
* A {{SIAdj|24|foot|long=yes}} long wooden [[ladder]].
* A living [[mule]] or [[horse]] with [[saddlebag]]s.
* A {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes}} wide pit that affixed to the floor and opened up a void.
* ''[[Potion of healing|Potions of healing]]'', ''[[potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]'', or ''[[cure serious wounds]]''.
* A {{SIAdj|12|foot|long=yes}} long [[rowboat]].
* A random lesser [[spell scroll]].
* A pair of living [[war dog]]s.
* A 2-by-4-foot [[glass]] window that attached to a wall and opened a window frame through it.
* A portable ram.
