A robe of useful items was a magical robe that provided the wearer with handy tools and equipment at a moments notice.
The robe was adorned with numerous small patches representing the items held by it, but only the wearer could see or use them. When needed, the wearer could detach a patch, upon which it would become a real and hopefully useful item.
