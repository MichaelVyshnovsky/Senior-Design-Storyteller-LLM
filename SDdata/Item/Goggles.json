        "mainbody": "Goggles were a kind of headwear that covered the eyes in a practical and protective manner.\nGoggles resembled spectacles, though with a much tighter fit that enclosed the eyes completely. The lenses were usually cut from glass and the headband made of a leather or heavy-duty cloth.\nGoggles protected the wearers eyes from all sorts of hazards, such as flying insects, noxious gases, dust, high-speed winds, and many other airborne hazards. The lenses could even be of special concave or convex designs that functioned as spectacles for a short- or long-sighted wearer.\nIn addition to their other properties, magical goggles were usually made to resize to fit widely ranging head sizes, allowing most people to easily wear them provided they had a human-like skull shape.\n* Goggles of astral seeing, which improved vision in the Astral Plane.\n* Goggles of minute seeing, a helmet that included magnifying lenses.\n* Goggles of night, which granted the wearer a form of darkvision.\n* Malchors undersun goggles, which greatly improved low-light vision in the Underdark.\n* Knight Vision Goggles, which made the wearer look like a knight.\n* Shadowsight, a Shadovar device that saw partway into the Shadowfell."
