        "mainbody": "The '''Dusty Rat ''portal''''' was an odd ''[[portal]]'' from [[Amn]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/One-Way Portals in Amn}}",
        "Description": "The ''Dusty Rat portal'' was a 10-feet-by-10-feet (3-meters-by-3-meters) square ''portal''.",
        "Powers": "The ''Dusty Rat portal'' was a creature-only one-way ''portal'' that transported people from the [[Dusty Rat bar]] in [[Athkatla]] to a tower somewhere on the [[Dragon Coast]] where the [[vampire]] [[Theserin]] lived. Those fell on the ground at the origin point in the cellar of the Dusty Rat bar.",
        "History": "The ''portal'' was discovered by [[Baldy Spryth]], the owner of the Dusty Rat bar, in the cellar of his own bar. He had no idea about its destination and hired a [[fighter]] and [[wizard]] to investigate where it went. They disappeared and left all of their equipment behind. While Baldy Spryth still lacked the knowledge about the ''portal's'' destination, after seeing that both the fighter and wizard did not return, he concocted a money-making scam. He spread the rumor that he had a ''portal'' to another dimension, which people could use for fee. Those people disappeared and Baldy Spryth made money by selling off their equipment and became rich.",
        "Reputation": "Baldy Spryth spread the rumor that he owned a ''portal'' to another dimension. However, it was quite an obscure rumor.",
        "Notable Owners": "As mentioned above, the ''portal'' was owned by Baldy Spryth who had no idea where it led. On the other side, there was the vampire Theserin who killed people who came through it."
