        "mainbody": "'''''Sarghathuld''''', or '''\"Orcbane\"''', was a legendary magical [[sword]] forged by [[dwarves]] to slay [[orc]]s, before becoming a sword of a king's royal guard, then finally a prize to a [[dragon]], adventurers, and knights.",
        "Description": "''Sarghathuld'' was a [[short sword]] forged of \"[[orcslayer]]\" metal, which was of dull gray hue. \"Sarghathuld\" was etched in [[Dethek]] runes on one side of the blade, while \"Orcbane\" was etched on the other side. A glowing gemstone was embedded in the pommel.According to [[Dwarvish dictionary|dwarven words]] given in ''[[Dwarves Deep]]'', \"''sarghathuld''\" apparently means \"orc bane\". This is apparently confirmed in ''[[Champions of Valor]]'', which names the sword \"''Sarghathuld'' (Orcbane)\". It is not clear what language or script \"Orcbane\" on the other side is written in, nor which appears in the image.",
        "Powers": "''Sarghathuld'' was made of orcslayer, an alloy of steel that was poisonous to [[orc]]s. With a ''+1'' enchantment, it was also an [[bane (property)|''orc bane'']] weapon, so its touch was lethal to [[orc]]-kind.\n\nThe glowing stone in the pommel continuously radiated light equivalent to a ''[[daylight]]'' [[spell]]. It could be blocked by covering the pommel.\n\nThe weapon could also be made to unleash a powerful beam of energy at will, which blasted whatever it touched.\n\nThe sword's magical powers came from the glowing gemstone in the pommel. Sages believed that even attempting to remove the stone would cause both it and the sword to lose all these powers.",
        "History": "Master Smith [[Fyrfar Smokebeard]] forged ''Sarghathuld'' in the [[605 DR|Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR]]. This was one of over a thousand [[orcslayer]] weapons made over several years at the order of [[Deep King]] [[Tuir Stonebeard]], in an effort to destroy the orcish realm of [[Vastar]]. ''Sarghathuld'' and the other weapons were enchanted by [[High Old One]] [[Turbaern]], Blood Axe of [[Clangeddin]], who was assisted by the [[human]] mage [[Beldossan]] and the [[elf|elven]] sorceress [[Aleratha Ilnatar]].\n\n''Sarghathuld'' was granted to [[Ulnorn]], a dwarven warrior. Wielding Orcbane, Ulnorn fought with courage in the dwarven battles against Vastar's orcs, culminating in that realm's fall in the [[610 DR|Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR]] and the rise of the dwarven kingdom of [[Roldilar]].\n\nUlnorn later journeyed to [[Myth Drannor]] in its heyday, and there dwarven craftsmen and elven mages further enchanted ''Sarghathuld''. But with the fall of Myth Drannor in the [[714 DR|Year of Doom, 714 DR]], ''Sarghathuld'' disappeared from history for almost twenty years.\n\nBut ''Sarghathuld'' found its way back into dwarven hands, and in the [[734 DR|Year of the Splendid Stag, 734 DR]], [[Ironlord]] [[Barundar mac Idrin]] of [[Earthfast]] presented ''Sarghathuld'' as a gift to King [[Halanter Elethlim|Halanter I]] of [[Impiltur]] on his coronation. Halanter was known as ''Arausamman'', or \"great friend\", to the dwarves of Earthfast, and was the first Impilturan ruler to make a pact with them.\n\n''Sarghathuld'' lay in Impiltur's [[Royal Vaults]] for some time, and was eventually collected by [[Mage Royal]] [[Soargar]] in his tower as part of his mission to preserve the treasures of Old Impiltur as the realm fractured. He granted the collection, known as [[Soargar's Legacy]], to [[Imphras I]] in the [[1095 DR|Year of the Dawn Dance, 1095 DR]]. ''Sarghathuld'' was one among a hundred-or-so magical weapons in the collection. These were granted to Imphras's loyal battle companions, who later became his [[Royal Guard]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|86}}\n\n''Sarghathuld'' remained in the hands of the Royal Guard until the [[1127 DR|Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR]]. King [[Imbrar I]] led the Royal Guard and a troop of soldiers against the [[hobgoblins]] of the [[Giantspire Mountains]]â€”and all vanished without a trace. ''Sarghathuld'' and the other enchanted weapons were thought lost.\n\n''Sarghathuld'' resurfaced a century and a half later, when [[Kesten Orthalin]] of the [[Grimblades]] adventuring company had the sage [[Arthylmas]] of [[Saerloon]] identify the blade. Given the Grimblades' activities, ''Sarghathuld'' may have been plundered from some ruin in the lands around the eastern [[Inner Sea]]. Shortly after, however, the Grimblades were slain by the [[green dragon]] [[Urnalithorgathla]] in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in the [[Dalelands]] and ''Sarghathuld'' lay another ninety years in her hoard.\n\nFinally, a force of dwarves slew Urnalithorgathla, and their leader, [[Borlin]], claimed ''Sarghathuld'' to wield in battle. In the [[1364 DR|Year of the Wave, 1364 DR]], Borlin led the [[Mithril Legion]] on a quest to reclaim the lost [[Mines of Tethyamar]] by the Dalelands. Then they, too, disappeared, and ''Sarghathuld'' with them.\n\n[[Othiiyr Velthrann]], a [[sage]] from the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]], made his life's work the study of the magic swords of Soargar's Legacy. Othiiyr dedicated himself to recording the legends around them, and pieced together the history of ''Sarghathuld'' and other blades. Othiiyr assisted the [[Knights of Imphras II]] in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargar's Legacy. ''Sarghathuld'' remained missing by the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], but the Knights were working to recover it.",
