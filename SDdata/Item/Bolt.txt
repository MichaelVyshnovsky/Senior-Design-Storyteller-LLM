A '''bolt''', sometimes called a '''quarrel''', was a type of ammunition that was fired from a [[crossbow]].

==Description==
Bolts came in various shapes and sizes. They could also be wielded as a melee [[weapon]], but were tiny, and thus didn't do much damage. Bolts came in wooden cases that held ten of them.

Like [[arrow]]s, some bolts were [[magical|enchanted]] in some way so they could deal more damage, [[Dispel magic|dispel]], [[blind]], or [[silence]] their target. A [[Crossbow#Repeating crossbow|repeating crossbow]] could hold five bolts in a clip.

==Notable Bolts==
* ''[[Bolt of power]]''
* ''[[Shiver-strike]]''
* ''[[Stun bolt]]''
