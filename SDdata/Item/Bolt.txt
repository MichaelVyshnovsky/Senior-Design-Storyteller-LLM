A bolt, sometimes called a quarrel, was a type of ammunition that was fired from a crossbow.
Bolts came in various shapes and sizes. They could also be wielded as a melee weapon, but were tiny, and thus didnt do much damage. Bolts came in wooden cases that held ten of them.
Like arrows, some bolts were enchanted in some way so they could deal more damage, dispel, blind, or silence their target. A repeating crossbow could hold five bolts in a clip.
