        "Description": "A material component consisted of one or more physical objects or substances. Depending on the spell, once it was cast, the material component was annihilated. However, a spellcaster could often use a [[spellcasting focus]] to substitute for most components, which would not be consumed by the spell. Casters who wielded [[priest]]ly magic usually used a [[divine focus]] such as a [[holy symbol]], which had higher spiritual significance than the standard focus, while [[druid]]s often employed a [[druidic focus]].\n\n[[Arcane spellcaster]]s usually employed component pouches with individual compartments to store most material components required for their spells, unless they chose to employ an [[arcane focus]] instead.\n\nValuable or rare material components often had to be stored separately and could not be replaced by a focus."
