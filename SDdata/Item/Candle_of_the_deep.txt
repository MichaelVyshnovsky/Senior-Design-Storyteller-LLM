A candle of the deep was a magical candle that continued to burn even if immersed in water.
Candles of the deep burned at the same rate and gave off the same luminosity as ordinary candles.
Even if completely submerged, a candle of the deep did not stop burning.
The marid Ichthyglug offered a candle of the deep as part of a reward to adventurers who brought him the phylactery of the lich Ezzat.
