'''''Stones of alarm''''' were enchanted stones that could emit ear-piercing bellow of alarm if activated without uttering the stone's ''command word''.

==Description==
These tiny items were usually shaped like cubes and carved out of stone.

''Stones of alarm'' were a part of a safe rest adventurers' kit, alongside with six [[bedroll]], six [[ghostwall shellac]]s, one [[hammer]], five [[iron]] spikes, and a [[waterskin]]. Together, the entire kit was valued at 3,622 [[gold]] pieces.

==Powers==
With uttering a ''stone of alarm's'' unique ''command word'', it was magically affixed onto an item or a surface. When the guarded item was touched without saying the same ''command word'', a ''stone of alarm'' started blareing a screech that could be heard from as far as a quarter of a mile, or {{SI|1320'|'"|long=yes}}.

==Creation==
Creating these [[enchanted]] rocks was relatively easy for a skilled wondrous item crafter. A scroll or a spell of the ''[[alarm]]'' spell was the part of the item's creation process.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1371 DR]], ''stones of alarm''' were a common enchanted item found in the magic shops of the [[City of Grodd]], on the demi plane of [[Grodd]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Tarbash Dellkisel]]: a gnome adventurer who aided a group of heroes against [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].
