        "mainbody": "Caltrops were effective items used by some rogues and adventurers to dissuade pursuit.\nCaltrops were known to come in a variety of shapes and sizes, though typically they had a spherical shape and were lined with either four or six spikes or prongs. These spikes were typically arranged in a tetrahedral pattern, which ensured that when tossed there would always be a spike facing up regardless of how a caltrop landed.\nWhen dropped on the ground during a pursuit, caltrops did a wonderful job of slowing down and even injuring the pursuing party, allowing a thief extra time to make his or her escape.\nThough they were surely independently made in other lands of Toril, caltrops were known throughout the north to have been invented in Sundabar. They were a popular export of the Old Anvil Smithy within the city.\nPirates of the Nelanther Isles often used shattered rum bottles as caltrops."
