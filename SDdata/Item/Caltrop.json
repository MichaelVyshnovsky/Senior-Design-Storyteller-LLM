        "mainbody": "'''Caltrops''' were effective items used by some [[rogue]]s and adventurers to dissuade pursuit.",
        "Description": "Caltrops were known to come in a variety of shapes and sizes, though typically they had a spherical shape and were lined with either four or six spikes or prongs. These spikes were typically arranged in a tetrahedral pattern, which ensured that when tossed there would always be a spike facing up regardless of how a caltrop landed.{{Cite dragon/61/Or with a weird one|20}}",
        "Weaponology": "When dropped on the ground during a pursuit, caltrops did a wonderful job of slowing down and even injuring the pursuing party, allowing a thief extra time to make his or her escape.",
        "Locations": "Though they were surely independently made in other lands of [[Toril]], ''caltrops'' were known throughout [[the north]] to have been invented in [[Sundabar]]. They were a popular export of the [[Old Anvil Smithy]] within the city.\n\nPirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]] often used shattered [[rum]] [[bottle]]s as caltrops."
