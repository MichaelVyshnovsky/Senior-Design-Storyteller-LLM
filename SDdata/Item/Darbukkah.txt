The '''''darbukkah''''' ({{Pronounce|dar|BOOK|kah}}) was a medium-sized [[Zakhara|Zakharan]] [[drum]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
The ''darbukkah'' was a vase-shaped drum that was wider at the top. Most ''darbukkah'' stood 2 feet high and were played while kneeling. However, the great ''darbukkahs'' of the [[Afyal|Isle of the Elephant]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] measured 4 feet high and were played while either standing or when the drum was mounted on the side of an [[elephant]].

''Darbukkah'' were carved from hard wood and adorned with decorative artistry by master craftsmen. The head was made from the tanned hides of jungle creatures.
