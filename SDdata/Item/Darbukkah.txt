The darbukkah () was a medium-sized Zakharan drum.
The darbukkah was a vase-shaped drum that was wider at the top. Most darbukkah stood 2 feet high and were played while kneeling. However, the great darbukkahs of the Isle of the Elephant in the Ruined Kingdoms measured 4 feet high and were played while either standing or when the drum was mounted on the side of an elephant.
Darbukkah were carved from hard wood and adorned with decorative artistry by master craftsmen. The head was made from the tanned hides of jungle creatures.
