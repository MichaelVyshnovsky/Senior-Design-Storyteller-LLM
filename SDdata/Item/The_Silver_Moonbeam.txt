The Silver Moonbeam was a variety of wine served at the Silvermoon Playhouse of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
The Silver Moonbeam was pressed and fermented out of grapes native to the Vast. The harvest was only done under the full moon, which, according to the vintners, added divine robustness to its flavor.
