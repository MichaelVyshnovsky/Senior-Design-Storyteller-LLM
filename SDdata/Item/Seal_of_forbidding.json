        "mainbody": "The '''''seal of forbidding''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[coin]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Farideh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "The coin was heavy and made of an unidentified metal alloy. It let off a constant pulse of heat that was uncomfortably hot to the touch for any but Farideh. Silverhand claimed that this was meant to always remind her of what she had paid and what she had gained from her [[warlock]] pact.",
        "Powers": "The coin allowed Farideh to ''[[Bestow curse|bestow a curse]]'' on her enemies.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Farideh, a [[tiefling]] warlock to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[sickle of shorn bonds]]''."
