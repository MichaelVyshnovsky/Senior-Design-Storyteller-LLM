        "mainbody": "he seal of forbidding was a unique enchanted coin crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Farideh in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nThe coin was heavy and made of an unidentified metal alloy. It let off a constant pulse of heat that was uncomfortably hot to the touch for any but Farideh. Silverhand claimed that this was meant to always remind her of what she had paid and what she had gained from her warlock pact.\nThe coin allowed Farideh to bestow a curse on her enemies.\n* Farideh, a tiefling warlock to whom Silverhand also gifted the sickle of shorn bonds."
