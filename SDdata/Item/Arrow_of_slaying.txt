'''''Arrows of slaying''''' were [[Magic weapon|magically]] enchanted [[arrow]]s designed to kill one particular type of target.

==Description==
Several different types of ''arrows of slaying'' existed, meant for a wide variety of targets, with varying degrees of specificity. For example, while very specific ''arrows of blue dragon slaying'' existed, it was also common to find more vague ''arrows of dragon slaying''.

Other, less common variants of this type of projectile existed, such as ''[[bolt of slaying|bolts of slaying]]'', intended to be used in [[crossbow]]s.

==Powers==
When an ''arrow of slaying'' hit its intended target, it caused a devastating amount of damage, some of which could be resisted by the target. After one hit, the enchantment ended and the ''arrow of slaying'' became an ordinary arrow.

==Notable ''Arrows of Slaying''==
During the council of [[metallic dragon]]s led by [[Protanther]] in the [[Nether Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a few members of the council considered awarding ''arrows of dragon slaying'' to adventurers in their quest to prevent the return of [[Tiamat]] at the hands of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Olwen Forest-Friend]] owned two ''arrows of demon slaying'' and a single ''arrow of giant slaying'' during the [[Bloodstone Wars]].<ref>
