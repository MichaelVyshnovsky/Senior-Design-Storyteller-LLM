'''''Xainlaphar's flying skulls''''' were grizzly explosive [[enchanted]] weapons created out of [[humanoid]] skulls.

==Powers==
''Xainlaphar's flying skulls'' functioned in a manner similar to the ''[[skulltrap]]'' [[spell]] but offensively. These flying skulls could be unleashed to fly toward the enemies, where they exploded in magical flames and bone shrapnel, dealing grave damage to everything within four feet of the skull.

==History==
[[Xainlaphar]], a mad [[Red Wizard]], was known for turning the heads of his slain enemies into [[enchanted]] destructive weapons, later to be named ''Xainlaphar's flying skulls''. Xainlaphar created a number of these skulls before dying in the {{YearlinkName|913}}, leaving behind more than half of the total number unused. Soon after, the ''flying skulls'' were claimed by Xainlaphar's enemies—a [[cleric]] and a [[paladin]] of [[Helm]]. The [[Helmite]]s intended to destroy these foul weapons, but at least forty of them were stolen on the way to [[Sembia]]. Xainlaphar's legacy still existed as of the {{YearlinkName|1281}} as one of these explosive skulls belonged to an exiled [[Arcane Brotherhood]] [[mage]] of [[Lonelywood]] named [[Kieran Nye]].
