'''Girdles of Priestly Might''' were magical items that could be found in [[Halruaa]].

==History==
These items only appeared after the [[Time of Troubles]]. Halruaans believed this to be a clear sign that their goddess [[Mystra]] had finally regained her powers. The existence of these items was one of the reasons that the worship of [[Azuth]] did not gain more support from Halruaa.

==Description==
Each girdle was marked with a symbol of good or evil that was bonded to its front. Someone attempting to wear a girdle that opposed the true nature of their heart was cursed, effectively blocking that [[priest]] from receiving all but the most basic spells from their god or goddess until an ''[[atonement]]'' spell was cast upon them.

==Powers==
Three versions of this magical item existed:
*Girdle of Priestly Might
*Girdle of Priestly Warding
*Girdle of Holy Might

===Girdle of Priestly Might===
This item imbued the wearer with the physical strength of a fierce warrior and helped protect them against attacks.

===Girdle of Priestly Warding===
In addition to the powers granted by the Girdle of Priestly Might, this girdle protected the wearer against [[evil]] or [[good]].

===Girdle of Holy Might===
This girdle granted the powers of the previous two girdles while also granting the wearer the ability to use the ''[[word of recall]]'' spell once per month.
