        "mainbody": "In Faer√ªn, andar was the name for andalusite, a semi-precious stone usually found in streambeds as tumbled pebbles or crystals with an average diameter of  in (13 mm).\nAndar was a durable gemstone that could be facet-cut by a skilled lapidarist to produce translucent gems with a green-red or brown-red flash. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.\nCombining powdered andar with a dragon scale (gold, silver, or amethyst) and boiling produced an alternate ingredient that could be added to the oily base of a potion of treasure finding."
