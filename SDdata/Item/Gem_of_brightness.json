The first command caused the gem to shed light that was bright enough to read by out to a range of , similarly to a hooded lantern. The second command fired a burst of light directed at a creature within a range of , potentially blinding the creature temporarily. The third command produced a flare that extended in a cone out to a range of , potentially blinding everyone caught in that area.\nThe first power could be used at will and was never expended, as long as the gem still contained some of its magic. The second and third commands drained the gem of its magic and could only be used a limited number of times. Once the gem of brightness was completely drained, it became an ordinary gem worth 50 gp.\n*The dao Jar√ªk offered a gem of brightness as part of a reward to adventurers who brought him the phylactery of the lich Ezzat.\n*Judge Olreff of the temple of Tyr in Neverwinter was selling a gem of brightness in 1374 DR.\n*Liam Sunmist of the temple of Lathander in Daggerfoord was selling on of the gems in 1372 DR."
