A '''''conch of teleportation''''' was a device that allowed flawless teleportation to a single specified location.

==Description==
The item was a large [[conch]] shell upon which the [[Giant_dictionary#U|uvar]] ("storm") rune had been carved. ''Conches of teleportation'' were typically about 2.5 ft (76 cm) in length.

==Powers==
The item allowed the user to cast the ''[[teleport]]'' spell once to the location determined by the item's creator, who had inscribed the uvar rune on the shell. The spell always brought any creatures it transported flawlessly to the designated location with no chance of error. The ''conch'' regained its magic at dawn.
