Hill Cleaver was a peculiarly shaped magical saurial broadsword famously wielded by Dragonbait.
Hill Cleavers shape appeared alien to the people of Toril as its design was from the saurials homeworld. The swords small hilt was created for slender hands. Its blade ended in a wide wedge with serrated teeth on the hilt-ward side.
The sword was exceptionally hard to handle for Humans until they gained proficiency with the saurial broadsword.
Hill Cleaver was effectively a +2 holy avenger that could dispel magic at the same level as the wielder on command. The blade also provided magic resistance out to a radius of , and inflicted additional damage when wielded against chaotic evil opponents.
Only non-evil creatures could wield Hill Cleaver without feeling pain.

Hill Cleaver arrived in Toril in , alongside its owner, Dragonbait, when he was captured by Phalse and the Fire Knives in an attempt to use him to create a perfect assassin construct. While Dragonbait was a prisoner of the evil alliance, Hill Cleaver was given to Finder Wyvernspur as he was the only one who could wield the weapon without feeling excruciating pain. When Finder aided Alias and Dragonbaits escape, the sword was returned to its saurial owner.
During that year the magical sword proved to be indispensable, vanquishing fearsome foes like the ancient red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco, a mineral quasi-elemental, the demon Phalse, and the Abomination of Moander.
In the final confrontation with Phalse, Hill Cleaver was lost when Alias threw both the demon and the sword into the Positive Energy plane where Phalse exploded.
It was possible that the saurials of the Lost Vale eventually created more holy swords after they were freed from Moanders corrupting influence in 1358 DR.
