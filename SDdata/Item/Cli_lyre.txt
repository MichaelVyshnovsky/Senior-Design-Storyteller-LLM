A Cli lyre () was a masterwork magic lyre and one of the Instruments of the Bards.
Cli lyres were superior in every way to ordinary lyres. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.
Bards wielding a Cli lyre had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.
Like all Instruments of the Bards, these lyres had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Cli lyre could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, stone shape, wall of fire and wind wall each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.
Lesser versions of Cli lyres allowed for casting the haste, remove curse, and sound burst spells.
The first Cli lyres were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Cli level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.
Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor.
Circa 1372 DR several powerful magical items, including a Cli lyre, were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who perched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liams Hold.
A mundane but exquisitely crafted Falataeric Cli lyre was sold at the Chromatic Scale of Baldurs Gate in the . It was believed that it was one of the twenty surviving lyres hand-crafted by Falataer of the Moonshaes.
