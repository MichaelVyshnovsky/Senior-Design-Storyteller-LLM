        "mainbody": "A piercing songblade was an enchanted sword meant to be wielded by a bard.\nAny heavy or light blade could be enchanted to become a piercing songblade. Such a blade was silent when wielded, but released a piercing musical note upon striking a target.\nLike other songblades, piercing songblades were magically sharp and strong weapons that could be used as an implement for bardic spellcasting.\nWhen wielded by a bard, the piercing note released by the blade could literally pierce and rend an opponents armor.\n* Zaol, a fallen angel of vengeance who dual-wielded a piercing songblade longsword and an aegis blade."
