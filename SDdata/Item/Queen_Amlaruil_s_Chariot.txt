Queen Amlaruils Chariot was a wondrous unique magic item from the island of Evermeet.
The chariot was usually pulled by a pair of unicorns or pegasi.
The chariot protected any riders by making it much more difficult for incoming attacks to strike them. Additionally, the magic of the chariot increased the likeliness of a riders ranged attacks striking true and causing more physical harm. The chariot and any riders could teleport without error once per day.
Queen Amlaruil Moonflower used this chariot for her personal transportation.
