'''Star Ruby''' was a rare form of red corundum that exhibited [[wikipedia:en:asterism|asterism]].

==Description==
Star rubies were more opaque than regular gem-quality [[ruby|rubies]] and had a reflective optical effect that highlighted a white six-pointed star on the surface of cabochon-cut stones. Other stars with even-numbered points were also possible. About one out of every one hundred rubies was a star ruby. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp or 1,000 gp depending on market conditions.

Star rubies were considered sacred by followers of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Labelas Enoreth]], and [[Shargaas]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10, 12, 14}}

==Powers==
Star rubies shared all the properties of plain rubies plus some very unique healing abilities. This jewel could be used to create a superlative healing vapor that when inhaled delivered the combined effects of:
* ''[[elixir of health]]'' (cured blindness, deafness, poisoning, infestation, rot, and mental disorders)
* ''[[heal]]'' (restored full health)
* ''[[regenerate]]'' (began regrowing lost body parts)
The star ruby first had to be subjected to a ''[[knock]]'' spell and then ''[[wraithform]]'' had to be cast on it, creating a thick, red vapor. This remedy was known to work on mammalian creatures, but it was unknown how it affected non-mammals.

==Reputation==
Star rubies were considered prized gems among the [[drow]]. They considered it somewhat of a lucky charm for those who could use [[magic]] and a very bold choice for others. It was particularly used by old priestesses.
