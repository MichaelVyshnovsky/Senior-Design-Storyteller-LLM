        "mainbody": "'''''Darts of homing''''' were enchanted projectile weapons capable of returning to the wielder's hand when thrown.",
        "Powers": "The [[magic]] enchanting these weapons made them more likely to strike true and cause more physical harm upon doing so. Upon successfully striking the intended target, a ''dart of homing'' would instantly return to the wielder's hand and could be thrown again without hesitation. However, if one of these [[dart]]s missed their intended target then their enchantment was lost.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Donar Heremet]], a [[thief]] inhabiting the city of [[Waterdeep]], carried a ''dagger of homing''."
