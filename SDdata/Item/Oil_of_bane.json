        "mainbody": "'''''Oil of bane''''' was a type of [[magic]] [[oil]] that temporarily rendered the target of its application unlucky and clumsy.",
        "Description": "The substance's sweet scent left a feeling of foolishness, ill-preparedness, and unworthy in those who inhaled it.",
        "Powers": "''Oil of bane'' was used to coat weapons as those who received a successful strike from such weapons fell under the effects similar to that of the ''[[bane]]'' [[spell]]. Similar effects could be achieved by throwing an ''oil of bane'' vial at an opponent.",
        "Creation": "One of the recipes to create ''oil of bane'' required [[alchemical]] vitriol of [[putrefied tumor]] extracted from the creatures killed by the darkness in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] of [[Western Heartlands]]. The vitriol then needed to be combined with a certain type of an alchemical sublimate."
