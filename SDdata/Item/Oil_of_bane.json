        "mainbody": "Oil of bane was a type of magic oil that temporarily rendered the target of its application unlucky and clumsy.\nThe substances sweet scent left a feeling of foolishness, ill-preparedness, and unworthy in those who inhaled it.\nOil of bane was used to coat weapons as those who received a successful strike from such weapons fell under the effects similar to that of the bane spell. Similar effects could be achieved by throwing an oil of bane vial at an opponent.\nOne of the recipes to create oil of bane required alchemical vitriol of putrefied tumor extracted from the creatures killed by the darkness in the Shadow-cursed Lands of Western Heartlands. The vitriol then needed to be combined with a certain type of an alchemical sublimate."
