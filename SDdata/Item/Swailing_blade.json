        "mainbody": "The swailing blade was a magical flaming scimitar found in Thorngap during the mid-1480s DR.\nThe long, curved scimitar visibly glowed with heat, exuding small flames.\nThe swailing blade burned and incinerated those it struck with varying degrees of ferocity. It also passively improved the firepower of magical flames produced by the wielder.\nThe blade was recovered from the stash of the druid Halsaime after he was defeated within the Druids Deep of Thorngap."
