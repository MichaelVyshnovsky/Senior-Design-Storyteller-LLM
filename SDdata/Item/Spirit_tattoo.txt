Spirit tattoos were a type of magic tattoos created by the Nubari people of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.
These permanent tattoos held magics that improved the recipients charisma, making them aesthetically pleasing to the eye. However, spirit tattoos came at the price of painful application. The process slightly but permanently negatively affected the recipients physique and ability to withstand damage.
In the late 14 century DR, the Year of Great Change of the Malatran calendar, a group of heroes from the Living Jungle were tasked by Bengoukee of the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba, on behalf of nature spirits, was sent to a faraway land of Faer√ªn to retrieve an artifact from a dreaded headshrinker. As a reward, Bengoukee applied a spirit tattoo on one of the heroes skin.
