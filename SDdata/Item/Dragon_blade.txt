The '''dragon blade''' was a [[magic]]al [[greatsword]] from [[Rashemen]] whose origins and creation were associated with [[silver dragon]]s. It possessed a powerful enchantment and was particularly deadly in the hands of those individuals who entered into frenzies or rages while in combat.

==Description==
The hilt of the sword resembled the head of a [[silver dragon]], inset with two [[sapphire]]s in place of its eyes.

==Powers==
The ''dragon blade'' was a ''+3 greatsword'' that chilled and slowed any foe it struck. It was exceptionally lethal when wielded by [[berserker]]s and [[barbarian]]s, particularly those of [[Rashemi]] heritage.

==History==
The tale of the ''dragon blade'' states it was originally gifted to a Rashemi warrior after they fought in a battle along side an actual silver dragon. Although the details were lost to the ages, it was said he fought with great bravery and valor.

By the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the blade came into the possession of the warrior [[Rigah]] and accompanied him on his [[dejemma]] to the [[Sword Coast]].
