        "mainbody": "'''''Mastering of Amahl V''''' was the name given to a ''[[shoonring]]'' that was part of the treasure hoard of the [[Blue dragon|great blue]] [[Dragon aging|wyrm]] [[Iryklathagra]]. It may have been one of the ''[[Qysari Rings]]'' made for members of the [[Shoon Dynasty]].<ref group=\"note\">The sourcebook ''[[Dragons of Faer√ªn]]'' states on page 20 that the ''mastering of Amahl V'' was part of her treasure hoard. It is unknown if the authors meant to say Amahl IV or if this is indeed another of the ''Qysari Rings''.",
        "Description": "The name came from [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qysara]] [[Shaani]] who offered the ring and many other treasures from the vaults of the [[Shoon Imperium]] to Iryklathagra in order to placate the [[dragon]].",
        "Powers": "This ring was reportedly a ''ring of efreeti calling'' which summoned an [[efreet]] just as a ''[[ring of djinni calling]]'' summoned a [[djinn]].The source states only that it was a ''ring of efreeti calling'', analogous to a ''[[ring of djinni calling]]'' If other powers were to be discovered, then this ring would certainly live up to the title of ''Qysari Ring''.",
        "History": "This ring was attributed to [[Amahl Shoon V]] This ring was given to the blue wyrm Iryklathagra as part of a bargain made between the dragon and the scions of the Shoon Dynasty."
