Wands of summoning were magic wands that allowed for a temporary summoning of creatures under the wielders control.
These wands allowed the user to cast the summon creature IV spell, materializing several creatures under the casters control. The effects of the wands spell were temporary. A typical wand of summoning possessed five charges.
Historically, the first versions of these wands were first created by worshipers of long-forgotten beast totems. Even though these wands origins were in divine magic, the 14 century versions were created to wield arcane magics, and even the incantations used for creation differed greatly.
