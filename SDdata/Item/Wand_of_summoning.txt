'''''Wands of summoning''''' were magic [[wand]]s that allowed for a temporary summoning of creatures under the wielder's control.

==Powers==
These wands allowed the user to cast the ''[[summon creature IV]]'' spell, materializing several creatures under the caster's control. The effects of the wand's spell were temporary. A typical ''wand of summoning'' possessed five charges.

==History==
Historically, the first versions of these wands were first created by worshipers of long-forgotten beast totems. Even though these wands' origins were in divine magic, the 14{{th}} century versions were created to wield arcane magics, and even the incantations used for creation differed greatly.
