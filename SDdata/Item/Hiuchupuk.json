        "mainbody": "hiuchupuk was a type of sled used on the Great Glacier.\nA hiuchupuk served as a water sled that incorporated the design of a kupuk sled with the addition of inflated seal skins affixed to its runners. This unique adaptation allowed the hiuchupuk to glide smoothly over water surfaces. However, the seal skins on the hiuchupuk had a limited lifespan due to the wear and tear caused by collisions with pack ice. When the seal skins become battered and deflated, they were fed to the kupuk."
