        "mainbody": "A '''hiuchupuk''' was a type of sled used on the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "A hiuchupuk served as a water sled that incorporated the design of a [[kupuk sled]] with the addition of inflated [[seal]] skins affixed to its runners. This unique adaptation allowed the hiuchupuk to glide smoothly over water surfaces. However, the seal skins on the hiuchupuk had a limited lifespan due to the wear and tear caused by collisions with pack ice. When the seal skins become battered and deflated, they were fed to the [[kupuk]]."
