'''''Hellsteel''''' was a [[magic]]al [[full plate]] [[armor]].

==Description==
A ''Hellsteel'' was a dark full-plate armor run with red veins that looked like marble. It was crafted from [[remorhaz]] scales in the fires of [[Baator]], but the latter was not strictly necessary to craft a ''Hellsteel''.

==Powers==
A ''Hellsteel'' was a ''+3 full plate'' armor. Its magic gave the wearer protection against heat and, on [[command word|command]], enshrouded him or her with an effect equivalent to a warm ''[[fire shield]]'',

The armor's other property was to hurt people who touched it for at least six seconds, with the wearer being the sole exception. This could happen when the wearer was wrestled down or when the wearer wrestled down somebody.

Crafting a replica of ''Hellsteel'' required the casting of ''fire shield'' and ''[[resist elements]]'' by a person who was trained in the creation of magical arms and armors.

==History==
The original ''Hellsteel'' was crafted by [[Nirzayal]], an [[abishai]] armorsmith, somewhere in Baator. Replicas of it with basically the same properties were later produced, which were not always created in the Nine Hells.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Cordelia Flametongue]], a powerful [[vengeance knight]]
