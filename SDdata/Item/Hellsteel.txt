Hellsteel was a magical full plate armor.
A Hellsteel was a dark full-plate armor run with red veins that looked like marble. It was crafted from remorhaz scales in the fires of Baator, but the latter was not strictly necessary to craft a Hellsteel.
A Hellsteel was a +3 full plate armor. Its magic gave the wearer protection against heat and, on command, enshrouded him or her with an effect equivalent to a warm fire shield,
The armors other property was to hurt people who touched it for at least six seconds, with the wearer being the sole exception. This could happen when the wearer was wrestled down or when the wearer wrestled down somebody.
Crafting a replica of Hellsteel required the casting of fire shield and resist elements by a person who was trained in the creation of magical arms and armors.
The original Hellsteel was crafted by Nirzayal, an abishai armorsmith, somewhere in Baator. Replicas of it with basically the same properties were later produced, which were not always created in the Nine Hells.
