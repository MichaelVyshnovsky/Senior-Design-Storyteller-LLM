{{Quote|''We who were born under the Dragon firmly believe that for all its faults and disputes, Cormyr is the greatest realm in all Faerûn. We are proud to dwell in this green and blessed land of valiant Purple Dragons, and we would have no other.''|Elender Stormfall, ''The Dream of the Dragon''}}
'''''The Dream of the Dragon''''' was a [[chapbook]] written by the [[bard]] [[Elender Stormfall]] of [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was published late in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].

In the book, Elender discussed the spirit, doubts, and moods of the people of Cormyr around the time of the death of King [[Azoun IV]] and the rise of the Regent [[Alusair]] in [[1371 DR]], and of the years after once her rule was in place.
