        "mainbody": "'''Ondal's wines''' were white or golden [[wine]]s made by the [[mage]] and vintner [[Ondal]] prior to the [[spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], when Ondal's manor and most of his wine cellar was destroyed.  A few wagonloads of wine escaped destruction and these were soon recovered and dispersed throughout the [[Realms]].{{Cite dungeon/179/Eye on the Realms: Ondal's Stand}}  \n\nThe wine was noteworthy in that the Spellplague infused [[wild magic]] into the bottles and, whenever a bottle was opened, uncontrolled destructive [[magic]] was released. Numerous groups attempted to find the remaining bottles and either destroy them or use them for nefarious purposes."
