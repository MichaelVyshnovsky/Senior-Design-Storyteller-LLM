The Overmantle of Halgondas was a device that affected Cormathan mantles.
Per Ilimitar, the Overmantle allowed the user to merge their mantle with that of their target, preventing it from warding off spells and making it impossible to separate the targets. It activated upon breakage.
The Overmantle remained in the Vault of Ages until , when Ilimitar used it in a duel with the Srinshee.
