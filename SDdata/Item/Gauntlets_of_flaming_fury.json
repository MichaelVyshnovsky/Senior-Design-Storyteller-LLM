        "mainbody": "Gauntlets of flaming fury were magical gauntlets that imbued their wearers weapons with magic and fire.\nThe gauntlets were made from steel.\nWhen worn, the gauntlets temporarily transformed any mundane weapon into a magical one. The gauntlets also allowed the wearer to surround a melee weapon with magical flames. This flame lasted as long as the wearer held the weapon or until it was sheathed. The magical abilities of the gauntlets could only be used once every 24 hours.\nThe minotaur Torogar Steelfist, who served in Avernus as Arkhans bodyguard, wore a pair of gauntlets of flaming fury."
