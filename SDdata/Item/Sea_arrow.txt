'''Sea arrows''' were [[arrow]]s that were designed for underwater use by [[aquatic elves]].

==Description==
Sea arrows were made by sea elves, specially made to exceptionally high quality. When used with an [[aquatic longbow]] the arrows flew (or swam) forth over a long distance without slowing down or losing accuracy as most other missile weapons did, giving the user a great advantage over their target.
