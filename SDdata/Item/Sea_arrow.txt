Sea arrows were arrows that were designed for underwater use by aquatic elves.
Sea arrows were made by sea elves, specially made to exceptionally high quality. When used with an aquatic longbow the arrows flew (or swam) forth over a long distance without slowing down or losing accuracy as most other missile weapons did, giving the user a great advantage over their target.
