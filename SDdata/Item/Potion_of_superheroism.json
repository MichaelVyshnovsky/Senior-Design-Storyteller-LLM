        "mainbody": "A potion of superheroism was a stronger version of the potion of heroism.\nWhen ingested, the potion granted an increase in life energy akin to the potion of heroism, boosting the combat prowess of anyone who had yet to reach legendary levels of fighting skill.\nThese potions could be used as the material component for the Tensers transformation spell.\nOne was kept in the Devouring Chambers, within Thaymounts Citadel.\nLapis lazuli was an adequate base for such a potion. They may also have been made with a lock of a great heros hair, or by priests with access to the charm sphere.\n*Valandrin Telenna\n*Viledel\n*Ter-Soth\n*Dalvar Corzon\n*Blazidon\n*A paste-version, made for underwater users, was found in the treasure of the kraken Qolintaroq around the year .\n* A goblet of glory could dispense a liquid that had a similar effect."
