'''''Wrath of Righteousness''''' was a large [[heavy mace]] that was the [[weapon]] wielded by the avatar of [[Berronar Truesilver]], the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deity]] of traditional home life and safety.<ref name=frcs-3e-p238">

==Description==
This huge [[mace]] was made of [[steel]] and was inscribed with [[gold]].

==Powers==
The ''+4'' weapon was the bane of [[evil]] [[thieves]] and those involved in killing. Even if the mace just made contact with such a target, it would slay them outright, should they not be able to resist. Should the target have resisted the hit, ''Wrath of Righteousness'' would not be able to instantly kill the same being again.
