        "mainbody": "he Scroll of Retribution was a divine document that had names of certain incredibly evil mortals inscribed upon it.\nThe scroll, which was kept in the Pavilion of Righteous Justice (also called the Pavilion of Righteous Wrath or Pavilion of Righteousness) in Lunia. It listed only the most truly evil and powerful beings. The deities themselves, particularly Tyr, would decide the names that appeared on the document. These names glowed brightly from the parchment. Once chosen, the goodly followers of such deities, such as planetars and crusaders of Torm, visited such mortals to mete out justice.\nA solitary holy scribe, the Scribe of Righteous Wrath, was assigned to mark the names down with a quill, as well as with special ink and sand (which absorbed and erased the ink). Nobody else, bar petitioners, were permitted to use these materials. Circa 1369 DR, the scribe was a proficient mage named Naiman Alore.\nThe Scroll of Divine Retribution emanated great power in waves, a palpable energy that filled the air. It was protected by priests and paladins of Tyr."
