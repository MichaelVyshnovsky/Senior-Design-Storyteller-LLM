        "mainbody": "The '''Scroll of Retribution''' was a [[divine]] document that had names of certain incredibly [[evil]] mortals inscribed upon it.",
        "Description": "The scroll, which was kept in the Pavilion of Righteous Justice (also called the Pavilion of Righteous Wrath or Pavilion of Righteousness) in [[Lunia]]. It listed only the most truly evil and powerful beings. The deities themselves, particularly [[Tyr]], would decide the names that appeared on the document. These names glowed brightly from the parchment. Once chosen, the [[good]]ly followers of such deities, such as [[planetar]]s and [[crusader]]s of Torm, visited such mortals to mete out justice.\n\nA solitary holy scribe, the Scribe of Righteous Wrath, was assigned to mark the names down with a quill, as well as with special [[ink]] and [[sand]] (which absorbed and erased the ink). Nobody else, bar [[petitioner (Lunia)|petitioner]]s, were permitted to use these materials. Circa [[1369 DR]], the scribe was a proficient [[mage]] named [[Naiman Alore]].\n\nThe Scroll of Divine Retribution emanated great power in waves, a palpable energy that filled the air. It was protected by [[priest]]s and [[paladin]]s of Tyr."
