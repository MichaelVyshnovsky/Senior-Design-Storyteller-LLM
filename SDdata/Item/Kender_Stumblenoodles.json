        "Description": "Traditional Kender Stumblenoodles were prepared by following several simple steps. First, the cook browned minced [[cow]]'s meat with diced [[onion]]s and [[pepper]]s. Then, [[tomato]] sauce, chopped tomatoes, and water were added to the browning pan to simmer. [[Noodle]]s were cooked separately and later mixed into the meat and vegetable sauce.\n\nAnother version of [[cheese]]-drenched Stumblenoodles was also known to have existed. A [[pot]]-full concoction of [[flour]], [[paprika]], [[garlic powder]], and [[red pepper]] were mixed with [[butter]] and, later, whisked with [[milk]]. Once thickened, the cook was to add [[mustard]] and cheeses. Then the cheese sauce was mixed with cooked noodles and baked in a greased baking dish, and topped with [[bread]] crumbs.",
        "History": "Historically, Kender Stumblenoodles was a more complex dish. According to the legend of its creation, kenders once needed to come up with a hearty meal for a horde of people, and they combined two popular kender dishes: Saucy Beef and Vegetable Stuff and Noodles that Look Just Like Aunt Helmley's Elbow, but Without The Warts. With time, kenders perfected the dish and claimed that Stumblenoodles always tasted better when mixed last-minute whilst entertaining a hoard of guests, to reenact the original legendary event that birthed the dish.\n\nAnother legend, born much later, talked about a different version of the dish and claimed that it was born on the waves of the Blood Sea of Istar, from a culinary battle of two kenders, when their pots mixed together in a hectic kerfuffle. Yet another legend came from kender adventurers who claimed that the other cheesy version of the dish was born from a [[draconian]] pursuit, in which a kender used the dish's ingredients and thrown weapons.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a cook named [[Kaga]] from the city of [[Daggerford]] came to prominence thanks to the cheesy version of Kender Stumblenoodles, which he so humbly renamed to '''Kaga's Stumblenoodles'''. The dish was especially popular among the children of Daggerford who did farm work for Kaga, for which he paid with Stumblenoodles imbued with minor magic."
