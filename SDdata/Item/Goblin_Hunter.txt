'''''Goblin Hunter''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] designed specifically for hunting [[goblin]]s of [[Icewind Dale]], created by [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]] of [[Targos]].

==Description==
''Goblin Hunter'' had a delicate [[pearl]] handle, and its blade looked more like a hunting knife than a weapon.

==Powers==
The blade's enchantments were especially dangerous to goblins as its edge cut deeper into the creatures' hides. Functionally, the dagger became a ''+2'' enchanted weapon when wielded against goblins.

==History==
''Goblin Hunter'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, by the [[enchantress]] Elytharra Dinnesmore, the wife of [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]], the speaker of Targos at the time. She created the magic blade as a way to defend herself from goblin raids that menaced the settlements of [[Icewind Dale]]. When asked about ''Goblin Hunter'', Elytharra claimed that the weapon was used only a handful of times. As of 1312 DR, the enchantress was willing to part with ''Goblin Hunter'' for the rite price.
