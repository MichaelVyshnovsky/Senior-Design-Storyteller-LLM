By some means, possibly left as an offering, the ''Amulet of the Devout'' ended up stored in the trapped and secured vault underneath the [[Stormshore Tabernacle]], a non-denominational shrine in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. If anyone was daring or foolish enough to rob the temple and steak Otto's amulet, they were castigated by the divinities of the [[Realms]], sending [[deva]]s and [[cambion]]s to end their lives."
