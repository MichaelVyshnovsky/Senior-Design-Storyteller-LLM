'''Wealdathar''' was a delicacy made by the elves of [[Suldanessellar]] in the [[Forest of Tethir]].

==Description==
Wealdathar was a flavorful mixture of ground forest roots, [[berries]], [[quail]] meat, and smoked flesh of Wealdath beasts. This delicious paste was used as a spread and was very nutritional. Many spread Wealdathar across slices of [[bread]] or [[biscuit]]s, sprinkled with [[salt]] and [[pepper]].

==Rumors and Legends==
[[Volothamp Geddarm]] suspected that in addition to the ingredients listed above, Wealdathar also included such things as [[snake]] meat, bog-[[frog]]s, and [[rotfungus]]. There were also rumors that Wealdathar contained a secret magical ingredient created by the elves, and it allowed them to control anyone who even imbibed the delicacy.
