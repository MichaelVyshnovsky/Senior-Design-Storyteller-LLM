Wealdathar was a delicacy made by the elves of Suldanessellar in the Forest of Tethir.
Wealdathar was a flavorful mixture of ground forest roots, berries, quail meat, and smoked flesh of Wealdath beasts. This delicious paste was used as a spread and was very nutritional. Many spread Wealdathar across slices of bread or biscuits, sprinkled with salt and pepper.
Volothamp Geddarm suspected that in addition to the ingredients listed above, Wealdathar also included such things as snake meat, bog-frogs, and rotfungus. There were also rumors that Wealdathar contained a secret magical ingredient created by the elves, and it allowed them to control anyone who even imbibed the delicacy.
