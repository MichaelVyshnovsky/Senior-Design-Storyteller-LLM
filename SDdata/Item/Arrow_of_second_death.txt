Arrows of second death were powerful enchanted arrows created to grant eternal peace to the undead.
Arrows of second death were adorned with mystical runes that granted their undead-slaying powers.
When used against undead targets, these arrows became very accurate and even more damaging.
Arrows of second death were quite rare. In 1369 DR, some of these arrows were in possession of orogs and dark nagas residing in the Lower Keep level of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor of Myth Drannor.
