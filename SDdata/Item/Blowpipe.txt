'''Blowpipes''', otherwise known as '''blowguns''', were a type of exotic ranged weapon.

==Description==
Blowpipes were long hollow tubes, ranging from {{SIrange|4|7|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Usage==
Some tribes were known to use stands to brace their blowpipes, in order to prevent swaying.<ref>[[Gary Gygax]] (August 1982). “New Weapons from Another Great Mind”. In [[Kim Mohan]] ed. ''[[Dragon magazine 64|Dragon #64]]'' (TSR, Inc.), p. 6.

Beyond their purpose as a weapon, some were known to use blowpipes as breathing tubes for swimming underwater.

==Ammunition==
A wide variety of ammunition were known to be used in blowpipes. This included blowgun [[Dart|darts]], needles, and little pellets of hardened clay. Darts were the most commonly used form of ammunition, while needles were used to deliver [[poison]] and pellets were used in hunting small game.

Blowgun darts were small arrows, with cotton or some other form of plant fiber used as fletching. This fletching made an efficient seal in the pipe, allowing for a greater build up of pressure from the wielder's breath.

Blowgun needles were typically {{SI|2|in|long=yes}} in length and made of [[iron]]. They were known to be sold in groups of twenty in small wooden cases. Poisons typically used with these needles included [[greenblood oil]], [[bloodroot]], [[blue whinnis]], [[shadow essence]], and [[deathblade]].
