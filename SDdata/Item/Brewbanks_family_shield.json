        "mainbody": "Brewbanks family shield was a unique enchanted shield wielded by Wilfred Brewbanks in the late 15 century DR.\nThe shield was enchanted with simple +1 defensive magics and each strike blocked by it returned a small potion of damage dealt back at the attacker. Brewbanks family shield was a small round metal shield decorated with an image of the sun and colored in silver and blue.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Brewbanks family shield had been passed down through generations of the Brewbanks family. However, Wilfred Brewbanks, the shields last owner, did not hold the heirloom in much regard, ready to sell it an interested party during his trip along the Trade Way to the city of Luskan with Tollins caravan."
