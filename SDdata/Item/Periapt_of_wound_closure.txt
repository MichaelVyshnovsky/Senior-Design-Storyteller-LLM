A '''''periapt of wound closure''''' was a magical [[amulet]].

==Description==
The periapt was a brilliant red stone set in gold hands and hung from a chain of gold.

==Powers==
The periapt was used to not only heal serious wounds but also prevent them. It provided double the usual rate of a ''[[periapt of health]]''. When the amulet was given to a wounded individual, their condition stabilized and bleeding ceased.
