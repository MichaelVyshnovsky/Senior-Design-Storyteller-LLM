Dog pepper was a diversionary tool used by thieves to distract dogs, similar to aniseed though comparatively less effective.
Dog pepper came in small packets, holding enough to cover a  cube. When dropped on the ground behind them, a fleeing thief could potentially cover-up their scent, though they had better results when throwing dog pepper up into the air. Alternatively, a thief could throw dog pepper directly into the face of a hound to drive them hysterical for an hour.
