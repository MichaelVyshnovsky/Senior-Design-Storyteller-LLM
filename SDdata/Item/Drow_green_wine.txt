'''Drow green wine''', sometimes simply called '''green wine''', was a type of an alcoholic beverage fermented with vegetation and [[fungus]] of the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
A typical drow green wine recipe consisted of [[orbloren]], a type of subterranean mushroom, distilled in water and juice of [[marrult]], another species of Underdark fungi. Orbloren mushrooms were boiled in water with added crushed marrult. It was impossible to distill orbloren without the use of marrult as it produced the the richest and most valuable drow green wine. The more marrult was added the more flavor the final product had.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803164924/http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed (Apr-Jun 2006) | accessdate = 03-08-2021| date = 03-08-2021}}

The distilled liquid was captured via a cool metallic hood or a bowl hung about the boiling mushroom liquid. The condensation was collected into vessels, and chilled in cold underground streams for around forty days. If immature green wine was consumed, it left unpleasant burning sensation in the imbiber's throat and tongue. Sometimes a few crystals of [[salt]] were used to clarify drow green wine if it came out murky. This alcoholic drink could be kept for years after distillation. If the wine was boiled, it quickly turned oily black and became unpalatably burnt tasting.

Contrary to many beliefs, drow green wine was not concocted using [[spider]] [[poison|venom]].

==Availability==
Ulaver wine was the notable type of drow green wine, produced by the [[House Ulaver]] of [[Menzoberranzan]]. Their drink was a sparkling [[Spices|spiced]] luminous green wine.

Spiced green wine was a popular variation among the surface as well and subterranean drow. The drink was sometimes served fizzing and customarily served for noble gatherings as an aperitif while guests mingled and schemed. Spiced sparkling green wine was a popular libation in [[Narbondellyn]] where it was commonly served in cafes and taverns.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], drow green wine gained some popularity in the surface world and could often be found across the further northern parts of [[High Road]] and [[Luskan]].
