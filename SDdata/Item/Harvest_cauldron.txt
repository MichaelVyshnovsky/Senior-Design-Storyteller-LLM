The harvest cauldron was an enchanted cauldron or cooking pot that could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
The harvest cauldron could be used to create the effect of the heroes feast spell.
Sometime during the late 15 century, the harvest cauldron came into the possession of Pikel Bouldershoulder, who was in the habit of using pots as helmets in battle. He was said to consider the preparation of a hearty meal for his friends to be one of his most important rituals.
