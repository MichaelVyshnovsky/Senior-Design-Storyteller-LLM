A stormcatcher band, also known as a stormcatcher ring, was a magical ring that could absorb incoming electrical magic and reflect it back to its caster.
These rings were made of copper and had a setting for the place of a gem. Such prized rings were usually stored in small boxes, and well hidden.
Stormcatcher bands reflected magic from magical weapons, such as Kozahs Needle.
In 1463 DR, the succubus Arunika gifted the Thayan sorceress Sylora Salm such a ring. Salm aimed to use it to enhance her Ashmadai champion, Jestry Rallevin, and kill her archnemisis, Dahlia Sinfelle.
