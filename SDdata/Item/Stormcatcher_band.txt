A '''''stormcatcher band''''', also known as a '''''stormcatcher ring''''', was a [[magic]]al [[ring]] that could absorb incoming electrical [[magic]] and reflect it back to its caster.

==Description==
These rings were made of [[copper]] and had a setting for the place of a [[gem]]. Such prized rings were usually stored in small boxes, and well hidden.

==Powers==
''Stormcatcher bands'' reflected magic from magical [[weapon]]s, such as [[Kozah's Needle]].

==History==
In [[1463 DR]], the [[succubus]] Arunika gifted the [[Thayan]] [[sorceress]] Sylora Salm such a ring. Salm aimed to use it to enhance her [[Ashmadai]] champion, [[Jestry Rallevin]], and kill her archnemisis, [[Dahlia Sin'felle]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Arunika]], who kept such a ring in a ''[[bag of holding]]''.
* [[Sylora Salm]]
