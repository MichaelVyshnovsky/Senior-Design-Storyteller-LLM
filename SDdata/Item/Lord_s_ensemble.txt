A '''''lord's ensemble''''' was a [[magic]]al garment worn by the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lords of Waterdeep]] when meeting with each other. The full set conferred multiple identity-concealing benefits to its wearer.

==Description==
All ''lord's ensembles'' were identical sets consisting of a [[helm]], an [[amulet]], and a [[robe]]. They functioned together as a single magic item.

==Powers==
Each part of the ''ensemble'' conferred a different set of effects to hide the identity of its wearer:
* ''[[Lords' helm]]'' covered the entire head and face of its wearer, including a screen to cover the eyes without hampering vision. The helm magically altered the wearer's voice to a genderless timbre. Additionally, it protected the wearer from magical mind-reading effects, similarly to the protection provided by a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]''.
* ''[[Lords' amulet]]'', which bore the crest of [[Waterdeep]], hid the wearer from [[divination]] magic, including ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' sensors. Its effect was similar to that of an ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]''.
* ''[[Lords' robe]]'' created the [[illusion]] of the wearer having an androgynous humanoid build about 6 ft (1.8 m) tall. It also conferred immunity to its wearer from being magically restrained or paralyzed, in an effect similar to that of a ''[[ring of free action]]''.

All these powers only worked within the limits of the city of Waterdeep and [[Waterdeep/Sewers|its sewers]].
