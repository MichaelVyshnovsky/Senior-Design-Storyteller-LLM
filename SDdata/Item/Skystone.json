        "Description": "This colorless transparent rock could be tinted to match any hue. It was as hard as [[marble]] and could be chiseled or carved just like ordiary stone.",
        "History": "The [[dwarves]] of [[Siremun]], a kingdom on the Firepeaks, actively mined this mineral and used it in the construction of some sections of their home. They would go on to export large amounts of skystone to wealthy princes and [[wizard]]s, who used it to construct palaces and towers. \n\nSiremun profited greatly from selling skystone to both [[Semphar]] and [[Yaimmunahar]], both of whom desired it for constructing glittering buildings. The Caliph of Semphar had used skystone for the construction of many towers in [[Dhaztanar]]."
