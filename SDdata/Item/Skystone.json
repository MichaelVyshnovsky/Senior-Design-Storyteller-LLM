        "mainbody": "kystone was a rare crystal mineral found only in the Firepeaks of the Hordelands.\nThis colorless transparent rock could be tinted to match any hue. It was as hard as marble and could be chiseled or carved just like ordiary stone.\nThe dwarves of Siremun, a kingdom on the Firepeaks, actively mined this mineral and used it in the construction of some sections of their home. They would go on to export large amounts of skystone to wealthy princes and wizards, who used it to construct palaces and towers. \nSiremun profited greatly from selling skystone to both Semphar and Yaimmunahar, both of whom desired it for constructing glittering buildings. The Caliph of Semphar had used skystone for the construction of many towers in Dhaztanar."
