        "mainbody": "'''''Starfire''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[star metal]] [[short sword]] created by an unnamed evil [[derro]] and brought nothing but bad luck to all of its owners.",
        "Powers": "This short sword possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and scorched its targets with magical fire. Additionally, each landed hit flashed with the ''[[flare]]'' spell.",
        "History": "''Starfire'' originated from the depths of the [[Underdark]] where it was forged by an unknown evil derro from a meteorite chunk. Over the years, the weapon drifted from one unlucky owner to the next. After the derro, ''Starfire'' was claimed by a group of marauding [[mountain dwarves]] who were discovered and killed by a band of [[troglodyte]]s thanks to the sword's magical flashing glow. The next owner was an industrious [[halfling]] who stole ''Starfire'' from the troglodyte war band and took it to the surface world, only to lose the short sword to robbers.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], yet another owner of ''Starfire'' met their demise. The sword was found in the lair of a vicious beast, the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]] in the [[Lonely Warrens]] after its owner was ripped apart by a swarm of vicious rats and brain eater by MRCD itself."
