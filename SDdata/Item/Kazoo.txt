'''Kazoos''' were [[musical instruments]] that greatly entertained the players; however, those who listened often took a dimmer view.

==Description==
Similar to mundane kazoos, there were [[enchanted]] variations that offered even more danger to those exposed to the music. Commonly found in the [[Nelanther Isles]] and other locations on the [[Sea of Swords]], enchanted kazoos were created to be used by some especially cruel [[bard]]s to produce devastating sonic effects similar to that of the ''[[sound burst]]'' spell.

==Reputation==
Apart from some bards, [[minstrel]]s were known to utilize a wide variety of musical wind instruments. Most were referred to as "pipes" even though in reality they could be several types of instruments, including kazoos.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/save/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_080910-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Augâ€“Oct 2004 | accessdate = 12-03-2022| date = 25-11-2021}}

==History==
Kazoos were considered a humorous musical instrument by most even though its invention dated back to distant days of forgotten antiquity.

Magical kazoos were in common use in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Notably, Captain [[Allendry]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' outfitted his crew with them and offered them for sale.
