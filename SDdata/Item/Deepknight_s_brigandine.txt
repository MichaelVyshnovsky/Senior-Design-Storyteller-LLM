'''''Deepknight's brigandine''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[heavy armor]] found in [[Gauntlgrym]] and in areas of the [[Underdark]].

==Powers==
''Deepknight's brigandine'' possessed increased defensive qualities, enchanted specifically for those who ventured into the deadly darkness of the Underdark. These types of armor were dyed to blend in with the pitch blackness of the underground caves. Despite being a heavy type of armor, it was crafted light enough to help the wearer dodge attacks of the Underdark's hungry denizens.

==History==
These [[brigandine]]s were worn by dwarven forces and adventurers who came to [[Bruenor Battlehammer]]'s aid in [[Gauntlgrym]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The underground city was besieged by [[Orcus]]'s [[demon]]s and [[alhoon]]s attempting to claim Gauntlgrym. Bruenor himself was unable to defend his throne as he was sworn to aid [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] against [[Demogorgon]], ravaging the Underdark.
