        "mainbody": "'''Tamarind balls''' were delicious little morsels sold at the [[Drover's Last Drink]] tavern in [[Mosstone]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''Delightful!''|[[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s review}}",
        "Description": "Tamarind balls were small handpie-sized pastries, richly spiced with [[tamarind]] and rolled into balls. These balls were cooked to soft, chewy perfection and dusted with [[sugar]]. The pastry's sweetness was pleasantly cut with tamarind's spiciness.",
        "History": "With the merchants and travelers on the [[Trade Way]], the culinary influence of [[Calimshan]] and [[Tashalar]] spread to some locations in neighboring [[Tethyr]], notably the [[Mosstone]] caravan stop village on the shore of [[Firedrake Bay]]. Tamarind was likely introduced to the proprietors of Drover's Last Drink through trade and culinary cross-pollination. Eventually, this led to the creation of the tamarind balls that were quite exotic in taste and impressed [[Volothamp Geddarm]] greatly during his research for one of his many guides in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR."
