'''''Mintassan's miraculous bracers''''' were [[enchanted]] [[bracers]] created by [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent, a planeswalker from the city of [[Westgate]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Despite appearing quite ordinary at first sight, ''Mintassan's miraculous bracers'' possessed [[magic]]s that enveloped the wearer in an invisible protective barrier, similar to a ''+3'' enchantment. Additionally, the bracers gave their wearer a small boost of vitality.

==History==
These wrist guards were created by Mintassan the Magnificent sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, who was quite proud of that particular creation. In the late 14{{Th}} century DR, the bracers were available for purchase from [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] in Westgate's [[Market Triangle]].
