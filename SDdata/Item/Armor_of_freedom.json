        "mainbody": "Armor of freedom was a set of enchanted heavy armor that allowed the wearer to move freely when restrained by magical means.\nArmor of freedom possessed a +3 enchantment. Additionally, the armors wearer was under the effects of the freedom spell.\nThe first armor of freedom was developed by a warrior-priest Archiel after he survived magical imprisonment. Archiel made a vow to himself never to be restrained by spells. He spent years forging armors of freedom for his own use and his companions. Ironically enough, Archiels life ended being imprisoned with no magics holding him there, apart from ordinary iron chains.\nThese armors became more common in the late 14 century DR, found in several cities across the Sword Coast, Neverwinter, and the Moonsea region."
