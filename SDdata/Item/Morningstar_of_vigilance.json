Despite their unwieldiness, these weapons were enchanted to sharpen its wielders reaction time. They also possessed +2 and +3 enchantments that guided the weapons to the targets and made the damage more deadly. Each successful attack with these morning stars resulted in a discharge of harmful radiant magic.\nBy the late 15 century DR, morningstars of vigilances were wielded by some lucky individuals and evil villains on the Sword Coast North. One of these morning stars belonged to Dazuur, an undead commander wight who used the ruins of Illefarn as its lair, another was in the possessions of Thayan agents in the Neverwinter Wood, one was wielded by cultists of an eye of flame in Neverwinter, and lastly, another morningstars of vigilance could be found in a horde of an adult white dragon who menaced the plains between the old Phandalin mines and Conyberry."
