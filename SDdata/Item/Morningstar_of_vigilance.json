        "mainbody": "'''''Morningstars of vigilance''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons, used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] across [[northwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Powers": "These morning stars were massive weapons that had to be wielded in both hands, as opposed to their more mundane and smaller kin. Despite their unwieldiness, these weapons were enchanted to sharpen its wielder's reaction time. They also possessed ''+2'' and ''+3'' enchantments that guided the weapons to the targets and made the damage more deadly. Each successful attack with these morning stars resulted in a discharge of harmful [[radiant]] magic.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''morningstars of vigilances'' were wielded by some lucky individuals and evil villains on the [[Sword Coast North]]. One of these morning stars belonged to [[Dazuur]], an [[undead]] commander [[wight]] who used the ruins of [[Illefarn]] as its lair, another was in the possessions of [[Thayan]] agents in the [[Neverwinter Wood]], one was wielded by cultists of an [[eye of flame]] in [[Neverwinter]], and lastly, another ''morningstars of vigilance'' could be found in a horde of an adult [[white dragon]] who menaced the plains between the old [[Phandalin]] mines and [[Conyberry]]."
