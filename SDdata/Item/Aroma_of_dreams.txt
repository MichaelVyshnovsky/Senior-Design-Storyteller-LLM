'''''Aroma of dreams''''' was a type of [[magic item|magical]], aromatic [[oil]] with a sleeping effect.

==Powers==
When a dose of this oil was worn, any creature that came within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} of the wearer would fall into a magical slumbere for 5 to 8 minutes.

The magical effect of an application of this aroma remained potent for around three to twelve minutes, after which time it would evaporate from the wearer.

==Availability==
* The [[Dancing Maiden]] in [[Westgate]], run by the [[mage]] [[Chalaratha]], was said to create ''aroma of dreams'' upon request for a hefty commission.
