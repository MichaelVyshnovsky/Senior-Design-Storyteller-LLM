The Hellriders Pride was a set of gauntlets associated with the Hellriders, the famed cavalry that defended Elturel, the holy city of Elturgard.
The distinct scent of brimstone emanated from the gauntlets.
The wearer of these gauntlets gained increased might and physical strength. Whenever the wearer healed someone else, that individual gained some inherent protection against any form of physical weaponry.
