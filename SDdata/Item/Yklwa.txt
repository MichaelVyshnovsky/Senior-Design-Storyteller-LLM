An yklwa () was a Chultan short spear.
A typical yklwa was four feet long, with about 40% of the length taken up by its sword-like, bladed point. It was primarily used as a thrusting spear in melee combat and was not well-balanced for throwing. It dealt more damage than a normal short spear but could only be thrown accurately with half a short spears range. Yklwas could be wielded with two hands, but Tabaxi warriors typically used them in conjunction with oval hide shields called hlang.
The name "yklwa" supposedly mimicked the sucking sound heard when pulling the weapon from the heart of a slain dinosaur.
In the late 15th century DR, the sale of yklwas in Port Nyanzaru was controlled by the merchant prince Ekene-Afa.
