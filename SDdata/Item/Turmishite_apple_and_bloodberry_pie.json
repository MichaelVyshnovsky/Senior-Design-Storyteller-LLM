        "mainbody": "'''Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie''' was a sweet baked dish from [[Turmish]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It was made from, of course, [[apple]] and [[bloodberry]]. It was similar to a [[cherry pie]], but much more tart.<ref group=\"note\">The bloodberry bush is found around the [[Battle of Bones]] and is extremely poisonous in every part. It's unknown if the bloodberries used in the pie are the same poisonous bloodberries used in minute amounts or a unique cooking method to eliminate or reduce the poison, are a different plant species entirely, or if only Battle of Bones bloodberries are poisonous. More likely, the bloodberries could be mistaken for [[Goblinberry bush|goblinberries]], which are similar, also found around the Battle of Bones, and can be consumed in a sweet dish.",
        "Reputation": "While few loved it, [[Vhonna Deepdell]] and Madame [[Garah]] of [[Waterdeep]] did and bonded over Turmishite apple and bloodberry pies around [[1368 DR]]."
