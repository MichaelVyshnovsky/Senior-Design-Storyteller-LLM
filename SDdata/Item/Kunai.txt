A '''kunai''' or '''tobi-kunai''' was a basic handheld utility tool that found use by [[ninja]] operatives in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The kunai was a broad, flat [[knife]] that somewhat resembled a [[trowel]]. Its blade widened out and then narrowed to a point, taking a spatulate shape.

==Usage==
The kunai was a versatile tool and could be used for digging earth, boring wood, and otherwise cutting, wedging, or prying anything that needed it.

Ninjas used the kunai as a general-purpose tool for their illicit work, as a single kunai filled many potential roles. They most notably used it to dig through the earth at surprisingly high speeds.
