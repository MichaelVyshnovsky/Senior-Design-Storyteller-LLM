Pale Justice was a holy avenger crafted with the sole purpose to destroy evil throughout the Realms.
Despite its powerful properties, Pale Justice was notably plain in appearance.
The sword was blessed by the god Tyr with a +4 enchantment. It struck more true and inflicted more grievous wounds against any malevolent beings it struck.
Whomever wielded it became immune to a number of spells that instilled fear and horror within others.
Pale Justice was originally forged as a non-magical blade by by a Tyrran smithy named Renold, some time during or before the midâ€“13 century DR. Renold humbly offered the non-magical sword to Edan, a devout acolyte in the church of Tyr. Edan and other priest of the local temple beseeched Tyr to bless the sword with divine power, but saw no change in its form or essence. All but one of the priests gave up on the effort, save for Edan, who continued his prayers for 30 years.
When a group of visiting priests of Helm mocked Edan for his futile prayers, the Tyrran priests lifted the blade from upon the altar. He stated that Tyrs work with the sword had been completed years ago. A guardsman of the Helmite priests drew his own, heavily-ornamented sword and ridiculed Pale Justice. Edan gently tapped the other sword with Pale Justice and saw that the overly-adorned blade break in the guardsmans hand.
Edan commissioned a simple, leather-wrapped wooden handle for the sword. He bestowed it upon a young paladin with the request he always bear in mind the profound graciousness humankind is capable of.
As of the , the sword remained in the possession of an unknown individual who died within the Artisans District of Dorns Deep.
