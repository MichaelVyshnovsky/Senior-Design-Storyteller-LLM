A '''''figurehead of attacks''''' was a type of ''[[figurehead of wondrous power]]'', a [[humanoid]] wooden figure placed on the front of a [[spelljammer]] that enhanced the piloting abilities of, and granted additional powers to, the [[mage]] at the [[spelljamming helm|ship's helm]].{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

==Description==
These types of figureheads were made from [[ash]] and embedded with [[ruby|rubies]] in its brow. Due to the unique magical powers of the figurehead, they were often placed on the deck of a spelljammer.

==Powers==
A ''figurehead of attacks'' granted the ship greater maneuverability, allowing its pilot to sense the ship from the perspective of the figure itself. Furthermore, it could be animated by the mage, as long as they maintained concentration. While controlling the figurehead, the mage could attack with the construct, as if they were controlling an animated warrior with fists of hardwood. Any break in the mage's concentration would cease the connection between the mage and the figurehead.
