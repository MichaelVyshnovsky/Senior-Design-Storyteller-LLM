The '''Whispering Children''' were twenty-two powerful [[artifact]]s in the form of portraits. In reality, they were the transformed [[demipower]] children of the [[deity|god]] [[Oghma]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|2381|14}} The paintings were referred to as Whispering Children because they whispered secrets to those nearby.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies||11}}

==History==
Shortly after ascending to godhood, Oghma fathered many demipower children.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|2363|14}} A few of his children decided to each specialize in an area of knowledge of their choosing. But twenty-two of the children were turned away from Oghma by [[Cyric]], who transformed them into paintings.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|2377|14}} The goddess [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] attempted to take the paintings from Cyric but he scattered the paintings across [[Faer√ªn]] and most were lost. Lord [[Kasdrian Norjah]] of the noble [[House Norjah]] of [[Airspur]] managed to collect seven of the Whispering Children by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The knowledge held by the Whispering Children was dangerous even to the gods, especially to Oghma.
