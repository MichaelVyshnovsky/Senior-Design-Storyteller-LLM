The '''''Iron Helm of Heroes''''' was an [[artifact]] and minor relic of [[Ilmater]] the Broken God and his [[Church of Ilmater|church]].

==Description==
The ''Iron Helm of Heroes'' was unremarkable in appearance. It was a simple, bowl-shaped headpiece fashioned from [[bronze]] and of ancient construction. There was no ornamentation bar the [[holy symbol]] of Ilmater over the forehead: two human hands crossed and bound at the wrist.

==Powers==
If worn by a being of [[good]] heart, the ''Iron Helm'' granted them the ability to cast [[divine]] [[spell]]s as a high-level [[cleric]] with access to the [[Healing sphere|Healing]] and [[Necromantic sphere]]s. However, these spells could only have a beneficial, curative effect, and could not harm or inflict suffering. Typical spells were ''[[aid]]'', ''[[breath of life]]'', ''[[cure blindness or deafness]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[cure critical wounds]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[fortify]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[raise dead]]'', ''[[regenerate]]'', ''[[reincarnate]]'', ''[[restoration]]'', ''[[resurrection]]'', and ''[[slow poison]]''. To gain access to these spells, the wearer simply had to meditate for a time and pray to Ilmater, as was standard for a normal cleric of the deity. However, those who could already cast divine spells could not prepare their normal spells while they wore the ''Helm''. If the ''Helm'' was removed, then all its spells were lost.

Once a set number of spells had been used, then the ''Helm'' disappeared and teleported to a random location in [[Faerûn]]. Here it would be found by another good-hearted being who could use it to heal heroes in need.

==History==

The true origins of the ''Helm'' were unknown. However, it was commonly believed to be the only remnant of an [[avatar]] of Ilmater that died somewhere south of the [[Inner Sea]] some time in the 4{{th}} century [[DR]].Specifically, this is "over a millennia" before the present time of around [[1369 DR]]. In fact, an ancient religious text from the island of [[Ixinos]] written in the 300s DR titled ''[[Divine Rapture of Ilmater]]'' told of the appearance of the Crying God and how he wrestled with "the cur of [[Gehenna]]", a corrupted minion of [[Bhaal]], Lord of Murder. Enduring all its clawing and biting, Ilmater carried the beast into the sea and there died with it. Only his iron helm was found on the beach later.

Many other legends and stories across Faerûn made mention of the ''Iron Helm of Heroes'' and its powers of healing. They told that the ''Helm'' halted countless plagues and healed numerous suffering heroes who fought the forces of darkness. However, it never stayed long in one place, and Ilmater often guided it such that it reappeared where it was needed—its discovery often heralded a vital need for its healing magic.

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Iron Helm'' was in the possession of Lord [[Tessaril Winter]] of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]]. Friendly to local adventurers, Tessaril often used it to aid those who explored the nearby [[Haunted Halls]]. However, Tessaril was unaware of its limited number of uses, and it was likely to disappear and reappear somewhere else when she reached that limit. Nevertheless, she rationed its uses out, only healing a group once or twice. She still had it as of [[1369 DR]].

==Destruction==
There were several theoretical ways to destroy the ''Iron Helm of Heroes'', if one should desire it. One was for it to be worn by a cleric or [[wizard]] as they were transformed into a [[lich]]. Another was to dip it in the blood of a Faerûnian ruler killed in a great battle that claimed 10,000 other souls. Involving the gods, an [[avatar]] of [[Talos]] could drink [[unholy water]] desecrated in the Destroyer's name from the ''Helm'', or [[Loviatar]], the Maiden of Pain and rival of Ilmater, could whip an Ilmatari wearing the ''Helm'' 10,000 times.
