Knight Vision Goggles were enchanted goggles that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.
This magical item took the form of goggles used for eye protection while working in workshops.
Using this item allowed the owner to look like a knight and nullify one attack. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.
In the late 15 century DR, such goggles could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such items were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon.
