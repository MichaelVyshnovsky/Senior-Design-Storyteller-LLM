A champions symbol was an enchanted holy symbol inscribed with stylized flames that allowed the wearer to impose their will over their foes.
The symbol granted its wearer the power to dominate the will of their enemies when they struck them with a mighty weapon strike, a fire-based spell, or a radiant spell.
As of the late 15 century DR, champions symbols were known to be possessed by followers of Bane in Vaasa and by the church of Torm, the church of Ilmater, and the Luminous Society in Impiltur.
Some said that the design of the champions symbol was inspired by a legendary priest of Bahamut who used holy fire to purge his church of corruption and evil infiltrators.
