'''''Ring of clumsiness''''' or '''''Jester's Folly''''' was a ''[[cursed]]'' [[ring]] that made the wearer excessively clumsy.

==Powers==
Like other ''cursed'' objects, ''rings of clumsiness'' could only be taken off via ''[[remove curse]]'' [[spell]], a powerful [[cleric]], or other similar means. Unless removed, these rings turned the wearer into an unlucky klutz, making dextrous tasks such as hiding in shades, stealing, or disarming traps extremely challenging actions.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a ''ring of clumsiness'' could be found within a massive [[Aurilian]] tempe erected by her cultist, allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, ''Jester's Folly'' was worn by an ill-humored [[Zhentish]] [[mage]] need [[Niemain]] who operated on the second floor of [[Sorcerous Sundries]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Notable Rings of Clumsiness==
*One notable ''Jester's Folly'' ring belonged to [[Gregoria the Foole]] who made a living exploiting its ''curse.'' Gregoria was a [[jester]] who called unlucky audience members on stage and sneakily replaced one of their rings with ''Jester's Folly''. Gregoria entertained the crowd by mocking the victim's crippling clumsiness to uproarious applause and laughter. When the performance was over, Gregoria the Foole switched the ring back (by revealed secret means) but only after the victim swore of no reprisals for public humiliation. Gregoria's last performance was in [[Zhentil Keep]] when a certain ill-humored mage did not appreciate being mocked.
