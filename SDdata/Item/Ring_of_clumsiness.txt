*One notable Jesters Folly ring belonged to Gregoria the Foole who made a living exploiting its curse. Gregoria was a jester who called unlucky audience members on stage and sneakily replaced one of their rings with Jesters Folly. Gregoria entertained the crowd by mocking the victims crippling clumsiness to uproarious applause and laughter. When the performance was over, Gregoria the Foole switched the ring back (by revealed secret means) but only after the victim swore of no reprisals for public humiliation. Gregorias last performance was in Zhentil Keep when a certain ill-humored mage did not appreciate being mocked.
