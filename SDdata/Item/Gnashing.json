        "Description": "Armor that had been enchanted with this quality would appear with many faces, often with cruel and vicious expressions, carved into its surface. These were often modeled to look like various [[fiend]]s and similar creatures.\n\nSuits crafted in the [[Nelanther Isles]] featured images of [[reaver]]s and [[ogre]]s.",
        "History": "The first ''gnashing'' armor was crafted by the [[cleric]] [[Ferstal]], a worshiper of [[Tiamat]] whose personal suit was crafted with the visage of dragon's heads."
