The '''''tarnished charm''''' was an [[amulet]] worn by the [[green hag|hag]] named [[Auntie Ethel]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The charm let out a horrific laugh in the mind or ears of its wearer, along with whispers urging them to bite, wound, and even kill others.

==Powers==
In contrast the disturbing auditory sensations experienced by its wearer, the ''tarnished charm'' granted them a beneficial boon found among many of the [[fey]] creatures of the Realms: inherent protection from death itself.

==History==
The amulet remained upon Auntie Ethel's person as of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
