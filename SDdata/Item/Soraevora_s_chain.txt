'''''Soraevora's chain''''' was a unique suit of [[chainmail]] that was sacred to the goddess [[Angharradh]], The Triune Goddess, from the [[elf|elven]] island of [[Evermeet]].

==Powers==
This beautiful {{SIAdj|20|lb|k|long=yes}} chainmail was expertly crafted by elven artisans of Evermeet and tailored specifically to [[Soraevora Aeravand]]'s body. The chainmail was decorated with a tabard that hid underneath a chain that held the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Angharradh in front of the wearer's heart. The armor possessed a ''+2'' protective [[enchantment]], gave them limited [[spell]] resistance, and improved the wearer's reflexes. The magical divine nature of ''Soraevora's chain'' ensured that it could only be worn by a [[favored soul]] who was an elf and who was both [[good]] and [[chaotic]] in spirit.

==History==
This chainmail's existence predated the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], likely by many centuries. The armor was worn a favored soul of Angharradh: the [[sun elf]] named Soraevora Aeravand of Evermeet. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Soraevora's [[deity]] sent her visions of doom and the elf embarked on a journey to the [[Sword Coast North]] to stop [[Zehir]], a [[yuan-ti]] interloper deity. ''Soraevora's chain'' accompanied her on the perilous quest.
