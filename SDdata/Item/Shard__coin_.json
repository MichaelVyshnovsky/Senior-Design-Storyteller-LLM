        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Open Lord]] [[Dagult Neverember]] instituted a tax of 1 shard per month to be collected from each resident over 10 years of age who lived in any of the wards of Waterdeep. The charge could be paid in advance for the entire year, in which case it took the discounted value of 1 [[Dragon (coin)|dragon]], but receipts had to be produced monthly nonetheless.\n\nIn the same period, a customary fee of 1 shard was charged after a conviction by a [[magister]], on top of any other fines.\n\nDuring wartime, a [[lance tax]] that consisted of 1 shard per household per [[tenday]] was imposed temporarily upon the city, until repealed by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]]."
