The Witch of the Dragon Waves was a ship sailing the Sea of Fallen Stars in the late 14 century DR.
The Witch of the Dragon Waves was a leaky cog.
Harnrim Starangh boarded the Witch of the Dragon Waves as a stowaway while it was docked in Marsember in Cormyr, after his scheme to steal the latest spell devised by Vangerdahast was dashed and thwarted by Elminster Aumar in the . He used magic to turn himself into one of the ships ballast stones. At that time, the ship was loaded with pickled beef.
Separately, the ship was boarded by Aumun Tholant Bezrar and Malakar Surth, as passengers rather than stowaways, seeking to go to Yhaunn in Sembia while trying to escape Marsember, as they too had been involved in Staranghs latest scheme. While the two had a disagreement shortly after raising anchors, it was interrupted by the appearance of a dragon matching the description of Aeglyl Dreadclaw.
