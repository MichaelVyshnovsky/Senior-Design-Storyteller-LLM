The '''''Witch of the Dragon Waves''''' was a ship sailing the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Witch of the Dragon Waves was a leaky [[cog]].

==History==
[[Harnrim Starangh]] boarded the ''Witch of the Dragon Waves'' as a stowaway while it was docked in [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]], after his scheme to steal the latest spell devised by [[Vangerdahast]] was dashed and thwarted by [[Elminster Aumar]] in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}. He used magic to turn himself into one of the ship's ballast stones. At that time, the ship was loaded with pickled beef.

Separately, the ship was boarded by [[Aumun Tholant Bezrar]] and [[Malakar Surth]], as passengers rather than stowaways, seeking to go to [[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]] while trying to escape Marsember, as they too had been involved in Starangh's latest scheme. While the two had a disagreement shortly after raising anchors, it was interrupted by the appearance of a [[dragon]] matching the description of [[Aeglyl Dreadclaw]].{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|377-378|Epilogue}}
