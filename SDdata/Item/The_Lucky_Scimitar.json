        "mainbody": "The Lucky Scimitar was the unique enchanted scimitar from Zakhara.\nThis aptly named scimitar had a +2 enchantment and improved the luck of its owner in everything they did. This luck included battles, skills, spells, defenses, etc. Additionally, this weapon allowed its user to cast the luck spell once per day.\nThe Lucky Scimitar originated from the land of Zakhara, where it was in possession of a famous gambler Kadan Ibn-Kadur. Stories claimed that his enchanted scimitar was what made him renowned for winning countless foolish bets. Eventually, the gambler of magical luck met someone even luckier than he was. Nido Ochita Inazuma, the son of a Cormyrean knight and a noble lady from Kara-Tur, was believed to have been born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, after his mother was struck by lightning twice while pregnant. Not being affected by Tymora nor Beshaba, Nido won the gamble that took the fabled Lucky Scimitar away from Kadan Ibn-Kadur.\nBy 1281 DR, the Lucky Scimitar ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar."
