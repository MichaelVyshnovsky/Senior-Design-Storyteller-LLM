'''Granite''' was a type of hard igneous rock found in many places in [[Faerûn]]<ref> and beyond.<ref>

==Description==
Granite was commonly grey in color, black,<ref> pink and white varieties also existed. Its hardness made tunneling into granite a difficult enterprise.<ref>

==History==
Sages versed in the topic assumed that granite was formed at high pressure within the earth.<ref>

==Quarries==
Granite was quarried in the following places in the Realms:
*[[Atalya]]n hills<ref>{{Cite dragon/214/Lost Empires}}
*[[Furrowed Mountains]]
*[[Mulhorand]], where granite was abundant.
*[[Red Cliffs]] in the [[High Moor]]<ref><ref><ref>
*[[The Ridge]]<ref>
*[[Teshendale]]<ref>
*[[Yhaunn]] in [[Sembia]]

It was also quarried on the [[planes]]:
*[[Hades#Pluton|Pluton]], [[Gray Waste]]<ref>
*Mountains around [[Tantlin]] on [[Stygia]], [[Baator]]<ref>{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited}}

==Other Granite Deposits in the Realms==

*[[Cliffs of Tanghai]] above the [[Hungtse River]]<ref><ref>
*[[Djerad Thymar]], [[Tymanther]]<ref>
*Dry ranges in the [[Endless Wastes]]<ref group="note">The "dry ranges" were the lower of the non-wooded mountain ranges in the Hordlands, namely the [[Dustwall]], [[Raurin Alta]], [[Teyla Shan]], [[Khopet-Dag]], and the [[Kora Shan]]. Their slopes were "of granite and shale", but it is not clear which range contained which type of stone, or if all contained both.

==Beyond Toril==
As a common type of stone, granite also occured and was used beyond Toril on the worlds of [[Aebrynis]],<ref>{{Cite book |author=[[Anne Brown]] |editor=[[Doug Stewart]] |title=Player's Secrets of Baruk-Azhik |date=1996 |publisher=[[TSR, Inc.]] |ISBN=0-7869-0376-8 |pages=1}} [[Athas]],<ref> [[Krynn]],<ref><ref> [[Mystara]],<ref><ref> and [[Oerth]].<ref><ref>

On the planes, granite occured in the [[Barrens of Doom and Despair]],<ref> and, like any other type of stone, in the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]].<ref> [[Earth (element)|Earth]] pockets within the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Magma]] manifested as granite pillars or rocks.<ref> Granite figures could sometimes be found on the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral]]: They were unfortunate visitors fallen victim to ''[[Petrification#Forms|fossilization]]''.<ref>

White granite deposits were also common in the deep valleys of [[Eronia]], the second layer of the [[Outer Planes|Outer Plane]] of [[Elysium]].

==Uses==
Granite was a common building material for stone fortifications.<ref>{{Cite dragon/145/Your Home Is Your Castle}} In Mulhorand, it was also favored for monuments, such as for the central crypt of a pyramid, and for the construction of tall, broad, ornate temples. In [[Chessenta]], granite was used for construction of temples.
