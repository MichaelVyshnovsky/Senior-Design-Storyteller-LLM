A '''''horn of command''''' was an [[enchanted]] musical instrument that amplified the user's voice.

==Powers==
The [[magic]] of a ''horn of command'' allowed the user to be heard at distances three times greater than normal. However, once per day the ''horn'' could be used to issue a ''[[suggestion]]'' to anyone within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} provided they spoke the same [[language]] as the wielder. The ''horn'' could also be targeted to a single individual. Doing this made it much harder for the target to resist the ''horn's'' magic.
