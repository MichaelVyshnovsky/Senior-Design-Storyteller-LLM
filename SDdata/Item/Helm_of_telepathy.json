        "mainbody": "A helm of telepathy was a magical helm that enabled telepathic communication between the wearer and another creature. It was also capable of issuing limited telepathic commands.\nThe wearer of a helm of telepathy could cast the detect thoughts spell at will. While connected to another creatures mind via concentrating on the spell, the helm allowed two-way telepathic communication between the wearer and the connected creature.\nAdditionally, the helm of telepathy allowed for the wearer to cast the suggestion spell on a connected creature. This power could be used only once per day, as the helm recovered this ability at the next dawn.\nLike most other items that allowed for distant communication, any conversation held through a helm of telepathy within the Nine Hells could be overheard by an archdevil."
