'''''Sparky Points''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[trident]] crafted by eccentric [[gnome]] inventor [[Yrre|Yrre the Sparkstruck]].

{{Quote|The question is - why not create another weapon with spikes like lightning bolts?|Yrre the Sparkstruck.}}

==Powers==
Whenever the wielder of ''Sparky Points'' struck another creature with the weapon, they accumulated a charge of electricity throughout their body. This charge built up in power, until it was discharged in a spark of lightning in one of their following attacks.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the trident remained in the possession of Councilor [[Florrick]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].
