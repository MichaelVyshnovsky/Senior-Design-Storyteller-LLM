Gondrollers were a type of humanoid-powered, three-wheeled vehicle developed by the Church of Gond that required relatively smooth trails.
These vehicles had soft, squashy fat tires and rear cargo beds.
Genuine gondrollers were rather rare and expensive, being only constructed and sold by temples of Gond. Those who saw them would often try to hire a smith to create them a knock-off, but even these were rare due to the difficulty of making the vehicles necessary axles, wheels, and tires.
