Cloaks of resistance were common enchanted garments that protected the wearer from harmful magics.
Cloaks of resistance varied in both power levels and designs.
Cloaks of resistance provided the wearer with increased protections against harmful effects of magics and mundane threats.
In the period of time between 1372 DR and 1374 DR, cloaks of resistance were popular items along the Sword Coast, found in stores, temples, and owned by heroes, criminals, wizards, and merchants.
There were many crafting options in creating these enchanted cloaks. Most of them included cloth and leather. Obsidian was used to create an item of +1 enchantment, diamond - +2, more rare canary diamond - +3, jacinth - +4, and lastly, blue diamond could be used to enchant a +5 cloak of resistance.
