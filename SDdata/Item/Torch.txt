A '''torch''' was a rod, most often made of wood, that could be lit to provide illumination in dark areas.
{{Quote
|Walking into the [[Underdark]] under a blazing torch is not the wisest move. A single [[candle]] would mark you as out of place and would leave you vulnerable.

These wooden implements often had one end covered in a cloth (or [[flax]]) that was doused with a flammable substance. They were popular with adventurers that explored dark avenues and darker dungeons.

As well as being used as a source of light, torches or fire sources equivalent to torches were used as [[material component]]s in [[spell]]s such as ''[[chariot of Sustarre]]'' and ''[[fire lance]]''. They could also be used as bludgeoning [[weapon]]s that might also ignite foes.

|Adventurer's torch
}}
There were several [[magic]]al torches across the [[Realms]]. The gateway to [[Deepearth]] from the [[Bloodstone Mines]] had torches that could not be put out by normal methods, and even had a very high resistance to magic.

A torch could be turned into an ''[[infratorch]]'', a torch that enabled those within its "light" radius to see as if they had infravision.

==Symbology==
[[File:Talmost.png|thumb|250px|''The Talmost family coat of arms.'']]
The [[Lords of Waterdeep]] were represented by a blazing torch, as was the [[Waterdhavian]] [[Talmost]] family.

[[Kossuth]]'s faithful were often named after blazing torches. After taking the [[Oath of Firewalking]], some Kossuthans became known as Torches of the Faith.

The first platform of the [[Pyramid of Uxma]] in [[Maztica]] was lit by [[pluma]] torches. They were coloured from red to orange to yellow to represent flames, and emitted ''[[continual light]]''.

The [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian deity]] [[Prometheus]] had a torch as his symbol.

==Notable Torches==
* ''[[Everburning torch]]es'' were torches lit by the ''[[continual flame]]'' spell.

* ''[[Torch of continual fire|Torches of continual fire]]'' were known to exist throughout [[Realmspace]]. They could be ignited or extinguished when a [[command word]] was spoken.

* ''[[Gruumsh's Everburning Torch]]'' was a torch that could never been extinguished, even via spells such as ''[[darkness]]'' and ''[[fire quench]]''.
