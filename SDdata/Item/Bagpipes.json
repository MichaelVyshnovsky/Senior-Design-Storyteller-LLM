Dwarves held bagpipes in high regard.\nthumb|left|Mizwid\nThe Zakharan version of the bagpipes was called mizwid (meaning \"food pouch\" in Midani). It was played with a double-reeded flute attached to the wind bag with corresponding two rows of holes where the melody could be played, while it produced an underlying droning tone at the same time.\n* The Pipes of Doom, a set of madness inducing bagpipes owned by the lich Pomerian."
