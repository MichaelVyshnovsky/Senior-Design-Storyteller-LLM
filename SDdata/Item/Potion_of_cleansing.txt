Potions of cleansing were magical concoctions that were used to cure harmful diseases.
Potions of cleansing, when consumed, alleviated illnesses and bodily afflictions as if under the effects of the remove disease spell.
Circa 1372 DR, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh, who feuded with the lizardman shaman Uzzak-Szalzik, possessed a rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews. Among them were a potion of cleansing of her own creation. These potions were available to any of the green hags allies against her sworn lizardfolk enemies.
