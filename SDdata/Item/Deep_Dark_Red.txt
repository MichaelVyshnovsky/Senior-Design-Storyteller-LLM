'''''Deep Dark Red''''' was the name given to a set of [[enchanted]] [[heavy armor]] that once belonged to [[Leustrarax]] of the [[Bear-Tooth tribe]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
This heavy set of armor was enchanted to improve the wearer's constitution and wisdom and made them appear terrifying to others, making intimidation easier. The armor's main purpose, however, was the magic that allowed the wearer to see in the dark as if by the ''[[Darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'' spell.

==History==
Sometime before 1372 DR, Leustrarax, a [[shaman]] of the Bear-Tooth tribe, pulled ''Deep Dark Red'' off the body of a knight who attempted to expand his fiefdom into the tribe's territory. Shortly after the knight's failed invasion, a rival tribe of the [[Bloody Tusk]] [[orc]]s attacked the Bear-Tooth tribe. The tribes fought fiercely until the Bear-Tooth tribe gained the upper hand and pushed the Bloody Tusks into a large cave. Leustrarax wore the ''Deep Dark Red'' armor that allowed him to see in the dark. He delved into the cave from whence the orcs came, found their chieftain, and put an end to his life with a single [[poison]]ed [[arrow]].

Many years later, ''Deep Dark Red'' was lost in an unsuccessful Bear-Tooth tribe raid on a well-guarded merchant caravan that moved south. By [[1372 DR]], the enchanted set of armor ended up in possession of [[Jonas Maxillian Senior]], an [[apple]] farmer and a secret [[werewolf]] of the [[Western Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]].
