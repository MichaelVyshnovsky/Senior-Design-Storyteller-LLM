Mirror masks were enchanted face coverings that protected the wearer from harmful gazes.
Mirror masks were round face masks, decorated with dark lines that radiated from the center point between the masks eyeholes.
These enchanted masks granted their wearers significant protection from monsters that used gaze abilities, such as medusas and basilisks. They also shielded the wearer from various spells that affected sight, such as flare, hypnotic pattern, or a vampires charm. Additionally, these masks reflected the faces of creatures that looked into them, making the wearer appear to have the same face.
Mirror masks could be created by skilled wondrous item crafters with the use of change self and resistance spells.
