'''''Mirror masks''''' were [[enchanted]] face coverings that protected the wearer from harmful gazes.

==Description==
''Mirror masks'' were round face [[mask (object)|masks]], decorated with dark lines that radiated from the center point between the masks' eyeholes.

==Powers==
These enchanted masks granted their wearers significant protection from monsters that used gaze abilities, such as [[medusa]]s and [[basilisk]]s. They also shielded the wearer from various spells that affected sight, such as ''[[flare]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', or a [[vampire]]'s ''[[charm]]''. Additionally, these masks reflected the faces of creatures that looked into them, making the wearer appear to have the same face.

==Creation==
''Mirror masks'' could be created by skilled wondrous item crafters with the use of ''[[change self]]'' and ''[[resistance]]'' spells.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Shamoor]]: one of the high-ranking members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] under [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s command in [[1369 DR]].
