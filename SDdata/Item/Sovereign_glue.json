        "mainbody": "Sovereign glue was a strong magical adhesive.\nA highly viscous, milky-white or amber substance, sovereign glue could only be stored in containers coated inside with oil of slipperiness. A container typically contained between one and seven ounces (0.02 to 0.2 liters), and one ounce could cover roughly a one-foot square (0.09 square meters). The substance gave off a strong transmutation aura.\nSovereign glue could permanently affix two objects to one another, creating a permanent and unbreakable adhesive bond. The substance took roughly a minute to set, during which time the objects could be separated and thereby nullifying the magical properties of the glue. If allowed to set, sovereign glue could only be broken through using universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or by employing a wish spell.\n* Certain traps in the Dungeon of Death were laced with sovereign glue."
