They usually consumed them, but sometimes exported them to places such as Halruaa and Durpar, who were keen on green bananas. A few places in Chult, particularly the Agricultural Quarter of Mezro, contained banana plantations.\nthumb|100px|Bananas hang from the ceiling of a Waterdhavian produce merchants stall.\nBananas were consumed by many races such as humans and halflings, The ashira, tree spirits of Zakhara, lived in banana trees (as well as trees bearing other fruits) and survived off of the bananas they produced. \nThe peel of these fruits was one of the material components required to cast Caddelyns catastrophe.\nBananas were known to be fried for consumption, originating the saying \"fried like a banana.\" Halflings from South Faerûn used bananas to flavor certain liqueurs and produced candied bananas to be shipped to their northern brethren.\n* There was a racing hadrosaurus in Port Nyanzaru known as Banana Candy.\n* A druid, who lurked within a cave in the deep forests of Chult, was known as the \"banana man\"."
