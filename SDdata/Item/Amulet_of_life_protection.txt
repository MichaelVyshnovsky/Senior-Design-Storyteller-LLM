An '''''amulet of life protection''''' was an [[enchanted]] piece of jewelry that offered protection for the psyche.

==Description==
Such amulets built after the Spellplague resembled rough chunks of clear-cut crystal with a golden chain.

==Powers==
Early information on such amulets claimed they made one immune to ''[[mind blast]]''{{cite dragon/138/Methods to Your Madness|40}} alongside mental influence. They were partway effective against the lifestealing powers of a [[demilich]].{{cite book/Monstrous Compendium Volume One|Lich}} However, it was not useful against a [[Deck of many things]], as it would simply be itself cast into a hidden plane with the wearer's soul still inside.{{cite polyhedron/2/Official Notice|3}}

When worn, these amulets and brooches protected against ''[[magic jar]]'' and similar magical attacks that attempted to take control of the victim's body. If the wearer was killed their spirit would enter the amulet and remain for seven days, departing for the afterlife when this time expired. Destroying an ''amulet of life protection'' that housed a spirit would utterly annihilate the spirit.

By the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, such ''amulets'' as found in [[Raven's Bluff]] could prevent the passing of the soul into the [[Fugue Plane]], allowing anyone to be resurrected within a space of 24 hours if they were healed.

Amulets created after the [[Spellplague]] increased the time through which one could still be raised from the dead, and improved the wearer's defenses in life somewhat.

==History==
One such ''amulet'' was meant to be used in an assassination attempt against [[Karsus]].

[[Mortimar]] of [[Netheril]] used one, smashed, to stage the death of his partner, [[Parzal]].{{cite book/Netheril: Empire of Magic/Encyclopedia Arcana|104}}
<!--[[Wardect]] of [[Trenton]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]] was interred with such an amulet in his [[Mausoleum of Wardect|mausoleum]].{{cite polyhedron/30|12}} If you're reading this, those are the wrong border kingdoms. Not the Realms ones, they surround the Gray Desert, not the Lake of Steam...-->
==Construction==
The amulets used in Raven's Bluff required the ''[[magic jar]]'' spell.
