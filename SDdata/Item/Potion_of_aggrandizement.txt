'''''Potion of aggrandizement''''' was a type of recreational magical [[potion]] from the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==Powers==
When consumed, these potions made even the tiniest people feel larger than life. When consumed by a small-statured [[humanoid]] such as a [[hin]] or a [[gnome]], the potion transformed their bodies and garb, making them as tall as a [[human]]. The potion's effects lasted for five minutes.

==History==
''Potions of aggrandizement'' saw recreational use during the annual [[Masquerade of Liars]] festival of Neverwinter in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
