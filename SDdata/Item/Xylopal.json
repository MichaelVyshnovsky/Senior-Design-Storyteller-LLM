        "mainbody": "{{Wikipedia article|wood opal}}\n'''Xylopal''' was a form of petrified wood with a more lustrous beauty.",
        "Description": "Xylopal was similar to [[tempskya]] (petrified wood) except the wood fiber was replaced by [[opal]] instead of [[wikipedia:en:quartz|quartz]].  Sometimes called opalized wood or lithoxyle, it was highly prized for its beauty (it made good bookends).  Especially detailed pieces could be used as inlays, statuettes, or for jewelry.  A typical price was 22sp per pound (49 sp/kg).",
        "Powers": "This hardstone was able to substitute for the material components of the ''[[reverse gravity]]'', specifically the iron filings and the lodestone. It required a hand-sized amount, either in a single stone or a bag of fragments."
