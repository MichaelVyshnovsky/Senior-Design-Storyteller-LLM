'''''Vlaakith''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[long sword]] created in honor of [[Vlaakith]], the Lich Queen of the [[Githyanki]] long before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The sword's blade was engraved with ancient [[Gith language]] circular runes that spelled the name "Vlaakith."

==Powers==
''Vlaakith'' possessed a potent ''+3'' enchantment that made the blade that more deadly and guided it towards the target. Each slash with the sword dealt additional crippling psychic damage that continued to hurt the opponent for 5 seconds after the attack. When ''Vlaakith'' was wielded against aberrations, its magics became devastating ''+8'' enchantments.

==History==
''Vlaakith'' was a blade of Githyanki-making, crafted shortly after the Gith revolted and freed themselves from the [[mind flayer]] oppression. By some unknown means, the blade found its way to [[Toril]] and by the late 15{{th}} century DR, it found its way into a locked chest within the [[deep gnome]] tax office in [[Grackelstugh]] in the [[Underdark]].
