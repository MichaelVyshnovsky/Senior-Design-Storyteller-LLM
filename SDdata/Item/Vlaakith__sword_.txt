Vlaakith was a powerful enchanted long sword created in honor of Vlaakith, the Lich Queen of the Githyanki long before the late 15 century DR.
The swords blade was engraved with ancient Gith language circular runes that spelled the name "Vlaakith."
Vlaakith possessed a potent +3 enchantment that made the blade that more deadly and guided it towards the target. Each slash with the sword dealt additional crippling psychic damage that continued to hurt the opponent for 5 seconds after the attack. When Vlaakith was wielded against aberrations, its magics became devastating +8 enchantments.
Vlaakith was a blade of Githyanki-making, crafted shortly after the Gith revolted and freed themselves from the mind flayer oppression. By some unknown means, the blade found its way to Toril and by the late 15 century DR, it found its way into a locked chest within the deep gnome tax office in Grackelstugh in the Underdark.
