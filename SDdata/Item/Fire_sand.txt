Fire sand  was a dangerous magical sand found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, that created intense sheets of flame.
Fire sand could be used in two ways as a burning wall, or as an area spell. Fire sand could be thrown up to 20 feet (6 m) and covered a 10 foot by 10 foot square area. The magical sand ignited upon impact with the ground, burning everything within its effective area. If poured into a line, or any other shape, and then ignited with a flame or when struck, fire sand would create a burning wall that burned hotter than thrown fire sand. A 20 foot wall could be created per handful of sand used. Once activated, fire sand burned for 3-12 minutes.
