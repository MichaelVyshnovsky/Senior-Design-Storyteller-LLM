        "Description": "This clear [[semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was considered lower grade if it was soft or brittle, but was frequently used to adorn furniture or decorative head gear. High grade samples free from impurities were used for optics, eyeglasses, [[magnifying glass]]es, and prisms. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "When a spell required an unspecified [[gem]] of a certain value, rock crystals were generally used. There was a process that could turn a quantity of rock crystals into a molten glass-like state that allowed it to be worked into weapons and other implements. When it cooled, the rock crystal was hard enough to be used for [[mace]] heads, [[spear]] heads, ram heads, or even climbing spikes. The process required three spells; two of which were minor but kept secret, and ''[[Veladar's vambrace]]''.\n\n[[Mezro]]an [[wizard]]s, namely [[Ras T'fima]], had a way of using colored quartz crystals on a recently dead creature that shared link thigh their masters. If the dead creature was able to share its sight with the master, this ritual allowed the wizard to see through the dead creature's master's eyes for a short period of time.\n\nQuartz lenses had some alchemical use. They could be caused and ground into glittering grains of crystal. This essence of crystalline lens could be combined with certain types of alchemical [[salt]]s to create ''[[elixirs of darkvision]]''.",
        "Reputation": "Rock crystal was a common stone among ornament among the [[drow]] of average station. It was normal for them to shape these gems into tear shapes for use as decoration on black clothes.\n\nThe [[gem dragon]] [[sorceress]] [[Nyadnar]] had a house with walls made of transparent, paneled quartz."
