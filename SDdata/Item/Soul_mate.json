        "mainbody": "A '''''soul mate''''' was a holy [[sword]].",
        "Description": "'''''Soul mates''''' were often made of a blue [[steel]] alloy. They had plain steel pommels with [[ray]]-skin grips and short guards. There were invisible [[rune]]s along their lengths, identifying their purpose. They created choruses of angelic notes and halos of light when their powers were called upon.",
        "Powers": "Though they could perform normally in anyone's hands as merely enchanted swords of superior power, when wielded by [[paladin]]s they were wielded with greater deadliness. Furthermore, they enhanced their wielder's ability to [[turn undead]] and they improved their defense against magic that sought to snuff out their lives or quench their lifeforce.\n\nMuch like a ''[[holy avenger]]'', it could also project a circle to unmake malevolent magic around it if wielded by a paladin.",
