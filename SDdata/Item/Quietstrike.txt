Quietstrike was a unique enchanted sentient short sword located in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
In addition to making it easier for its wielder to strike and harm an opponent, Quietstrike could detect secret doors and detect shifting walls and rooms. 
The sword was carried by Fulbar Hardcheese, a halfling thief and owner of the Happy Cow.
