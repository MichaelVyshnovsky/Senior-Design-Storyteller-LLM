        "Description": "The artengak was designed specifically for [[seal]] hunting. An artengak possessed a slender profile compared to the [[unungak]] but shared a comparable bone tip. Its primary function was as a hunting tool. A lengthy cord was attached to the shaft, terminating in a loop that the hunter securely fastened around their wrist. This cord served the purpose of preventing the game from eluding the weapon, ensuring a successful capture."
