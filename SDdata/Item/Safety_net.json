        "mainbody": "A '''''safety net''''' was a rope enchanted with [[Darsson Spellmaker]]'s ''[[safe fall]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Description": "These ropes were made from [[giant spider]] or [[ettercap]] [[silk]] and were available in lengths of {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}, {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}, and {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "Once tied into a loop, a ''safety net'' created a ''[[feather fall]]'' effect that operated both vertically, horizontally, and at any angle. The ''safety net'' would eliminate the perpendicular inertia of whatever approached it. Thus, a ''safety net'' placed horizontally would impart a ''feather fall'' for someone falling down on top of it.\n\nThe limit on the amount of weight that could be affected was {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} plus a number of pounds equal to twice the rope's length in feet. Multiple nets could be used to increase the area affected, but the weight limit was determined by the smaller net."
