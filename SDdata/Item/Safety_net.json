The safety net would eliminate the perpendicular inertia of whatever approached it. Thus, a safety net placed horizontally would impart a feather fall for someone falling down on top of it.\nThe limit on the amount of weight that could be affected was  plus a number of pounds equal to twice the ropes length in feet. Multiple nets could be used to increase the area affected, but the weight limit was determined by the smaller net."
