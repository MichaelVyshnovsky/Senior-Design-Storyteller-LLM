        "Recipe": "There were many variations of this drink, but a typical recipe started with a strong-flavored beer or ale. [[Moon Mountain Dark]] was a favored base for [[humans]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].\n* a small keg of beer or ale\n* a handful of sugar\n* two pinches of [[nutmeg]] powder\n* some [[wikipedia:en:clove|cloves]]\n* some [[blackroot]]\n* a handful of [[ginger root]] powder\n* a slice of [[apple]] or [[lime]]\n* a splash of rum\nAll ingredients except the rum were heated in a pot to the verge of boiling. When the brew was ready, the rum was added and pot was removed from the heat, stirred, and allowed to cool for a short time (one or two verses of a drinking song was about right)."
