Typically, the robes were created in colors corresponding to the alignment of the wearer white was usually made for good magic users, gray for neutral, and black for evil. It was impossible to attune to a robe of the archmagi of the wrong alignment.\nIt was believed by some that black robes of the archmagi could be \"redeemed\" into a set of white robes, by means of powerful magic and significant wealth.\nThe robe of the archmagi provided its wearer with magical and physical defenses, as well as improving the users magical prowess.\nPre-Spellplague, it was common for these items to severely weaken the wearer if they attempted to wear a mismatched-alignment robe, for as long as they wore it.\nThe neutral, gray robes of the archmagi were said to have originated from the Ulcaster School of Wizardry.\nBlack robes of the archmagi were crafted in significant numbers by the Zhentarim of the 14 century DR.\nthumb|200px|Laeral Silverhand wearing her white robe of the archmagi.\n* Aumvor the Undying, the malevolent Netherese lich that dwelled within the Endless Caverns.\n* Errard, the benevolent mage of Saradush.\n* Iggwilv, the archfey of Prismeer in the Feywild.\n* Hadrhune, the shade of Thultanthar wore a black robe of the archmagi.\n* Maligor, the Zulkir of Alteration in Thay until the , wore a hooded robe of the archmagi of dark red color.\n* Manshoon, a clone of his wore a black robe of the archmagi.\n* Laeral Silverhand, who wore a white robe of the archmagi as the Open Lord of Waterdeep.\n* Sammaster, a former Chosen of Mystra and a founder of the Cult of the Dragon, acquired a robe of the archmage in .\n* Szass Tam, zulkir of necromancy and supreme regent of Thay."
