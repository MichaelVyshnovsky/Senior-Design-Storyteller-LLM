        "mainbody": "A '''''robe of the archmagi''''' was a rare and powerful robe worn only by the most powerful spellcasters.",
        "Description": "These magnificent and elegant robes were often made out of the most expensive cloth of white, gray, or black color and decorated with silvery magical runes. Typically, the robes were created in colors corresponding to the alignment of the wearer: white was usually made for [[good]] magic users, gray for [[neutral]], and black for [[evil]]. It was impossible to attune to a ''robe of the archmagi'' of the wrong alignment.\n\nIt was believed by some that black ''robes of the archmagi'' could be \"redeemed\" into a set of white robes, by means of powerful magic and significant wealth.",
        "Powers": "The ''robe of the archmagi'' provided its wearer with magical and physical defenses, as well as improving the user's magical prowess.\n\nPre-[[Spellplague]], it was common for these items to severely weaken the wearer if they attempted to wear a mismatched-alignment robe, for as long as they wore it.",
        "History": "The neutral, gray ''robes of the archmagi'' were said to have originated from the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]].\n\nBlack ''robes of the archmagi'' were crafted in significant numbers by the [[Zhentarim]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
