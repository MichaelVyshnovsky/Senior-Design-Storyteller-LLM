'''''Clan Solar'el daggers''''' were [[enchanted]] blades wielded by the [[assassin]]s of the [[elvish]] [[Clan Solar'el]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Clan Solar'el daggers'' possessed a quality ''+2'' enchantment to their damage and the same enchantment guided the wielder's hand towards the targets. The same magic also allowed the [[dagger]] to harm creatures otherwise unaffected by mundane weapons. Each slash with such dagger dealt additional radiant damage and, when wielded against [[fiend]]s, its magics effectively became a devastating ''+8'' enchantment.

==History==
The elvish Clan Solar'el was known as virtuois defenders of all that is good, who helmed a war against fiends and their allies. It was believed that some of the ''Clan Solar'el daggers'' once pierced the demon [[Belaphoss]]. In the ;ate 15{{th}} centur DR, a gang of Clan Solar'el assassins attacked the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] and their allies, mistakingly believing them to be thralls of Belaphoss. The assassins were defeated, leaving behind a damaged ''Clan Solar'el dagger'' that may had eventually been reforged by a master from [[Luskan]], using shards of the similar weapons found in the lair of [[Rhylfang]].
