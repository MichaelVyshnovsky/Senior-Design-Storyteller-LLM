A '''''staff of fire''''' was a [[magic]]al [[staff]] that granted its wielder a number of flame-related, [[spell]]-like abilities.{{Cite web/Hoard of the Dragon Queen/Tyranny of Dragons Online Supplement|2}}

==Powers==
The wielder of this staff was resistant to fire while it was in their hands.

A fully charged ''staff'' possessed ten charges. Its wielder could cast either ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', or ''[[wall of fire]]'' from the staff, expending either one, three, or four charges respectively. Each morning at dawn the staff would regain a number of charges. However, if ever all the charges were expended, there was a small chance the staff would disintegrate into a pile of ash and cinders.
