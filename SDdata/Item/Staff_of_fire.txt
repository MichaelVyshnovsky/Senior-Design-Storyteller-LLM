A staff of fire was a magical staff that granted its wielder a number of flame-related, spell-like abilities.
The wielder of this staff was resistant to fire while it was in their hands.
A fully charged staff possessed ten charges. Its wielder could cast either burning hands, fireball, or wall of fire from the staff, expending either one, three, or four charges respectively. Each morning at dawn the staff would regain a number of charges. However, if ever all the charges were expended, there was a small chance the staff would disintegrate into a pile of ash and cinders.
