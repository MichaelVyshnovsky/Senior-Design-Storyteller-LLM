        "mainbody": "'''Chalcedony''' was a [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] that was the base mineral in many gem-quality stones, but in the Realms the more colorful varieties all had their own names (see below). In [[Faer√ªn]], chalcedony referred to the mostly colorless versions of these gemstones.",
        "Description": "The vast majority of chalcedony gems were white to off-white, rarely shading to gray or black. They could be found in deposits that yielded large gem-quality stones that could be carved into statuettes or coffers. Smaller stones were typically cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] and polished, often giving them a resemblance to [[ivory]]. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Varieties": "Chalcedony took on a wide variety of colors, each with their own unique properties:\n* [[Agate]]: the entire family of agates that spanned the rainbow\n* [[Bloodstone]]: green-gray with red inclusions\n* [[Carnelian]]: red to reddish brown\n* [[Chrysocolla]]: green to blue-green\n* [[Chrysoprase]]: light apple-green\n* [[Crown of silver]]: metallic silver with black bands",
        "Powers": "This stone was used in the creation of magic items that conferred protection from the [[undead]] or control over them. For [[necromantic]] purposes, this gem could be used instead of [[human]] bone, improving the efficacy of items dealing with nonhuman undead.\n\nCrushed to a powder and enchanted with an easy spell, chalcedony added to an alcoholic beverage prevented intoxication without altering the taste of the drink, making it a favorite of agents and spies that needed to keep their wits sharp.",
        "Trivia": "The lesser deity [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send black-hued chalcedony to show his favour or disfavour to his followers."
