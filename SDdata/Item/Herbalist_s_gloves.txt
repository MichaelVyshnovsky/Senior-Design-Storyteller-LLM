Herbalists gloves were magic gloves that aided their owner in the art of healing.
Herbalists gloves were made out of fine leather. They exuded a light scent of various herbs as if the leather was cured in a floral bath.
The gloved possessed an enchantment that improved any healing administered by the wearer. They removed any toxins or poisons from the body of the creature that was healed.
In 1492 DR, Derryth Bonecloak, a herbalist from Baldurs Gate, owned a pair of these magical gloves. She, alongside her feeblemind affected husband traveled from the Gray Harbor to a friendly myconid colony in Underdark to search for cure-all mushrooms called noblestalks.
