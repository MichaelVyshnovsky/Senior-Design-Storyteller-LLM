'''''Herbalist's gloves''''' were magic gloves that aided their owner in the art of ''[[heal|healing]]''.

==Description==
''Herbalist's gloves'' were made out of fine leather. They exuded a light scent of various [[herb]]s as if the leather was cured in a floral bath.

==Powers==
The gloved possessed an enchantment that improved any healing administered by the wearer. They removed any toxins or [[poison]]s from the body of the creature that was healed.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], [[Derryth Bonecloak]], a herbalist from [[Baldur's Gate]], owned a pair of these magical gloves. She, alongside her ''[[feeblemind]]'' affected husband traveled from the Gray Harbor to a friendly [[myconid]] colony in [[Underdark]] to search for cure-all [[mushroom]]s called [[noblestalk]]s.
