        "mainbody": "The '''''Veil of the Morning''''' was a set of powerful magical [[robe]]s that protected their wearer from the [[undead]].",
        "Description": "This robe was created from [[celestial]] feathers, bottled sunlight, and [[ink]] extracted from the sacred pages of a holy [[book]] of some unspecified denomination.",
        "Powers": "The robe's protective aura made all attacks by undead much harder to land on the wearer and it granted a significantly higher chance of resisting and avoiding the abilities, actions, and magics of undead creatures. Additionally, the robe allowed the wearer to ''[[turn undead]]'' once per day.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Veil of the Morning'' was in the hands of the mysterious and powerful [[mummy]] known as [[Mystic Carrion]], who laired in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], offering his magical skills to the wealthy citizens."
