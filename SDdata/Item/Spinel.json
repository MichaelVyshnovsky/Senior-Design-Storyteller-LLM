        "mainbody": "The precious stone spinel was not native to North Faer√ªn. Spinels came to the region from traders with the Southwest and from visitors to Kara-Tur.\nRed spinels were said to come from southern desert country, while blue spinels came from the east, and the rare green spinels came from the jungles of Chult and Mhair. All types were transparent or translucent and durable. A typical blue specimen had a base value of 500 gp while the red to green shades were valued at around 100 gp.\nRed spinels were considered sacred by followers of Haela Brightaxe&mdashappropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The green variety of spinel was sacred to followers of Thard Harr.\nIf a spinel was crushed in a particular way and then ingested, a spellcasting creature could instantly remember (and recast) the last spell cast.\nSpinel was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit they only used those of deep blue color."
