        "mainbody": "Tombsweeper was an enchanted morning star that crushed many undead creatures in its past.\nTombsweeper possessed a +3 enchantment.\nSometime before 1281 DR, Tombsweeper belonged to a humorous fighter named Seldon Mirai, who felt no fear in the face of the undead. He was known to carelessly stroll into undead-infested tombs, making jokes and smashing shambling dead with the Tombsweeper. Eventually, his attitude towards necromancers creations attracted the ire of a powerful lich called Tiron. The irked lich placed a paralyzing curse on the warrior and ordering his skeletons to clobber him to death. Later, Tiron, ironically, raised Seldon Mirai as one of his mindless servants.\nBy 1281 DR, Tombsweeper ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar."
