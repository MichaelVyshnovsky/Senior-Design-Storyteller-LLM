        "History": "Sometime before [[1281 DR]], ''Tombsweeper'' belonged to a humorous fighter named [[Seldon Mirai]], who felt no fear in the face of the undead. He was known to carelessly stroll into undead-infested tombs, making jokes and smashing shambling dead with the ''Tombsweeper''. Eventually, his attitude towards [[necromancer]]s' creations attracted the ire of a powerful [[lich]] called [[Tiron]]. The irked lich placed a [[paralyze|paralyzing]] curse on the warrior and ordering his skeletons to clobber him to death. Later, Tiron, ironically, raised Seldon Mirai as one of his mindless servants.\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], ''Tombsweeper'' ended up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]]."
