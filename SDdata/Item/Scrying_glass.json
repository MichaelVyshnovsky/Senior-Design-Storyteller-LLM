This magic hand mirror did not allow the owner to use scrying magic, nor could it be used to communicate across distance. Instead, the scrying glass could be held in hand and used to identify magic items reflected in it. Its magic had limited use but it could detect cursed items.\nThe scrying glass dated back to the era of the ancient Myth Drannor, the City of Song. In the , the scrying glass could be found in the citys ruined Mages Guild, which was infested with ravenous ogre slugs.\nAnother scrying glass was known to exist sometime in the 14 century DR, being hidden within a mysterious dungeon that became the target of a powerful unnamed sorceress who sought to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
