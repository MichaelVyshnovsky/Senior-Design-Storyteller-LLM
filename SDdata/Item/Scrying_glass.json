        "mainbody": "The '''''scrying glass''''' was [[enchanted]] hand [[mirror]] that allowed its users to discern the true nature of [[magic item]]s.",
        "Powers": "The name of the ''scrying glass'' was a misnomer. This magic hand mirror did not allow the owner to use ''[[scrying]]'' magic, nor could it be used to communicate across distance. Instead, the ''scrying glass'' could be held in hand and used to ''[[identify]]'' magic items reflected in it. Its magic had limited use but it could detect ''[[cursed]]'' items.",
        "History": "The ''scrying glass'' dated back to the era of the ancient [[Myth Drannor]], the City of Song. In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the ''scrying glass'' could be found in the city's ruined [[Mages' Guild]], which was infested with ravenous [[ogre slug]]s.\n\nAnother ''scrying glass'' was known to exist sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], being hidden within a mysterious dungeon that became the target of a powerful unnamed [[sorceress]] who sought to retrieve the equally mysterious magical orb from its depths."
