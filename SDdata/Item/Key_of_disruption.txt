Keys of disruption were a variety of enchanted keys that could seal any lock
When pressed into any normal lock, a key of disruption would change its size and shape to fit it perfectly. Once the key was turned, the lock would be mystically sealed and could neither be opened nor picked unless the same key of disruption was used to open it again. However, if the lock was that of a door, then the knock spell could be used to open it.
Keys of disruption could not affect magical locks. If a wielder attempted to use a key of disruption on a magical lock, there was a chance they would be inflicted with a shock of magical energy.
Most guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more keys of disruption.
