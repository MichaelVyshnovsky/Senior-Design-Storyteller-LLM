        "mainbody": "nowflake Obsidian was a variety of obsidian found in large deposits of volcanic origin.\nThis ornamental stone was black volcanic glass with grayish splashes in the matrix that often exhibited snowflake-like symmetry if cut correctly. It was brittle and weak, but could be used for small carvings. It was either tumbled and sold as a gemstone, or quarried in \"trade blocks\" (large, irregular chunks) of up to 25 lb (12 kg) each.\nSnowflake obsidian could mitigate damage to creatures or objects from dragons breath. A piece of this gemstone at least the size of a thumbnail had to be worn on the outside of armor or mounted on the outer surface of an object. When exposed to dragons breath, the stone absorbed an unpredictable portion of the damage and disintegrated.\nCategoryOrnamental stones\nCategoryGems\nCategory0-24 gold pieces\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nn08sjsgfjn3k1o1dbfvvcx7d6xg61wa"
