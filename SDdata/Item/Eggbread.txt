Eggbread, also known as eggfry bread,
Eggbread was a savory treat that was never served as a dessert. Most commonly, it was served with various gravies, panfry drippings, and condiments made of spices like tamarind. Some travelers and caravaners were known for eating egg bread as a "desperation fare," dripped with molasses. However, that was not considered a proper way to consume the dish. The most common way to eat it was smothered in fat droppings from frying pork, topped with salted pork and cracklings.
*In the City of Splendors, Waterdeep, circa 1370s DR, small eateries that traded in hot drinks and hot handfoods started cropping up throughout its various districts. By the , the city counted over 30 such establishments. One of the newly popular dishes found in many of them were eggbread buns topped with melted sugar.
*The Oak-Fathers Boon inn in Tethyrean town of Mosstone served medallions of eggbread with the signature bowl of hares dish â€“ long-stewed hare meat in cloves, cinnamon, and leek.
