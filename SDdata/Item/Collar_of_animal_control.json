        "mainbody": "'''''Collars of animal control''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Collar (animal)|animal collars]] that allowed one to force [[animal]]s to obey mental commands.",
        "Description": "A ''collar of animal control'' was made of a thick leather, covered in markings and runes sacred to the [[deity]] [[Malar]]. Each collar bore a miniature [[iron]] [[chain]].",
        "Powers": "These collars could be resized to fit around the neck of any animal. Once successfully put on an animal, the miniature chain on a ''collar of animal control'' would detach and those who held it would have control over the animal in a manner similar to the [[spell]] ''[[dominate animal]]''. However, this mental link would end if the matching chain was not being held or if the animal was more than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} away from the wielder. Additionally, if given a command that was obviously self-destructive, an animal might try to fight back against the command, potentially breaking the enchantment.",
        "History": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Kazok]] a member of the [[Malarite]] organization [[Furious Hunt]], terrorized the town of [[Berlingford]] in the [[Silver Marches]] with packs of [[wild dog]]s and [[wolves]]<ref>{{Cite dungeon/103/Forest of Blood|41}} that he and his thugs commanded with ''collars of animal control''.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/103/Forest of Blood|50,56}} This domination of the local wolves angered the [[awaken]]ed wolf [[Felinal]], whose master had been kidnapped by Kazok, but it was reluctant to attack the Malarites lest it fall victim to their ''collars of animal control''.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/103/Forest of Blood|50}}"
