'''''Finch's leather armor''''' was a unique set of [[leather armor]] worn by the daring [[half-elven]] [[bard]] [[Finch (half-elf)|Finch]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The armor was designed to be functional and to look stylish. It was dyed dashing red and was ensorcelled to possess a ''+2'' [[enchanted|enchantment]] and to offer significant resistance to enemy [[spell]]s. However, the leathers' magics made it only wearable by half-elven bards who served the powers of good.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Finch wore his red leathers while performing in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and adventuring across the [[Sword Coast North]].
