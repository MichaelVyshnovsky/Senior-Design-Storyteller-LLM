Fog-cutters were a type of lantern specifically designed to illuminate through fog.
The design of the fog-cutter was similar to the bullseye lantern, with the addition of an amber-colored focusing lens that illuminated foggy areas better than a regular lantern. It was inspired by lanterns used in lighthouses with a similar mechanism to illuminate through sea fog.
Fog-cutters were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
