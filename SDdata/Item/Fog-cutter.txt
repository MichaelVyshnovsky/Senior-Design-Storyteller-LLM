'''Fog-cutters''' were a type of [[lantern]] specifically designed to illuminate through fog.

==Description==
The design of the fog-cutter was similar to the [[bullseye lantern]], with the addition of an [[amber]]-colored focusing [[Optic aid|lens]] that illuminated foggy areas better than a regular lantern. It was inspired by lanterns used in lighthouses with a similar mechanism to illuminate through sea fog.

Fog-cutters were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
