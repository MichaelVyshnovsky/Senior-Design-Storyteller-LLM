A '''''faith token''''' was a small [[magic]]al item attuned to a specific [[deity]] that allowed it's wielder to cast minor [[spell]]s. They were typically given to novice clergy within a church, kept until their powers outgrew its usefulness, and re-gifted to a more junior acolyte.

==Appearance==
Typically appearing as a small charm, stamped with a deity's [[holy symbol]], a ''faith token'' was often worn around the neck as [[jewelry]]. They could be made from wood, bone, metal or whatever was appropriate for the particular wearer's faith. Depending on the deity after whom one were crafted, a token would glow, hum, or flash brightly when activated.

==Powers==
A token was typically enhanced with a [[cantrip]] or two and granted those powers, to whomever held its possession, twice per day. They were activated by the wearer uttering a [[command word]], which was typically just the patron deity's name, though could be a particular phrase if so desired.

The spells were suited for the deity's [[portfolio]].
