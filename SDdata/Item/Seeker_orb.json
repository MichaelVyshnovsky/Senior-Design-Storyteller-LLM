        "mainbody": "eeker orbs, were wizardly crystal orb implements that glistened with brillian magical light inside, popularized in the 15 century DR.\nSeeker orbs helped wizards focus on the most vulnerable parts of the targets, making their spells strike true and deal more damage. With each critical spells strike, brilliant luminescence inside the orbs flared.\nIn the 15 century DR, various seeker orbs could be found in possession of spellcasters in the Sword Mountains, Neverwinter Wood, areas surrounding the city and markets of Neverwinter, and found in the ruins of Illefarn."
