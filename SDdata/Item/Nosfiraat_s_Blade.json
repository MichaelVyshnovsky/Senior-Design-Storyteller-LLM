        "History": "''Nosfiraat's Blade'' was one of the golden scimitars that belonged to the famous merchant [[Daavid Ali Fazeer]] ''circa'' [[1322 DR]]. Daavid claimed the swords were found aboard a [[ghost ship]] that was sunken shortly after the merchant's excursion onto the vessel. Interestingly enough, Daavid Ali Fazeer refused to say whether the ship's crew became [[ghost]]s before or after his involvement.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]] the bale was in the possession of its namesake, the Zakharan [[vampire]] [[Nosfiraat]]."
