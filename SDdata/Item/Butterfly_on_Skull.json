        "mainbody": "'''''Butterfly on Skull''''' was a still life painting created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This prediction of still life showed a skillfully painted scene of a fanned [[book]], a bottle of [[wine]], a vase with a red-leafed plant inside, and a skull. All items are arranged behind a string of [[kudzu]] ivy with an orange and black [[butterfly]] sat atop the skull. It was unknown how the painter managed to keep the butterfly on the skull during the painting.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Butterfly on Skull'' painting could be found hanging on a wall in the farthest room of the [[Candulhallow's Tombstones]] shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The painting hid a terrible secret â€“ a switch that exposed a secret door that led to a lair of a [[Bhaalist]] cult underneath the city."
