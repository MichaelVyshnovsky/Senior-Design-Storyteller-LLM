The '''''whirling scimitar''''' was a [[Zakhara]]n [[magic]]al weapon that could bestow the ability to fly.

==Description==
This item usually appeared as a [[scimitar]], but versions in the form of a [[broadsword]] or [[two-handed sword]] also existed. It was most common in the lands of Zakhara but could be found elsewhere, too.

==Powers==
Used in a fight, the ''whirling scimitar'' showed a stronger magical attack potential against flying creatures than against others and a still stronger one against those from the [[Elemental Plane of Air]]. When whirled above the head of the wielder instead of attacking, it bestowed the ability of a ''[[fly]]'' spell. The ability to fly stopped immediately if the wielder lost hold of the weapon.
