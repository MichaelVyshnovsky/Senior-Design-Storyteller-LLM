        "mainbody": "Mindstars were enchanted amulets used by the thief members of the Night Masks guild of Westgate, and previously, of Cormyr, in the late 14 century DR.\nA Mindstar amulet allowed the wearer, after a moment of deep concentration, to become more perceptive for a limited period of time. This perceptiveness was effortless and passive, needing no concentration from the wearer, allowing them to use their mind for other things, like spotting hidden details, searching, and audition. The greater the wearers skills in concentration were â€“ the greater the benefits of a Mindstar were. Each amulet could only be activated twice per day.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Night Masks were driven out of Cormyr by King Azoun Obarskyr IV, however, some of these amulets were left behind, occasionally appearing in the hands of merchants and eager adventurers."
