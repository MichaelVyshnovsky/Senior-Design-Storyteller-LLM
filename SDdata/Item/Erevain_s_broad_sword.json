        "Powers": "''Erevain's broad sword'' possessed ''+2'' enchantment as well as granted its user improved protection against spells slung via magic ''[[wand]]s'' and increased resistance to [[acid]].",
        "History": "This broadsword was forged in [[1221 DR]] by the [[Greycloaks]] of [[Evereska]]. Later, the sword belonged to Erevain Blacksheaf, an adventurer who traveled to [[Icewind Dale]] in 1281 DR. Subsequently, Erevain was slain by monstrous [[spider]]s of [[Dragon's Eye]] with his broadsword by his side."
