        "mainbody": "Deathwyrm cloaks were a type of magical cloak used by the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR.\nThe cloak was long, black, and scaly.\nThe deathwyrm cloaks offered some protection from raw magical force damage, but mainly improved the power of the wearers negative energy spells and increased the effect of negative energy upon themselves, making them useful for those that regenerated with negative energy like the undead and pale master necromancers.\nThe Cult of the Dragon forces that followed Aurgloroasa in Thunderholme used a number of these cloaks in the 1480s DR."
