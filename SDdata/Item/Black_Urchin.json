        "Powers": "''Black Urchin'' was designed by the [[duergar]]s to resemble a blackblood urchin, a species of venomous shellfish found in the seas of the Underdark. Such shields were made of [[iron]] and often appeared black and strained with rust. The shield's front was covered in rusted barbs. Each time the shield bashed a target or an attacker pricked themselves, its barbs injected the target with harmful toxins.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, one ''Black Urchin'' shield was wielded by [[Harhord Dorm]], a duergar bodyguard of [[Barud Barzam]], who was placed in charge of an old duergar stronghold in the [[River Caves]], where the [[Black Raven River]] emerged and ran south in [[northwest Faerûn]]."
