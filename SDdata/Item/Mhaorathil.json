        "mainbody": "'''''Mhaorathil''''' was a magical [[short sword]] for [[dwarves]] and one of the ''[[baneblades of Demron]]'' created in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "It was a short sword designed to be wielded by dwarves, weighing 2 pounds (0.91 kilograms). It emitted an orange light when drawn, shining as bright as a [[torch]], but its light could be suppressed at the wielder's thought.",
        "Powers": "''Mhaorathil'' it was a ''+4 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'' weapon that was a ''[[bane (property)|bane]]'' to both [[undead]] and [[evil]] [[outsider]]s. Moreover, it let its wielder use ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[remove disease]]'', and use ''[[disrupting weapon]]'', each once a day. However, it was only usable by dwarves, and was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.",
        "History": "It was crafted by the archmage [[Demron]] before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], being the second of his series of ''baneblades''. It was designed to be used by the dwarven defenders of the city."
