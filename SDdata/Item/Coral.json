        "mainbody": "'''Coral''' was formed by very tiny animals in the warm seas of the ''Realms'' (including the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]). It was not a gemstone in the traditional sense of having been mined from underground, but after being treated, cut, and polished, it was considered a [[fancy stones|fancy gemstone]]. Coral was also favored by the [[Elf|elven]] god [[Deep Sashelas]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}",
        "Description": "After being harvested from the water, coral was baked in the sun to dry it out and remove the smell of decaying marine life. It was then ready for polishing and carving. Branch-like specimens were sometimes used as the stems and leaves of ornamental flowers created from other gems. The pink and crimson varieties of coral were in the highest demand. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "Powdered coral was a very desirable ingredient in creating ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'' and ''[[potion of extra healing|extra healing]]'' because it guaranteed a greater minimum effectiveness for those healing draughts. Knowledge of this property of coral was prevalent in [[South Faer√ªn]] were coral was found in abundance.",
        "Species": "* [[Angelar's skin]]\n* [[Brain coral]], a sentient species resembling a brain.",
        "Usages": "In [[Halruaa]]n city of [[Khaerbaal]], the [[Reef Street]] was notable for all of its buildings being built, grown, and shaped out of living corals via a lot of effort, time, and expensive magic. Special seawater [[aqueduct]]s were constructed to carry water via marvelous water pumps built by the city's [[artificer]]s. Water was transported across Reef Street. ''[[Oortal]]s'' that summoned coral animals were into seawater and guided to grow formations along the wooden \"skeletons\" of new buildings. Coral tructures had various hues, from pale sandy pink to dark rosy.\n\nAs of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[sea elves]] were known to work red coral into the designs of ornate furniture."
