Haerlu wine, also known as Haerlu Gold, was a strong aged alcoholic drink that was as much of Halruaas nation symbol as its skyships.
Haerlu Gold was renown for its fiery taste. The pale golden alcohol was served in decanters and drank in single gulps from small goblets. Southerners, like those from Mulhorand, liked to add a splash of this potent brandy to green tea brewed with honey and ginger.
By the late 14 century DR, Haerlu wine was one of Halruaas major exports. The wine was sold in Lapaliiya, Chondath, and across the southern shores of the Great Sea.
