A relic was a kind of magic item that had a direct connection with a deity.
As mentioned above, a relic was a magic item with a connection to a deity. This connection was created on crafting the item. It was possible for mortals to create these items, but on Toril, only deities were known to create them. These items were not always artifacts but the term was also applied to artifacts with divine origins.
A relics power could only be used by a follower of the deity the relic was dedicated to. Even these people needed to unlock the relics latent connection to the deity. This was done in one of two ways. First, a divine spellcaster of power could give up a part of his spellcasting to wake up the connection. The second way was for a powerful person to unlock this connection not by temporarily giving up part of spellcasting-abilities but by being a person of true faith, which unlocked the connection.
A relic was a powerful magic item. It also had a lot of symbolic meaning to followers of the deity it was dedicated to. When a person owned one, they were held in high regard by these people. Being blessed by the deity in the eyes of these people, they were viewed as attractive leaders by them.
