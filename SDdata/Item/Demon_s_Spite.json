        "mainbody": "Demons Spite was an enchanted short sword thought to be a relic from the fields of the infinite Blood War.\nDemons Spite had a certain malicious aura about it, and it inspired a twinge of its ill-nature in anyone who even dared to gaze at the weapon. The sword possessed a +1 enchantment and had a good chance of infecting its targets with demon fever. The magics held within the sword made it only usable by creatures that followed the path of evil and destruction.\nDemons Spite was created alongside its sister blade, the Devils Guile, and apart from that, little else was known about both swords. Some believed that the short sword was forged in the Abyss, but it was likely mere speculation, based on the Demons Spites malicious magics. For a long time, the weapon was considered just a legend until it resurfaced in Westgate in the hands of the citys ruling merchant council member. The sword had spent a couple of years with the councilman until a well-publicized burglary. Subsequently, Demons Spite occasionally appeared in local rumors, claiming its use by Westgates criminal underbelly.\nCirca the , both swords were wielded by Rinara of Westgate, an ex-member of the Night Masks. She used the magic weapons in her attempts to rid the guild of the influence of the vampires who took over the organization several years prior."
