A ceremonial kris was an enchanted Rashemi dagger, found in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
The hilt of a ceremonial kris was made out of black metal and encrusted with a big purple gemstone in its center. The blade was a typical snaking shape of a kris, and it was made out of a bright green material.
