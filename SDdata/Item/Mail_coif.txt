A '''mail coif''', also known as a '''chain coif''' or simply a '''coif''', was a padded chainmail hood that usually came either with or built into [[chainmail]] or some other form of mail-based [[armor]].

==Description==
The mail coif was snugly draped over the neck, shoulders, and head of the wearer, leaving only the face exposed. The protection it offered wasn't substantial, especially against impact weapons, and so it was typically worn beneath some form of [[helmet]], such as the [[great helm]] worn by many [[knight]]s.

==Notable Users==
* The [[devil]]s known as [[merregon]]s often wore mail hoods alongside [[studded leather armor]].<ref>
* Some adventuring [[Sunite]] [[cleric]]s wore mail hoods alongside chainmail.<ref>
