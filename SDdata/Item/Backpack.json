These included canvas sacks with shoulder straps and woven baskets with a lid and shoulder straps, though the most preferred type of backpack among travelers was the leather backpack.\nLeather backpacks had multiple pockets, on either side and a large one in the back, which could all have their contents secured by a top flap with a tie. They typically had wide, padded straps in the front so they could be carried on the shoulders and leave the hands free. In addition, some leather backpacks were waterproof.\nBeyond the standard backpacks sold by most merchants, some were known to commission experienced tailors or leatherworkers to construct specially made backpacks.\n* In the city of Ravens Bluff, backpacks of all sizes could be found for sale at Tyms Supple Leather Shoppe.\nBackpacks dated as far back as the time of Netheril, where they first became available in .\n* Hewards handy haversack\n* Rucksack\n* Dorlas\n* Gershom\n* Jaqon\n* Larala Dumian\n* Martine carried a wicker basket type of backpack.\n* Backpacks made of wicker were common among inhabitants of the Malatran Plateau."
