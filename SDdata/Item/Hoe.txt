A hoe was a common digging tool and farming implement found in Faer√ªn.
A hoe was essentially a shovel-like metal blade fixed perpendicular to the end of a long pole.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered hoes with  hardwood handles and iron heads for 3 gp, and steel-headed ones for clay-heavy soil for 5 gp.
