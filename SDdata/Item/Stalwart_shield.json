        "Powers": "''Stalwart shields'' offered ''+2'' enchantment to the user's defenses as well as improved their fortitude.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], one of the ''stalwart shields'' could be found dangling off the arm of a shambling [[ghast]], one of the many warriors who died in the [[Weeping War]] but returned to haunt the ruins of the City of Song. This ghast was still living in the dwarven forge it used in life, outside of the once grand keep of the House of Gems."
