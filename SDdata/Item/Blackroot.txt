Blackroot was an herb that could be distilled to create a poison used in the Underdark. 
The herb caused paralyzation. One could become immune to the poison by ingesting small quantities of it over a long period of time.
Blackroot could be distilled into notoriously thick alcoholic blackroot beer. One tankard of it was considered to be almost a full meal.
