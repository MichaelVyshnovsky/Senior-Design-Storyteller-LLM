'''Blackroot''' was an herb that could be distilled to create a poison used in the [[Underdark]]. 

==Description==
The herb caused paralyzation. One could become immune to the poison by ingesting small quantities of it over a long period of time.

Blackroot could be distilled into notoriously thick alcoholic [[blackroot beer]]. One tankard of it was considered to be almost a full meal.
