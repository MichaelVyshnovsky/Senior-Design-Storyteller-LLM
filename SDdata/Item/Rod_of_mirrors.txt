A '''''rod of mirrors''''',{{Cite dragon/102/Nine Wands of Wonder|30}} was a [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[rod]] that protected against gazes and illusions and granted the power of true sight.

==Powers==
It gave the holder the ability to make an insubstantial round mirror at its top end, {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, which lasted for eleven minutes, once a day. When the holder looked through the back of the mirror, they could see what lay beyond as with the [[spell]] ''[[true seeing]]''. Allowing them to see through ''[[shapechange]]d'' disguises, making them immune to [[illusion]] magic, and perceive things that were invisible.

The spells ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'', and ''[[prismatic wall]]'' would all be reflected by it. While the spells ''[[alter reality]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[wish]]'' could destroy the mirror.

The earliest versions of these rods were only usable by [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s, [[illusionist]]s, and [[magic-user]]s.

==History==
The first of these rods was created by the [[archmage]] [[Glendar]], who conceived of it as a means of protecting [[adventurer]]s from the [[basilisk]]s and [[medusa]]e he despised so much. Glendar made twenty of these rods and after his demise the knowledge of how to create them was lost for quite some time.

==Creation==
Crafting such a rod required the spells ''[[obscuring mist]]'' and ''true seeing''. Each was worth around 40,000 [[gold piece]]s around [[1372 DR]].
