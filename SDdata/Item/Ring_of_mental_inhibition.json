        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of mental inhibition''''' were simple [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s that were created sometime long before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The [[gemstone]] inlaid in the ring's band displayed swirling metallic patterns that could leave an observed dizzy and lightheaded. This effect enhanced the wearer's [[spell]]s, making targets who failed to resist spell effects feel mental fatigue for twelve seconds, making them vulnerable to spells and effects that affected their mental capacities.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''ring of mental inhibition'' could be found in a locked chest among spoils and ruins of the battlefield on the outskirts of the town of [[Reithwin]], left behind from the final battle between the [[Harper]] forces and the cultists of General [[Ketheric Thorm]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR."
