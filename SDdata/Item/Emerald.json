        "mainbody": "Emerald was a brilliant green variety of beryl found in the Realms. These gems were notoriously fragile and needed to be protected from impacts and drastic temperature changes.\nEmerald cleaved easily along orthogonal lines, making rectangular cuts (the \"emerald\" cut, known as a modified step cut in lapidary parlance) the most common form for this jewel. This included table facet (square) and baguette (long rectangular) cuts. Emerald came in many shades, but only the most transparent brilliant green shade merited the highest prices. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp. Emeralds with weak or tainted coloring were classified as gem stones with base value of 1,000 gp. Emeralds in the post-Second Sundering years declined in value to where even the most desired shades were given a base value of 1,000 gp.\nleft|thumb|200px|Faceted emerald, oval cut\nEmeralds were associated with health, and so were used in creating and decorating magical devices which improved health and healing,According to Elminster, \"waterclock\" was shortened from the phrase \"the turning of the waterclocks\", meaning 2 pm in the afternoon.

The stones would crack or break in the immediate presence of perfidy. Kings were known to wear rings carved out of emerald when attending important meetings, parleys, and critical negotiations.\nthumb|A raw emerald.\nAncient gem magic associated emeralds with gates and other gating powers, which was the source of emerald golems ability to create shimmering green teleportation circles.\nEmeralds were considered prized gems among the drow.\nthumb|A polished emerald.\n* Curna emeralds, mined from the Curna Mountains in the Shining Lands, were said to glow with an internal light.\n* The Wyvern Crown of Cormyr was studded with jewels, including emeralds.\n* The lesser deity Iyachtu Xvim was known to occasionally send emeralds to show favor or inspire his followers.\n* Members of the knightly order, the Keepers of the Mystic Flame, were awarded for bringing to justice beings that posed a magical threat to Ravens Bluff."
