'''''Spirit essence''''' was a potent ''[[heal]]ing'' [[potion]] encountered in [[north Faerûn]], [[Icewind Dale]], and the [[Spine of the World]].

==Powers==
''Spirit essence'' concoctions were considered valuable by many. They were created in the far north of [[Faerûn]] by capturing and distilling spirits of [[troll]]s. The process of creation of these potions was so complex that only the most experienced and powerful [[necromancer]]s and [[enchanter]]s dared to attempt it. If brewed correctly, this potion healed even the most severe wounds, instantly regenerating bones and tissues.
