'''Vilksmaarg''' was an [[herb]]ed [[goat]] [[cheese]] made in [[Vilkstead]].

==Description==
Vilksmaarg was pungent and salty, and was popular in taverns along the [[Sword Coast]].

Despite the success of Vilksmaarg and pickled fish as the village's main exports, the ransom paid by Vilkstead to [[Trisk]] to avoid conquest and slavery to [[Slarkrethel]] prevented the villagers from ever escaping poverty.
