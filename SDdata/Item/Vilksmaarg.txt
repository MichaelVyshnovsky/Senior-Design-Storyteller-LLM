Vilksmaarg was an herbed goat cheese made in Vilkstead.
Vilksmaarg was pungent and salty, and was popular in taverns along the Sword Coast.
Despite the success of Vilksmaarg and pickled fish as the villages main exports, the ransom paid by Vilkstead to Trisk to avoid conquest and slavery to Slarkrethel prevented the villagers from ever escaping poverty.
