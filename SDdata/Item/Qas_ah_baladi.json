        "mainbody": "The qasah baladi () was a large Zakharan kettle drum.\nThese drums were crafted from fire-hardened clay. Tough hides were usually used to cover their heads, though sometimes extremely thin metal was used. The large size of the qasah baladi made it inconvenient to transport.\nQasah baladi were used by mamluks throughout the Free Cities of Zakhara and often saw use in Hiyal and Huzuz when important announcements were needed."
