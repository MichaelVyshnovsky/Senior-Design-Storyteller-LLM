'''Hunting traps''' were items sometimes used by [[ranger]]s or woodsmen throughout the wilds of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Common hunting traps were shaped like small [[cage]]s and could capture a variety of animals live. Lethal hunting traps were baited and consisted of opposing blades that sprung closed to decapitate the target for a swift death.

==History==
Hunting traps were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', where the price was based upon the trap's size. Traps for [[rabbit]]s sold for 4 [[gold piece]]s, traps for [[boar]] for 7 gp, and traps for [[bear]]s for 12 gp. The lethal variety of a hunting trap, which was effective against any animal, sold for 10 gp.
