        "mainbody": "he underwater boat was an experimental non-magical self-propelled submarine developed by Nadul DaRoni.\nNaduls device was a sealed one-person boat equipped with paddlewheels and a flipper and was slowly propelled by the pilots hand-pedaling. It contained enough air for the pilot to breathe for at least ten or more minutes, depending on how well they controlled their breathing, and a set of releasable sandbags for ballast allowed the vehicle to surface from the depths (so long as it wasnt carrying more than  of passenger). Aside from the possibility of leaks, the vehicle was quite reliable and safe, especially compared to other inventions like the furnace wagon or heartland flier.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered the boat built by Nadul DaRoni."
