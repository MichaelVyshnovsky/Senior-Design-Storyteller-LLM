        "mainbody": "A '''tindertwig''' was an [[alchemical]] tool used to easily light fires.",
        "Description": "It was a tiny wooden stick with an alchemical substance applied to one end.",
        "Powers": "When the alchemical substance was struck against something rough, it ignited automatically, much quicker than a [[flint and steel]], let alone with a [[magnifying glass]], and without additional tinder. They made lighting [[torch]]es and other fires easier and faster.",
        "Creation": "Related to [[alchemist's fire]] and [[smokestick]]s, tindertwigs required skill in alchemy and spellcasting to make.",
        "Availability": "Tindertwigs were worth 1 [[gp]] each. They were sold among various adventuring supplies, such as by [[Undermountain]] merchant [[Malvar]] around [[1375 DR]].<ref>",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Cogol]] and [[Harrik]], two [[ranger]] followers of [[Malar]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], tied tindertwigs to their smokesticks for ready ignition.<ref>{{Cite web/Fang, Beak, and Claw|4,5}}\n\nFive tindertwigs were also part of the equipment of a [[Zhentarim]] acolyte of [[Bane]] that same year.<ref>\n\n[[Gyudd]] of [[Gyudd's Distillery]] in [[Skullport]] kept ten of them as part of his equipment in 1375 DR.<ref>",
        "History": "Five tindertwigs and a vial of alchemist's fire were found behind some [[deathsbreath mushroom]]s in [[Hekkut|Hekkut the Molted]]'s bandit base in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in 1372; it's unknown why they were there.<ref> \n\nA hundred tindertwigs were part of a cargo of supplies sent from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Swordhold]] in 1372 DR.<ref>"
