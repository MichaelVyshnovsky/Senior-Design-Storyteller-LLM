'''''Ghost-touched bottles''''' were [[enchanted]] containers of translucent and almost invisible glass that appeared [[ghost]]ly. Bottle stoppers appeared melded into the glass, containing misty liquid inside.

{{quote|''That damned [[priest]], I knew it was worthless! Hhrmm... well, thank ye for yer efforts, but I'd rather such a thing be kept far from me. I'd sooner keep anything touched by spirits away from me, I would.''|[[Cahl-Hyred]]}}

==Powers==
The magic was not held within the liquid but in the bottle's glass itself. These bottles were ensorcelled with the ''ghost-touched'' enchantment that allowed the containers to contain small portions of the [[Ethereal plane]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a ''ghost-touched bottle'' was left with Cahl-Hyred, the innkeeper of the [[Weeping Widow Inn]] in [[Targos]] by a [[cleric]] of [[Myrkul]] named [[Koluhm Bonecutter]]. Cahl-Hyred's superstition kept him from using or selling the bottle, and instead, he passed it along to the [[goblin slayers of Targos]]. Some said that later, the mercenaries were able to free a tortured ghost, [[Veira]] of the Weeping Widow Inn, and as the reward, she left them a single tear, caught within the bottle, suspended with the ''ghost-touched'' enchantment. They possibly used the tear to create the ''[[Sorrow's Tear]]'' magic [[dagger]].
