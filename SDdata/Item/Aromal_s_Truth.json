        "mainbody": "'''''Aromal's Truth''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[rapier]] that once belonged to the man named [[Aromal]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "This weapon possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment was made its attacks devastating and guided the wielder's arm toward the target. Additionally, its magics specifically were useful in dealing with [[human]] enemies, dramatically improving the wielder's defense. ''Aromal's Truth'' also gave the wielder the skill of improved evasion and granted the effects of the ''[[freedom of movement]]'' spell as long as they held the raider.",
        "History": "Aromal lived sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}} and was known for his sharp tongue rather than his sharp sword. He could easily charm the wealthy out of their money with a story and was accompanied by several fellow conmen nearly as talented as Aromal. He was a terrible fighter, however, and feared his luck would run out one day. It was uncannily fortuitous that one day Aromal \"discovered\" the rapier that could help him in this.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the weapon fell into he hands of [[Mother Feodorra]], a charm and magic item peddler from the [[Rashemi]] city of [[Mulsantir]]."
