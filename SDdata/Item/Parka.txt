'''Parkas''' was clothing used to keep warm in cold climates.

==Description==
A parka was a practical garment that consisted of a one-piece jacket and hood designed to be slipped over the head like a sweater. It extended just below the waist for optimal coverage. The interior was lined with [[seal]] skin, providing insulation, while the outer layer was made of fur. The hood had a rounded shape and hung loosely over the head without covering the face intentionally. This design prevented excessive frost formation where the fur met the flesh. Although a lightly powdered frost occasionally formed on an uncovered face, it was easily brushed away. Conversely, completely covering the face lead to the formation of a layer of hard ice.

A parka's sleeves were long and wide, allowing the wearer to draw cold hands inside and warm them against the chest. This feature provided a practical solution for warming chilly hands in cold weather conditions.

The thick hide of a [[krotter]] could be used to craft parkas.

==Availability==
* Parkas were an essential item for the [[Iulutiun]]s of the [[Great Glacier]]. Iulutiun parkas were made from [[caribou]] or seal skin, while Nakulutiun parkas were made from the fur and skin from [[bear]]s, [[foxes]] and [[wolves]].
