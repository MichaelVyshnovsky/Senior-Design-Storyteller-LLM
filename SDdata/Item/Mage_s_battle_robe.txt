'''''Mage's battle robes''''' and their more powerful versions, '''''greater battle robes''''', were [[wizard]]ly [[robe]]s that were common in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Mage's battle robes'' were enchanted to radiate low purple light at {{SI|32'|'"|long=yes}} distance. The magics that were weaved into these robes improved the wearer's concentration and spellcraft while granting increased magic resistance.

==History==
''Mage's battle robes'' were create by an obscure yet powerful [[wizard]], [[Klaphen Fortier]]. Klaphen was tired of hearing about the greatness of [[archwizard]]s like [[Elminster Aumar]] or [[Khelben Arunsun]], and powerful arcane organizations such as the infamous [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. His creation aimed at bolstering young spellcasters' abilities who were willing to challenge more experienced wizards and make a name for themselves. It was widely rumored that Klaphen Fortier died in his tower when an unlikely accident rained fifty-six ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' with a score of ''[[Meteor swarm|meteors]]'' on his lair.

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''battle robes'' were coming across the Sword Coast and could be encountered in many cities including [[Neverwinter]].
