        "mainbody": "'''Garras' Keen Sight''' was a unique magic [[ring]], etched with intricate elven filagree, that belonged to [[elven]] archer [[Garras]] in the days of [[Myth Drannor]]'s glory.",
        "Powers": "''Garras' Keen Sight'' possessed powerful enchantments, especially helpful to archers. The wearer of the ring was given uncanny power to hit any target with a bow, increased the wearer's dexterity, and the wearer could cast the ''[[cat's grace]]'' spell once a day.",
        "History": "Before the [[Weeping War]], the ''Keen Sight'' ring was used by the archer-defender of Myth Drannor Garras, aiding his skills and career. After his death in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]], the ring came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, ''the Great Stone Head'', found in the [[Nightingale Court]] of the ruined Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the ''[[Eidolon|eidolons]]'', small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument, dispensed one of the powerful magic rings. One of those rings was ''Garras' Keen Sight''."
