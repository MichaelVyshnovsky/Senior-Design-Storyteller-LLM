The '''''Libram of Rune Magics''''' was a [[rune magic]] [[spellbook]] of the [[College of Rune Magics]].

==Powers==
This book contained all the rune magic [[spell]]s and [[ritual]]s that were taught by the College of Rune Magics, ''[[ritual of healing]]'', and ''[[ritual of warding with runesticks]]''.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Suzail]] were seeking out the scattered remains of [[Awtawmatawn]] on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]]. As part of this quest they investigated the ruins of the College of Rune Magics and came across this book within a stone box that had been ''[[wizard lock]]ed''. They found it to be exceedingly valuable, though very few people would actually be willing to pay them for it.Through it is not outright stated in the adventure, it's heavily implied that this copy of the spellbook was likely placed here within this box by [[Valmous|Valmous the Shaper]].
