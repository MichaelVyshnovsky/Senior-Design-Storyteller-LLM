        "mainbody": "Elder Root stout was a type of ale brewed in the Running Stag tavern in Berdusk and exported to other places along the Sword Coast.\nElder Root stout was a well-brewed rich and flavorful stout. Its good taste was partially due to the use of soft water from the Running Stags spring.\nElder Root stout was popular in the 1360s DR in Berdusk and brought abundant clientele to the Running Stag, including forest folk, wild elves, druids, and other fey races. By 1372 DR, Elder Root stout was exported to other places on the Sword Coast, including Daggerford, where the stout was a popular staple at the Black Stone Inn."
