I hear sounds around it ... the tramp of lizardy feet, and grumbling voices \"I do not care what we promised,\" the leader says. \"This is strong magic, it must go to Malgi Hi.\" And now the feet tramp on, up stairs of stone and into the light.''|The ''[[Ear of Myth Drannor]]'', when asked about magical weapons.}}",
        "Description": "''Deathspike'' was a strong and thick javelin of somewhat primitive design. It was designed for single-handed or throwing use. Its tip was razor sharp.",
        "Powers": "''Deathspike'' had magical enchantment to its aim. The aptly named ''spear of skewering'' itself was able to deal devastating amounts of damage. In normal use, it tripled the harm done to its target, and in case of a critical hit, it was quintupled.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Deathspike'' was in possession of a tribe of [[lizardfolk]] led by [[Malgi Hi]]. Sometime during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] that year, the lizardfolk of that tribe had a violent stand off with a group of [[orog]]s that were trying to carve themselves some of the territory of the razed city.  The ''spear of skewering'' along with some other valuables was left behind after the conflict in the area known as [[Stillwater Ruins]]."
