        "mainbody": "A wand of steam and vapor was a bi-segmented wand that allowed the wielder to shoot forth a torrent of either steam or vapor from its two ends.\nOne end of a wand of steam and vapor could spout forth a jet of hazardous, super-heated steam. This steam would persist for some time, around three minutes or so, causing further harm to creatures. Creatures of fire would not find themselves injured by it unless they were of the type to be harmed by dampness.\nThe other end of a wand of steam and vapor was made to spurt out a billowing cloud of warm vapors. This latter effect was equivalent to a fog cloud spell, but took up a breadth of , a depth of , and a height of . This cloud would persist for around six minutes or so and remained stationary during that time unless moved by some form of breeze or wind, either mundane or magical in nature. This cloud was harmful to any cold-based creatures.\nEach of these functions required separate charges to unleash.\n* Alaginzeron, a spelljamming pirate-mage.\n* Cedric Cormyr, an accountant for the Night Masks."
