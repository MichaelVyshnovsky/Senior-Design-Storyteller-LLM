        "Powers": "One end of a ''wand of steam and vapor'' could spout forth a jet of hazardous, super-heated steam. This steam would persist for some time, around three minutes or so, causing further harm to creatures. Creatures of [[fire]] would not find themselves injured by it unless they were of the type to be harmed by dampness.\n\nThe other end of a ''wand of steam and vapor'' was made to spurt out a billowing cloud of warm vapors. This latter effect was equivalent to a ''[[fog cloud]]'' [[spell]], but took up a breadth of {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}}, a depth of {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}, and a height of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. This cloud would persist for around six minutes or so and remained stationary during that time unless moved by some form of breeze or wind, either mundane or [[magic]]al in nature. This cloud was harmful to any cold-based creatures.\n\nEach of these functions required separate charges to unleash.",
