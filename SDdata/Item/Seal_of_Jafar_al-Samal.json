        "mainbody": "The '''''Seal of Jafar al-Samal''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] created by the first [[sha'ir]], [[Jafar al-Samal|Jafar the Incomparable]].",
        "Description": "The ''Seal'' was an urn made of [[gold]] that stood three feet (ninety centimeters) tall. It was ornately decorated and capped with a [[silver]] talisman that was inscribed with \"Jafar al-Samal\" and completely sealed with lead. Inside the urn were four [[gen]], one representing each of the four elements, [[Air]], [[Earth (element)|Earth]], [[Fire]], and [[Water]].",
        "Powers": {
            "The Curse": "This relic was not actually cursed, but because of its nature it attracted dangerous attention from many directions. First, all genies became instantly aware whenever any power of the ''Seal'' was invoked (that is, any power other than the ''protection from genies'' effect or the use of sha'ir abilities granted by the ''Seal''). They did not know where the urn was, but that did not stop them from searching for it so they could steal it away from its owner and hide it again. In addition, any genie that was successfully commanded to perform a service immediately hated their taskmaster and would work to bring misfortune and misery down upon them indirectly.\n\nSha'irs coveted this relic and greatly feared anyone who possessed its power. Therefore, any sha'ir that heard the ''Seal'' was out of hiding was very likely to be an enemy of the current owner."
        },
        "History": "Jafar al-Samal was the first person to successfully deal with gen and became the first sha'ir. The lords of the [[dao]], [[djinn]], [[efreet]], and the [[marid]]s became jealous of his growing power and sent armies to invade Zakhara. To defend himself and his people, he created the ''Seal'' which granted all Zakharans control over the genies. This ushered in a golden age of peace and prosperity for the people of Zakhara (at least as far as genies were concerned), but this only lasted until his death. His students fought over the relic and their gen rebelled against the greedy young sha'irs, stole the urn, hid it somewhere on [[Toril]], and set [[Guardian genie|guardians]] and [[Slayer genie|slayers]] to protect it."
