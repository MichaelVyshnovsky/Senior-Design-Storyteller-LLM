        "mainbody": "'''Garden gnomes''',{{Cite dragon/425/Spin a Yarn: The Night Thelva Clovenaxe Flew|43}} or '''stone gnomes''', were ornamental statues of [[gnome]]s meant for decorating gardens. [[Waterdeep]], and [[Loudwater]].",
        "Description": "These ornaments were typically small with pointy hats, and had a tendency to be painted rather garishly.",
        "History": "Sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a Waterdhavian citizen came into the offices of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] to absolve him of a bet he had made at a gambling table to a [[spellcaster]] that he believed to be [[Khelben Arunsun]], despite popular consensus among Waterdhavians being that the [[Blackstaff]] was dead. The man claimed that the victor of the bet demanded he provide one of two impossible things by the next night: either an [[elemental]] of [[chocolate]] syrup or \"a [[mermaid]] [[succubus]] who's [[human]] from the waist down\". If he failed to provide either, the man would be [[polymorph]]ed into either a lawn gnome or a [[myconid]] fountain forced to hold a selection of vegetables. The exasperated magist on staff that day, [[Maerlus|Maerlus the Magnificent]], assured the man that the Watchful Order could provide him a short-term semblance of either in return for the appropriate fees.",

        "Notable Garden Gnomes": "The gardens of the [[Enchanter's Ecstasy]] inn in [[Loudwater]] in the 1360s [[DR]] were \"infested\" with stone gnomes, as part of its cutesy decorations and kitsch d√©cor.\n\nIn the [[Thief's Knot]] hedge maze in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]], there was a stone gnome carved to resemble the Master Thief's most respected rival, a thiefcatcher. Once stern of face beneath a pointy hat, weathering had rendered it more amused than anything. A [[trap]] triggering alarm [[bell]]s was cunningly concealed behind it, and [[Sophraea Carver]] and [[Gustin Bone]] nearly set it off in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}."
