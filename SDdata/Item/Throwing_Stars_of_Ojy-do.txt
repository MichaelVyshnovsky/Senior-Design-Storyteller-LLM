The '''''Throwing Stars of Ojy-do''''' was the name given to a set of five magical stone [[shuriken]] associated with the city of [[Ojy-do]] in [[Koryo]]. They were wielded by the five top warriors of the [[Fangs of Night]] [[ninja]] clan based there around [[1357 DR]].These shuriken were unnamed in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'', and were only called "Throwing Stars of Ojy-do" in ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV]]''. In ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', there were only five of these stars, but ''Encyclopedia Magica'' removes this number.

==Description==
Strangely, these shuriken were carved of stone.

==Powers==
Once thrown, these shuriken never missed their targets. They inflicted greater injury than was typical, and the victim could fall unconscious for a brief time if they could not resist.
