        "Description": "These small tracking devices had a piece shaped like a rose and a clear medallion with the cardinal directions clearly marked.",
        "Powers": "The rose was attached to any solid, nonliving surface, where it would send out a signal for up to {{SI|100|miles|long=yes}}. The medallion could trace the signal like a compass. A tiny arrow would appear on the medallion when traveling in the right direction. A simple command word was need to detach the rose. ''[[Dispel magic]]'', or similar effects made the compass rose inoperable for one day but did not allow someone to remove the rose.",
