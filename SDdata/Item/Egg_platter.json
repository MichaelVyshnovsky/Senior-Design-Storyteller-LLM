        "Description": "The egg platter was a collection of various hard-boiled [[bird]] [[egg]]s, such as [[quail]], [[swiftwing]], [[grouse]], and [[goose]]. The eggs were shelled and served on a bed of mouth-burning hot [[spices]] and dips, ready to be rolled and eaten. The spices used for the dish were notorious for their heat, and it was recommended to have [[wine]] or [[beer]] handy to release the feeling of flames in one's mouth.",
        "History": "The egg platter was served at the Dryad's Dreams in the mid-to-late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The dish was praised by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in one of his published travel guides."
