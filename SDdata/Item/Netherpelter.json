        "mainbody": "etherpelters were a kind of magical Netherese missile weapon similar to a blowgun that worked with magical or mundane ammunition.Despite the reference to a blowgun, it is unclear if the netherpelter actually resembled a blowgun or some other device, and if it was propelled by breath, bowstring, or pure magical force.\nNetherpelters could be loaded with normal darts or pellets, and would massively improve the speed, range, and power of the projectile. Special bespoke pellets were intended to be used with the netherpelter, however, with each type having a powerful magical effect.\n Blackhole\nThe first creature or object struck by the blackhole pellet was trapped indefinitely inside of it. While trapped, they were kept under an effect similar to temporal stasis or imprisonment. The imprisoned target could be freed by use of Chronomancers time stop.\n Blowhole\nThe pellet would impact and pierce into the target as a normal projectile, then expand in size tenfold, violently rupturing the flesh.\n Decay\nThe target struck by the decay pellet would immediately begin to rot, rust, and otherwise decompose over a few minutes. The inexorable doom could be halted by a powerful dispel magic or cure disease spell.\n Firepit\nThe pellet detonated on impact, imitating a powerful Noanars fireball explosion.\n Waterpelt\nThe pellet transformed into a large jet or tentacle of water on being launched, slamming the target with crushing force as if by the punch of a water elemental.\n Windwhip\nThe windwhip pellet would forcibly ground a flying target, as if an air elemental had grabbed it and pulled it down."
