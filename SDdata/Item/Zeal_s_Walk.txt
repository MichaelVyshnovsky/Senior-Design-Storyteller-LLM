The '''''Zeal's Walk''''' was a unique set of [[enchanted]] [[chainmail]] created by a coven of jealous witches.

==Description==
''Zeal's Walk'' managed retain its bright polish even after being buried for some time.

==Powers==
This set of chainmail was ensorcelled to improve the wearer's constitution, fortitude, and grant them ''[[Regenerate|regenerative]]'' magics.

==History==
The ''Zeal's Walk'' was believed to be crafted by the ''[[Newt's Brood]]'' coven. The witches enchanted the chainmail to keep an eye on their lover, [[Tholan the Beautiful]], a [[ranger]] who often traveled far and wide out of the witches' grasp. The stories said that when the ranger met and married a beautiful [[elf|elven]] maid, he hid the enchanted armor in attempts to avoid the ex-lovers' scorn.

Sometime before [[1372 DR]], the armor came into the possessions of a [[kobold]] hero [[Muurg]], even though his adventuring career and life were cut short. By 1372 DR, the ''Zeal's Walk'' was buried and hidden under an unassuming [[moss]]-covered rock in the desolate plot of craggy land known as the [[Lonely Barrens]].
