The Zeals Walk was a unique set of enchanted chainmail created by a coven of jealous witches.
Zeals Walk managed retain its bright polish even after being buried for some time.
This set of chainmail was ensorcelled to improve the wearers constitution, fortitude, and grant them regenerative magics.
The Zeals Walk was believed to be crafted by the Newts Brood coven. The witches enchanted the chainmail to keep an eye on their lover, Tholan the Beautiful, a ranger who often traveled far and wide out of the witches grasp. The stories said that when the ranger met and married a beautiful elven maid, he hid the enchanted armor in attempts to avoid the ex-lovers scorn.
Sometime before 1372 DR, the armor came into the possessions of a kobold hero Muurg, even though his adventuring career and life were cut short. By 1372 DR, the Zeals Walk was buried and hidden under an unassuming moss-covered rock in the desolate plot of craggy land known as the Lonely Barrens.
