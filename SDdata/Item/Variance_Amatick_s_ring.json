        "mainbody": "ariance Amaticks ring was a powerful unnamed magical ring that had the ability to change the form of the wearer with a quasi-real shadowstuff disguise. It was owned for a time by the Shadovar Variance Amatick.\nThe ring appeared as a blackened silver band, set with a deep purple amethyst. It originated from Thultanthar, and was deeply infused with the energy of the Plane of Shadow.\nThe ring could almost perfectly alter ones form using quasi-real illusions made of shadowstuff, creating a disguise that looked and felt real. It could change ones apparent size, race, sex, voice, and clothes, allowing the wearer to easily take on almost any persona.\nThe ring had several limitations, however. The quasi-real form did not change the wearers weight, and the form it produced tended to be slightly more pale than normal. It also did not impart any information to the wearer, so an effective impersonation still required extensive research of the target. Most obvious of all, the ring itself was not subject to its own disguise, and so every form that it produced had the ring visible and unaltered on the wearers hand.\nThe ring was worn by the shade priestess Variance Amatick as she enacted a plan in the , to steal The Leaves of One Night from the heavily defended Fourstaves House in Yhaunn. She used it to manipulate both the temple of Shar and the temple of  Sel√ªne, including presenting herself as a Calishite priestess from the Temple of Old Night, as Keph Thingoleirs friend Jarull Cartcoster, and as the wealthy widow Lady Monstaed.\nAlthough her plans were ultimately successful, Keph forced her to give the ring up to Feena Archwood, who passed it to Strasus Thingoleir for safekeeping and study."
