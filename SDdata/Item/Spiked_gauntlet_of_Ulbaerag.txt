The '''''spiked gauntlet of Ulbaerag''''' was a unique [[magic]] [[gauntlet]] located in [[Waterdeep]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

==Description==
The gauntlet weighed {{SI|1|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
The ''spiked gauntlet of Ulbaerag'' was imbued with the ''[[Wounding (weapon quality)|wounding]]'' [[weapon quality]]. Blood from the victim continued to drip from the gauntlet while they bled from any injuries caused by the item.

==History==
[[Ulbaerag]] used the gauntlet as a symbol of authority within [[Bloodhand Hold]] until the settlement was sacked by [[Nimoar]]. It was recovered centuries later by the [[Shadow Thieves]], who named the [[Citadel of the Bloody Hand]] for the item. Following the Shadow Thieves' banishment from Waterdeep, the gauntlet was lost again though it was believed to be hidden somewhere within the City of Splendors.
