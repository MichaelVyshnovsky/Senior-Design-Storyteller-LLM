A turnback amulet was an elven amulet that turned spells back upon their caster.
Per Symrustar Auglamyr, a turnback amulet could turn spells back upon their caster, but needed to draw blood to function.
The guards of house Auglamyr in Cormanthor were given turnback amulets as of the mid-3 century DR.
