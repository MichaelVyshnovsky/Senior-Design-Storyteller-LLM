'''Winter Wine'''  was a type of wine crafted in the [[North Faerûn|North]]. It was also sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].

==Description==
This purplish wine was made after allowing the grapes to freeze on the vine. Winter Wine was was typically served in small portions with dessert since it was strong and sweet. It also had a slight spicy tone.

Winter wines also had a higher alcoholic content achieved by the wines poured in wide containers in freezing temperatures. The ice that formed was removed, making the drink more concentrated than regular wines.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211017204059/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_101112-09.htm| title = So Saith Ed 2009| accessdate = 10-17-2021| date = 10-17-2021}}
