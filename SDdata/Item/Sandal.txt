'''Sandals''' were a common form of footwear that could be found throughout the ''Realms''.

==Description==
[[File:Sandal-TME.png|thumb|273px|''A single sandal with ankle ties.'']]
This form of footwear typically consisted of a leather sole that was held in place by a series of loops around the wearer's ankle, toes, or the top of their foot. When a sandal lacked an ankle strap the loose sole tended to slap against their wearer's heel or toes when they walked, which made walking quietly difficult without practice.

==History==
In the mid to late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], one could purchase sandals from many of the bazaars in [[Zakhara]] for around 7 to 4 [[copper piece]]s depending upon how good they were at bargaining.<ref>

Around that same time, ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' was the sole exporter of [[Calimshan]]'s unique sandals. They were made of fine grain leather in shades of black, brown, or white and had full [[brass]] buckles.

==Varieties of Sandal==
* '''Geta''': a type of [[Kara-Tur]]an sandal that was elevated by wooden blocks.
* '''Pampootie''': leather sandals that were waterproofed by means of waxy plant fibers.
* '''Zori''': Kara-Turan sandals that were made of either woven straw or wooden blocks. Of the two materials, woven straw was considered the cheapest and easiest to craft.

==Notable Sandals==
* ''[[Boots of speed|Sandals of speed]]'': a variety of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] sandals unique to [[Maztica]] that made the wearer faster. These were typically made and used by [[hishnashaper]]s.
* ''[[boots of striding and leaping|Sandals of striding and leaping]]''
* [[Winged boots|''Winged sandals'']]: a pair of enchanted sandals owned by the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] [[Hermes]] that enabled him to fly.
* '''Zin sandals''': sandals made from the hide of a [[zin]]. These were said to enhance a wearer's ability to climb and move quietly.
