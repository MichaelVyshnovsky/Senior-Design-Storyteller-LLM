'''Crown of silver''' was the Realms name for [[wikipedia:en:psilomelane|psilomelane chalcedony]], a variety of [[chalcedony]] containing many fine bands of black [[wikipedia:en:manganese|manganese]].{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|16}}

==Description==
The black bands of these [[ornamental stones]] took on a brilliant polish alongside the silver chalcedony, so crown of silver was usually sliced for [[wikipedia:en:inlay|inlays]], tumbled smooth, or cut [[wikipedia:en:cabochon|cabochon]]. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

==Powers==
In powdered form, crown of silver had a mundane use in preventing rust on ferrous metals when applied directly. In magic, it was used as a component of the (possibly mythical) ''[[everbright]]'' spell. It could also be used in place of [[iron]] filings in most spells that required them, such as certain ''[[Magic circle against good|protection]]'' spells.

==Reputation==
Crown of silver was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station.

The [[lesser deity]] of the drow [[Vhaeraun]] was known to occasionally send crowns of silver to show his favour or disfavour to his followers.
