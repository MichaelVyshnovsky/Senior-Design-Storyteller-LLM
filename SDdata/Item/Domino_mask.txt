Most domino masks from Westgate were black in color and astonishingly thin pieces of delicate fabric with two oval eye slits. These masks covered the top portion of the wearers face and held in place with a thin braided cord. They were functional and elegant enough to adorn the face of a wealthy masquerade goer.
