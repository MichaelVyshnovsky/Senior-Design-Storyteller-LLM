        "Artistic Shells": "The shells of certain saltwater and freshwater molluscs, as well as some amphibian carapaces were highly valued. This was for their ability to be carved into artistic items such as cameos and [[jewelry]], but rarely used for [[currency]] because prices varied wildly with scarcity, fashion, and geography. Large, unblemished specimens could demand high prices from collectors and craftsmen but flawed pieces were generally worthless. Collectors might have paid more for unusual specimens, but any flaws quickly reduced the price.\n\nParticularly valuable shells included:\n* [[Abalone]]\n* [[Black helmet]]\n* [[Conch]]\n* [[Flame helmet]]\n* [[Green abalone]]\n* [[Horned helmet]]\n* [[Mother of pearl]]\n* [[Nacre]]\n* [[Nautilus]]\n* [[Opal cowrie]]\n* [[Pearl cowrie]]\n* [[Purple star cowrie]]\n* [[Red abalone]]\n* [[Red helmet]]\n* [[Sardonyx helmet]]\n* [[Shambos]] (turtle shell)\n* [[Tiger cowrie]]\n* [[Tortoise shell (material)|Tortoise shell]]\n* [[Trochus]]\n* [[Turbo]]\n* [[Unio]]"
