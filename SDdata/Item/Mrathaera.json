        "mainbody": "'''Mrathaera''', also known as '''thaira''' (\"mrathaera\" was originally an [[elven]] word, and \"thaira\" was an abbreviation used by humans) were lip glosses designed to dye, flavor, or scent the lips. On occasion, mrathaera were created that could grant beneficial effects to their wearer, or impart drug effects to a target upon kissing.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/03-21 - Lip Balms, Dyes, Glosses}}",
        "Description": "Any gloss designed to last one hour or more was made of a waxy \"base\" substance, and one or more active ingredients. The base was made from evergreens, berries, or crushed insects such as [[layedur]]. Active ingredients were boiled mixtures of [[herbs]] and plant saps.\n\nFlavored or scented glosses were especially popular in certain situations:\n* [[Mint]] was mostly used among lovers desiring to please their partners.\n* [[Cinnamon]] was widely used by ladies of the night.\n* [[Parsley]] and similar herbs were used to make the breath sweeter without leaving a strong impression.",
        "Powers": "Some mrathaera were known to have helpful effects such as protecting the lips of the wearer against heat and bitterness, making a kissed creature very excited, or heightening the senses. Such balms were used before going into battle or conducting stealthy missions.\n\nOther balms could create debilitating effects on a kissed creature, such as making them sleepy or dizzy, causing hallucinations, or even actual physical harm. Those products affected the wearer as well as their victims&mdash;to prevent this, [[assassin]]s and [[courtesan (prostitute)|courtesans]] would build up a tolerance beforehand.",
        "History": "While the principles of mrathaera were known by humans, most were only able to create very basic concoctions. Only in [[Rashemen]], in the [[Tashalar]], and in [[Var]] were more complex recipes well-known. Among humans and [[half-elves]], balms were almost exclusively created by herbalists, [[apothecary|apothecaries]], or clergies&mdash;especially [[druid]]s.\n\nAmong [[elves]], recipes were usually passed by female family elders to younger members in a rather secretive fashion.\n\nMany woodland folks such as [[pixie]]s, as well as [[gnome]]s and [[halfling]]s, passed down mrathaera recipes in their family in the same fashion as cooking, physics (that is, medicine), or herb-lore was taught.\n\nHistorically, knowledge of mrathaera tended to spread during wars, being of interest to both healers and ladies of coin following the armies."
