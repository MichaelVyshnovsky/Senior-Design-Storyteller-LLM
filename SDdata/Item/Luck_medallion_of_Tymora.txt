A luck medallion of Tymora was an enchanted medallion with a blessing from the church of Tymora, which granted haven and respite to the user when affected by certain spells.
Luck medallions of Tymora took the form of unadorned, shining gold discs, or shining silver ones.
When a spell of invisibility (or one of its stronger variants) was cast upon such a medallion, it created a sphere within which all people were rendered invisible, inaudible, and impossible to smell or even scry magically. All detecting and tracking spells and methods instead reporting wildly inaccurate and actively misleading results. The radius of the sphere was of . The effect lasted for 24 hours, but stopped early if the medallion was moved or touched by a living being while it was working. At the conclusion of this period, the medallion crumbled to dust.
Two of the gifts received in late  by Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith were silvery luck medallions of Tymora, one from Rathan Thentraver and one from Gorstag. Per Narm Tamaraith, they were instructed in their use briefly by Storm Silverhand. At Delg Ironstars prompting and clarification of its use, they employed one while fleeing Zhentarim pursuit while at Hullack Forest later that year. Rather than crumble into dust, the medallion began to melt as its effect ended, presumably as a result of proximity to Shandrils spellfire as she practiced it.
