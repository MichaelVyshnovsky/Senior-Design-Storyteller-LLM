        "mainbody": "The Sunphelm of Shaundaular was jeweled crown that has at one point been the symbol for the rulership of the kingdoms of Ashanath, Eltabranar and Arkaia.\nThe Sunphelm was a simple circlet crafted of silver with golden runes. The crest of the crown had seven spikes, the peaks of which were inlaid with beljurils that would glimmer with light, similar to the spell holy star. The front of the sunphelm had three kings tears dangling from silver chains. Each of these exotic jewels held a vision from centuries before\n*A northern view from the arch in Shandaular, showing the city c.\n*An opposite view from the same location showing the southern half of the city c.200 DR\n*A view of Arkatuil and the bay of Dancing Dolphins c.750 DR\nIn addition to the holy star light effect given off by the Sunphelms beljurils, it also contained contingent restorative magic. It would cast heal upon the wearer if they were about to die from injury, or energy drain.\nThe origins of the sunphelm were unknown and it was originally discovered by the wizard Shan the Golden while working for the gold dwarves of the Great Rift. It was found in a crypt beneath the Akanamere, shortly before the Orcgate opened. Shan wore the crown from the time she lead the Nars mercenaries, through her reign as queen of Ashanath and unto her death. It passed down for generations as her family ruled the kingdom from the city of Shandaular. It was during the era of Arkaius the archmage that the Sunphelm of Shaundaular earned its name.\nThe current whereabouts of the regal crown are unknown, but there have been rumors that it was being worn by a matron mother in the Underdark city of Tlindhet."
