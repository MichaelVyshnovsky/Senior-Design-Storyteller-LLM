The '''doubles wheel''' was an experimental and dangerous flying machine developed by [[Nadul DaRoni]] in his pursuit of purely mechanical flight.
{{Quote
|I am fishing on the lake by my house when I see two [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] flying with tails joined. Then two more, these with one on top of the other. So I watched and saw how they all liked to fly that way; I thought I should make a machine that would let two people fly together.
|''Nadul DaRoni, inventor''

==Usage==
Inspired by the movement of dragonflies, Nadul further developed the [[air screw]] to use the muscle power of two people. An initial design used the same basic design as the air screw, but the stresses of two people using it shattered the device. The next design used a large stepped wheel that was connected to two pairs of huge flapping wings, with the crew securely tied down and seated opposite each other on each end of the wheel. To operate, the heavier and stronger person stepped up and pulled down on the wheel to push the wings down, and the other repeated the motion on their side to reverse the movement and complete one full flap of the wings. Between the two of them working constantly, the device was able to lift up and fly forwards without steering, and was somewhat less likely to immediately crash than the air screw.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered the doubles wheel built by Nadul DaRoni, valued at 95 [[gp]]. He proposed that, with a pair of hard workers, the device could fly well.
