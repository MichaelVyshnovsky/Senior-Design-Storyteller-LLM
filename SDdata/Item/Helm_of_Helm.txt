The '''''Helm of Helm''''' was a holy text of the [[church of Helm]] that took the unusual form of a heavy metallic [[Helmet|war-helm]] instead of an actual [[book]].

==Description==
This divine [[relic]] was appeared as a simple visored metallic helmet without heraldry, mantling or decorations. Its only notable quality was the word ''Surgar'' engraved in [[Common]] on the inside of the visor.

==Powers==
[[File:Helm of helm.png|thumb|right|150px]]
The ''Helm'' was impervious to rust. All its other magical properties were dormant until a creature in contact with it uttered the word ''Surgar'', at which point the visor would start glowing with a faint silver radiance.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, the ''Helm'' emitted a burnt smell whenever it was within approximately {{SI|900|yards}} of any [[magic]]al fire.

===Effects on Chaotic creatures===
Any creature of [[Chaotic]] alignment which touched or wore the helmet suffered painful burns, as if under the effects of a [[heat metal]] spell.

===Effects on Lawful creatures===
The ''Helm'' had different effects on creatures of [[Lawful]] alignment which wore it, depending of whether they worshiped [[Helm]] or not.

Creatures that didn't worshiped the deity would hear a very faint voice while wearing the item. If those creatures were of [[Lawful Neutral]] alignment, they would hear the name of the deity echoing grandly in their mind instead.

===Effects on the faithful===
Followers of Helm which wore the ''Helm'' and spoke the activation word would see the spells it offered displayed one by one inside the visor, in alphabetical order and in ascending level. The user could also bring a specific spell to view instantly by speaking its name aloud. While the ''Helm'' was a good way for faithful to learn new spells, wearing it prevented most spellcasting as it reduced the caster's vision and made it harder to concentrate.

If the ''Helm'' was worn by a formal [[priest]] of Helm, it removed the wearer's need for sleep, and made them immune to exhaustion and weariness. It also protected the wearer against all [[charm]] and [[enchantment]] spells, and greatly empowered any [[Guardian sphere|guardian]] or [[Protection sphere|protection]] spells they cast.

==Contents==
As a [[spellbook]], the ''Helm'' contained information on a variety of protection spells such as [[anti-vermin barrier]] or [[protection from evil]]. It also contained prayers detailing spells meant to support allies, such as [[chant]] or [[cure serious wounds]], and offensive spells such as [[fist of faith]] or [[flame strike]]. Finally, it gave access to several spells specific to the Helmite faith, such as [[mace of Odo]], [[seeking sword]], or [[sentry of Helm]].

The last known in-depth examination of the ''Helm'' revealed that it provided prayers covering over 40 spells to the faithful.

==History==
The ''Helm'' was found by the [[helmite]] cleric [[Garshond]] in the {{YearlinkName|1264}} while defending the town of [[Iriaebor]] against an army of [[goblinoid]]s. It was said that the ''Helm'' rose out of a battlefield bog and presented itself to the cleric. It was unclear whether Helm created the item at that moment, or took it from the bones of an older champion of his faith laying under the waters of the bog. Garshond kept the ''Helm'' in his possession until his death in the {{YearlinkName|1268}}, at which point the relic disappeared for a time.

The ''Helm'' resurfaced in [[Westgate]] during the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, where it was used by the [[church of Shar]] as a bait to assassinate priests of opposing clergies. Days of battle plagued the town after that, involving several bands of [[adventurer]]s and [[mercenaries]], hordes of summoned monsters, faithfuls of [[Shar]] and [[Helm]], as well as some [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. Those events ultimately led to the [[Helmite]] priest [[Carath]] acquiring the ''Helm'' in the {{YearlinkName|1313}}. It was said that Carath added more spells to the ''Helm'' under the guidance of his deity, and used it until his death in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}.

The last known owner of the ''Helm'' was a Helmite priest known as [[Rolor]], who used it to fight [[Zhentarim]] forces near [[Darkhold]] before disappearing in the [[Tunlands]].
