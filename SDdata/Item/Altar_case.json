        "mainbody": "Altar cases were a religious item in the Realms carried by clerics who used them as small portable altars.\nAn altar case was a wooden and stone box that opened to reveal a small altar. There was enough space within the case to carry several other small holy items.\nThese items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 15 gold pieces for one made from spruce and 40 gold pieces for one of granite.\n* Altar cases were favored by clerics and priests."
