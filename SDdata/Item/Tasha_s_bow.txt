'''''Tasha's bow''''' was a magic [[longbow]] that belonged to a famous [[elf]] hunter [[Tasha Moonsong]].

==Powers==
''Tasha's bow'' was a large weapon that allowed the owner to increase the shot's damage by applying their strength to have the bow overstrung. Additionally, the bow possessed a magical +1 enhancement and delt even more extra damage to [[Scalykind|reptilian]] enemies.

==History==
The bow belonged to the [[elf]] hunter [[Tasha Moonsong]] sometime before [[1372 DR]]. The bow has been her trusty companion on a multitude of hunting expeditions. During one of those adventures, ''Tasha's bow'' helped her to kill a [[roc]] with a barrage of bullseye shots from 150 ft. away. During another adventure, the bow helped Tasha to hunt [[basilisk]] while blindfolded.

The last known location of ''Tasha's bow'' was in the Lizard Marsh outside of [[Daggerford]], when Tasha disappeared while hunting [[dinosaur]]s.
