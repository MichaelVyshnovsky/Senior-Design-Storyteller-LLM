A '''teleport tome''' was a type of [[spellbook]] used in the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

Used by travelers and [[bloodforge]] mages, it let the user [[teleport]] to a known, safe location. It was reusable, but required a small expenditure of [[mana]].
