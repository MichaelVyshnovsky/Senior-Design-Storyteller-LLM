        "mainbody": "The '''''rod of reincarnation''''', also known as '''''Malice's rod of reincarnation''''', was a unique magic [[wand|rod]] that once belonged to the infamous [[Matron mother|Matron Mother]] of [[House Do'Urden]], [[Malice Do'Urden]].",
        "Description": "The ''rod of reincarnation'' appeared to be a metallic rod, topped with seemingly [[gold]]en winged [[scarab]], reminiscent of [[Mulhorand]]i designs. The scarab's wings were unfolded and supported a small [[spider]] encased within a red [[gem]]stone.",
        "Powers": "The ''rod of reincarnation'' possessed the same powers as a ''[[rod of resurrection]]'' with one significant difference. If the ''rod of reincarnation'' was be used to successfully strike a creature, the target of the attack could instantly be destroyed and reincarnated as a completely separate new being. All the abilities, attributes, class, personality, and race of the new being were determined at random. This ability could be used to resurrect a perished creature with all the random effects of them being brought back to life. The power levels of the reborn creature were the same as the initial target's. This strange ability could only be used twice.",
        "History": "This ''rod of reincarnation'' was gifted to Matron Mother Malice during the time when House Do'Urden stood high in the favor of [[Lolth]], the Queen of Spiders and patron goddess of [[Menzoberranzan]]. Due to the scepter's power, Matron Mother kept its existence a secret, planning on using it during times of strife. After her death in [[1339 DR]] at the hands of her own daughter, the knowledge of its whereabouts was lost.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Matron Mother Malice Do'Urden until 1339 DR."
