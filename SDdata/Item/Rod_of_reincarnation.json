        "mainbody": "The rod of reincarnation, also known as Malices rod of reincarnation, was a unique magic rod that once belonged to the infamous Matron Mother of House DoUrden, Malice DoUrden.\nThe rod of reincarnation appeared to be a metallic rod, topped with seemingly golden winged scarab, reminiscent of Mulhorandi designs. The scarabs wings were unfolded and supported a small spider encased within a red gemstone.\nThe rod of reincarnation possessed the same powers as a rod of resurrection with one significant difference. If the rod of reincarnation was be used to successfully strike a creature, the target of the attack could instantly be destroyed and reincarnated as a completely separate new being. All the abilities, attributes, class, personality, and race of the new being were determined at random. This ability could be used to resurrect a perished creature with all the random effects of them being brought back to life. The power levels of the reborn creature were the same as the initial targets. This strange ability could only be used twice.\nThis rod of reincarnation was gifted to Matron Mother Malice during the time when House DoUrden stood high in the favor of Lolth, the Queen of Spiders and patron goddess of Menzoberranzan. Due to the scepters power, Matron Mother kept its existence a secret, planning on using it during times of strife. After her death in 1339 DR at the hands of her own daughter, the knowledge of its whereabouts was lost.\n* Matron Mother Malice DoUrden until 1339 DR."
