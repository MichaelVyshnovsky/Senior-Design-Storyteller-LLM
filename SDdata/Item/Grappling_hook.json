        "mainbody": "Grappling hooks were a type of tool used to secure ropes for the purpose of climbing.\nTheir rigid hooks were typically made of either two, three, or four welded together cast iron bars. Though hooks that could be folded flat were known to exist, they tended to cost roughly twice as much as a standard hook.\nHooks were designed to be thrown and secured on protrusions, thereby allowing rope to support a climbers weight.\nThe intended use for grappling hooks was simply to make climbing easier and safer. However, thieves took advantage of the tool and over time it became considered a crucial tool in their line of work.\nA fold-able, single-pronged version of the grappling hook was included in a rope set sold by Auroras Emporium in its \"Thieves Corner\" assortment.\nOne type of grappling hook was the griffons claw, which possessed a magically strong grasp.\n* In Athkatla, one could find grappling hooks for sale at the market Waukeens Promenade.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* In Zhentil Keep, one could find grappling hooks for sale at Litas Equipment.Ruins of Zhentil Keep states that everything from the Arms and Equipment Guide, except for arms and armor, can be purchased at Litas Equipment.\n* Branislav Semyon, one of many thieves known to utilize grappling hooks.\n* Kestrel, a thief and the de facto leader of the Veiled Ones who opposed the Cult of the Dragon in 1369 DR.\n* Jermlaines were often known to fight with makeshift grappling hooks."
