'''Red Wyrm Ale''' was a type of [[ale]] concoction found in the fishing town of [[Tulmene]] on the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
Red Wyrm Ale was considered to be the cheapest swirl served at [[the Fast Sails]] tavern in Tulmene. The drink was a mix of several cheap local brews. Despite its price and ingredients, the drink was smooth to taste and pleasant.
