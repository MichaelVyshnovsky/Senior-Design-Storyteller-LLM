'''''Rods of the ghost''''' were [[enchanted]] [[rod]]s that could turn their wielder ethereal for a short period of time.

==Powers==
These rods of defensive magics allowed the wielder to cast ''[[ghostly visage]]'', making them ethereal, hard to spot, hard to strike, and immune to certain weak offensive [[spell]]s and [[cantrip]]s. An average ''rod of the ghost'' held three charges and could be used once per day.

==History==
''Rods of the ghost'' gained popularity in the [[Sword Coast]] region in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. One such rod of ancient making could be found in [[Telarthir's tomb]] of the [[Brush of Barbs]] in [[1372 DR]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a magical curio store â€“ [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] of [[Westgate]], was in possession of one of these rods.
