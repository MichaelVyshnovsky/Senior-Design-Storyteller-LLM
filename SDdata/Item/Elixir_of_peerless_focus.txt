Elixir of peerless focus were magic potions that fortified the imbibers mind.
When consumed, elixirs of peerless focus provided a valuable boon to spellcasters by steeling their minds and improving their focus and concentration on spells. As a side effect, the potion made it harder for the imbiber to fall victim to the charm spell and immune to sleeping magics and poisons. The elixirs effects lasted until the imbiber rested for at least eight consecutive hours.
Elixir of peerless focus could be brewed using a sublimate of belladonna and special type of ash.
