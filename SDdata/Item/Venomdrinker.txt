The '''''Venomdrinker''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] that once belonged to a [[yuan-ti]] [[Zehirite]] cultist who worked under [[Sheydann Zinn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Like other weapons of the Forktongue Cultists, the ''Venomdrinker'' was enchanted with a ''[[blessing]]'' of the dark god [[Zehir]]. The wicked-looking weapon oozed deadly [[poison]] as well as darkness and ''[[negative energy]]''. When swung in battle, the ''Venomdrinker'' acted like a ''+1'' enchanted blade and with each successful strike it damaged the opponent with deadly ''negative energy'' and poisoned them.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, yuan-ti who followed an interloper deity [[Zehir]] revealed their sinister intents for the [[Sword Coast]]. The yuan-ti [[House Se'Sehen]] began attacking the operations of [[House Sauringar]] and their [[Mercantile House]] trading organization led by [[Sa'Sani]]. In secrecy, these Forktongue Cultists spread, routing in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] among other places. The swamp cabal was led by a well-disguised [[pureblood]] named Sheydann Zinn. The unique blade called the ''Venomdrinker'' was in the hands of Zinn's cultists.
