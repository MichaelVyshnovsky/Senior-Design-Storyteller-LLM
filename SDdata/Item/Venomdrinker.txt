The Venomdrinker was an enchanted scimitar that once belonged to a yuan-ti Zehirite cultist who worked under Sheydann Zinn in the late 14 century DR.
Like other weapons of the Forktongue Cultists, the Venomdrinker was enchanted with a blessing of the dark god Zehir. The wicked-looking weapon oozed deadly poison as well as darkness and negative energy. When swung in battle, the Venomdrinker acted like a +1 enchanted blade and with each successful strike it damaged the opponent with deadly negative energy and poisoned them.
In the , yuan-ti who followed an interloper deity Zehir revealed their sinister intents for the Sword Coast. The yuan-ti House SeSehen began attacking the operations of House Sauringar and their Mercantile House trading organization led by SaSani. In secrecy, these Forktongue Cultists spread, routing in the Mere of Dead Men among other places. The swamp cabal was led by a well-disguised pureblood named Sheydann Zinn. The unique blade called the Venomdrinker was in the hands of Zinns cultists.
