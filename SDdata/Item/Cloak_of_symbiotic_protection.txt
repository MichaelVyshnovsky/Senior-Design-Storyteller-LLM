A '''''cloak of symbiotic protection''''' was a very rare type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[cloak]] infused with a living, though immobile and seemingly unintelligent, symbiotic substance.

==Powers==
Whoever wore one of these cloaks was impervious to the harmful effects of [[green slime]]s, [[olive slime]]s, [[obliviax]]es, [[Violet fungus|violet fungi]], [[yellow musk creeper]]s, [[yellow mold]], and [[russet mold]]. In addition, the wearer's immune system became stronger in terms of fighting off the hazardous spores of many types of fungi, including [[ascomoid]]s, [[basidirond]]s, and [[myconid]]s.

As a negative consequence of wearing this cloak, the symbiotic life form would drain a small amount of vitality from its user every time it was put on. Alternatively, it would drain a small amount once every two days if worn continuously. The cloak also made its wearer colorblind, though only for the duration of it being worn.

Besides vitality, the symbiotic life form fed upon and neutralized spores and nearly all other forms of microscopic, airborne life. Because of this, wearers had a lower chance of contracting some [[disease]]s.

==History==
What living substance infused these cloaks was and its origins were both completely unknown to scholars. Naturalists and [[alchemist]]s alike had attempted to separate them for study, but every time the substance proved impossible to isolate.
