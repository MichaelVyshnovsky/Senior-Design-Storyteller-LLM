'''Insect repellent''', also known as '''parasite repellent''', was a class of substances designed to protect the user from the bites of [[:Category:Insects|insects]] and [[:Category:Parasites|parasites]].

==Description==
Both natural and [[alchemical]] or otherwise [[magical]] insect repellents existed, and they came in many forms with somewhat different use cases.

===Incense===
Insect-repelling [[incense]] could be used to ward off all normal bugs within a radius of {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}}. When lit, a block of such incense would burn for up to eight hours. Such incense sold for 1 [[silver piece]] per block as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

===Liquids===
Alchemists were said to manufacture a strong smelling liquid that was applied to the skin. It worked to repel normal and smaller insects for up to four hours and could even dissuade [[giant insect]]s or insects under the influence of [[spell]]s from attacking the wearer. Such substances were sold for 5 [[gold piece]]s per dose as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. 

It was said that certain magical fluids could be sprayed to prevent any insect from approaching the user. Containers of such fluids could sell for 1,000 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

===Powders===
Powdered insect repellents were said to be an alchemical substance that warded off any insects in much the same way that similar magical substances might ward off [[lycanthrope]]s or [[undead]], although the effect usually only lasted up to 20 minutes. These were produced from ingredients derived from natural flowers including [[daisy|daisies]] and [[Jasmine (plant)|jasmine]].{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|39}} Such powders sold for 200 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

===Salves===
Insect repelling salves were applied to the skin and generally protected only against normal insects. They tended to be ineffective against giant insects or against angry swarms,{{Cite adventurers league/Bounty in the Bog|10}} or to help prevent the contraction of [[disease]]s from them. 

Nonmagical salves tended to be greasy as a result of being water resistant, and could be either odorless or quite pungent. Such salves were sold in [[vial]]s, [[jar]]s, or [[gourd]]s containing enough for between 3 and 20 days of protection, and sold for 1 gold piece per 20 doses as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

A magical version of insect repelling salve{{Cite dragon/119/"Is There a Doctor In the Forest?"|19}} These magical salves sold for as much as 1,000 gold pieces as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

===Other===
[[Angelica (plant)|Angelicas]] could serve as a mild insect repellent. The juice of [[magasorium]]s{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin/Certificates}} and the oil derived from [[bison-gourd]]s could be utilized as effective insect repellents.

[[Garlic]] juice was said to be a natural insect repellent, although its strong smell made it easy to tell when a user of it was coming. Garlic could also be used to soothe venomous insect bites.{{Cite dragon/82/Wounds and weeds|16}}

[[Chultan dwarves]] were known to cover themselves in grease to ward off insects.

In the [[Othrys]] layer of [[Carceri]], [[stinkweed]] was commonly rubbed on bodies to ward off insects. 

The [[Azuposi]] people of [[Maztica]] used the [[cohosh|black cohosh]] plant as a natural "bugbane".

There also existed a ''[[repel insects]]'' spell that achieved a similar effect as repellent substances.

==History==
Folk in the [[Moonsea]] region made use of an insect repellent that came in the form of a pungent yellow goop. 

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, explorers in [[Chult]] were advised to use insect repellent to avoid contracting [[shivering sickness]]. The market for insect repellent was strictly regulated in [[Port Nyanzaru]]&mdash;the only city in Chult at the time&mdash;with the sale and production of such repellents being controlled by the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Kwayoth√©]]. Both salves and incense could be bought at the city's [[Red Bazaar]].
