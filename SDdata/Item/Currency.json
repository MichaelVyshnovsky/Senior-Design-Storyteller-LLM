        "mainbody": "'''Currency''' referred to the practice of using items with a somewhat universal value, namely precious [[metal]]s, [[gem]]s, and some minerals to determine wealth and in trade for goods and services. The most common forms of currency in everyday transactions among sentient beings of the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]] were coins (or \"pieces\"). Usually, most coins were made of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[copper]]. Less frequently, coins made of [[platinum]], [[electrum]], and even [[iron]] were also found. In all cases, the standard for measuring wealth was the gold piece, even if neither gold nor coins were involved in a transaction.\n\nA standard gold piece (gp) weighed {{SI|0.32|oz|long=yes}}, so 50 coins weighed about {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}.Unfortunately, for both of these statements to be true, a typical gold coin had very little gold in it and was either alloyed with a ''much'' lighter metal, like aluminum, or was made of a gold-clad wooden disk. The density of gold is 19.32 g/cm³ and a pure gold coin of those dimensions would weigh about {{SI|1.7|oz|long=yes}} or over five times the weight of a \"standard\" coin. This suggests that the dimensions of a standard coin should be smaller and thinner.\n\nThe penalty for counterfeiting was death in most places, since cities, kingdoms, and nations relied on the acceptance and trust of their currency.\n\nWhen large sums were involved, it was common for traders to use [[trade bar]]s, which were valued by weight, instead of coins.",
        "Standard Exchange Rates": {
            "As of [[1357 DR]]": "By the [[Year of the Prince]], standard exchange rates were the following:The year [[1357 DR]] corresponds to the \"present\" in p. 6 of the 1st-edition ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]''.\n\n{{Currency table|1 platinum piece|1 [[platinum]] |5 [[gold]]|10 [[electrum]]|100 [[silver]] |1000 [[copper]]}}\n\nIn that time period, silver and electrum trade bars were available in 10, 25 and 50 gp denominations.",
            "As of [[1367 DR]]": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], platinum and gold (and consequently electrum) saw a decrease in value with respect to other metals. Around this time, standard exchange rates across the Realms were:<ref group=\"note\">The year [[1367 DR]] corresponds to the \"present\" in p. 23 of the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]''.\n\n{{Currency table|1 platinum piece|1 platinum |5 gold|10 electrum|50 silver |500 copper}}\n\n[[Platinum]] coins were called tricrowns, plats, or pearls (in particular the Southern versions, which were officially named roldons).\n\nIn this time period, silver and electrum trade bars in the 10, 25 and 50 gp denominations were still available, as well as bars valued in 500 and 1,000 gp. Trade bars from merchants were thin silver bars marked at one end with the value, and the other end had the symbol of the trading institution or coster which created it. An increasing number of these bars bore the mint mark of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Trade bars were always checked by weight.\n\nTrade bars of the [[Iron Throne]] trading group were not honored by other trading organizations because this group was considered disreputable. Broken trade bars had no value, but most merchants would continue to honor the trade bars of defunct institutions.",
            "As of [[1372 DR]]": "By the [[Year of Wild Magic]], the value of platinum increased and electrum pieces fell in disuse, no longer being commonly found as much as other coins.

This time period also saw the appearance of trade bars made of several different metals, including gold (although those were still rare at the time) and [[iron]] (although its value was not standardized outside of [[Mirabar]]). Trade bars were most commonly found in weights of {{SI|1|lb|k}}, {{SI|2|lb|k}}, {{SI|5|lb|k}}, and {{SI|10|lb|k}}. Standard values were the following: a {{SIAdj|1|lb|k}} silver bar was worth 5 gp and a {{SIAdj|1|lb|k}} gold bar was worth 50 gp.",

A one-pound gold trade bar retained its value of 50 gp.",
            "As of [[1489 DR]]": "After the [[Second Sundering]], electrum pieces reappeared and were once again seen in trade. The relative values of other coins had remained unchanged for over a century.

A gold bar weighing {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}} was worth 50 gp; the same weight of copper was worth 5 sp; {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}} of silver was worth 5 gp; and a {{SIAdj|1|lb}} bar of platinum was worth 500 gp.<ref name=PHB5e-p157>"

During this same period, Silverymoon also minted the round \"[[eclipsed moon]]\", rated at 5 unicorns in Silverymoon and 2 unicorns elsewhere.Page 20 of the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition]]'' instead states that a moon is worth 1 gp within the city and 1 ep elsewhere, while the eclipsed moon is worth 5 ep within Silverymoon and 2 ep elsewhere.",
