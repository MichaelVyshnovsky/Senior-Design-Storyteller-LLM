'''Cola nut''' was a species of nuts that grew on the [[Malatran Plateau]] of [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/167/Game Wizards: Understanding Undermountain|88}}

==Description==
On the Malatran Plateau, cola nuts were a valuable trade commodity. The nuts were crushed and brewed in a similar fashion to [[beer]], but removed before the natural fermentation began. This process resulted in a flat refreshing beverage.
