A '''''wand of polymorph''''', also known as a '''''wand of polymorphing''''',

==Powers==
This type of wand held seven charges. At any time, its wielder could expend one of these charges to emit a thin green ray that shot out towards a target person or creature. Unless the target resisted the effect, this beam of energy [[polymorph]]ed them into the form of a another being.

==Notable Wand of Polymorph==
*''Mirynda's wand of polymorping'': this magic wand had a more potent ''polymorphing'' magic imbued into it. ''Mirynda's wand'' had the ability to change the wand's target not just into harmless small critters, but also into rocks, plants, or even monsters. This wand worked at {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}} distance. The effects of this wand were temporary, fading away after 7-12 hours. If the wand's user touched the target with the wand, then there was a great chance that effects of ''polymorphing'' were permanent.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|261|Mirynda's Wand of Polymorping}}
