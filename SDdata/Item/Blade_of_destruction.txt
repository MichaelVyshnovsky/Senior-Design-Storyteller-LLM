''Blade of Destruction'' was a blue tinted heavy two-handed sword that shimmered with magic.

==History==
At some point before [[1369 DR]], while exploring the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], Jelde Asturien found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of [[House Ammath]] in the [[Glim-Gardens]] district and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. In  1369 DR, the vault still contained Jelde's ''blade of destruction'' and a set of ''[[arcane mail]]''.
