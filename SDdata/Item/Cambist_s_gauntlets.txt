'''Cambist's gauntlets''' were pairs of gauntlets that could occasionally empower the wearer's strikes, at the cost of [[currency|coin]]. In the late 14{{th}} century DR, a pair of cambist's gauntlets were part of the [[red dragon]] [[Lostmauth]]'s hoard.

==Powers==
At random, cambist's gauntlets could strengthen an attack made by their wearer. The gauntlets consumed 5 silver pieces every time this power was activated.{{cite web|url=https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/10936423|title=Patch Notes: Version: NW.100.20180611a.6|accessdate=2020-05-31|author=Julia Fredrickson|date=2018-06-25|publisher=[[wikipedia:Perfect World Entertainment|Perfect World Entertainment]]}}
