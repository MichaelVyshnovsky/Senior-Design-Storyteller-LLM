        "mainbody": "Wargongs were broad and heavy gongs made of metal that produced a loud thundering sound.\nWargongs were traditionally made from the battered shields of enemies or large, beaten brass circles. They were popular musical instruments among goblins and dwarves and were commonly played in the Underdark.\nAnother variant of wargong consisted of a large copper disk that could produce a loud sound when struck heavily or a sustained rumble if played with mallets. This variant of wargong was popular in courts and battlefields alike, as they could also be used to transmit signals between outposts across great distances.\nWargongs crafted in Shou Lung were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue but had to be specially ordered."
