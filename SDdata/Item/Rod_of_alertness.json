        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of alertness''''' was a [[magic item]] that helped the wielder pierce [[illusion]]s.",
        "Description": "These [[rod]]s resembled [[footman's mace]]s with eight flanges on their head.",
        "Powers": "When used as a weapon, a ''rod of alertness'' made it slightly easier for the wielder to strike and harm their enemy, while also making them more alert to surprise attacks.\n\nThe rod enabled the wielder to ''[[detect alignment]], [[detect evil|evil]], [[detect good|good]], [[Detect illusion|illusion]], [[Discern lies|lies]], [[detect magic|magic]], and [[detect invisibility|invisibility]]'' when gripped tightly. If planted into the ground, the rod could sense any dangerous creatures within a {{SI|120|ft}} radius. Each flange on the rod's head would emit ''[[light]]'' to a range of {{SI|60|ft}} while protecting the wielder with a ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' in a {{SI|20|ft}} radius. Lastly, the rod could ''[[animate objects|animate]]'' up to 16 objects selected by the wielder that were placed around the rod.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Celedon Kierney]], a [[half-elf]] [[mage]] from the [[Bloodstone Lands]], carried a ''rod of alertness''."
