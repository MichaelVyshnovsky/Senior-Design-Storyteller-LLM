'''Samovars''' were vessels filled with boiling water intended for serving [[tea]].

==Description==
A samovar appeared as an urn-shaped vessel with a spigot. A tube of burning [[charcoal]] kept water stored within at boiling temperature.

While typically crafted out of metals such as [[tin]], some samovars were instead made of [[porcelain]].

Some of these vessels were crafted to accommodate a separate [[teapot]] on top, which would be filled with particularly strong tea meant to be diluted with the samovar's boiling water. In [[Zakhara]], samovars of this kind were sometimes also used to serve [[coffee]].

==Notable Samovars==
A [[marilith-shaped samovar]] was one of several [[madness]]-inducing magical items spread by [[Graz'zt]] during his stay in the [[Deep Wastes]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Malady of Elventree|5}}
