Sulabra was the Realms name for argillite.
Sulabra was a soft, gray stone somewhere in between slate and shale in color and hardness. It easily cleaved in planes and was good for cheap carvings. It was of relatively low value due to its lack of color and durability. A typical price was 7 sp per pound (15.5 sp/kg).
None known.
