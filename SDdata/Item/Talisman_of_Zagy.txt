A '''''talisman of Zagy''''' was an unusual magical item that responded powerfully to the bearer's personal charisma.

==Description==
A ''talisman of Zagy'' had the same appearance as a ''[[stone of controlling earth elementals]]'', looking like an innocuous chunk of polished rock.

==Powers==
A ''talisman of Zagy'' responded to whoever touched it, determining a hostile, neutral, or friendly reaction to their innate charisma.

* A hostile ''talisman'' acted as if it were a ''[[stone of weight]]'', drastically slowing down the bearer when they tried to move quickly. Fortunately, the ''talisman'' was not as hard to get rid of, and destroying it permanently removed it from the bearer.
* A neutral ''talisman'' would simply remain with the bearer for a day or two, then mysteriously disappear.
* A friendly ''talisman'' would cling to the bearer for months or years depending on just how charismatic they were. In this time, it could grant the bearer multiple ''[[wish]]es'', and give off a throbbing warmth whenever the bearer came within 20 feet of a magical or mechanical trap.

Whatever reaction the ''talisman'' had, at the moment of disappearance it would replace itself with a [[diamond]] worth 10,000 [[gp]].

==Notable Owners==
* A gang of [[imp]]s in the [[Vast Swamp]] had a small treasure hoard, including a ''talisman''.
* The [[shadow dragon]] [[Shadowdeath]], who was trapped inside the [[Tower of Ruin]], had a sizable hoard including a ''talisman''.
