'''Yulchass powder''' was a [[drug]]-like substance from [[Chult]] made out of a type of berry only found in deep jungles of that region.

{{quote|''That lemon taste... Your "little something extra" wouldn't have been a purple powder, would it? From Chult?''|[[Belgin Dree]]}}

==Description==
Yulchass powder was purple in color and had a strong distinctive [[lemon]] taste. The powder could be mixed with food safely and stealthily, if the food could mask the lemon taste of the powder, or be enhanced by it.

==Powers==
When consumed, yulchass powder kept the imbiber awake and alert for a day longer than they could stay awake and active otherwise. Unlike other substances or magics that achieved similar effect, the imbiber did not suffer physiological consequences of the lack of sleep, nor succumbed to the stolen sleep later.

Yulchass powder possessed a side-effect that made the person who consumed it involuntarily honest and loose-tongued.

==History==
Sometime in [[1377 DR]], a shady individual [[Belmer Droon]] used yulchass powder on the mercenaries he hired to assassinate [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]], in an attempt to test their loyalty.
