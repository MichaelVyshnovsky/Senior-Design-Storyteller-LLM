        "mainbody": "'''Pipe organs''' were unmovably huge and the most complex and of all [[musical instruments]], consisting of a system of metal tubes, wooden shafts, usually controlled by two sets of keyboards.",
        "Description": {
            "Sound": "[[File:Pipe organ gnome.png|thumb|250x250px|''[[Skoradin Thinskin]] and his scornful-sounding pipe organ of doom.'']]\nPipe organs were considered to be the height of ingenuity and musical art. The instrument's numerous pipes and keyboards allowed for the widest range of sound compared to other instruments and even among their close relative instruments such as [[harpsichord]]s. The pitch varied depending on the pipe's size. Smaller ones produced higher-pitched music and ''vice versa''. Some exceptional pipe organs had pipes so large, their sounds were imperceptible by [[human]]s, and pipes so diminutive that only tiny animals could perceive their music. When the player stroke multiple keyboards at the same time, the organ produced a multitude of chords.",
            "Operation": "The organ player was positioned directly in front of the instrument after setting the stops directing the airflow from bellows to the pipes. In order to operate the ingenious instrument, bellows needed to be pushed through the entire performance. Some pipe organs had a pedal just for that operated by the player, but most, especially the bigger instruments, required at least one assistant."
        },
        "History": "In [[1364 DR]], a [[Harper]] agent [[Danilo Thann]] and the rogue [[elf]] [[Elaith Craulnober]] encountered a strange pipe organ assembled out of [[reed]]s on their way to [[Taskerleigh]]. The strange organ tuned itself to music and caused the surrounding swamp reeds to dance to the melody. The music echoed from the opposite side of the swamp. The music reached a crescendo in a loud and deep blast of sound similar to a [[hunting horn]]. These organs served to alert a tribe of [[bullywug]]s who dwelt in the murky depths of the bog.\n\nSometime after [[1485 DR]], a gargantuan [[coral]] pipe organ belonged to the [[storm giant]]s of [[Malestrom]], the stronghold at the bottom of the [[Trackless Sea]].\n\nDuring the ''[[Descent]]'' of [[1492 DR]], the magnificent [[ivory]]-keyed pipe organ of [[High Hall (Elturel)|Elturel's High Hall]], along with the entire city was transported into [[Avernus]] and back to [[Toril]] after suffering from relentless [[fiend]]ish attacks on the castle.",
        "Notable Pipe Organs": "*''[[Astrolabe of Nimbral]]'', a powerful magical artifact from the island of [[Nimbral]] that resembled a [[printing press]] mixed with a pipe organ that allowed the user to ''[[teleport]]'' the entire building or vehicle where the apparatus was located.\n*''[[Bellows of Milil]]'', a mighty organ that resided within the temple [[Arbalest's House]] in [[Athkatla]].<ref>\n*''[[Heward's Mystical Organ]]'', an organ that had the reputation of a fabled magical artifact. It was said to grant its players infinite spells, but punish sub-par musicians with swift death.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[File:Strahd's organ.png|thumb|''[[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s mighty organ.''|350x350px]]\nPipe organs were often most appreciated by human communities; however, because of their size, price, and complexity, only the most wealthy could afford them.\n\n*[[Dwalimar Omen]]: the [[wizard]] captain of the ''[[Realms Master]]'' ship that traversed the realms via one of the ''Astrolabes of Nimbral'' in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/247/Rogues Gallery: Crew of the Realms Master|75}}\n*[[Halaster Blackcloak]]: constructed a monstrous pipe organ out of stalagmites and [[marble]], placed within his Music Hall. It's sound magically carried across the entire temple but was magically confined to the structure.\n*[[Skoradin Thinskin]]: a disenfranchised [[gnome]] [[rogue]]-turned-[[cleric]] of [[Talos]] who played his rueful pipe organ on board of the [[paddleboat]] called ''[[the Frothing Miscreant]]'' to bring doom to [[Cormyr]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/80/The Frothing Miscreant|30-31}}\n*[[Strahd von Zarovich]]: the master of the [[Castle Ravenloft]] had a sinister-sounding pipe organ inside his castle's dining hall."
