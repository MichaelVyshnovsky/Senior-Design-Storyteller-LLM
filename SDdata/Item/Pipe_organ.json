        "mainbody": "Pipe organs were unmovably huge and the most complex and of all musical instruments, consisting of a system of metal tubes, wooden shafts, usually controlled by two sets of keyboards.\nThese huge and stationary instruments consisted of hundreds of metallic pipes that rose up from the organs body. These vertical tubes varied in length, from a mere  to as tall as . Some of the pipes were controlled by upright wooden shafts and clogs that gave produced sounds increased tonal depth and range. The sounds were produced via a set of sizable bellows that pushed the air through the sounding pipes. The music was controlled via sets of keyboards (two to five), and each could be set to imitate different instruments or even a combination. The keyboards connection to pipes and the produced sound was controlled by a set of pedals, or steps, that allowed the air to travel from bellows to a particular set of pipes.\nthumb|250x250px|Skoradin Thinskin and his scornful-sounding pipe organ of doom.\nPipe organs were considered to be the height of ingenuity and musical art. The instruments numerous pipes and keyboards allowed for the widest range of sound compared to other instruments and even among their close relative instruments such as harpsichords. The pitch varied depending on the pipes size. Smaller ones produced higher-pitched music and vice versa. Some exceptional pipe organs had pipes so large, their sounds were imperceptible by humans, and pipes so diminutive that only tiny animals could perceive their music. When the player stroke multiple keyboards at the same time, the organ produced a multitude of chords.\nThe organ player was positioned directly in front of the instrument after setting the stops directing the airflow from bellows to the pipes. In order to operate the ingenious instrument, bellows needed to be pushed through the entire performance. Some pipe organs had a pedal just for that operated by the player, but most, especially the bigger instruments, required at least one assistant.\nIn 1364 DR, a Harper agent Danilo Thann and the rogue elf Elaith Craulnober encountered a strange pipe organ assembled out of reeds on their way to Taskerleigh. The strange organ tuned itself to music and caused the surrounding swamp reeds to dance to the melody. The music echoed from the opposite side of the swamp. The music reached a crescendo in a loud and deep blast of sound similar to a hunting horn. These organs served to alert a tribe of bullywugs who dwelt in the murky depths of the bog.\nSometime after 1485 DR, a gargantuan coral pipe organ belonged to the storm giants of Malestrom, the stronghold at the bottom of the Trackless Sea.\nDuring the Descent of 1492 DR, the magnificent ivory-keyed pipe organ of Elturels High Hall, along with the entire city was transported into Avernus and back to Toril after suffering from relentless fiendish attacks on the castle.\n*Astrolabe of Nimbral, a powerful magical artifact from the island of Nimbral that resembled a printing press mixed with a pipe organ that allowed the user to teleport the entire building or vehicle where the apparatus was located.\n*Bellows of Milil, a mighty organ that resided within the temple Arbalests House in Athkatla.\n*Hewards Mystical Organ, an organ that had the reputation of a fabled magical artifact. It was said to grant its players infinite spells, but punish sub-par musicians with swift death.\nthumb|350x350px\nPipe organs were often most appreciated by human communities however, because of their size, price, and complexity, only the most wealthy could afford them.\n*Dwalimar Omen the wizard captain of the Realms Master ship that traversed the realms via one of the Astrolabes of Nimbral in the late 14 century DR.\n*Halaster Blackcloak constructed a monstrous pipe organ out of stalagmites and marble, placed within his Music Hall. Its sound magically carried across the entire temple but was magically confined to the structure.\n*Skoradin Thinskin a disenfranchised gnome rogue-turned-cleric of Talos who played his rueful pipe organ on board of the paddleboat called the Frothing Miscreant to bring doom to Cormyr in the mid-14 century DR.\n*Strahd von Zarovich the master of the Castle Ravenloft had a sinister-sounding pipe organ inside his castles dining hall."
