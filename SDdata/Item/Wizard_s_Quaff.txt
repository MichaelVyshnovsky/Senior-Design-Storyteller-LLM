Wizards Quaff was an ale brewed in Voonlar specifically for the Whistling Wizard inn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
More accurately described as a small beer, the Wizards Quaff was a locally brewed, low-quality drink. Its only redeeming feature was that it was free to those staying in the inn. The price for non-paying guests was likely a copper or two, but few willingly chose to have another round if they could afford better.
