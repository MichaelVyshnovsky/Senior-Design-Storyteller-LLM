        "mainbody": "The '''''forester's brush hook''''' was a magical [[brush hook]] found in [[Uthe Lodge]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Description": "The brush hook had a long, straight handle and a hooked blade, similar to a [[kama]].",
        "Powers": "Despite being a fairly mundane tool, the ''forester's brush hook'' was enchanted to adaptively change its material and even [[alignment]] in order to bypass defenses and target weaknesses. For example, this allowed it to become [[silver]] to a [[werewolf]], or [[cold iron]] to a [[fey]], or adopt [[good]] alignment against a [[demon]]. On top of that, it was simply extremely sharp and deadly.",
        "History": "The blade was recovered from [[Uthe Lodge]], home of the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] after he was turned into a [[red musk zombie]] by [[Halsaime]]."
