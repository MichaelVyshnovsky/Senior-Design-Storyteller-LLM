        "mainbody": "Gebs quarterstaff was a unique melee weapon wielded by the avatar of Geb, the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the Mulhorandi pantheon.\nThe weapon was a quarterstaff.\nThis weapon carried a stout +3 enchantment that made it easier for Geb to strike and harm opponents during combat. The real power of the quarterstaff lay in its ability to duplicate the effects of any spell or magic item related to the earth. For example, Geb could use the quarterstaff to cast earthquake and then use it like a spade of colossal excavation and so on."
