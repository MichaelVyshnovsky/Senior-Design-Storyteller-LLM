        "mainbody": "crown of stars was a rare and possibly unique magic item that granted many wondrous powers.\nThe crown was a collection of extremely valuable gems that floated about the wearers head. The gems were often mistaken for ioun stones. The light from these faintly glowing gems could not be masked by magical or normal means. The gems were bound by an invisible ring of power that could only be harmed by a disintegrate spell or a limited wish.\nThe wearer of the crown of stars could use each of the following powers nine times per day dispel magic, lightning bolt, unseen servant, Evards black tentacles, and wizard eye. The crown could also unleash a meteor swarm or death spell once per day, but using either of these powers permanently drained a randomly selected attribute from the wearer. There was also a small chance that the crown of stars would vanish and shift to another plane of existence.\nIlrune Symbaern, a baelnorn who inhabited Myth Drannor, retrieved a crown of stars from some adventurers he slew."
