Coverlets, sometimes erroneously called bed spreads,
These coverings were light, delicately designed, and often lacy. Unlike true bed spreads, a coverlet was designed simply to improve the decor of a room, not to provide warmth.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold coverlets at a standard price of two gold pieces in its "Inn and Tavern" section.
* Arnise Hold, the familial keep of the Arnise family of Amn, had thick fur coverlets decorating the beds in its guestrooms.
