'''Coverlets''', sometimes erroneously called '''bed spreads''',

==Description==
These coverings were light, delicately designed, and often lacy. Unlike true bed spreads, a coverlet was designed simply to improve the decor of a room, not to provide warmth.

==Availability==
* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] sold coverlets at a standard price of two [[gold piece]]s in its "Inn and Tavern" section.

==Notable Users==
* [[Arnise Hold]], the familial keep of the [[Arnise]] family of [[Amn]], had thick fur coverlets decorating the beds in its guestrooms.
