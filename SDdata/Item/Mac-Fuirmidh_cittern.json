        "mainbody": "A '''''Mac-Fuirmidh cittern''''' ({{Pronounce|mæk|FUR|mid|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a masterwork magic [[cittern]] and one of the [[Instruments of the Bards]].",
        "Description": "''Mac-Fuirmidh citterns'' were pear-shaped citterns similar to [[lute]]s, superior in every way to ordinary citterns. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by [[bard]]s, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.",
        "Powers": "Bards wielding a ''Mac-Fuirmidh cittern'' had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\n\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these citterns had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a ''Mac-Fuirmidh cittern'' could invoke the spells ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[Protection from evil|protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[barkskin]]'', ''[[cure wounds]]'' and ''[[fog cloud]]'' each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.",
        "History": "The first ''Mac-Fuirmidh citterns'' were created by a legendary bard in the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. He used them to test and reward the students of the Mac-Fuirmidh level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.\n\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor."
