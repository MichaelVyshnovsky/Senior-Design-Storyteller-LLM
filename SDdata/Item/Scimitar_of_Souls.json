        "mainbody": "The '''''Scimitar of Souls''''' was a unique [[sword]] wielded by the [[god]] [[Iyachtu Xvim]].",
        "Description": "It was a black-bladed [[scimitar]], massive in size.",
        "Powers": "This magical ''scimitar +3'' was aligned [[lawful evil]]. It could cut through any magical barrier known, such as a ''[[wall of force]]'' or a ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' with no injury to the wielder. Moreover, a hit from it could drain life from living creatures and destroy outright [[undead]] that were not divine in nature.\n\nIf one had an alignment other than lawful evil and touched the blade they would be overcome by a feeling of nauseating pain. This would occur even to creatures of a [[neutral evil]] or [[chaotic evil]] alignment, though the pain they would experience was of a lesser degree.",
        "History": "The true origins of this blade was a mystery to most people, which was further complicated by there being many conflicting legends surrounding it."
