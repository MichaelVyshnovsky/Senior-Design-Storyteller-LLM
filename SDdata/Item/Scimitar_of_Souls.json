        "mainbody": "The Scimitar of Souls was a unique sword wielded by the god Iyachtu Xvim.\nIt was a black-bladed scimitar, massive in size.\nThis magical scimitar +3 was aligned lawful evil. It could cut through any magical barrier known, such as a wall of force or a prismatic sphere with no injury to the wielder. Moreover, a hit from it could drain life from living creatures and destroy outright undead that were not divine in nature.\nIf one had an alignment other than lawful evil and touched the blade they would be overcome by a feeling of nauseating pain. This would occur even to creatures of a neutral evil or chaotic evil alignment, though the pain they would experience was of a lesser degree.\nThe true origins of this blade was a mystery to most people, which was further complicated by there being many conflicting legends surrounding it."
