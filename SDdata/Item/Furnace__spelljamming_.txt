'''Furnaces''',{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|34}} were an early form of [[spelljamming helm]] that continued to see occasional use on [[spelljammer]]s long after greater advancements in helm design had been made.

==Powers==
Unlike other spelljamming helms, which took magic energy from [[spellcaster]]s, a furnace produced motion for spelljammers by consuming [[magic item]]s with their flames, though they could not destroy magic items impervious to fire. And creatures of [[elemental fire]], such as the [[w:c:spelljammer:Elmarin|elmarin]], could also be used to power them.<ref>

Because they required magic items, fueling furnaces could become quite expensive. Overfeeding a furnace could potentially make it more effective, but also put it in danger of exploding. And due to the fire furnaces produced, they could only be used within [[wildspace]], violently exploding if ever used within the [[Phlogiston]].

==Notable Users==
This variety of helm was commonly seen on [[ghost ship]]s, and were used early on by [[eel ship]]s until they were phased out in favor of major and minor helms.

On rare occasions, furnaces that had gotten loose from their ships could be found hurtling through the depths of wildspace on their own, moving at high speeds in relatively straight lines.<ref>

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] traveled into wildspace with a spelljammer piloted by the [[tinker gnome]] [[Ignious Rammousdammous]] to try and stop an incoming [[meteor]] referred to as the [[Hammer of Fire (meteor)|Hammer of Fire]] from crashing down upon their city.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|26-27}} The spelljammer they traveled on came with a dingy that was powered by a furnace helm. According to some sources, the adventurers may have been forced to use their own spelljammer to destroy the Hammer of Fire and were then forced to used the dingy and its furnace to return home safely.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|38}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors floated around claiming that furnaces may have originally been developed by the [[arcane (race)|arcane]].
