A potion of invisibility was a potion that allowed the imbiber to become invisible for a limited time.
The fluid of these very rare potions was invisible, but still had weight. Without holding the bottle containing the fluid, the bottle would look empty, but this was quickly disregarded if held.
If the potion was consumed, the imbiber would become invisible for a single hour. However, the effect of this potion would end early if the consumer attacked in any way.
Potions of invisibility were bitter-tasting. They could be safely held within pewter containers without going their potency.
Places and individuals in the Realms one could purchase potions of invisibility from included the following establishments
* Sorcerous Sundries in Baldurs Gate.
Potions of invisibility were considered to be a crutch for bad thieves and cowardly paladins.
* Alrue Crownshield, a song dragon from Silverymoon.
* Halbasho, an oni that inhabited the Quoya Desert.
* Sarissa Duncastle, a wererat rogue.
* Darien, an Elf mage in the Golden Legion
