        "mainbody": "'''''Forgotten Light''''' was a powerful magical [[heavy mace]] found in the ruins of [[Beckside Castle]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}",
        "Description": "The mace exuded a bright white glow from its head, and instilled a broad feeling of peace and safety in those around it.",
        "Powers": "''Forgotten Light'' was strongly aligned to the forces of [[good]], allowing it to smite [[evil]] more effectively in addition to weakening evildoers that tried to use it. It also powerfully magnified divine spells, especially those that healed, produced light, or smote evil.",
        "History": "The artifact was already ancient by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], and it was found in the collapsed chambers of Beckside Castle (fallen in the [[Goblin Wars]]) when [[Harper]] agents fought the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Gaston Wyrst]] for a piece of the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' hidden there."
