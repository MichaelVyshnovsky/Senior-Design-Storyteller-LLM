        "mainbody": "Grazzts habiliment was a suit of magical leather armor provided by the demon lord Grazzt during the 1480s DR.\nThe close-fitting leather armor left the legs and arms bare, composed simply of a jerkin, skirt, and sandals.\nThe armor provided broad magical defenses against physical and magical threats, improved the wearers vitality, and made it easier to dodge.\nThe outfit was granted by Grazzt to an adventurer that foiled his plans in Tethyamar. Though defeated, he playfully withdrew and left them a prize as reward for the good sport."
