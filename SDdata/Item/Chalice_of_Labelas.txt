The Chalice of Labelas was an enchanted work of art that originated from Evermeet. It was considered one of three Great Treasures of Evermeet.
The Chalice was crafted from silver, onyx, and chalcedony.
The Chalice remained constantly full of clean water. Anyone drinking from the Chalice was instantly healed of all injuries. The Chalice could even bring a dead person back to life if its waters were poured into their mouth. The resurrection power of the Chalice could only be used once per month.
As one of the three Great Treasures of Evermeet, the Chalice was kept by Amlaruil Moonflower.
