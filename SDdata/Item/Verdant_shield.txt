A '''verdant shield''' was a type of [[buckler]] used in the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]â€“[[657 DR]]).

These vine-wrapped wooden shields were associated with the wilderness and hence protected the user from attacks by creatures of nature. Furthermore, they were immune to the seductive lure of [[nymph]]s and the wail of local [[banshee]]s.
