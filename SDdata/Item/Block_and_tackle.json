        "mainbody": "A '''block and tackle''' was a set of [[rope]]s and [[pulley]]s that enabled a user to vertically lift objects heavier than their strength would normally be capable of lifting.",
        "Description": "A block and tackle typically consisted of a set of square, wooden blocks with greased internal wheels. These blocks were attached to something, such as a wall or tree branch, by multiple straps and harnesses in order to securely suspend it above the desired object. Finally, a rope, typically {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} in length, was then threaded through these series of internal wheels\n\nA block and tackle was commonly sold in three different weight classes. A light version was capable of lifting objects less than {{SI|200|lbs.|k|long=yes}}, a medium version was capable of lifting objects up to {{SI|1000|lbs.|k|long=yes}}, and a heavy version was capable of lifting objects up to {{SI|5000|lbs.|k|long=yes}} in weight.",

This enabled them to construct buildings with greater ease.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1174}}, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] construct a massive system of blocks and tackles that they dubbed \"the hoist.\" A system capable of lifting and manipulating seagoing vessels into or out of the locks that led to and from [[Waterdeep]]'s underground neighbor, the city of [[Skullport]].<ref>",
