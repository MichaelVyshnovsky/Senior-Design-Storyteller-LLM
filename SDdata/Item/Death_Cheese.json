        "mainbody": "Death Cheese was a unique cheese that came from the swamps bordering both Cormyr and Sembia. It was sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue Its name had nothing to do with any dangers of eating the cheese, but rather the dangers of producing it.\nDeath Cheese was a soft cheese that was rich in flavor. It was usually packed in a red paraffin rind, and was considered a delicacy on any dining room table.\nThis cheese was made from catoblepas milk. Herds were kept by out-of-work adventurers who harvested the milk from the deadly creatures so the cheese could be produced. The Marsh Drovers of the Farsea Marshes were also known for producing the cheese, as well as the less well-known Deadeye Butter, also made from catoblepas milk.\nDeath Cheese could be purchased from Auroras Emporium and most other shops for 5 gp per  loaf. It was much cheaper, however, to purchase the cheese directly from the Marsh Drovers at the marketplace in Eagle Peak, where a loaf of the same size cost only 2 gp.\nThe cheeses reputation included tales that the catoblepas milk was harvested by blind monks who could locate the creatures purely by a sense of smell.\nDeath Cheese imported from Toril was one of the most popular items in Imels Happy Tongue, a tavern in Sigil.\nDeath Cheese was one of the ingredients used in a foodomancy dish simply called basilisk and bread record in the ancient tome called the Manual of Culinary Delights."
