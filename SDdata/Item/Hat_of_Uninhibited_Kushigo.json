        "mainbody": "The '''''Hat of Uninhibited Kushigo''''' was a unique [[monk]] [[hood]] that once belonged to the famous monk [[Kushigo]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The wearer of the hood received a boost to their defense against magic attacks after landing a successful unarmed strike on their target. This magical defense lasted for six seconds.",
        "History": "Once, long before the late 15{{th}} century DR, the ''Hat of Uninhibited Kushigo'', along with the ''[[Garb of the Land and Sky]],'' was worn by Kushigo, a warrior who gave up his heavy shell of [[armor]] for freedom of movement after suffering a great loss. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the hood could be found in [[Harper]] quartermaster [[Talli]]'s inventory during the mission into the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] under the command of the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]]."
