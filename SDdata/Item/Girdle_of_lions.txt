A '''''girdle of lions''''' was an enchanted belt that granted the wearer several powers related to [[feline]]s.

==Powers==
When worn a ''girdle of lions'' allowed the wearer to ''[[Speak with monsters|speak with felines]]'' and made the felines in question regard the wearer in a very favorable light. The felines would often obey any reasonable commands given by the wearer. The wearer was also able to land from falls in such a manner that mitigated some of the harm from the landing. The girdle also made it easier for the wearer to move around in total silence. Lastly, the wearer could see in the dark just as if they were a feline.
