        "mainbody": "The Gong of Tyr was a part of the Fading Rings set. This unique enchanted ring bore the name of Tyr Grimjaws.\nThis brass ring was crafted out of three joints melded together.\nThe Gong of Tyr possessed an enchantment that reduced the wearers spell resistance in exchange for the deadly ability to cast the disintegrate spell. The ring was created exclusively for sorcerers.\nIn 1369 DR, the Gong of Tyr came to be in possession of the Great Stone Head, a mysterious magical monument in Myth Drannor. Eidolons, small totemic statues depicting various gods, were scattered throughout the ruins of the City of Song and could be deposited into the Great Stone Head. In exchange for each eidolon, the statue spat one of the Fading Rings out. The Gong of Tyr was one of the rings dispensed for the Veiled Ones on their quest to stop the Cult of the Dragon."
