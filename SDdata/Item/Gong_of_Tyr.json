        "mainbody": "The '''''Gong of Tyr''''' was a part of the ''Fading Rings'' set. This unique enchanted [[ring]] bore the name of [[Tyr]] Grimjaws.",
        "Description": "This [[brass]] ring was crafted out of three joints melded together.",
        "Powers": "The ''Gong of Tyr'' possessed an enchantment that reduced the wearer's spell resistance in exchange for the deadly ability to cast the ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell. The ring was created exclusively for [[sorcerer]]s.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], the ''Gong of Tyr'' came to be in possession of ''the Great Stone Head'', a mysterious magical monument in [[Myth Drannor]]. ''[[Eidolon]]s'', small totemic statues depicting various gods, were scattered throughout the ruins of the City of Song and could be deposited into the ''Great Stone Head''. In exchange for each ''eidolon'', the statue spat one of the ''Fading Rings'' out. The ''Gong of Tyr'' was one of the rings dispensed for the [[Veiled Ones]] on their quest to stop the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
