Pigsticker was a derogatorily named enchanted spear that was created specifically to hunt orcs.
Pigsticker was a long pike with numerous etchings on its haft symbolizing the number of orcs slain by the weapon.
This pike possessed a +3 enchantment and granted the user enhanced strength. However, when Pigsticker was wielded against orcs or orogs it became a powerful +5 weapon.
In 1369 DR, Pigsticker, along with Headsplitter, were in the possession of the Cult of the Dragon that occupied the ruins of Myth Drannor at the time. The enchanted spear could be found in the part of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor used as a prison by the cultists and the drow House Freth that was allied with them.
