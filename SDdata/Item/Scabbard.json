This was because they were often [[soulknife|soulknives]] who could manifest a blade of psychic energy and thus did not need a physical blade in their scabbards.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionic Races and Classes (Blues, Duergar, and Elans)}}\n\nIn [[thieves' cant]], the word for \"sword\" was ''kam'', and the word for \"container\" was ''kanab''; the word for \"scabbard\" was simply ''kamkanab''.{{Cite dragon/66/Thieves' Cant|38}}"
