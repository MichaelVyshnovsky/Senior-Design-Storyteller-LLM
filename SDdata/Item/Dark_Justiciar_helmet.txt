Dark Justiciar helmets were enchanted helmets worn by the elite order of Sharran servants in the late 14 century DR.
These magic helms were a part of the Dark Justiciar uniform. They were decorated with a fanned spiked coronet resembling a halo around the Justiciars head. The helmets front was a mask of a face frozen in grim and stiff-lipped intent to frighten and intimidate those who looked upon the Justiciars.
Apart from intimidation and protection, Dark Justiciar helmets were enchanted to protect the wearers from spells and boost their constitution. Additionally, when the wearer was obscured by shadow or darkness, the helmets magic made it easier for the wearer to land praise and devastating attacks.
Sometime in the late 14 century DR, Dark Justiciars were trained in a massive subterranean temple dedicated to the Lady of Loss underneath the town of Reithwin in the Western Heartlands. This Gauntlet of Shar was ruined and its inhabitants slaughtered by a servant of a powerful cambion spawn of Mephistopheles named Raphael by the . A single enchanted Dark Justiciar helmet was still hidden within the Gauntlet, along with a set of Dark Justiciar half-plate, waiting for a new worshipper of the Lady of Loss to pass the trails and become a new Dark Justiciar.
