        "mainbody": "dalias flute was a magical flute that affected a persons emotions.\nIdalias flute was a small and rather ordinary-looking flute carved from a piece of gray driftwood , yet it played beautiful, clear music. It was said that Idalia put a key inside this flute to unlock any heart.\nThe flute was carved by the monk Idalia of the Yellow Rose. The carving became the focus of his existence and he nearly starved to death completing it.\nThe flute was lost and centuries after Idalias death it fell into the hands of Ilnezhara, a dragon disguised as a human in Heliogabalus. In the , Ilnezharas sister, Tazmikella, hired Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle to retrieve the flute. The task was in fact a ploy for the two dragon sisters to judge the abilities of the pair. They proved themselves worthy and Ilnezhara gave the flute to Artemis, telling him, \"Perhaps you will come to better appreciate beauty you cannot yet understand.\"\nFor Artemis, playing the flute helped to clear his thoughts. Jarlaxle persuaded him to do so often, believing it would help Artemis free himself of his emotional burdens. However, the flute brought up old, unwelcome memories and placed Artemis in a state of emotional turmoil. Eventually seeing the flute as part of Jarlaxles attempt to manipulate him, he threw it to the ground at Jarlaxles feet, wanting no more to do with it or Jarlaxle.\nA century later, when Artemis was enslaved by the sword Charons Claw, he believed that Idalias flute would have kept the swords powers at bay, but as far as he knew the flute was in the possession of Jarlaxle."
