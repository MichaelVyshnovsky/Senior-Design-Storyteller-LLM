Waters of devotion was a potion that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The imbiber of this potion was placed under the control of the person who gave it to them. The imbibers mental capacities were still intact, but they remained loyal to the giver. The potions effects lasted for one month, but could be dispelled by magical means at any time.
