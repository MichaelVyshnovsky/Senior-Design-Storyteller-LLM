'''''Tapestries of folded existence''''' were [[magical item]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. They were only carried or used by [[holy slayer]]s.

==Description==
These tapestries always depicted an interior space. The threads of these tapestries depicted detailed accounts of everything brought into the room. They typically measured 6 feet by 10 feet (1.8 by 3.0 meters) and were of the highest quality. These tapestries were heavy, requiring two people to carry.

==Powers==
When hung on a wall or placed on the floor, the owner of one of these tapestries spoke a command word and was instantly transported to the room depicted on the thread. These items were perfect for use as treasuries, armories, and even prisons. Living creatures stored in these magical rooms did not require sustenance. A ''tapestry of folded existence'' was an [[item of cloaked wizardry]], and ''[[detect magic]]'' [[spell]]s did not reveal their enchantment.

==History==
Sometime around [[1367 DR]], a [[holy slayer]] by the name of [[Farid al Tigrar]] was tasked by [[Diyab al Kaban]] with assassinating with [[Hakim ibn Rashad]]. To this end he procured various types of desert animals and plants, secured them within a ''tapestry of folded existence'', and arranged for a [[merchant-rogue]] to sell that [[tapestry]] to Hakim when he next visited the bazaar in the city of [[Qadib]].{{Cite dungeon/47/The Assassin Within|61}}{{AQ-time}}
