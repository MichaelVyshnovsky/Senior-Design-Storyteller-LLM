'''''Hellfire powder''''' was a dangerous and volatile substance used to increase flames' temperature.

==Description==
This substance was a fine powder of reddish-orange hue, packed in {{SI|0.3|lb|k|long=yes}} [[pouch]]es. When added to regular fire, ''hellfire powder'' dramatically increased its temperature. Because of that, ''hellfire powder'' was used by master smiths to melt and work such tough metals as [[adamantine]]. However, with usefulness came danger. ''Hellfire powder'' was an unstable substance that could become a ''[[fireball]]'' at any moment.

==History==
''Hellfire powder'' retained its potency and properties for centuries, even if left untouched within ruins for many generations. The substance was in use in the forges of the ancient [[Imaskar]]. And by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''hellfire powder'' was in use in [[Rashemen]],
