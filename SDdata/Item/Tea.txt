'''Tea''', also known as a '''tisane''' or '''infusion''', was a common beverage drunk across [[Faerûn]] and [[Kara-Tur]]. In [[Wa-an]], it was called '''''cha'''''.<ref>

==Brewing==
In Faerûn, teas were commonly brewed by pouring boiling water into a container filled with tea leaves, which were then strained out. In the [[Shining South]], leaves were whisked in a bowl and powdered to make a murky brew, while port cities picked up assorted methods from travelers from other lands. and [[tea pot]]s (3 [[sp]]).

In Faerûn, tea leaves were typically stored in metal coffers, which had greater value than the cheap tea within. Their lids were sealed air-tight with an edible [[gum]] or [[oil]], known as "sticky-rim".  Among the poor, tea leaves were often reused. People dried them on a shield in the sun before putting them back in the pot, with a few fresh leaves, to brew them again.

In Kara-Tur, necessary implements for tea making included a dedicated table, a [[brazier]], a [[kettle]], and a tea caddy. These could be family heirlooms and works of art. A simple tea set might be made of [[bamboo]].<ref>

==Tea in Kara-Tur==
Tea was the most common beverage across Kara-Tur, typically enjoyed at the midday meal and in the afternoon, Tea drinking was elevated to a refined art by the [[Shou]]. In [[Wa]], tea and [[sake]] were served as refreshments to guests.<ref>

Dedicated [[tea house]]s could be found in [[Shou Lung]], [[Kozakura]], and Wa. Wa also had tea gardens and tea rooms in noble houses.<ref>

There were a great many variations. Most folk had it plain, but the nomads added [[milk]] and sugar, and even made it into a soup. The [[Tuigan]]s had their tea with [[salt]] and milk. The [[Khazari]] had theirs with [[butter]] and sugar.

==Tea in Faerûn==
[[File:Chultan tea leaves.png|thumb|''A harvest of [[Chultan]] tea leaves.'']]
In Faerûn, homegrown teas were largely [[wikipedia:Herbal tea|tisanes or infusions]] of herbs and the leaves of various different plants, rather than proper "tea" plants. These were made from local wild plants, picked by country folk and their children as needed. Hence, they varied widely and travelers expected tea to taste different from place to place. Actual teas were only easy to get in rich cities, such as [[Athkatla]] and [[Calimport]], where clubs of tea-fanciers paid highly for them.

Tea was a common beverage, usually served to quench thirst in restaurantsAccording to ''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]'', page 94, "Tea in most dining houses (restaurants) replaces the real-world 'dusty glass of water on the table.'" or as a non-alcoholic beverage at social functions,<ref> or enjoyed as an afternoon snack. It was always served plain; milk was never used or [[shortbread]].

}}Medicinal herbs could be taken by brewing them as a tea, such as for [[dathlil]]. A balm made from tea leaves was a common salve for open wounds; it had no real effect.

A species of tea grew on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] known as [[chatali]].{{Cite dragon+/16/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalué Part Two}} Locals commonly brewed their tea with [[cinnamon]], [[sugar]], and [[milk]], and there existed tea houses in [[Port Nyanzaru]].

==Trade==
In Shou Lung, [[Shangtou]] and [[Keelung]] were renowned for their fine teas, while much tea was produced in [[Hungtse]] province. In Wa, almost every farm included a good number of tea bushes, which were sometimes planted in lines to mark properties and boundaries.

Tea was still a recent introduction to Kozakura by the 1350s DR, but it fast became a key commodity, owing to its popularity among the upper classes. It was cultivated on warm mountain slopes in [[Miyama Province]], but while the volume of production was still small, the land used for tea-growing was increasing.

Shou teas were introduced to Faerûn in the early 1360s [[DR]] through [[Aurora's Emporium]], with at least two varieties ([[Pale Jade]] and [[Earth Dragon's Eye]]) made available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Teas from Shou Lung were known for being both invigorating and soothing.

Owing to their strictly local nature, Faerûnian teas were rarely traded far or priced highly. They were traded so little that no authority levied duties on tea commerce, not even by the caravan (only any regular fees for ships docking or [[wagon]]s entering city gates applied). In fact, dedicated tea traders were even viewed with suspicion, as if they were mad or engaged in something underhanded instead. Because of this, trading [[coffee]] was more profitable and popular than tea.

==Cost==
In Kara-Tur, {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}} of tea cost 1 [[tael]]. ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' sold the same amount of Pale Jade for 20 [[gold piece]]s and Earth Dragon's Eye for 50 gold pieces.

==Magic & Ritual==
[[File:ME-Tea Set.png|thumb|200px|''A tea set.'']]
Tea was a possible [[material component]] for a [[shukenja]]'s ''[[protection from evil, 10' radius]]'', replacing [[holy water]] in tracing a circle on the ground.

The [[tea ceremony]] was a vital ritual practiced by nobility and merchants in some lands of Kara-Tur, with the aim of instilling complete calm or demonstrating full and proper courtesy.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|4-7}}

Some people read tea leaves as a means of [[divination]]. This was used by some members of the [[silver ladies]] of [[Selûne]].

Chultan tea was used in preparation of curative infusions that treated several common afflictions. This pleasant-tasting remedy was concocted using tea, [[woad]], [[senna]] leaves, and spins water.
