Tea, also known as a tisane or infusion, was a common beverage drunk across Faerûn and Kara-Tur. In Wa-an, it was called cha.
In Faerûn, teas were commonly brewed by pouring boiling water into a container filled with tea leaves, which were then strained out. In the Shining South, leaves were whisked in a bowl and powdered to make a murky brew, while port cities picked up assorted methods from travelers from other lands. and tea pots (3 sp).
In Faerûn, tea leaves were typically stored in metal coffers, which had greater value than the cheap tea within. Their lids were sealed air-tight with an edible gum or oil, known as "sticky-rim".  Among the poor, tea leaves were often reused. People dried them on a shield in the sun before putting them back in the pot, with a few fresh leaves, to brew them again.
In Kara-Tur, necessary implements for tea making included a dedicated table, a brazier, a kettle, and a tea caddy. These could be family heirlooms and works of art. A simple tea set might be made of bamboo.

In Faerûn, homegrown teas were largely tisanes or infusions of herbs and the leaves of various different plants, rather than proper "tea" plants. These were made from local wild plants, picked by country folk and their children as needed. Hence, they varied widely and travelers expected tea to taste different from place to place. Actual teas were only easy to get in rich cities, such as Athkatla and Calimport, where clubs of tea-fanciers paid highly for them.
Tea was a common beverage, usually served to quench thirst in restaurantsAccording to Ed Greenwood Presents Elminsters Forgotten Realms, page 94, "Tea in most dining houses (restaurants) replaces the real-world dusty glass of water on the table." or as a non-alcoholic beverage at social functions, or enjoyed as an afternoon snack.

Tea was still a recent introduction to Kozakura by the 1350s DR, but it fast became a key commodity, owing to its popularity among the upper classes. It was cultivated on warm mountain slopes in Miyama Province, but while the volume of production was still small, the land used for tea-growing was increasing.
Shou teas were introduced to Faerûn in the early 1360s DR through Auroras Emporium, with at least two varieties (Pale Jade and Earth Dragons Eye) made available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. Teas from Shou Lung were known for being both invigorating and soothing.
Owing to their strictly local nature, Faerûnian teas were rarely traded far or priced highly. They were traded so little that no authority levied duties on tea commerce, not even by the caravan (only any regular fees for ships docking or wagons entering city gates applied). In fact, dedicated tea traders were even viewed with suspicion, as if they were mad or engaged in something underhanded instead. Because of this, trading coffee was more profitable and popular than tea.
In Kara-Tur,  of tea cost 1 tael. Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold the same amount of Pale Jade for 20 gold pieces and Earth Dragons Eye for 50 gold pieces.
