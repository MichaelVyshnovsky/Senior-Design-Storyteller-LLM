The '''''Chesley Crusher''''' was an unusually heavy enchanted [[halberd]] made entirely out of [[iron]] that originated from the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''Chesley Crusher'' was a very heavy halberd, hard to handle because of its {{SIAdj|30|lb|k|long=yes}} weight. The weapon had a hefty iron haft and was slow to swing. However, the weight of the ''Chesley Crusher'' guaranteed devastating damage when it connected with its target, opening skulls and crushing limbs.

==Powers==
The ''Chesley Crusher'' possessed a ''+2'' [[item enchantment|enchantment]], with the damage done by the weapon being comparable to a devastating ''+6'' enchantment. The halberd dealt slashing and piercing damage. Only creatures who possessed exceptional strength could hope to handle the ''Chesley Crusher''.

==History==
The ''Chesley Crusher's'' first appearance in history was in the hands of the infamous [[Chesley|Ensign Chesley]] of Waterdeep's first exploratory fleet, several generations before [[1368 DR]]. After Chesley, the halberd changed many owners through the years. In 1368 DR, the ''Chesley Crusher'' ended up in the paws of [[Ingot]], a [[gnoll]] who could be found in the [[Dryad Falls]], outside a gnoll stronghold to the south of [[Baldur's Gate]] and west of [[Nashkel]].
