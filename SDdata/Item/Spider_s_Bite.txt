The '''''Spider's Bite''''' was an crude but enchanted [[longbow]] crafted out of a body parts of a [[giant spider]].

==Description==
The ''Spider's Bite'' was created using fangs of a very large spider with a fine strand of spiderweb strung between the fangs as a [[bowstring]].

==Powers==
This enchanted bow was infused with magical venom that was projected with the [[arrow]]s fired towards the bow's target. When hit, it ate away at the target with potent poison damage.

==History==
This longbow was found by the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] ''circa'' [[1490 DR]], inside a cave lair of a particularly nasty white-colored giant spider that killed and cocooned one of the caravan's beloved horse named [[Sarah]].
