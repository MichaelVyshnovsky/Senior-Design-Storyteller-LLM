        "Description": "''Thyaast's staff'' was an ancient-looking simple [[quarterstaff]] of the [[elf|elven]] carving.",
        "Powers": "The mad lich's staff held a powerful ''+5'' enchantment. Additionally, it raised the wielder's constitution at the coast of their strength. The wielder of the staff also had an increased chance of survive negative effects of spells and mundane challenges. The staff held three charges of the ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' spell.",
        "History": "This enchanted staff belonged to Thyaast Ammath, an elven [[wizard]] who venerated the art of [[necromancy]]. She survived the fall of Myth Drannor in the [[Weeping War]] and continued her work in developing magics that could raise the dead. Eventually, she reached the state of lichdom and over the centuries that followed, suffered from deteriorating mental state. She kept ''Thyaast's staff'' close at hand as she haunted her ancient laboratory at the very bottom of the [[Elven Catacombs]], by the chasm that led into the [[Underdark]]. In [[1369 DR]], the staff could be found within the lich's lair, guarded by its mistress and her undead horrors."
