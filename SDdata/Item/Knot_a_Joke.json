        "mainbody": "A Knot a Joke was a enchanted ball of string that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.\nThe overall appearance of the ball was similar to that of an ordinary ball of thick string. It was golden yellow.\nIt allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and to tangle up opponents. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Knot a Jokes could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such balls were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Orn, the fire giant."
