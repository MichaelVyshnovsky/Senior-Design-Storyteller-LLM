Dragonskull talismans were enchanted amulets crated and worn by the members of the Cult of the Dragon.
Dragonskull talismans were small metallic pendants, shaped to resemble a dragons skull.
These amulets powers were activated via uttering the command words. The wearer became completely invisible to undead creatures, along with up two other creatures as long as they remain in physical contact. This effect was similar to that of the hide from undead spell. The effect lasted for up to thirty minutes.
A skilled wondrous item crafter could create a dragonskull talisman with the use of the hide from undead spell.
Dragonskull talismans were created by the Cult of the Dragon to allow non-spell-wielding members of the organization to easily pass minor undead creatures in service of the Culy.
