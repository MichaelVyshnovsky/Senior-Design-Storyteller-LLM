Hard-tack, sometimes called hardtack, was a dry unseasoned water-and-flour biscuit. It was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
The biscuits were dry and bland. However, due to its extraordinary resilience, hard-tack was a popular choice for long sea voyages. It was also a common component of travelers rations.
Some claimed that Valkur, the Faer√ªnian god of sailors, would on occasion manifest striding across the waves pulling a small boat filled with casks of water and sea biscuits to feed all sailors that fell overboard.
