Sword of Marshbane was the enchanted greatsword, created to be effective against lizardfolk.
Sword of marshbane was a heavy two-handed greatsword with a distinct scaly blade.
The tiny scales of the blade were designed specifically to be deadly to creatures with thick reptilian hides (+4 enchantment). When wielded against a non-reptilian adversary, the sword of marshbane still caused enhanced damage with a +1 enchantment.
A few weapons of similar design to the sword of marshbane were found in the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR. Conveniently enough, these weapons were extremely useful to the heroes from Phlan when they were forced to combat the lizardfolk led by a sorcerer Malgi Hi.
