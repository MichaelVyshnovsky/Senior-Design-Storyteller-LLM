'''''Sword of Marshbane''''' was the [[Enchanted weapon|enchanted]] [[greatsword]], created to be effective against [[lizardfolk]].

==Description==
''Sword of marshbane'' was a heavy two-handed greatsword with a distinct scaly blade.

==Powers==
The tiny scales of the blade were designed specifically to be deadly to creatures with thick reptilian hides (+4 enchantment). When wielded against a non-reptilian adversary, the ''sword of marshbane'' still caused enhanced damage with a +1 enchantment.

==History==
A few weapons of similar design to the ''sword of marshbane'' were found in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' 1369 DR. Conveniently enough, these weapons were extremely useful to the heroes from [[Phlan]] when they were forced to combat the lizardfolk led by a [[sorcerer]] [[Malgi Hi]].
