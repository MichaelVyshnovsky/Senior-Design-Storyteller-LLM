        "mainbody": "'''''Myrkul's Wrath''''' was a powerful [[scythe]] with various [[magic]] properties.",
        "Crafting": "To craft ''Myrkul's Wrath'', one had to have a broken [[scythe]] from [[Myrkul]]'s vault and the essence of the dead god's soul. Once combined, they became the formidable scythe.",
        "Description": "The weapon appeared as a black scythe, with a stone-like texture and darkness emanating from it.",
        "Abilities": "The scythe channeled the spirit of the god of death, and as a result was teeming with evil energy. ''Myrkul's Wrath'' was deadly to those of good alignment. The weapon also weakened its wielder in the hope that they would come to a gruesome death themselves."
