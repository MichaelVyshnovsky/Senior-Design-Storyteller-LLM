        "mainbody": "yrkuls Wrath was a powerful scythe with various magic properties.\nTo craft Myrkuls Wrath, one had to have a broken scythe from Myrkuls vault and the essence of the dead gods soul. Once combined, they became the formidable scythe.\nThe weapon appeared as a black scythe, with a stone-like texture and darkness emanating from it.\nThe scythe channeled the spirit of the god of death, and as a result was teeming with evil energy. Myrkuls Wrath was deadly to those of good alignment. The weapon also weakened its wielder in the hope that they would come to a gruesome death themselves."
