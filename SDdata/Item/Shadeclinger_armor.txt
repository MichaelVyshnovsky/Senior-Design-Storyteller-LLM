'''''Shadeclinger armor''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[leather armor]] worn by some stealthy [[Harper]]s.{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate III}}

==Powers==
''Shadeclinger armor'' allowed its wearers to become virtually swallowed by the shadows and darkness, improving their stealth skills. Additionally, the shadows protected them, dramatically increasing their chances of being affected by [[spell]]s, traps, or any other dangers.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''shadeclinger armor'' was known for being in use among Harper agents who preferred stealth and subterfuge. One such set of leathers belonged to quartermaster [[Talli]], a Harper who followed the Harper hero [[Jaheira]] into the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in order to stop [[Ketheric Thorm]], a warlord of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
