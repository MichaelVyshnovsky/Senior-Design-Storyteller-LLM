        "mainbody": "A '''''lesser vestment of power''''' was a [[magic item]] that provided a number of useful magical abilities to the wearer.",
        "Description": "These items usually appeared in the form of a set of [[robe]]s.",
        "Powers": "Foremost, simply wearing a set of ''lesser vestments of power'' made the wearer more difficult to harm with weapons and more likely to resist the negative effects of [[spell]]s, poison, etc. The robes also continuously granted the wearer the benefits of ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', and a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''."
