        "Description": "Dolmat was a dish of [[onion]]s stuffed with [[mutton]], [[rice]], [[almond]]s, and boiled to perfection. The seemingly simple dish, in reality, took a bigger part of a day to cook.",
        "History": "As of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Burning Pool of Natifa]], a small wonderous body of water in West Zakhara, was haunted by a kindly old woman's [[ghost]]. [[Natifa]] occasionally appeared to travelers who passed her stone [[oven]] on the southern side of the Burning Pool. She asked travelers to cook her a meal; if it was a tasty dish, she offered information as payment. Dolmat and baked [[battan]] [[fish]] were her favorite dishes."
