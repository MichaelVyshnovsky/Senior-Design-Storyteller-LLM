        "mainbody": "olmat was one of the traditional dishes cooked in West Zakhara.\nDolmat was a dish of onions stuffed with mutton, rice, almonds, and boiled to perfection. The seemingly simple dish, in reality, took a bigger part of a day to cook.\nAs of the mid-14 century DR, the Burning Pool of Natifa, a small wonderous body of water in West Zakhara, was haunted by a kindly old womans ghost. Natifa occasionally appeared to travelers who passed her stone oven on the southern side of the Burning Pool. She asked travelers to cook her a meal if it was a tasty dish, she offered information as payment. Dolmat and baked battan fish were her favorite dishes."
