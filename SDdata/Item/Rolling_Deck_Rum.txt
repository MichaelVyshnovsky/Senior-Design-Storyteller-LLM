'''Rolling Deck Rum''' was a variety of [[rum]] popular among sailors of the [[Western Heartlands]], inhabitants of the [[River Chionthar]]'s shores, and the mariners of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Rolling Deck Rum was a potent fortified sticky-sweet blended rum that was a good source of sustenance for those sailors with empty stomachs out at sea and a good cure for seasickness while out in storms.
