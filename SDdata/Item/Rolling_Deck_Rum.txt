Rolling Deck Rum was a variety of rum popular among sailors of the Western Heartlands, inhabitants of the River Chionthars shores, and the mariners of the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Rolling Deck Rum was a potent fortified sticky-sweet blended rum that was a good source of sustenance for those sailors with empty stomachs out at sea and a good cure for seasickness while out in storms.
