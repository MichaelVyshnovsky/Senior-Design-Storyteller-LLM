Pipes of the sewers were magical pan pipes that had the power to influence the behavior of certain rodents.
Even when not playing the pipes of the sewers, their attuned wielder did not attract the hostility of rats and giant rats, who became completely indifferent to them, unless threatened. Upon playing the pipes, the user could summon rats within  to form up to three swarms, which moved towards the music of the pipes as quickly as possible. The pipes themselves could not directly control the rats, but only summon them. They recovered their magic either partially or completely at every dawn.
The pipes could only be used by someone proficient with playing wind instruments.
Duke Thalamra Vanthampur owned a set of pipes of the sewers, which she kept along with many of her possessions.
