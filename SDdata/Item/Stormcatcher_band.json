Such prized rings were usually stored in small boxes, and well hidden.\nStormcatcher bands reflected magic from magical weapons, such as Kozahs Needle.\nIn 1463 DR, the succubus Arunika gifted the Thayan sorceress Sylora Salm such a ring. Salm aimed to use it to enhance her Ashmadai champion, Jestry Rallevin, and kill her archnemisis, Dahlia Sinfelle.\n* Arunika, who kept such a ring in a bag of holding.\n* Sylora Salm"
