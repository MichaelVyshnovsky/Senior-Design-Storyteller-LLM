        "Description": "''Talon'' was made of three pieces: the tongue ([[blade]]), the eye (the centerpiece [[gem]] set in the middle of the crossguard), and the hilt. Fitting the [[sword]] into its carving would combine the pieces, producing the powerful ''+4'' [[weapon]].\n\nAs well as being a weapon, ''Talon'' was also used as an access key to the Crimson Tower in [[Darkmoon|Temple Darkmoon]].",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], pieces of the legendary sword were scattered around Darkmoon. The [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] gathered the parts of ''Talon'', and assembled it. They used it to make their way further into the [[evil]] temple and destroyed [[Dran Draggore]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]"
