        "mainbody": "Talon was a powerful and strongly enchanted longsword.\nTalon was made of three pieces the tongue (blade), the eye (the centerpiece gem set in the middle of the crossguard), and the hilt. Fitting the sword into its carving would combine the pieces, producing the powerful +4 weapon.\nAs well as being a weapon, Talon was also used as an access key to the Crimson Tower in Temple Darkmoon.\nIn 1358 DR, pieces of the legendary sword were scattered around Darkmoon. The Heroes of Waterdeep gathered the parts of Talon, and assembled it. They used it to make their way further into the evil temple and destroyed Dran Draggore.\n* The Heroes of Waterdeep"
