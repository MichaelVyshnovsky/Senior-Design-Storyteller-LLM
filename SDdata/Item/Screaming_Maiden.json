        "mainbody": "he Screaming Maiden  was Barjins one-handed mace.\nIt was the color of obsidian, with the head shaped as the face of a strangely innocent and innocuous maiden. On of its own accord, the maidens face could shift into a monstrous face with a gaping maw full of sharp venom-tipped fangs, capable of plunging through flesh and bone, which greatly increased the damage inflicted. It was also capable of \"breathing\" a cone of cold. It was a sentient weapon capable of establishing mental links with those close to it, and it was always famished and seething with blood lust. The mace would even go as far as calming the wielder in order to be more effective in battle and letting the wielder look through its eyes when blinded.\nIt was noted by the imp Druzil that such a weapon could only be wielded by someone powerful.\nAccording to Druzil, it had unmistakably been forged in the Lower planes.\nBarjin probably used his considerable aptitude as a sorcerer to get it from the Lower Planes. When not using it, he usually kept it with the rest of his most valuable items.\nHe brought it with him when Talonas worshipers in Castle Trinity decided to destroy the Edificant Library with the Chaos Curse in 1361 DR. He would first use it to kill Mullivy, the librarys groundskeeper, who earlier led him to the catacombs of the library where the Chaos Curse was released. When Cadderly and his companions finally reached the altar room, Barjin used the mace to kill Newander. However, when he turned to strike Danica, Cadderly hit the head of the mace with a dart filled with oil of impact from his hand crossbow. The head of the mace shattered, releasing a tremendous cascade of swirling multicolored sparks and some little fireballs, damaging Barjin and completely ruining his already weakened clothes."
