The symbol of Chelsinara was a symbol worn by some followers of Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge. The symbol was named for Chelsinara, an important early priestess of Oghma.
The symbol depicted two cupped hands with thumbs touching and fingers pointing upward.
The symbol meant "I learn" and was used as a badge by followers of Oghma, priests and lay persons alike, to indicate their membership of the faith. It was also sewn in braid on each breast of the crimson or purple kantlara, vests worn by the clergy.
