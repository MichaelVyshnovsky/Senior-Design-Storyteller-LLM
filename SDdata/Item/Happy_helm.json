        "mainbody": "Happy helm was a type of handfood pastry baked by Bhaerusk Montalar and his family in Suzail, capital of Cormyr.\nEach happy helm was a small round pastry about a size of a human hand. It was stuffed with mixed ground meats, finely chopped vegetables, and a secret highly-spiced brown sauce. Then all the sides were pinched closed around, and the pastries were fried.\nThe pastries were eaten both hot and fresh in Montalars Happy House or by its takeout window, as well as cold, stored in ceramic clay jugs, potted with fry-oil for preservation.\nAs of the late 14 century DR, happy helms were a popular dish served at Suzails Montalars Happy House. They were priced two helms per single copper coin. They usually were bought with cider, weak ale, or weak berry wine.\nSome gossip in the area claimed that the strongly flavored sauce was spiced so Bhaerusk Montalar could sell extra alcohol to wash down the heat or even that the sauce hid the foul taste of chopped rat."
