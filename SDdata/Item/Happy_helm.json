        "mainbody": "'''Happy helm''' was a type of handfood pastry baked by [[Bhaerusk Montalar]] and his family in [[Suzail]], capital of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "Each happy helm was a small round pastry about a size of a [[human]] hand. It was stuffed with mixed ground meats, finely chopped vegetables, and a secret highly-[[spice]]d brown sauce. Then all the sides were pinched closed around, and the pastries were fried.\n\nThe pastries were eaten both hot and fresh in [[Montalar's Happy House]] or by its takeout window, as well as cold, stored in [[ceramic]] [[clay]] [[jug]]s, potted with fry-[[oil]] for preservation.",
        "History": {
            "Rumors & Legands": "Some gossip in the area claimed that the strongly flavored sauce was spiced so Bhaerusk Montalar could sell extra alcohol to wash down the heat or even that the sauce hid the foul taste of chopped [[rat]]."
