The jahlah (jah-LAH) was a small simplistic Zakharan drum.
A jahlah was a basic clay pot that was played by beating it with both hands. It could also be filled with small stones and used as a rattle.
The jahlah was found in the southeastern regions of the Land of Fate and was used primarily by fishermen and pearl divers.
