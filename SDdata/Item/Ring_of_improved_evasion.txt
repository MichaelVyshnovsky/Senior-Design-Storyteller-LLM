Rings of improved evasion were enchanted rings created by the Red Wizards of Thay to reduce mortality among apprentice battle mages.
When worn, these magic rings granted the wearer extreme nimbleness, making it significantly easier for them to avoid harm.
By the late 14 century DR, rings of improved evasion found their way from Thay to the other regions of Faer√ªn, such as the cities of the shores of the Moonsea.
