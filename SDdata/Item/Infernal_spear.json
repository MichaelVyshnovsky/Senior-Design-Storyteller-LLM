        "Description": "These [[spear]]s' tips were inscribed with filigreed infernal runes that imbued them with hellish magics.",
        "Powers": "''Infernal spears'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that increased their damage output and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. These weapons also dealt additional [[poison]] damage with each strike and had a chance of inflicting a longe-lasting poisoning of living targets.",
        "History": "These ''infernal spears'' could be found in the hands of the [[Cult of Bane]] that infiltrated the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The cult's leader, [[Enver Gortash]], outfitted his Iron Consuls with ''infernal spears''. Iron Consuls [[Mian]] and [[Nuff]] and their magic spears stayed at Lord Gortash's side in the [[Wyrm's Rock]] fortress, until his assassination by the [[Absolute Adversaries]]."
