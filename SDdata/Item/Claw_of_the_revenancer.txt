The '''''claw of the revenancer''''' was an enchanted [[silver]] gauntlet that had the distinction of being an [[artifact]] of the [[drow]] goddess [[Kiaransalee]]. It was famously wielded by the high priestess, [[Irae T'sarran]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Description==
The ''claw of the revenancer'' was a finely wrought [[silver]] gauntlet that wrapped around the hand and forearm of the wearer. It had an delicate bracelet that, by way of an intricate lattice, connected to a set of five silver rings that, in turn, attached over the wearer's fingers. Although it appeared as a purely decorative magical item, the ''claw'' was shaped to also be used as melee weapon and, true to its name, could inflict wounds consistent with a viciously clawed hand.

==Powers==
Uniquely, the ''claw of the revenancer'' had the combined powers of a [[magic ring]], glove, and bracelet all in one item. The ''claw'' granted the wearer a great degree of protection; it had the powers of both a set of ''[[bracers of armor]] +5'' and an ''[[amulet of natural armor]] +5''.

Additionally, it functioned as a ''+1 [[gauntlet]]'' in power when used during combat as a "claw". The ''claw of the revenancer'' conferred not only proficiency in battle but also infused the wielder's attacks with [[negative energy]]. These offensive abilities, combined with the aforementioned defensive properties, made it very effective in combat.

Most well-known among its abilities, the ''claw'' allowed its wielder to change a corpse into an [[undead]] creature. This could only be achieved by a wielder with access to ''[[create greater undead]]''. They used the gauntlet to touch a corpse, and this corpse would then transform it into either a [[revenant]] or a [[silveraith]]. The ''claw'' had a great affinity with its revenant creations, able to transform up to three corpses a day into revenants. Furthermore, these revenants were not independent hunters of their killer but rather were under the control of the wielder of the ''claw''. Finally, once a tenday, the claw could create a silveraith from the touched corpse of a [[magic-user]]. However, neither the creation of a silveraith nor a revenant could be performed on the same day.

==History==
During the course of the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[1372 DR]], the ''claw of the revenancer'' was wielded by the high priestess of [[Kiaransalee]] in [[Maerimydra]], [[Irae T'sarran]]. She used the ''claw'' to transform many inhabitants of [[Castle Maerimydra]] into revenants after she slaughtered [[House Ch√ªmavh]] on [[Eleint 28]]. A few days later, on [[Marpenoth 2]], Irae again used the power of the claw to transform the [[archmage]] of Maerimydra, [[Duneth Wharreil]], into a silveraith.
