Tanagyrs Stout  was a stout beer brewed in the Moonsea region. It was also sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
This beer was a heavy black beverage with a malty flavor. It was on par with Evermead when considering its headiness.
It was one of a scant few items exempted from trade embargoes against Zhentil Keep. Long confined to the Moonsea, it was traded to the south in the midâ€“14th century DR, sold in unmarked barrels to escape the stigma of that area.
Tanagyrs Stout could be purchased in the following containers
* Hand keg (35 cp)
* Cask (25 sp)
* Barrel (6 gp)
* Butt (20 gp)
* Tun (50 gp)
Found throughout the Moonsea, Tanagyrs Stout could be enjoyed in the Wet Wizard of Llorkh, the Savage Frontier, and in the Nashkel Inn of Amn, where it was priced at two gold coins.
