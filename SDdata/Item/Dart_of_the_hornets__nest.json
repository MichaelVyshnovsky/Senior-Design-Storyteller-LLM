        "mainbody": "dart of the hornets nest, or a dart of the hornets nest, was an extremely powerful thrown weapon.\nIn terms of appearance, these magical darts appeared the same as ordinary darts. However, when thrown, the darts would multiply. The multiplied darts would then emit mad buzzing sounds, similar to that of hornets. Such a powerful weapon came at a very high cost, as a single dart cost approximately 7,500 gp.\nRight after being launched, the dart would multiply and zoom towards the intended target. Generally, the more darts that were summoned, the lower chance they had of hitting. Up to twenty darts could be generated, causing an extraordinary amount of damage if the majority of them hit.\nIn the 14 century DR, a few organizations utilized these powerful darts. The Black Circle that had overtaken New Verdigris stored one of these darts in a highly guarded armory, as did the Silver Blades. A single dart of the hornets nest was stashed in a black dragon lair in Dragons Aerie, as well as on the second level of the Mages Guild of Myth Drannor. The Rivers Heart magic shop of Neverwinter had a dart of the hornets nest available for purchase, but it was very expensive.\n* Dutiocs, Chief of the Roadwarden Guard, owned some darts of the hornets nest.\n* Torm, a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor who was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets, sometimes carried a dart of the hornets nest."
