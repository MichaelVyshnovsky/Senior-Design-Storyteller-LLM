        "mainbody": "A '''''dart of the hornets' nest''''', or a '''''dart of the hornet's nest''''', was an extremely powerful thrown [[weapon]].",
        "Description": "In terms of appearance, these [[magic]]al [[dart]]s appeared the same as ordinary darts. However, when thrown, the darts would multiply. The multiplied darts would then emit mad buzzing sounds, similar to that of [[hornet]]s. Such a powerful weapon came at a very high cost, as a single dart cost approximately 7,500 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "Right after being launched, the dart would multiply and zoom towards the intended target. Generally, the more darts that were summoned, the lower chance they had of hitting. Up to twenty darts could be generated, causing an extraordinary amount of damage if the majority of them hit.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a few organizations utilized these powerful darts. The [[Black Circle]] that had overtaken [[New Verdigris]] stored one of these darts in a highly guarded armory, as did the [[Silver Blades]]. A single ''dart of the hornet's nest'' was stashed in a [[black dragon]] lair in [[Dragons' Aerie]], as well as on the second level of the [[Mages' Guild (Myth Drannor)|Mages' Guild]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. [[The River's Heart]] magic shop of [[Neverwinter]] had a ''dart of the hornet's nest'' available for purchase, but it was very expensive.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Dutiocs]], Chief of the [[Roadwarden Guard]], owned some ''darts of the hornets' nest''.\n* [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]], a member of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] who was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets, sometimes carried a ''dart of the hornets' nest''."
