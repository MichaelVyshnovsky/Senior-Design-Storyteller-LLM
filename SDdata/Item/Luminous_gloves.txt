The so-called '''''luminous gloves''''' were [[enchanted]] [[gauntlets]] that possessed illuminating capabilities, created sometime long before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The gauntlets' fingertips were made of exposed fabric that produced a gaudy glow. The wearer of the gloves gained slightly boosted physical prowess, and if they could cast [[spell]]s that dealt [[radiant energy]] damage, the gauntlets' magic illuminated the targets with a ''[[radiant orb]]'' for six seconds, making them vulnerable and visible.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''luminous gloves'' could be found in a chest among spoils and ruins of the battlefield on the outskirts of [[Reithwin]], left behind from the final battle between the [[Harper]] forces and the cultists of General [[Ketheric Thorm]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
