        "mainbody": "The Pendant of Ashaba was a magical pendant that was created by Ashaba, the first lord of Shadowdale, and was used to determine the rightful lord of the dale.\nIt was a silver crescent moon with horns that pointed upwards. Originally the pendant hung from a plain string, but this was replaced by a silver chain that was made by Sylun√© Silverhand.\nThe pendant, upon command, said in the voice of Ashaba \"The bearer of the token be the one and true lord of Shadowdale\". It could also detect alignment a little like the know alignment spell, but it could only detect very strongly aligned individuals such as paladins. The limitations of the pendant in this regard were thought to be related to the limitations of its creator, Ashaba."
