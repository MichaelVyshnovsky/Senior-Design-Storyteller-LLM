        "mainbody": "The '''''Pendant of Ashaba''''' was a magical pendant that was created by [[Ashaba]], the first lord of [[Shadowdale]], and was used to determine the rightful lord of the dale.",
        "Description": "It was a [[silver]] crescent moon with horns that pointed upwards. Originally the pendant hung from a plain string, but this was replaced by a silver chain that was made by [[Sylun√© Silverhand]].",
        "Magical powers": "The pendant, upon command, said in the voice of Ashaba: \"The bearer of the token be the one and true lord of Shadowdale\". It could also detect alignment a little like the ''[[know alignment]]'' spell, but it could only detect very strongly aligned individuals such as [[paladin]]s. The limitations of the pendant in this regard were thought to be related to the limitations of its creator, Ashaba."
