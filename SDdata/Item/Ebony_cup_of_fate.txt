The ebony cup of fate was a very rare enchanted chalice that allowed the user to change an encounters outcome through magic.
The chalices magics, or the effects created by the liquid inside, allowed the used to temporarily see into their opponents mind and change their strategy in the chalices owners favor. Such events as fights or battles could be easily resolved in the chalices owners favor. If the target of the ebony cups magic possessed an artifact, the chalices user could temporarily turn the items magic against the target.
