        "mainbody": "Sode was a type of armor used in Kara-Tur.\nThe sode was a protective armor that shielded the wearers shoulder. Typically square or rectangular in shape, it measured approximately . The sode was securely attached to other armor pieces, particularly the corselet, using cords. As a result, it could not be worn independently and necessitated the presence of the do-maru, hara-ate, haramaki, or haramaki-do.\nDuring battles, it was not uncommon to tie a piece of cloth known as the sode jiruchi over the sode. This cloth was often dyed or painted with a distinctive emblem or badge that identified the wearer."
