        "mainbody": "'''''Wavemother's cloak''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Umberlant]] [[cloak]] found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This blue cloak was adorned with [[Umberlee]]'s [[holy symbol]] and on the inside, it hid Little jellyfish-shaped pockets.",
        "Powers": "When worn in battle, ''Wavemother's cloak'' granted the wearer the ''damp aegis'' â€“ the magic that covered the wearer in a protective layer of wetness that made them resistant to fire and unable to be lit aflame. However, it made the wearer vulnerable to electricity and cold damage.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Wavemother's cloak'' belonged to Flood Tide [[Allandra Grey]] of the [[Water Queen's House]] in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate. She was willing to reward the cloak to adventurers who would investigate and avenge the death of [[Holli Dylford]], one of the [[cleric]]s of the Water Queen's House."
