A merchants scale, or balance, was an appraising tool used to measure the weight of items.
This small item consisted of balanced pans. Appropriate standardized weights were placed on one pan and the item being measured was placed in the other. If the pans remained balanced, the item being appraised shared the same weight as the sum of the standard weights. Merchants most often used the scales to assure that precious metals were not counterfeits, but could be used to confirm the value of any item sold by weight.
A typical set would include an assortment of sizes of pans and weights. The scale usually weighed about  and was sold for about 2 gold pieces in most economies.This is false advertising the smallest weight in the set is more massive than the weight of an entire cricket, let alone ones leg. Crickets weigh less than a gram.

For example, the scale was used in the iconography of the god Tyr, and the Church of Tyr even contained specialty priests known as scales. The god Amaunator sometimes manifested as a woman bearing the image of a scale on her dress.
