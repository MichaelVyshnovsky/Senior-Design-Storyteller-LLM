        "mainbody": "'''''Keys of disruption''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] keys that could seal any [[lock (item)|lock]]{{Cite dragon/256/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Tools of the Trade|90}}",
        "Powers": "When pressed into any normal lock, a ''key of disruption'' would change its size and shape to fit it perfectly. Once the key was turned, the lock would be mystically sealed and could neither be opened nor [[lockpicks|picked]] unless the same ''key of disruption'' was used to open it again. However, if the lock was that of a door, then the ''[[knock]]'' [[spell]] could be used to open it.\n\n''Keys of disruption'' could not affect magical locks. If a wielder attempted to use a ''key of disruption'' on a magical lock, there was a chance they would be inflicted with a shock of magical energy.",
        "Notable Owners": "Most guilds in the Dalelands possessed one or more ''keys of disruption''."
