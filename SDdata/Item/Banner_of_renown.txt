The banner of renown was a magical flag that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This flag displayed the moon and trailing stars symbol of the Land of Fate.
When held during battle, this flag inspired all enlightened persons within  with supernatural morale, infusing them with bravery and strength of arm. If the bearer of the flag was killed, the flag dissipated and all magical powers vanished instantly.
