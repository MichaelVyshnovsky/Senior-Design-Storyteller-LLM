        "mainbody": "The '''''golden orbs of Siluvanede''''' were [[item enchantment|enchanted]] spheres crafted by the [[sun elves]] of the ancient realm of [[Siluvanede]] (c. {{Yearlink|-8400}} to [[882 DR]]) in the [[High Forest]] to defend against magical assault.",
        "Description": "Each was a sphere of the most pure [[gold]], {{SI|1|inch|long=yes}} in diameter. They were imprinted with the symbols of the Siluvanedenn noble houses that owned them. They were carried in different ways, such as hung from fine [[chain]]s and worn as pendants, or simply held or pocketed, or even further enchanted to hover around an owner, like ''[[ioun stone]]s'' did.",
        "Powers": "Designed to shield against a foe's first magical assault, a ''golden orb'' held a Siluvanedenn [[abjuration]] [[spell]] much like the later ''[[Elminster's effulgent epuration]]'', being able to absorb and negate a spell directed at the bearer. It functioned continuously, but it could absorb only one spell a day. The bearer could choose whether to use it, but the ''orb'' granted no knowledge of the incoming spell.",
        "Usage": "The ''golden orbs'' were so costly to craft that each noble house could only own one. This was traditionally borne by the eldest member of the house.",
        "History": "The ''golden orbs'' were created by Siluvanedenn sun elves of the greater noble houses, at the height of their realm's power.\n\nWhen Siluvanede was defeated by [[Eaerlann]] and [[Sharrven]] in the [[Seven Citadels' War]] in {{Yearlink|-4300}}, the majority of ''golden orbs'' were confiscated and stored in secure vaults.\n\nAfter the liberation of the imprisoned Siluvanedenn [[fey'ri]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], they desired to recover stolen ancestral relics such as the ''golden orbs''.",
        "Whereabouts": "At least one ''golden orb of Siluvanede'' was recorded by the [[Harpers]] to have been lost inside [[Hellgate Keep]] when Eaerlann was brought down by [[demon]]s in the [[882 DR|Year of the Curse, 882 DR]].\n\nAnother ''golden orb'' existed in the hoard of the \"Druid Dragon\" [[Gildenfire]] by the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. It was hidden in a disguised [[weir tree]] in one of his treasure caches in the High Forest.\n\nA ''golden orb'' was valued at around 30,600 [[gp]] in 1370s DR money."
