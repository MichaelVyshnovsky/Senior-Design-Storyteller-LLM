        "mainbody": "The golden orbs of Siluvanede were enchanted spheres crafted by the sun elves of the ancient realm of Siluvanede (c.  to 882 DR) in the High Forest to defend against magical assault.\nEach was a sphere of the most pure gold,  in diameter. They were imprinted with the symbols of the Siluvanedenn noble houses that owned them. They were carried in different ways, such as hung from fine chains and worn as pendants, or simply held or pocketed, or even further enchanted to hover around an owner, like ioun stones did.\nDesigned to shield against a foes first magical assault, a golden orb held a Siluvanedenn abjuration spell much like the later Elminsters effulgent epuration, being able to absorb and negate a spell directed at the bearer. It functioned continuously, but it could absorb only one spell a day. The bearer could choose whether to use it, but the orb granted no knowledge of the incoming spell.\nThe golden orbs were so costly to craft that each noble house could only own one. This was traditionally borne by the eldest member of the house.\nThe golden orbs were created by Siluvanedenn sun elves of the greater noble houses, at the height of their realms power.\nWhen Siluvanede was defeated by Eaerlann and Sharrven in the Seven Citadels War in , the majority of golden orbs were confiscated and stored in secure vaults.\nAfter the liberation of the imprisoned Siluvanedenn feyri in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, they desired to recover stolen ancestral relics such as the golden orbs.\nAt least one golden orb of Siluvanede was recorded by the Harpers to have been lost inside Hellgate Keep when Eaerlann was brought down by demons in the Year of the Curse, 882 DR.\nAnother golden orb existed in the hoard of the \"Druid Dragon\" Gildenfire by the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR. It was hidden in a disguised weir tree in one of his treasure caches in the High Forest.\nA golden orb was valued at around 30,600 gp in 1370s DR money."
