A '''''shifting corpus ring''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] that could hide and obscure its wearer.

==Description==
''Shifting corpus ring'' was a simple polished metallic band designed to look positively common, like something worn by military scouts and pickpockets.

==Powers==
Through the ring, its wearer gained the ability to cast the ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[blur]]'' [[spell]]s, once per day each.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Flaming Fist]] traitor named [[Marcus (Flaming Fist)|Marcus]] wore a ''shifting corpus ring''. After his death at the hands of the [[True Soul]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]], who stood against the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Marcus's ''shifting corpus ring'' changed owners.
