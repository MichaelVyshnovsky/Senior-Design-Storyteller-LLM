'''Marka''' was a type of [[spices|spice]] unique to [[Murghôm]] and [[Semphar]].

==Description==
Marka was maroon in color, becoming almost black when wetted, and imparted a "fried meat" taste to the foods seasoned with it.

==Creation==
Marka was created by grinding up the branches of a certain thorn bush, which grew mainly in the foothills of Murghôm and Semphar.

==History==
Between [[1356 DR]]<ref> and [[1374 DR]], the [[Highmoon Trading Coster]] was one of the only mercantile companies known to trade marka across the [[Sword Coast]].

==Usages==
* Marka was often used to flavor bean stews, vegetable soups, and other bland fare.
