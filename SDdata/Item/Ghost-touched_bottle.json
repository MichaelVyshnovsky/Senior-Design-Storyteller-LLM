        "mainbody": "host-touched bottles were enchanted containers of translucent and almost invisible glass that appeared ghostly. Bottle stoppers appeared melded into the glass, containing misty liquid inside.\nThe magic was not held within the liquid but in the bottles glass itself. These bottles were ensorcelled with the ghost-touched enchantment that allowed the containers to contain small portions of the Ethereal plane.\nIn the , a ghost-touched bottle was left with Cahl-Hyred, the innkeeper of the Weeping Widow Inn in Targos by a cleric of Myrkul named Koluhm Bonecutter. Cahl-Hyreds superstition kept him from using or selling the bottle, and instead, he passed it along to the goblin slayers of Targos. Some said that later, the mercenaries were able to free a tortured ghost, Veira of the Weeping Widow Inn, and as the reward, she left them a single tear, caught within the bottle, suspended with the ghost-touched enchantment. They possibly used the tear to create the Sorrows Tear magic dagger."
