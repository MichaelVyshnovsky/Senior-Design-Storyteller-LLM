'''''Nymph cloaks''''' were magic [[cloak]]s that were named after beautiful [[nymph]] fey creatures and enhanced wearers' looks.

{{Quote|The charmers, seducers, philanderers, flirts, gallants, beguilers, ravisters, rogues, tempters, and tantalisers of the Feywild all share one common trait: they all make you feel as if you are the only diamond among the drift.|''Anonymous.''}}

==Powers==
Even though ''nymph cloaks'' were created with different enchantment strength, all of these magic cloaks enchanted the wearer's charisma by improving their looks.

Some versions of these cloaks found in [[Baldur's Gate]] allowed the wearer to use ''[[charm creature]]'', or ''[[dominate person]]'' spells once per day.

==Creation==
''Nymph cloaks'' of various power levels could be created with [[Elemental Plane of Water]] essence and corresponding [[gem]]stones: a [[diamond]] was used to create a ''+2'' enchantment, a [[star sapphire]] - ''+4'', a [[rogue stone]] - ''+6'', and lastly a [[beljuril]] - for a potent ''+8'' enchantment.

==History==
Sometime before [[1368 DR]], a story of a [[Cormyr]]ean noblewoman who used one such cloak to score a politically beneficial marriage was quite common. The same story also claimed that she bought one of the ''nymph cloaks'' for her new husband at great expense.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these magic cloaks were a popular topic among the tall-tale spewing commoners at many tavern across the [[Sword Coast]]. Many of these stories were about some hapless nobles who spent a king's bounty on these cloaks so they could look at each other without revulsion. Even though popular among common folk, most [[bard]]s considered these pandering tales to the tool of unskilled.

In [[1372 DR]], two of the ''nymph cloaks'' were available for sale at the [[Seedy Tavern]] in the [[Neverwinter]]'s docks, sold for fourteen [[smuggler coin]]s. Same year, a more potently enchanted ''nymph cloak'' was sold by [[Eltoora Sarptyl]] in the [[Many-Starred Cloak]] of [[Beorunna's Well]].

In [[1369 DR]], ''nymph cloaks'' were available to the abductees of [[Dennaton]], the [[Red Wizard]] proprietor of the gladiatorial pits of [[Thay]].
