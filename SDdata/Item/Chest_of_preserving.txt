A chest of preserving was a magical chest that prevented its contents from rotting or decaying.
A typical chest of preserving had a half-barrel lid and was  long,  wide, and  tall. Its interior was divided into compartments for storage. It could be closed with a non-magical lock, which, if destroyed, rendered the entire chest non-magical.
Food, drink, and any perishable items placed inside a chest of preserving did not age or decay.
The wizard Muiral owned a chest of preserving, which he kept in the Muirals Gauntlet level of Undermountain.
