        "mainbody": "'''Thaek buns''' were a type of local handfood delicacy from the city of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "Description": "Thaek buns were known for their pleasant mouthwatering aroma that often spread through the docks and the streets of Arrabar, where they were sold by many street vendors. These large buns were stuffed with spicy meats, [[mushroom]]s, and [[onion]]s, all drowned in thick [[tomato]] and [[pepper]] sauce that exploded out of the bun with each bite.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, thaek buns were sold across Arrabar during the festival of [[Spheres]]. The buns served as the first meal [[Vambran Matrell]] purchased after his return to the hometown after several months away on business for the [[Order of the Sapphire Crescent]]."
