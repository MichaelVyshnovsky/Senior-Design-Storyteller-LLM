Only spirits of indomitable will could enter buildings protected by such charms. However, charms of protection from spirits did not stop spirits from using magics on the areas protected by them. In order to be activated, a charm of protection from spirits was attached to the lintel of the protected areas door.\nThe more powerful a charms of protection from spirits was, the more proficient the crafter of wondrous items had to be. They were created using the  protection from spirits and heighten spell magics."
