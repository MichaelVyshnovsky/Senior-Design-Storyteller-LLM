The '''''Green Dragon Mask''''' was one of the five ''[[dragon mask]]s'' that carried the blessings of [[Tiamat]] in the efforts of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] to summon her to [[Toril]].

==Description==
The ''Green Dragon Mask'' was colored various hues of green, with a line of frills at its top and spikes jutting down the jawline.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''Green Dragon Mask'' gained several powers, such as reduced harm from [[poison]]s, overall greater protection from physical attacks and the ability to breathe unhindered while underwater. They were also granted  [[darkvision]] and [[blindsight]], as well as the understanding of the [[Draconic language]].

The main feature of the ''Green Dragon Mask'', or any others of its kind, was to transform its wearer into a [[wyrmspeaker]]. These individuals could think in a manner similar to [[dragon]]s, and gain subtle influence over their behaviors.

When two or more of the masks were brought together, they reformed as the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'', which combined their properties and bestowed them onto the wearer. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the [[ritual]] to free Tiamat from the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
For a time in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the mask remained in the possession of [[Neronvain]], the elven wyrmspeaker of the [[Misty Forest]]. However it was eventually transported to the [[Well of Dragons]] for safekeeping by [[Severin Silrajin]], and assembled into the ''Mask of the Dragon Queen'' ahead of Severin's ritual to summon Tiamat.
