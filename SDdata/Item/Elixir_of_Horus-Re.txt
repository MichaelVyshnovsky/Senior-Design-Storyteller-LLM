Elixirs of Horus-Re were potions named after the Mulhorandi deity Horus-Re and produced sunlight when consumed.
When imbibed, elixir of Horus-Re made the drinker glow with divine lights of Horus-Re, eventually releasing the light in a burst of searing sunlight, similar to that of the sunbeam spell.
In the late 14 century DR, these elixirs were a popular but expensive tool used against vampires and other creatures of the dark. Elixirs of Horus-Re could be purchased from potion-makers and temples of goodly deities across the Sword Coast the Moonsea region, and the Mintassans Mysteries shop in the city of Westgate.
