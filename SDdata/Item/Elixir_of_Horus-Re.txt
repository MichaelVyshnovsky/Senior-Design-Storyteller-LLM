'''''Elixirs of Horus-Re''''' were [[potion]]s named after the [[Mulhorand]]i deity [[Horus-Re]] and produced sunlight when consumed.

==Powers==
When imbibed, ''elixir of Horus-Re'' made the drinker glow with divine lights of Horus-Re, eventually releasing the light in a burst of searing sunlight, similar to that of the ''[[sunbeam]]'' spell.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, these elixirs were a popular but expensive tool used against [[vampire]]s and other creatures of the dark. 'Elixirs of Horus-Re'' could be purchased from potion-makers and temples of goodly deities across the [[Sword Coast]] the [[Moonsea]] region, and the [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] shop in the city of [[Westgate]].
