        "mainbody": "Bracers of armor were magical armor pieces for the forearms that protected the wearer with an invisible field of force that acted as a source of armor for his or her whole body.\nMost bracers of armor appeared to be a pair of normal bracers.\nThey could come in a wide range of power levels, ranging from protection equivalent to the wearing of padded armor to the defensive capabilities of full plate mail.\nCirca 1372 DR, a good number of the bracers of armor found in the wild around Neverwinter came from an armory of some unknown disbanded militia group.\nSome bracers of armor, such as the bracers of the blinding strike, came with additional powers.\nBy 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon was using rare magically enchanted claw bracers that served as weapons and bracers of armor.\n* Larloch\n* Sememmon\n* Shalara Swordshigh"
