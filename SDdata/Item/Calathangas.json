        "Description": "The ''rat blade'' possessed an extremely sharp, [[steel]] blade set into a rather plain hilt, adorned with a [[moonstone]].",
        "History": "The first noted appearance of ''Calathangas'' in [[Faer√ªn]] was in the hands of the [[Battledale]]sman warrior [[Rathinor]] in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the years when the [[Dalelands]] were hit with a devastating plague, Rathinor fell in combat while driving off a band of [[thieves]]. It disappeared for about 15 years, before a peasant sold it to a ruthless soldier named [[Xerastos]], for the price of six sheep. Xerastos' renown as a combatant grew quickly, due in no small part to his prowess with the cursed blade. A decade later, ''Calathangas'' exchanged hands again as Xerastos was killed by a [[paladin]] who sought to destroy the then-infamous blade. Unfortunately, the paladin fell ill before completing his quest and the sword had not been encountered since."
