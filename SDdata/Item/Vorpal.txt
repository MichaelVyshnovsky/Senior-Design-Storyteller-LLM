Vorpal was a magical quality for slashing weapons that increased the chance of the weapon severing an opponents head.
A powerful spellcaster needed the spells keen edge and circle of death to add this magic quality to a weapon.
Vorpal weapons were historically forged out of arandur, a blueish-green metal found streaking rock in vitreous glass. The metal was famous for its ability to hold the finest edge even after heavy use. The secret of working arandur was originally known to gnomes, but subsequently, elves of Evereska and Evermeet became proficient with the strange metal.
Vorpal weapons were great tools for getting ahead.
