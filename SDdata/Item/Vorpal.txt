'''''Vorpal''''' was a magical [[weapon quality|quality]] for slashing weapons that increased the chance of the weapon severing an opponent's head.

==Creation==
A powerful spellcaster needed the spells ''[[keen edge]]'' and ''[[circle of death]]'' to add this magic quality to a weapon.

''Vorpal'' weapons were historically forged out of [[arandur]], a blueish-green metal found streaking rock in vitreous glass. The metal was famous for its ability to hold the finest edge even after heavy use. The secret of working arandur was originally known to [[gnome]]s, but subsequently, [[elves]] of [[Evereska]] and [[Evermeet]] became proficient with the strange metal.

==Effects==
