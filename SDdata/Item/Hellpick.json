        "History": "Like many dwarven weapons, the ''Hellpick'' was blessed by the dwarven deity [[Moradin]] upon its creation. Its first known wielder was [[warrior]] Durlow Ironbar, who smashed countless skulls with this weapon across numerous battlefields. The name itself â€“ \"Hellpick\" was earned when Durlow wielded the warhammer against [[drow]] [[mage]]s, and their evil spawn pulled from the depths of the [[Abyss]]. Even though it was never confirmed, dwarven legends claimed that the ''Hellpick'' killed a [[yochlol]], the evil \"Handmaiden of Lolth.\"\n\nYears later, Durlow Ironbar was killed by a magically disguised drow who poisoned the hero. Despite being on the brink of death, Durlow used the ''Hellpick'' to kill four out of five assassins before perishing.\n\nOver time this weapon changed hands, until ending up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}."
