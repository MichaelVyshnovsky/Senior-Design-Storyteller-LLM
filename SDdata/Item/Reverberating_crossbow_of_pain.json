        "mainbody": "'''''Reverberating crossbow of pain''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[light crossbow]] from the land of [[Rashemen]] in the [[Unapproachable East]].",
        "Powers": "This crossbow was a fierce weapon despite it being incredibly hard to handle. The weapon always violently vibrated, making it challenging to aim with for all but the most experienced marksmen. ''Reverberating crossbow of pain'' possessed a deadly ''+6'' enchantment to its damage, and it dealt additional reverberating sonic damage to its targets. Additionally, the crossbow seemingly had an unlimited supply of magical booming missiles.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''reverberating crossbow of pain'' was lost in the [[Ashenwood]] forest of Rashemen. Its owner was found dead, their camp snowed in and frozen stiff. The tragic campsite was located not far from the massive evergreen tree, which was home of the Ashenwood's [[Wood Man]] spirit."
