Rune-lined skullcaps were a type of enchanted headwear, inscribed in long-forgotten language, and received wider use in the 15 century DR.
Rune-lined skullcaps possessed minor enchantments that invigorated the wearer.
In the 15 century DR, various rune-lined skullcaps could be found among bandits and heroes of the Sword Mountains, areas surrounding and markets of the city of Neverwinter.
