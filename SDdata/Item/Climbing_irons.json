        "mainbody": "'''Climbing irons''' were leg attachments used to make climbing wooden surfaces easier.",
        "Uses": "Climbing irons were metal rods that attached to the lower leg. A barbed ankle spike could be forced into a tree or wooden structure while climbing to ensure a steady platform for the feet. Many [[rogue]]s used these to scale wooden building in cities.\n\nThe drawback of using climbing irons is that the wearers movement speed while on flat land was reduced by roughly 1/4."
