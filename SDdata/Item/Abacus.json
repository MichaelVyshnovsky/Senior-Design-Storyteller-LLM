        "mainbody": "'''Abacuses''' were a type of tool for performing [[mathematics|mathematical]] calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was not possible to perform complex equations upon them.",
        "Description": "An abacus consisted of a rectangular, wooden frame that typically measured around {{SI|8|in|long=yes}} by {{SI|10|in|long=yes}} across. Inside these frames were several heavy wires, tightly strung parallel to one another. Strung on each of these wires were typically ten wooden balls. By manipulating these balls, a user could perform simple mathematical operations.",
        "Notable Abacuses": "* ''[[Abacus of calculation]]''\n* ''[[Occultant abacus]]'', a variety of magical abacus whose beads resembled little skulls and that had the power to alter the probability of those around the wielder.\n\n[[File:Digitalogist.jpg|thumb|''A digitalogist carefully calculates a [[spell]] on an abacus.'']]",
        "Notable Users of Abacuses": {
            "Classes": "* [[Artificer]]s often owned an abacus.\n* [[Digitalogist]]s often used abacuses.\n* [[Occultant]]s, a variety of adventuring accountants that were named for their use of a magical item known as the ''occultant abacus''.",
            "Groups": "* Abacuses were a commonly used item among many sages throughout the Realms.",
