A '''ferronnière''' was a type of decorative [[jewelry]] worn primarily by upper-class women on their foreheads.

==Description==
A ferronnière was a thin, delicate chain of precious metal worn on a person's head, displaying one or more [[gemstone]]s on their foreheads. Ferronnière were considered to be a tasteful sign of wealth and elegance.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Anorrweyn Evensong]], a [[wizard]] and the leader of the [[Sisterhood of Silver Fire]] from the days of ancient [[Myth Drannor]]. She wore a beautiful [[emerald]] ferronnière in her mortal days, and through the centuries that followed, in her [[ghost]]ly form.
