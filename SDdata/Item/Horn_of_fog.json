        "mainbody": "'''''Horns of Fog''''' were enchanted musical instruments that could create fog.",
        "Description": "''Horns of fog'' were musical [[trumpet]]-like [[horn]]s carved out of horns of [[beast]]s with a [[silver]] mouthpiece.\n\n''Horns of fog'' produced a deep sound, typical to other horns, the main difference was that the last note produced by a ''horn of fog'' dropped subtly into a lower register.",
        "Powers": "These enchanted horns produced a thick cloud of fog when blown, similarly to the effects of ''[[fog cloud]]'' spell. A ''horn of fog'' needed to be blown for at least six seconds for it to produce a {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} cube of fog. The created cloud lasted from 12 seconds to 3 minutes after the instrument's use. Each ''horn of fog'' couldn't produce multiple clouds, if it was played multiple times with at least six seconds of break between uses the new cloud was formed and the old one drifted away. The magical cloud slowly moved from the horn forward until it reached an obstacle, like a wall. It could be dispersed when exposed to wind.\n\n[[Bard]]s were known to be able to harness the ''horns' of fog'' magic to summon a magical rain on the area of the same size as the horn's fog effect.",
        "Creation": "A ''horns of fog'' could be created by a skilled crafter of wondrous items with a use of ''[[obscuring mist]]'' spell.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Aragauthos]]: a [[blue dragon]] imprisoned in [[Undermountain]] had a ''horn of fog'' in her treasure hoard."
