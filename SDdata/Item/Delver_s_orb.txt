The delvers orb was a small magical trinket fashioned by the adventurer Ususi Manaallin.
The orb resembled a small free-floating piece of granite wrapped in silver wire.
Ususis delvers orb was capable of floating around her head, and of shedding a cone of white light on her surroundings. It was also the focal point of her uskura.
Ususi built her delvers orb on her own, most likely sometime after .As no delvers orb is shown throughout Lady of Poison, Ususi must have devised the tool at some point after the events of that book.
