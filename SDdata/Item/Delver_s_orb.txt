The '''''delver's orb''''' was a small magical trinket fashioned by the adventurer [[Ususi Manaallin]].

==Description==
The orb resembled a small free-floating piece of [[granite]] wrapped in [[silver]] [[wire]].{{cite book/Darkvision|13-14|2}}

==Powers==
Ususi's ''delver's orb'' was capable of floating around her head, and of shedding a cone of white light on her surroundings.{{cite book/Darkvision|16|2}} It was also the focal point of her ''[[uskura]]''.

==History==
Ususi built her ''delver's orb'' on her own, most likely sometime after {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/Darkvision|13-14|2}}<ref group="note" name="NN">As no ''delver's orb'' is shown throughout ''[[Lady of Poison]]'', Ususi must have devised the tool at some point after the events of that book.
