The Incandescent Eye was a powerful magic gem originating from the Elemental Plane of Fire.
This crimson-colored gem was the size of a cherry.
So long as the Eye was visible, no creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire could harm the owner.
The owner could cast firefeed once per day to magically heal themselves when they touched any flame. When using this power, the intensity of the flame was directly related to the amount of healing granted, with stronger flames granting more healing than weaker ones. Any flame used to heal in this manner was immediately extinguished.
Once per week the bearer of the Eye could summon and command a large fire elemental as if the creature were summoned via a brazier of commanding fire elementals.
It was rumored that Nar-Aidiya was gifted the Incandescent Eye after completing a special mission for Kossuth.
