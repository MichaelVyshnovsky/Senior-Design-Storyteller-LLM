Sunstones were elven magic items originating on the island of Evermeet in both the Eagle and Silver Hills.
These amber-colored stones emitted light. They were easily cut and shaped like gemstones and used as light sources on Evermeet.
Sunstones emitted light for many years. The amount of light emitted depending on the size of the stone, with smaller stones producing an amount of light similar to a candle while larger ones could easily illuminate an entire room.
