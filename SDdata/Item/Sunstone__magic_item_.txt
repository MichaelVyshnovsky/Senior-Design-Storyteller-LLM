'''''Sunstones''''' were [[elven]] [[magic item]]s originating on the island of [[Evermeet]] in both the [[Eagle Hills|Eagle]] and [[Silver Hills]].

==Description==
These amber-colored stones emitted light. They were easily cut and shaped like [[gemstone]]s and used as light sources on Evermeet.

==Powers==
''Sunstones'' emitted light for many years. The amount of light emitted depending on the size of the stone, with smaller stones producing an amount of light similar to a candle while larger ones could easily illuminate an entire room.
