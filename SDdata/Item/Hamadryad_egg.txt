Hamadryad eggs were stones used as a holy symbol by worshipers of the Treefather.
Hamadryad eggs were white egg-shaped stones bearing a carved symbol representing an oak leaf. The carving would turn green when used by a faithful to focus divine magic.
Some eggs were known to empower the casting abilities of their users, and granted them limited teleportation abilities.
The first egg was carved by a cleric of Silvanus, who offered it as a joke to Metiai, a hamadryad. It was said that on the night of the next full moon, she gave the cleric the stone back imbued with potent enchantments.
