A '''''blink ring''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] with certain magical powers.

==Description==
Rings known during the [[Time of Troubles]] were plain affairs made of [[brass]], while those found between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]] were instead of [[adamantine]], unstably shifting between hands in a blink.

==Powers==
Early examples, known during the Time of Troubles, could be used constantly to cast ''[[blink]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', or ''[[mirror image]]'' or act as a ''[[cloak of displacement]]''. However, it had a cool-down period of about a minute between uses, and the displacement function became inactive for about ten minutes after using any of those powers.

A particular ''blink ring'' belonged to [[Thanadar]] of [[Dragonrock]], and it had instead the ''blink'', ''[[dimension door]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]'' spells each available twice daily.{{cite book/The Seven Sisters|33}}

''Blink rings'' during the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering referred to a kind of ring that enhanced thieving skills, and could daily be used for a minor teleportation, reaching no further than {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} away. It was possible to repeat successive teleportations for as long as concentration lasted, though the ring did not do an initial activation more than once a day. Users who had hit their stride and were yet to wind down from an earlier encounter could even push the ring to repeat teleportations with barely any attention involved.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Ulgon]], a [[Zhentarim]] mage in [[Waterdeep]] during {{yearlink|1358}}, the Time of Troubles.
* [[Thanadar]] of [[Dragonrock]], a caravan guard and associate of [[Laeral Silverhand]], by {{yearlink|1367}}.
