        "mainbody": "'''''Rattlefang's talisman''''' was a primitive [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that belonged to a [[gnoll]] tribe leader [[Rattlefang]] of the [[Wild Hills]] region, [[Delimbiyr Vale]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "This talisman was nothing but a simple chain with several bones from various creatures with chunks of dried flesh still attached.",
        "Powers": "Rattlefang imbued his talisman with the power to cast a dreadful [[disease]] on his enemies. The wearer was able to use the ''[[contagion]]'' spell once per day.",
        "History": "''Circa'' 1372 DR, the talisman, along with its original owner, [[shaman]] Rattlefang, could be found in the Wild Hills, several hours  of travel away from the city of [[Daggerford]]. During that time, Rattlefang's gnoll prime warred with the [[ogre]]s led by [[Guruk Bonesnap]]. Each of the feuding groups sought for a way to slaughter each other in order to claim a natural bridge over a deadly chasm for themselves."
