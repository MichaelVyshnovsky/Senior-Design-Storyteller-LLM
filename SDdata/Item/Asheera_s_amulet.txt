'''''Asheera's amulet''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] that was owned by the [[paladin]] [[Asheera]].

==Description==
The amulet was made entirely out of a [[gold]]-like substance.

==Powers==
This enchanted item increased the wearer's resistance towards electricity, [[fire]], [[magic]], and attacks from [[:Category:Reptilian humanoids|reptilians]]. Only the most powerful of [[Adventurer|adventurers]] could wear the amulet.

==History==
This amulet was specially crafted for the paladin Asheera by [[Magic-user|magic-users]] of her world, to aid the struggle against [[Morag]] and her army of [[Old One|Old Ones]]. The knight wore it when entering the [[Source Stone]] and when meeting the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. If Asheera's encounter with the Hero ended peacefully, she gifted the amulet to the Hero to help in protecting [[Faer√ªn]] and other worlds from the Old Ones. Otherwise she took it back to her homeworld.
