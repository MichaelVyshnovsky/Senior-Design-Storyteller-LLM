'''''Crossbows of the unicorn''''' were [[enchanted]] [[light crossbow]]s created in the town of [[New Mardale]].

==Powers==
''Crossbows of the unicorn'' possessed powerful ''+5'' enchantments, and while a person held one of these weapons, they could move with a breakneck speed as if affected by the ''[[haste]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
These crossbows were created sometime long before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the ingenious inhabitants of New Mardale to be used against an evil [[enchanter]]. The story claimed that the woman who weaved magics into these crossbows was inspired after witnessing a beautiful [[unicorn]] at the edge of town. She created spells that represented the [[celestial]] creature's purity and defense and enchanted the first ''crossbows of the unicorn''.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, some of these powerful items could be found in the hands of merchants and adventurers along the [[Sword Coast North]] and the [[Moonsea]] region.
