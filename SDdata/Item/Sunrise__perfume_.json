        "mainbody": "Sunrise was a mundane perfume found in the Realms.\nSunrise was a translucent yellow-orange liquid that smelled of freshly grated lemons. When applied to skin, it turned transparent and imparted a pleasant minty smell with a hint of lemons for about six hours.\nThe recipe for sunrise was widely believed to include alcohol, citrus fruits, and a mysterious secret ingredient. In fact, it was made of specific oysters, mussels, and snails boiled in alcohol, plus a few drops of a particular melons juice and a few drops of rabbit urine."
