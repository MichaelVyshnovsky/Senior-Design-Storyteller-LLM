        "Description": "Sunrise was a translucent yellow-orange liquid that smelled of freshly grated [[lemon]]s. When applied to skin, it turned transparent and imparted a pleasant [[mint]]y smell with a hint of lemons for about six hours.",
        "Preparation": "The recipe for sunrise was widely believed to include [[alcohol]], citrus [[fruit]]s, and a mysterious secret ingredient. In fact, it was made of specific [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s, and [[snail]]s boiled in alcohol, plus a few drops of a particular [[melon]]'s juice and a few drops of [[rabbit]] [[urine]]."
