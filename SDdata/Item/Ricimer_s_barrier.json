        "mainbody": "The Ricimers barrier was an enchanted shield, that could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor.\nRicimers barrier was simple looking small shield with a sharp spike perturbing from its middle designed to damage its target when shield-bashing.\nApart from the obvious offensive +3 enchantment to the shields spike, it served as a small but capable +2 enchanted buckler.\nIn 1369 DR, during the Cult of the Dragons occupation of Myth Drannor, Ricimers barrier could be found in possession of hungry margoyles who hunted in Windrider Glade, who plucked the magical item off one of their preys."
