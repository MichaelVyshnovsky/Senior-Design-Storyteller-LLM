        "Powers": "Typical holy books didn't magically affect individuals who simply read them or shifted their pages). It was however a common occurrence for those books to be protected by [[Glyph of warding|glyphs of warding]] unleashing magical defenses against creature of the wrong [[alignment]], race, or even temple rank. Such glyphs were carefully crafted by the churches with divine approval, and were hidden alongside various symbols, holy runes, and \"dummy\" glyphs designed to waste the spells and time of intruders.\n\nBecause of the divine permission granted by deities, holy books could be used by priests of the corresponding faith to learn spells outside the [[sphere]]s normally available to them.\n\n[[File:Wythyndles-round-book.png|thumb|right|150px|''Wythyndle's Round Book surrounded by two Sorlyn priests.'']]",
        "Content": "The exact content of holy books could vary slightly, but they were usually organized as follow:\n* An opening prayer or invocation dedicated to a deity. It was purely for religious purposes and didn't teach any spell.\n* A detailed ritual or offering to that deity.\n* A new ritual, or a modification of an existing one. For example a ritual to remove vermin from a temple, or a fastest way to learn from the deity the name a lay person would take upon assuming priesthood.\n* A collection of prayers teaching spells. They were ordered in ascending order of power, to ensure the novice's safety.\n* A closing prayer praising the deity. As for the opening section, this had purely religious purpose and didn't teach any spell. This section sometimes contained drawings of approved holy symbols, designs, of glyphs.",
