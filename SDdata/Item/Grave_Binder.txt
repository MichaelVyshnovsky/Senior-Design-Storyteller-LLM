'''''The Grave Binder''''', also known as ''Longtooth'', was an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] found across many locations on the [[Sword Coast]] during the late 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
''The Grave Binder'' and other ''Longtooth'' daggers were quite rare but were easily identifiable by their unusually long blades.

==Powers==
''Longtooths'' were ensorcelled with a simple ''+2'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the weapon's damage.

==History==
These daggers were known to exist as early as the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, one such dagger was stashed away in caves within the [[Wyrm's Tooth]] glacier claimed by a tribe of [[frost giant]].

Mother such dagger was uncovered several years before the {{YearlinkName|1368}} by a band of adventurers in [[south Faerûn]]. However, the owners of the weapon remained oblivious to its magics for years after the discovery. Subsequently, the adventurers delved into lore [[tome]]s and rediscovered the weapon's enchantment and extensive history in the hands of [[assassin]]s. This led to the dagger being renamed the ''Grave Binder''. However, soon after, the ''Binder'' was stolen and found its way to [[northwest Faerûn]].

In 1368 DR, a ''Grave Binder'', or possibly the ''Grave Binder'', ended up in the hands of the assassin only known as [[Krystin]] from [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Undercellar]]. She was hired by the infamous [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok Anchev]] to end the life of his brother [[Abdel Adrian]].
