Underdark cookies were dark, rich, and decadent sweet treats from the city of Neverwinter.
These cookies were known not only to satisfy ones sweet tooth, but also gave a small boost to vitality.
In the mid-to-late-15 century DR, underdark cookies became available during the extended celebration of Liars Night, extended into the grand Masquerade of Liars by the order of Lord Neverember.
