They were actually made by the yuan-ti.\nThey were triple-spired, silvery metal circlets.\nThe wearer of a naga crown could see through invisibility.\nThey could also create a magical energy sphere to prevent creatures from coming closer and to reflect spells back to the original caster.\nFurthermore, if the bearer was an arcane spellcaster, their daily spell allotment was doubled.\n* Marlspire of Najara"
