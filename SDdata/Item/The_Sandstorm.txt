The Sandstorm was a unique greataxe that came from a Bedine tribe in the desert of Anauroch.
The Sandstorm possessed a +2 enchantment, and it created a cloud of sand with each swing of the weapon. The sand made it harder for the axes targets to dodge attacks and had a chance of blinding the opponents for 24 seconds.
The name of the Bedine tribe that owned the Sandstorm was lost to history, but it was known that the nomads lived on the edge of the great desert. Local stories made the nomad raiders legendarily fearsome, with giant whirlwinds of sand that followed the Bedine into the fray, utterly destroying caravans. In reality, the nomads shaman was the one responsible for creating the The Sandstorm. Unfamiliar with his own impressive magical gifts, the shaman enchanted the greataxe to become a legendary weapon.
By the late 14 century DR, the Sandstorm changed several hands and eventually, ended up in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast.
