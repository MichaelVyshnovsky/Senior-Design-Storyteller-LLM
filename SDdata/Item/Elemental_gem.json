        "Description": "Gems that could be enchanted to become ''elemental gems'' included yellow [[diamond]]s, red [[corundum]]s, [[emerald]]s, and blue [[sapphire]]s.",
        "Powers": "Upon breaking or shattering, an ''elemental gem'' released its magic and allowed its wielder to summon an elemental in a similar way to a ''[[conjure elemental]]'' or ''[[summon nature's ally]]'' [[spell]]. Depending on the gemstone, a different elemental would be summoned: yellow diamonds summoned [[earth elemental]]s, red corundums summoned [[fire elemental]]s, emeralds summoned [[water elemental]]s, and blue sapphires summoned [[air elemental]]s.\n\nOnce broken and used, the gem lost its power."
