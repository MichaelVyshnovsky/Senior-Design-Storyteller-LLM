        "Description": "''Blades of venom'' appeared inconspicuous, not showing their deadly enchantment that coated the edge of the sword with magic poison.",
        "Powers": "''Blades of venom's'' enchantment added additional poison damaged upon hit.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], during the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], some of these swords could be found among disturbed and looted graves of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. One could be found inside a chest in the [[Halls of Stone]] and another in the [[Deep Halls]] among the ruins of an old war-time infirmary."
