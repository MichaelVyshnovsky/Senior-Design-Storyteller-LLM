Bastards Inheritance was a unique enchanted short sword wielded by the dwarvish rogue Larethar Gulgrin in the late 15 century DR.
Bastards Inheritance possessed a simple enchantment that coated the blade in weak poison that dealt a small amount of additional damage.
By the late 15 century DR, Bastards Inheritance have had been in Larethar Gulgrins hands for some time. The rogue often told stories of how he acquired the blade, but each retailing was a completely different tale. It was unclear if Larethar had memory problems or simply did not want to share the true tale. The dwarf wielded the Bastards Inheritance in the late 15 century DR when he joined the Champion of the Burning Dawn against balor Belaphoss.
