Steak and kidney pie was a cheap and simple pie dish, considered a lighter fare.
The pie was prepared with diced steak and kidneys, wrapped in a "shield"—a Faerûnean term for pastry crust.
In the city of Waterdeep, steak and kidney pies were served at the Inn of the Dripping Dagger. The dish was sold cold and they offered ice-packing and leaf wrappings for travel.
The Beldars Rest inn in Yartar, a town in the Dessarin Valley, served simple fare, including steak, kidney, and mushroom pies, which were popular with adventurers.
