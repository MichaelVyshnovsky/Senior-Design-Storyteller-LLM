A cloak of delight was a rare enchanted item that caused a sense of calmness in anyone who viewed the wearer of the cloak.
Regardless of the wearers natural charisma, the magic of this cloak would make anyone who viewed them feel a strong sense of loyalty and love for the wearer. Those affected by the cloaks magic would often carry out even the most bizarre commands just to make the wearer happy. Anyone attempting to attack the wearer did so with a sense of doubt which affected the chance of a successful strike. Creatures with lower intelligence could be entranced by the cloak to the point where they stood motionless for several minutes while they stared longingly at the cloak. Entranced targets would attack anything blocking their view of the cloak of delight.
The physical form of a cloak of delight would be different depending on who viewed it, changing from viewer to viewer.
