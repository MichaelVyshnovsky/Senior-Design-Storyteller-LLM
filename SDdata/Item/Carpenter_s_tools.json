Those skilled with these sets of tools could identify the age and purpose of wooden buildings, as well as spot faults with the structures. As well as this, they could identify weak spots in wooden floors or fortify existing buildings for a variety purposes, such as making a makeshift shelter.\nCarpenters tools were used across the Realms, including Undermountain and beyond."
