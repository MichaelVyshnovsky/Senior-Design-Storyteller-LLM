'''Prosthetics''', otherwise known as '''prostheses''', were artificial devices designed to replace missing body parts such as arms, legs, eyes, and other organs and appendages.

==Varieties==
;Teeth
:Replacing lost teeth, false teeth were made of materials such as wood, [[gold]], [[silver]], or [[porcelain]].
;Hook
:A primitive type of hand prosthetic that was quite popular among seafarers, which could also function as tool or weapon. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered [[brass]], gold, silver, and [[steel]] hooks in both [[human]] and [[demihuman]] sizes.
;Peg
:A primitive type of leg prosthetic, pegs were quite popular among seafarers. In the 14{{th}} century DR, ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' offered brass, gold, [[ivory]], silver, and wooden pegs in both human and demihuman sizes.
;Wooden leg
:A more developed type of leg prosthetic, but similarly associated with sailors.
;[[Clockwork prosthetic]]s
:An expensive sort of prosthetic limb or hand that was produced by the [[gnome]]s of [[Skullport]]'s [[Clockwork Wonders]] store. The limbs took a full month to design and one to three months to construct. Downsides included needing to regularly oil them to prevent their gears and mechanisms from jamming or corroding. They also also needed to be wound up several times a day. On the plus side, with an additional fee they could be outfitted with additional features like greater durability or hidden spring-loaded weapons.
;Drow craftwork
:[[File:Drow_prosthetic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A drow woman examines her prosthetic arm while a drow artisan watches.'']]The [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] developed advanced mechanical prosthetics with many ball-swivel joints and intricate parts operated via cables similar to tendons. These were precisely crafted and had hands as dexterous and arms as agile as the originals. Moreover, they were made from [[adamantine]], giving them both flexibility and hardness, so they wouldn't snap or shatter when stressedâ€”in fact, these could punch or claw through typical armors and the skin beneath. A delicate hand could be detached and replaced with a combat-ready claw or an attached [[axe]], [[sword]], spiked [[mace]], or other weapon when preparing for battle. Moreover, even whole-bodied drow would wear similar apparatuses over their limbs, giving them for example one-piece sword-gauntlets or toe-claws or spikes that aided in climbing and kicking in battle. Such devices were among the most common and most advanced of drow engineering, but the drow weren't in the habit of sharing designs among each other or with outsiders.<ref> A seller of artificial limbs in [[Menzoberranzan]] was [[Sh'aun Darnruel]].<ref>
;Gondar prosthetics: The [[Church of Gond]]'s members had their own distinct variety of prosthetic limbs that had a great "yoke" that would attach to their wearer. They were known for their proficiently articulated joints, with feet flexing at the ankle, hands having gripping power, and fingers able to be pointed. The most expensive of these prosthetics were laced with [[spell]]s that kept them bonded to a user and allowed for good motor control, though Gondar clerics had to be paid to renew this magic.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-11 - Gondar Prosthetics}}
;Kalgalast prosthetics: A variety of highly realistic limbs that were sold in the late 14{{th}} century DR by the traveling craftsmen [[Orviir Kalgalast]]. These multi-jointed limbs were made of a combination of wood and metal, covered in a [[rubber]] sleeve, and enchanted to protect against wear-and-tear (including cracking, melting, or weathering from sunlight or frigid temperatures). They were designed for humans, [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[halfling]]s. They could also be ordered to have certain skin hues or fingernail styles. These limbs could be quite expensive, with jointed limbs with full strappings but no rubber sleeve, costing around 2,200 gp, whilst merely a replacement "under-piece" (such as part of a joint, or a forearm) would fetch 600 gp. And for larger than average individuals, a limb could cost as much as 4,000 gp. Additionally, at triple the base price, Kalgalast could incorporate retractable weapons or hiding-cavities. Rumors, attested to by [[Elminster]], spoke of these prosthethics exploding on those who didn't pay fully for them, sometimes resulting in the wearer's death.<ref>{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/So What Do Ye Do for a Living?}}
;Magical
[[File:ProstheticLeg.jpg|thumb|right|120px|''A wondrous prosthetic leg.'']]
:;Realistic
::A wide variety of magical prosthetics that prevented others from noticing the body part was artificial and that their wearer did not have full use of it.{{Cite dragon/73/Non-Violent Magic Items|39}}<ref group="note" name="name">This type of prosthetic was never provided a name, so the word "Realistic" is used here to differentiate them from other magical prosthetics.
:;Wondrous
::A common variety of wondrous item, these functioned identically to the limbs that they replaced and could not be removed against the wearer's will.
[[File:Plangent.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Durpari individual with a plangent hand prosthesis.'']]
;Plangent
:In the land of [[Durpar]], a unique type of violet crystal known as [[plangent]] was discovered in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and used to create prosthetic limbs that were magically animate.

==Notable Prosthetics==
;Ebony hands
:One knowledgeable [[wizard]] was able to create for Kaverin Ebonhand prosthetic hands out of an enchanted ebony-black rock. Once pressed against a fresh stump, the magic molded the black stone into the form of hands. The magic hands acted as if they were flesh and blood but were made out of stone.
;[[Ersatz eye]]
:A type of magical eye prosthetic.
;[[Pegleg of Immurk the Invincible]]
:A magical peg leg that was rumored to have been passed around by adventurers after its owner was lost at sea. When grafted onto a body it would shorten or lengthen to whatever length was appropriate for walking. It allowed its wearer to summon a [[parrot]] [[familiar]]. It could detect [[gold piece]]s within a {{SIAdj|100|ft|long=yes}} radius. It made the wearer incapable of becoming seasick and proficient in navigating, the use of [[harpoon]]s and [[rope]]s, swimming, sensing the weather, and general seamanship. And finally, three times per day the peg leg could be tapped against something to unleash a ''[[knock]]'' spell. Overall it was worth around 10,000 gold pieces.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a barber in [[Silverymoon]] by the name of [[Jooge Nopsmoth]] would use his expertise in dentistry to replace troublesome teeth with prosthetics made of gold, silver, or porcelain. He also offered special [[iron]] teeth, which allowed his [[annis hag]] master to eavesdrop on their wearer.{{Cite dragon+/12/The Barber of Silverymoon|7}}

During this time period [[Arla Razortongue]] established the [[Peg and Hook]] in [[Luskan]], a prosthetics shop that unusually sold hooks meant to be worn in place of a leg and pegs meant to be worn in place of a hand. She managed to convince a number of pirates to try out this unorthodox method and later on would replace one of her own hands and legs with a peg and hook respectively.
