        "mainbody": "'''''Oil of acid resistance''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] unguent that rendered any cloth, skin, or other material it was applied to impervious to harm from [[acid]].",
        "Description": "Each flask of ''oil of acid resistance'' was sufficient to cover the entire body and equipment of a [[human]]-sized creature. Alternatively, a flask contained enough doses to cover twenty-four human-sized creatures for an active period of one hour.",
        "Powers": "One application of this oil lasted for a period of twenty-four hours. However, any exposure to acid would diminish the period of potency by a number of minutes equivalent to how much damage that exposure would have caused to exposed flesh. For example, if someone was exposed to the acid [[dragon breath|breath]] of a [[black dragon]] of [[great wyrm]] age the potency period would diminish by 1 hour and 4 minutes.",
        "Components": "Some [[wizard]]s were known to use the dried webbing of [[greelox]] as an ingredient in making these oils. Other potential ingredients for making these oils included the secretions of [[stone pudding]]s, the mucous coating of [[gray ooze]]s,<ref>{{Cite dragon annual/1999/The Ecology of the Gray Ooze|132}} and the inner layer of [[flumph]] tentacles. It took twenty flumph tentacles to yield a single serving of ''oil of acid resistance''.",
        "Availability": "Beyond [[Faer√ªn]],<ref>{{Cite dungeon/19/House of Cards|57}} ''oils of acid resistance'' could be found in the land of [[Zakhara]].<ref>"
