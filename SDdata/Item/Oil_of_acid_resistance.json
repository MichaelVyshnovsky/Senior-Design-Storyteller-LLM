        "mainbody": "il of acid resistance was a magical unguent that rendered any cloth, skin, or other material it was applied to impervious to harm from acid.\nEach flask of oil of acid resistance was sufficient to cover the entire body and equipment of a human-sized creature. Alternatively, a flask contained enough doses to cover twenty-four human-sized creatures for an active period of one hour.\nOne application of this oil lasted for a period of twenty-four hours. However, any exposure to acid would diminish the period of potency by a number of minutes equivalent to how much damage that exposure would have caused to exposed flesh. For example, if someone was exposed to the acid breath of a black dragon of great wyrm age the potency period would diminish by 1 hour and 4 minutes.\nSome wizards were known to use the dried webbing of greelox as an ingredient in making these oils. Other potential ingredients for making these oils included the secretions of stone puddings, the mucous coating of gray oozes, and the inner layer of flumph tentacles. It took twenty flumph tentacles to yield a single serving of oil of acid resistance.\nBeyond Faer√ªn, oils of acid resistance could be found in the land of Zakhara."
