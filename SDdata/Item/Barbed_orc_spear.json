        "Description": "Barbed orc spears were crude weapons. They had sturdy wooden hafts, topped with a cruel barbed spear head. When willed in battle, these barbed weapons dealt additional piercing damage to their targets.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, barbed orc spears were among many smuggled orcish-foged weapons provided to the looming army of [[Gorgomorz - Daggerford's Devil]] through his alliance with the [[Zhentarim]]. Many of these weapons were stockpiled in pirate smuggling sea caves in the [[Crab's Claw Coast]], southwest of Daggerford, shipped there on the ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]'', through the harbors of Daggerford."
