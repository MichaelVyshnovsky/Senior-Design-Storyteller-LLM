        "mainbody": "'''''Laeral's storm armor''''' was a set of magic [[full plate]] armor made from an unknown non-metallic material, rumored to be from another [[plane]].",
        "Powers": "This +2 armor granted the wearer protection from electricity and fire, and an immunity to the movement effects caused by strong winds. However if the armor was struck simultaneously by multiple elements, it would become brittle and permanently shatter.",
        "Creation": "Although the exact secrets to create this armor remained with [[Laeral Silverhand|its designer]], the spells ''[[gust of wind]]'' and ''[[resist elements]]'' were used in the process.",
        "History": "This armor was devised, and created, by the [[wizard]]ess [[Laeral Silverhand]], for her champions among the kingdoms of [[the North]]. About a dozen or so suits were known to have been crafted overall. As of [[1357 DR]], three were actively in use, two had been destroyed and the remaining seven had whereabouts unknown."
