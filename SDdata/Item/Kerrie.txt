A '''kerrie''' was a shaped [[club]] weighted for throwing, used primarily in [[Chult]].

==Description==
These throwing clubs were usually crafted out of a hard wood, such as [[ironwood]]. They had a long, straight shaft that ended in a flattened, rounded knob, usually about the size of a fist.{{Cite dragon/189/Rhino's Armor, Tiger's Claws|21}} Though this size varied, with some kerries having knobs that were larger than a fist.

==Notable Users==
* Kerries were one of the many weapons that [[dakon]] were typically known to fight with.{{Cite dragon/187/Ecology of the Dakon|27}}
