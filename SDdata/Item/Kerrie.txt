A kerrie was a shaped club weighted for throwing, used primarily in Chult.
These throwing clubs were usually crafted out of a hard wood, such as ironwood. They had a long, straight shaft that ended in a flattened, rounded knob, usually about the size of a fist. Though this size varied, with some kerries having knobs that were larger than a fist.
* Kerries were one of the many weapons that dakon were typically known to fight with.
