Dimensional shackles were magical shackles that not only restricted movement, but also prevented extradimensional displacement.
The shackles automatically adjusted to fit creatures of several different sizes, ranging from halflings to ogres.
A creature bound with dimensional shackles was incapable of any sort of extradimensional travel, be it teleporting within the same plane or traveling to a different plane. Travel through preexisting portals was still possible, however.
Although it was possible to break free from dimensional shackles, it was extremely difficult. It was only possible to attempt to break free from them once every 30 days.
* Baazit, an ultroloth that was imprisoned by a pit fiend in the Pit of Shummrath in Avernus for stealing soul coins, was also bound by dimensional shackles.
