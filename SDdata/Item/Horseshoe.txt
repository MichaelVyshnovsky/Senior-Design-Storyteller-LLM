Horseshoes (or simply shoes
Horseshoes were typically made of an iron or steel bar and hammered into a "U" shape. They were attached to horses by nailing them into their hooves, a process that was known as "shoeing."
Horses equipped with these were capable of traveling farther, faster, and for much longer.
When a horses shoe became loosened, it made a clattering sound as it walked or ran. If the shoe came off completely, they were said to "throw a shoe" or "lose a shoe", and the horse was forced to slow and limp until it was replaced.
