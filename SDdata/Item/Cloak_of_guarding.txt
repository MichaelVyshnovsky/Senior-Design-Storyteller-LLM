A cloak of guarding was an enchanted item that protected the wearer from harm.
This magical cloak appeared to be a regular heavy woolen cloak.
When physically struck, a cloak of guarding would instantly harden at the point of contact, deflecting arrows and other missiles, and negating some of the force of all melee weapons. The cloak would revert to its normal flexible state as soon as the strike was over. A cloak of guarding could not be harmed by any weaponry.
The cloak would also protect the wearer for a period of time if crushed on all sides. It would disintegrate into nothing when it could no longer absorb the crushing pressure.
The downside of wearing a cloak of guarding was that the wearer would experience maximum harm from any fire, cold, or electrical-based attacks.
