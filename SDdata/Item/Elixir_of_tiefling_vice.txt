Elixirs of tiefling vice were potions created through sanguineous magic arts by Araj Oblodra of Crimson Draughts in the late 15 century DR.
Elixirs of tiefling vice were distilled from the blood of tieflings, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with fiendish vice, allowing them to call on the diabolic arcana of the blood to cast thaumaturgy, hellish rebuke, burning hands, and flame blade. The blood magic of the potion was expended after one day.
In the , Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and a blood vendor, was using the blood of tieflings infected with the illithid tadpoles of the Cult of the Absolute to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in Moonrise Towers. After the death of Ketheric Thorm, she returned to the Crimson Draughts, her apothecary in the city of Baldurs Gate, where she resumed her sanguineous magic experiments.
