Riding boots were a variety of boots designed to be worn while riding a mount. They were commonly seen in both the lands of Faer√ªn and Zakhara.
A riding boot was typically constructed from stiffened leather. Some were designed with a break away strap system, allowing one to sheathe a short sword against their calf, while others had a sheath within their cuffs for concealing daggers or stilettos.
