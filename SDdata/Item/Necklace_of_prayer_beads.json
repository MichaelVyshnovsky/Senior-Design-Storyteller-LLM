        "Description": "Most of the ''necklaces of prayer beads'' appeared cheap and nothing more than a string of polished round stones.",
        "Powers": "These necklaces were usable only by divine spellcasters, such as [[cleric]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[druid]]s.\nThe ''necklaces of prayer beads'' that dated to the age of the old [[Myth Drannor]] gave the wearer the ability to cast the ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' spell.\n\nThe 14{{th}} century version of the item came with fifty charges and was able to cast a set of [[spell]]s, each consuming the certain number of charges. ''[[Bless]]'' consumed no charges, ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' - three charges, ''[[remove blindness or deafness]]'' - three charges, and ''[[remove disease]]'' - three charges as well.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]] one ancient ''necklace of prayer beads'' could be found on a master [[spectre]] of one of the fallen of the [[Weeping War]] deep in the [[Elven Catacombs]] of [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century, ''necklaces of prayer beads'' were occasionally distributed or sold by the bigger temples of the [[Sword Coast]] to the faithful of the congregation as a reward, or a way of enticing new followers."
