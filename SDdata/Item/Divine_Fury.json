        "mainbody": "ivine Fury was the name given to a number of magical katanas that appeared in northwest Faer√ªn circa 1372 DR.\nAlthough unconfirmed, in the account of Kaa Mihnd, these swords were forged from fallen stars that crashed into the square of a poor fishing village somewhere. Kaa Mihnd and the other villagers used these swords to rise up against their rich overlord and reclaim their ancestral land.\nThese katanas bore either a wide guard or a brown cloth wrapped around the lower blade.\nA Divine Fury was a +3 katana that inflicted electrical burns and could stun an opponent for a dozen seconds."
