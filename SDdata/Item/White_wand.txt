'''''White wands''''' were special [[magic item]]s given by [[Loviatar]], the Maiden of Pain, to followers who caused widespread pain and suffering.

==Powers==
Each individual who received a ''white wand'' experienced a mental communication as to their intended purpose. A ''white wand'' would melt into nothing if it was touched by someone other than the intended recipient. A ''white wand'' automatically absorbed the power from [[spell]]s cast at its carrier, dissolving into nothing when its [[magic]] was spent.

==History==
Loviatar usually granted a ''white wand'' to a member of her clergy, but occasionally she would gift one to individuals who caused a great deal of suffering, willingly or not, even if they did not worship her. Loviatar actually preferred to gift ''white wands'' to good-natured people who unknowingly caused immense suffering because of their actions, enjoying the strife and turmoil they would feel realizing they had spread her cause. Under this circumstance a ''white wand'' would actually emit a wicked laugh every time it was used.
