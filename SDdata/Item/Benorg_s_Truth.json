        "mainbody": "'''''Benorg's Truth''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[battleaxe]] laboriously forged by one of the many [[dwarven]] inhabitants of [[Dorn's Deep]].",
        "Description": "This axe was a magnificent work of craftsmanship, evident to any that looked upon it. Tiny [[Dethek|dwarven runes]] of power were etched along its surface, from which a soft blue glow emanated.",
        "Powers": "This weapon was a +''3 battleaxe''. In addition, anyone who wielded it was imbued with a greater sense of defense and there was a small chance that anyone who fought against it would be temporarily stunned.",
        "History": "''Benorg's Truth'' was last known to be in the possession of the dwarven hero [[Jamoth Stonetree]] and buried alongside him in the crypts of Dorn's Deep."
