        "mainbody": "Benorgs Truth was an enchanted battleaxe laboriously forged by one of the many dwarven inhabitants of Dorns Deep.\nThis axe was a magnificent work of craftsmanship, evident to any that looked upon it. Tiny dwarven runes of power were etched along its surface, from which a soft blue glow emanated.\nThis weapon was a +3 battleaxe. In addition, anyone who wielded it was imbued with a greater sense of defense and there was a small chance that anyone who fought against it would be temporarily stunned.\nBenorgs Truth was last known to be in the possession of the dwarven hero Jamoth Stonetree and buried alongside him in the crypts of Dorns Deep."
