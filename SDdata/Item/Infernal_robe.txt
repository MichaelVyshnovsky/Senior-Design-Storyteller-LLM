'''''Infernal robes''''' were [[enchanted]] [[robe]]s found in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The robe's magic offered the wearer resistance to fire, both mundane and magical, and granted them a magical protection similar to that of a ''+1'' enchantment. Once per day, it also allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[fire shield]]'' spell.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an ''infernal robe'' belonged to [[Mizora]], a [[devil]] who served Archduke [[Zariel]] of Avernus. She was to reward the magic robe to her contractee, [[Wyll Ravengard]], if he executed a runaway soldier of the [[Blood War]], in reality, the [[tiefling]] slave from [[Baldur's Gate]] named [[Karlach Cliffgate]].
