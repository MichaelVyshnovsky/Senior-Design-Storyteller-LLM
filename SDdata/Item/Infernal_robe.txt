Infernal robes were enchanted robes found in Avernus in the late 15 century DR.
The robes magic offered the wearer resistance to fire, both mundane and magical, and granted them a magical protection similar to that of a +1 enchantment. Once per day, it also allowed the wearer to cast the fire shield spell.
In the , an infernal robe belonged to Mizora, a devil who served Archduke Zariel of Avernus. She was to reward the magic robe to her contractee, Wyll Ravengard, if he executed a runaway soldier of the Blood War, in reality, the tiefling slave from Baldurs Gate named Karlach Cliffgate.
