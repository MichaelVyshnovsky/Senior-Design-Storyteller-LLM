A scarab of venom was an enchanted piece of jewelry that was favored by warriors of Set.
This item was a gemstone.
Warriors of Set would place the scarab of venom on the hilts of their swords. The magic of the scarab would then coat the blade with poison that caused excrutiating pain and often killed within minutes. The scarab of venom could be used twice per day and the venom lasted for several minutes before evaporating.
