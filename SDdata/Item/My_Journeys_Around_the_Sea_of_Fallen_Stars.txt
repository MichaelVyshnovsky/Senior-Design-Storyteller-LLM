'''''My Journeys Around the Sea of Fallen Stars''''' was a book written by [[Nelve Harssad]] of [[Tsurlagol]], first published in the [[1298 DR|Year of the Pointed Bone, 1298 DR]],{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|5}} and reprinted in the [[1332 DR|Year of the Sword and Stars, 1332 DR]].<ref group="note">The novel ''[[Spellfire (novel)|Spellfire]]'' dates the above quote and ''My Journeys Around the Sea of Fallen Stars'' to the "Year of the Sword and Stars" (with no [[Dalereckoning]] year). However, "The Leaves of Learning" Web Enhancement for ''[[Faiths and Pantheons]]'' says it was published in the much-earlier 1298 DR. Assuming both are correct, the book may have been reprinted or copied in the later year.

The book was in three volumes.

Around [[1372 DR]], a copy could be found in the Tower of Tomes of the [[Leaves of Learning]], a temple to [[Oghma]] in [[Deepingdale]].{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}}<ref group="note">''The Candlekeep Collection'' web article is contradictory on possession of the original tome, indicating that the original is stored in Candlekeep in the list of books by title, but the opposite in the list of books by author.
