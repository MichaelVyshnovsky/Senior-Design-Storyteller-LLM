        "mainbody": "Eyes of the Sun were enchanted kama created by monks of the Order of the Sun Soul sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nEyes of the Sun were always warm to the touch and were enhanced with a simple +3 enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielders hand towards the target. Additionally, the weapon burned the targets with acid and fire with each slash.\nIt was unknown when the first Eye of the Sun was created, but the kama bore markings of the Sun Souls. By the late 14 century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands."
