        "mainbody": "'''''Eyes of the Sun''''' were [[enchanted]] [[kama]] created by [[monk]]s of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Eyes of the Sun'' were always warm to the touch and were enhanced with a simple ''+3'' enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the weapon burned the targets with [[acid]] and fire with each slash.",
        "History": "It was unknown when the first ''Eye of the Sun'' was created, but the kama bore markings of the Sun Souls. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands."
