        "mainbody": "A '''moonblade''' was a hereditary magical [[longsword]] passed down in [[elf]] lineages.<ref>DMG5e p. 217-218",
        "Description": "Moonblades were named in part because of the [[moonstone]]s found in the [[wikipedia:pommel|pommel]] of each sword but also for the [[moon elves]] that wielded them, with the sole exception of the [[half-elf]] [[assassin]], [[Arilyn Moonblade]]. According to [[Ethlando]], the [[mage]] responsible for conception and creation of the largest collection of moonblades, the other elves, such as [[green elves|sylvan elves]] and [[gold elves|sun elves]] were not prohibited from claiming a blade, it was just highly unlikely.",
        "Abilities": "Each wielder contributed a power to the sword, which would be absorbed through the moonstone in the blade's pommel. However, the wielder could not be separated from the sword for any length of time and expect to live. Each moonblade was unique, as were the powers given to them.",
        "History": "Each moonblade was tied to the elven bloodline that first claimed the blade and was passed from descendant to descendant until there were no more worthy heirs. Every elf in the family had a choice to attempt to bond with the blade. If the elf chose to bond with the blade, they were subjected to the moonblade's bladerite in which the sword judged the character of the prospective wielder. The wielder was not only judged by his own character but also by the characters of all its previous wielders. With each new wielder the blade became harder to obtain by the next user. Any elf judged unworthy by the blade was subjected to the consequences of the bladerite, which usually resulted in immediate death by arcane fire. A claimed blade never bonded with an elf that did not carry the bloodline of the original family, making the blade's magics useless in the hands of anyone else.\n\nThe wielders of the moonblades also paid a cost — when they died, their life essence entered the moonblade, to become the source of its magic. Until the moonblade's purpose was fulfilled, the passage to [[Arvandor]] was delayed for all of the elven souls within.\n\nThe process of crafting a moonblade could not be adequately described — no more than a melody could be conveyed with mere words.",
        "Notable Moonblades": "[[File:Elaith craulnober-eladrin.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Elaith and the ''Craulnober moonblade''.'']]\n* ''[[Arilyn's moonblade]]'', wielded by [[Arilyn Moonblade]]. It had many different powers, most notably the ''elfshadow'' and ''elfgate'' abilities.\n* The ''[[Craulnober moonblade]]'' was in the possession of [[Elaith Craulnober]] as of the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], even after it rejected him. He had a son by Amnestria Moonflower, but never knew of his son's existence.  When he had a daughter, [[Azariah Craulnober|Azariah]], he assumed she became the heir to the moonblade and he raised and provided for her so she might one day draw the blade.  However his firstborn, a son he never knew he had, may in fact be the true heir to the moonblade, especially since the child's mother Amnestria's moonblade was inherited by Arilyn Moonblade instead.\n* ''[[Darkmoon (moonblade)|Darkmoon]]'', originally claimed by the [[Starym]] clan. The moonblade was corrupted by [[Illitran Starym]] with the assistance of [[Moander]], god of corruption and decay. The blade is also known as Bladeshee for it's ''[[mythal ghost]]'s'' ability to cast the spell [[Wail of the Banshee]].\n* ''[[Ellaquin Shadowsteel]]'s moonblade'', the weapon wielded by one of the heroes of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], after the events that involved ''[[Glaysa's poniard]]'' returning to the [[Prime Material plane]].{{Cite polyhedron/141/WF 2000 in Review|7}}\n* ''[[King's Blade]]'' (also called the ''King's Sword''), the most powerful elven moonblades and wielded by the Ruler of [[Evermeet]]. The sword was wielded by [[Lamruil Moonflower|Prince Lamruil Moonflower]] the youngest son of [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Queen Amlaruil Moonflower]]. The previous wielder was [[Zaor Moonflower|King Zaor Moonflower]].\n* ''[[Thoerl]]'', the moonblade of the [[moon elf]] House [[Silverspear]].\n* ''[[Xan's moonblade]]'', wielded by [[Xan]]. This particular moonblade protected the wielder from fire and improved his personal defense."
