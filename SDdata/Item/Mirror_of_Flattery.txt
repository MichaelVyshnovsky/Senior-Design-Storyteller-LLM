The Mirror of Flattery was an enchanted mirror from Ancient Imaskar, unearthed by Ambuchar Devayams slaves during their excavations in Solon.
It was a small hand-held mirror.
By looking through the mirror, one would be shown any scene they wished to see. Unfortunately, it always attempted to please its holder, even at the risk of misrepresentation. Someone preparing an ambush would instead be shown sleeping, for instance.
