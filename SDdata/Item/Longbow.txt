A '''longbow''' is a two-handed, martial ranged weapon of the [[bow]] family.

==Description==
The longbow is a flexible shaft of wood (or horn or bone) about {{SIrange|4|6|ft}} long with the ends connected by a [[bowstring]] that was a little shorter than the shaft, causing the wood to bend and keep the string under tension. For a composite longbow, the shaft is made from laminated materials (again, horn, wood or bone) and fashioned with a recurve, meaning the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.

It was commonly known that it took about five years of training to become proficient at the use of the longbow.

==Weaponology==
The length of a longbow can vary up to about the height of the archer but it quickly becomes unwieldy, getting caught on things or tripping the user. Composite bows are stronger than normal bows and therefore can translate more of the archer's strength into range and damage. Bows require two hands to fire and a good amount of practice in order to hit a target. Therefore, the longbow is considered a martial weapon. You may not use a longbow while mounted, however you may use a composite longbow from the back of a mount.

==History==
The longbow seems to have been invented by the [[elves]].

==Varieties==
; [[Aquatic longbow]] : A weapon favored by the [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] with a kelp string.
