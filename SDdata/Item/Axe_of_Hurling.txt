A group of adventurers heading to [[Menzoberranzan]] acquired the weapon at the second level of the [[Temple of Dumathoin]]. After heading down to the lowest level of the temple, they sacrificed a [[diamond]] to an enchanted fountain of healing power.

They were met by the spirit of the fountain, which told them that the spirit of [[Dorn Black Axe]] had awoken, and requested an audience with them.

Dorn retold his story of battling with the [[drow]] alongside kin in the [[Cavern of Cloven Heads]]. His clan were forced from their home, and he was slain in battle. He urged them to take up his fight, and avenge [[Clan Black Axe]]. Here, Dorn bestowed upon the party the magical returning axe, the ''Axe of Hurling''.

After leaving the Temple of Dumathoin, the adventurers went further into the drow territory of the [[Underdark]]. They finally reached the city of Menzoberranzan, and cut down many dark elves.

[[Isundoun Impaerlath]], a [[dwarven]] blacksmith from [[Saerloon]], was known for forging these weapons.
