'''Housebreaker harnesses''', known in [[thieves' cant]] as a '''spider''',
{{Quote|An interesting contraption for one who cannot ''[[levitate]]''...|[[Jarlaxle]] commenting on the harness's utility in climbing}}

==Description==
Housebreaker harnesses consisted of a number of leather straps that linked together, one to be hooked around each thigh and over each shoulder, as well as one broad leather strap that was to be secured around the waist. A number of hooks, safety clips, or adjustable clamps were attached to these belts. Though other designs instead incorporated up to eight or more additional straps of varied length, usually measuring no more than {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}}, at the end of which would be small metal rings.

With both designs a thief could affix all manner of tools to the attachments, though their primary purpose was for having [[rope]] attach to them or for tether lines. This eliminated the threat of falling for a thief, allowed them to secure themselves to walls, and gave them free use of their hands for other tasks, such as [[lockpicks|lockpicking]], [[glass cutter|cutting glass]], checking for traps, etc.

A housebreaker harnesses could equally be worn with ease over clothing or [[leather armor]].
