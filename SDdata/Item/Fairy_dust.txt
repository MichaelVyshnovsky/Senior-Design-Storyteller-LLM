'''''Fairy dust''''' was a naturally-occurring substance that possessed magical properties.

==Description==
''Fairy dust'' was a life byproduct of various [[fey]] creatures like [[sprite]]s. It was dust made by the fey from their own shed hair and skin. The fine substance could be identified by its soft golden radiance in the darkness, yet it was almost invisible, and it sparkled in normal light. In moonlight, the dust shimmered with a silvery sheen.

==Powers==
''Fairy dust'' was given to their friends and allies as a gift by the fey. It had many well-documented uses in magic, including boosting the power of [[spell]]s. An ounce of ''fairy dust'' could be added as an additional material component when casting spells of the [[illusion]] school to boost their effectiveness. This led to some of the fairy species being hunted to the brink of extinction in [[Thay]]. [[Transmutation]] spells received a similar boost from an ounce of the substance â€“ it doubled the spells' duration.

==Rumors & Legends==
The origin of ''fairy dust'' had been a subject of scholarly debate. Some scholars believed that it was made from the first spring blossoming of forest flowers, while others argued that it was powdered cocoons of a rare [[moth]] species that bred in the spring.
