Blueshine was a special magical quality that could be applied to metal armor, giving it a blue-black color and prevented it from being tarnished, becoming rusty, or being damaged by acid. It also allowed its wearer to hide significantly more easily.
This quality was acquired by a series of actions in which the armor was heated, submersed in water and bathed in specific arcane solutions. The specially enchanted liquids were composed of a potion of sweetwater that was mixed distilled cockatrice feathers and drops of blood taken from a variety of species of dragons.
Blueshine enchantment was considered to be the best protection for armor when fighting giant slugs.
The formulation to enhance a suit of armor as blueshine had been practices by the dwarves of Faer√ªn for centuries prior to the Era of Upheaval. It involved the stainless chant as one of its steps.
During the 14 century DR, the Calishite wizard Toth created a spell that mimicked the process that created the blueshine effect. For his effects, he was soon killed by the Red Wizards of Thay.
