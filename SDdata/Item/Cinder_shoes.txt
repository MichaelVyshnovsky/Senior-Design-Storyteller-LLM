'''''Cinder shoes''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[boots]] that allowed the wearer to accumulate heat.
==Powers==
''Cinder shoes'' were a pair of ordinary-looking [[leather]] boots covered in numerous scorch marks that, surprisingly, did not damage the leather. This was due to the boots' enchantment that allowed them to absorb mundane and magical fire every time the wearer dealt fire damage to their opponents. This stored heat boosted the wearer's flame damage but, if held for too long, hurt the wearer with the magic fire from the inside.
==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''cinder shoes'' belonged to the [[orog]] [[Blurg]] of the [[Society of Brilliance]], during his stay within a friendly [[myconid]] colony of the [[Ebonlake Grotto]] in the [[Underdark]].
