A ring of spell storing was a magic ring that stored a number of spells.
As the name suggested, a ring of spell storing stored spells for later use. To store a spell, the spellcaster simply cast the spell as normal, but targeted to the ring, and the spell remained intact within it. The spell could then be released and fully cast by anyone who wore the ring. This allowed a spellcaster to prepare a spell for a non-spellcaster, or cast a spell from a scroll into the ring for later use. Multiple spellcasters, and both arcane and divine casters, could have spells in a single ring of spell storing.
Different spells were stored according to the type of ring. A minor ring of spell storing stored only a few spells, such as either three simple spells, or one minor spell and two simple spells. A standard ring of spell storing stored more spells and those of intermediate power, and a major ring of spell storing stored far more spells and those only a master mage could typically cast.
Along with the skill to craft magic rings, a creator required the imbue with spell ability spell.
In the Year of the Prince, 1358 DR, Khelben Arunsun lent a ring of spell storing to Kyriani and Onyx the Invincible to use against the villains Aviss and Fellandar marauding around Waterdeep. Kyriani placed a fireball in the ring, and Onyx used it to surprise Aviss and Fellandar, who had not expected the dwarf to use magic against them.
