Catstep boots were a variety of enchanted boots that imparted upon their wearer innate qualities associated with cats.
When worn, these boots improved the acrobatic and athletic qualities of their wearer. They also dampened the harm that would normally be inflicted from falling great heights.
In the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers in Waterdeep discovered a pair of catstep boots among the belongings of a small group of thieves in the Dock Ward.
