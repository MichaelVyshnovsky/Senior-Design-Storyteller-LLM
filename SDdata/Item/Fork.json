        "mainbody": "Forks were a kind of handheld utensil used in cooking and eating, widely appreciated for their ability to stab and hold onto things.\nCommon, everyday forks were used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside spoons and knives. They had at least two tines (any fewer and they would simply be a skewer) and usually topped out at four. Cheap ones were commonly made from brass, while fancier ones used silver.\nThe much larger pitchfork was used for farm work, and fully-fledged polearms such as tridents, fauchards, and military forks took the idea to its logical conclusion. By comparison, the planar fork was named for its shape, not its stabbing ability."
