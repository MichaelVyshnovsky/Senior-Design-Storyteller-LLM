        "Description": "Common, everyday forks were used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside [[spoon]]s and [[knives]]. They had at least two tines (any fewer and they would simply be a [[skewer]]) and usually topped out at four. Cheap ones were commonly made from [[brass]], while fancier ones used [[silver]].\n\nThe much larger [[pitchfork]] was used for farm work, and fully-fledged [[polearm]]s such as [[trident]]s, [[fauchard]]s, and [[military fork]]s took the idea to its logical conclusion. By comparison, the ''[[planar fork]]'' was named for its shape, not its stabbing ability."
