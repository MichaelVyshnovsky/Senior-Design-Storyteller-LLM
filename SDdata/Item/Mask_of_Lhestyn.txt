The mask of Lhestyn was a magical item unique to Waterdeep.
The mask of Lhestyn was an elegant veil made of white silk. It was bejeweled and a string of black pearls secured the veil across the brow.
This magical item bestowed upon its wearer the same magical effects as both a hat of disguise and a medallion of thoughts.
It was created by Shilarn Silmaeril as a gift to her daughter Lhestyn. Lhestyn used the mask to infiltrate the Shadow Thieves with the goal of investigating the guilds activities. After successfully exposing the guild, the mask then became a symbol in Waterdeep. Waterdhavians look upon the mask as a symbol of justice. When Zelphar Arunsun, Lhestyns husband, died in , the mask vanished. Many suspected he was murdered by the Shadow Thieves however, the guild continued to search for the missing mask.
