'''Udderfish venom''' was a [[poison]] extracted from the fangs or spines of the [[udderfish]]. It was harvested by [[pirate]]s from the [[Nelanther Isles]] and sold to merchants in [[Skullport]] and [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This substance was a thick, whitish liquid that tasted vaguely sweet. It could be mixed with water or alcohol and still retain its potency. A single dose typically cost 400 gp.

==Effects==
A victim that imbibed this poison (and did not manage to resist it) was not likely to notice the effects at first, perhaps passing it off as a headache or mild body aches, but soon they felt as if they had taken a real beating or been stepped on by a [[giant]].

==Notable Users==
[[Elsk Thavarask]], the proprietor of the [[Missing Minotaur]] tavern in [[Everlund]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], was known to use this substance to quiet down extremely rowdy customers. He would also sell it to people he trusted.
