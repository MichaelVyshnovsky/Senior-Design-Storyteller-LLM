The '''''Book of Lore''''' was a magical tome that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
The binding of this book was red leather from an unknown creature.

==Powers==
The book appeared small, but no matter how many times its pages were turned, one page always remained. Each page was decorated with beautiful calligraphy. Reading the book for a week granted the reader knowledge similar to the effects of a [[legend lore|''legend lore'']] spell based on what they read.
