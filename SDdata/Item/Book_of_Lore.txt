The Book of Lore was a magical tome that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The binding of this book was red leather from an unknown creature.
The book appeared small, but no matter how many times its pages were turned, one page always remained. Each page was decorated with beautiful calligraphy. Reading the book for a week granted the reader knowledge similar to the effects of a legend lore spell based on what they read.
