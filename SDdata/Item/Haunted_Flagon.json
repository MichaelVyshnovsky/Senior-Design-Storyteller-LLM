        "mainbody": "The Haunted Flagon was an artifact that once was the Magister Velgorn Kataclath. At the end of his tenure, he became the Haunted Flagon after Mystras Choice. It continued to circulate as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe flagon was a metal mug that curved like a bulls horn, with a tip that flared out.\nThough a flagon, Velgorn Kataclath was actually quite satisfied with his fate, giving no indication of a pressing need to find another.\nIn a radius of  around the Haunted Flagon, an area of wild magic responded in bizarre ways to magic passing through it. Amongst other possibilities, it could affect the area around it with a reverse gravity effect that endured for four minutes, surround itself with rings of green flame that clung to all that bore an enchantment, but which only burnt undead, convert all vegetable matter around it into shriekers or any nonliving biological matter if there was no vegetable matter, teleport without error all (other) metal objects within its area of influence into a random spot within , make the air shimmer with faerie fire-like radiance, which then contracted to envelop only living beings for two minutes whether they remained inside its field or not, cause some nonliving, unattended object in the field to sink halfway into the ground permanently, make all wood and stone in the field permanently transparent, as per glassee. Other effects could be more dangerous the flagon could also summon up to four monsters, impossible to know in advance, to attack everyone within sight until slain it could also make all enchanted wares within the field glow a deep blue that faded to violet, inactivating them for six hours. However, the most dangerous outcome of it having magic cast in its area was that it could make all small, unattended objects in the area rise and spin into a whirlstorm for three minutes, dealing real, lethal damage to anyone within the area.\nUnlike many sentient artifacts, the Haunted Flagon did not communicate. It could, however, fly with unmatched nimbleness, at a pace slightly faster than a typical mans walk. It could also make other motions, such as tapping, or spinning, and it was known to have some manner of perceiving the world around it.\nAfter being faced with Mystras Choice, Velgorn Kataclath decided to promote magic as a source of wonder and amazement Mystra converted him into the Haunted Flagon. Since then, the Haunted Flagon had been bought by merchants looking for a conversation piece, and then resold as it ran their patiences thin."
