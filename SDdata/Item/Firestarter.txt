'''Firestarters''' were useful items that could be found in arid [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Description==
A firestarter was a small cylindrical mechanical device used to create fire. They were approximately {{SI|4|"|c|long=yes}} long and weighed {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}. A full firestarter held a few ounces of volatile [[liquid star]] [[oil]] that could be used up to a hundred times before needing to be refilled.

==Usage==
The liquid star oil was ignited by a [[flint]] mechanism held within the firestarter. This item was particularly useful in the dry Land of Fate where kindling was often hard to find. [[Tabacco]] smokers also used them to light their [[water pipe]]s. These items were relatively common throughout the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] and [[Muluk]] but were rarely seen elsewhere in Zakhara.

==History==
The first firestarter was invented during the 1360s [[DR]] by a team of clever [[sage]]s at the university in [[Qadib]]. A simple firestarter usually sold for 100–400 [[gp]] in Qadib, but that price would increase drastically based upon the decoration and kind of material used during its construction and the firestarter's proximity to Qadib.
