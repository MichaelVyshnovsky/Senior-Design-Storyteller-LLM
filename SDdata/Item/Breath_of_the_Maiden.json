        "mainbody": "'''''Breaths of the Maiden''''' were mysterious [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]]s found on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "These swords had a distinct bold design and marks indicating their maker or origins.",
        "Powers": "Each of the blades was ensorcelled with a ''+1'' enchantment, and upon a successful cut, it had a chance of withering the target's physique.",
        "History": "Truly mysterious weapons, ''Breaths of the Maiden'' were all believed to have originated from the same source, judging by markings left on each of these blades. Despite the markings being boldly displayed, sages were at a loss when researching their meaning. Not a single known wielder of a ''Breath of the Maiden'' knew or offered any insight on the weapon's origins nor disclosed how they came to possess such a strange item.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one such blade was in the hands of one of Lord [[Temar]]'s men stationed in his estate in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Blacklake District]]."
