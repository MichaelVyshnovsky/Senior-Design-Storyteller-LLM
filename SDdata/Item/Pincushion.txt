'''Pincushions''' were a type of sewing equipment commonly used by seamstresses to hold [[pin (sewing)|pins]] and [[sewing needle]]s.

==Notable Users==
* [[Foxilon Cardluck]] used pincushions when tailoring a new outfit for his friend [[Priam Agrivar]].<ref>{{Cite comic/Jasmine|1-2}}
* The [[night hag]] coven of [[Auntie Pinch]], [[Auntie Pillage]], and [[Auntie Plunder]] kept a pincushion in their ''[[demiplane]]'' abode.

==Trivia==
Some in the Realms would refer to bodies pierced with a profuse number of [[arrow]]s as resembling a pincushion.
