==History==
Plum prosecco found some controversial popularity in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The drink was served in various establishments in the city, including the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. The drink was loved by some and hated by others. The disdain for plum prosecco also made its way into the [[broadsheet]]s in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, being called a "scourge" by a certain connoisseur on the pages of the ''Baldur's Mouth''.
