        "Description": "The light hammer was a small [[sledge hammer]], usually with a haft made of wood about one and a half feet long (45cm). Other versions of this weapon added a [[pick]] on the back of the hammer head. An average light hammer cost 1gp and weighed 2lbs (0.9kg).",
        "Weaponology": "Classified as a light weapon, the light hammer could be used while grappling. Some training was required to use this weapon, especially for throwing, therefore it was considered a martial weapon. Normal maximum range of a light hammer was 100ft (30m).",
        "Realmslore": "Light hammers were favored by [[dwarves]].",
        "Notable light hammers": "{{Sectstub}}",
        "Other Editions": "The 1st edition represents the light hammer (called just \"hammer\") as both a melee and hurled weapon. The 2nd edition presents the \"hammer\" only as a missile weapon."
