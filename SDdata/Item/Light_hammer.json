        "mainbody": "light hammer was a light, martial melee weapon of the hammer family that could be used as a ranged weapon.\nThe light hammer was a small sledge hammer, usually with a haft made of wood about one and a half feet long (45cm). Other versions of this weapon added a pick on the back of the hammer head. An average light hammer cost 1gp and weighed 2lbs (0.9kg).\nClassified as a light weapon, the light hammer could be used while grappling. Some training was required to use this weapon, especially for throwing, therefore it was considered a martial weapon. Normal maximum range of a light hammer was 100ft (30m).\nLight hammers were favored by dwarves.\nThe 1st edition represents the light hammer (called just \"hammer\") as both a melee and hurled weapon. The 2nd edition presents the \"hammer\" only as a missile weapon."
