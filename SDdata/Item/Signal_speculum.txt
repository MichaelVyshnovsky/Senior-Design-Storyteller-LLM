They were created by wizards and clerics but could be used by anybody.
Signal specula were magic items associated with the drow. They used it as signaling devices but also to treat chilled, wounded, or otherwise immobilized people with warmth, to warm drinks or limbs, or warm torn or cramped muscles.
