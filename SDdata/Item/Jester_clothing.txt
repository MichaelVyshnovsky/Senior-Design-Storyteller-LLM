Jester clothing was a costume in the Realms popular among bards and, more specifically, jesters.
A typical jesters outfit included white gloves, a three-cornered hat with bells, a star-shaped collar with bells, a poofy satin shirt, bright stockings, large shoes, and baggy pantaloons.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 25 gold pieces for the complete outfit.
* Jesters outfits were favored by bards and jesters.
