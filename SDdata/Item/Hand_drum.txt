A hand drum, sometimes called hand-drum, was a percussion musical instrument.
Hand drums consisted of double-headed drums with a shoulder strap along their sides. They were used by bards either as rhythmic instruments to accompany ensembles or by themselves as alarms to alert of danger or to mark narrative campfire tales.
