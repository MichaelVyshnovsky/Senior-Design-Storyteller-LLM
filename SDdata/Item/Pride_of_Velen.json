        "Description": "Pride of Velen was an impressive [[wild rice]] dish served on a large platter, shaped to resemble castle battlements. The rice segregated several foods from each other. On one side were [[snail]]s in [[brandy]] and [[lemon]] sauce, on the other [[turkey]] meat in a decadent white [[wine]] sauce with a light flavor of [[onion]], and cooked [[sword (vegetable)|swords]] and [[mushroom]]s.",
        "History": "As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Pride of Velen could be found on the menu at [[Blackthorn's Brew]], a [[festhall]] on the [[Captain's Cliff]] in Velen. The dish was among the notable foods included in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s published guide to [[Amn]] and Tethyr."
