        "mainbody": "Potions of heroism were a type of potion that instilled in people a surge of vitality and resilience.\nThe liquid of this potion had a blue complexion. It seemed to continually bubble and steam as though it were boiling. And it had a bitter taste to it.\nWhen quaffed this potion allowed individuals to fight as though they were more sturdy and experienced combatants, able to withstand greater harm. Some later iterations of the potion were described as having an effect similar to the spell bless.\nIn earlier eras, this potion was only effective on those who had the profession of a fighter or warrior. Later iterations of the potion were usable by people from all walks of life.\nOne special component that was often used in constructing one of these potions was the heart of a lion or similar big cat. Crushed lapis lazuli was also a commonly used ingredient. Another recipe for such potion required a sublimate of pegasus feathers.\n* Bruenor Battlehammer\n* Giogioni Wyvernspur\n* Makbulla bint Dalmar\n* Mol\n* Ugreth"
