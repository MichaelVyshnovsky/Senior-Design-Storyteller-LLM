The '''''Assad Head''''' was a sculpture found in the [[Assad Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
This {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall figure was made of sandstone and resembled a lion's head. Its eyes were closed and the mouth was open.

==Rumors and Legends==
Many locals believed the ''Assad Head'' would speak if certain events took place. Some even claimed that the head was facing a different direction than when they saw it from the previous night.

Some believed that the statue was once an [[Living idol|idol]] worshiped by isolated desert tribes. The statue was believed to have mysteriously followed the tribesmen into civilization once they became [[Zakharan pantheon|Enlightened]]. Once exposed to the [[Law of the Loregiver]], the statue was said to have become Enlightened itself.
