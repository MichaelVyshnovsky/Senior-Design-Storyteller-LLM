        "Abilities": "After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], her swords were noted to be regular ''hornblades +3''.

        "Uses": "Though Mielikki was skilled in fighting with her ''Hornblades'', she rarely actually used them, as she did not engage in melee often, and favored her fists when she did. She would rather rely on her own skills and magic and her [[longbow]], named ''[[Hartsong]]''.\n\nShe sometimes lent these weapons to mortal [[ranger]]s who embarked on great quests on her behalf.\n\nBased on the ''Hornblades'', the scimitar was the favored weapon of Mielikkian [[cleric]]s."
