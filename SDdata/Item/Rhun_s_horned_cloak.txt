Rhuns Horned Cloak, which was also simply called a horned cloak, was an enchanted cloak that provided numerous benefits to its wearer.
This hooded cloak was dark brown. A pair of large horns protruded from the hood. Some of these cloaks came with a prehensile tail at the bottom that the wearer could control mentally and use as a weapon. 
Anyone wearing this cloak could pass without trace at will. The cloak also acted like a cloak of protection, making it more difficult for enemies to strike the wearer. 
The cloak allowed the wearer to shapechange into a strong bull up to six times per day. There was a slight chance with each passing minute that the cloak would vanish while the wearer was in bull form, trapping them that way. 
Some variations of these cloaks had face masks that provided the gift of infravision to the wearer.
