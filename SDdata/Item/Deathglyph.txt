A '''''deathglyph''''' was perhaps the most powerful [[handglyph]] weapon used by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]], capable of instantly killing an enemy.

==Powers==
''Deathglyphs'' were special medallions [[enchanted]] to hold the ''[[power word, kill]]'' [[spell]]. The wielder simply needed to face the medallion toward an enemy and utter the [[command word]] to unleash the lethal power of the spell.

These handglyphs could not be recharged.
