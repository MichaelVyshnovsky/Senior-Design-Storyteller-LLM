A '''''rod of generalship''''' was a rare [[enchanted]] [[rod]] that inspired soldiers.

==Description==
The rod measured {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} long and was made from pure [[gold]]. It was decoratd with valuable stones such as [[diamond]]s, [[rubies]], and [[pearl]]s.

==Powers==
When carried into battle and raised overhead by the wielder, the ''rod of generalship'' boosted friendly soldiers' combat skills within {{SI|600|ft|long=yes}}, making them more likely to successfully strike and harm enemies, while also making them more difficult to be hit themselves. The rod also boosted a soldier's morale.

The rod could only be used once per day but its effects lasted for 30â€”120 minutes.

==History==
Three of these rods were known to exist. They were favored by [[priest]]s of [[Horus-Re]], [[Anhur]], and [[Hoar|Assuran of the Three Thunders]].
