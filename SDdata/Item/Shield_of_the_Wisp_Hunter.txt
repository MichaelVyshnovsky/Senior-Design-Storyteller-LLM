Shields of the Wisp Hunter were enchanted bucklers originally created by a legendary gnomish hero, Soggy Nurkel, some years before the late 14 century DR.
Shields of the Wisp Hunter possessed a +2 defensive enchantment and granted the wielder limited resistance to electricity.
According to legends, long before the , Soggy Nurkel, still a mere child, got lost in swamplands while chasing some toads around. The area was clouded in fog, and the child followed the lights that turned out to be will-o-wisps. Somehow Soggy managed to weave a magic shield out of swamp reeds and used it to crush will-o-wisps as the gnome snuck around the bog. Later, annual festivals were held to celebrate Soggy Nurkels life that lasted at least into the late 14 century DR. Making a copy shields of the Wisp Hunter was a part of the festival, and many of these magic items had been created over the years.
