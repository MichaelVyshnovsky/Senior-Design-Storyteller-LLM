'''''Shields of the Wisp Hunter''''' were [[enchanted]] [[buckler]]s originally created by a legendary [[gnome|gnomish]] hero, [[Soggy Nurkel]], some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Shields of the Wisp Hunter'' possessed a ''+2'' defensive enchantment and granted the wielder limited resistance to electricity.

==History==
According to legends, long before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Soggy Nurkel, still a mere child, got lost in swamplands while chasing some [[toad]]s around. The area was clouded in fog, and the child followed the lights that turned out to be [[will-o'-wisp]]s. Somehow Soggy managed to weave a magic shield out of swamp [[reed]]s and used it to crush will-o'-wisps as the gnome snuck around the bog. Later, annual festivals were held to celebrate Soggy Nurkel's life that lasted at least into the late 14{{th}} century DR. Making a copy ''shields of the Wisp Hunter'' was a part of the festival, and many of these magic items had been created over the years.
