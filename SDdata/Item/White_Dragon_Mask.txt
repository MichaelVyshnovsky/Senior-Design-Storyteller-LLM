The '''''White Dragon Mask''''' was one of the five ''[[dragon mask]]s'' that carried the blessings of [[Tiamat]] in the efforts of the reformed [[Cult of the Dragon]] to summon her to [[Toril]]. It was worn by [[Wyrmspeaker]] [[Varramzord]] for a time, before being lost to the cult.

==Description==
The ''White Dragon Mask'' had a polished white surface that was highlighted with specks of pale blue, and featured the cranial crest often associated with [[white dragon]]s.

==Powers==
The wearer of the ''White Dragon Mask'' gained a natural resistance to magical and mundane coldness, along with protection from physical harm. 
Whenever they became severely hurt in battle, any attack they made was imbued with magical cold energy, similar to that of a white dragon's [[dragon breath|breath]]. The wearer was also granted [[darkvision]] and [[blindsight]], along with an the understanding of the [[Draconic language]].

The main feature of the ''White Dragon Mask'', that was shared by all of the ''dragon masks'', was its ability to transform its wearer into a [[wyrmspeaker]]. These individuals were granted thought processes similar to those possessed by [[dragon]]s and granted minimal influence over their behaviors.

When two or more of the masks were brought together, they joined together as the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'', which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. Addition pieces of the five other ''dragon masks'' could later be added as well. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the [[ritual]] that could free Tiamat from the [[Nine Hells]].

==History==
As of the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the ''White Dragon Mask'' remained in the possession of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], originally bestowed upon Wyrmspeaker Varram by the cult's leader [[Severin Silrajin]]. The decision that Varram was made wyrmspeaker over his rival [[Wearer of Purple]] [[Talis|Talis the White]] caused some strife within the Dragon Cult's leadership.

At some point, the Varram and the ''White Dragon Mask'' made their way to the city of [[Neverwinter]]. When [[red dragon]]s assailed the city,{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}} following the death of one of the three dragon overlords of [[Tuern]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 4}} the mask was stolen by the [[Zhentarim]] agent [[Ratshadow]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 6}} and stashed at the [[Ulbrinter Villa]] in [[Waterdeep]].
