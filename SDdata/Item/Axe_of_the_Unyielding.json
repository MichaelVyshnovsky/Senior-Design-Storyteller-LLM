        "mainbody": "The Axe of the Unyielding was a powerful enchanted battleaxe.\nThe axe possessed a +3 enchantment and conveyed several boons upon its wielder. It both enhanced their natural defenses, and gave them a form of regeneration.\nAt one point the Axe of the Unyielding was in the possession of Glimred Heavyhand, an elder dwarf who was considered to be a hero among his people. Some time after Glimred disappeared beneath the Marching Mountains, the weapon came into the possession of the minotaur called Rock.\nAccording to the imp Cespenar, the Axe of the Unyielding could be further improved by a skilled and knowledgeable smith who happened to have the claw of a balor on hand."
