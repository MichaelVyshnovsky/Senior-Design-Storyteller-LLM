        "mainbody": "The '''''Rod of Law''''' was a powerful artifact of [[lawful]] nature, which was created by the [[vaati]] during the [[Dawn War]]. It was split during the war, which gave it the nickname of '''''Rod of Seven Parts'''''.{{Cite document/Elemental Evil Player's Companion|4}}",
        "Description": "The complete rod was {{SI|5|feet|long=yes)}} long rod whose width decreased from {{SI|2|inch|c|long=yes)}} across at the bottom, to a half-inch (1 centimeter) at the top. Due to their lawful nature, the fragments did not appear damaged but instead displayed intricate patterns of crystalline facets on each breaking point. The length of the fragments were {{SI|4|inch|c|long=yes)}}, {{SI|5|inch|c|long=yes)}}, {{SI|6|inch|c|long=yes)}}, {{SI|8|inch|c|long=yes)}}, {{SI|10|inch|c|long=yes)}}, {{SI|12|inch|c|long=yes)}}, and {{SI|15|inch|c|long=yes)}}.\n\nThe rod was unstable, and once it served its purpose it was known to scatter again.{{Cite dungeon/129/A Gathering of Winds|65}}",
        "Powers": {
            "Specific fragment powers": "*The {{SI|4|inches|c|long=yes}} tip possessed the ability to cast ''[[cure light wounds]]'' up to five times each day. Activation required the command word ''\"Ruat\"''.\n*The {{SI|5|inches|c|long=yes}} fragment could, once a day, create an effect similar to the ''[[slow]]'' spell for 23 minutes. Its command word was ''\"Coelum\"''.\n*The {{SI|6|inches|c|long=yes}} segment was able to cast ''[[haste]]'' once a day with a duration of 23 minutes. Notably, the wielder did not age rapidly from casting haste in this way. Its command word was ''\"Fiat\"''.\n*The {{SI|8|inches|c|long=yes}} fragment could cast ''[[gust of wind]]'' five times daily. Its command word was ''\"Justitia\"''.\n*The {{SI|10|inches|c|long=yes}} segment granted its user access to the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell once a day, lasting for 20 minutes. Its command word was ''\"Ecce\"''.\n*The {{SI|12|inches|c|long=yes}} section, the second largest, could cast ''[[hold monster]]'' once a day, with the effect lasting for 20 minutes. Its command word was ''\"Lex\"''.\n*The largest fragment, measuring {{SI|15|inches|c|long=yes}}, bestowed its owner with the ability to cast ''[[heal]]'' once per day. Its command word was ''\"Rex\"''. Being the largest fragment, it could not be used to locate other parts of the rod."

        "History": "The Rod of Law was forged by the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]] using the Soulforge of [[Moradin]] in [[Torzak-Belgirn]]. \n\nIt was used during the battle of the [[Fields of Pesh]] in order to banish [[Miska the Wolf-Spider]] to a prison in [[Pandemonium]]. When Miska was stabbed with the rod, the [[chaos]] from its blood shattered the rod into seven pieces and scattered them across the [[multiverse]].\n\nFragments of the rod would sometime surface here and there, often in times of great need. Among the [[aarakocra]], questing for these fragments was commonly seen as an honorable calling worthy of esteem.",
        "Trivia": "According to [[Khelben Arunsun]], the ''rod of seven parts'' was one of the few magic items in the multiverse to have the abilities of [[series magic]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/213/Series Magic|96}}"
