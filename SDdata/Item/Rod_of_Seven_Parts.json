        "mainbody": "The Rod of Law was a powerful artifact of lawful nature, which was created by the vaati during the Dawn War. It was split during the war, which gave it the nickname of Rod of Seven Parts.\nThe complete rod was  long rod whose width decreased from  across at the bottom, to a half-inch (1 centimeter) at the top. Due to their lawful nature, the fragments did not appear damaged but instead displayed intricate patterns of crystalline facets on each breaking point. The length of the fragments were , , , , , , and .\nThe rod was unstable, and once it served its purpose it was known to scatter again.\nEach fragment of the rod shared a common set of powers, in addition to having individual powers. In order to activate a segments power, the user had to focus on a fragment-specific command word.\n*Any non-lawful creature in possession of a fragment of the rod would see its worldview shifting towards a lawful disposition.\n*Any lawful creature holding a fragment of the rod could use it to locate the next larger segment.\nRestored to its complete form, the rod held the power to kill Miska the Wolf-Spider or to release it from its prison.\nthumb|right|200px|The first fragment of the Rod.\n*The  tip possessed the ability to cast cure light wounds up to five times each day. Activation required the command word \"Ruat\".\n*The  fragment could, once a day, create an effect similar to the slow spell for 23 minutes. Its command word was \"Coelum\".\n*The  segment was able to cast haste once a day with a duration of 23 minutes. Notably, the wielder did not age rapidly from casting haste in this way. Its command word was \"Fiat\".\n*The  fragment could cast gust of wind five times daily. Its command word was \"Justitia\".\n*The  segment granted its user access to the true seeing spell once a day, lasting for 20 minutes. Its command word was \"Ecce\".\n*The  section, the second largest, could cast hold monster once a day, with the effect lasting for 20 minutes. Its command word was \"Lex\".\n*The largest fragment, measuring , bestowed its owner with the ability to cast heal once per day. Its command word was \"Rex\". Being the largest fragment, it could not be used to locate other parts of the rod.\nThe Rod of Law was forged by the Wind Dukes of Aaqa using the Soulforge of Moradin in Torzak-Belgirn. \nIt was used during the battle of the Fields of Pesh in order to banish Miska the Wolf-Spider to a prison in Pandemonium. When Miska was stabbed with the rod, the chaos from its blood shattered the rod into seven pieces and scattered them across the multiverse.\nFragments of the rod would sometime surface here and there, often in times of great need. Among the aarakocra, questing for these fragments was commonly seen as an honorable calling worthy of esteem.\nAccording to Khelben Arunsun, the rod of seven parts was one of the few magic items in the multiverse to have the abilities of series magic."
