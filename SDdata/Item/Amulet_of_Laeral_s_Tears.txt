'''''Amulets of Laeral's tears''''' were named after the famed [[sorceress]], [[Laeral Silverhand]]. They temporarily bestowed greater health upon those who wore the amulet against their skin.

A variant of these amulets, known as an '''''Amulet of Dark Blessing''''', were found among the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] and besides their appearance they functioned identically.

==Description==
Strung along these amulets were soft, brittle, and colorless fancy stone crystals known as [[Laeral's tears]]. They were often large and kept a glossy, magnificent finish. The Underdark-wrought ''Amulets of Dark Blessing'' were crafted using a single iridescent black gemstone, however.

After being expended, both versions of the amulet would crumble to dust.

==Powers==
Whilst worn next to the skin the amulet bestowed a temporary increase to one's health. However, once this bonus health had been eroded (via injury) then the amulet crumbled into worthless dust.

==History==
The [[Witches of Rashemen]] used to craft these amulets using many large colorless stones.

==Appearances==
* ''[[City of the Spider Queen]]'' (''amulets of dark blessing'')
