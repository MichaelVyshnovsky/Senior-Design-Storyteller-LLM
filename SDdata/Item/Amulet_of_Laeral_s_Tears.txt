Amulets of Laerals tears were named after the famed sorceress, Laeral Silverhand. They temporarily bestowed greater health upon those who wore the amulet against their skin.
A variant of these amulets, known as an Amulet of Dark Blessing, were found among the drow of the Underdark and besides their appearance they functioned identically.
Strung along these amulets were soft, brittle, and colorless fancy stone crystals known as Laerals tears. They were often large and kept a glossy, magnificent finish. The Underdark-wrought Amulets of Dark Blessing were crafted using a single iridescent black gemstone, however.
After being expended, both versions of the amulet would crumble to dust.
Whilst worn next to the skin the amulet bestowed a temporary increase to ones health. However, once this bonus health had been eroded (via injury) then the amulet crumbled into worthless dust.
The Witches of Rashemen used to craft these amulets using many large colorless stones.
