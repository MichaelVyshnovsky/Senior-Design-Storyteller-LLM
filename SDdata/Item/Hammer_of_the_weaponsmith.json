        "mainbody": "The hammer of the weaponsmith was an enchanted hammer, used by the best craftsmen of the ancient Myth Drannor.\nThe hammer of the weaponsmith was a small but heavy tool.\nThis magic hammer was enchanted to dramatically improve the wielders crafting and weaponsmithing skills when working with metal.\nThe tongs of the armorer, along with the hammer of the weaponsmith, were placed on display within the Artisans Hall within the Crypt of Rothilion. The magic tools could be found in the Smiths Alcove to the left from the entrance to the tomb. The Crypt of Rothilion was sealed before the advent of hte Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor. The tomb remained undisturbed until it was unsealed in 1369 DR buring the Cult of the Dragons attempts to take over the pool of radiance within the ruined City of Song."
