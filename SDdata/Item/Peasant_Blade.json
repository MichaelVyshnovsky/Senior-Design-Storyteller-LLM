        "mainbody": "'''''Peasant Blades''''' were [[enchanted]] [[kama]] created to be used as weapons rather than tools of the trade.",
        "Powers": "''Peasant Blade'' was enhanced with a simple ''+3'' enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the weapon significantly boosted the wielder's constitution.",
        "History": "Unsurprisingly, ''Peasant Blades'' were once tools used by peasants in the fields, later adapted to be used in battle because they were forbidden from wielding [[sword]]s. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands."
