'''''Heirs of Osiris''''' were [[enchanted]] [[light flail]]s that were said to have [[divine]] origin.

==Powers==
''Heirs of Osiris'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment. However, when wielded against [[undead]] creatures, the flail effectively became a powerful ''+4'' enchanted weapon.

==History==
These magic [[flail]]s were first seen in the [[Old Empires]]. However, their history was mostly unknown to inhabitants of [[Faerûn]]. [[Sage]]s believed that the very first ''Heirs of Osiris'' was wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Osiris]] himself during the [[Orcgate Wars]]. As the deity was slain, the original ''Heirs of Osiris'' shattered into countless pieces. When Osiris was returned to life, each shard of the original divine weapon regenerated into more mundane and diluted versions of ''Heirs of Osiris''.

As of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], these mysterious weapons could be found in several places along the [[Sword Coast]]. In the city of [[Neverwinter]], one copy of the ''Heirs of Osiris'' could be purchased from the Temple of Tyr – the [[Hall of Justice]].
