Heirs of Osiris were enchanted light flails that were said to have divine origin.
Heirs of Osiris possessed a simple +1 enchantment. However, when wielded against undead creatures, the flail effectively became a powerful +4 enchanted weapon.
These magic flails were first seen in the Old Empires. However, their history was mostly unknown to inhabitants of Faerûn. Sages believed that the very first Heirs of Osiris was wielded by the avatar of Osiris himself during the Orcgate Wars. As the deity was slain, the original Heirs of Osiris shattered into countless pieces. When Osiris was returned to life, each shard of the original divine weapon regenerated into more mundane and diluted versions of Heirs of Osiris.
As of the late-14 century DR, these mysterious weapons could be found in several places along the Sword Coast. In the city of Neverwinter, one copy of the Heirs of Osiris could be purchased from the Temple of Tyr – the Hall of Justice.
