        "mainbody": "A mancatcher or catch-pole was a type of weapon used for capturing animals, monsters, or people.\nIt was a specialized polearm some  long and weighing  with two curving prongs mounted on one end. These were sized to enclose a humanoid such as a human down to the size of a halfling creatures more than 50% bigger or smaller than the weapon was designed for could not be caught. In addition, these prongs had spikes and sharp inner edges to harm a trapped creature, prevent them using their arms, or limit their attempts to resist or escape.\nSome mancatchers had spring-loaded prongs that snapped shut\nOn striking an opponent, the wielder of a mancatcher could easily try to grab them between the prongs and keep them safely at a distance. Being caught in a mancatcher left a victim near-defenseless and easily pushed or pulled around or forced to kneel or lie prone. One would have to bend the bars to escape, but this was hazardous with the spikes and sharp edges. To rescue a trapped creature, allies typically had to chop through the haft or defeat the wielder first. The standard tactic for the mancatcher was to first trap an opponent and then pull them off their feet or off their mount, and then pin them to ground, where they were almost helpless. The wielder could release the trapped opponent with a little effort.\nThe mancatcher reportedly originated in the continent Kara-Tur, in the nation of Shou Lung.\nNaturalist Mancatcher The Guild of Naturalists used catchpoles of a rather complex design. They had four metal mechanical arms at one end, spring-loaded and triggered by a button at the other end of the pole. The shaft was wood and the pole some  long, but it was capped at the end with a metal sleeve for a second pole to be inserted, turned, and locked into place, doubling the length to .\nMancatchers were favored by city guards and others who needed to capture their foes alive and more-or-less unharmed.\n* The Guild of Naturalists of Myth Drannor used their catch-poles to capture and study monsters. These were cumbersome and difficult to use as weapons without extensive experience and training. They remained in good condition in the Halls of the Beast-Tamers.\n* Kuo-toa used a similar, specialized weapon known as a pincer staff, sometimes called a mancatcher.\n* The samurai of the Home Guard of Aru in Wa could carry mancatchers on certain assignments around 1357 DR.\n* The Watch Guard of Phlan on the Moonsea used noose-and-pole mancatchers. In 1340 DR, they used them when apprehending Shal Bal, Tarl Desanea, and Ren o the Blade after the barroom brawl. Tarl briefly considered resisting, believing that even mancatchers have their weaknesses."
