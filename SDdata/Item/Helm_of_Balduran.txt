The '''''helm of Balduran''''' was a [[magic]]al [[helmet]] that once belonged to the famous explorer [[Balduran]], before he founded the settlement of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was highly sought after by historians, collectors, and adventurers alike.

{{Quote|Baldur's Gate itself bears his name, and tales of his exploits have turned the heads and hearts of many.|''Anonymous.''}}

==Description==
Despite its centuries-long history, the ''helm of Balduran'' still gleamed as bright the day it was crafted.

==Powers==
The helm offered significant protections that were magical in nature, but the origin of which was largely unknown. It granted the wearer both the vitality and favor of the famous adventurer.

==History==
At some point prior to the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Balduran's helm and [[Cloak of Balduran|cloak]] came into the possession of the [[elven]] warrior [[Vail]] and his fellow adventurers. Unfortunately, when the group attempted to raid the [[Ramazith's tower|tower]] of the [[wizard]] [[Ramazith Flamesinger]],<ref group="note">Ramazith Flamesinger was a [[fighter]] according to ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' and ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]]''. they were ''[[petrified]]''. However, prior to their raid, Vail hid the helm behind a trapped painting that hung within the second story of the [[Helm and Cloak]] inn.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''helm of Balduran'' resided in [[Wyrmway]], beneath [[Wyrm's Rock]], safely hidden behind the lifeless body of [[Ansur]], Balduran's once close friend.
