        "Powers": "Wearers did not require food or drink, and required much less in the way of actual sleep. For the ring to work properly, it attuned itself to its user.  This process involved wearing the ring for a full week (7 days), while performing normal actions.  Removing the ring at any time started the process over.  After the week passed, the ring functioned normally.\n\nThe wearer could elect to sleep only 2 hours, and gain the benefit of a full 8 hour rest.  [[Wizard]] spells were not memorized faster with this benefit, however, and still required the normal study time.",
