The '''''tendril rings of Ilsensine''''' were exceedingly rare [[psionic]] [[bracers]]. They could only be made in [[mind flayer]] colonies that either had the [[avatar]] of the [[deity]] [[Ilsensine]] manifest, or in hives that its [[proxy]] [[Lugribossk]] had visited.{{Cite dragon/255/The New Illithid Arsenal|30}}

==Description==
The ''tendril rings'' were thin slips of silver that were large enough to be slipped over a [[ulitharid]]'s mouth tentacles. They always came in pairs as many of their powers would not work with one alone.{{Cite dragon/255/The New Illithid Arsenal|30}}

==Powers==
The ''tendril rings'' made it harder to harm their user with means other than physical combat.

When a wearer was heavily injured, the rings had a built-in defense mechanism that automatically [[teleport]]ed the wearer to a predetermined location on the same [[plane]] whether they wished it or not. In doing so, the rings would consume half of the remaining psionic energy possessed by the ulitharid. This behaved similarly to the spell ''[[teleport without error]]''. The only way to stop this from happening was to remove at least one of the rings.

The ''tendril rings'' were instilled with Ilsensine's power, and once a week a ulitharid was able to utilize another power by rubbing them together. This action caused an eerie sound that resonated both mentally and physically. Soon after, the ''tendril rings'' would connect to Ilsensine and an infinitesimally small portion of the deity's power would leak through into the surrounding area. Illithids and victims within 240 yards (219 meters) became subject to the alien thoughts of Ilsensine itself. Non-illithids could be stunned for up to two minutes, while [[psionicist]]s were more resistant to the effects. Victims that managed to not get stunned found it difficult to do anything for a short time. Mages and priests lost up to four random memorized spells and would have to memorize or pray for them again. Victims were unable to concentrate for half a day, during which psionicists could not replenish their psionic energy and spellcasters could not regain their spells. In contrast to this horror, illithids found Ilsensine's thoughts extremely soothing.

==Notable Users==
* [[Tharcereli]], the Creedmaster of the [[Loretaker Creed]] in [[Oryndoll]].
* [[Cephalossk]], the Creedmaster of the [[Venerator Creed]] in Oryndoll.

These ''tendril rings'' were also owned by the ulitharid Creedmasters of the [[Elder Concord]] of Oryndoll.
