The Naught Katana was a powerful and disturbing artifact katana from Kara-Tur.
The Naught Katana was fashioned from a piece of material of unknown substance and cut from another plane. Its forging drained its creators very soul.
It found its way to the imperial court of Shou Lung, where it was held as a sacred sword. However, a very clever thief took advantage of a very sleepy guard to steal it. The Naught Katana was then transported along the Golden Way and came to Faer√ªn by 1374 DR.
It was a +6 katana that inflicted an incredible amount of negative energy on impact, and dealt terrible injuries to all lawful beings. Strangely, it felt as though it was gradually growing more powerful, and to have a yawning hunger that it imparted to the wielder.
