Tigers claws (also seen as tiger claws) were the favored weapon of the Red Tiger tribe of the Uthgardt barbarians in northwest Faerûn.
This three-bladed dagger had very sharp, thin stone blades—either all of one piece or separate blades mounted on a short wooden handle—that were held projecting between the fingers to look like animal claws. One of these weapons weighed 2 lb (0.9 kg). Because these weapons were special to the tribe, it was very unlikely they would give or sell one, but if one found its way to a market, the typical price was 1 gp.
Some clerics of the Red Tiger tribe could craft magical tigers claws for their warriors and did so before major conflicts, especially battles with orcs, their most hated enemy.
