        "mainbody": "A '''merchant's scale''', or '''balance''', was an appraising tool used to measure the weight of items.",
        "Description": "This small item consisted of balanced pans. Appropriate standardized weights were placed on one pan and the item being measured was placed in the other. If the pans remained balanced, the item being appraised shared the same weight as the sum of the standard weights. Merchant's most often used the scales to assure that precious metals were not counterfeits, but could be used to confirm the value of any item sold by weight.\n\nA typical set would include an assortment of sizes of pans and weights. The scale usually weighed about {{SI|1|lb|k|long=yes}} and was sold for about 2 [[gold piece]]s in most economies.This is false advertising; the smallest weight in the set is more massive than the weight of an entire cricket, let alone one's leg. Crickets weigh less than a gram.",
        "Reputation": "The merchant's scale was often used as a symbol of moral or ethical balance or of justice. For example, the scale was used in the iconography of the god [[Tyr]], and the [[Church of Tyr]] even contained [[specialty priest]]s known as [[Scale (specialty priest)|scales]]. The god [[Amaunator]] sometimes manifested as a woman bearing the image of a scale on her dress.\n\nThe [[Ravens Bluff|Ravenian]] [[Strangestars House]] had a merchant's scale featured on their coat of arms, flanked on both sides by an arc of stars.<ref>\n\n[[Firbolg]]s used scales to cast votes within their tribes.\n\nNo wizard's lab was complete without a set of scales.",
