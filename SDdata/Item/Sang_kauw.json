        "mainbody": "The '''sang kauw''' ({{Pronounce|song|cow|refs=}}) was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "The sang kauw was available in two distinct forms. The primary form consisted of a double-headed spear {{SIrange|3|5|ft|long=yes}} in length with a loop handle positioned at the center, featuring a dagger or crescent extending from it. This version required one hand for effective parrying and attacking. The alternate form closely resembled the first, except for the inclusion of a small buckler fitted in the center, from which the dagger blade projected. Regardless of the chosen form, mastering the use of the sang kauw demanded extensive training for optimal effectiveness."
