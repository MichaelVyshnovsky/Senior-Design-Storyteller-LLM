        "mainbody": "The sang kauw () was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur.\nThe sang kauw was available in two distinct forms. The primary form consisted of a double-headed spear  in length with a loop handle positioned at the center, featuring a dagger or crescent extending from it. This version required one hand for effective parrying and attacking. The alternate form closely resembled the first, except for the inclusion of a small buckler fitted in the center, from which the dagger blade projected. Regardless of the chosen form, mastering the use of the sang kauw demanded extensive training for optimal effectiveness."
