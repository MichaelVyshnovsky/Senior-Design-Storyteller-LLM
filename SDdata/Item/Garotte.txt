Garottes were vile weapons that were used to strangle an unsuspecting victim.
Made from a metal wire strung between two wooden handles, a garotte was a brutally efficient weapon when attacking someone from behind. The target could be strangled within moments or, if enough pressure was applied, their throat could be cut down to the bone.
Garottes were favored by assassins or particularly vile thieves.
A typical garotte cost 3 silver pieces.
