        "mainbody": "'''''Ogi-Luc's great robe''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[wizard]]'s [[robe]] that once belonged to a [[Sembian]] [[archmage]] [[Ogi-Luc]].",
        "Description": "This ''great robe'' was sewn out of heavy and tough Sembian cloth and dyed dark blue, its original master's favorite color.",
        "Powers": "''Ogi-Luc's great robe'' was created to accentuate and improve Ogi-Luc's already impressive physique. The robe's magic drastically increased the wearer's physical strength and gave them reliable defenses in battle. Additionally, this item enhanced the wearer's constitution.",
        "History": "Sembian archmage Ogi-Luc was these curious bones' creator and he wore them into a spell-slinging battle against his enemy, a [[Red Wizard]] [[abjurer]] named [[Nesk Vialtim]]. Ogi-Luc did not survive that faithful encounter and the ''great robe'' was claimed as a prize. Subsequently, these enchanted robes were stolen from the Red Wizard by an unnamed but very ambitious [[thief]].\n\nSome time later, by [[1281 DR]], the ''Ogi-Luc's Great Robe'' ended up in the possession of [[Orrick|Orrick the Gray]], who researched magical ''[[mythal]]s'' in his tower just on the edge of [[Kuldahar]] on the [[Spine of the World]]."
