        "mainbody": "Ogi-Lucs great robe was a unique enchanted wizards robe that once belonged to a Sembian archmage Ogi-Luc.\nThis great robe was sewn out of heavy and tough Sembian cloth and dyed dark blue, its original masters favorite color.\nOgi-Lucs great robe was created to accentuate and improve Ogi-Lucs already impressive physique. The robes magic drastically increased the wearers physical strength and gave them reliable defenses in battle. Additionally, this item enhanced the wearers constitution.\nSembian archmage Ogi-Luc was these curious bones creator and he wore them into a spell-slinging battle against his enemy, a Red Wizard abjurer named Nesk Vialtim. Ogi-Luc did not survive that faithful encounter and the great robe was claimed as a prize. Subsequently, these enchanted robes were stolen from the Red Wizard by an unnamed but very ambitious thief.\nSome time later, by 1281 DR, the Ogi-Lucs Great Robe ended up in the possession of Orrick the Gray, who researched magical mythals in his tower just on the edge of Kuldahar on the Spine of the World."
