        "mainbody": "'''Ruby''' was a variety of [[wikipedia:en:corundum|corundum]] that was a popular and plentiful [[jewels|jewel]] and had many magical uses in addition to its appeal as a sparkling gemstone. It was cherished by worshipers of many gods, including [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Gorm Gulthyn]], [[Haela Brightaxe]], and [[Labelas Enoreth]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}",
        "Description": "Rubies came in a variety of colors, from colorless through shades of red to deep crimson. The darker the shade and the fewer the inclusions and impurities, the more valuable was the gem. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp. About one in every hundred rubies was a [[star ruby]].\n\nRubies were believed to represent love and revenge.\n\nAncient [[gem magic]] associated rubies with the healing powers of [[Earth (element)|earth]], which was the source of [[ruby golem]]s' ability to ''[[regenerate]]'' and their affinity for travelling underground.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Raw Ruby.png|thumb|''A raw ruby.'']]\nSuperstitions around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] but magical uses were much more reliable. Crushed to a powder and used in the enchantment, rubies greatly enhanced personal magic items that increased skill, ability, resistance, or luck.According to [[Elminster]], this was around 5 o'clock in the evening.\n\n[[File:Blood Ruby.png|thumb|''A blood ruby.'']]\nFacet cut and polished rubies were required in the crafting of a ''[[helm of brilliance]]'' and were the gem of choice in decorating items that produced healing magic. With the proper incantations, rubies could ward against natural and magical lightning and earthquakes. Extremely rarely, a ruby might contain a creature that could be released from the stone by delicately shattering it. Such creatures were usually unknown in [[Faer√ªn]] and grew rapidly upon release.\n\nA crushed ruby worth at least 1,000 [[gp]] was required to cast the extremely powerful [[Necromancy|necromatic]] spell ''[[soul shift]]''.\n\n[[File:Storm Ruby.png|thumb|''A storm  ruby.'']]\nRubies were one of the preferred gems for the psionic circuitry in the inventions of the [[Creative Creed]].{{Cite dragon/255/The New Illithid Arsenal|30}}\n\nSupposedly, powdered ruby was an ingredient in the vision-granting [[deep gnome|deep gnomish]] [[wine]] [[Gogondy]].",

        "Notable Rubies": "* ''[[Kossuth ruby]]'' was a magical gem that held a spark of elemental fire.\n* The ''[[Wyvern Crown of Cormyr]]'' was studded with jewels, including rubies.",
        "Notable Users of Rubies": "* Members of the [[knight]]ly order, the [[Keepers of the Mystic Flame]], were awarded for defeating beings that posed a magical threat to all of the ''Realms''.{{Cite polyhedron/130/Keepers of the Mystic Flame|16}}\n* [[Sune]], the goddess of love was known to wear rubies in her hair."
