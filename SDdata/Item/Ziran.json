        "mainbody": "iran or bloodfast was a magical drug made from a number of subterranean fungi. The drow were the first to produce it.\nIt was eaten as either a white powder or tablet.\nUpon ingestion, ziran left one dazed for several seconds. After about a minute, ziran heightened the base agility and reflexes of its user for one to three hours.\nAfter the aforementioned boost ended, the user experienced a feeling of detachment or an out-of-body experience, as though they were looking at themselves from a distance. Their body, meanwhile, suffers real physical damage, though not of an irrecoverable nature.\nOverdosing on Ziran was easy. When a person took two doses during the same day, they took a greater benefit but also suffered greater physical damage. While one could recover from the physical strain with sufficient rest, overdosing too often could lead to death.\nZiran was highly addictive.\nThe drug was known to the drow and was distributed among the military, for example among those of House Jaelre. Valas Jaelre, second cousin to Jezz the Lame, was a known producer of ziran alongside Kammarth. \nKnowledge about its production method spread to the surface at some point prior to the 14th century DR. Alchemists there started to cultivate the required fungi."
