        "mainbody": "'''Ziran''' or '''bloodfast''' was a magical drug made from a number of subterranean fungi. The [[drow]] were the first to produce it.",
        "Description": "It was eaten as either a white powder or tablet.",
        "Uses": "Upon ingestion, ziran left one dazed for several seconds. After about a minute, ziran heightened the base agility and reflexes of its user for one to three hours.\n\nAfter the aforementioned boost ended, the user experienced a feeling of detachment or an out-of-body experience, as though they were looking at themselves from a distance. Their body, meanwhile, suffers real physical damage, though not of an irrecoverable nature.\n\nOverdosing on Ziran was easy. When a person took two doses during the same day, they took a greater benefit but also suffered greater physical damage. While one could recover from the physical strain with sufficient rest, overdosing too often could lead to death.\n\nZiran was highly addictive.",
        "Users": "The drug was known to the [[drow]] and was distributed among the military, for example among those of [[House Jaelre]]. [[Valas Jaelre]], second cousin to [[Jezz the Lame]], was a known producer of ziran alongside [[Kammarth]]. \n\nKnowledge about its production method spread to the surface at some point prior to the 14th century [[DR]]. Alchemists there started to cultivate the required fungi."
