        "mainbody": "javelin of lightning was a magical weapon that could be thrown.\nWhen the wielder threw it and spoke a command word, the weapon transformed into a bolt of lightning. It could be thrown up to 120 feet (37 meters). Each creature in the path of the target was affected, unless they managed to dodge the bolt. The lightning bolt turned back into a javelin when striking the target, and delivered a high amount of lightning damage.\nSeveral adventurers wielded such an item. The more well-known of them included\n* Thunderstorm, a powerful human nomad.\n* Vhazror, an orc barbarian.\n* Raulothim, an ancient emerald dragon who lived on the isle of Axard."
