'''Claevur''' was a food item available in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}

==Description==
Claevur was a fish casserole made from whatever [[salted fish]] was available off of caravans that stopped in Khôltar, the Iron City. The [[fish]] was de-boned and [[spice]]d, then mixed with grubs, greens, and tubers and baked. It was served in a hardrusk bun (a flat-bottomed bread bowl with a large cavity, baked until the crust was very hard) for 2 [[silver piece]]s at [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] on the [[North Way]] near Handrornlar, the northern gate out of Khôltar. This dish was Munsrum's version of what many locals fixed at home.
