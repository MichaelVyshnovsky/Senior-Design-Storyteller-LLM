A '''''sphere of annihilation''''' was a [[magic item]] that consumed everything it touched, but could be somewhat controlled mentally.

==Description==
The object was actually a void in the fabric of the multiverse and was utterly black such that no amount of light could penetrate it or reflect off of it. The ''sphere'' was {{SI|2|ft|c}} in diameter and remained motionless, hovering in position, until acted upon by a mental push from a sentient being.

==Powers==
The surface of the ''sphere'' essentially destroyed whatever it touched. Some described it as being sucked into the void with no chance of resistance or recovery, even by a ''[[wish]]'' or similar magics. and this was evidenced by the immunity that other artifacts seemed to have against being drawn into the void. There were also reports of beings who survived coming in contact with a ''sphere'', but they suffered grievous wounds as if struck by a tremendous force. And finally, [[deity|divine]] intervention was a possible path to restoration from annihilation, but getting the attention of a deity to ask a boon was generally fraught with risk.

The ''sphere'' was partially responsive to mental commands of movement, with beings of higher intelligence having a better chance of success. The black hole always moved when someone attempted to control it, but not always in the desired direction. A failure was typically indicated by the ''sphere'' moving toward the creature that was making the attempt. If two or more people attempted to control the ''sphere'' simultaneously, even cooperatively, the chance for success was reduced for all, or it became a contest between the would-be controllers that was largely determined by intelligence and luck.

There was no evidence that a ''sphere of annihilation'' had intelligence or awareness, but some adventurers reported that one attacked them when they got too close.

The chances of controlling a ''sphere of annihilation'' were greatly improved when in possession of a ''[[talisman of the sphere]]''.

The ''sphere'' also reacted strangely when it came in contact with ''[[portal]]s'', ''[[gate]]'' spells, and other inter-dimensional phenomenon like ''[[portable hole]]s''. There was a random chance that nothing would happen, the ''sphere'' was transported to the destination of the other phenomenon, or every creature and object within {{SI|180|ft}} was whisked off to a random [[plane of existence]]. The most likely outcome was that the ''sphere'' was simply destroyed, but it was a toss up between that and the other possibilities. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' and ''[[mage's disjunction]]'' had no effect on a ''sphere'', but a ''[[rod of cancellation]]'' that came in contact with a ''sphere'' resulted in a blast of mutual destruction that damaged everything within a {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} radius.

It was impossible to bring a ''sphere of annihilation'' into the [[Demiplane of Time]].<ref>

==History==
Around [[1346 DR]], a {{SI|10|ft}} large ''sphere of annihilation'' appeared in [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]]. To be more precise, it appeared in [[House Karanok]]'s, the ruling family, torture chamber at the exact place where they were torturing a wizard, completely annihilating that one. The nobles then started to worship the ''sphere''. Around [[1370 DR]], [[Tiamat]] modified the ''sphere''. It started to create smaller ones and to double as a channeling device for the Chromatic Dragon's powers. This allowed her to grant divine spells to the members of House Karanok. These [[cleric]]s of Tiamat, or Entropy as they called the ''sphere'', also learned to become [[entropist]]s.
