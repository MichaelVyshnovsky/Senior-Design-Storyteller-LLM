        "mainbody": "A grindstone was a simple mechanical device used to polish and sharpen metal items.\nA typical grindstone could be hand-powered, or pedal-powered to ensure easy operation and a steady rate of rotation.\nA smaller table-top version called the grinding wheel was used by jewelers to polish and finish gems and delicate pieces of metalwork.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a 20 gp foot-powered grindstone for sharpening metal blades."
