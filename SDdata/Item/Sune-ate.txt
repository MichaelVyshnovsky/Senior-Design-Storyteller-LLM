'''Sune-ate''' was a type of [[armor]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The sune-ate served as a protective shin guard that safeguarded the lower leg from the ankle to the knee. Constructed from metal splints affixed to leather padding, it was securely wrapped around the shin and fastened into position. This armor effectively shielded against potentially debilitating strikes aimed at the lower leg.
