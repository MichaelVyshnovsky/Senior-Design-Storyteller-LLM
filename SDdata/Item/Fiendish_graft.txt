'''Fiendish grafts''' were body parts of [[fiend]]s that were [[graft|attached]] to the bodies of other corporeal creatures or people.

==Description==
These grafts were inherently malevolent, and having one would twist a person's the personality as well as their appearance. Recipients of such grafts found themselves either tempted toward committing evil acts or being driven mad if such urges conflicted with their goodly nature.

===Creation===
Only fiends possessed the knowledge of how to create and attach such grafts,&mdash;and [[sibriex]]es&mdash;who could conjure grafts from [[Abyssal]] chaos and instantly meld one onto a willing recipient or even force one onto a helpless victim.

There were also said to exist magical devices that a creature could fit inside and which would remove and replace limbs in exceedingly painful&mdash;and potentially fatal&mdash;procedures.

==Notable Fiendish Grafts==
===Arms===
;Clawed arm
:A muscled and sinewy arm with a large, clawed hand.
;Flexible arm
:A long, strong, and tentacle-like arm that ended in a clawed hand with three fingers.
;Grappling tentacle
:A long, strong, and tentacle-like arm that ended in a barbed hook ideal for grabbing onto enemies.
;Long arm
:A thin and wiry arm that was obviously too long for the recipient and thus extended their reach.

===Face===
;Charming eye
:A [[goat]]like, golden eye that allowed the recipient to [[True seeing|see perfectly]] in even magical darkness and to ''[[Charm monster|charm]]'' other creatures.
;Fearsome eye
:A bright red eye with a black iris that allowed the recipient to ''[[see invisibility]]'' and to paralyze other creatures with fear.
;Fiendish ear
:A fan-shaped ear (looking like spikes connected by membranous skin) that granted the recipient keen hearing, except on rare occasions when all they heard was the chaos of [[Pandemonium]].
;Fiendish jaw
:A heavy, tusked jawbone covered in scaled skin and full of sharp, crooked teeth. The recipient of this graft could use the heavy tusks to gore their enemies.

===Legs===
;Fast leg
:A long and agile leg that made the recipient faster.
;Springing leg
:An extremely long leg with a pronounced bend at the knee (which could be bent either forwards or backwards) that allowed the recipient to jump further and higher. The leg was awkward enough that the recipient had difficulty walking.
;Strong leg
:A large and muscular leg that enhanced the recipient's endurance.
;Trampling leg
:A short, thick, [[elephant]]like leg that could be used to stomp on enemies.

===Tails===
;Sting tail
:A large, [[scorpion]]like tail that ended in a [[poison]]ous stinger that could be used to attack foes.
;Whip tail
:A long, [[whip]]like tail that seemed to have a mind of its own and could lash out at the recipient's enemies. Injuries from the tail burned with paralyzing pain.

===Wings===
;Feathered wings
:Large, [[bird]]like wings tipped with claws&mdash;similar to those of an [[erinyes]] or [[vrock]]&mdash;enabled the recipient to fly.
;Membranous wing
:[[Bat]]like wings&mdash;similar to those of a [[pit fiend]] or [[succubus]]&mdash;enabled the recipient to fly.

===Other===
;Fiendish skin
:Grafts of thick skin that provided permanent natural armor.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Rauthan Zarass]], a [[Zhentarim]] [[slave]]r and underling of [[Manshoon]] who had a clawed arm. He was slain by [[Storm Silverhand]].{{Cite web/Storm Silverhand's Quieter Days IV: On the Boil, Part 2}}
* [[Warduke]], an infamous evil [[adventurer]] from [[Oerth]], who possessed a glowing fearsome eye.{{Cite dungeon/105/Critical Threats: Warduke|70-71}}
