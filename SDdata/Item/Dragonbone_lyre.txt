A '''dragonbone lyre''' was used to subdue the [[Whispermere guardian|guardian]] of the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==Description==
This [[lyre]] was small and fine and seemingly carved from the bones of a [[dragon]]. A piece of parchment tied to it gave some musical notes and read "Play this, and the guardian at [[Black Tree Bend]] will subside—Esvele." It was worth 800 [[gold piece]]s.

==Power==
Although not magical, a specific tune played on the dragonbone lyre would cause the guardian—a massive [[zombie]] [[dragon turtle]]—to subside back into the depths of the swamp and let travellers pass.

==History==
In the early 1370s [[DR]], the priestess of [[Shar]] [[Esvele Graycastle]] supplied the dragonbone lyre and its tune to the [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] ferrymaster [[Sithierel]] so he could sail the ''[[Necreme]]'' on the [[Whispermere]] untroubled by the guardian she'd placed there. It may have been found by adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] when they came through in early [[Eleint]] of the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].
