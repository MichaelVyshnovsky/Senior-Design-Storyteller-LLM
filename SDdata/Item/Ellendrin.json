        "mainbody": "'''''Ellendrin''''', also known as the '''''Weeping Blade''''', was a ''+3 [[longsword]]'' that continuously dripped [[holy water]] along the length of its blade when it was drawn.{{Cite dragon/277/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Soargar's Legacy}}",
        "Powers": "In addition to the effects the blade had on creatures vulnerable to holy water, the sword could confer the effects of the [[spell]] ''[[bless]]'', three times per day.",
        "Description": "The ''Weeping Blade'' was forged from [[star metal]] and possessed a hilt of [[mithral]], with a slightly up-curved crossguard. The grip was wrapped in [[silver]] wire and within the pommel was set a single [[diamond]].",
        "History": "While the exact origin of this renowned sword was unknown, the [[church of Tyr]] maintained that the [[Maimed God]] had a hand in its creation. It earned repeated mention in many tales and legends from the people living around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. It first appeared in [[Old Impiltur]] in [[803 DR]], when it was gifted by the [[Tyr]]ran [[paladin]] [[Mellethos]] to [[Nord|King Nord]]. The regent had proven himself worthy of wielding ''Ellendrin'' after a valiant defense of his kingdom from the [[balor]] [[Ndulu]], and his fiendish army, during the [[Battle of the Moaning Gorge]] some seventeen years prior. King Nord kept the blade throughout his reign. Upon the king's death, the sword was bestowed upon his childhood friend, the knight [[Jondar Tallmane]], by the king's successor, [[Halanter II]].\n\nJondar continued the tradition of wielding ''Ellendrin'' with honor, bearing it in his battles against [[orc]]s of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] and pirate raiders of the [[Inner Sea]]. After the paladin retired from adventuring, settling in the [[Abbey of Grimjaws]] on the western shores of the [[Bluefang Water]], he surrendered the blade to his fellow clergymen and declared it should be bestowed upon a different champion of Tyr every year, whose sole duty would then be the devoted protection of the Impilturan monarchy. The changing of the wielder of ''Ellendrin'' continued for decades, until the final days of the Old Impiltur.\n\nWhen the political machinations and intrigue reached their peak in Impiltur, the Tyrran protector of the monarchy, [[Darbett Tallim]] was killed and ''Ellendrin'' was removed from his possession by the [[archmage]] [[Soargar]], who sought to safeguard it from the chaos and conflict that was bound to ensue. While the sword was believed to be hopelessly lost after King [[Imbrar I]] went missing, it was identified a couple hundred years later, in [[1342 DR]]. The infamous [[thief]], [[Gort]] of [[Tsurlagol]], who was contracted to \"procure\" the blade for interested parties within the [[Moonsea]], brought it to the sage [[Othiiyr Velthrann]], who accurately identified it as the long-lost ''Ellendrin''. After refusing to sell the sword to Othiiyr, Gort left the house of the wise man, and he, and the sword, were never seen or heard from since."
