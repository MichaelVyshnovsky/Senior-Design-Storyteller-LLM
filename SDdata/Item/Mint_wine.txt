'''Mint wine''' was a type of [[wine]] found in the [[Realms]].{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1273822504705015809| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 19-06-2020| date = 18-06-2020}}

==Description==
Mint wine was pale and translucent green. It was an ingredient in the [[Dragon's bite (beverage)|Dragon's bite]] mixed drink.

==Availability==
The festhall of the [[Dryad's Dreams]] in [[Mosstone]] offered mint wine to the customers who desired something different.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], [[Ondrin Dracohorn]] kept a belt flask of mint wine mixed with [[cherryfire]] and drank it when speaking with [[Vangerdahast]], who thought it was a strange combination.

During a conversation between [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Mordenkainen]], and [[Dalamar]], it was mentioned that the gold dragon [[Galglentor]] made mint wine.{{Cite dragon/196/Three Wizards Too Many|83}}
