'''''Night Walkers''''' were a type of [[magic]] [[boots]], associated by the followers of the god [[Shar]].

==Description==
These black boots appeared darker than the night's sky, while emitting no detectable dweomers.

==Powers==
Originally, these boots were very strongly [[Item enchantment|enchanted]], and allowed the wearer to move swiftly, without revealing their magical presence. They even allowed the wearer to ''[[shadow door|step through a door of invisibility]]'', several times per day.

Over time, their powers faded somewhat. By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Night Walkers'' made the wearer immune to becoming enwebbed, such as the effects of the [[web]] [[spell]] and natural webs produced by [[spider]]s. It also allowed them to ''[[misty step|teleport themself by stepping through dark mist]]''.

==History==
These boots were originally created in honor of the Mistress of the Night, Shar.

One pair was worn by a [[Dark Justiciars|Dark Justiciar]], a member of the [[church of Shar]] that had gained admittance by killing a member of the [[Church of Sel√ªne]]. Very self-assured, the Dark Justiciar was a among the Sharrans that raided [[Moonhaven]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, but died during the assault.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Alorgoth]], founder of the [[Order of the Dark Moon]].
* [[Nere]], a [[True Soul]] of the [[Absolute]] that dwelled within [[Grymforge]].
