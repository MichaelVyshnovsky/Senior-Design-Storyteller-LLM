Osiris crook was a unique melee weapon wielded by the avatar of Osiris, the Lord of the Dead within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Osiris only wielded his ceremonial crook as a secondary weapon to compliment his enchanted flail. Though it did not cause any physical harm, the crook could be used to snatch enemies up to  away and pull them toward Osiris. Targets drawn to Osiris in this manner had their movement severely restricted, making them easy targets, and also found themselves bound to remain within  of him.
