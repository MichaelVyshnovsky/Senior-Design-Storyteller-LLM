}}'''''Osiris' crook''''' was a unique melee weapon wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Osiris]], the Lord of the Dead within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Powers==
Osiris only wielded his ceremonial crook as a secondary weapon to compliment his [[enchanted]] [[Osiris' flail|flail]]. Though it did not cause any physical harm, the crook could be used to snatch enemies up to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} away and pull them toward Osiris. Targets drawn to Osiris in this manner had their movement severely restricted, making them easy targets, and also found themselves bound to remain within {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} of him.
