'''Fiertallin''' was a cosmetic commonly used in [[Ulgarth]].

It was a white, chalky substance gathered from the river [[Xon]] and exported from the city of [[Suormpar]] to the rest of the realm.

Around [[1367 DR]], women of Ulgarth used fiertallin to add artistic streaks of white to their typically dark hair, as hair was a prime area of fashion.{{Speculation}}
