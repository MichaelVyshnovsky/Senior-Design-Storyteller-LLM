Fiertallin was a cosmetic commonly used in Ulgarth.
It was a white, chalky substance gathered from the river Xon and exported from the city of Suormpar to the rest of the realm.
Around 1367 DR, women of Ulgarth used fiertallin to add artistic streaks of white to their typically dark hair, as hair was a prime area of fashion.
