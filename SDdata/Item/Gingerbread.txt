Gingerbread was a cake-like bread made with ginger from Shou Lung. It was available for purchase in Faer√ªn through Auroras Emporium.
The use of ginger gave a very distinctive flavor to this bread. It was suggested that gingerbread be served topped with whipped cream or rum sauce.
When purchased from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, gingerbread came in a reusable tin, whose lid was adorned with Auroras company logo.
