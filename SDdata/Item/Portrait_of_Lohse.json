        "mainbody": "Portrait of Lohse was a painting depicting a spell-weaving woman, created sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nThe woman in the painting was pictured enveloped by waves of purple magic. Her blue and brown dress and red hair, streaked with white, were wildly flopping with the wild magic. Apparently, this picture captured a bard, mid-dance, and the painter captured something special about the womans eyes, as if there was more than one soul behind them.\nIn the , the Portrait of Lohse was found within the druids library of the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands."
