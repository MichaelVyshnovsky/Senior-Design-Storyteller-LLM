Arrowflight of Angels was an elven enchanted longbow that once belonged to an AkhVelahr war party leader, Victoria, who died in the Weeping War.
Arrowflight of Angels was a delicately crafted elven bow decorated with angel wings.
Victorias bow possessed a powerful +5 enchantment and increased the users constitution. Arrowflight of Angels gave the user ability to cast resurrection.
During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading Army of Darkness and met her demise in the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the drow of House Freth were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victorias gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. Arrowflight of Angels never reached the Underdark as a group of adventurers from Phlan destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs.
