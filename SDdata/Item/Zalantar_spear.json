        "mainbody": "Zalantar spears were enchanted polearms crafted using the wood of the Zalantar trees.\nThe spears made of Zalantar were hard and light weapons, dark brown or almost black in color.\nZalantar wood seems to have magic flow through it, which made enchanting items carved out of it an easy and common task. Zalantar spears possessed an innate +1 enchantment.\nDue to versatility of Zalantar wood, these spears could be found throughout Faer√ªn. As of the late 14 century DR, lightly enchanted Zalantar spears were used in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North, and could be found as far as the jungled of Samarach."
