'''''Dwenthor's cape of bravery''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] created by a [[Cormyr]]ean [[War Wizards|War Wizard]] named [[Dwenthor of the Winds]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
This cape was enchanted to protect the wearer from normal and magical cold and glowed with blue radiance, illuminating {{SI|15'|'"|long=yes}} round it. Additional magics imbued into the cloak significantly enhanced the wearer's skills of persuasion.

==History==
''Dwenthor's cape of bravery'' was enchanted by Dwenthor of the Winds for his young paramour at the time, [[Xanda Pennywell]] of [[Liam's Hold]]. The item was created to protect Xanda from harsh [[Sword Coast]] winters. Another reason for the cape's enchantment and its name was somewhat selfish. Dwenthor was a deserter and a coward. He hoped that Xanda would be able to convince her lover, using the cape's magics, to be brave. However, the romance soon ended after mercenaries hired by War Wizards found Dwenthor and escorted him back to his service to the nation of [[Cormyr]].

Xanda Pennywell held onto the [[magic item]] in case she ever needed [[coin]]. She still possessed the cape in 1372 DR when she was abducted by a [[drow]] [[vampire]] [[Sieronius Dethick]], who was planning on using his magical ''[[charm]]s'' to find a wife and with that break the [[curse]] that kept him imprisoned underneath Liam's Hold. Accounts of the events remained varied; some said that Xanda was rescued by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and she offered ''Dwenthor's cape of bravery'' to the Hero in gratitude.
