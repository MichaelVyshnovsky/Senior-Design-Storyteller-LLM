        "mainbody": "hirsty sand was a magical sand originating in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, that possessed magical properties similar to dust of dryness.\nThirsty sand drained water from nearby living creatures. This sand caused excruciating pain from massive dehydration to a single target. The sand would fall into clumps around the victims feet after draining water from them. Additional handfuls of this sand could be thrown at the same target, causing even more harm. A full gallon of water needed to be consumed to replenish the water stolen by the sand.\nThirsty sand was especially deadly to any water-based creatures."
