Periapts of health were common magical items worn about the neck that prevented the wearer from contracting diseases.
These items were crafted with a gem, which hung on a necklace of silver chain. Hematite was sometimes used in the crafting of this magical jewelry, as that stone was associated with the healing arts. Those made with lapis lazuli sold for around 7,500 gold pieces.
A periapt of health gave off a faint conjuration aura to one able to detect such things.
When worn, the periapt prevented infection or contraction of any disease, including those of supernatural or magical origin.
Anyone trained in the art of crafting wondrous magical items who also knew the spell remove disease could fashion this type of amulet.
Some of the periapts of health came in various power levels. Lesser periapts of health gave the wearer immunity to diseases and poison, normal periapts of health gave the wearer immunity to diseases, poison, the ability, and life force drain, and greater periapts of health gave all the previously listed immunities and regeneration.
Some of the periapts of health could be tracked to Natnea Chesh, one of the first clerics of Kelemvor in the Moonshae Isles. She was rewarded with one of these amulets for defeating a necromancer who was assembling an army of the undead. Along with the periapt of health, she was given the knowledge of how to create these magic items. Over the years she crafted many periapts to aid fellow undead destroyers. Many eventually ended up in the pockets of thieves.
* Alchemists often owned a periapt of health.
