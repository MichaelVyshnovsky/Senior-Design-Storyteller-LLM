Yak butter was a soft cream cheese made from the milk of a yak. It was made in the Spine of the World, Khazari, the Hordelands and the Land of the Yak-Men.
It was a mild and delicate cheese but had a more characterful flavor than a typical cream cheese. The best yak butter was made in the spring after the first major thaw. 
Yak butter was used as an ingredient in butter tea.
As of 1368 DR, a  tub was available for around four silver pieces, whereas a  tub was about 35 gold pieces.
