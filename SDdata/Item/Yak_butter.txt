'''Yak butter''' was a soft cream [[cheese]] made from the [[wikipedia:milk|milk]] of a [[yak]]. It was made in the [[Spine of the World]], [[Khazari]], the [[Hordelands]] and the [[Land of the Yak-Men]].

==Description==
It was a mild and delicate cheese but had a more characterful flavor than a typical [[cream cheese]]. The best yak butter was made in the spring after the first major thaw. 

==Usages==
Yak butter was used as an ingredient in [[butter tea]].

==Prices==
As of [[1368 DR]], a {{SI|1|lbs.|k|long=yes}} tub was available for around four [[silver piece]]s, whereas a {{SI|100|lbs.|k|long=yes}} tub was about 35 [[gold piece]]s.
