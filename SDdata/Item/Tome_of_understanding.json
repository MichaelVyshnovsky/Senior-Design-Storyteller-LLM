        "mainbody": "A tome of understanding was a magical book that contained magically-infused texts that could increase the readers common sense and wisdom.\nTomes of understanding were large, heavy books that contained exercises designed to improve the readers intuition and insight. The topics and themes of these tomes varied. They could contain scholarly treatises and accounts of legal, philosophical, and arcane subjects, or mental exercises that encouraged new modes of thinking.\nCharged within the books words was a powerful magical enchantment. If the reader completed the book within a period of 6 days, an activity that required a total of 48 hours of reading, the reader was endowed with a great improvement to their intuitive and reasoning capacities, potentially transcending their natural potential.\nOnce the tome was fully read, its magical power was spent and it became an ordinary book until it recharged after one century, though they were also known to simply disintegrate after use.\n* A tome was stored inside the Amber Temple in Barovia, one of the Domains of Dread.\n* Chanthalas Ulbright of the Ladys Hall in Baldurs Gate possessed a tome.\n* A tome was stored inside the catacombs of Candlekeep.\n* A tome could be found inside Durlags Tower.\n* The book-obsessed lich Adzerak kept a tome inside his lair of Barrenstone."
