'''''Rings of shocking grasp''''' were enchanted [[ring]]s of various designs that allowed the wearers to electrocute target with mere touch.

==Description==
''Rings of shocking grasp'' were often ordinary in appearance but emitted a weak magical aura.

==Powers==
Even if the aura was weak and hard to detect, the actual enchantment was quite potent. It granted the wearer the ability to deal ''lightning'' damage to a target, similarly to the effects of ''[[shocking grasp]]''. The wearer had to successfully touch the target with the hand that wore this enchanted ring, in order to shock the opponent. Most ''rings of shocking grasp'' held three charges and after exhausting them, went inert for ten minutes.

When the ring was active and worn, it created a round electrified extrusion on the user's palm.

==History==
In [[1281 DR]], a ''rings of shocking grasp'' that belonged to [[Jasper Silverblood]] found it's way into the shop inventory of [[Orrick the Grey]] from [[Kuldahar]]. His ring was a thick band of steel with a [[quartz]] stone impeded in it.

''Rings of shocking grasp'' could be found in the vicinity of [[Freedale]], in [[Shadowdale]] ''circa'' mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].
