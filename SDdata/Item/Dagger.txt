'''Daggers''' were short, two-sided [[blade]]s used for stabbing and thrusting. They were not as long as a [[short sword|''short sword'']], but were larger than a common [[knife|''knife'']].{{Cite dragon/371/The Sorcerer, Levels 1-3}}

==Description==
The material used for daggers varied widely. Beyond metals, some common materials were bone and stone. In addition to these two materials, the people of [[Serôs]] were known to make daggers from [[coral]].<ref>

==Weaponology==
Daggers were easily thrown as improvised ranged weapons. They were excellent for use in an off-hand, for those who preferred dual-wielding melee weapons. And they were also occasionally used as implements by [[sorcerer]]s.

==Notable daggers==
* ''[[Blades of Ochir Naal]]''
* ''[[Spider fang (weapon)|Spider fang]]'', an [[enchanted]] dagger that could both cut and weave webs.

==Notable Owners==
===Individuals===
* ''Daggers'' were often considered [[favored weapon]]s for a wide variety of deities. This included [[Deneir]], [[Gargauth]], [[Savras]], [[Isis]], [[Kiaransalee]], [[Lolth]], [[Abbathor]], [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], and [[Brandobaris]].
===Regions & Settlements===
* Daggers were among the weapons widely used by the people of Serôs. They were often strengthed with enchantments so they could hold additional magic, with a common enchanment being ''[[free action]]''. This particular enchantment allowed them to overcome the issues of water pressure and water resistance.<ref>
