Daggers were short, two-sided blades used for stabbing and thrusting. They were not as long as a short sword, but were larger than a common knife.
The material used for daggers varied widely. Beyond metals, some common materials were bone and stone. In addition to these two materials, the people of Serôs were known to make daggers from coral.
Daggers were easily thrown as improvised ranged weapons. They were excellent for use in an off-hand, for those who preferred dual-wielding melee weapons. And they were also occasionally used as implements by sorcerers.
