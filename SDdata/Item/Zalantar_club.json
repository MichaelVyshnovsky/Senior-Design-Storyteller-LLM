        "mainbody": "Zalantar clubs were simple enchanted bludgeons crafted using the wood of the zalantar tree.\nThe clubs made of zalantar were hard and light weapons, dark brown or almost black in color.\nZalantar wood seemed to have magic flowing through it, which made enchanting items carved out of it an easy and commonly done process. Zalantar clubs possessed an innate +1 enchantment.\nDue to the versatility of zalantar wood, these bludgeons could be found throughout Faer√ªn. As of the late 14 century DR, lightly enchanted zalantar clubs were used in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North, and could be found on the markets of Westgate in the Dragon Coast."
