        "mainbody": "'''''Zalantar clubs''''' were simple [[enchanted]] bludgeons crafted using the wood of the [[zalantar]] [[tree]].",
        "Description": "The clubs made of zalantar were hard and light weapons, dark brown or almost black in color.",
        "Powers": "Zalantar wood seemed to have magic flowing through it, which made enchanting items carved out of it an easy and commonly done process. ''Zalantar clubs'' possessed an innate ''+1'' enchantment.",
        "History": "Due to the versatility of zalantar wood, these bludgeons could be found throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], lightly enchanted ''zalantar clubs'' were used in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]], and could be found on the markets of [[Westgate]] in the [[Dragon Coast]]."
