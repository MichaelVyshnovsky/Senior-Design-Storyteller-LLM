Deaths brink armor was a type of enchanted armor that made the wearer harder to kill.
Either plate or scale armor could be enchanted as deaths brink armor. These armors were black and distinguished by an image of an outthrust hand on the chest.
In addition to providing enhanced protection as expected from magical armor, deaths brink armor could save the life of its wearer as they lay dying, giving them a greater chance of pulling through. In addition, once per day the wearer could call upon the power of the armor to help them survive their mortal wounds.
As of , a Vindicator of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa had enhanced his ironfell plate armor into a potent suit of deaths brink armor. This Vindicator was part of the team responsible for investigating the rejuvenated Castle Perilous.
