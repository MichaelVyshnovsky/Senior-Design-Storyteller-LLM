'''''Death's brink armor''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[armor]] that made the wearer harder to kill.

==Description==
Either [[Plate mail|plate]] or [[scale armor]] could be enchanted as ''death's brink armor''. These armors were black and distinguished by an image of an outthrust hand on the chest.

==Powers==
In addition to providing enhanced protection as expected from magical armor, ''death's brink armor'' could save the life of its wearer as they lay dying, giving them a greater chance of pulling through. In addition, once per day the wearer could call upon the power of the armor to help them survive their mortal wounds.

==Notable Owners==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}},{{4e-time}} a [[Warlock Knights#Ranks|Vindicator]] of the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]] had enhanced his ''[[ironfell]]'' plate armor into a potent suit of ''death's brink armor''. This Vindicator was part of the team responsible for investigating the rejuvenated [[Castle Perilous]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|11-12}}
