        "mainbody": "'''Sapphire''' was a rare variety of [[wikipedia:en:corundum|corundum]] that occurred in the Realms.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Description": "Sapphire was found in shades of pale blue to deep azure. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp.\n\nSapphires were considered sacred by followers of [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Deep Duerra]], [[Eldath]], [[Gaerdal Ironhand]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. Black sapphires specifically were recognized as a sign of approval from [[Bane]], and sacred to followers of [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Laduguer]], [[Lolth]], [[Shargaas]], and [[Vhaeraun]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}}\n\nIn most stones, dazzling blue color of sapphires was achieved via exposing them to extremely high temperatures. This process was called \"cooking\". The color change was permanent, however it did not affect the gem's durability.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Raw Sapphire 2.png|thumb|''A raw sapphire.'']]\nRealmslore held that sapphires increased magical skill and strength and therefore they were used in creating magic blades and items that affected the mind, magical prowess, and the element of air. However, sapphires had a dampening effect on magically induced fear, rage, despair, or insanity and could partially protect the wearer from these effects. When used as a spell component, sapphires ensured the greatest initial effect (usually damage) upon first impact and the longest possible duration. The most auspicious time of day to use sapphires was [[hours of the day|midmorn]].According to [[Elminster]], this is the half hour between 9:45 AM and 10:15 AM.\n\n[[File:Sapphire.png|thumb|''A polished sapphire.'']]\nWith proper preparation, which included bathing the item in a mixture containing powdered sapphire, mounting a large whole sapphire of at least 5,000 gp value on an item such as a sword gave a better than 50 percent chance that the enchantment bonus would be increased.<ref group=\"note\">That is, a +1 sword might become a +2 sword. This could be done at the initial enchantment of the item or as a way of possibly improving an already enchanted item.\n\nSapphires were a required material component for casting some versions of ''[[Drawmij's instant summons]]''.\n\nCrushed sapphires were a part of [[ice golem]] creation. The runes engraved on their bodies were imbued with snow-like [[lichen]] and sapphire dust.",
        "Reputation": "[[File:Sapphire_chult.png|thumb|''An uncut sapphite from [[Chult]].'']]\nSapphires were considered prized gems among the [[drow]]. They especially liked those of darker hues.\n\nTerar-shaped sapphire necklaces were often worn by the noble members of the noble [[Baldurian]] [[patriar families]] during times of mourning. The precious stones represented the weight they felt after suffering great loss.\n\n[[Akabar Bel Akash]], like many other married [[Turmish]]men, wore a sapphire earing, that indicated his marital status.\n\nThe [[gem dragon]] [[sorceress]] [[Nyadnar]] was especially fond of sapphires."
