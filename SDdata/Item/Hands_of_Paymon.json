The [[rogue]] [[Gage]] took them from the [[wizard]] and [[demon]]-binder [[Tenambulum]] on {{yearlink|1374}},{{cite book/Stardeep|20-21|3}}Tenambulum is not explicitly stated to have created the gloves, but given his background as a demon-binder and the fact that the gloves contain a bound demon, later released, seem to strongly point to that Tenambulum created them. Likewise, the alignment of the demon is not openly stated, but as all demons are supposed to embody Chaotic Evil, this article proceeds under that assumption. and wore them until {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|243-245|22}}",
        "Description": "Though nondescript, those gauntlets were warm to the touch, almost hot. The right glove bore a mouth with a too-sinuous tongue, dripping with venom and leading to a bottomless darkness on its palm, while the left glove had an eye on the back of the hand.",
