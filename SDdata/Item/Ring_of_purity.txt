The '''''ring of purity''''' was a [[magic]]al ring from the kingdom of [[Tethyr]], created in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]]. It bolstered the vitality of its wearer and granted them [[divine]] protection, particularly from evil people and creatures. The protective band was inscribed with several holy symbols.

==History==
Around the year [[769 DR]],<ref group="note">The years listed are based on the date of King Strohm's death the hero [[Zachiira]] appeared before [[Strohm III|King Strohm III]], requesting aid to defeat an extremely powerful [[demon]]ic [[vampire]]. The king's advisor, the great and powerful Theurgist [[Karlash Arnostognas]], commissioned the creation of the ''ring of purity'' for the brave adventurer. While Zachiira was able to defeat the [[fiend]], her victorious return home was overshadowed by the death of the mighty king. She placed the [[artifact]] at the base of King Strohm's tomb, where it was eventually stolen by impudent travelers.
