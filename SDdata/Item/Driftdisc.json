        "mainbody": "A driftdisc was a magic item used for movement.\nA driftdisc was a smooth-polished, dark rock disc of 6 feet (1.8 meters) diameter that radiated a faint pearly-white-with-a-greenish-tinge light.\nAs mentioned above, a driftdisc was a rock disc. This rock was a special kind of rock mined from faerzress-rich places. It was so infused with the radiation that it caused some spells cast on it as a part of a secret, long, and exacting process to extend in duration. In the driftdiscs case, the spell was tensers floating disc and the duration was extended to something between two and twelve months. If exposed to sunlight, a driftdisc lost its power like a drowcraft item. By 1372 DR, the driftdisc was improved to withstand sunlight and its effect became permanent. The creation process also changed to the casting of animate objects, detect thoughts, and overland flight. The carrying capacity of a driftdisc was 300 lb. (136 kg).\nDriftdiscs floated at the mental command of the wizard who cast the spell on the rock disc, provided he was within one mile (1.6 km). By 1372 DR, the driftdisc was improved in that regard, they could be verbally commanded by anyone who knew the command word, which was different from driftdisc to driftdisc. Without a command, the discs floated about 3 feet (0.9 meters) above a horizontal surface.\nThe driftdisc could be equipped with a drow house insignia. If done so, they conveyed the ability to use the powers stored into the insignia both for or against the one carried by the driftdisc.\nA driftdisc could be put under the effect of an animate objects spell and made to fight at the command of the user.\nThe driftdisc was a magic item associated with the drow. They were used in important ceremonies and other occasions, They used it to carry stuff, starting from cargo to the purchases of a matrons shopping tour, for movement of people, starting from chariot services to elevator services, for military purpose as firing platforms in temples, or as beds by matrons, the last usage was viewed as a sign of an eccentric trait of the matron. \nYvonnel Baenre used a driftdisc while traveling to Mithral Hall with the army of Menzoberranzan."
