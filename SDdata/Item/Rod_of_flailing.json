        "mainbody": "A rod of flailing was a magic item that could be used as a weapon in combat.\nThese items gave off a hint of alteration magic under scrutiny from a detect magic spell.\nWhen the command word was uttered the rod would transform into an enchanted double-headed flail. The flail would be an appropriate size for the wielders current surroundings. Each of the flails heads could be used to attack a target at the same time, effectively doubling the amount of potential harm from an attack. The heads could be used twice on a single target, or once each for two targets standing side by side.\nRegardless of if the item was in rod or flail form, the wielder could expend a single charge to make it more difficult for opponents to strike them in combat. This magical effect lasted for ten minutes once activated.\n* Mathlas, a high priest of Bane.\n* Rukn ud-Din Mahmud, a caravan guard captain in the Hordelands, carried a rod of flailing."
