A '''crowbar''', '''pry bar''', or '''prying bar''', was a [[:Category:Tools|tool]] used by dungeoneers and criminals to pry objects apart and for general demolition.

==Description==
These tools were essentially [[iron]] bars designed in a way to pry open chests or doors. They could be forged by blacksmiths via the use of molds or potentially found on a ''[[robe of useful items]]''.<ref name=dmg-1e-p227"> Crowbars could also be used as improvised bludgeoning [[weapon]]s. 

Crowbars were a part of standard adventuring gear, and when their leverage was applied, they could break open [[lock (item)|locks]]. and [[dungeoneer's pack]]s.

==Availability==
These implements were smithed and sold in various places across [[Faer√ªn]]. 
* The [[Conyberry Arms]] sold particularly poor equipment, such as locks that could only be opened with crowbars, and naturally, crowbars themselves.
* The [[Iron Bull Smithy]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold crowbars for 6 [[gold piece]]s.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/103/The Living City: The Horse Businesses|16}}

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Auril]]'s followers in [[Mirabar]] begun to act very strangely. They started to attack their temple's walls with prybars and [[pickaxe]]s, potentially searching for a sacred treasure.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Asilther Graelor]], the [[Harper]] [[thief]]
