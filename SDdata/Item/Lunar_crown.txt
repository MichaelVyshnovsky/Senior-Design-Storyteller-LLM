Lunar Crown and an enchanted clerics circlet from Waterdeep, in the late 15 century DR.
Lunar crowns were metallic silvery circlets of bulky size. They offered protection to the wearers forehead and with its two side guards, to the wearers ears. The front of the circlet was decorated with an image of a side-turned crescent.
Lunar crowns enhanced the wearers healing magic, turning a simple healing spell into mass cure wounds.
