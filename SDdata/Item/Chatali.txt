'''Chatali''' was a [[tea]] brewed from the crushed leaves and seeds of a plant that grew only in the jungles of [[Chult]].{{Cite dragon+/16/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalu√© Part Two}}

==History==
The tea was famously a favorite drink of the royalty of [[Mezro]], and as such had been written about in books and was known to sages as far away as the [[Sword Coast]]. 

Decades after the fall of Mezro in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], inhabitants of Chult such as the [[druid]] [[Qawasha]] continued to brew the tea.
