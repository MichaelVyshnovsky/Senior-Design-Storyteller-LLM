Chatali was a tea brewed from the crushed leaves and seeds of a plant that grew only in the jungles of Chult.
The tea was famously a favorite drink of the royalty of Mezro, and as such had been written about in books and was known to sages as far away as the Sword Coast. 
Decades after the fall of Mezro in the late 15 century DR, inhabitants of Chult such as the druid Qawasha continued to brew the tea.
