        "mainbody": "'''Orblen''' was a rare gemstone unique to the Realms and highly prized along the [[Sword Coast North]]. Due to its rich color, it was sometimes called '''honeystone'''. The largest known Orblen was 6&nbsp;in (15&nbsp;cm) across and was held by King [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "Although rare, orblen occurred in massive deposits that yielded large gems that could be cut cabochon or faceted. Its nickname came from the deep, lustrous gold hue that resembled [[honey]]. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000&nbsp;gp.",
        "Powers": "Honeystone had two very different responses to magic cast upon it. If any healing spell was cast into the stone, it produced a golden glow that warmed and illuminated everything in a 60&nbsp;ft (18.3&nbsp;m) radius that lasted for two hours. Beings touched by this radiance were immediately granted the benefits of a ''[[potion of vitality]]'', and anyone that remained within the glow for a full, continuous hour received a healing on the order of an extra-potent ''[[cure light wounds]]''. However, if a spell from the [[Evocation school|invocation/evocation school]] or the [[combat sphere]] of divine magic was cast upon an orblen, it detonated in a short-range, triple ''[[meteor swarm]]''&mdash;a dozen 2&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;cm) balls of flame, equally spaced around the center as points on a compass, out to a distance of 20&nbsp;ft (6.1&nbsp;m)&mdash;with devastating effect. Due to overlapping spheres in the confined space, anyone or anything near the orblen when it exploded was likely to be hit by multiple meteors."
