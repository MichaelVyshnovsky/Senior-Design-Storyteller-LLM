        "mainbody": "The '''''nay of the djinn'''''  was a magical musical instrument created by skilled [[djinn]] craftsmen to honor the chieftain of the [[jann of the High Desert]] on his ascension day.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}\n\nSince each new [[jann]] chieftain received a full set of magical instruments known collectively as the [[instruments of the jann]], there were multiple ''nays of the djinn'' scattered throughout [[Zakhara]].",
        "Description": "In many ways this instrument was just like any other ''[[nay]]''. However, it was constructed of [[gold]] harvested from a special plant called a [[golden wand]] whose reeds were metallic. These plants were only found within the [[World Pillar Mountains|mountainous region]] of the dangerous [[Land of the Yak-Men]]. Many djinn sacrificed their lives in order to obtain this rare material for the ''nay''.",
        "Powers": "Anyone playing the ''nay of the djinn'' replicated the effects of the ''[[enthrall]]'' spell  to anyone who listened so long as they kept playing the instrument. [[Bard]]s or ''[[rawunin]]'' could use this power twice per day, but all others could only activate this magic once per day.\n\nAdditionally, bards and ''rawunin'' could use the ''nay'' to \"whistle up the wind\", summoning a strong [[air elemental]] to do their bidding as long as the music of the ''nay'' was played. The elemental returned to their [[Elemental Plane of Air|home plane]] the moment the music stopped or was interrupted in any way. This power could be used once per week."
