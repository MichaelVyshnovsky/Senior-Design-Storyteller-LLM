The Stream of Anguish was one of the Angurvadal blades, a unique flame tongue that once belonged to the great Frithiof.
The blade of the Stream of Anguish lit with flames whenever it was drawn.
It possessed a powerful +4 enchantment and could temporarily grant its wielder strength that was equivalent to that of a fire giant. 
After the sword was seperated from its previous owner Frithiof, it came into the possession of the githyanki captain of an astral ship.
The Stream of Anguish was considered to be a weapon of legend by the people of the Realms.
A few skilled smiths were aware that the Stream of Anguish held additional powers that could be revealed with the use of liquid mercury. One such individual was the Cespenar, the imp "butler" who served the dead god Bhaal.
