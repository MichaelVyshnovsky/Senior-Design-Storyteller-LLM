Light shields of defiance were enchanted shields that offered limited protection to the wearer, popularized in the 15 century DR.
Light shields of defiance magically improved the wielders defenses as well as protections against mundane and magical effects. Additionally, these shields granted their masters regeneration when they suffered significant harm. These shields could only be used by clerics and fighters.
In the 15 century DR, various shields of defiance could be found among bandits and heroes of the Sword Mountains, areas surrounding and markets of the city of Neverwinter.
