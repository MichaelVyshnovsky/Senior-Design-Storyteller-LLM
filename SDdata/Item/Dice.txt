Dice () was "one of the four universal games" of Faer√ªn along with chess, draughts, and Talis. It was played on multiple planes of existence.
Dice were typically cubes carved from ivory, bone, wood, or even stone. And they were marked with numbers ranging from one to six. Though dice also came in a variety of other geometric shapes that sported more numbers. Typical dice sets came in leather cups, which were often used for rolling them, though others simply shook them in their hands before throwing them on to the floor or table.
Multiple games could be played with dice, such as various gambling games and other bar-entertainment.
Turmish was a known producer of dice, and Auroras Emporium sold dice imported from that country.
