They were shaped in hand-size and encased in dough so that revelers could store extra pies in their pockets.\nCorm Orps annual Harvest Festival flooded the village with dancing, singing, merriment, and food. Freshly baked sugarberry pies were served in big batches straight out of the oven. In the late 14 century DR, Pel Baker was one of the bakers producing the sweet treats, a silver coin per handpie. Hin survivor of a Corm Orp massacre – Tam Acorn, was a lover of sugarberry pies – his favorite part of the Harvest Festival."
