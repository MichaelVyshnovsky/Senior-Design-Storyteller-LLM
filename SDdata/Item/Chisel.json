One particular variation of it was called a graver.\nA chisel resembled a metal rod with a knife-like wedge at one end, able to be driven into material with a hammer-blow.\nChisels could be used in almost every trade that required material to be cut, etched, or chipped away, including metalworking,\nA variation called tatami nomi was used by ninjas to chisel away the wood around locks."
