A caduceus staff was a type of magical staff, so named for being in the shape of the caduceus symbol, that had minor curative effects.
These staves were carved from oakwood.
These staves only functioned in the hands of either a cleric or druid. These staves could cast an effect similar to the spell cure light wounds twice per day, as well as cure serious wounds once per day.
