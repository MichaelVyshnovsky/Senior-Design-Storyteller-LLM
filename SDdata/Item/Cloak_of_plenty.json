        "mainbody": "'''''Cloaks of plenty''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that protected, warmed, and fed their wearers, created sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "A ''cloak of plenty'' was a quality cloak made of black [[wool]] and signed with deep purple [[satin]].",
        "Powers": "When examined with ''[[detect magic]],'' these cloaks radiated a palpable [[alteration]] magic [[aura]]. When worn, a ''cloak of plenty'' offered significant protection against elemental effects and magic while always keeping the wearer warm and dry. Its magical comfort was such that the wearer could sleep on a pile of rocks and still wake up rested and healed. It also granted the wearer the boon of ''[[ultravision]]''.\n\nThe cloak's lining also hid twelve pockets filled with extra-dimensional spaces. Each pocket and each space held one of the following things: half a pound (230 grams) of [[cheese]], half a pound of warm fresh [[cinnamon raisin bread]], one pound of [[spare ribs]], four ears of steamed [[sweet corn]] smothered in [[butter]], one [[apple]], one [[orange]], one [[pear]], half a pint (280 milliliters) of [[honey]], half a pound of cracked [[walnut]]s, one quart of [[strawberries]], one quart of cold [[apple cider]], one quart chilled drinking water, and a single [[hunting knife]]. The pockets' contents were refilled through the cloak's magics daily.",
        "History": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, a ''cloak of plenty'' belonged to Lady [[Holly Graham]] who ran Ravens Bluff's [[Holly's Mill|only cider mill]]."
