        "mainbody": "The celebrants blade was a unique enchanted battleaxe.\nThis battleaxe was known to be exquisitely beautiful and one could tell its fine craftsmanship just by looking at it.\nThis battleaxe possessed a +4 enchantment.\nThe celebrants blade was forged by the dwarven craftsman Briath Silverhand to celebrate the finished construction of a monument to the dwarven god Moradin in the fortress of Dorns Deep. He then hid the battleaxe within the monuments stone furnace, with hopes that it would one day be of use to someone seeking to liberate the dwarven fortress from unforeseeable evils."
