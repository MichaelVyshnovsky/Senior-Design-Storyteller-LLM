        "mainbody": "'''''Shazzellim''''' was an [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] [[scimitar]] created by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] with the express purpose of slaying [[Harper]]s. It has been cared for poorly, evidenced by chips, scratches and the like and it resented that fact. It hated its own existence, resulting in its mean disposition.",
        "Description": "The sword seems to be made out of very poor [[steel]] but the edge was very sharp. It had an iron guard curved into rearing serpents and a dyed red leather grip that either browned with age or had possibly been replaced.\n\nIt had a mean gloomy personality.",
        "History": "''Shazzellim'' was created by, or at least under the orders of, [[Lauzoril]] of the Red Wizards of Thay to slay his most hated enemies, the Harpers. The reason for this hatred was unknown.\n\nThe sword was wielded by [[Ahlzul]], an army captain of Thay who had been ordered to travel to [[Archendale]] and slay one of the [[Seven Sisters]], [[Dove Falconhand]]. Unfortunately for Ahlzul, he mistakenly attacked another female knight, by the name of [[Jasilmer]] and was killed in battle. Ahlzul's men recovered his body, along with the sword, but they were in turn killed by the forces of the dale.\n\nThe sword was lost for some time, but was recovered by the [[Zhentarim]] caravan master [[Lhemako Tarsakh]] and identified by the [[sage]] [[Helavaster]], in the city of [[Hillsfar]]. One the sword's identity was verified, Lhemako presented it to his superior [[Meer]], who in turn disappeared. Eventually ''Shazzellim'' made its way to [[Zhent]] superiors in [[Zhentil Keep]].",
        "Abilities": "The ''+1 [[keen]] scimitar'' had a [[neutral evil]] alignment, spoke [[common]], [[orc language|orcish]], [[abyssal language|abyssal]] and [[infernal language|infernal]]. It gave its wielder the ability to ''[[detect magic]]'' at will and continuously revealed magically-hidden passageways. and, three times per day, ''[[locate object]]''. It had the dedicated power of casting the [[spell]] ''[[fireball]]''.\n\nIt was believed that ''Shazzellim'' could at one time instantly ''[[disintegrate]]'' any [[bard]] it struck, though this wasn't apparent following the [[Time of Troubles]]."
