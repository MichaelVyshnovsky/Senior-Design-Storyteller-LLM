'''Glass tubing''' was a scientific item in the Realms often used by [[wizard]]s during laboratory experiments and research.

==Description==
The glass-blowers guild in [[Urmlaspyr]] produced a variety of glass tubing in length increments of {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} that could be straight or bent as needed. Additionally, a specialized coiled tube could be made that was perfect for distillation.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold glass tubing for 2 [[silver piece]]s per {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}}, but also offered coiled tubes for 5 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Users==
* Glass tubing was favored by wizards.
