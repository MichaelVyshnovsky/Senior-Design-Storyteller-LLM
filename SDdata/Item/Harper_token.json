        "mainbody": "A Harper token was a small brooch, ring, belt buckle, or other such item that was typically made of silver or, less frequently, gold. It was often embossed with the symbol of the Harpers, or more simply the image of a tree or musical note. Regardless of its form, Harper tokens were used to identify members of \"Those who Harp\". When a token came in contact with a Harper pin the wearer of the pin could identify the token as being valid, or a fraudulent copy."
