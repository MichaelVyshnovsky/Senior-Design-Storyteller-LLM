        "mainbody": "A '''''Harper token''''' was a small brooch, ring, belt buckle, or other such item that was typically made of [[silver]] or, less frequently, [[gold]]. It was often embossed with the symbol of the [[Harpers]], or more simply the image of a tree or musical note. Regardless of its form, Harper tokens were used to identify members of \"Those who Harp\". When a token came in contact with a ''[[Harper pin]]'' the wearer of the pin could identify the token as being valid, or a fraudulent copy."
