'''''Dragon slippers''''' were several pairs of [[enchanted]] [[boot]]s created by a noteworthy [[dragon]] hunter [[Feryl Dragonhunter|Feryl]].

==Powers==
These boots were enchanted specifically for slaying dragons. They granted the wearer complete immunity to ''[[fear]]'' and magically affixed themselves to the ground, preventing the wearer from being knocked prone. Additionally, they increased the wearer's dexterity and protected them from spells.

==History==
Feryl Dragonhunter was a man who succeeded in slaying of four dragons in his lifetime. He created several pairs of humorously named ''dragon slippers'', enchanted boots, to aid with the hunt. Ironically enough, Feryl was not killed by a dragon but by a pack of [[goblin]]s on his way to hunt the wyrms. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] several pairs of ''dragon slippers'' could be found across the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]] region.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Olgin Hasterean]], an uncannily intelligent [[ogre mage]] who dwelt within [[Undermountain]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
