        "mainbody": "Stones of Earth were enchanted chokers imbued with protective magics, found in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.\nEach of these amulets was a choker to be wrapped around a wearers neck. It had a carving of a leaf decorating it and a small chunk of an earth mote, living earth, was floating suspended at its center. The mote occasionally radiated green light and could not be hidden by clothes.\nDespite their somewhat exotic appearance, Stones of Earth offered mild protection to the wearer and slightly boosted their ability to deflect incoming attacks.\nThese chokers were gifted to some of the Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge following the battle in defense of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR."
