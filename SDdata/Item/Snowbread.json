        "mainbody": "'''Snowbread''' was a sweet bread available at the [[Hungry Man]] in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]] in [[1368 DR]].",
        "Description": "Snowbread was made from [[molasses]] and [[nut]]s, affording it a rich, sweet flavor.\n\nAccording to [[Elminster]], snowbread got its name from the copious amounts of [[sugar]], [[flour]], and white egg sauce sprinkled over the bread's surface. This gives the bread a hard exterior coating.\n\nSnowbread could either be served plain or with hot sweet sauce drizzled over the top."
