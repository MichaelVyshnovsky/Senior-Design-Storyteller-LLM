        "mainbody": "Snowbread was a sweet bread available at the Hungry Man in Arabel, Cormyr in 1368 DR.\nSnowbread was made from molasses and nuts, affording it a rich, sweet flavor.\nAccording to Elminster, snowbread got its name from the copious amounts of sugar, flour, and white egg sauce sprinkled over the breads surface. This gives the bread a hard exterior coating.\nSnowbread could either be served plain or with hot sweet sauce drizzled over the top."
