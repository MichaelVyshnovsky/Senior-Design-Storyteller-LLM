Amulet of Valindras favor were enchanted amulets and cloak clasps that were created to be boons for Valindra Shadowmantles most loyal servants in the late 15 century DR.
The wearers of the amulets received boosts to their vitality, ability to land lucky devastating strikes, accuracy, and constitution. When an amulet of Valindras favor was worn together with a belt of Valindras guard and a shard of Valindras crown, the amulet greatly fortified the wearers resistance to enthralling and controlling spells and, in turn, strengthened the wearers own such spells.
These amulets were given out to Valindra Shadowmantles lieutenants as a sign of favor. Despite their empowering magics, Valindra could use the amulets to strangle those lieutenants who displeased her. After Valindras defeat by the defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR, some of these amulets were recovered from the villains bodies.
