The '''quiver of plenty''' was a [[magic]]al [[quiver]] capable of producing an unlimited number of magical [[arrow]]s.

==Powers==
The ''quiver of plenty +1'' created unlimited ''+1 arrows'', while the ''quiver of plenty +2'' created unlimited ''+2 arrows''.

==History==
The history of the ''quiver of plenty'' was unknown, apparently forgotten by 1368 DR. However, it was thought to be related to the well documented but unexplainable shortage of skilled [[wikipedia::Fletching|fletchers]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]].

A ''quiver of plenty'' was found in an armoire in [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Amn]] in the {{yearlinkName|1368}}.

==Creation==
Operating from Cespenar's Forge in the [[Abyssal Fortress]], the [[imp]] [[Cespenar]] was able to upgrade a ''quiver of plenty +1'' to a ''quiver of plenty +2'' if given 10,000 [[gp]] and a [[rogue stone]].
