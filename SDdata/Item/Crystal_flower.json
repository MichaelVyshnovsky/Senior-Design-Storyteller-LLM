        "Description": "The flowers were formed from [[gypsum]], [[halite]], or other crystallized minerals that were forced out of a small hole or holes by flowing water. The crystalline formations took on the appearance of a small prismatic or fibrous growth, and were highly prized by Underdark dwellers for their scarcity and beauty. The flowers were used by [[drow]] nobility as table decorations for special events, and [[illithid]]s used them on occasion as a source of salt for seasoning their brain meals."
