        "mainbody": "Wazus Wand was a huge \"wand\" that possessed mysteries magical properties.\nThis \"wand\" was effectively an oversized chunk of yellow crystal, shaped like an icicle with both ends sharp. It was unknown if it was wielded as a wand by some mysterious giant creature or simply the name given to the item by Torleth Mindulspeer. Wazus Wand was as thick as an adult human and as tall as two.\nIn 1372 DR, Wazus Wand could be found in Torleths Treasures, a curio vendor of Gillians Hill. The crystal regularly pulsed and rippled with arcane energies. Torleth had a white tag attached to this unique item, asking for 500 gold pieces for it."
