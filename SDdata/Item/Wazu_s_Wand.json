        "mainbody": "'''''Wazu's Wand''''' was a huge \"[[wand]]\" that possessed mysteries magical properties.",
        "Description": "This \"wand\" was effectively an oversized chunk of yellow crystal, shaped like an icicle with both ends sharp. It was unknown if it was wielded as a wand by some mysterious [[giant]] creature or simply the name given to the item by [[Torleth Mindulspeer]]. ''Wazu's Wand'' was as thick as an adult [[human]] and as tall as two.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], ''Wazu's Wand'' could be found in [[Torleth's Treasures]], a curio vendor of [[Gillian's Hill]]. The crystal regularly pulsed and rippled with arcane energies. Torleth had a white tag attached to this unique item, asking for 500 [[gold]] pieces for it."
