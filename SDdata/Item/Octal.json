        "mainbody": "'''Octal''' was the local specialty alcoholic drink from the [[Maztica]]n city of [[Ulatos]] in [[Payit]], later [[New Amn]].",
        "Description": "The drink was brewed using the pulp from a species of Maztican [[cactus]] called [[Sand Mother]]. Unlike drinks imported from [[Faerûn]], such as [[whiskey]] and [[rum]], octal was much less potent. It was usually kept in [[jug]]s or hollowed out and dried [[gourd]]s.\n\nA single mug of Octal could be priced at up to 20 [[cocoa]] beans – the main currency of the pre-New Amn Maztica. The goddess [[Kiltzi]] was said to look fondly on certain aspects of human affection, such as wild nights of octal-fuelled revelry and love.",
        "Availability": "Payit and its city of [[Ulatos]] and later [[Helmsport]] of New Amn was a major producer of octal. The production of the intoxicating libation was taken over by the colonies and [[Cordell]]'s [[Golden Legion]] following the fall of Payit and Nexal.",
        "History": "Octal was a popular intoxicating substance consumed by the Maztican [[human]]s, as well as [[orc]]s and [[ogre]]s of [[Nexal]] – the slaver creatures spawned by the [[Night of Wailing]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}."
