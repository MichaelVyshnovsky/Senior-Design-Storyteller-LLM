        "Powers": "These decorated ancient shields possessed protective magics and granted [[divine]] spellcasters an additional [[spell]] from the first circle of magic. Additionally, ''shields of devotion'' allowed the wielders to cast the ''[[aid]]'' spell once per day.",
        "History": "Long before the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''shields of devotion'' were said to had belonged to the Paladins of Velen, an order of [[paladin]]s so old, most though them to be nothing but fanciful legends. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Paladins of Velen were believed to be long-extinct and these shields were the only legacy they left behind. Still possessing powerful ''[[bless]]ings'', ''shields of devotion'' inspired many-a hero. One such shield belonged to the [[Harper]] quartermaster [[Talli]], who filled [[druid]] Harper hero [[Jaheira]] into the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]]."
