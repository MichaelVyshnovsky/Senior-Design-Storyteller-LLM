Functionally, the dagger became a +2 enchanted weapon when wielded against goblins.\nGoblin Hunter was created sometime before the , by the enchantress Elytharra Dinnesmore, the wife of Ulbrec Dinnesmore, the speaker of Targos at the time. She created the magic blade as a way to defend herself from goblin raids that menaced the settlements of Icewind Dale. When asked about Goblin Hunter, Elytharra claimed that the weapon was used only a handful of times. As of 1312 DR, the enchantress was willing to part with Goblin Hunter for the rite price."
