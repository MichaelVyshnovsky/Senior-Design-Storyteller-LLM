        "mainbody": "'''''Murlynd's spoon''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[spoon]] capable of creating a nourishing [[gruel]].",
        "Description": "These utensils were usually fashioned from horns.",
        "Powers": "When placed within a smaller empty container, ''Murlynd's spoon'' would create enough gruel to fill the container. The gruel was warm and relatively flavorless, but quite nourishing. The spoon could create enough gruel to feed up to four [[human]]-sized individuals for the entire day.",
        "History": "Specialty priests of [[Waukeen]] called [[goldeye]]s had a chance of receiving a ''Murlynd's spoon'' as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
