The gruel was warm and relatively flavorless, but quite nourishing. The spoon could create enough gruel to feed up to four human-sized individuals for the entire day.\nSpecialty priests of Waukeen called goldeyes had a chance of receiving a Murlynds spoon as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
