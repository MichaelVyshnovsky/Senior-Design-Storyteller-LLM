        "mainbody": "A '''printing press''' was a mechanical device for applying [[ink]] to a surface such as [[paper]].",
        "History": "In [[Shou Lung]], the printing press fell in and out of use, being invented and reinvented at least five times since the time of the [[Li Dynasty]] ({{Yearlink|-1029}} to {{Yearlink|-670}}). Each time, it was used to reprint copies of classic [[Shou]] books, but was forgotten again when demand dropped.\n\nIn the mid–14th century [[DR]], Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] of Shou Lung wished develop Shou literature and popular culture, and thus ordered the redevelopment of the printing press, now with both movable type and [[paper]]. It was used to reprint and distribute new books, even the wildly popular ''[[Romance of the Three Lords]]'' from [[T'u Lung]]. It was predicted printing press technology would never again be lost.\n\nIn [[Faerûn]], meanwhile, the technology remained crude and experimental in the early 1360s [[DR]], producing poor-quality texts. They were only suitable for cheap and low-quality pamphlets, handbills, and flyers, while larger works were too expensive.\n\nThe [[dwarf]] printer [[Forgemaster]] [[Inkstain]] shipped a printing press up from [[Dwarves' Deep (settlement)|Dwarves' Deep]] and began a printing business in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]]. In the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], the [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] visited Inkstain to discuss printing his new book, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]''. However, Inkstain quoted a price of 10,000 [[golden lion (coin)|gold lion]]s just for one copy, and 500 lions for extras, which Koja was unable to pay or raise the money for. Fortunately, the god [[Deneir]], the Lord of All Glyphs and Images, appeared to Koja and granted him [[gem]]s worth at least 10,000 gold pieces to pay for the costs of printing. Koja planned to have his book printed by Inkstain the next day.",
        "Use": "Printing presses were useful for mass-producing texts and could replace the duties of a scribe or scrivener. They were unable to print magical texts, however, as the magic wouldn't stick to the page.\n\nA person who operated a printing press was called a printer."
