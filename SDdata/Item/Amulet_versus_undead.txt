An amulet versus undead was a blessed symbol that granted the wearer the ability to turn undead.
The amulet would glow strongly when displayed in the presence of undead. After being worn for seven days, it allowed the wearer to banish undead as a cleric would, with the strength of the effect depending on the individual amulet.
