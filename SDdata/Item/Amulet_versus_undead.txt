An '''''amulet versus undead''''' was a blessed symbol that granted the wearer the ability to ''[[turn undead]]''.

==Powers==
The amulet would glow strongly when displayed in the presence of [[undead]]. After being worn for seven days, it allowed the wearer to banish undead as a [[cleric]] would, with the strength of the effect depending on the individual ''amulet''.
