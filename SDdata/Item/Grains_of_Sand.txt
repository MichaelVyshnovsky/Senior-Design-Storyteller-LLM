'''''Grains of Sand''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Kara-Tur]]an [[shuriken]]s what once belonged to [[Miri Shokiro]], a [[warrior]], whose life was long forgotten by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Each of the ''Grains of Sand'' was a tiny thrown weapon that dealt minimal damage to its targets; however, each successful hit with a ''Grain of Sand'' had a coin-toss of a chance to afflict the target with ''[[sleep]]''.

==History==
''Grains of Sand'' originated from Miri Shokiro's armory. As a warrior, her deeds and life were long forgotten, leaving behind only records of the philosophy that defined Miri's life. The ''Grains of Sand'' were a perfect illustration of that philosophy that encouraged people to be like sand â€“ be invulnerable to anything but time, be carried by wind and waves, be unable to be taken hold of, and always find nooks and cracks. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''Grains of Sand'' could be found sold on the [[Sword Coast North]] and by [[Okuzo's Imports]] in [[Westgate]].
