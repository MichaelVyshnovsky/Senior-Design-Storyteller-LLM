A glaur was a short curved valved horn, popular among bards in the Realms. It was similar to a cornucopia and sounded like a trumpet.
The glaur was a more versatile instrument than other trumpets. Its sound was brash and metallic. Glaurs made of brass, silver and electrum were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
A variant of the glaur without the valves was called a gloon and had a more mournful sound.
* Following the Spellplague, there was known to exist in the Realms a legendary glaur from Elturgard that was valved and plated in electrum. It had a unique curvature to it that produced a brash, metallic roar that was unlike any other glaur. Legends claimed that it had once been blown by the god Torm.
* Drake Bluenote, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, played the glaur for mock music.
