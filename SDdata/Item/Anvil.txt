'''Anvils''' were an essential tool for metalworking throughout [[Toril]].{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|25}} They were used by all manner of armorers, blacksmiths, jewelers, metal workers, swordsmiths, and weaponsmiths.{{Cite dragon/54/Ruins|12, 71, 73}}

==Description==
[[File:NeverWinter Anvil.png|thumb|left|''An anvil.'']]
[[File:Ingenious Smith.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A smithy [[artificer]] knows how to put an anvil to good use.'']]
Anvils consisted of a large block of metal with a flattened top surface and one pointed end. This flat surface was known as the "face" and was where another object would be either struck or cut. The pointed end was referred to as the "beak" or "horn" and was used to bend bars or sheets of metal. The other end of an anvil was referred to as the "heel" or "tail" and usually had two holes within it for the purposes of other common blacksmith tools, the [[hardie]] and [[punch]].

Anvils typically produced a clanging, clunking, or ringing sound whenever they were struck. A ringing sound was most preferred by [[dwarven]] smiths and those that produced a sweeter tone would fetch higher prices.

==Availability==
Both small- and full-sized anvils made of solid [[steel]] were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Notable Anvils==
* [[Allyn's Anvil]], a pair of ancient megaliths high in the northern [[Alimir Mountains]] that many legends claimed a number of [[artifact]]s were forged upon.
* ''[[Altar of Imix]]'', an [[enchanted]] [[iron]] anvil that was consecrated by the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] in the name of [[Imix]]. It was later discovered by [[Derwin Stonecarver]] of [[Illefarn]], who mistook it for an altar to the dwarven god [[Moradin]].<ref>
* ''[[Anvil of the Blacksmith]]'', a common type of magical anvil that was often used by [[gold dwarves]], [[shield dwarves]], and [[urdunnir]].<ref>
* ''[[Anvil of disjunction]]'', A unique magical anvil in [[Ythryn]]'s Tower of Abjuration that had the power to destroy any non-artifact items imbued with magic.<ref>
* ''[[G'varok's anvil]]'', the anvil once used by disgraced master smith [[G'varok]] of [[Mirabar]].
* [[Moradin's Anvil]], a legendary steel anvil in the [[Great Rift]] that was said to be gifted by Moradin himself.<ref>{{Cite dragon/245/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Dwarven Relics}}
* [[Stronghold anvil]], a type of magical anvil that was distinct to each dwarven stronghold.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|35}}

* The [[Church of Gond]], a religion centered around crafting, had an anvil featured as part of the central altar of nearly all their temples.
* A variety of dwarven [[spell]]s required an anvil as a [[material component]] to cast, including [[Hammer (spell)|''hammer'']], ''[[masterwork]]'', and ''[[tempering]]''.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|28, 32, 34}}
* The spell ''[[semipermanency]]'' required a small anvil as one of its material components.
* In the [[Plane of Shadows|plane]] of [[Arvandor]], the resident [[elves]] were known to be quite skilled in the use of anvils.
* In the plane of [[Muspelheim]], the forges of [[Surtur]] were known to have anvils the size of oxcarts.

==Dwarven Culture==

[[File:Moradin5e.png|thumb|270px|''Moradin, head of the Morndinsamman, toils away at his own divine anvil.'']]
With blacksmithing being a major activity for many dwarves, anvils held a significant place within both their culture and religion. The symbol of [[Moradin]], the head of the [[Morndinsamman]], was typically a [[hammer]] and anvil. Their ancestral legends spoke of him bestowing a hammer and anvil upon the first dwarves.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|24}} Being his symbol, temples to Moradin were typically decorated with anvils. Anvils near the entrances of these temples were always struck by his [[priest]]s before they surrendered any weapons they had to the temples' guards. Moradin was sometimes known to demonstrate his favor with a follower by manifesting his symbol upon an anvil after being struck by a hammer. When he wanted to demonstrate his disfavor though, he was sometimes known to cause anvils to shatter into hundreds of pieces upon being struck.

Worshipers of the dwarven god [[Marthammor Duin]] annually celebrated creativity on the [[Eleasis 9|9th day of Highsun]], a holiday they referred to as simply "the Anvil."

A number of dwarven clans and settlements included anvils in their coat of arms, such as [[Clan Ironstar]], [[Sarphil]], and [[Ironmaster]]. Other clans were known to include the word "anvil" in their name, such as the [[duergar]] clan [[Clan Anvilthew|Anvilthew]], Clan Brawnanvil, and Clan Trueanvil.

==Trivia==
* Inside the [[Craft House of Inspiration]], there was a giant anvil altar that the worshipers of [[Gond]] were known to smash copies of their creations against. This was believed to serve as both an act of tribute to their deity and a request for good fortune.{{Cite dungeon/194/The Crafthouse of Inspiration|4}}
* In the Great Forge of the dwarven city of [[Gauntlgrym]], many wondrous items were forged upon [[adamantine]] anvils that had been blessed by priests of Moradin.
* Back when it was known as Ithmong, the city of [[Darromar]]'s seal was a hammer striking upon an anvil. Coins minted in the city were known to display this seal.<ref>
* The [[Hall of Wonder (Utter East)|Hall of Wonder]] in the [[Utter East]] had a vast image of a hammer and anvil in the center of its floor.
* A number of smithies throughout the Realms included the word "anvil" in their name, such as the [[Old Anvil Smithy]] in [[Sundabar]], the [[Cracked Anvil]] in [[Port Llast]], and the [[Anvil of the Right]] in [[Trademeet]].<ref>
* The land of [[Zakhara]] had two large deserts named for the tool, the [[Genies' Anvil]] and [[Great Anvil]].
