        "Powers": "This weapon was imbued with a powerful ''+5'' enchantment that granted it fearsome power in battle. ''Hammer Veneficus'' also possessed defensive magics that improved the wielder's protections as well as reactions. Lastly, the hammer had eight charges of the ''[[dispel magic]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Hammer Veneficus'' was stashed within the lair of a [[lich]] who dwelt in the passages underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]], along with another unique enchanted item, ''[[Sylmorrir]], Shield of Power'', as well as the lich's [[phylactery]]. The treasures were guarded by eight [[mohrg]]s subservient to their [[undead]] master."
