'''''Obsidian laced robe''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[mage]]'s [[robe]], found in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Obsidian laced robe's'' inner lining was an [[obsidian]]-black faceted cloth that resembled volcanic glass. Despite its hard appearance, the fabric was soft and light against the wearer's skin.

==Powers==
The obsidian fabric of this robe produced heat and felt hot to the touch and granted the wearer resistance to magical and mundane fire. Every time the wearer successfully avoided bing affected by a spell or dodged a deadly incantation, their ''obsidian laced robe'' always lashed out and scorched the enemy spellcaster.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the robe belonged to [[Talli]], a [[Harper]] quartermaster, who followed a fellow Harper hero [[Jaheira]] to the [[Last Light Inn]] in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
