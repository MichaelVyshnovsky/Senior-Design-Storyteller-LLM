Cloaks of Black Flame were enchanted defensive cloaks from the Sorcere of Menzoberranzan.
Cloaks of Black Flame were thick black cloaks that resembled a tangle of black spiderwebs. Once such cloak was put on, its wild cobwebbed texture smoothed into a black masterfully-woven cloth.
These cloaks, originally of drow make, were imbued with magics that protected the wearers from spells and abilities that sapped the strength, energy, and experiences.
The first cloaks of Black Flame originated in the drow Sorcere wizardly academy of Menzoberranzan. They were used by the schools necromancers who often needed protection agains their own undead creations. By the late 14 century DR, similar cloaks were created to be worn by the inhabitants of the surface world.
