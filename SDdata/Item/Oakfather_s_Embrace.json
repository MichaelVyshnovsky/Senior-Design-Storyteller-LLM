        "mainbody": "The Oakfathers Embrace was a suit of enchanted hide armor assocaited with the faith of Silvanus.\nThe armor featured a message embroidered into its surface, related to its \"order of nature\" enchantment. It radiated a subtle amount of divine energy.\nIn addition to the magical protection it provided, Oakfathers Embrace possessed an interesting characteristic. Any undead that struck the wearer were blasted with radiant energy, whereas any beasts that did so, had their attacks imbued with the same force.\nThrough unknown circumstances, the armor was lost within the cave of a female owlbear, not far from the Risen Road in the Western Heartlands."
