A '''''ring of shooting stars''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] capable of many dazzling effects.

==Powers==
These rings only functioned at night or in near total darkness. Their functions varied depending on if they were used outside or underground.

When used outside at night a ''ring of shooting stars'' could perform the following functions: cast ''[[dancing lights]]'' once per hour, cast ''[[light]]'' twice per night with a {{SI|120|ft}} range, cast ''[[ball lightning]]'' once per night. The ring could also release "shooting stars" which functioned like the meteors from a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' [[spell]]. Only three shooting stars could be released per week.

When used indoors or underground a ''ring of shooting stars'' could cast ''[[faerie fire]]'' twice per day and emit a "spark shower" once per day. The spark shower released a cloud of sizzling purple energy that enveloped anything within an area {{SI|20|ft}} long and {{SI|10|ft}} wide, electrifying them with deadly lightning.

==Notable Owners==
[[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali]], the Grandfather of the [[Everlasting]] in [[Zakhara]], carried a ''ring of shooting stars''.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Cardsheets}}
