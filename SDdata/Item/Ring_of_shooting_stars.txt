A ring of shooting stars was an enchanted ring capable of many dazzling effects.
These rings only functioned at night or in near total darkness. Their functions varied depending on if they were used outside or underground.
When used outside at night a ring of shooting stars could perform the following functions cast dancing lights once per hour, cast light twice per night with a  range, cast ball lightning once per night. The ring could also release "shooting stars" which functioned like the meteors from a meteor swarm spell. Only three shooting stars could be released per week.
When used indoors or underground a ring of shooting stars could cast faerie fire twice per day and emit a "spark shower" once per day. The spark shower released a cloud of sizzling purple energy that enveloped anything within an area  long and  wide, electrifying them with deadly lightning.
Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali, the Grandfather of the Everlasting in Zakhara, carried a ring of shooting stars.
