        "mainbody": "The Spellthief was a type of enchanted longbow beneficial for those individuals who were proficient with both ranged weapons and magic.\nWhen a creature touched the Spellthief, they felt a gentle shiver of magical energy flowing from the weapon into the wielders hand, like a promise of recovering expended magics.\nThe enchantments placed on the Spellthief allowed its wielder to recover expended simple magics when landing an especially successful shot. This ability needed time to recharge and could only be activated after the wielder rested for at least one hour.\nIn the , the Spellthief belonged to a green hag from the Western Heartlands who masqueraded as a kindly old herbalist named Auntie Ethel."
