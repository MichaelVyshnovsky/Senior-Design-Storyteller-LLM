        "mainbody": "Talyth was a popular snack and appetizer that usually consisted of a cracker topped with sausage, cheese, and herbs.\nThe most common talyth was made with a cracker roughly the size of a smaller humans palm. The cracker was topped with a thinly sliced sausage, various herbs, and spices. The layers were glued together with a mash of various foods and baked to hold together. Various regional versions of talyth could include a wide variety of delicacies, such as snails, oysters, spiced worms, diced eggs, and cheese mixes.\nTalyth could be sweet, but savory versions were much more common.\nFresh talyths were cooked daily in many places like Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Luskan, Mirabar, Elturel, Everlund, Silverymoon, and Scornubel. In winter months, talyths were pre-made and kept on ice until ready to be re-heated and served.\nThe advent of talyths popularity happened gradually throughout the 1300s DR, starting early in the century from the ports of Cormyr, Westgate, and Sembia, and spreading throughout the Sword Coast as the century went on.\nIn 1490s DR, a Sembian recipe for talyth was fairly popular and commonly found in the homes, taverns, and adventuring camps around Luskan."
