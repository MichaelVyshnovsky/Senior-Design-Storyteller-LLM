A '''''holding door''''' was a type of ''[[dweomered door]]'' that would immobilize any living creature that was vulnerable to mind-affecting [[magic]]. Those persons or creatures that were particularly strong-willed had a chance of breaking free before the end of the duration of the door's effects. 

==Usage==
These doors were often placed as a false exit for those who would be fleeing from danger.

==Creation==
''Holding doors'' were created with use of the ''[[hold monster]]'' spell.
