A holding door was a type of dweomered door that would immobilize any living creature that was vulnerable to mind-affecting magic. Those persons or creatures that were particularly strong-willed had a chance of breaking free before the end of the duration of the doors effects. 
These doors were often placed as a false exit for those who would be fleeing from danger.
Holding doors were created with use of the hold monster spell.
