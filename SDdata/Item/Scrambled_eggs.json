        "mainbody": "'''Scrambled eggs''' was a common morningfeast dish served on [[Toril]] as well as in other worlds.\n\n{{quote|Well, when the [[gnome]]s make scrambled eggs for a large group of people, they beat up all the [[egg]]s with a little [[milk]] and [[salt]] and [[pepper]], and then they cook the eggs. But there's always leftover egg mixture. They pour the leftover egg mixture in a ''[[fusion chamber]]'', and the fusion chamber puts the eggs back into their shells so the gnomes can use them again later. I'm not sure what happens to the milk and salt and pepper. I'm not sure the gnomes know either...|[[Emilo Haversack]]}}",
        "Description": "[[Arrabar]]ran scrambled eggs were cooked in large qantities and served on large platters, missed with [[cheese]] and a special [[lemon]] and [[wine]] sauce. This dish was often accompanied by baked [[Arrabarran stuffed fish]] and hand-ripped fresh [[bead]]s.\n\n[[Tabra]]'s [[Bargewright Inn]] festhall was famous as far as [[Waterdeep]]. Heavily spiced scrambled eggs were on the establishment's menu. The [[Maid of the Moors]] restaurant in the [[Mornbryn's Shield]] of the [[Savage Frontier]] served a dish called the [[fryplate]] that included [[cream]]y scrambled eggs seasoned with pepper and [[brandy]].\n\nPlain scrambled eggs could be found in the city of [[Luskan]] in the [[Sword Coast North]].",
