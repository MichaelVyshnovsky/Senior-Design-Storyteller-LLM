        "mainbody": "A '''''telthukiilir''''' (or '''\"high seeing orb\"''') was an extremely powerful version of a [[crystal ball]].\n\nIt was lit faintly from within, emanating emerald-colored light. By speaking a command, the large orb could show the whereabouts of any individual. It was capable of [[scrying]] even through powerful magical barriers, but its more powerful abilities used its charge more rapidly, and it took time to recover from this.\n\n[[Sarya Dlardrageth]] recovered a ''telthukiilir'' originating from [[Aryvandaar]] from the ruins of [[Nar Kerymhoarth]]."
