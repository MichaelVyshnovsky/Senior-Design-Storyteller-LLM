Force was a magical quality that could be added to any weapon, even ammunition such as arrows.
It allowed the wielder to make destructive blasts of magical force with each attack. The weapon could even shatter through a shield spell or bracers of armor. Incorporeal creatures could also be hurt by force weapons.
Applying the force property required the spell wall of force.
