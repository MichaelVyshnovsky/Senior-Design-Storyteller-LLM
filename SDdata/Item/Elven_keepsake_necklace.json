        "mainbody": "The elven keepsake necklace was the unique enchanted piece of wood elven jewelry that belonged Elveronne Bricket, a nobleman from Daggerford.\nElveronnes keepsake was a lovely necklace with a small delicate locket that held the image of a beautiful young elven woman with green eyes and sun-kissed skin. The item glowed with an eery otherworldly radiance as if imbued with someones spiritual essence.\nThis necklace possessed elven enchantments that enhanced the wearers strength and illuminated  around it with dim blue light.\nDecades before 1372 DR, Elveronne Bricket was deeply in love with a beautiful wood elf lass. They relationship was cut short by the womans father who forbade the romance. Elveronne was gifted the elven keepsake necklace, a bitter sweet reminder of young love lost. The young noble moved to never part with the magic necklace. Throughout his life, Elveronne was haunted of his lovers visage, he never stopped thinking of his jade-eyed beloved.\nIn 1372 DR, at the dusk of his human years, Elveronne Bricket was murdered by his sisters who resented the man for his frugality. During the funeral, Alicine Bricket, one of the sisters, stole the enchanted locket from her brothers body with a sleight of hand. Unbeknownst to the sisters, Elveronnes vow was so strong, it raised him from the grave as a restless dead, burning with hatred for the thief and the murderer - his dear sisters."
