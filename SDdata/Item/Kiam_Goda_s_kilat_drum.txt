'''Kiam Goda's kilat drum''' was a unique [[drum]] that once belonged to [[Kiam Goda]] of [[Alpuk]] in the [[Great Glacier]] sometime in or before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Kiam Goda was an [[Iulutiun]] musician who was famous for his finger-thumb tarradiddles playing his [[sealskin]] [[hand drum]] during the koatulit peace festivals. At some point, the drum left Alpuk and by the {{YearlinkName|1492}} this unique but mundane instrument was sold at the [[Chromatic Scale]] musical instrument shop located on the second floor of [[The Glitter Gala]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. Kiam Goda's kilat drum was among several unique instruments in [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]]'s inventory.
