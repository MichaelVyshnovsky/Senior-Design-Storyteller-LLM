        "mainbody": "Daggerfords Salvation were magic rings that commemorated the defeat of Gorgomorz, Daggerfords Devil by Duke Edwin Daggerford circa 1270 DR.\nDaggerfords Salvation gave the wearer increased defense via improving their parrying and deflection skills and improved their resistance to fire magic and effects as well as fear.\nDaggerfords Salvation, like Edwins elixir, was created in celebration of Duke Edwins triumph over the terrible and murderous Gorgomorz circa 1270 DR. During the Gorgomorz crisis, a big part of Daggerfords militia were crippled by horror at the sigh of the terrible devil. In order for this to never happen again Daggerfords Salvation rings became standard issue for the city guard..\nIn 1372 DR, Daggerfords Salvation were available for purchase from the Moonglow Tower, the temple of Lathander in Daggerford."
