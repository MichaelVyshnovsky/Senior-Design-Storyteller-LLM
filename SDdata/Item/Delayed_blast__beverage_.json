        "mainbody": "elayed blast was a mixed alcoholic beverage that could be found in the Realms during the 14 century DR.\nThe drink was made by a combining sarrak, a juice made from cherries called red renth, and the garden vegetable sweetstalk.\nAn individual may feel nothing for a matter of minutes after drinking delayed blast. When the \"blast\" took place, they would feel burning sensation in the back of their throat, the back of their nose, and around the forehead. This was followed by a dulled sense of hearing and a lessened sensation of pain."
