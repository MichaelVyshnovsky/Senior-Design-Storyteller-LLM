        "mainbody": "'''''Thy-Dunag blade''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]] that originated from somewhere in the distant lands of [[Kara-Tur]], created sometime before [[1312 DR]].",
        "Description": "The blade's hilt was engraved with the phrase \"Thy-Dunag,\" which meant \"more respect than is due\" in one of the [[:Category:Kara-Turan_languages|languages of Kara-Tur]]. The inscription was designed so it was visible even when the blade was sheathed. The sword had a wide base that tapered to a sharp pointâ€”an unusual design for a short sword, and it felt much heavier than other weapons of the type.",
        "Powers": "Apart from possessing a ''+1'' enchantment, ''Thy-Dunag blade'' was a [[silver]]ed sword that had an uncanny way of attracting its opponents' gaze and serving as a distraction in battle.",
        "History": "Long before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Thy-Dunag blade'' was a gift for an unnamed [[warlord]] who opposed a local [[shogun]] of the time. The shogun, whose name was likely lost to time, was scornful of the warlord's ambitions. He invited the warlord into his court and gifted the opponent the ''Thy-Dunag blade''. The sword served as an insult and a warning. By 1312 DR, the sword fell into the hands of [[Malarite]] cultists who allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] to bring down the [[Ten-Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]]. The savage cultists carried the blade to the village of [[Shaengarne Ford]] where the Legion constructed a dam that threatened to flood the coastal towns of [[Icewind Dale]]. After the death of the Malarites at the hands of heroes from [[Targos]], the fate of ''Thy-Dunag blade'' remained unknown."
