        "mainbody": "Thy-Dunag blade was an enchanted shortsword that originated from somewhere in the distant lands of Kara-Tur, created sometime before 1312 DR.\nThe blades hilt was engraved with the phrase \"Thy-Dunag,\" which meant \"more respect than is due\" in one of the languages of Kara-Tur. The inscription was designed so it was visible even when the blade was sheathed. The sword had a wide base that tapered to a sharp pointâ€”an unusual design for a short sword, and it felt much heavier than other weapons of the type.\nApart from possessing a +1 enchantment, Thy-Dunag blade was a silvered sword that had an uncanny way of attracting its opponents gaze and serving as a distraction in battle.\nLong before the , Thy-Dunag blade was a gift for an unnamed warlord who opposed a local shogun of the time. The shogun, whose name was likely lost to time, was scornful of the warlords ambitions. He invited the warlord into his court and gifted the opponent the Thy-Dunag blade. The sword served as an insult and a warning. By 1312 DR, the sword fell into the hands of Malarite cultists who allied with the Legion of the Chimera to bring down the Ten-Towns and Kuldahar. The savage cultists carried the blade to the village of Shaengarne Ford where the Legion constructed a dam that threatened to flood the coastal towns of Icewind Dale. After the death of the Malarites at the hands of heroes from Targos, the fate of Thy-Dunag blade remained unknown."
