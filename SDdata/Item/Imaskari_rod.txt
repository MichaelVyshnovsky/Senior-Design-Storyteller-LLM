An '''''Imaskari rod''''' was a [[enchanted|magical]] [[rod]] of [[Imaskari]] origin that was used to ''[[dispel magic]]'', so as to better fight all things [[divine]] and [[druid]]ic.

==Powers==
These rods were used to cast a powerful ''[[greater dispel magic]]'' [[spell]] three times a day.

==History==
Despite being in common use by the ancient [[Imaskari Empire]], most of the rods were long lost to the ages by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. One of ''Imaskari rods'' could be found in the ruins underneath [[the Bear God's Barrow]], home to the great spirit [[Okku]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. This particular rod was damaged and cracked along its length and somehow radiated the feeling of being alive.
