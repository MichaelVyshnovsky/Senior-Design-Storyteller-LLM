Air spores were artificially created, magical pollen-like spores. Only very few mages knew how to create them.
When ingested by a creature, air spores made their way into the lungs where they then grew, reproduced, and eventually died. In environments devoid of oxygen, they would create oxygen for their host to breathe. But in normal, oxygen rich environments, air spores would hinder a hosts respiration. Every twelve hours of breathing in a normal environment, for each day that the air spores were used, would clear them from a creatures lungs.
* These were among the magical items commonly used by planewalkers and could be purchased in the markets of Sigil at prices lower than those on the Prime Material plane.

* Dissolved air spores were one of the ingredients of the steel dragon Zundaerazylyms magical mixture longbite.
Rumors claimed that these spores were created by some wizard named Mordrom.
