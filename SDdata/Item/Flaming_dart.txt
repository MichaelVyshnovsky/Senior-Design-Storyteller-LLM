'''''Flaming darts''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] thrown projectile fueled by magics of the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Description==
This type of magic [[dart]] could be identified by lines of power intricately bribed onto the shaft of each projectile. Some ''flaming darts'' were enchanted by being soaked in the blood of [[efreeti]] with [[phoenix]] feathers used as their flight.

==Powers==
When a ''dart of fire'' was thrown, it became engulfed un flamed, transforming into a fiery projectile. Additionally, the darts were enhanced with a simple ''+1'' enchantment.
