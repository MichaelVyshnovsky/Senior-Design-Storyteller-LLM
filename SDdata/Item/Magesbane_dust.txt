'''''Magesbane dust''''' was a [[magic|magical]] substance that reacted violently to [[arcane magic]].

==Description==
The dust appeared as a dark, glittering powder similar to ground glass. When applied, it faded to near-invisibility, making it extremely hard to notice by a victim or investigator.

==Powers==
Once applied, the dust caused a violent backlash against any arcane magic cast near it, potentially injuring or killing the spellcaster. 

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], the [[shade]] [[Variance Amatick]] gifted a vial of ''magesbane'' to [[Keph Thingoleir]] in order to gauge his worth. Keph used the dust to sabotage the alchemical workshop of his brother [[Roderio Thingoleir]], hoping to cause an embarrassing accident. He underestimated the power of the dust, and the resulting backlash nearly killed Roderio, drenching him in caustic acid and shredding him with shards of glass. Not knowing the cause of the disaster, his family assumed he had made a critical mistake while brewing potions.
