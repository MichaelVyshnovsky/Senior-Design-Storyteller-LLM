Nettle soup was a type of soup cooked using the Malatran jungle nettle plant from the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur.
Nettle soup was stored in wineskins and was considered a valuable commodity in the Living Jungle. Containers of nettle soup, as well as harvested nettle plants, were available for purchase or barter from the local merchants, including Abu, a hedgehog katanga merchant in the late 14 century DR.
