'''Nettle soup''' was a type of [[category:soup|soup]] cooked using the [[Malatra]]n jungle [[nettle]] plant from the [[Malatran Plateau]] of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Nettle soup was stored in [[wineskin]]s and was considered a valuable commodity in the Living Jungle. Containers of nettle soup, as well as harvested nettle plants, were available for purchase or barter from the local merchants, including [[Abu]], a [[hedgehog katanga]] merchant in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
