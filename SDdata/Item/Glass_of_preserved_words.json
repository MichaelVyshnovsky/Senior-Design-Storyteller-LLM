        "mainbody": "A glass of preserved words was a type of enchanted magnifying glass.\nThese magnifying glasses had ivory handles and a band made of silver around their lens.\nAny writing, normal or magical, viewed through the lens of a glass of preserved words would appear legible. This included things written in worn away stone, inked letters that had blurred due to moisture, messages that were clouded by magic. Outside of their appearance through the lens, words were not altered in any way. Cryptically worded or coded messages were not made understandable.\nThose viewing through the lens were not protected against any curses or magical traps that a writing may have.\n* Some shairs were known to craft these magnifying glasses."
