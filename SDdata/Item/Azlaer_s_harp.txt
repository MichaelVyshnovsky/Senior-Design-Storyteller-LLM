Azlaers harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers.
When played, its strings emitted a soft blue faerie fire. Its music had the ability to alleviate natural or magically induced negative emotions such as despair, fear, hopelessness, and rage, bringing relief within a short time. Moreover, any form of mental control or charm on creatures within hearing range was temporarily blocked, preventing the imposition of new influences, even if a bard attempted to use the harp for this purpose. The harps maximum effective range was  in still air, although this increased up to  downwind or when sound was transmitted through a cavity.
Azlaers harp originated from the ancient city of Myth Drannor.
