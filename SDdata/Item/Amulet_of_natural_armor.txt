Amulets of natural armor were magical pendants that improved the wearers natural defense.
Amulets of natural armor magically toughened the wearers skin, making it harder to break.
Many of the amulets of natural armor that were circulating around the Sword Coast in the late 14 century DR came from Telenn, a retired warrior. When Telenns old age caught up with him, he pivoted his career towards instructing local youth, aspiring adventurers in the art of combat. During that time, he  rekindled his old hobbyâ€”the arcane arts. As he improved his magical skills, he started crafting these amulets for the students, to prevent them injuring each-other. Some time later, when he perfected his amulets of natural armor he decided to return to adventuring aided by his amulets.
An older recipe came from the Imaskarran Tome of Ice, which called for quartz and a skeletons knuckle, enchanted with mage armor.
