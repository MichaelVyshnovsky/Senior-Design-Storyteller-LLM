The seal of readiness was a unique enchanted disk crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Shevarith Kendia in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
The seal was a cold, metal disk that served to remind Shevarith to be like the winds of her native Rashemen ready to strike in any direction.
The seal of readiness empowered Shevariths ability to apply her arcane studies to retaliate swiftly against her attackers.
* Shevarith Kendia, a Rashemi wizard to whom Silverhand also gifted the dagger of lasting memory and Winters Mask.
