The '''''seal of readiness''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] disk crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Shevarith Kendia]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''seal'' was a cold, metal disk that served to remind Shevarith to be like the winds of her native [[Rashemen]]: ready to strike in any direction.

==Powers==
The ''seal of readiness'' empowered Shevarith's ability to apply her [[arcane]] studies to retaliate swiftly against her attackers.

==Notable Owners==
* Shevarith Kendia, a [[Rashemi]] [[wizard]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[dagger of lasting memory]]'' and ''[[Winter's Mask]]''.
