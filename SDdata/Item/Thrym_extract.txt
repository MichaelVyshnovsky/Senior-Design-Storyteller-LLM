Thrym extract was dangerous substance harvested from worms that dwelt in the arctic, such as remorhaz. The extract was most common in the north Faer√ªn, Icewind Dale, and Ten Towns.
Thrym was extracted and distilled from the glands of creatures like remorhaz. This substance allowed the northern worms to stay warm in harsh freezing environments. When extracted, thrym extract was a thick liquid, deadly if consumed.
Thrym extract was a dangerous substance that proved to be fatal if consumed before significant dilution. Alchemists produced safer distilled extracts that were still not safe for consumption.
If ingested, thrym scorched the drinker from the inside, leaving them almost certainly dead. If the creature survived the substance imbibing, they gained immunity to cold temperatures and cold damage.
Circa 1281 DR, diluted thrym extract could be purchased from Kieran Nye, the proprietor of the Whistling Gallows Inn of Lonelywood, Ten Towns. During the same period of time, a blind dwarven smith Tiernon Denthelm who resided in the remorhaz-infested cavers of Gloomfrost, extracted thrym extract for use in his craft and offered it for purchase.
In 1311 DR, a gnome inventor Oswald Fiddlebender used thrym extract along with other exotic items to repair his crashed flying ship in Icewind Dale.
