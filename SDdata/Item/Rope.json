            "Hemp rope": "Rope made from hemp is durable and rugged. The diameter of hemp rope varied, from as small as {{SI|0.25|in|c|long=yes}} to more than {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}}. Hemp rope with large diameters was commonly used aboard ships. Hemp rope was heavy. A {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} length of hemp rope could weight up to {{SI|20|lb|k|long=yes}}. However, a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} length of hemp rope could hold over {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight. It was a preferred type of rope in the [[Nelanther Isles]] due to its strength, greater than that of other materials, and hemp being resistant to rot.",
            "Silk Rope": "Rope made from silk was not as strong as hemp rope but was much lighter. Silk rope was made from long threads of silk, which were braided together into cords, and multiple cord braided together to make the rope. It had a smoother texture than hemp rope. A {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} length of silk rope weighed only {{SI|8|lb|k|long=yes}} but could only hold up to {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight. It was also much more expensive than hemp rope.\n\n[[File:Rappelling down Revel's End.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Caution: slippery surface!'']]"

Alternatively, the [[Master Mariners' Guild]] kept emergency stocks of rope that its members could purchase at bargain rates."
