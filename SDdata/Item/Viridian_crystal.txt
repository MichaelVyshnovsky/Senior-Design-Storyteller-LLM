'''Viridian crystals''', colloquially known as '''fool's emeralds''', was a crystal found in the [[Underdark]] and underground locations in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
Viridian crystals were known for being hard to work with because of their brittleness. Its crystalline form was sharp-edged.

==Powers==
Even though sometimes used for decoration and crafting, fool's emeralds had some alchemical properties. These crystals could be transformed via alchemy into [[salt]]s of viridian crystal that had arcane symbols appear and dissolve in its grains. This substance was mixed with a special vitriol to create a diluted variant of the ''[[oil of sharpness]]''.
