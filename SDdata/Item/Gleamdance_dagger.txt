'''''Gleamdance dagger''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]], created using a pair of [[pixie]] wings with the wings' shimmering tracings visible day and night, shining the brightest in [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]]'s light.

==Powers==
''Gleamdance dagger's'' ''+2'' enchantment guided the wielder's hand towards the target and increased the blade's damage, making it useful when wielding against creatures unaffected by non-magical weapons. The dagger always glowed when it was held in a person's hand, illuminating the area of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} around it. When the dagger was wielded in one's off-hand, it magically increased the wielder's defenses similarly to a ''+1'' armor enchantment.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''Gleamdance dagger'' was wielded by the shady [[gnome]] named [[Farlin]], a thug member of the [[Guild]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], during its conflict with the [[Stone Lord]]'s gang.
