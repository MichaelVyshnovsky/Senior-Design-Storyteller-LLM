'''''Gloves of the rogue''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves created to steady the hands and muscles of an aging [[priestess]], but with time, became primarily used by [[thieves]] and [[rogue]]s.

==Powers==
''Gloves of the rogue'' were enchanted to enhance the finer muscle control and steady hands making them extremely useful for the roguish professions. Steady hands aided in pickpocketing, trap disarming, and other similar tasks.

==History==
Sometime before [[1372 DR]], an aging cleric of [[Oghma]] named [[Milladolin]] found her hands unsteady and weak. The shakes prevented her and her fellow clergy from performing the priestly duties. With the ''[[bless]]ings'' of Oghma, Milladolin created the first set of ''gloves of the rogue''. Their enchantments steadied the shaking arms and improved muscle control. Several years later, one of the young priests of Oghma was caught thieving wearing these gloves. This event spread the word of the ''gloves' of the rogue'' powers and soon, they were stolen.

By 1372 [[DR]], ''gloves of the rogue'' became a fairly common sight in the seedy areas of [[Neverwinter]] and other settlements along the [[Sword Coast]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Feldran Exeltis]], a nobleman from the [[Exeltis]] family of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and the [[Blade Cliffs]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Dela Nereth]], a member of the [[Bloodsailors]] gang of Neverwinter in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
