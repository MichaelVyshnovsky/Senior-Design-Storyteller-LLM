Gloves of the rogue were enchanted gloves created to steady the hands and muscles of an aging priestess, but with time, became primarily used by thieves and rogues.
Gloves of the rogue were enchanted to enhance the finer muscle control and steady hands making them extremely useful for the roguish professions. Steady hands aided in pickpocketing, trap disarming, and other similar tasks.
Sometime before 1372 DR, an aging cleric of Oghma named Milladolin found her hands unsteady and weak. The shakes prevented her and her fellow clergy from performing the priestly duties. With the blessings of Oghma, Milladolin created the first set of gloves of the rogue. Their enchantments steadied the shaking arms and improved muscle control. Several years later, one of the young priests of Oghma was caught thieving wearing these gloves. This event spread the word of the gloves of the rogue powers and soon, they were stolen.
By 1372 DR, gloves of the rogue became a fairly common sight in the seedy areas of Neverwinter and other settlements along the Sword Coast.
