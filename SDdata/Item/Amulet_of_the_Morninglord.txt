'''''Amulets of the Morninglord''''' were [[enchanted]] [[amulet]]s, often reward as boons to individuals who performed special services for the [[Church of Lathander]].

==Description==
There amulets were made out of pure [[gold]].

==Powers==
''Amulets of the Morninglord'' were imbued with various beneficial magical enchantments. One amulet of note glowed with orange radiance at {{SI|15'|'"|long=yes}} and allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[aid]]'' and ''[[bless]]'' spells once per day each.

==History==
One such amulet was gifted to the [[Hero of Daggerford]] in [[1372 DR]] by Dawnbringer [[Liam Sunmist]] for stoping a vile [[necromancer]] [[Daxiong]] who raised victims of an epidemic in [[Gillian's Hill]] to perform dark experiments on them.
