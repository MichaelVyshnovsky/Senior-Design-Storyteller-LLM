'''Bitters''' were a type of a bitter aromatic alcohol that was sometimes consumed by a pint but more often used to add flavor to other drinks.

==Availability==

*In [[Cormyr]], bitters were served with [[ale]] and [[stout]]. [[The Maiden Danced at Dawn]] tavern in [[Dawngleam]] had bitters available for its customers, while in [[Espar]], a famous brewery responsible for the [[Battlestorm Beer]], also produced kegfulls of bitters, locally believed to the the best product of the brothers [[Thorl Battlestorm|Thorl]] and [[Buirylagh Battlestorm]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Dwarves]] of [[Eartheart]] in the [[East Rift]] used bitters with [[honey]] to add flavor to their ale, calling it "sweetness and sorrow in one cup."
*Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], bitters could be found served at the [[Smoldering Corpse Bar]] in the planar City of Doors, [[Sigil]].
