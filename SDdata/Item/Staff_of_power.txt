A staff of power was a powerful magical staff.
A staff of power was usually straight with a precious gem on top.
A staff of power has a number of potent abilities, including casting magic missile, making enemies enfeebled, creating a continual flame, allowing the user to levitate and be protected by a wall of force and globe of invulnerability, holding monsters, and using offensive spells such as lightning bolt, fireball, and cone of cold.
A staff of power could also be willfully broken to release all of its charges within a 30-ft area. Upon being broken, the staff had a 50% likelihood of transporting the wielder to another plane, or else the wielder would be destroyed by spell energy.
A staff of power could also be used as +2 quarterstaff.

A variant had been crafted by the Simbul, known as a belt of power, which operated similarly but in belt form.
According to Hasuraman the Muddled, a staff of power of the variant popular around Neverwinter could be created with the use of the feeblemind spell and a pair of bodak teeth, within the confines of a proper wizards laboratory. Such staves could also be created with quartz and a Giant fire beetles belly, using the fireball spell according a process described in the Imaskarran Tome of Fire.
