A '''''staff of power''''' was a powerful magical [[staff]].

==Description==
A ''staff of power'' was usually straight with a precious gem on top.

==Powers==
A ''staff of power'' has a number of potent abilities, including casting ''[[magic missile]]'', making enemies [[Ray of enfeeblement|enfeebled]], creating a ''[[continual flame]]'', allowing the user to ''[[levitate]]'' and be protected by a ''[[wall of force]]'' and ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'', [[hold monster|holding monsters]], and using offensive spells such as ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', and ''[[cone of cold]]''.

A staff of power could also be willfully broken to release all of its charges within a 30-ft area. Upon being broken, the staff had a 50% likelihood of transporting the wielder to another plane, or else the wielder would be destroyed by spell energy.

A staff of power could also be used as +2 [[quarterstaff]].

===In Neverwinter===
In the year {{yearlink|1372}}, the name was used around [[Neverwinter]] to refer to a lesser staff which could only cast ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', and ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]''. 

===Belt of power===
A variant had been crafted by the [[Simbul]], known as a ''belt of power'', which operated similarly but in belt form.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/The Magister: A Look at the Mortal "Gunslinger" Mage of Mystra}}

==Creation==
According to [[Hasuraman]] the Muddled, a ''staff of power'' of the variant popular around Neverwinter could be created with the use of the [[Feeblemind|''feeblemind'']] spell and a pair of [[bodak]] teeth, within the confines of a proper wizard's laboratory. Such staves could also be created with [[quartz]] and a [[Giant fire beetle]]'s belly, using the ''[[fireball]]'' spell according a process described in the [[Imaskarran Tome of Fire]].
