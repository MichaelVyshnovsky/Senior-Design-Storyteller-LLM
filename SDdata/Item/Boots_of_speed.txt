-century pair of boots of speed.
Boots of speed were a variety of magical boots that allowed the wearer to move across the ground much quicker than usual. They were highly valued by those who regularly traveled long distances across the Realms.
When the wearer clicked the heels of these boots together, their walking speed was doubled and they could more readily avoid the reactionary attacks of their foes. These powers could be used for a length of time totaling 10 minutes before they were required to rest for a matter of hours and recharge the magic within the boots. 
Some varieties of these boots allowed the wearer to cast, or bestowed upon them the effects of,
* Sandals of Speed a variant of the boots of speed that was unique to the continent of Maztica and used sandals in place of boots. They were typically made and used by hishnashapers.
* Snowshoes of Speed an arctic variant of the boots of speed that used snowshoes in place of boots.
