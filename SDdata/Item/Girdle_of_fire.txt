A '''''girdle of fire''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[girdle]] providing protection from fire.

==Description==
A ''girdle of fire'' typically covered the user's midriff, was made of hardened [[leather]], and was fastened with lace at the front; the leather there was sewn in layers that resembled flames, with the points of the flames pointing at the wearer's sternum.

==Powers==
The girdle itself made its wearer immune to nonmagical fire; it was always immune to fire itself. It also granted them immunity to their own fire magic, and considerably eased the avoidance of other fire magic. Even flames that were not completely avoided were powerfully mitigated.

It also allowed the use of ''[[flaming sphere]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', and ''[[fly]]'' once a day each. The last spell left a visible trail of flame, albeit it wouldn't ignite anything.

==History==
[[Talatha Vaerovree]] found such a girdle in a tomb within [[Orsraun Mountains]], in a tomb where the bones of a renegade [[Netherese]] [[sorceress]], [[Nellaura Orbrynsar]], had somehow found themselves.
