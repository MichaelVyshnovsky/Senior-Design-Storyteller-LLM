        "mainbody": "An Elixir of Silvanus was a powerful curative potion that could cure many poisons.\nSuch tonics were kept in dark jars with hempen rope tied around their neck. They were said to be blessed by Silvanus himself, and could cure even the most lethal poisons, the poison from the thorns of Kelemvors Kiss.\nThe Elixir of Silvanus was created by boiling a bundle of mugwort in a pot-full of theriac antidote, as per instructions listed in the botanical book Flora of the Dalelands."
