Crested helmets were an open-faced style of helmet found in the Realms.Though these helmets would more accurately be referred to as "Corinthian helmets" or "Hoplite helmets", such historical names are ill-fitting for the Realms. The name "crested helmet" is taken from the historical campaign sourcebook Age of Heroes, though due to the genericness of such a name it should not be assumed that any mention of a "crested helmet" in the Realms is referring to this style of helmet.
These style of helmets covered most of the wearers head and face, but left the center of the face open.
Sometime after the sundering of the Ordning in 1485 DR, the fire giant warlord Baron Krelas Ugarak assembled an army of fire giants, goblinoids, and human mercenaries to wage a campaign of conquest against Secomber, moving on to Daggerford and eventually Waterdeep. As part of this nefarious plan he was developing a new form of siege engine, known as inferno bombards. The entrance to the Molten Vault where they were being developed was guarded by a large contingent of goblinoids, with the hobgoblins all outfitted in blackened steel armor and crested helmets.As the hobgoblins in this adventure are described as wearing "armor resembling hoplites", it is assumed that the style of helmet described in the adventure is likewise referring to a Corinthian helmet.
