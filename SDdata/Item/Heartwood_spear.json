        "History": "The first ''Heartwood spear'' was a gift from the elves of Evereska to the [[human]] nation of [[Aglarond]] in the [[Unapproachable East]]. The gift was presented following the declaration of peace between them in the {{YearlinkName|1056}}. Since then, ''Heartwood spears'' were created by hand by master weaponsmiths. Some claimed that these weapon smiths were still working on the isle of Evereska as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''Heartwood spears'' could be found in the hands of prominent individuals and master merchants of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Elventree]] on the [[Moonsea]], among other places."
