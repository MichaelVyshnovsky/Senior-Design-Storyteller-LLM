'''Cloaks''' were one of the specialty side dishes served at the ramshackle [[Owlroost Head Inn]] of the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Purskul]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Cloaks were several side dishes served at the Owlroost Head Inn by themselves or as a main entr√©e. To create the first type of cloaks, one needed to cook, chop, and mash [[potato]]s, then shape them and fry until crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, all while flavoring them with [[lemon]], flower buds, and [[rosemary]]. Another option were [[squid]]-stuffed [[yam]]s. The squid was boiled in [[lime]] juice and the plate was then decorated with lemon spices and crushed [[mint]]. Lastly, a portion of [[fried bones salad]] was considered to be one of the inn's cloaks.
