        "Powers": "''Jolora's harp'' concealed a unique power that activated only when the harpist played two clashing chords in succession, creating a discordant key-change not typical in normal music. This caused nearby magical items to temporarily lose their magical abilities. There was a chance this effect could strip magical items of their enchantments permanently. All magical items within a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} radius, including the harp itself and any magical effects on the harpist (except for a [[Harper pin]]) were vulnerable to this effect."
