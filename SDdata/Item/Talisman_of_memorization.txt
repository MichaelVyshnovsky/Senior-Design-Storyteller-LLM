A talisman of memorization was a magic amulet that sped the daily memorization of spells.
These talismans allowed a wizard to prepare spells in half the time that it would normally take. They came in two varieties&mdashthose that only aided in the memorization of weaker spells and those that aided in the memorization of powerful spells. About equal amounts of each type were in existence. The talismans never assisted in the daily memorization of the most powerful of spells.
At least one of the wizards who fought with the Moonlight Men against the orcs of the Nethertide Horde in the Battle of Turnstone Pass had one of these amulets. It was buried with the wizard in the Cairn of Moonlight in Turnstone Pass.
