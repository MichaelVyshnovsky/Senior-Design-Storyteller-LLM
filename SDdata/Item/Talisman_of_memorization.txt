A '''''talisman of memorization''''' was a [[magic item|magic]] [[amulet]] that sped the daily memorization of [[spell]]s.

==Powers==
These [[talisman]]s allowed a [[wizard]] to prepare spells in half the time that it would normally take. They came in two varieties&mdash;those that only aided in the memorization of weaker spells and those that aided in the memorization of powerful spells. About equal amounts of each type were in existence. The ''talismans'' never assisted in the daily memorization of the most powerful of spells.

==Notable Owners==
At least one of the wizards who fought with the [[Moonlight Men]] against the [[orc]]s of the [[Nethertide Horde]] in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] had one of these amulets. It was buried with the wizard in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] in [[Turnstone Pass]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}
