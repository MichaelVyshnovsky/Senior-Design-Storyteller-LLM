Scourge was the magical sword of Gondegal, once the so-called Lost King of Cormyr and later a Knight of the Shadows and leader of the Circle in the Demiplane of Dread.
Scourge was a +1 longsword that rose to +3 when wielded against lycanthropes and shapechangers.
While Gondegal seems to have acquired the weapon in Faer√ªn, some time before or during his uprising in Cormyr in the , its true worth became apparent when the Mists spirited him into the realm of Ravenloft, aiding him in battling the were-creatures, vampires, and other such monsters there. As a Knight of the Shadows, it aided him greatly in combatting evil and dispensing final justice.
