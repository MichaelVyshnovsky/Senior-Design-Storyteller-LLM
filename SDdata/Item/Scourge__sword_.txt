'''''Scourge''''' was the magical sword of [[Gondegal]], once the so-called Lost King of [[Cormyr]] and later a Knight of the Shadows and leader of the Circle in the [[Demiplane of Dread]].

==Powers==
''Scourge'' was a ''+1 [[longsword]]'' that rose to ''+3'' when wielded against [[lycanthrope]]s and [[shapechanger]]s.

==History==
While Gondegal seems to have acquired the weapon in [[Faer√ªn]], some time before or during his uprising in Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, its true worth became apparent when the Mists spirited him into the realm of Ravenloft, aiding him in battling the were-creatures, [[vampire]]s, and other such monsters there. As a Knight of the Shadows, it aided him greatly in combatting evil and dispensing final justice.
