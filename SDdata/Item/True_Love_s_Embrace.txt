True Loves Embrace and True Loves Caress were a pair of enchanted obsidian rings that protected one wearer from harm at the expense of the other.
The wearer of True Loves Embrace could create a warding bond once per day, with its benefits received by the wearer of True Loves Caress. However, the magic could also be activated without the wearers knowledge by the wearer of True Loves Caress.
Sometime before the town of Reithwin was consumed by the shadow-curse in the late 14 century DR, the pair of rings was used as wedding rings by a Sharran cleric named Miranda and her unwitting lover. She performed the wedding ceremony herself and gave her new husband True Loves Embrace the morning before a great battle. As the battle raged, Miranda slew a troop of Harpers whilst suffering not a scratch. Meanwhile, the clerics husband found himself bleeding, sporting mysterious wounds, and lost consciousness. When Miranda returned, she tried to convince the groom not to seek medical aid at Reithwins House of Healing. Despite her insistence, the man traveled to the hospital the following day. After being examined, the Sisters of the House of Healing recognized the Sharran ring and attempted to send the man home untreated. However, soon after, both newlyweds perished in the shadow-curse that consumed the land. By the late 15 century DR, True Loves Embrace was still worn by the skeletal remains of the husband, found in the House of Healing, and True Loves Caress was still on the Sharran priestesss dead body.
