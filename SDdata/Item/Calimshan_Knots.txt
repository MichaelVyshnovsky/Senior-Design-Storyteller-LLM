'''Calimshan Knots''' was a variety of sweet pastry from [[Calimshan]], baked and sold in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the strife of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, brought on by the [[Absolute crisis]], many businesses within Baldur's Gate that were under the protection of the [[Guild]] were faced with increased payment. A certain bakery in the city informed the Guild's bursar, [[Uktar (The Guild)|Uktar]] that it could no longer pay due to the lockdowns and inability to sell goods across the districts of Baldur's Gate. The last payment due was "negotiated" by the Guild's representative, a "[[half-orc]] with the sticky fingers," who agreed to take what was due in the form of Calimshan Knots.
