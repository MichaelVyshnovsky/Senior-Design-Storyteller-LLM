Shields of Darksteel Tower were enchanted tower shields that were once in the hands of a group of surface-dwelling drow sometime before the late 14 century DR.
This darksteel tower shield was enchanted with a potent +2 defensive magic. When used to defend against individuals and creatures that followed and embodied good, these shields became as powerful as a +4 defensive enchantment.
Shields of Darksteel Tower originated in the infamous Darksteel Tower that stood looming over the surface of Faer√ªn some years before the . This tower was briefly lorded over by a vicious coven of surface drow elves. The tower was tirelessly guarded by black cotton-shrouded high priestesses at all hours of the day. The location of the evil drow was eventually discovered by the Harpers and, after a long struggle, the Darksteel Tower was destroyed. The Shields of Darksteel Tower were all that was left from the fallen tower, undamaged by Harper weapons and spells.
By the late 14 century DR, several of the shields of Darksteel Tower could be found on the Sword Coast North in Neverwinter, the Jewel of the North, and as far as the eastern nation of Rashemen and its city of Mulsantir.
