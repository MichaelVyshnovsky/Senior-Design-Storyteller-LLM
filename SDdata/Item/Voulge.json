        "mainbody": "The voulge was a popular polearm variation on the axe and cleaver, variously classified within either the poleaxe family of weapons or the family of polearms that were derived from agricultural tools.\nVoulges consisted of a long, stout shaft, measuring  in length, mounted at the end with a large heavy cleaving blade. Sometimes the top front or back edge of this blade was ground down, giving it a narrowed spiked tip and a hook-shaped fluke at its rear.\nthumb|270px|A voulge stands in the center-right of a group of polearms.\nThe cleaving head of a voulge was used for the purpose of cleaving through armor, aided by the leverage which their poles gave. Those that featured a spiked tip or fluke at their end were better suited for keeping enemies at a distance. And the spiked tip of a voulge was also used for piercing through armor. They required two hands to wield.\nThey were relatively easy to craft and simple to learn how to wield, But they were one of the slowest varieties of polearms.\n* The Weaponers of Cormyr sold voulges among their many types of polearms.\nThe design of the voulge was originally derived from peasants fastening meat cleavers to the end of staves to form makeshift polearms.\n* The Ravenian merchant Bendekar had multiple voulges in his homes expansive weapons collection.\n* Voulges were sometimes utilized by ninjas."
