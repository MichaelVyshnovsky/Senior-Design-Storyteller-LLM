A songhorn was a wind musical instrument, similar to a longhorn.
Songhorns were simple recorders made of wood. Their sound was mellower than that of longhorns and fared better on lower ranges.
They were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
* Drake Bluenote, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, played the songhorn for soft songs.
