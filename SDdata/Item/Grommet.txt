Grommets were a type of small metal item, able to be used as a mechanical component or for making clothes.
* Grommets were made by "dressers", metalworkers who created various small, delicate, and ornamental works.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold grommets in their "Tailors Corner" section for 5 copper pieces a piece.
* Members of the Church of Gond often had access to these.
