The '''''tools of the common man''''' were a trio of legendary [[Chauntea]]-blessed farmers' tools-turned-weapons from the small settlement of [[Cuardin]] on [[Gwynneth]]. Among their number were ''[[Shod's shepherd staff]]'', ''[[Gabe's shovel]]'', and ''[[Boric's pitchfork]]''.

==Description==
The ''tools of the common man'' resembled normal farmers' tools, each imprinted with an image of [[grain]] on their handles.

==Powers==
Already effective weapons in their own right, when used together, the ''tools of the common man'' supernaturally improved the morale of those who fought on their side of any conflict.

The ''tools of the common man'' could typically only be wielded in defense of home and family, or other just causes. They could also only be used by those with [[good]] in their heart or those who advanced the cause of [[neutral]]ity.

==History==
Sometime between the {{YearlinkName|256}}{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}} and the {{YearlinkName|714}}, in an age when [[Myth Drannor]] had not yet fallen and the [[Northlander]]s regularly raided [[Ffolk]] settlements throughout the [[Moonshae Isles]], a small crack force of Northlander troops made their way towards [[Myrloch Vale]] in search of its rumored riches. Although most of Gwynneth's forces were occupied with scuffles elsewhere, the population of Cuardin, a small farming community adjoining a surrounding forest of the Vale, spotted the advancing raiders.

Inspired by the speech of a [[goat]] herder named [[Shod]], the farmers decided to repay Chauntea for their consistently bountiful harvests, and wielded their tools in preparation for a battle they expected to lose. However, their act of devotion came to the attention of their goddess, who decided to assist her faithful in this conflict. This assistance manifested as three birds of prey, each holding a piece of grain: a [[hawk]] with [[rye]], an [[owl]] with [[alfalfa]], and an [[eagle]] with [[wheat]].

Shortly before the battle commenced, these three birds descended, dropping their pieces of grain on three farmers' tools. The hawk dropped its rye on a [[shovel]] wielded by the powerful but quiet [[Gabe]], the owl dropped its alfalfa on a [[pitchfork]] in the hands of the old stable worker [[Boric]], and the eagle dropped its wheat on Shod's [[shepherd staff]]. Empowered by these blessed weapons, the farmers managed to defeat the raiding Northlanders with only some casualties.
