        "mainbody": "Diamond shields were a type of shield typical of the Shoon Imperium.\nThese shields, whose name came from their typical shape made of four isosceles triangles, were meant to protect the off-hand forearm and upper-arm of a combatant. They were usually reinforced by a  strip of metal riveted along their edge.\n*Kuraltaar and twelve other demonshields were magical diamond shields containing bound fiends. They were created by Halaster Blackcloak during the 1 century DR."
