'''Wands''' were spellcasting implements commonly used by [[artificer]]s, [[bard]]s, [[warlock]]s, and [[wizard]]s alike. Usually constructed from wood, many wands typically had [[arcane magic|arcane]] energies of their own. Sometimes this energy allowed the caster to simply empower their [[spell]]s, while other wands possessed the ability to cast their own.

==Description==
Typical wands were usually 15 in (38 cm) long and were made of metal, wood, or bone. They were commonly tipped with some different material, such as crystal, metal, or stone.

==Creation==
[[Gem]]s were often added to wands to increase their wand's effectiveness. Normally, crafting stronger wands required more spellcasting skills from the crafter, which he or she may not possess. Typically, crafting any kind of magic item burnt some of the inner essence of the crafter, and the stronger the item the greater the toll on the caster. Adding a gem was a way to increase the effectiveness of a wand without sacrificing the full amount of one's own essence.

==Powers==
The primary use of wands was to channel the spellcasting powers of spellcasters such as [[bard]]s, [[druid]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s or [[wizard]]s, aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using a wand as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary material components required for a spell. While arcane casters could in general use a piece of any type of wood as a wand, druids in particular tended to prefer wands made of [[yew]] or other special woods.
