The air screw was an experimental and dangerous flying machine developed by Nadul DaRoni.
Inspired by waterspouts, Nadul created the air screw to achieve non-magical flight. The user was intended to sit astride a set of pedals and furiously pump their legs, turning a huge screw that caused a rush of wind. Ideally, this would cause the air screw to slowly rise up vertically in the air, with no horizontal control possible. Despite the ingenuity of the device, even the strongest and most determined of aeronauts were almost certain to lose power and crash shortly after take-off (though exceptionally light folk such as gnomes and halflings may have actually had a chance to make it work).
Following the development of the air screw, Nadul then worked on the somewhat more complicated and effective doubles wheel flying machine.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered the air screw built by Nadul DaRoni, valued at 75 gp. He believed that with sufficient strength and skill, it could be perfectly usable.
