A tent was a simple portable shelter designed for outdoor and wild environments.
Typical tents were made of canvas held standing by wooden poles and hempen rope that could be disassembled and packed during travels. Most tents could hold two occupants, but there were larger varieties.
Two-person and six-person tents were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. 
The largest type of tent was known as a pavilion. They were  large, open-air canopies that could comfortably fit around twenty medium-sized humanoids.

* Khreima a conical tent with a triangular floor plan that was unique to the nomadic Bedine tribes of Anauroch. They were typically woven from the thick hairs of camels and dyed by means of henna, rubbed coffee-grounds, or other rubbed juices. Occasionally they were decorated with patterns or tribal symbols. A khreima was typically held up by wooden poles in each of its three corners, that were connected to a triangle of ceiling-poles and a triangle of floor-poles that hooked or pegged into the tents carpet. These poles often featured hooks, upon which garments or weapons would be hung. Occasionally blankets or garments were hung from the ceiling-poles to create "walls" within a tent. The leaders of a tribe lived within pavillion-sized versions of these tents.
