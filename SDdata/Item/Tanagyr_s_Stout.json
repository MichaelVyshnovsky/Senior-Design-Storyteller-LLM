        "Trade": "It was one of a scant few items exempted from trade embargoes against [[Zhentil Keep]]. Long confined to the Moonsea, it was traded to the south in the mid–14th century [[DR]], sold in unmarked barrels to escape the stigma of that area.",

        "Availability": "Found throughout the Moonsea, Tanagyr's Stout could be enjoyed in the [[Wet Wizard]] of [[Llorkh]], the [[Savage Frontier]], and in the [[Nashkel Inn]] of [[Amn]], where it was priced at two [[gold]] [[coin]]s."
