The Kingdom of Lions was an ancient Zakharan text written in Old Anwahran.
The cover of the tome was decorated with the symbol of Anwahran kingshipâ€“a golden lion displayed on a malachite green field. The book was magically warded to preserve it over the centuries.
Written by Azaltin ibn Issad, the Kingdom of Lions chronicled the history of Al-Anwahr up to the revolution led by Azaltins brother Amakim.
Fearing the tomes discovery by a vizer named Zeenab, Azaltin carefully hid the tome.
