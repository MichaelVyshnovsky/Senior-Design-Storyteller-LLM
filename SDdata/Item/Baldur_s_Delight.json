        "mainbody": "'''Baldur's Delight''' was a type of dessert treat from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]], a fabled creation of Mother Baldur.\n\n{{quote|''Aha! Something from my mother's mother's father! A real whiz around pots and pans. Wait, I said that wrong.''|[[Dradeel]]}}",
        "Description": "The recipe for Baldur's Delight called for five tablespoons of [[cornstarch]], half a cup of hot water, half a cup of cold water, half a cup of [[orange]] juice, two cups of [[sugar]], a small amount of [[lemon]] juice or some other exotic flavoring such as [[rosewater]], and lastly, two cups of nuts, the more exotic the better.\n\nThe directions began with making a mixture of cornstarch and cold water. Then, in a separate bowl, it called for mixing hot water, orange juice, and sugar on heat and bringing it to a boil, and then mixing the cornstarch liquid in. Following that, the liquid was to simmer for fifteen minutes and stirred often. When removed from heat, the recipe called for the nuts and lemon juice to be added in, as well as additional flavoring. The entire mix was then placed on a greased sheet pan and chilled. After the treat solidified, it needed to be cut into small cubes and dusted with powdered sugar and other sprinklings.",
        "History": "The recipe for Baldur's Delight was recorded in the recipe book of Dradeel's during his accommodations within the [[Spellhold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. The recipe came from the man's own family, three generations past."
