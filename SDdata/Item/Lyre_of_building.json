        "Description": "These lyres were indistinguishable in appearance from a ''[[cli lyre]]''. They typically weighed around {{SI|5|lb|long=yes}}.",
        "Powers": "Due to the enchantments put upon them, a ''lyre of building'' was indistinguishable from a mundane lyre. They carried a faunt [[aura]] of [[transmutation]] and required attunement. There were both proper and improper chords on a ''lyre of building'' and activating its effects required strumming the correct ones.\n\nOnce per day, when the proper negatory chords on a ''lyre of building'' were strum, it would negate any damage from a ''[[horn of blasting]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'' [[spell]], an [[earth elemental]] attack, a [[battering ram]] or similar [[siege weapon]] that was being inflicted upon an inanimate structure. This included such things as floors, walls, roofs, etc. This effect spanned an effective range of {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} and would persist for up to 30 minutes.\n\nAdditionally, once per week, if the proper chords were strum a ''lyre of building'' could magically construct any manner of building or structure, including ditches, mines, tunnels, and to build or repair ships and [[spelljammer]]s.<ref> Within but thirty minutes of playing a ''lyre of building'' to this purpose, one could accomplish work equivalent to that of a hundred [[human]]s laboring over three days.\n\nAdditionally, the music of a ''lyre of building'' had the power to offset the entrancing call of a [[harpy]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/115/The Ecology of the Harpy: ...Songs of death|53}} If one of false chords a ''lyre of building'' were ever struck, there was a small chance that all of its effects would turn negated. They also could not function underwater, unless played in some form of air-filled sac, like that produced by the ''[[airy water]]'' spell.<ref> Like most magical instruments, it was believed that the effects of a ''lyre of building'' would double in effectiveness when employed in the hands of a proper [[bard]].<ref><ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], a ''lyre of building'' could negate nearly any form of damage upon a structure within {{SI|300|ft}} of it. They also enabled their wielders to cast ''[[mending]]'' at any time and the power to cast once per dawn the spells ''[[fabricate]]'', ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', and ''[[summon construct]]''.",
        "Construction": "Creating a ''lyre of building'' required a mundane lyre and the spell ''fabricate''.",
