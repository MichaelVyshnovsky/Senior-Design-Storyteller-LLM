        "mainbody": "The '''''Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] that originated from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]]. It was one of the empire's numerous creations that exemplified the hubris and arrogance of the [[Netherese]]: its purpose was to strip the power of the [[god]]s, by banishing the influence they held over the people of [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "The scepter was crafted from a strange, unidentified blue metal. It was topped with two prominent horns that curved toward one another, with a hollow circlet on its other end. It had the same approximate weight and size as a [[heavy mace]].",
        "Powers": {
            "Divine Power": "The scepter's most dominant power was actually its curse. Whenever its powers were used, the influence of a single random deity was stricken from the world, not including any moons, for a full [[tenday]]. That deity became unable to see, communicate with, or otherwise influence any living things, or alter the course of events, in the world on which the scepter was used. Additionally, devotees of that deity were unable to access any [[divine spell]]s granted through prayer or other means. However, deities that had [[magic]] within their area of control (such as [[Mystra]], [[Azuth]], and others) were immune."
        },
        "History": "The ''Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings'' was crafted by the great [[arcanist]] [[Glaeros Lhaerimm]], in a process that involved the sacrifice of dozens of his apprentice mages.\n\nThe willful abuse of life used to create the scepter―and the threat it posed to divine powers―attracted the ire of [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese gods]]. Those gods dispatched their servants to stop Glaeros, before the scepter was completed. In the end, the gods emerged triumphant: Glaeros was slain, and the ''Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings'' was left incomplete. It was eventually seized by some other powerful arcanist.\n\nOver the following centuries, the scepter found its way into the possession of several powerful [[mage]]s and tyrannical despots.\n\nSome time during or before the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings'' was wielded by the [[lich]] [[Thavverdasz]], the self-proclaimed \"Harper King\".",
        "Reputation": "Many deities of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] instructed their followers to readily identify the ''Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings'', so as to ensure their divine influence over the Realms continued unimpeded.\n\nIt was rumored that the scepter could be only be destroyed by using it to outright kill a god, destroying all the Netherese [[lich]]es on Toril, or forcing the gods to abandon the world and remove themselves from the affairs of mortal beings."
