Grave touched mail was a set of chainmail armor imbued with necromantic enchantments.
This sturdy unpleasant-smelling set of magic armor possessed a +2 enchantment and dramatically improved the wearers fortitude. Additionally, grave touched mail allowed the wearer to cast the ghoul touch spell once per day.
As of the , a set of grave touched mail was worn by an unidentified corpse buried in a shallow grave just outside the town of Elmwood in the Moonsea. Whoever buried the body did not do a good job, and any observant traveler could notice the makeshift grave.
