==Powers==
This sturdy unpleasant-smelling set of magic armor possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and dramatically improved the wearer's fortitude. Additionally, ''grave touched mail'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[ghoul touch]]'' [[spell]] once per day.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a set of ''grave touched mail'' was worn by an unidentified corpse buried in a shallow grave just outside the town of [[Elmwood]] in the [[Moonsea]]. Whoever buried the body did not do a good job, and any observant traveler could notice the makeshift grave. Whether the item's enchantments were a result of the previous owner's grim fate or came from some enchanted who created the chainmail remained a mystery.
