        "mainbody": "'''Cable''' was a term describing several distinct manufactured products, similar to common [[rope]], though on occasion was confusingly also used to refer to common rope.",
        "Description": "The most common use of cable referred to immensely thick and strong ropes, such as thigh-thick hawsers used for mooring and anchoring large [[ship]]s or the lines used to support the movements of massive mechanisms.\n\nA less common form of cable found in the [[Realms]] was a thinner, lighter construction made of a thick twisted [[wire]] with rope woven around it. It was extremely strong for its weight, able to hold surprising amounts of weight, and highly resistant to cutting thanks to the core.\n\nA rare form of cable was wholly made of metal or another material, without including any woven rope.{{Cite dragon/220/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Elven magic|82}}{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|?|4}}",
        "Availability": "* [[Tantras]] was a center of rope production, and thick hawser cables could be had for 150 [[gp]] per {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} (this was the exorbitant price set by shops when a ship cable was required immediately in emergency, rather than ordered normally).{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/General Facts on Tantras}}\n* [[Urcandle Alley]] in [[Waterdeep]] sold all manner of ropes, including thick cables.\n* [[Nueth's Fine Nets]] in Waterdeep sold a variety of useful implements used on ships, including thin, [[wax]]ed, wire-cored climbing cable favored by [[thieves]] for 30 [[gp]] per {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}.\n* The [[Chandlers Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] oversaw the city's maritime tools and equipment, including the development of new kinds of wired cable.\n* [[Rallogar Hardware]] in [[Wheloon]] sold tools and supplies, including rope, cable, and wire.",
        "Notable Instances": "* [[Winch]]ed heavy cables installed by [[dwarf|dwarven]] artisans were used to guide and control the passage of shipping on the [[River Chionthar]] at [[Berdusk]], as the [[Breaking Steps]] rapids nearby made normal water travel impossible.\n* The [[earthmote]]s of [[Airspur]] were connected by suspension bridges that used metal cabling.\n* The bridge to [[Sadrach's Splinter]] was supported by crystalline cables.",
        "Magic": "* Spells that were normally used with ropes such as ''[[bind]]'', ''[[knot]]'', ''[[tie]]'', and ''[[animate rope]]'' could manipulate even very heavy cables.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards}}\n* A ''[[rod of sylvan prowess]]'' could launch a line of [[steel]] cable, intended to affix to a surface and carry people and cargo.",
        "History": "Wire-cored cable was first developed in the Realms around the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
