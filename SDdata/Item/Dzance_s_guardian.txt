'''''Dzance's guardian''''' was a [[magic]]al [[shield]] of unknown origin, though it was believed to be [[dwarven]] in craft.

==Powers==
The shield enveloped its bearer in an aura that deflected ''[[magic missile]]s'' and absorbed magical electricity, such as that from ''[[shocking grasp]]''. The latter effect would remain in the shield and, if its wielder so desired, could be discharged at nearby foes. When this occurred, there was about a one-in-three chance the shield and its wielder would be shifted into a random [[plane of existence]].

==History==
The shield was discovered in the depths of [[Gauntlgrym]] by the [[ranger]] [[Dzance]]. Upon his retirement in [[Silverymoon]], he bestowed it to a young knight named [[Belpir]]. Upon leaving for adventure, Belpir, and the shield, have not been seen since.
