The '''''Perfect Charm of Lolth''''' was a unique sword knot, a charm to be attached to a [[weapon]], part of a set alongside the ''[[Perfect Fang of Lolth]]'', forged deep in the [[Demonweb Pits]], the [[Abyss]]al layer ruled by [[Lolth]], The Demon Queen of Spiders.

==Description==
The ''Perfect Charm'' was an ornate charm decorated with ancient magical runes of the Demonweb Pits.

==Powers==
This powerful [[Lolthite]] weapon knot was created to rend the souls of the enemies of the Spider Queen. Its powers increased when it was wielded alongside the ''Perfect Fang of Lolth''. The ''Perfect Charm'' magically shielded its wielder from incoming damage when their stamina was exhausted during battle. At the beginning of each battle, the charm increased the wielder's chance of dealing increased damage with a lucky or well-aimed attack.

The knot's magic made it usable by [[barbarian]]s only.

==History==
The ''Perfect Fang of Lolth'' and the ''Perfect Charm of Lolth'' were forged in eons past deep in the Demonweb Pits. The items found their way to the [[Prime Material plane]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], possibly ending up in the hands of [[drow]] and [[adventurer]]s of the [[Northdark]] who challenged the [[beholder]] [[deity]] [[Gzemnid]], or barbarians who survived a descent into the Demonweb Pits and a battle with Lolth herself.
