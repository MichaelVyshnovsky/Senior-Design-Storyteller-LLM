'''''Honor's Edge''''' were [[enchanted]] [[kama]] created to fight the creatures of law and order.

==Powers==
''Honor's Edge'' was enhanced with a simple ''+3'' enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the kama dealt additional damage to creatures who venerated law. ''Honor's Edge'' also possessed a ''[[keen]]'' blade that ensured devastating damage done with well-aimed slashes. Additionally, the weirder was granted the ability to cast the ''[[magic circle against alignment]]'' thrice per day.

==History==
Unsurprisingly, ''Honor's Edge'' was once a tool used by peasants in the fields, later adapted to be used in battle because they were forbidden from wielding [[sword]]s. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands.
