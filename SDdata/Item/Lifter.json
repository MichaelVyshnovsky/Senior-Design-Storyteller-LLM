        "mainbody": "lifter was a magical transportation device used by beholders to move people and cargo.\nThe lifter was a large disk-shaped platform up to  across, enchanted with a basic autonomous levitation effect. They were often heavily decorated with ornamental inlays and enameled designs of popular beholder artistic subjects, such as beholder eyeballs.\nA lifter would float in place by default and could be programmed with a pre-set weight limit, whereupon it would begin gradually changing altitude. It would stop when a rider spoke the command word, or it came within  of a ceiling. Lifters were often placed in vertical tunnels that were only a few inches wider than the disk, in order to be used as elevators."
