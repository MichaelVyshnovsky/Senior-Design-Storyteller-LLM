The '''voulge''' was a popular [[polearm]] variation on the [[axe]] and [[cleaver]], variously classified within either the poleaxe family of weapons<ref> or the family of polearms that were derived from agricultural tools.
==Description==
Voulges consisted of a long, stout shaft, measuring {{SIrange|7|8|ft|long=yes}} in length, mounted at the end with a large heavy cleaving blade. Sometimes the top front or back edge of this blade was ground down, giving it a narrowed spiked tip and a hook-shaped fluke at its rear.

==Weaponology==
[[File:Group of Polearms (2) 2nd edition.png|thumb|270px|''A voulge stands in the center-right of a group of polearms.'']]
The cleaving head of a voulge was used for the purpose of cleaving through armor, aided by the leverage which their poles gave. Those that featured a spiked tip or fluke at their end were better suited for keeping enemies at a distance. And the spiked tip of a voulge was also used for piercing through armor. They required two hands to wield.<ref>{{Cite dragon/127/Two Hands Are Better Than One|34}}

They were relatively easy to craft and simple to learn how to wield, But they were one of the slowest varieties of polearms.

==Availability==
* The [[Weaponers of Cormyr]] sold voulges among their many types of polearms.

==History==
The design of the voulge was originally derived from peasants fastening [[meat cleaver]]s to the end of [[staves]] to form makeshift polearms.

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Ravenian]] merchant [[Bendekar]] had multiple voulges in his [[Bendekar's House|home's]] expansive weapons collection.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Handful of Dust|37}}
* Voulges were sometimes utilized by [[ninja]]s.<ref>
