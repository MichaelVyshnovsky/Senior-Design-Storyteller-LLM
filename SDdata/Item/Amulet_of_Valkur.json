        "mainbody": "An '''''amulet of Valkur''''' was a [[magic item]] prepared with the ''[[favor of Valkur]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Powers": "These amulets stored the ''favor of [[Valkur]]'' spell, allowing the wearer to activate the spell on themselves even if they lacked spellcasting abilities. The spell itself would ensure that if the individual ever fell overboard while at sea that they would safely reach the shore before perishing by drowning, dehydration or starvation.\n\nAn ''amulet of Valkur'' could be created only by a powerful [[priest]] of Valkur. The magic stored within an ''amulet of Valkur'' expired five years after it was created. These items could usually be purchased for 2,000–4,000 [[gp]]."
