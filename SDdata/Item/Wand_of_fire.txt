A '''''wand of fire''''' was an enchanted [[wand]] that contained several flame-based powers.

==Powers==
These wands replicated the effects of the following [[wizard]] [[spell]]s: ''[[ burning hands]]'', ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', and ''[[wall of fire]]''. A single charge was consumed when ''burning hands'' and ''pyrotechnics'' were used, and two chargers were consumed when ''fireball'' and ''wall of fire'' were used. These wands could be recharged.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Ali al-Lazan]], a notorious [[Elemental mage|flame mage]] with the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]], carried a ''wand of fire''.
* [[Xithiss]], a [[mindflayer]] who worked for [[Baeloth Barrityl]] in his coliseum the [[Black Pits]].
* Some of the crew of the pirate ship ''[[Scarlet Picaro]]'' carried ''wands of fire''.<ref>
