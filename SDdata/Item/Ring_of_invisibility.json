One in ten rings of invisibility also made the wearer inaudible. A wearer of one of the inaudible variants could speak if they desired, but would cease the inaudible function of the ring for that moment.\nThey remained in this state until they removed the ring, cast a spell, or attacked any person or creature.\nThe ring had an unlimited number of uses.\nA cursed ring of invisibility could simply disappear at inopportune times or make only the wearer invisible, not their clothing and carried items.\nTo make a ring of invisibility, one required skill in forging rings and the spell invisibility. The silver used should also be pure or from an existing ring of invisibility.\n* Sandthiefs ring A number of these rings were used by the Waterdhavian master thief known as the Sand Thief.\n* Tipsy Toehammer An extremely lucky but lazy halfling thief, active in the 14 century DR.\n* Zain, a spy and assassin in service of the ruler of Hillsfar circa 1374 DR.\n* Tevlo Spath, a private detective of Spath Investigations in Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 1300s DR.\n* Senior members of the Church of Mask often wore rings of invisibility."
