Shells were the hard exoskeletons of creatures that found use in artwork or more practical applications.
The shells of certain saltwater and freshwater molluscs, as well as some amphibian carapaces were highly valued. This was for their ability to be carved into artistic items such as cameos and jewelry, but rarely used for currency because prices varied wildly with scarcity, fashion, and geography. Large, unblemished specimens could demand high prices from collectors and craftsmen but flawed pieces were generally worthless. Collectors might have paid more for unusual specimens, but any flaws quickly reduced the price.
