A '''''griffon lancesaddle''''' was a [[magic item]] that contained several extradimensional pockets.

==Description==
This item was an exotic [[saddle]] specifically made for a [[griffon]]. Six small leather cylinders were affixed to the saddle. Each was about the size of a [[scroll]] tube.

==Powers==
Each of the leather cylinders was capable of storing a heavy [[lance]] or item of similar size. The rider of the saddle could mentally command the cylinders to produce the desired item at will.
