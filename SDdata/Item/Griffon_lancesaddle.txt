A griffon lancesaddle was a magic item that contained several extradimensional pockets.
This item was an exotic saddle specifically made for a griffon. Six small leather cylinders were affixed to the saddle. Each was about the size of a scroll tube.
Each of the leather cylinders was capable of storing a heavy lance or item of similar size. The rider of the saddle could mentally command the cylinders to produce the desired item at will.
