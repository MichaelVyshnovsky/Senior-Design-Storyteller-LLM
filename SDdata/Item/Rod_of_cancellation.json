        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of cancellation''''' was a powerful [[magic item]] that drained other magic items of their enchantments.",
        "Powers": "For a ''rod of cancellation'' to drain the power from another magic item, the ''rod'' needed to physically touch the target item. Once drained, a magic item could never have its lost powers restored even via a ''[[wish]]''. A ''rod of cancellation'' became brittle and useless once its power was used successfully.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Thardock]], who was an officer in the [[Purple Dragons]], carried a ''rod of cancellation''."
