Scabbards of blessing were enchanted blade sheaths originally created for a paladin order..
Scabbards of blessing were crated a long time ago by a religious order whose name has been lost to time. This divine item could grant the user ability to cast aid and bless three times a day.
Even though these scabbards were created to be used by good clerics and paladins, anyone could tap into its magic, be they of good or evil alignment.
