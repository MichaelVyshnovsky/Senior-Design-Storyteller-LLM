        "mainbody": "'''Kabuto''' was a type of [[helmet]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "The kabuto was a helmet commonly worn alongside the [[o-yoroi]]. It was crafted by riveting together strips of [[iron]], forming a bowl-shaped sturdy structure. Typically, there was a small aperture at the crown where the plates converged. The helmet featured a flowing neckguard that extended from the back and sides, gracefully curving outward into two wing-like sections at the front. Elaborate crests adorned the frontal portion of the helmet, showcasing designs such as horns, antlers, leaping fish, or crescent moons. To secure the entire assembly, vibrant red [[silk]] cords were employed.\n\nThe kabuto served as one of the most prominent components of a warrior's armor, catching the eye on the battlefield. Often, it was exquisitely embellished and took on fantastical shapes. Unconventional forms included those resembling demonic faces, seashells, thunderbolt-clenching fists, tall cones, fish, or wild animals. Some kabuto were adorned with [[human]] hair or furs. The helmet's bowl was frequently adorned with [[silver]], [[copper]], and [[gold]] accents, while the neckguard was intricately laced on the exterior and covered with dyed or painted leathers on the interior."
