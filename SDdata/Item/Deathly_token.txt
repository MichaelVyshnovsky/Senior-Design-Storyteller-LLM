A deathly token was a magic item that enabled the bearer to use ask questions of the dead, and receive responses.

The token depicted the holy symbol of Kelemvor, the god of death and the dead, that is, a skeletal arm and hand holding a set of balanced scales. It was set within a ring. Letters in the Thorass alphabet inscribed on the ring read "INQUISITORE • VIVITATUM • ENCRONIMUS".
As with the spell speak with dead, the token animated a corpse in a limited fashion to answer questions for the caster, based only on what it had known in life. Only five questions were permitted and these could be asked by anyone present. Afterward, the corpse would return to death and could not be raised by the deathly token again. Otherwise, its duration could be length.
The command words for the deathly token were perlamon tergatys.

For a time in the 1490s DR, Simon Aumar apprenticed with a cleric of Kelemvor. From this priest, he acquired his deathly token.The clerics deity is unspecified, but is assumed to be Kelemvor based on his holy symbol on the token.
At the Evermoors cemetery in the late 1490s DR, Edgin Darvis, Simon Aumar, Doric, and Holga Kilgore dug up the corpses of fallen Elk tribe warriors and used Simons deathly token to question them in order to learn the fate of the helmet of disjunction. The eternal rest of Stanhard Grimwulf, Toke Horgath, Sven Salafin, Ven Salafin, and others were all disturbed for the sake of a few questions, mistaken identities, and misused spellcasting.
