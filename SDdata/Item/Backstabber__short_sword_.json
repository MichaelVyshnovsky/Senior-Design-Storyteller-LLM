        "Description": "''Backstabber's'' blade was of jet black color and was significantly slimmer than other short swords.",
        "Powers": "''Backstabber'' was beautifully balanced, allowing the wielder to land hits with this weapon much easier than with another short sword. This slender blade also had a ''+2'' enchantment and increased the user's dexterity.",
        "History": "''Backstabber'' belonged to a young rogue Tudo who, won a dare, traveled from [[Hillsfar]] to [[Myth Drannor]] to bring back a piece of [[Castle Cormanthor]] in 1369 DR. He was spotted and imprisoned by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] deep in the Castle's prisons. ''Backstabber'' along with his master worked to bring down the Cult's operation after they were rescued from the prison cell."
