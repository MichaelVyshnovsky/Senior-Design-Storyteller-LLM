This slender blade also had a +2 enchantment and increased the users dexterity.\nBackstabber belonged to a young rogue Tudo who, won a dare, traveled from Hillsfar to Myth Drannor to bring back a piece of Castle Cormanthor in 1369 DR. He was spotted and imprisoned by the Cult of the Dragon deep in the Castles prisons. Backstabber along with his master worked to bring down the Cults operation after they were rescued from the prison cell."
