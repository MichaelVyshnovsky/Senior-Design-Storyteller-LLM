The horned rings were eight enchanted rings that the mad wizard Halaster created for himself and his seven apprentices.
These iron rings had small horns rising out of them that curved backward toward the wearers fingers.
Halaster imbued each of the eight horned rings with distinct powers and immunities, only accessible by the individual they were designed for. Anyone else who wore one of these rings had access to only one or more powers.
The most common power of the horned rings was similar to Halasters teleportation rings or the greater teleport spell, but teleported the wearer to different locations within Undermountain. The wearer was also able to specify where they wished to teleport. Following the Spellplague, this was the only power of the rings available to laypeople.
The ring could break through any magical barriers, with the exception of prismatic walls or prismatic spheres, to get them there safely, allowing it to bypass Halasters teleport cage. And the wearer could cloak themselves upon command in an antimagic aura.
In order to recharge itself, a horned ring would absorb any incoming magic missiles and magical and natural electrical energy directed at the wearer. The wearer was completely protected from attacks of these kinds while wearing a horned ring.
* Garrik Oakspear, Halasters chief spy during the midâ€“14 century DR, had a horned ring in his possession.
* Halaster Blackcloak, the creator of the horned rings.
* A helmed horror, hidden away in a secret room on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain, had a horned ring on its right gauntlet in 1358 DR. When a group of adventurers eventually came across the helmed horror, it extended its gauntlet out and offered them the ring.
* Iyrauroth, a powerful black dragon from Thar, had one of the horned rings in his possession in 1373 DR.
* Jhesiyra Kestellharp, one of the seven former apprentices of Halaster, had a horned ring in her possession prior to her disappearance. but in actuality it was still in her possession.
* Maddgoth had a horned ring in his possession in the 15 century DR.
* Muiral, one of the seven apprentices of Halaster, had a horned ring in his possession.
Rumors abounded that the horned rings allowed Halaster to remotely view their wearer and read their thoughts.
