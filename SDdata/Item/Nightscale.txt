}}'''Nightscale''' armor was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Nightscale was similar to [[leather armor]], but it was made from dark [[snake|snakeskin]]. It was treated with numerous alchemical mixtures making it more supple and formfitting. It was often favored by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s. Nightscale was typically made in the [[Underdark]].
