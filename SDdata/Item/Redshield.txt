The Redshield was an enchanted shield that was the personal shield of Rhaumon Bloodaxe. It was wielded alongside the Bloodaxe.
The Redshield had a +2 enchantment, just slightly less enchanted that its companion battleaxe.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, many undead beings watched over the resting place of the First Axe of Ruathym, Rhaumon Bloodaxe. Patrolling the mansion to the northwest of Ruathym, they would attack intruders on sight, making it difficult for anyone to access the magical axe and shield that lay there.
