Sea chips was a seafood dish from Ravens Bluff.
Sea chips were made from cod that was pressed into small, flat pieces, then fried in oil, not unlike frites.
Sea chips were served to great acclaim at the Sharks Finn tavern in Ravens Bluff, alongside other seafood dishes such as cod stew and deviled crab, thanks to the fugitive cook Caleni.
