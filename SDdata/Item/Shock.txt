'''''Shock''''' was a [[weapon quality]]. With a command, a shock weapon became sheathed in crackling electricity. Any creature hit by the weapon took damage from the electricity in addition to the damage the weapon did.

==Creation==
A spellcaster needed the ''[[call lightning]]'' or ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spells to create a weapon with this ability.

==Uses==
Some experienced [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of ''shock''. 

[[Helmed horror]]s could enhance their blades with magical qualities including ''shock'' among others.
