An '''''everburning torch''''' was simply an ordinary [[torch]] enchanted by the ''[[continual flame]]'' spell, such that it burned constantly with a heatless flame that required no oxygen or fuel.

==Description==
An ''everburning torch'' cast light out to a distance of about 40 feet (12 meters). It weighed about 1 pound (0.5 kilograms) and sold for about 110 [[gold piece]]s in most places. The light from the flame could be covered and hidden but not extinguished.

==History==
There are many examples of ''everburning torches'' in the Realms by the early 1370s [[DR]]. They provided light to the great stairwells of the tree-temple of [[Teumyshaaril]] within the [[elven]] city of [[Teuveamanthaar]] in the [[High Forest]]. Ensconced ''everburning torches'' illuminated the interior of the [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]].<ref> The [[Shadovar]] used them to light the quarters of their [[earth genasi]] slaves during their excavation of the [[Crypt of Augathra the Mad]]. The Temple of Bane buried beneath [[Castle Krag]] in [[Shadowdale]] was lit by green ''everburning torches''. Captain [[Serag Kull]] of [[Hillsfar]] carried such a torch among his possessions.
