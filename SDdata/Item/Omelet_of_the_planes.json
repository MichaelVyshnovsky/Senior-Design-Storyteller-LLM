        "Description": "It was contained inside a carton of some whitish material called \"[[Wikipedia:Polystyrene#Expanded_polystyrene_(EPS)|styrofoam]]\", embossed with the logo of something called an \"airline\". The omelet itself was old, chewy, and tasteless, and most certainly cold.\n\nIt was conveniently accompanied by a wax-coated paper bag.",
        "Powers": "It was an omelet.\n\nIf someone actually dared to eat it, they would need to show some strong intestinal fortitude or else be forced to use the paper bag.\n\nCuriously, if someone actually did succeed in eating it, on the very next day the box would be found to contain an identical, if not the exact same, omelet. It wasn't any better. This was apparently normal for airline food.\n\nIf not eaten, the ''omelet of the planes'' only got worse with time.",
        "Value": "It was valued at either 5,000 [[gp]] or 6 [[gp]] or less."
