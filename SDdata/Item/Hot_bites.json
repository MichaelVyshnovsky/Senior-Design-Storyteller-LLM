        "mainbody": "Hot bites were a type of open-faced sandwich eaten as an appetizer, from the town of Hills Edge in the Sunset Vale.\nHot bites were made out of pieces of sliced, or even stale bread. The bread was soaked in white wine and left to dry. Once the bread was dried, it was smeared in hot mustard and topped with cheese and onion or leeks. Lastly, the sandwiches were sprinkled with basil, pepper, drizzled with white wine, and fried on a skillet to melt the cheese. Hot bites were eaten hot.\nHot bites were served at The Happy Hippocampus Inn in Hills Edge in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The hot bite was one of the foods that greatly impressed master traveler Volothamp Geddarm and received a glowing review in Volos Guide to the Sword Coast. With the help of the inns cook Alayss, Volo was able to publish the dishs recipe in said guidebook."
