A staff of command was a magic item capable of influencing others.
Staves of command had three functions and were most effective if wielded by clerics since they had access to all three powers. The staff granted the wielder the charm person and suggestion abilities to be used against humans. Against animals the staff granted the mammal control ability if used by a wizard and the animal control ability if used by a cleric. Lastly, clerics were able to control plant life within a  square.
Each use of the staff depleted a single charged. Staves of command could be recharged.
Gina bint Kemala, a mystic from Huzuz, carried a staff of command.
