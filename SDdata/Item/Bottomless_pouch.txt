A '''''bottomless pouch''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[pouch]] that could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''bottomless pouch'' contained an extra-dimensional space similar to a ''[[bag of holding]]'', but it was much more valuable in combat as it allowed the owner to use it to flexibly change plans and launch counterattacks.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Jarlaxle]], the legendary [[drow]] leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], owned several extra-dimensional storage spaces, including a ''bottomless pouch'', a ''bag of holding'', a ''[[portable hole]]'', and a ''[[foldable chest]]''.
