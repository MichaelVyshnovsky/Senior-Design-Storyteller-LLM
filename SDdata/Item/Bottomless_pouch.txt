A bottomless pouch was an enchanted pouch that could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
The bottomless pouch contained an extra-dimensional space similar to a bag of holding, but it was much more valuable in combat as it allowed the owner to use it to flexibly change plans and launch counterattacks.
* Jarlaxle, the legendary drow leader of Bregan Daerthe, owned several extra-dimensional storage spaces, including a bottomless pouch, a bag of holding, a portable hole, and a foldable chest.
