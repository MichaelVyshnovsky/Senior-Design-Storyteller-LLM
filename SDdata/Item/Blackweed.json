        "mainbody": "Blackweed was a highly potent poison known in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.Blackweed is presumably extracted from a plant of the same name, but no such plant is known.\nIn its pure form, it was a pale yellow fluid. A concentrated dose of blackweed poison had a quite a distinct odor,\nbut it dissolved unnoticeably in water.\nA slow-acting poison, following ingestion, blackweed had no immediate effects on a victim. After 12 hours or more, however, they would begin to feel pains, growing from irritating to agonizing. In under 24 hours, the victim would be dead. A small vial of blackweed to sufficient to slay a whole townful of people.\nIn Eleint of the , the Iron Throne provided two vials of blackweed to two of its spies in Cormyr, kings envoy Grodoveth and Mayor Tobald of Ghars, along with orders to poison the village water supply via its cistern. This was part of a plot to assassinate the visiting Grand Council of the Merchants Guild of Cormyr—and incidentally the towns entire population—and thereby benefit the Iron Thrones interests in Sembia and fill the vacancies left in Cormyr.\nFortunately, during a medical examination on Eleint 18, the retired War Wizard Benelaius found the vial in Tobalds cloak, identified it by its odor, cleaned it out, and replaced it with a harmless crystalline powder that glowed in the dark. He had already found and taken Grodoveths vial when he came across his dead body earlier that day.\nAt a midnight gathering on Eleint 19, Benelaius revealed that everyone who had drunk the water of Ghars that day had a glowing mouth, and so exposed Tobald, whod not touched a drop, as the would-be poisoner."
