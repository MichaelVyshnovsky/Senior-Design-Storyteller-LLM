        "mainbody": "'''Blackweed''' was a highly potent [[poison]] known in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].Blackweed is presumably extracted from a plant of the same name, but no such plant is known.",
        "Description": "In its pure form, it was a pale yellow fluid. A concentrated dose of blackweed poison had a quite a distinct odor,\nbut it dissolved unnoticeably in water.",
        "Effects": "A slow-acting poison, following ingestion, blackweed had no immediate effects on a victim. After 12 hours or more, however, they would begin to feel pains, growing from irritating to agonizing. In under 24 hours, the victim would be dead. A small vial of blackweed to sufficient to slay a whole townful of people.",
        "History": "In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the [[Iron Throne]] provided two vials of blackweed to two of its spies in [[Cormyr]], king's envoy [[Grodoveth]] and Mayor [[Tobald]] of [[Ghars]], along with orders to poison the village water supply via its cistern. This was part of a plot to assassinate the visiting Grand Council of the [[Merchants' Guild]] of Cormyr—and incidentally the town's entire population—and thereby benefit the Iron Throne's interests in [[Sembia]] and fill the vacancies left in Cormyr.\n\nFortunately, during a medical examination on [[Eleint 18]], the retired [[War Wizard]] [[Benelaius]] found the vial in Tobald's [[cloak]], identified it by its odor, cleaned it out, and replaced it with a harmless crystalline powder that glowed in the dark. He had already found and taken Grodoveth's vial when he came across his dead body earlier that day.\n\nAt a midnight gathering on [[Eleint 19]], Benelaius revealed that everyone who had drunk the water of Ghars that day had a glowing mouth, and so exposed Tobald, who'd not touched a drop, as the would-be poisoner."
