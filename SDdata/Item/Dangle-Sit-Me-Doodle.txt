The so-called '''Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodle''' were a type of chair, eccentrically designed by the [[gnome]]s of [[Yellow Hills]].

==Description==
Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodles were strange pieces of furniture that could only be spawned by a gnome's mind. These chairs had six arms and three legs for some unknown reson. Some thought them stylish, and some called them most incredible.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodle attracted the attention of an odd and unconventional purveyor of furniture and decorations on the [[Sword Coast]], [[Yani Pavani]]. The loud woman quickly became enamored with strange items. She believed that Dangle-Sit-Me-Doodle were so stylish and preposterous they were sure to become the next big obsession among rich nobles of [[Waterdeep]].
