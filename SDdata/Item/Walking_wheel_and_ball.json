        "mainbody": "walking wheel and ball was a type of item in the Realms popular among bards and acrobats who performed balancing acts upon them.\nThese specialized wheels were made from thick steel in order to support weight. The ball was usually a granite sphere.\nThese items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 4 gold pieces for a wheel and 7 gold pieces for a ball.\n* Walking wheels and balls were favored by bards, particularly in Calimshan."
