A '''hammer''' was an implement ranging in size from tiny jewelery hammers to massive [[warhammer]]s. Certain races preferred to wield hammers, especially [[dwarves]] who made extensive use of these tools in mining their great caverns. The light hammer might be thrown at a target and was thus considered a ranged weapon as well as a melee weapon.

==Description==
Hammers whose use was intended as tools included [[sledgehammer]]s, peg- and tone-setting mallets, spike and chisel hammers, hammers with claws for nail removal, and smithing hammers.

Smithing hammers, in particular, consisted of solid and heavy flat-nosed steel heads with triangular tails to allow for detailed work, attached to a long [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] handle that provided effective thermal isolation.

Several varieties of hammers were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
