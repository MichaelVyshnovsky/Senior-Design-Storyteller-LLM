A hammer was an implement ranging in size from tiny jewelery hammers to massive warhammers. Certain races preferred to wield hammers, especially dwarves who made extensive use of these tools in mining their great caverns. The light hammer might be thrown at a target and was thus considered a ranged weapon as well as a melee weapon.
Hammers whose use was intended as tools included sledgehammers, peg- and tone-setting mallets, spike and chisel hammers, hammers with claws for nail removal, and smithing hammers.
Smithing hammers, in particular, consisted of solid and heavy flat-nosed steel heads with triangular tails to allow for detailed work, attached to a long duskwood handle that provided effective thermal isolation.
Several varieties of hammers were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
