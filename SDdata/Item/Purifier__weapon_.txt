Purifier was a holy avenger bastard sword that could only be recovered and wielded by the more pure and just paladins from amongst the Realms.
Purifier possessed a powerful +4 enchantment and granted its wielder some protection from spells and other magical effects. It was particularly harmful against the most lawless and despicable beings that someone could encounter.
Twice per day, its wielder could dispel away any magical effects that surrounded its wielder.
The imp Cespenar was somewhat familiar with this weapon, and knew it could be improved by setting the jewel known as the Eye of Tyr within its pommel.
It was believed the sword once belonged to the famous paladin Sir Wediyer and lost when he chased down a pit fiend through an extra-planar portal.
While it was believed the Purifier was lost forever, it was in fact embedded into a rock formation found within the labyrinthine third level of Watchers Keep.
According to legend, Purifier was "infused with the very essence of virtue".
