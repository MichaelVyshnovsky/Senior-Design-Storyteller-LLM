The '''vazhan-do''' was a stringed musical instrument of [[drow]] origin.{{Cite dragon/298/Flesh for Lolth: The Secret Life of Dark Elves|29}}

==Description==
The vazhan-do was a [[lute]]-like instrument but it had sixty-four strings. The strings could be plucked or bent to create violent or disturbing sounds.

The strings of the instrument were also designed to be easily and quickly unstrung and could be used as garrote wire. This made the instrument popular with drow assassins who were able to masquerade as [[bard]]s.
