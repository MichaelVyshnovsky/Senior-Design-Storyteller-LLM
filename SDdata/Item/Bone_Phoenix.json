        "Powers": "''Bone Phoenixes'' were enchanted ''+1'' bludgeons that scorched their targets with magical flames upon successful strikes.",
        "History": "The name \"Bone Phoenix\" was a reference to Lord Craghand's grim fate. In life, Craghand lacked any talent in the [[arcane magic|arcane]] and in attempts to prolong his life, a small army of [[necromancer]]s in his employ ensorcelled the lord and his court to a strange type of undeath. The magic bludgeons, however, did not stay with their undying master, and by the late 14{{th}}century, several of the ''Bone Phoenixes'' found their way to the [[Sword Coast]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, High Captain [[Baram]] of [[Luskan]] wielded one of these fiery [[morning star]]s. Another ''Bone Phoenix'' was found in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, lost in a cave not far from the [[Weeping Willow Inn]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]."
