        "mainbody": "arkened Glory was a magical katana from Kara-Tur.\nOnce a graceful blade, Darkened Glory was tainted by dark magic. It had a light blue pommel and guard, while the blade itself was nearly black in appearance.\nThe katana was enchanted to occasionally curse struck enemies.\nDarkened Glory originally belonged to a young Kara-Turan officer guarding the caravan of a diplomatic envoy. When the caravan was ambushed by yuan-ti raiders, the officer was almost immediately the only guard left standing. She defended a single wagon from several waves of yuan-ti attackers, but was ultimately overpowered by their leader. In awe of her skill, the yuan-ti leader recovered her katana. It was later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth."
