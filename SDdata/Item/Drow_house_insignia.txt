A '''''drow house insignia''''' was an item that denoted an individual noble [[drow]]'s allegiance. It was used by nobles holding the noble family name, which meant that they were either born into the family or held a rank in it.

==Description==
A ''drow house insignia'' was often crafted as a brooch with a sculpted image on it. This image was the [[Drow house glyphs|glyph]] of the noble house the drow was attached to.

==Powers==
A ''drow house insignia's'' powers could only be safely employed by someone who received an ''[[attunement]]'' [[spell]], which was part of the [[Attunement (ritual)|attunement]] [[ritual]], which was a well-known fact among priestesses of [[Lolth]]. The powers of an ''insignia'' were activated by touch with bare flesh while concentrating on which power was to be activated or with a command word.

There were a total of three categories of powers that could be activated by the above method, the minor, intermediate, and major powers. The minor powers could be used as often as the user wanted. They usually included four of the following but were not limited to them: ''[[blur]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[shield]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', ''[[unseen servant]]'', ''[[corpselight]]'', ''[[jump]]'', ''[[water walking]]'', and ''[[scatterspray]]''. The intermediate power could be used twice every ten minutes. They usually included four of the following, but were not limited to them: ''[[blink]]'', ''[[protection from cantrips]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[hold undead]]'', ''[[magic mouth]]'', ''[[charm monster|charm House monsters]]'' (an ability that enforced control over magically linked non-drow creatures), ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[cloak from undead]]'', ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[non-detection]]'', ''[[web]]'', and ''[[wizard lock]]'' (useless against those who held other ''insignia''). The major powers had two options of uses. They could be either used once every ten minutes or nine times per day but at the leisure of the user with no cool down time. They usually included four of the following, but were not limited to them: ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[dig]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[illusory wall]]'', ''[[summon monster|monster summoning]]'' (between ''[[Summon monster I|I]]'' to ''[[Summon monster VII|VII]]''), ''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', [[Lesser ironguard|''ironguard'']], ''[[Ilyykur's mantle]]'', ''[[fire shield]]'', and ''[[wraithform]]''. Other common spells included ''[[cat's grace]]'', ''[[cloak of dark power]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', and ''[[shield]]''.

As mentioned above, unattuned people could not use a ''drow house insignia''. If such a person touched or tried to activate a power of it, the ''insignia'' harmed the person with one of various effects like ''[[blindness]]'' for four to sixteen minutes, ''[[feeblemind]]'' for up to twenty-five minutes, a curse, burns that could not be magically healed, loss of voice for two to eight days, or being wracked with pain. A wizard could unlock an ''insignia'' and make it usable by everybody. 

[[Wizard]]s often built secret powers into ''drow house insignia'', which were activated by the wizard's mental command when she or he was within 90 ft (27 m) of the tempered ''insignia'', or when a [[command word]] taught to another person was uttered. They did this to surprise their enemies in a noble family with it in the case of internal conflicts. Some of these powers came in the form of a ''[[dimension door]]'' spell that shunted a person to a place of the wizard's choosing, obscuring smoke like that from ''[[pyrotechnics]]'' spell, becoming unbearably hot like under a ''[[heat metal]]'' spell, to a simple explosion that caused harm to everyone within 20 ft (6 m).

A ''drow house insignia'' was a reliable way to locate an individual, provided the diviner was taught how to trace it&mdash;usually by the Matron Mother, High Priestess, or House Wizard. The wizards, who were also the ''insignia<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' creators, were capable of protecting themselves from such tracing.

''Drow house insignia'' could be equipped on a ''[[driftdisc]]''. This conferred the ''insignia's'' powers to the ''driftdisc''.

==Reputation==
A ''drow house insignia'' was a powerful [[magic item]] and usage of it was regulated. Illicit use of it was enough to be punished with the death penalty. Sometimes, the major power of a given drow noble house was a commonly known fact. An ''insignia'' with multiple abilities was the belonging of a powerful member of a noble house.

As a general rule, a ''drow house insignia'' that was unlocked by a wizard came into the hands of another as battle-booty. The only ones who sold these powerful items were non-drow and they sold it only to other non-drow. A drow never sold such a treasure even when it originated from someone he or she hated.

==Notable Owners==
Drow took special care to keep their ''drow house insignia'' safe. Only the nobles from the First House wore them openly while all others wore them in ways known only to their households.

In the case of an attack, intelligent [[spider]]s that were under some kind of mental control by a [[cleric|priestess]] of [[Lolth]] were equipped with ''drow house insignia''.
