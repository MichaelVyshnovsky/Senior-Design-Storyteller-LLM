Table dice, or backgammon, was a board game played with dice.
The sets sold through Auroras Emporium used polished stone markers, ivory dice, and a leather dice cup. The entire set could be transported in an ironwood case.
Table dice was commonly played as a tavern game in the Dalelands. As of 1359 DR, its popularity had begun to spread to the Western Heartlands and the North.
