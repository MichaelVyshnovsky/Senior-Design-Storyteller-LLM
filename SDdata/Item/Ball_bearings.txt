'''Ball bearings''' were tiny metal balls that were used to hinder pursuers by forcing them to slow down and tread carefully or risk tripping and falling. Glass variants of these balls, known as '''marbles''', were also used for that purpose.

==Description==
A [[pouch]] of 1000 metal ball bearings could be spread over an area equivalent to a square 10 ft (3 m) on a side to provide an effective coverage. A pouch of 24 was sufficient to cover an area of 5 ft.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold marbles in a pouches of a hundred for around 8 [[silver piece]]s.
* [[Galandor's Glassworks]], a glass workshop in [[Kirinwood]], made glass marbles among various other glass goods.
* [[Pelauvir's Counter]], a general store in [[Waterdeep]], sold marbles among its miscellaneous goods.

==Usages==
* Besides slipping up foes, ball bearings were sometimes used by those traversing [[dungeon]]s to test for slopes and other irregularities.
* ''[[Dead man's eyes]]'' required a pair of glass marbles, the same color as the [[spellcaster]]'s eyes, as a [[material component]].
* ''[[Shadow form]]'' required a black marble as a material component.
