Ball bearings were tiny metal balls that were used to hinder pursuers by forcing them to slow down and tread carefully or risk tripping and falling. Glass variants of these balls, known as marbles, were also used for that purpose.
A pouch of 1000 metal ball bearings could be spread over an area equivalent to a square 10 ft (3 m) on a side to provide an effective coverage. A pouch of 24 was sufficient to cover an area of 5 ft.
