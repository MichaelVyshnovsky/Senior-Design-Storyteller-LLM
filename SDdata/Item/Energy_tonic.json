        "mainbody": "Energy tonic was a special concoction, created to be consumed by sluggish warforged, exclusively, invigorating them.\nEnergy tonics were bottled in glass receptacles. The liquid was sweet-tasting and bubbly. The tonics came in normal quality, strong, and enchanted, with the enchanted variety being the most potent and expensive among the three. The strong variety had a more pungent taste and could revitalize a warforgeds mind. The enchanted variety was an oily substance.\nEnergy tonics were introduced to Toril and the village of Eveningstar in the 15 century DR, when adventurers from the world of Eberron, in including the warforged adventurers, set out to investigate the happenings in the infamous Haunted Halls."
