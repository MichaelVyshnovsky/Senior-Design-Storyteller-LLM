A '''''Lords' ring''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] given to all [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

==Powers==
A ''Lords' ring'' provided the wearer with the [[magical]] benefits of a ''[[periapt of proof against poison]]''. The ''ring'' could also be used to issue a ''[[sending]]'' to [[Khelben Arunsun]] or [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], and safely ''[[teleport]]'' the wearer to a predetermined familiar location at will.
