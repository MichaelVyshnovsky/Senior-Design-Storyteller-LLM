        "mainbody": "tone salve was a magical ointment that could either cure petrification or apply a stone-skinned protection.\nIf one ounce was rubbed over a being that had been petrified, then stone salve restored them as with a stone to flesh spell. If they were already flesh, then it turned their skin stony for a short period, protecting them as with a stoneskin spell.\nThe expensive stone salve cost 4000 gold pieces per ounce (28.3495 grams).\n* Isti-Zar\n* Jezz the Lame, one of the leaders of House Jaelre, possessed two vials of stone salve.\n* Orielden, a guard in the House of Night, kept a small jar of stone salve underneath his bunk in the temple."
