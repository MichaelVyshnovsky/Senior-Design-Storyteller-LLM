Ghost rods were a type of magical staff.
Ghost rods were ornate scepters made of glass with a blue hue.
Once per day, a ghost rod allowed its wielder to turn incorporeal, but not ethereal like a true ghost, for a maximum of one minute and thirty seconds. Under this effect a creature possessed all the associated benefits and drawbacks of being incorporeal, including the capability of hurting any other creature that was also incorporeal.
* Jaranthra Wynkle owned a ghost rod that was gifted to her by Elminster.
