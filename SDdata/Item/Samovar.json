        "mainbody": "Samovars were vessels filled with boiling water intended for serving tea.\nA samovar appeared as an urn-shaped vessel with a spigot. A tube of burning charcoal kept water stored within at boiling temperature.\nWhile typically crafted out of metals such as tin, some samovars were instead made of porcelain.\nSome of these vessels were crafted to accommodate a separate teapot on top, which would be filled with particularly strong tea meant to be diluted with the samovars boiling water. In Zakhara, samovars of this kind were sometimes also used to serve coffee.\nA marilith-shaped samovar was one of several madness-inducing magical items spread by Grazzt during his stay in the Deep Wastes."
