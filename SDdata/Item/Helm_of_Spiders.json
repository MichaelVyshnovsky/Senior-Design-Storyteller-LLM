He told the party to seek out Rizzen Do'Urden, a spy who secretly worked for House Fey-Branche. Before they left, the wizard transformed each of the party members into drow elves, to disguise them as a returning patrol.

He asked them to retrieve a rare [[Gold|golden]] necklace from the [[mantle]] caverns, a dangerous cavern filled with [[umber hulk]]s and [[night hunter]]s. Upon returning the necklace, Jarlaxle somewhat met his promise, not giving them the insignia, but telling them where it could be found.\n\nFrom Jarlaxle's directions, the party came across a patrol full of young Do'Urden nobles.

        "History": {
            "Origin": "The ''Helm of Spiders'' was created in [[Menzoberranzan]] long before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was created by a high [[priestess]] of unknown name and House. The priestess hoped to use the power of the legendary helmet to unite the [[drow]] under her House and lead assaults on both the [[Underdark]] and the surface world. The goddess Lolth, being a chaotic deity, despised such terrible ambition under the pretext of unity. Thus, she ordered the destruction of the creator, and the creator's House. The Queen of Spiders also erased the memory of those who were aware of the helm's existence.\n\nUnder orders of their goddess, the drow engaged in a raging battle with the unknown House, which was crushed. As a result, the mysterious helmet was split into its three components, and lost in time.",
            "Recovery of Pieces": "Aeons later, parts of the artifact were recovered. The base of the helmet was recovered by an innkeeper from [[Icewind Dale]]. [[Matron Baenre]], upon finding out about this discovery, instructed the innkeeper to transport it to Menzoberranzan. He, however, had different ideas, and passed the item to a group of adventurers, heading to Menzoberranzan to rescue prisoners of their village. The group believed it to be an ordinary magical helmet, a gift to them from the innkeeper, for their efforts in fighting off a drow raid.\n\nThe adventuring group then, before heading into the Underdark, sought out a wise [[gem]] [[enchanter]] called [[Vermulean]]. He informed them that a trade caravan carrying gems had mysteriously gone missing to the east. The party found four of these rare gems in a cavern of [[leucrotta]]s. The [[druid]] then enchanted the gems to allow the party to see in the [[Underdark]]. Unbeknown to the party and the druid, one of these gems was actually the Gem of Lolth.\n\nAfter they made their way to the [[myconid]] caverns, the party were able to find the crest of the Helm, in the form of a spider carved of jade.",
            "Distribution of Pieces": "When the party finally reached Menzoberranzan, still unaware of the properties of the helmet, they entered the [[Bazaar (Menzoberranzan)|bazaar]] to trade. [[Galentha]], a well-known drow merchant, offered the party a mystical healing [[music box]], and a pair of magic candles. In need of healing after their strenuous journey, the party accepted the trade.\n\nThe group of adventurers later found a merchant, called [[Ssar Tarell]], who specialized in the trade of information. Desperate to find the captive villagers, the party promised to free the soul of her beloved [[Maznafein]] from the [[drider]]'s curse, kept in the throne of Matron Baenre. Ssar Tarell sent them to [[Jalynfein]], who had further information and a scroll to allow them to both access House Baenre and to undo the drider curse.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = Matron Baenre\n| text   = If I must send agents of my own House to retrieve it, then you shall pay the cost of their efforts with your blood.\n}}\nUpon arrival at the throne of Matron Baenre, the curse was undone, and the party witnessed a meeting that took place between the innkeeper (from their village in Icewind Dale) and the matron mother. She reprimanded the innkeeper for not transporting it to her himself, and was about to execute the man. He, however, noticed the party he had given the helm to, and told Matron Baenre. The party informed the matron mother that they traded it already, and she angrily demanded for them to retrieve it, or they would be slain.",
            "Acquisition of Helm & Crest by House Do'Urden": "The party returned to Galentha, who they found struck by an assassin. The assassin then levitated to [[House Do'Urden]]. The adventurers returned to Ssar Tarell, who was joined by her love, now freed of the drider's curse. He told the party that House Do'Urden, not only had the helmet, but was also keeping the prisoners of the adventurers' village.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = Grumsnzar Fey-Branche\n| text   = The crest and the helmet may already be in Do'Urden's hands. Lolth cannot allow them to gain the gem as well—and if she will not, I will not.\n}}\nFor the final part of her information, Galentha told the companions to seek out the [[House Fey-Branche]] wizard, [[Grumsznar]], who largely opposed House Do'Urden.
