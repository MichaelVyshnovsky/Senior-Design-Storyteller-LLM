A '''fire poker''', or '''fire iron''' (commonly known simply as a '''poker''' or '''iron'''), was a common household tool used to tend to fires.

==Description==
Pokers were usually made of [[wrought iron]] shaped into a long bar or rod, with a hook or prong at the end. They were used to safely push and pull pieces of burning wood or other fuel inside a fireplace or campfire.

==Availability==
Pokers and similar fire-related tools and implements could be found at [[Ember Me More]], a dedicated shop in [[Ravens Bluff]].
