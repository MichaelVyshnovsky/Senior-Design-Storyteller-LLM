Hordelands kumiss was considered only mildly alcoholic whereas Zakharan koumiss was known to be very potent. though he struggled to even tolerate it, he eventually developed a liking for it.\n\nAmong the Tuigan, \"black\" kumiss was made from the milk of the khahan's own mares. It was considered to be the highest quality.\n\nIn the Hordelands, it was stored in leather skin bags<ref> and drunk from cups or bowls or direct from a serving ladle.",

They were offered kumiss, but a Theskan soldier named [[Kyrok]] feared it was [[poison]] and refused to drink. Yamun and his generals were angered at this disrespect of their customs and insult to the khahan, and had him beheaded immediately. In a later meeting, Azoun drank kumiss—from the skull of [[Abatai]], a former enemy of Yamun—and conducted their meeting."
