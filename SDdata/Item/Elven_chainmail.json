        "Description": "This armor was of the finest elven craftsmanship, just as resilient as it was delicate and beautifully designed. Elven chain was so finely wrought that it could be worn under regular clothing without being readily noticed. They were commonly crafted from [[mithral]] links, and could be [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] in the same manner as any other suit of armor.\n\nThe links of the armor were often inscribed with tiny [[rune]]s or [[Espruar|characters]] of the [[elven language]] that recited elven prayers, quotations and even [[magic]]al invocations.",
        "Powers": "Elven chain did not hamper the spellcasting abilities of [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s nor the stealthy movements of [[rogue]]s,"
