        "mainbody": "lven chainmail, also known as elven chain, was a type of chainmail that was created by the elves of Faer√ªn.\nThis armor was of the finest elven craftsmanship, just as resilient as it was delicate and beautifully designed. Elven chain was so finely wrought that it could be worn under regular clothing without being readily noticed. They were commonly crafted from mithral links, and could be enchanted in the same manner as any other suit of armor.\nThe links of the armor were often inscribed with tiny runes or characters of the elven language that recited elven prayers, quotations and even magical invocations.\nElven chain did not hamper the spellcasting abilities of wizards and sorcerers nor the stealthy movements of rogues,"
