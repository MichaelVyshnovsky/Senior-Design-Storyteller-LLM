A '''''thyrsus of the druid''''' was a type of magical [[druid]]ic [[staff]].

==Description==
A ''thyrsus of the druid'' typically had a very gnarled look to it. They were most commonly carved from single pieces of [[oak]], [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]], or [[weirwood]]. Leafy vines that maintained an eternally vibrant look wrapped around the shafts and upon their tops was mounted a pinecone.

==Powers==
A ''thyrsus of the druid'' typically allowed its wielder to cast the following set of spells:
:''[[Animate plants]]'' • ''[[control plants]]'' • ''[[plant growth]]'' • ''[[speak with plants]]'' • ''[[thorn spray]]''

==History==
The original ''thyrsus of the druid'' was created by [[Craenoth Driel]], a [[wood elf]] druid who hailed from [[Eaerlann]]. He ultimately died while defending the [[High Forest]] from the [[tanarukk]] forces of [[Hellgate Keep]], who then plundered his creation.

Driel's [[acolyte]]s, who greatly mourned the loss of their master and his creation, went on to create a multitude of derivative staves to honor his memory.
