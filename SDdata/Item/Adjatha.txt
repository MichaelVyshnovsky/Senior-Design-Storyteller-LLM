Adjatha the Drinker was a magical longsword with a powerful life-stealing enchantment.
This +2 longsword healed the wielder every time it struck an opponent. In addition, it granted them immunity to any charm and dominating spells and effects.
This blade was once owned by a servant of the deity Bhaal, Dabber, who led a cadre of minions. Whenever he returned from battle with even the slightest of injury, Dabber considered it a failure of his subordinate officers. He punished them with regular assaults while wielding Adjatha until he was fully recovered from his wounds.
At some point, the sword came into the possession of the cambion known as the Warden of the Planar Prison that appeared in Athkatla in the year 1369 DR.
