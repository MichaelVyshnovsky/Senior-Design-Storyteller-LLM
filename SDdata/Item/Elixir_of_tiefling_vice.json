        "mainbody": "'''''Elixirs of tiefling vice''''' were [[potion]]s created through sanguineous magic arts by [[Araj Oblodra]] of [[Crimson Draughts]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Elixirs of tiefling vice'' were distilled from the blood of [[tiefling]]s, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with ''fiendish vice'', allowing them to call on the diabolic arcana of the blood to cast ''[[thaumaturgy]]'', ''[[hellish rebuke]]'', ''[[burning hands]]'', and ''[[flame blade]]''. The blood magic of the potion was expended after one day.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Araj Oblodra, an [[alchemist]] and a blood vendor, was using the blood of [[tiefling]]s infected with the [[illithid]] tadpoles of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in [[Moonrise Towers]]. After the death of [[Ketheric Thorm]], she returned to the Crimson Draughts, her apothecary in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], where she resumed her sanguineous magic experiments."
