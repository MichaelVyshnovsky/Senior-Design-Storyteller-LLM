A '''''ring of the ram''''', also referred to as a '''''breaker of castles''''', was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[ring]] that released a blast of pure [[force]] energy that resembled a spectral ram's head.

==Effects==
Upon pointing their hand in a certain direction and uttering the [[command word]], the wearer released a destructive eruption of energy that was capable of destroying walls, castle gates, or the bones of the wearer's foes.

These rings possessed three charges and recharged every morning at dawn. Additional charges could be used upon the ring's use, increasing the strength and potency of the blast.

The effects of these rings were recreated by the [[arcane]] [[spell]], ''[[Battering ram (spell)|battering ram]]''.

==Notable Ring of the Ram==
*The ''ring of the ram'' that belonged to [[Nathaniel]] of [[Kuldahar]] ''circa'' [[1312 DR]] allowed the wearer to use all regular powers of the item and cast ''[[knock]]'', ''[[bull's strength]]'', and ''[[alicorn lance]]''.

==History==
[[Pal Verbosh]], one of the deadliest pirates of the [[Nelanther Isles]], had his ship - ''[[Tight-lipped Sailor]]'', sunk by a rival pirate who was wearing a ''ring of the ram''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Nathaniel of Kuldahar was imprisoned within a massive glacial palace of ice erected by the cultists of [[Auril]] allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in the [[Frozenfar]]. With help of Targos's mercenaries, Nathaniel was able to reclaim his unique version of the ''ring of the ram'' and use its magics to collapse a wall of ice that cut Kuldahar off from the rest of [[Icewind Dale]].
