The '''''dancing hart''''' was a magical chalice that was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.

==Description==
It was carved in the shape of a [[deer]] that held a cup in its antlers.

==Powers==
Certain old records of arcane matters stated that the cup component should be filled with the blood of one's foe in order to activate the power of the ''dancing hart''. However, its actual powers were lost to history.

==History==
As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''dancing hart''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost. It was speculated to lie among the treasures of [[Toranu Gang-po]], a fortress whose location was also lost by the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].
