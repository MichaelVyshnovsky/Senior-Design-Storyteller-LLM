'''''Sivlem''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[longsword]] crafted by master smith [[Nevik]] of [[Amn]].

==Powers==
''Sivlem'' was initially created to be an intelligent blade that would inspire heroism and valor in its owner. However, Nevik, by accident, imbued sentience into ''Sivlem's'' less impressive twin. Despite being silent, the sword possessed an immensely powerful ''+6'' enchantment that dealt devastating damage to its foes and made aiming attacks effortless. ''Sivlem'' also enhanced the wielder's physical strength and granted them the ability similar to the effects of the ''[[freedom of movement]]'' [[spell]]. The blade possessed a razor-sharp ''[[keen]]'' edge and edited a gentle blue glow, illuminating {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}} around it.

==History==
The weapon was forged some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] by master smith Nevik who intended ''Sivlem'' to serve as the pinnacle of his craft â€“ the best sword in Amn. He succeeded in creating a beautiful weapon filled with magic, humming with power. However, when Nevik drew the sword for the first time and ordered it to speak, he realized that he had made a mistake in his enchantments and imbued ''Sivlem's'' sibling weapon with intelligence instead. Despite the error, ''Sivlem'' still had a long history of wielders through the years, but not as many as its lucky sister sword.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the weapon fell into he hands of [[Mother Feodorra]], a charm and magic item peddler from the [[Rashemi]] city of [[Mulsantir]].
