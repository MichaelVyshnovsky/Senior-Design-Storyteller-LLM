        "mainbody": "rooches of number numbing were enchanted clasps that could cloud the mind of its target with confusion that affected their ability to perceive and use numbers.\nBrooches of number numbing were usually pieces of jewelry made out of silver or gold, sometimes entrusted with gems. Functionally, these brooches were used as clasps that fastened the owners cloak or cape.\nMagic powers imbued into a piece of jewelry could only be activated if worn in plain sight of the intended target. The enchantments affected a target passively, clouding the minds of individuals with whom the owner conversed. Affected targets forgot the relative value of numbers, making it impossible for them to work with money, haggle, or perform any number-related tasks. What made these clasps even more useful was the fact that individuals affected with mind-numbing did not recognize the inability to handle numbers nor remembered their values. Affected thought that all numbers were the same and agreed to any number-related claim or deal. However, concepts related to money, such as gold being more expensive than silver, remained unaffected, yet the spell obfuscated the knowledge of conversion rates.\nThe number numbing effect lasted as long as a brooch remained visible and from twelve to seventy-two seconds after. When the victims minds cleared, they still remembered the conversations and deeds done while under the effects of magic. However, they did not automatically know what or who caused the confusion.\n*Gromph Baenre, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, one of the most powerful wizards of Menzoberranzan in the 14 century DR."
