'''''G'varok's anvil''''' was once a profitable and secretly [[enchanted]] [[anvil]] that belonged to a renowned [[dwarf|dwarvish]] smith named [[G'varok]] of [[Mirabar]] some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
As the {{Yearlink|1374}}, ''G'varok's anvil'' was a large anvil, cracked in two, with its surface looking blackened and brittle.

==Powers==
When it was used by G'varok, the anvil was enchanted to dramatically improve the dwarf's blacksmithing work.

==History==
G'varok of Mirabar became renowned for his great work forging [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] of the highest quality, years before 1374 DR. Unbeknownst to everyone but the dwarf, he commissioned the [[Item enchantment|enchanting]] of his anvil by a master [[wizard]], ensuring that every piece crated on it was a marvelous masterpiece. With time, G'varok fame spread across the [[Sword Coast]] and the dwarf pridefully declared himself the greatest smith alive. The fame eventually was G'varok's downfall. A powerful [[frost giant]] and a master smith named [[Marruti]] from all the way in the frigid tundra of [[Icewind Dale]] headed off the dwarf's claims. The giant traveled to Mirabar and challenged G'varok to a smithing contest. Historical accounts did not preserve the competition's details but its outcome was well known. Marruti was the first to take a [[hammer]] to ''G'varok's anvil'' and with a single strike cracked it in the middle. With the anvil becoming unusable, G'varok lost the competition, unable to magically boost his smithing skills. The dwarf left Mirabar in disgrace and ''G'varok's anvil'', reportedly, was taken by Marruti as a trophy.

By 1374 DR, ''G'varok's anvil'' had found its way into the hands of planeswalking [[wizard]] and curio dealer [[Mintassan the Magnificent]] and was proudly displayed among many other unique and strange items in his shop, [[Mintassan's Mysteries]].
