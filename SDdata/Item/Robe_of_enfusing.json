        "Powers": "''Robes of enfusing's'' enchantments were weaved to enhance the wearer's spell power and defense. The magical defenses of these robes were similar to that of a ''+2'' enchantment. Additionally, the ''robes of enfusing'' gave the wearer minor magic resistance, a minor boost to the knowledge of legends and lore, and allowed memorization of an additional spell per day, such as ''[[magic missile]]'' or similar power level.",
        "History": "Dating to the days of Netheril, wizards favored these robes for their ease of production, sturdiness, light weight, and the ability to hold complicated enchantments fairly easy.\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], ''robes of enfusing'' were used by the spell-casters of the [[Kraken Society]] who allied themselves with the [[devil]] [[Belhifet]], residing within [[Dorn's Deep]]. Another robe could be found among treasures within the [[Dragon's Eye]] caverns on the [[Spine of the World]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Orrick|Orrick the Gray]]: a [[wizard]] who lived on the edge of [[Kuldahar]] and dedicated his life to the study of ''[[mythal]]s''."
