        "mainbody": "Vellum was a high-quality writing surface material made from calfskin.\nVellum was similar in form and function to other kinds of writing surfaces such as paper, parchment, and papyrus, though rarer and more expensive. It was made of animal hide, like parchment, but was made exclusively from the scraped and tanned hide of calves, producing a superior material.\nAuroras Emporium sold vellum sheets for 1 gp each, alongside various other writing surfaces and tools.\nIn Waterdeep, the League of Skinners and Tanners handled all aspects of tanning and leatherworking, including the production of vellum.\nCalaunt was a great producer and exporter of leatherwork including vellum.\nValuable projects such as building plans, academic treatises, and wizards tomes were often created upon vellum.\nVellum was an ideal material for creating spell scrolls, producing more reliable results than papyrus and parchment.\nDetect poison used a strip of blessed vellum, turning black in the presence of poison."
