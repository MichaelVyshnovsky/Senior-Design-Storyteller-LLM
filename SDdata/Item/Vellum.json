        "Description": "Vellum was similar in form and function to other kinds of writing surfaces such as [[paper]], [[parchment]], and [[papyrus]], though rarer and more expensive. It was made of animal hide, like parchment, but was made exclusively from the scraped and tanned hide of calves, producing a superior material.",
        "Availability": "[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold vellum sheets for 1 [[gp]] each, alongside various other writing surfaces and tools.\n\nIn [[Waterdeep]], the [[League of Skinners and Tanners]] handled all aspects of tanning and leatherworking, including the production of vellum.\n\n[[Calaunt]] was a great producer and exporter of leatherwork including vellum.",
        "Usage": "Valuable projects such as building plans, academic treatises, and [[wizard]]'s tomes were often created upon vellum.\n\nVellum was an ideal material for creating [[spell scroll]]s, producing more reliable results than [[papyrus]] and [[parchment]].\n\n''[[Detect poison]]'' used a strip of blessed vellum, turning black in the presence of [[poison]]."
