        "mainbody": "Henrys carpetbag of holding was a unique aged and rugged bag of holding that belonged to illusionist Henry the Shadow Master of Nellie Thursday Home for Experienced Adventurers in the mid-14 century DR.\nDespite its worn appearance, the carpetbag of holding was spacious enough to fit almost all of Henry the Shadow Masters belongings for many years. The bag contained not one but four extra-dimensional spaces, 200 cubic feet of volume each. Even though the four spaces purpose was organization, Henrys carpetbag was filled with long-forgotten treasures and other random items accumulated throughout the wizards long life. The Shadow Master was known to pull surprising new items from the bag instead of those he searched for."
