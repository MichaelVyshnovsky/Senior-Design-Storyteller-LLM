        "Powers": "Despite its worn appearance, the ''carpetbag of holding'' was spacious enough to fit almost all of Henry the Shadow Master's belongings for many years. The bag contained not one but four extra-dimensional spaces, 200 cubic feet of volume each. Even though the four spaces' purpose was organization, ''Henry's carpetbag'' was filled with long-forgotten treasures and other random items accumulated throughout the wizard's long life. The Shadow Master was known to pull surprising new items from the bag instead of those he searched for."
