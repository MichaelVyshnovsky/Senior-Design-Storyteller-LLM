Gloves of thievery or burglars gloves, were a pair of gloves that greatly increased the wearers skill at picking locks and pickpocketing others.
These gloves only took appearance when they were not worn. When equipped, they were completely invisible.
Gloves of thievery, when worn, granted the wearer advanced sleight of hand. With greater nimbleness of their fingers, the wearer could perform tricks, steal or plant items on others, and conceal objects much better than they usually could.
In 1357 DR, a pair of gloves of thievery were located in the Pit of Moander, to the north of YÃ»lash.
