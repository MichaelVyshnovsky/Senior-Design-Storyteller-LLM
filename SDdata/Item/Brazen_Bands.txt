'''''Brazen Bands''''' were [[enchanted]] defensive [[bracers]] that increased the wielder's mundane defense, as opposed to giving them magical protection.

==Powers==
These bands possessed magics that attracted the enemy's attacks and canceled their inertia, offering mundane protection as effective as a full set of heavy [[chainmail]]. But unlike actual chainmails, the wearer was unrestricted or encountered by the armor.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, a set of ''Brazen Bands'' belonged to [[Bashshar al Rachid]], a famous collector, merchant, and the wealthiest [[djinni]] on [[Toril]], who found himself trapped in a ''[[genie prison]]''.
