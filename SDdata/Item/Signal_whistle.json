They were used by humans and other races, such as hobgoblins.\nSignal whistles were used in some places throughout Toril, particularly in Faer√ªn, Zakhara,\n* The guards of Jasuga would summon reinforcements via the use of the signal whistles they would keep on them, especially when the city walls were being scaled.\n* The adventurer Balismo Dey Canna always kept a signal whistle on his person.\n* The City Watch of Waterdeep as well as the guards of the Shoon Palace were known to use whistles to call reinforcement in case of trouble.\n* The traffic wardens of Waterdeep used whistles and small colored flags to order drovers around.\n*The Maces of Elversult used specific whistle codes that allowed them to communicate details about the nature of threats they faced.\n* Cormyrean guardsmen were known to use dragon-headed whistles."
