'''Angelar's skin''', also seen as '''aasimon's skin''' and '''angel's skin''', was not a mineral but a [[coral]] found on reefs in shallow tropical waters.

==Description==
Proper preparation of these delicate pink [[fancy stones]] included baking in the sun for many days to dry them out and to eliminate the odor of dead sea life. It could then be worked into jewelry but had to be protectively mounted to avoid accidental breakage. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 [[gp]], possibly up to 200 gp in some areas.

==Rumors & Legends==
This gem got its name from the [[sorcerer]] [[Angelar]], who (according to legend) became a [[wereshark]] with complete control over his transformations. The story tells that he consumed this coral in powdered form mixed into sea water and then cast ''[[polymorph self]]'' to become a shark. Another colleague then cast two more spells on him: ''[[water breathing]]'', and Angelar's own invention, an [[arcane magic|arcane]] version of the [[divine magic|divine]] ''[[free action]]'' spell. The legend goes on to say he achieved a long life, and that other wizards or even non-wizards could do as he did, if they could find trustworthy spellcasters to perform the regimen.
