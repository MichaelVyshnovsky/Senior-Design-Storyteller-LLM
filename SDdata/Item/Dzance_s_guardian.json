        "mainbody": "Dzances guardian was a magical shield of unknown origin, though it was believed to be dwarven in craft.\nThe shield enveloped its bearer in an aura that deflected magic missiles and absorbed magical electricity, such as that from shocking grasp. The latter effect would remain in the shield and, if its wielder so desired, could be discharged at nearby foes. When this occurred, there was about a one-in-three chance the shield and its wielder would be shifted into a random plane of existence.\nThe shield was discovered in the depths of Gauntlgrym by the ranger Dzance. Upon his retirement in Silverymoon, he bestowed it to a young knight named Belpir. Upon leaving for adventure, Belpir, and the shield, have not been seen since."
