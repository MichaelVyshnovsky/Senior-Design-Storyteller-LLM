'''Beef and Oysters Barnabus''' was a dish known in [[Faerûn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Combined with wild [[rice]],

==History==
In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, in [[Ghars]] in [[Cormyr]], [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]] planned to have Beef and Oysters Barnabas for the welcoming dinner at the [[Sheaf of Wheat]] inn for the upcoming Grand Council of the [[Merchants' Guild]]. He ordered a butt of [[Westgate Ruby]] from [[Shortshanks]] of the [[Bold Bard]] tavern, swearing it was the ''only'' wine to have with Beef and Oysters Barnabas.

At the dinner on [[Eleint 19]], it was the most popular dish on offer, with the councilmen queuing up and coming back for more, though this was mostly due to the beautiful [[Mayella Meadowbrock]] doing the serving. Even [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] had seconds, despite hating oysters.
