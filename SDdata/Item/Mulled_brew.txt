'''Mulled brew''' was an alcoholic beverage made from beer or [[ale]] and served hot. It was popular in many inns and taverns across [[Faerûn]], especially in areas with colder climates.{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}}

==Recipe==
There were many variations of this drink, but a typical recipe started with a strong-flavored beer or ale. [[Moon Mountain Dark]] was a favored base for [[humans]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].
* a small keg of beer or ale
* a handful of sugar
* two pinches of [[nutmeg]] powder
* some [[wikipedia:en:clove|cloves]]
* some [[blackroot]]
* a handful of [[ginger root]] powder
* a slice of [[apple]] or [[lime]]
* a splash of rum
All ingredients except the rum were heated in a pot to the verge of boiling. When the brew was ready, the rum was added and pot was removed from the heat, stirred, and allowed to cool for a short time (one or two verses of a drinking song was about right).
