Mulled brew was an alcoholic beverage made from beer or ale and served hot. It was popular in many inns and taverns across Faer√ªn, especially in areas with colder climates.
There were many variations of this drink, but a typical recipe started with a strong-flavored beer or ale. Moon Mountain Dark was a favored base for humans in the Savage Frontier, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
* a small keg of beer or ale
* a handful of sugar
* two pinches of nutmeg powder
* some cloves
* some blackroot
* a handful of ginger root powder
* a slice of apple or lime
* a splash of rum
All ingredients except the rum were heated in a pot to the verge of boiling. When the brew was ready, the rum was added and pot was removed from the heat, stirred, and allowed to cool for a short time (one or two verses of a drinking song was about right).
