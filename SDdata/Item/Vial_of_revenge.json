        "mainbody": "Vial of revenge was a potion invented by the rashemi wizard Shevarith Kendia in the late 15 century DR.\nThe potion was ingested prior to battle. If the imbiber were ever slain, it would trigger an arcane curse that inflicted the imbibers full magical strength against all of their enemies at once.\nShevarith had travelled to Waterdeep to earn the respect of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr, and was driven to pursue magical excellence at all costs. She devised the vial of revenge to make sure that no one would ever best her in combat without paying a price.\n* Shevarith Kendia, a rashemi wizard who worked as an adventurer on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, during the late 15 century DR."
