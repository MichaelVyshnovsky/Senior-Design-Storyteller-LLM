'''''Ritual battleaxes of blessing''''' were [[dwarf|dwarven]] enchanted ceremonial [[axe]]s used for burial by the dwarfs of [[Myth Drannor]]'s [[Dwarven Dungeons]].

==Description==
''Ritual battleaxes of blessing'' often appeared unused and lacking any signs of being used in battle. The axe itself had a harp double blade, perfectly capable of being wielded in combat.

==Powers==
These [[battleaxe]]s had a +1 enchantment as well as gave the user the ability to cast ''[[bless]]''.

==History==
In the days preceding the [[Weeping War]], ''ritual battleaxes of blessing'' were laid along with dwarven warriors in the  burial coffins as a part of the final rites ceremony. By [[1369 DR]], some of these enchanted battleaxes could be found in the coffins left behind in the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of Myth Drannor, left behind by the restless [[undead]] the fallen heroes became.
