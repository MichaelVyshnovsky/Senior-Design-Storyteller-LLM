        "mainbody": "Mondassos automated spell scrolls were enchanted scrolls created by the traveling mage named Mondasso sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nMondassos automated spell scrolls appeared as mundane scrolls made of vellum. These scrolls were blank, apart from a simple letter \"M\" at the top of the scroll.\nMondassos automated spell scrolls were among items invented by Mondasso, who spent several decades traveling Abeir and Toril. He specialized in magical gizmos that aided and sped up the creation of mages scrolls. In order to use these scrolls, their owner had to rest for several hours â€“ equal time needed to memorize arcane spells. When the spellcaster awoke, they opened up Mondassos automated spell scroll and spread 10 gp worth of ink on its surface, after which the magic scroll began to absorb and shape the ink, memorizing the spells directly from the mages mind. Each Mondassos scroll could hold up to twenty unique spells."
