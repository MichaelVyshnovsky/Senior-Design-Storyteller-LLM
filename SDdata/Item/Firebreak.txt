'''''Firebreak''''' was a suit of magical [[plate armor]] found in [[Thorngap]], a [[druid]]ic circle in [[Cormyr]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The armor was a light set of plate, using a combination of rigid and flexible segments.

==Powers==
The plate was enchanted to heavily resist heat and fire, and even produced its own blue [[fire shield]] of cold flames. It also broadly protected the wearer beyond normal capabilities, and slowly [[regenerate]]d wounds.

==History==
''Firebreak'' was found in the possession of a group of [[drow]] males that escaped the [[Underdark]], only to emerge inside the [[Druid's Deep]] inside Thorngap. Their attempt to conquer and [[enslave]] the surface world was short-lived.
