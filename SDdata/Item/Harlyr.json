        "mainbody": "'''Harlyr''' ({{Pronounce|har|LEER|refs=}}) was the cheapest and the most common [[perfume]] found on the streets of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Harlyr was a clear, slightly [[oil]]y red liquid that had no smell unless applied to bare skin. On most [[humanoids]]'s skin, harlyr was absorbed and exuded a pleasant aroma of freshly bloomed [[rose]]s for about three hours. When it was applied to the skin of [[half-orc]]s, [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[hobgoblin]]s, harlyr turned black and released stench of charred [[goldflow]].",
        "Preparation": "The recipe for harlyr was commonly and correctly known as using [[nut]] oil, [[alcohol]], and the sap of three types of common [[wildflower]]s."
