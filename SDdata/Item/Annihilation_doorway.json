        "mainbody": "An '''''annihilation doorway''''' was a type of ''[[dread doorway]]'' whose entrance would utterly destroy any creature that passed through it. The only way to reverse its effect was through [[divine]] intervention.",
        "Appearance": "''Annihilation doorways'' weren't actual doors, but more the frame of a passageway, often carved in horrifying decor. For example, one could be shaped in the head of a [[demon]] with the opening going into it's mouth. This opening acted as a vertical, planar ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'', appearing as a pure black void."
