        "mainbody": "'''''Orbakh's ivory scepter''''' was a powerful enchanted [[wand|rod]] that belonged to [[Orbakh (Myth Drannor)|Orbakh]] one of the [[necromancer]]s from ancient [[Myth Drannor]]. This sceptred possessed magics powerful enough to destroy a [[lich]] or [[dracolich]] ''[[phylactery]]''.",
        "Description": "''Orbakh's ivory scepter'' was a short and stout [[staff]] carved out of [[elephant]] [[ivory]]. The wand was topped with a small ivory skull.",
        "Powers": "This scepter was a magical item imbued with inherently evil magic which drained strength of any goodly creature who attempted to wield it. This effect, however, was not permanent and was instantaneously reversed once a goodly creature let ''Orbakh's ivory scepter'' go.\n\nThe ''scepter'' stored several powerful spells allowing its wielder to discharge them at will. Each used spell exhausted one or several charges. These spells were: ''[[detect undead]]'' which costed 1 charge, ''[[disrupt undead]]'' - 1 charge, ''[[shatter]]'' - 2 charges, ''[[halt undead]]'' - 2 charges, and ''[[vampiric touch]]'' 2 charges up. When the wand was recovered from its original owner's tomb it did not possess its full power and only held 41 charges.",
        "History": "Long before [[Myth Drannor]] was destroyed in the [[Weeping War]], this ''ivory scepter'' was wielded by Orbakh of the [[Tower of Bones]] that stood on [[Polyandrium]] of the City of Song. When the necromancer reached old age he unsuccessfully attempted to reach lichdom and perished in the process. He was interred inside the [[Crypt of Orbakh]] and his scepter was laid to rest with its master.\n\n''Orbakh's ivory scepter'' resurfaced in [[1369 DR]]. A group of heroes set against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that occupied the ruined city that year attempting to sow destruction via corruption of a ''[[pool of radiance]].'' The adventurers were guided by a [[baelnorn]], [[Molostroi]], to recover the ''ivory scepter'' in order to destroy Cult's dracolich [[Pelendralaar]] and his ''phylactery''. This act eventually aided in Pelendralaar's destruction at the hands of the [[Veiled Ones]]."
