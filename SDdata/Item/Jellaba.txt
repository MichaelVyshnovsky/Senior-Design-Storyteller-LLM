A '''jellaba''', ({{Pronounce|jell|AH|bah|refs=}}) or "night cloak",

==Description==
This heavy garment was made from [[felt]] or wool and was less decorated than the standard aba. They were made of a dark (usually black) material, often heavy [[camel]] [[wool]]. They hung down to the ground and were generally sleeveless, though some had full, open sleeves. Like an aba, they were typically closed at the waist by means of a [[sash]].
