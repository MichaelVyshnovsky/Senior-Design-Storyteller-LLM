        "History": "New Harvest Punch was one of the highlights of the annual New Harvest Festival, alongside its famous [[Harvest Stew]]. The grand [[gnome|gnomish]] feast was turned into a disaster in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. Purfbin Doogrick and his [[Shred-o-Matic 1000]] wrecked chaos on the gnomish festival attendees. Bald [[Dame Edza]], whose prized wig was destroyed in the calamity, dived headfirst into a sizable bowl of New Harvest Punch to avoid the rampaging machinery."
