'''''Sa'Sani's signet''''' was an [[enchanted]] signet [[ring]] of Sa'Sani's [[Mercantile House]] of [[Samarach]].

==Description==
The signet was a simple but elegantly crafter ring, decorated with the crest of the Mercantile House.

==Powers==
''Sa'Sani's signet'' possessed an enchantment similar to that of a regular ''[[ring of protection]]'', with one difference: the ring gave the wearer magical protection as well as imbued the wearer with increased vitality.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a secretly [[yuan-ti]] merchant Sa'Sani presented her signet ring to a band of hirings who aided her in the development of the Mercantile House and investigation into strange sabotage of the business. The signet represented the adventurers' employment with the merchant house, giving them limited protection from the extremely xenophobic Elite Guard and the law of Samarach.
