        "mainbody": "An ersatz eye was a type of enchanted eye prosthesis.\nWhen embedded within ones eye socket, they could see through this orb as though it were a real eye. In addition, only the one wearing an ersatz eye could remove it from their eye socket.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the archeologist Marville DuCoot discovered the burial site of an ancient orc tribe in a cave system south of Bryn Shander. Within that burial site, he found an orcish-style ersatz eye, which uniquely gave its wearer the additional ability of being able to read and understand Orcish.\n* Volothamp Geddarm owned an ersatz eye in the late 15 century DR that had brass fittings."
