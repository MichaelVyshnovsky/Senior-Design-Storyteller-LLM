Aventurine, also known as a love stone,The original article in Dragon #72 states that the nickname "love stone" is unknown in the Realms, but every publication since then has given aventurine this nickname. was usually discovered in large deposits&mdashblocks up to 20 lb (9.1 kg) were not unusual.
This semi-precious stone was a variety of quartz that glittered when viewed from certain angles due to mica inclusions. It could be found in shades of green from medium to light, blues from dark to pale, or a warm gold. Faceting only detracted from the flash below the surface of this translucent stone, so it was tumbled smooth, cut cabochon, or used as an inlay or in carvings. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.
Crushed to a powder and sprinkled, thrown or blown, aventurine could dispel on contact most illusions and transformations, such as those used for disguise.
* Rashemi witches were said to seek out aventurine stones to cast invocations, evocations and perform spirit work.
