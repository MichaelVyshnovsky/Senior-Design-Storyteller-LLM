A '''''harmonic dueler''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[rapier]] designed to be wielded by charismatic individuals prone for flourishes and showmanship in battle.

==Powers==
''Harmonic dueller'' possessed a minor ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and boosted its damage. This blade vibrated and thrummed pleasantly once unsheathed. It shivered in a way reminiscent of an actor, nervous before hitting the stage. This enchantment was known as ''mellow harmony'' – it allowed a charismatic wielder to increase the blade efficiently.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''harmonic dueler'' could be found in [[Danthelon's Dancing Axe]]'s inventory, among mostly mundane items in stock.
