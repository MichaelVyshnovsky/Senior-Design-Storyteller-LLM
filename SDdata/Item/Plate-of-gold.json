        "mainbody": "'''Plate-of-gold''' was a common fried dish from the nation of [[Amn]] in [[West Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "A plate-of-gold consisted of multiple pieces of sliced vegetables, covered in [[salt]]y, occasionally [[fish]]-flavored, [[gold]]en-colored batter and deep fried. The golden fried vegetables were then doused in a golden-colored sauce made with [[honey]] and sometimes with added [[lemon]] flavor.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], travelers from outside of Amn were advised to learn the name of the dish to avoid any confusion. One of the places that served plates-of-gold was [[The Battlescarred Bard]] inn on the [[Trade Way]] in Amn."
