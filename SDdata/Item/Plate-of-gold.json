        "mainbody": "Plate-of-gold was a common fried dish from the nation of Amn in West Faer√ªn.\nA plate-of-gold consisted of multiple pieces of sliced vegetables, covered in salty, occasionally fish-flavored, golden-colored batter and deep fried. The golden fried vegetables were then doused in a golden-colored sauce made with honey and sometimes with added lemon flavor.\nBy the late 14 century DR, travelers from outside of Amn were advised to learn the name of the dish to avoid any confusion. One of the places that served plates-of-gold was The Battlescarred Bard inn on the Trade Way in Amn."
