        "mainbody": "'''Flaming Gullet''' was a spicy mixed alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], such as [[the Hidden Lady]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-18 - Delayed blast}}",
        "Description": "Flaming Gullet drink was an amber-hued mixed drink. Its ingredients were carefully measured and consisted of [[klaraunth]] (a strong and clear distilled [[barley]] alcoholic beverage from [[Tethyr]], [[Chessenta]], or the [[Vilhon Reach|Vilhon]]), a distillate of hot red [[radish]]es, a distillate of [[horseradish]], and finely crushed and powdered [[chestnut]]s.\n\nThe drink was never to be served flaming, oftentimes contradicting tall-tales and boasts heard in taverns across Faerûn.",
        "Effects": "The name of the drink was a description of what the imbiber was to expect from consuming a flaming gullet. The fiery hot drink caused th sensation of searing fire in the drinker's throat and cleared any and all congestion the drinker could have been suffering from."
