Thieves tools encompassed a wide array of equipment that aided a prospective rogue during their illicit activities. Many of these items were hand-crafted by the individual who intended to use them, but some were available through local guilds or even from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
A typical set of thieves tools included a small file, a set of lockpicks, a small mirror, scissors, and pliers, which were meant to assist in picking locks and disarming traps.
Possession of some thieves tools was enough evidence for local authorities to invite the rogue for a stay in the dungeon.
