        "Powers": "''Blackguard's sword'' possessed a potent ''+2'' enchantment that made its blade more deadly, guiding the wielder's hand towards the target, and allowing them to damage creatures that were otherwise unaffected by mundane weapons. The sword also dealt additional [[Necrotic energy|necrotic]] damage with every slash. When wielded by a [[paladin]] or a blackguard, the sword empowered their divine ''smite'' abilities, rendering the targets dazed after each successful ''smite'' attack.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''blackguard's greaves'' were worn by the guardian death knight called [[That Which Guards]], who, along with [[That Which Lurks (death knight)|That Which Lurks]] and [[That Which Watches]], guarded the entrance to the chamber of the [[Bhaalist]] [[Murder Tribunal]] in the [[Undercellar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
