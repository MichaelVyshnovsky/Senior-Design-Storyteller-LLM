        "mainbody": "lades Injurious was the name given to a unique gem-studded bracer of flying daggers owned by Jarlaxle Baenre in the late 15 century DR.\nThe ornate design and many gems of the Blades Injurious meant it matched Jarlaxles more exquisite and resplendent outfits. In truth, each gem and ornament worked into the bracer was a reminder of a secret, a promise, or a debt that kept the High Captains of Luskan under Jarlaxles thumb."
