'''''Roderick's walking stick''''' was an enchanted walking stick that could serve as a [[quarterstaff]].This item was likely related to [[Roderick Tem]], the leader of the [[Fire Knives]] prior to the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Description==
''Roderick's walking stick'' was a sturdy but otherwise ordinary-looking quarterstaff with a sharp iron point.

==Powers==
The seemingly harmless walking stick had the ability to shoot missiles coated in ''[[poison]]''. The staff could be loaded with a maximum of fifteen deadly darts.

==History==
''Roderick's walking stick'' could be found in the abandoned treasure cache that once belonged to the heroic [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] in the [[Nightingale Court]] district of [[Myth Drannor]]. The cache was hidden inside an old tomb of noble heroes. Along with the deadly ''walking stick'', the cache held a masterfully crafted [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[shield]] with a ''+3'' enchantment, and a dwarven gilded magical ''+3'' spiked [[mace]]. In [[1369 DR]], the tomb had deadly guardians nesting inside; horrific [[arraccat]]s made the Knights' cache their lair.
