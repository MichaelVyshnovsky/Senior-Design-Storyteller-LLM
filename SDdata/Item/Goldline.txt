'''Goldline''', also called '''[[wikipedia:en:cacoxenite|cacoxenite]]''', was the name given to varieties of [[wikipedia:en:quartz|quartz]] with lines of gold-colored [[wikipedia:en:goethite|goethite]] (an impurity similar to iron oxide) embedded in the matrix.

==Description==
These quartz [[ornamental stones]] could be [[amethyst]], [[citrine]], or [[smoky quartz]] with bright yellow strands or tufts of goethite running through it in parallel lines. They were typically tumbled or cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]]. Specimens could be two to three inches (five to eight centimeters) in diameter. Sometimes large pieces were found, but these were often subject to breakage during transportation.

==Powers==
Goldline had a use in enchanting metal-bladed weapons. It was held in an open flame while the appropriate spells were cast, consuming the stone and giving a plain knife, sword, or dagger a small bonus. Fortunately, greenstones were relatively common and easy to obtain.
