The '''''Shattered Flail''''' was a magic [[club]], that at some point was a fully-functional [[flail]] that belonged to a [[flind]] member of the [[cult of the Absolute]].

==Description==
The ''Shattered Flail'' was a crude club-shaped bundle of bones, fixed together by tight leather things. The club itself was merely a handle of a flind's broken flail.

==Powers==
The ''Shattered Flail'' bore foul magic of [[Yeenoghu]], the [[demon lord]] worshiped by [[gnoll]]s. The dark magic was so potent, it was almost palpable, granting the makeshift club a ''+2'' enchantment. The same demonic taint also healed a small portion of the wielder's health if the weapon successfully hit its target. Unfortunately, the ''Shattered Flail'' also infected its wielder with bloodlust, forcing them to use the ''Flail'' to attack their opponent. If the wielder chose not to deal damage with it, there was a chance that the bloodlust turned into madness.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Shattered Flail'' was in possession of a blood-hungry flind gnoll ravager in service of the cult of the Absolute. She led a squad of gnolls and [[hyena]]s on attacks against caravans traveling along the trade way from [[Elturel]] to [[Baldur's Gate]], across the [[Western Heartlands]]. One such caravan was transporting a group of [[Zhentarim]] smugglers to their secret base under [[Waukeen's Rest]]. With the caravan raided, the Zhenths escaped and fended for their life against the blind and rabid followers of the ''Shattered Flail'''s owner.
