'''''Traveler's Yarn''''' was a type of magical spirits available in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The [[enchanted]] beverage was on the menu at the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern of Waterdeep, with its bottles stashed away in [[Durnan]]'s cabinet. One serving of ''Traveler's Yarn'' was priced at ten [[gold]] [[coin]]s.
