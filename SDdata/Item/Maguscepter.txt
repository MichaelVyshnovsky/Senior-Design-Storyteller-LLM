The Maguscepter was an artifact crafted by Myntharan, courtier of the Shoon Imperium during the 5 century DR.
The Maguscepter was a heavy mace with a shaft carved from shadow-wood that had been engraved with  necromantic runes formed by deep red silkstone and tiger eye agate. The head of the scepter was comprised of the skull of King Thorndaer, which been covered with gold plating.
This +3 heavy mace was imbued with a number of powerful magical powers. It inflicted negative energy when it struck a foe and stored their life force within its own reservoirs of power. When the wielder of the Maguscepter cast arcane spells, they did not lose the magic they had memorized, but rather tapped into the life force stored that had been absorbed by the artifact in the previous 24 hours.
The scepter was crafted by Myntharan before the Year of Rolling Heads, 452 DR, when the imperial court wizard seized the throne of Westgate. The specific design and process of its creation were Netherese in origin.
The last known mortal to wield the Maguscepter was King Blaervaer Lorddessar, before it was interred beneath the royal vaults of the Gateway to the West. However it was later recovered by Orbakh, clone of Manshoon and vampire leader of the Night Masks thieves guild.
