The '''''Maguscepter''''' was an [[artifact]] crafted by [[Myntharan]], courtier of the [[Shoon Imperium]] during the 5{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Maguscepter'' was a [[heavy mace]] with a shaft carved from [[shadow-wood]] that had been engraved with  [[necromantic]] [[rune]]s formed by deep red silkstone and [[tiger eye agate]]. The head of the scepter was comprised of the skull of [[Thorndaer|King Thorndaer]], which been covered with [[gold]] plating.

==Powers==
This ''+3 heavy mace'' was imbued with a number of powerful [[magic]]al powers. It inflicted [[negative energy]] when it struck a foe and stored their life force within its own reservoirs of power. When the wielder of the ''Maguscepter'' cast [[arcane]] [[spell]]s, they did not lose the magic they had memorized, but rather tapped into the life force stored that had been absorbed by the artifact in the previous 24 hours.

==History==
The scepter was crafted by Myntharan before the [[452 DR|Year of Rolling Heads, 452 DR]], when the imperial court [[wizard]] seized the throne of [[Westgate]]. The specific design and process of its creation were [[Netheril|Netherese]] in origin.

The last known mortal to wield the ''Maguscepter'' was [[Blaervaer Lorndessar|King Blaervaer Lorddessar]], before it was interred beneath the royal vaults of the ''Gateway to the West''. However it was later recovered by [[Orbakh]], clone of [[Manshoon]] and [[vampire]] leader of the [[Night Masks]] thieves' guild.
