A wagon was a four-wheeled, open-topped vehicle hauled behind a pair of horses or other beasts of burden,
An ideal wagon was about  long and about  wide. Animals that could move faster than horses could of course make a wagon travel faster.
A wagon sold for about 35 gold pieces in most economies of Faerûn,
Some wagons were equipped with a heavy or light catapult as a weapon.
Merchants often came to the various trade fairs of Faerûn, selling goods from their wagons. Wagons were sometimes also used by armies to carry siege engines to battle.
In the city of Secomber, blocking a doorway or alleyway with ones wagon was a crime punishable by fine and with an edict forbidding the driving of wagon in the city again for a set time period. Parking in front of a city gate would earn a teamster a night in jail.
* Vardo, a distinct type of wagon used by the Vistani.
