A '''wagon''' was a four-wheeled, open-topped vehicle hauled behind a pair of [[horse]]s or other beasts of burden,

==Description==
An ideal wagon was about {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} long and about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} wide. Animals that could move faster than horses could of course make a wagon travel faster.

A wagon sold for about 35 [[gold piece]]s in most economies of [[Faerûn]],

Some wagons were equipped with a heavy or light [[catapult]] as a weapon.

| source = A notice of a local (and very specific) prohibition against a certain furrier parking his wagon in the city of [[Secomber]].

Merchants often came to the various trade fairs of Faerûn, selling goods from their wagons. Wagons were sometimes also used by armies to carry [[siege engine]]s to battle.

In the city of [[Secomber]], blocking a doorway or alleyway with one's wagon was a crime punishable by fine and with an edict forbidding the driving of wagon in the city again for a set time period. Parking in front of a city gate would earn a teamster a night in jail.

==Types of Wagons==
* [[Vardo]], a distinct type of wagon used by the [[Vistani]].
