An '''''orb of draconic influence''''' was a powerful [[magic item]] that allowed a [[dragon]] to influence the behaviors of other dragons.

==Description==
The ''orbs'' were spheres of dark green [[obsidian]] decorated with intricate geometric etchings and [[gold]] filigree.

==Powers==
A dragon could use an ''orb'' to subtly influence the behaviors and dispositions of all dragons within {{SI|10|miles|k|long=yes}}. Usually, the wielder would concentrate on a single command or feeling they wished to impart on all nearby dragons, such as "attack" or "friendly."

An ''orb'' also afforded some protections to its wielder: its magic both blocked ''[[scrying]]'' of any kind and discouraged dragons and other members of [[dragonkind]] from attacking the wielder.

==History==
''Orbs of draconic influence'' were created by dragons in order to be used against other dragons. Some sages proposed a divisive theory that the ''orbs'' could be used to cause a so-called "[[dragonflight]]", the phenomenon wherein a large group of normally solitary dragons of various [[alignment]]s would suddenly decide to behave in synchronicity.
