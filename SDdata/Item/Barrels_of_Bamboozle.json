        "mainbody": "'''Barrels of Bamboozle''' were containers filled with fool's gold, [[pyrite]], that held sentimental value for [[Torleth Mindulspeer]] of [[Gillian's Hill]]. These [[barrel]]s were not for sale unlike virtually everything else within [[Torleth's Treasures]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "So-called Barrels of Bamboozle were several simple barrels, filled to the brim with rough chunks of rocks with what appeared to be [[gold]] permeating through them. However, it was only pyrite and held little substantial value.",
        "History": "These containers originally were sold by a not particularly trustworthy [[dwarf|dwarven]] merchant to a local \"almost famous\" narcissistic sculptor [[Yujist Glemp]]. Glemp sought to preserve his likeness in gold for \"posterity's sake\" to the extreme dislike by the locals of Gillian's Hill, as he wanted to gift his \"masterpiece\" to the hamlet inhabitants. The man made a poor financial discussion by deciding to take a loan from the notorious loan shark of [[Daggerford]] and Torleth Mindulspeer's bitter rival, [[Vladmyr]]. Using that loaned [[coin]], Yujist Glemp bought the \"Barrels of Bamboozle,\" thinking it was true gold. Thinking that if he were unable to pay off the loan, Glemp could use his golden statue as collateral. When Yujist realized what he has done, he fled Daggerford in terror of Vladmyr's collectors, leaving his unfinished project behind. His space was supposedly successful, as everyone in Gillian's Hill assumed him dead or mysteriously gone. When Vladmyr attempted to collect from the dimwitted sculptor, all he found were these barrels of cheap pyrite.\n\nWhen Torleth found out about Vladmyr being humiliated, he laughed so hard, he decided to take the Barrels of Bamboozle into his store as a reminder of his rival's failure. The barrels were still piled at the front part of Torleth's Treasures as of 1372 DR."
