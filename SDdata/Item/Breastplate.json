        "mainbody": "A breastplate was one of the better forms of medium armor.  \nThe armor covered the wearers front and back with a metal cuirass, and included a helmet and greaves. A light suit of studded leather beneath the breastplate finished the armor suit, protecting the wearers limbs without restricting movement much.\n* Aviss and the drow magic-user Kilili both typically wore a golden-hued breastplate.\n* Worshipers of Bane typically wore black breastplates with a red fist painted on and below the shoulder blades."
