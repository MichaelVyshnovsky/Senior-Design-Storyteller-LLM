        "mainbody": "Lamias Tongue was one-of-a-kind enchanted throwing dagger wielded by The Black Lamia, also known as Suhailah el Khaba of Calimshan, some years before the early 14 century DR.\nLamias Tongue was made using dull black steel and was engraved with an image of a barbed tongue. Its handle was crafted to have a texture of fine scales.\nWhen it hit a target, Lamias Tongue embedded itself in the victim and, momentarily after, it flew back to the owners hand. Despite being an engraving, the barbs were magical and ripped the target open when the Lamias Tongue darted away.\nLamias Tongue once belonged to Suhailah el Khaba, a renowned sell-sword of Calimport who was active some years before the . In her hands, the Tongue ended the lives of many opponents long before they could reach Suhailah, and she always aimed at their throats. Eventually, the sell-swords career ended mysteriously. Some said she was locked away in the depths of the earth after murdering a vengeful mages niece, while others repeated a more romantic story of how Suhailah fell in love with a noble from the land of the Red Wizards, Thay, and later was forced into hiding. Even though her final fate remained unrecorded, Suhailah el Khaba was gone, leaving behind numerous items of the trade behind. All ended up scattered across Faer√ªn.\nBy 1312 DR, Lamias Tongue ended up in the nest of a duo of white dragons who laired in the River Caves in the Cold Marshes of the Ice Lakes, where the Black Raven River spilled out from under the Spine of the World. The dragons stood in the way of a group of mercenaries from Targos who sought passage to the town of Kuldahar."
