A '''''druid staff''''' was a [[magic]]al [[staff]] that enabled a [[druid]] to summon and control [[animal]]s as well as cast a variety of [[spell]]s.

==Description==
The staff was made of [[oak]] and carved at the top to form the head of a wild animal, most often that of a [[boar]], [[deer]], [[eagle]], or [[wolf]].

==Powers==
In combat, the ''druid staff'' could be wielded as a ''+2 [[quarterstaff]]''.

At the expense of two charges, the staff allowed the druid to summon animals of the same kind as represented by the carved portion. All such animals within 12 miles (19 kilometers) were summoned to the druid's presence and compelled to follow his or her commands.

At the expense of one charge, the druid could exert control over any animal within sight.

Also at the cost of a single charge, the staff could be wielded as the ''[[staff of the python|python]]'' version of a ''[[staff of the serpent]]'', with the normal caution that the death of the [[snake]] resulted in the destruction of the staff.

With the expenditure of two charges, the bearer of the staff was empowered with the ability to [[call lightning]] down from the heavens, [[cure serious wounds|heal wounds]] and [[cure disease]]s, [[dispel magic|dispel]] undesirable magical effects, cause plants to quickly [[plant growth|grow]] to form a thick, entangling barrier, and to [[speak with plants|speak]] the language of the plants themselves.

Once a month (per spell), the druid was able to unleash the greater powers of the staff without expending any charges. These included the ability to ''[[conjure earth elemental]]s'', ''[[conjure fire elemental]]s'', summon a [[insect plague|horde of insects]], ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', and raise a ''[[wall of fire]]'' or a ''[[wall of thorns]]''. Upon casting one of these greater spells, that particular power could not be employed again until the druid recharged the staff in a [[Moonwell]] during the night of a full [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Genna Moonsinger]] owned a ''druid staff'' with the head of a [[bear]] carved at the top.
* [[Robyn Kendrick]] owned a more powerful version known as the ''[[Staff of the White Well]]''.
