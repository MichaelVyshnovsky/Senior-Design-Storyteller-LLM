        "mainbody": "n ale flip was a hot, alcoholic beverage popular in the Sword Coast North, especially during the colder months, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nAn ale flip was made by mixing one part rum with fifteen parts ale in a metal bowl, adding sugar according to taste, and then flash-heating it by thrusting a red-hot metal bar (called a loggerhead) into the mixture.\nThe Moon Mountain Brewery, north of Secomber, sold their light Moon Mountain Ale and Moon Rum together in what was called a topkeg, specifically for making ale flips."
