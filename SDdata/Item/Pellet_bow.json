        "mainbody": "A pellet bow was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur\nA pellet bow closely resembled a conventional bow in both construction and application. However, it deviated in its method of ammunition deployment. Instead of launching regular arrows, it featured a small sling integrated into the bowstring, designed to hold a tiny stone, clay pellet, or lead projectile. The firing technique also differed from that of a typical bow. The specialized sling enabled a significantly more powerful ejection of the projectile when compared to a conventional sling."
