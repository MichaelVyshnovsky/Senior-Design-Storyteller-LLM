'''Sugarberry pie''' was a specialty dish from the town of [[Corm Orp]] in the [[Sunset Vale]].

==Description==
When the pies came out of the oven, they were bubbling with dark, syrupy juices. They were shaped in hand-size and encased in dough so that revelers could store extra pies in their pockets.

==History==
Corm Orp's annual [[Harvest Festival]] flooded the village with dancing, singing, merriment, and food. Freshly baked sugarberry pies were served in big batches straight out of the oven. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Pel Baker]] was one of the bakers producing the sweet treats, a [[silver]] [[coin]] per handpie. [[Hin]] survivor of a Corm Orp massacre – [[Tam Acorn]], was a lover of sugarberry pies – his favorite part of the Harvest Festival.
