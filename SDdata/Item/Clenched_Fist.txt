The '''''Clenched Fist''''' was a fist-shaped [[enchanted]] [[mace]] created sometime before [[1312 DR]].

==Description==
The heavy mace was a rusty [[iron]] scepter created in the form of a hand curled into a fist.

==Powers==
The ''Clenched Fist'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment. However, the main curios magic of the ''Fist'' was its ability to generate a single [[gold]] [[coin]] per day. When the wielder of the weapon held it in their left hand and put their right palm underneath the ''Fist'', the iron hand opened up and propped a gold piece into the wielder's palm. This ability was referred to as the ''gold blessing.''

==History==
''Clenched Fist's'' origins were a mystery. Some believed that the mace was a scepter and the symbol of office in some old kingdom; however, which court or church it might've once belonged to was unknown. It was very likely, that the ''Clenched Fist'' was many hundreds of years old by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''Clenched Fist'' found its way into a small logging village of [[Shaengarne Ford]] in [[Icewind Dale]], where it could be found in the town's watermill.
