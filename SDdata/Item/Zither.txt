The '''zither''' was a stringed instrument with a flat box as its resonating body. It was played by plucking its strings, usually on a table.

==Description==
Zithers were described as having the clear and beautiful sound of [[dulcimer]]s and the flexibility of [[yarting]]s. Their lower strings were fretted and the upper strings were tuned in fourths in order to be played with the thumb of the strumming hand. They were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
