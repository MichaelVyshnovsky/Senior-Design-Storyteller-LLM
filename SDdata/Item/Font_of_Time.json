        "mainbody": "The '''''Font of Time''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] from the [[Old Empires]] that displayed life in [[Mulhorand]] during the height of their power.",
        "Description": "The fountain was [[pearl]]-white and contained within a white crystal. The ''Font'' would appear on the sands at undertermined intervals.",
        "Powers": "When looking into the waters of the ''Font of Time'' during a full moon, a viewer would witness scenes from [[Mulhorand]]'s history that appeared to be real. Gazing into the mystic waters for too long actually pulled the viewer back in time to live in ancient Mulhorand during the height of its power. The only way for the viewer to find their way back to their own time period was to discover the ''Font of Time'' in the ancient time period and gaze into its waters again.",
        "History": "Little information was known about the ''Font of Time'' save that it was located somewhere in eastern Mulhorand. Some writings about the ''Font'' were discovered in [[Nezram]]'s book entitled ''[[Unique Mageries]]''."
