A staff of fiendish darkness was a powerful magical staff of dark and evil nature.
They were first recorded long before the 14 century DR, being used by humans or drow serving demons or devils.
Such a staff was carved of polished bone or ebony and had a metal claw at one or both ends.
The staff allowed use of the darkness, animate dead, dispel magic, and summon monster IX spells the last spell could only summon nightmares. If a good-aligned creature held this staff, they were hampered in all areas until he or she put it down.
They could only be fashioned by an evil mage who knew all the spells contained within.
