        "mainbody": "Goblin totems were magical weapons crafted by goblins out of the bones of powerful monsters.\nThese weapons were generally crude. They were either fashioned or carved from bone, and had leather strips wrapped around the intended handle.\nWielding a goblin totem filled one with confidence that they could face enemies much larger than themselves, and the weapons were indeed were more deadly against larger opponents. Big hits also tended to hit a bit harder with a goblin totem.\n* The horn totem and skull totem were fashioned in the 15 century DR from the bones of an oni known as the Ogre King by his goblin worshipers.\n* A goblin totem was in the possession of the Cloudrippers tribe in the Tannath Mountains of Aglarond."
