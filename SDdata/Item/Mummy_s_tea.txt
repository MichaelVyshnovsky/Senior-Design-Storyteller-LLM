Mummys tea was a type of potion that healed afflictions.
Mummys tea was typically stored in slender, green bottles. It was known to have a foul odor.
Creation of this potion required boiling the used wrappings of a mummy alongside animal bones that had been naturally dried out.
Anyone who consumed this potion would experience effects similar to the spells cure blindness or deafness and cure disease.
Mummys tea was first developed in Mulhorand by priests of Horus-Re. By 1281 DR, it was available for purchase from a number of vendors in the region of Icewind Dale.
