'''''Elven sewn gloves''''' were minor [[enchanted]] articles of clothing found in the [[Seldarine's Hand]] citadel on the [[Spine of the World]].

==Description==
Like many of things crafted by the elves, these gloves were made using cloth and fur of the finest quality. They were hand-sewn by the inhabitants of the Seldarine's Hand and quite common during the citadel's heyday.

==Powers==
''Elven sewn gloves'' possessed minor enchantments that granter the wearer protection against magical and mundane cold.

==History==
After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|900}}, the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of [[Dorn's Deep]]. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best clothing, [[armor]], and [[weapon]]s created by the crafters of both peoples. By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. Several pairs of ''elven sewn gloves'' survived the ravages of time. By the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, these gloves could be found in the town of [[Targos]] of [[Icewind Dale]], namely, in the hands of [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]], the wife of Speaker [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]].
