        "Description": "The robe was usually made with cotton, but finer versions could be crafted from [[silk]] or brocade. When worn, a [[sash]] was used as a belt around the waist. Nearly every woman in [[Calimshan]] would dress in a caftan. A typical caftan had a base value of 1 gp, but more elaborate ones could cost up to 20 gp."
