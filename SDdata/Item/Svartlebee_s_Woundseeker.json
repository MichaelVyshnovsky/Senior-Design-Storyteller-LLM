        "mainbody": "Svartlebees Woundseeker was a unique enchanted greatsword that once was famously wielded by Svartlebee the Custodian, sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nThe Woundseeker possessed a minor +1 enchantment that guided the blade towards the target and increased its deadliness. Additionally, the weapon was especially effective against opponents who had already suffered damageâ€”each subsequent slash with the blade resulted in it deepening the wounds, in turn causing heavier damage and leaving bleeding lacerations behind.\nThe Woundseeker belonged to Svartlebee the Custodian, a mercenary who used the weapon to remove nuisances from peoples lives and cleaned up the crime scenes afterwards. Subsequently, the blade changed owners, eventually falling into the hands of the Flaming Fist Gauntlet Yeva, who accompanied Duke Ulder Ravengard on a mission to Elturel in the , and survived an attack from the Cult of the Absolute in the Waukeens Rest roadside inn."
