        "mainbody": "nomish cloaks were special cloaks worn by some rogues.\nThese wonderful cloaks were expertly crafted with grey fabrics that created a textured look, allowing a prowling thief to blend into the shadows with more conviction.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold standard gnomish cloaks for 10 gold pieces, as well as ones big enough to completely cover a large individual for 12 gp. The catalogue noted that, while they were not nearly as grand as cloaks of elvenkind, gnomish cloaks made a find addition to any rogues wardrobe."
