The '''''necromancer's robe''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[robe]] that protected the wearer from [[death magic]].

==Powers==
Despite its unassuming appearance, the ''necromancer's robe'' gave the wearer a chance to negate death magic spells tossed at them and offered protection from magic.

==History==
The ''necromancer's robe'' creator was a member of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]] who used the robe to protect himself during procurement of certain exotic items for the [[arcane]] research. However, ''necromancer's robe'' did little to save the [[wizard]]'s life when he made an enemy of a ranking member of the [[Plague Rats]]. Several years later, the robe was purchased from the Rats by [[Presio]], an evil [[necromancer]]-[[priestess]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Presio served [[marilith]] named [[Yxunomei]] who laired in the [[Dragon's Eye]] along with her forces. With Presio's death at the hands of the Heroes of Icewind Dale, the robe changed owners once again.
