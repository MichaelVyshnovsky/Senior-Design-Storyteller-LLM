The Sunwalkers Gift was an enchanted ring that could be used as a source of daylight.
The Sunwalkers Gift was a simple silvery metal band with a single blood-red gem stone embedded into it.
The magic of the Sunwalkers Gift was held within the gem. The gem glowed with daylight, parting the darkness and shadows.
In 1492 DR, the Sunwalkers Gift was in possession of a orog member of the Society of Brilliance, Blurg, who was operating out of a peaceful myconid colony in the Underdark, working to improve the living conditions of the subterranean realm.
