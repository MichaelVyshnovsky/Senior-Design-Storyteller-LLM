        "mainbody": "anopic jars were a type of container used across many parts of the Realms to store preserved internal organs.\nthumb|273px|A mummy standing next to canopic jars that classically have the likenesses of varied animals.\nThese jars were typically made from pottery, like ceramics or clay, or carved from limestone. but some simply had religious hieroglyphs painted on or etched into them.\nCanopic jars were considered to be an essential item for the creation of mummies and mummy lords. After being used to store a mummys internal organs, the jars had to be kept in the same tomb as it. Some sages claimed that canopic jars stored the life force of a mummy, a relationship akin to a lich and their phylactery, and that destroying the jars could in turn destroy the mummy whose organs they preserved. Though others argued that this was not necessarily true of all mummies.\nBeyond mummification, some used canopic jars simply for the purposes of burial or keeping organs preserved for later magical research, as was the case with the ancient star elves.\n* Some kept canopic jars within decoy chambers of their tombs, holding the organs of the servants they had in life. Such was the case with Brysis of Khaem and Valin Sarnaster.\n* Canopic jars were used in the tombs of the ancient sarrukh such as in the Maze of Sseth.\nthumb|Mystic Carrions canopic jar.\n* Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord in the late 15 century DR, who hid two of his canopic jars within the Undercity of Baldurs Gate and the third in the citys mortuary.\n* In the ancient city-state of Cursrah, canopic jars were kept by the kingdoms priests for the purposes of mummification.\n* As a burial practice, canopic jars were placed in the tombs of the ancient Mulhorandi rulers of Thay.\n* Beyond the Prime Material, canopic jars could be found in the Domain of Dread known as HarAkir, often serving as mist talismans. In the Shadowfell city of Evernight, they were used for decoration and could be purchased at the Corpse Market."
