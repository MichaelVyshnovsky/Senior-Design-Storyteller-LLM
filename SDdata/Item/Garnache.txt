A garnache was a type of outer-garment found in the Realms.
The garnache was best described as being a sort of long cloak with wide cape-like, elbow-length sleeves. It covered the wearer from their neck down to their ankles. The sleeve design of a garnache allowed bulky items (like pouches or weapons) to be hidden beneath them without attracting attention to the wearer.
* Many fighters and thieves favored the garnache due to the ease with which they could hide things in it without hindering their movement.
* In the nation of Tethyr, the garnache was common garment among wizards.
