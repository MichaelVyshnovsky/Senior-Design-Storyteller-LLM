A tetsubo () was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur.
The tetsubo, also known as the iron-shod rod, was essentially a polearm variant of the mace. It consisted of a wooden rod  in length intended to be wielded with both hands, with the upper portion adorned by iron strips embedded with studs. Notably, this versatile weapon was favored by travelers for its dual functionality as both a formidable weapon and a practical walking stick.
