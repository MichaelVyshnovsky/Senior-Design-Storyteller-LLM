A '''tetsubo''' ({{Pronounce|teh|tsoo|boh|refs=}}) was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The tetsubo, also known as the iron-shod rod, was essentially a [[polearm]] variant of the [[mace]]. It consisted of a wooden rod {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} in length intended to be wielded with both hands, with the upper portion adorned by [[iron]] strips embedded with studs. Notably, this versatile weapon was favored by travelers for its dual functionality as both a formidable weapon and a practical walking stick.
