==History==
Pork was a staple food in [[north Faerûn]] since the days of ancient [[Netheril]].

High demand among the nobles of [[Chessenta]] made pork one of their most important imports as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] owing to the fact that few pigs were raised in the realm itself.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the merchant [[Alsimur Droon]] manufactured a shortage of salt pork along the [[Sword Coast]], allowing him to capitalize on the desperate demand.

==Trivia==
The flavor and texture of pork was said to be similar to the meat of wyverns,  and [[subterranean lizard]]s. Pork when flavored with [[chives]] was also said to simulate the taste of [[stirge]] meat.

Pork was one of the favorite foods of the average [[beholder]]. [[Peryton]]s were not over fond of it.
