{{quote
|A scourge? Why would any self-respecting [[adventurer]] want one? Those dreaded things are most associated with torture, not combat. . . . carrying a scourge will probably mark someone as a follower of some cruel, torturing deity, or at the very least, as an evil person. Any adventurer with a shred of decency will avoid the scourge and get something that will put an enemy out of its misery, not prolong it!
