'''Vauge tea''' was a beverage made by steeping parts of the [[vauge]] plant in hot water. It was available in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], at the popular blurdren (food counter) called [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] near the north gate of the city, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Vauge tea was free to customers who brought their own cup, or 1 [[cp]] if served in one of Munsrum's dented metal cups.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}
