Ironhands Reckoning was an enchanted greatsword from the Moonshae Isles.
The greatsword was enchanted to help the wielder strike and harm any kind of giant. The rumbling pain of slain giants could be heard when holding this weapon.
Thelgaar Ironhand, King of Oman during the 14 century DR, wielded Ironhands Reckoning. The sword was believed to be buried with him in his cairn within the Old Stone Wood on Omans Isle.
Replicas of this weapon were crafted by the same blacksmith who forged the original, but none were as powerful as Ironhands Reckoning. The replicas were given to Helgaars loyal followers.
