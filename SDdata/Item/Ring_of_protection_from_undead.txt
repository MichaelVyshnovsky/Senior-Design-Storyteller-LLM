A ring of protection from undead was an enchanted ring that protected the wearer when undead tried to touch them.
These rings were made from white gold. The insignia of Horus-Re adorned the front of the band.
When undead tried to touch the wearer they could expend a single charge from the ring to prevent contact. The wearer could only use this function for attacks that they could see coming. A ring of protection from undead typically had between 28â€”55 charges.
