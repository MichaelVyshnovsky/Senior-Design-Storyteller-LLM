The '''''Bag of Nails''''' was the enchanted [[quiver]] that belonged to its namesake, a [[tabaxi]] hunter [[Bag of Nails]] in late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Bag of Nails''' enchantment increased its owner's speed drastically, being invaluable to [[ranger]]s and other users of [[bow]]s.

==History==
This magic item's original name was unrevealed, but it belonged to an aging hunter of the city of [[Omu]], Bag of Nails. The only thing the tabaxi wanted in his old age was the hunter's death; however, Bag went mad in his advanced years. Eventually, the enchanted quiver found its way into the hands of the immortal [[bara]] of [[Mezro]] from [[Cormyr]], [[Artus Cimber]]. He named this piece of enchanted gear after its previous owner.
