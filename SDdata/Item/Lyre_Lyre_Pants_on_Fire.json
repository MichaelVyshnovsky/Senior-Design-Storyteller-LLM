        "mainbody": "A Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire was a enchanted musical instrument that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.\nThe overall appearance of the instrument was similar to that of a Cli lyre. The black body of the instrument was surrounded by a metallic amber-colored material formed into the shape of two humanoid faces with horns and breathing fire around the sound hole at the center of the item. A Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire had eight strings.\nIt allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and set opponents ablaze. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\nIn contrast to other magical instruments, the powers of the Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire could be used effectively by non-bards as well. It did not seem to require any other musical skills either.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Lyre Lyre Pants on Fires could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such instruments were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon."
