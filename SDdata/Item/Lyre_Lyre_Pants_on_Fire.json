        "mainbody": "A '''''Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire''''' was a [[enchanted]] [[musical instrument]] that likely fell into the possession of several [[adventurer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The overall appearance of the instrument was similar to that of a ''[[Cli lyre]]''. The black body of the instrument was surrounded by a metallic amber-colored material formed into the shape of two [[humanoid]] faces with horns and breathing [[fire]] around the sound hole at the center of the item. A ''Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire'' had eight strings.",
        "Powers": "It allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and set opponents ablaze. However, this ability had varying recovery periods before it could be used again.\n\nIn contrast to other magical instruments, the powers of the ''Lyre Lyre Pants on Fire'' could be used effectively by non-[[bard]]s as well. It did not seem to require any other [[Music|musical]] skills either.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Lyre Lyre Pants on Fires'' could be found in [[Neverwinter]], [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Mount Hotenow]], and [[Neverwinter Wood]]. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such instruments were likely found by the adventurers that stopped [[Deathsleep]], the [[green dragon]]."
