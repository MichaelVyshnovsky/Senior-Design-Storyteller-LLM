The origin and terminus of each ''portal'' was tied to a general area, but not to a specific location as with other ''portals''. The radius where each ''portal'' traveled was set when it was created and extended up to {{SI|1000|ft|long=yes}}. The ''portals'' moved randomly to include up into the air, but their movement could be controlled if the creator of the ''portal'' concentrated.",
        "History": "These ''portals'' were originally created by the Mad Mage [[Halaster Blackcloak]]."
