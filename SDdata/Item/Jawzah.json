        "mainbody": "A jawzah () was a stringed fiddle-like Zakharan instrument.\nA jawzah resembled a thin spiked fiddle with four strings connected to a small soundbox made from a hollowed-out coconut shell. A bow made from horsehair was used to play the instrument.\nSince coconuts were used for the soundbox of a jawzah, these instruments were popular among the sailors and travelers of the Golden Gulf and the ports surrounding it."
