        "Powers": "''Flaming orbs'' helped wizards to focus their arcane energies, increasing the destructive power of their [[spell]]s. Additionally, these orbs quickened the wielder's reaction and allowed them to find vulnerabilities in the spell targets.",
        "History": "In the 15{{th}} century DR, various ''orbs of dominance'' could be found among spellcasters of the [[Sword Mountains]], areas surrounding the city and markets of [[Neverwinter]]. One such item was among [[Fletcher Thane]]'s possessions in the late 15{{th}} century DR, another was in the [[undead]] hands of the [[vampire lord]] [[Ozit]] who laired in the ruined [[Illefarn]]."
