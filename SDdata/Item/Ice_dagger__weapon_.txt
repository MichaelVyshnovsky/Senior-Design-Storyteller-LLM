'''Ice daggers''' were a unique enchanted weapons used exclusively by specialty [[priest]]s of [[Auril]] called [[chillbringer]]s.<ref name="WaPotR-p67" >

==Powers==
Ice daggers made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. In addition to physical harm, ice daggers caused chilling cold within the wounds they inflicted.

==History==
These weapons were made by high-ranking clergy of Auril during the [[Feast of the Moon]] using ice taken from the [[Great Glacier]]. The magic infusing the weapon allowed it to last until [[Greengrass]].
