The '''''Cadorna family sword''''' was an [[enchanted]] commemorative [[greatsword]] created for the famous, or rather infamous "dragon killer family" of [[Phlan]], [[House Cadorna]].

==Description==
The greatsword was a masterfully crafted [[cold iron]] blade. It was decorated with intricately engraved ornamentations along the blade, some of which were damaged by use throughout the years. The greatsword's blade on one side contained an engraved Cadorna family history that began with a weaver's [[loom]] and ended in a grand [[dragon]] battle. The other side held an engraved family tree with the last engraving as of [[1351 DR]] on its hilt reading: "To Skullcrusher, For All Your Service – P. Cadorna, 1351 DR."

==Powers==
As the ''Cadorna family sword'' was made out of cold iron, the blade was deadly to [[fey]] creatures, [[celestial eladrin]], and [[demon]]s. It also possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand and ensured increased damage with each slash. The sword's edge was ensorcelled with a ''[[keen]]'' magic that kept it sharp and gave it the potential to deal especially devastating damage.

==History==
The ''Cadorna family sword'' was forged to commemorate the 15{{th}} anniversary of the Cadorna family becoming famous and respected after [[Magnus Cadorna]] slew a dangerous [[red dragon]] who ravaged settlements of the [[Dragon Reach]]. When it was presented to Magnus, now an eighty-two-year-old man, he was thankful but considered the gesture quite silly.

The blade would remain with the Cadorna family, passed from father to son for four generations until it eventually left the "dragon killer" family's possession. The last Cadorna who wielded the blade was the infamous [[Porphyrys Cadorna]], son of [[Eugenia Cadorna]], the Cloth Merchant of Phlan.

After the man's disgrace and being run out of town, the sword remained with Porphyrys for about ten years, until the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, when Porphyrys, still without an offspring, gifted the sword to his trusted bodyguard [[Skullcrusher (Phlan)|Skullcrusher]]. Skullcrusher kept the sword close through his adventuring career and brought it to his secluded cottage in the [[Neverwinter Wood]] after he retired. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Skullcrusher was in his twilight years and often thought of what would happen to his possessions, namely magic weapons, after his inevitable death.
