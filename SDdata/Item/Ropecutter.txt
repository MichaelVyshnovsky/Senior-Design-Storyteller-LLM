Ropecutters were common enchanted kama used by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords.
Seemingly ordinary kama, ropecutters were created to slash through ship ropes during boardings and emergencies. However, when on dry land, owners of ropecutters often used kamas minor enchantments to improve their thieving abilities.
Ropecutters were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered these kama for sale.
