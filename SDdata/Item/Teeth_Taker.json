        "mainbody": "The Teeth Taker was a unique enchanted mace created to be used against the lizardfolk threat of the Lizard Marsh.\nWhen wielded against lizardfolk, the Teeth Taker effectively became a +5 enchanted mace. Additionally, the maces magics left freeze-burns on its targets.\nThis enchanted mace was created in the city of Daggerford in order to combat the constant threat of lizardfolk attacks that came from the Lizard Marsh sometime before 1372 DR. The weapons owner was Roline \"the Hand\" Tark, a caravan guard who famously and successfully wielded the Teeth Taker against the scaled humanoids. With time, Roline stopped numerous lizardmen attacks on her employers and collected numerous lizardfolk teeth as trophies. She was able to sell these teeth to a collector and amassed a small fortune. The name Teeth Taker was given to the weapon by the lizardfolk themselves as a sign of respect for the mace and its wielder.\nBy 1372 DR, the Teeth Taker ended up in the scaly hands of Saslick, the leader of one of the lizardfolk tribes that inhabited the Lizard Marsh."
