Netheril
The Crystal Chain of Binding was a powerful Netherese artifact that could strip any spellcaster from tapping into the Weave.
Unique in its function, the Crystal Chain held the consciousnesses of many senior wizards who sought to achieve a form of immortality when their bodies ultimately succumbed to age. While the personality of each contained mage varied, they all shared the same wisdom regarding the correct, and incorrect, uses of the arcane arts.
The Crystal Chain was forged in Netheril, centuries before Dale Reckoning, and thought to be lost forever after the ancient empire collapsed. For hundreds of years, men, elves, and dwarves alike all sought the artifact for their own use.
It was finally recovered in the early-to-mid 3 century DR, by the magelord Neldryn Hawklyn of Athalantar. It did not remain in his possession for long however, as it was then claimed by the then-magister, Dorgon Heamiiolothtar.
