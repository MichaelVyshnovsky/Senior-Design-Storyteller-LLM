        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of rulership''''' enabled its wielder to impose his or her will to would-be subjects. They felt a wave of compulsion washing over them, a telepathic call to fall to their knees and obey the wielder. Persons of strong mind could withstand its effect though. The rod appeared as a jeweled scepter wrought of solid gold. It was often favored by chieftains and tribal leaders.",
        "Powers": "These items were even more potent when wielded by the [[dreadmaster]]s of [[Bane]]."
