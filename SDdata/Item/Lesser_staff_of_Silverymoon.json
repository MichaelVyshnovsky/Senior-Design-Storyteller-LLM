        "mainbody": "A '''''lesser staff of Silverymoon''''' was a type of [[magic]]al [[staff]] that was often given to trusted agents of [[Alustriel Silverhand]], High Lady of [[Silverymoon]].",
        "Description": "The ''lesser staffs of Silverymoon'' were made primarily of a deep [[weirwood]], itself engraved with inlays of [[silver]], and each had a [[moonstone]] at its peak that would glow softly.",
        "Powers": "A ''lesser staff of Silverymoon'' contained a variety of magical [[spell]]s that its user could cast, bestowing upon them an ''[[arcane sight]]'' or allowing them to ''[[fly]]'', as well as protecting themselves through the use of a ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]''. They could restrain their enemies through the use of ''[[forcecage]]'' or ''[[hold monster]]'', or even create a ''[[wall of force]]''. In a more offensive capacity, a ''lesser staff of Silverymoon'' could also cast a ''[[chain lightning]]'' spell. The staff also allowed them to ''[[animate objects]]'', or make use of a ''[[dimension door]]'' or ''[[passwall]]'' passage.",
        "History": "The ''lesser staffs of Silverymoon'' were created by the city's High Lady, Alustriel, Although there were less than twelve of them, and, around 500 years later, as of {{Yearlink|1374}}, at least one of these staffs remained in [[Hellgate Keep]]'s ruins. \n\nThe majority were kept in Alustriel's personal vaults or were wielded by other [[wizards]] whom she entrusted them to. Even upon relinquishing her rulership over the city of Silverymoon, she would occasionally bestow one of the ''lesser staffs of Silverymoon'' to those who had proven themselves to be good and worthy, and who wished to help the blossoming state of [[Luruar]]."
