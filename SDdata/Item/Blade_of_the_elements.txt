The '''''blade of the elements''''' was a magical [[katana]] from [[Kara-Tur]] that may have appeared in [[Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Lord [[Sunang]] of Kara-Tur was forced to make alliances and purchase magical weapons like the ''blade of the elements'' when his lands were besieged by the forces of a mighty [[wu-jen]]. However, this strategy proved very costly: Sunang was near-bankrupted and his influence waned, while his enemy continued to grow in power. Ultimately, Sunang's realm collapsed from its own weaknesses, not to conquest. It was supposed that the profit-hungry merchants supplied arms to both sides, but proof was lost to history.

The ''blade of the elements'' may have turned up in the [[Sword Coast North]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Description==
The katana was observed to have a guard, with either a tassel hanging from the guard or a brown cloth wrapped around the lower half of the blade.

==Powers==
A ''blade of the elements'' was a ''+3 katana'' that could slay an [[elemental]] on impact.
