The mask of the shapeshifter was an enchanted decorative helmet from the late 15 century DR.
The full-head-covering helmet resembled a collection of four faces, with one of them resembling that of a humanoid lizard creature. The mask allowed the wearer to cast the disguise self spell at will, making it an invaluable tool for actors, detectives, or just those who had a mirror and some time to kill.
The mask of the shapeshifters history was a mysterious and a gory one. Reportedly, the items magic came from some bloody event in the past. The mask of the shapeshifter could be found in the Western Heartlands, along the banks of the River Chionthar in the late 15 century DR.
