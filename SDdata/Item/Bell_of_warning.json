        "mainbody": "A bell of warning was a type of small magical bell from the land of Kara-Tur that could detect the presence of anyone approaching it covertly.\nThese bells measured  in length and  in diameter.\nActivating a bell of warning required hanging it, such as upon a branch or rafter, and then speaking its command word is spoken. Each activation used up a magical charge, with each bell having upwards of 30 charges, and lasted for around 3 to 18 hours.\nWhile activate a bell of warning would ring whenever any creature came within  from either the Astral plane or Ethereal plane. It likewise would sound from any creatures that were invisible or attempting to move stealthily or silently. This ringing would then persist until a bell of warning either deactivated or the detected presence moved outside of its effective radius.\n* Ayana No-Shui, a powerful wu-jen.\n* The Horseshoe Temple in the Quoya Desert had a bell of warning amongst its collection of magical instruments. When the temple was later overran by oni in 1358 DR, it was amongst the items that survived.\n* Lui-hsia Chih, a leader of the Many-Hued Peacock Society.\nAround  to early , a group of bakemono took up residence in the long abandoned Lihat Observatory, believing it held unusual weaponry inside. As part of establishing defenses within the observatory, the bakemono placed  bell of warning in the anteroom to alert them of any intruders.No date is given for Ronin Challenge, nor its companion adventure Test of the Samurai. However, it includes Kara-Turan characters from Hall of Heroes, which is dated to 1358 DR, and is set after the unfinished events detailed there. In particular, it seems at least \"about a year\" later for the Earth Spider. On the other hand, it includes characters featured in Dragonwall, which is dated to 1359/1360 DR, which clearly occurs later for them. In particular, Ting Mei Wan was recently made a minister in Ronin Challenge and has been minister for two years by the time of Dragonwall. These narrow the main events of Ronin Challenge to late 1358 DR or early 1359 DR."
