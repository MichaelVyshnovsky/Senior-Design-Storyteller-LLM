The Armor of Landfall was a set of druidic light armor that granted the wearer the ability to grow plant life magically, found in the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
The Armor of Landfall had a distinct non-unpleasant aroma of a wild garden of roses, moss, and hibiscus.
This light armor possessed the power to boost the wearers spellcasting abilities, guiding their spells towards the targets. It also granted them an upper hand in resisting constitution-draining spells and effects. Lastly, the wearer could invoke druidic magic to cast the plant growth spell once per day, and whilst the wearer of the Armor of Landfall stood amidst the magically created plants, they received small amounts of magical healing.
The Armor of Landfall was once worn by a powerful but reclusive druid sometime before the , when the druidic garb found its way into the stock of the Sorcerous Sundries in Baldurs Gate.
