'''Banded agate''' was an [[ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] used in furniture inlays, inexpensive [[:Category:Brooches|brooches]], and carried as a "soothe stone"&mdash;to be fondled or rubbed between the fingers in order to prevent nervous fidgeting&mdash;by merchants during tense negotiations.

==Description==
This stone was a form of opaque [[wikipedia:en:quartz|quartz]] with striations of brown, red, blue, and/or white. It was normally tumbled or polished smooth and had a waxy feel. A typical stone had a base value of 10 [[gp]].

==Powers==
A pinch of crushed banded agate powder was traditionally added to sleeping draughts to improve their effectiveness, but there was no solid evidence to justify this practice. Banded agate powder was used as an ingredient in some inks for inscribing [[spells]] and in the base mixture for some [[potion]]s.

==Reputation==
Banded agate was a common stone, a gem worn by drow of average station. They prized those of blue and red striping the most.
