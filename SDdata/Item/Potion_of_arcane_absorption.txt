Potions of arcane absorption were a rare type of potion that protected the imbiber from spells and magical effects. 
These potions were typically kept in wide-neck ceramic jars in the Northwest Faer√ªn. Each contained enough liquid for one full dose. 
Potions of arcane absorption gave the imbiber protection against magic via absorption and negating of the offensive spells and magical effects. The effects of the potion were permanent.
