        "mainbody": "'''''Battle robes''''' were seven [[enchanted]] [[robe]]s famously worn by the [[Seven Scourges]], a mercenary company from [[Waterdeep]], active sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Powers": "These black and red robes possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and granted the wearer the ability to cast magics in combat with ease and decreased the chance of the spells being miscast. Additionally, these robes enchanted the wearer's fortitude and gave them the ability to cast the ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' once per day.",
        "History": "Seven of these robes were commissioned by [[Amian Niast]], a well-known merchant from the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. She outfitted her elite guard members with the ''battle robes'' and christened them the Seven Scourges. Under her command, the Scourges became one of the most feared groups among the mercantile folk of Waterdeep. Eventually, five members of the Seven Scourges rebelled against their brutish employer and took over her merchant business. In the process, they slew Amian Niast herself, her son, and other Scourges who remained loyal to their mistress.\n\nBy 1372 DR, one of the seven ''battle robes'' fell into the hands of an undead [[wizard]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] and after he was destroyed by intolerant [[paladin]]s, remained with the wizard's [[familiar]], [[Boonmoppet]]."
