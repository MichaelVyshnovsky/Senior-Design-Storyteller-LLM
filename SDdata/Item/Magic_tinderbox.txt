A magic tinderbox was a tinderbox enchanted for better reliability. It was invented by the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist.
A magic tinderbox resembled a perfectly ordinary tinderbox, being a set of typical tools for making a fire, including a piece of flint and steel and dry materials to burn. These were kept inside an engraved wooden box to keep them dry.
The tools of a magic tinderbox were used in the same way as those of a traditional tinderbox. The flint-and-steel was enchanted to always create sufficient sparks to ignite a fire. This worked in wind and rain, though extreme conditions such as a gale or torrential downpour were too great for proper functioning.
The Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist developed the magic tinderbox in the 1360s DR. His technique circulated in Faer√ªn, and magic tinderboxes came to be used by several well-equipped adventuring companies.
Daltim wrote details of the magic tinderbox and notes for creating one in his spellbook Daltims Tome of Fire, which he lost in Tethyr in the 1360s DR.
