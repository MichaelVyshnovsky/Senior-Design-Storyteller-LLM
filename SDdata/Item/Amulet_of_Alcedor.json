The sapphire hung on a chain of platinum links.\nWhen activated by being touched or with a comnmand word, the amulet activated. The hand opened up, and shot a beam of blue light at its target, enveloping them in Alcedors magic. The victims held by the magic of the amulet also fell under the influence of a vampiric touch spell, feeling their life force drain away to heal the wearer of the amulet if they so desired.\nThe amulet of Acledor was created by Alcedor Kolat and always worn by him."
