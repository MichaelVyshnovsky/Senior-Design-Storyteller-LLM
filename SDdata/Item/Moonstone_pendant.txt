The '''''moonstone pendant''''' was an enchanted [[cleric]] [[amulet]] from [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The [[silver]] ''moonstone pendant'' appeared as two interlocking crescents, facing each other. The new moons left an opening in the middle of the pendant that glowed with gentle blue light.

==Powers==
The ''moonstone pendant'' gave the wearer the ability to cast the ''[[regenerate]]'' spell and mirrored its effects onto up to three allies in close proximity.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: A [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
