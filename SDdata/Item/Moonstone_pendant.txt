The moonstone pendant was an enchanted cleric amulet from Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
The silver moonstone pendant appeared as two interlocking crescents, facing each other. The new moons left an opening in the middle of the pendant that glowed with gentle blue light.
The moonstone pendant gave the wearer the ability to cast the regenerate spell and mirrored its effects onto up to three allies in close proximity.
