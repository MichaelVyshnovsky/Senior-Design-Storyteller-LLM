The '''o-yoroi''' was a type of [[armor]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The o-yoroi was a comprehensive ensemble of laced armor, comprising various components such as [[kote]], [[do-maru]], [[sode]], [[haidate]], [[kabuto]], and [[sune-ate]]. Additionally, it included several smaller pieces, including the mempo (face mask), nodawa (neck guard), wakibiki (armpit guards), sendan-no-ita, and hato-wo-no-ita (guards for the front of the armpit).

Crafted as a matched set, the o-yoroi exhibited harmonious colors and patterns that complemented each other. This not only enhanced the visual appeal but also improved the overall fit of the armor, resulting in a superior armor compared to a collection of mismatched pieces.
