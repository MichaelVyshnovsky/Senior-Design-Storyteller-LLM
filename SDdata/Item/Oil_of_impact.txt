'''''Oil of impact''''' was a very explosive magical substance. The priest [[Cadderly Bonaduce]] was known to use this oil in his youth. A typical vial of this oil had a base value of 5,000 gp.

==Ingredients==
Only some of the exotic ingredients were known that were needed in the process of brewing the ''Oil of Impact'' - for example [[hill giant]] fingernails and crushed oxen horn. An alchemical device was needed to blend all ingredients together - and a very careful hand to not cause the oil to blow up in the process of brewing.

==Utilization==
The oil could be transported in glass vials. Cadderly designed [[crossbow]] darts to hold the oil. These darts were small and narrow and made of iron except for silver caps. The centers of the darts were hollowed out to leave room for tiny glass vials filled with the oil. In case those darts impacted on a hard surface (such as a wall, limb of a tree or even an [[Orog|orog's]] torso) the vial collapsed and the oil exploded.<ref>

==History==
[[Vicero Belago]] of the Edificant Library would often undergo the incredibly dangerous and expensive procedure to make the oil, usually upon request of Cadderly.

==Notable Users==
===Regions & Settlements===
* Among the [[warrior]]s of the [[drow]] city of [[Sshamath]], this oil was commonly carried while out on patrol.<ref>
