'''Rellanic''' was an [[elven]] script that was better known in worlds such as [[Nerath]] and [[Eberron]]. Its characters were described as "flowing". It was used to transcribe [[Deep Speech]] sometimes thanks to the [[drow]], and was the most common language for matters of the [[Far Realm]] for the same reason.

The warlock [[Japheth Donard]] employed Rellanic symbology in an improvised ritual on {{yearlink|1396}}.{{cite book/City of Torment|56|6}}
