Golden chalice of Lathander was an enchanted gold chalice imbued with Lathanders divine magic.
The chalices of Lathander were finely crafted out of pure gold and were decorated or engraved with symbols of a sun rising on a rose in full bloom.
Upon the use of the chalices command word, the item started shedding bright light, similar to that of the light spell. The light ability of the chalice could be activated any number times a day and it did not consume one of the items three charges. The activation of the chalices healing circle spell, on the other hand, consumed one of its charges. When all three charges had been expended, the chalice still retained its light-giving magic.
In 1372 DR, a golden chalice of Lathander could be received in exchange for a grand donation from the temple of Lathander, Moonglow Tower, in Daggerford.
In 1374 DR, a golden chalice of Lathander could be purchased in the Blacklake Districts temple of Lathander in Neverwinter. Another chalice could be found in the ruined temple in the swamps outside West Harbor.
