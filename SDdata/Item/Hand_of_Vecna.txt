The '''''Hand of Vecna''''' was a powerful and [[evil]] [[artifact]] that granted its wearer access to supernatural strength and powerful [[spell]]s.

==Description==
The ''Hand'' was a desiccated, mummified left hand. In order to use its powers, the wielder needed to cut off his or her own left hand at the wrist and press the ''Hand of Vecna'' against the remainder of the arm. The artifact then magically grafted itself onto its wearer and became a functioning limb. Removing the ''Hand of Vecna'' invariably killed its wearer.

==Powers==
Once attuned to the ''Hand of Vecna'', a creature changed its worldview towards a [[neutral evil]] disposition. The artifact granted supernatural strength to its wearer, as well as a boost of cold energy to spells and attacks dealt with a weapon held by it.

In addition, the ''Hand of Vecna'' allowed its wearer to cast the ''[[finger of death]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[slow]]'', and ''[[teleport]]'' spells a limited number of times. It progressively regained its magic every dawn. Using the artifact to cast any spells caused it to demand its wearer to commit an evil act shortly thereafter, in a manner similar to the ''[[suggestion]]'' spell.

If both the ''Eye'' and the ''Hand'' were to be attuned to the same creature, the wearer enjoyed numerous additional benefits, such as immunity to [[disease]] and [[poison]], premonitions of imminent danger, the ability to turn an opponent's skeleton into [[jelly]] by touching it with the ''Hand'', regeneration powers, and the ability to cast ''[[wish]]'' once every 30 days.

==History==
The ''Hand of Vecna'' and the ''[[Eye of Vecna]]'' were the only remnants of the powerful [[lich]] [[Vecna]], after he was betrayed and killed by his lieutenant [[Kas]]. The two appendages were left with a fragment of the lich's will and attempted to work his deeds wherever they went.

==Reputation==
It was said that the only way to permanently destroy the ''Hand of Vecna'' was if both the ''Hand'' and the ''Eye of Vecna'' were attached to the same creature, and then that creature was slain by the artifact known as the ''[[Sword of Kas]]''. Any other attempt to destroy either artifact merely transported it into a hidden vault in an unknown location.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Arkhan]] acquired the ''Hand of Vecna'' after a brief visit to the world of [[w:c:criticalrole:Exandria|Exandria]], and attempted to harness its power to free [[Tiamat]] from her prison in [[Avernus]]. The artifact was slowly corrupting and decomposing the left side of his body.
