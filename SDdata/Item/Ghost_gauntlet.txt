Ghost gauntlets were a variety of enchanted gauntlets that allowed one to both harm ghosts and be partially incorporeal like them.
These gauntlets were made of a pale, grey metal that seemed almost transparent at times.
Upon a ghost gauntlet being equipped it would fade into a near complete transparency, leaving behind tattoo-like runes along the wearers fingers, and activates all its effects.
The effects of a ghost gauntlet included temporarily imbuing the ghost touch quality onto any weapon wielded with them. The ability to make parts of the gauntlet, along with the corresponding parts of the hand inside, incorporeal. And the ability to once per day touch and then transport an object to a distant location on the Ethereal plane, much like the teleport object spell.
* The cambion Kaanyr Vhok owned a ghost gauntlet around 1374 DR.
