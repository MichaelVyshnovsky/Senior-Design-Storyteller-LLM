        "mainbody": "The '''''gauntlets of infernal damnation''''' were a type of [[cursed]] set of gloves.",
        "Description": "These gloves were made of a hard, black leather.",
        "Powers": "Being a cursed item, these gloves became affixed to whoever put them on and they could only be removed by the [[spell]] ''[[remove curse]]''. In addition, upon donning these gloves the spell ''[[shroud of flame]]'' would be cast upon the wearer.",
        "History": "Some time prior to the late-13{{th}} century [[DR]], a sinister [[priest]]ess of [[Beshaba]] invented this type of cursed item. Wealthy [[adventurer]]s would occasionally buy these to place in their treasure hordes as traps for potential [[thieves]].\n\nIn [[1281 DR]], a pair of ''gauntlets of infernal damnation'' were found within the [[Dorn's_Deep#Wyrm's_Tooth_Glacier|Wyrm's Tooth Glacier]] in the possession of a tribe of [[frost giant]]s led by [[Joril Frostbeard]]."
