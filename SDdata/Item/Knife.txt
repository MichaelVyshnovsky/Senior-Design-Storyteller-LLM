Knives were a common sort of cutting tool used in everyday life, with a multitude of potential functions. Knives resembled daggers, but tended to be smaller and used for non-combat purposes.
The average knife was a small single-edged, pointed blade, but they could also be serrated or hooked for specialized purposes. Typical heavy-duty blades were usually made from iron or steel, but dining cutlery could make use of brass and silver designs, and knapped flint or sharpened bone could also serve as cutting tools.
Knives and other small blades were often kept sharp through the regular use of a leather strop, a stiff piece of treated leather.
