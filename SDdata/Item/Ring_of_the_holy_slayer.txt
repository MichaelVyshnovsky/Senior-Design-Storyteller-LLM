'''''Rings of the holy slayer''''' were magical rings that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. These special rings were only used by [[holy slayer]]s.

==Powers==
These rings pumped deadly poison into the wearer when a command word was uttered. The fanatical holy slayers wore these rings to avoid being captured and questioned. Once slain, the deceased holy slayer could not be interrogated through ''speak with the dead'' [[spell]]s or similar methods. Once used, these rings lost their wicked enchantment.
