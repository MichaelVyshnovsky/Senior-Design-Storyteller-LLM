        "mainbody": "Star Sticks were enchanted items that could illuminate drakes with starlight.\nStar Sticks were small glass tubes, according to the manufacturer, filled with captured starlight.\nThese tubes need to be shaken and snapped to be activated. Once the glass was snapped, it magically returned to its original shape and illuminated the surroundings similarly to the effects of the continual flame spell. Star Sticks were single-use items.\n*Xanda Pennywell a weaver from the hamlet of Liams Hold kept a Star Stick in her business papers-littered desk at home circa 1372 DR."
