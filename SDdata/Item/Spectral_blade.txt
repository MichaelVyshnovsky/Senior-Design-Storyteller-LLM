Spectral blade was an enchanted ghostly freezing cold longsword.
The hilt was crafted out of the bones of a creature that had died a painful and violent death. When inactive, a spectral blade appeared to be nothing but the bone hilt. But once the hilt was touched by a creature, a blade made entirely out of cold light, similar in appearance to faerie fire, came to life.
Spectral blades could be created to resemble other types of weapons such as daggers or greatswords.
The blade of this longsword was intangible and was hard to wield because of its weightlessness. When a target was struck by a spectral blade, it suffered magical damage, similar to the chill touch spell.
In 1369 DR, a spectral blade was in the possession of Marjon, a red half-dragon member of the Cult of the Dragon. He was among the members of the cult who was occupying ruined Myth Drannor in attempts to tap into the power of the pool of radiance.
Spectral blades could be created by a skilled magic arms and armor crafters via use of the chill touch spell.
