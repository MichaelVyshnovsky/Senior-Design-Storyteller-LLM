'''''Spectral blade''''' was an enchanted [[ghost]]ly freezing cold [[longsword]].

==Description==
The hilt was crafted out of the bones of a creature that had died a painful and violent death. When inactive, a ''spectral blade'' appeared to be nothing but the bone hilt. But once the hilt was touched by a creature, a blade made entirely out of cold light, similar in appearance to ''[[faerie fire]]'', came to life.

''Spectral blades'' could be created to resemble other types of weapons such as [[dagger]]s or [[greatsword]]s.

==Powers==
The blade of this longsword was intangible and was hard to wield because of its weightlessness. When a target was struck by a ''spectral blade'', it suffered magical damage, similar to the ''[[chill touch]]'' spell.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], a ''spectral blade'' was in the possession of [[Marjon]], a [[red dragon|red]] [[half-dragon]] member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. He was among the members of the cult who was occupying ruined [[Myth Drannor]] in attempts to tap into the power of the ''[[pool of radiance]]''.

==Creation==
''Spectral blades'' could be created by a skilled magic arms and armor crafters via use of the ''chill touch'' spell.
