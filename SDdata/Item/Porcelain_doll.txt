A porcelain doll was a type of doll crafted from the material known as porcelain.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold porcelain dolls, shaped solely like humans, that were made in the cities of Tilverton and Urmlaspyr. For a time the catalogue also sold dolls that had been made in Westgate, until it received numerous complaints about the poor quality of Westhavian porcelain. Advertised as being perfect for the children of retired adventurers, these dolls came in rich swaddling clothes and were sold for 2 gold pieces each.
* The Toysmiths, a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the gnome brothers Gunder and Relvan Gaewilder, sold porcelain baby dolls. They offered male ones for 2 gold pieces and female ones for 25 silver pieces. Customers were asked to specify what color they wished to have for the eyes and hair of their doll.
* Hezza, a pawnbroker in Lyrabar, carried porcelain dolls in his shop.
* Maniacal Manny, an enchanter living in Procampur, owned a menacing looking porcelain doll of a brown weasel.
* Some male merchants in the Realms collected and traded porcelain dolls in secrecy, as they were liable to face ridicule by their acquaintances or outrage from their wives over how much they spent on such dolls. Some rented out private locales to get together for swap meets, such as at the House of Twilight in Tantras.
