'''Glow water''' was an [[alchemical]] substance made by [[hedge wizard]]s.

==Powers==
Its effects were unspecified, but it may have possibly glowed. They possibly lasted for up to four hours, or perhaps a full day.Its function and appearance are both left unspoken in ''Dragon'' magazine #163, and it appears in only one supplement afterwards, ''Magic Encyclopedia Volume 2'', which documents only its price. The ''Dragon'' article suggests that most of the effects of the alchemical substances listed in it last for up to four hours, and that the DM should be the one that determines the effect of some of the substances left undescribed. Given the glow water's only clue to its function was its name and that it was considered sufficient in the introducing ''Dragon'' article, this article assumes the most likely effect of glow water is that it glowed.

==History==
The substance was very challenging to synthesize,{{Cite dragon/163/Hedge Wizards|21}} It sold for about 200 [[gold pieces]].
