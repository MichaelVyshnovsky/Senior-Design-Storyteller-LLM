Dust of dryness was a strong magical absorbent of water.
As the name suggested, dust of dryness came in the form of dust. As mentioned above, it worked like an absorbent for water. Once it absorbed water, the dust solidified into the form of a pellet that was around the size of a marble.
When a dose of dust of dryness was thrown into water, it absorbed up to 100 gallons (455 liters) and solidified into a pellet where it was thrown into. The process was instantaneous. Only water, no matter its pH-value, could be absorbed by an application of dust of dryness.
When the pellet was thrown on the ground, it broke and released all the absorbed water at once.
Dust of dryness was dangerous for all kinds of elementals that had water as part of its being. The dust could kill or at least hurt them on touching it. It could be weaponized against such creatures by actively throwing the dust against them.
Creating a dose of dust dryness required someone to cast control water.
One of the most fearsome spells ever developed on Faer√ªn, the horrendous dessication spell, required a dose of dust of dryness as its material component.
