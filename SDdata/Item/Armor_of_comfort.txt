'''''Armors of comfort''''' were [[enchanted]] sets of [[heavy armor]] that were masterfully crafted to be soft and comfortable on the inside.

==Description==
''Armors of comfort'' were constructed of interlocking [[iron]] plates, [[greaves]], and [[gauntlet]]s, seemingly heavy and unwieldy. However, once the armor was put on, it felt light and comfortable, as if nothing more than a soft [[tunic]]. These sets of amore were even magically scented with [[lavender]] to hide the wielder's bodily odors.

==Powers==
''Armors of comfort'' possessed potent ''+2'' protective enchantments and boosted the wearer's healing, both skills and [[spell]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Neurik]] of [[Port Llast]]'s temple of [[Tyr]] offered a set of ''armor of comfort'' for sale.
