'''Red Rum Swirl''' was a pleasant comfort alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], such as [[the Hidden Lady]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-18 - Red rum swirl}}

==Description==
Red Rum Swirl was a nutty, pleasant, and gentle softly colored red drink. Its hue was due to the sparing use of [[cherry brandy]]. The rest of the ingredients used in the mixed drink included a base of [[rum]] mixed with an abundant amount of [[almond brandy]] and stirred-in [[caramel]], made out of cream and sugar.

The gentle sweetness of the drink made it easy to drink too much, oftentimes leaving imbibers extremely maudlin and intoxicated.
