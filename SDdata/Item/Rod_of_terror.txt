'''''Rods of terror''''' were enchanted [[rod]]s that emitted the aura of evil, fear, and unease.

==Powers==
These rods were palpably evil even when inactive. When they were activated, ''rods of terror'' projected forward a wave of unspeakable terror on a target. This foul magic was able to affect even the most brave and unshakable heroes with the feeling of gravely dread. A fully-functional rod held fifty charges and allowed the wielder to cast ''[[fear]]'' (three charges per use) and ''[[scare]]'' (a single charge) spells.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these rods could be found throughout the [[Sword Coast]] region, notably in the cities of [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]]'s [[Sorceller's Encapsulate]].
