        "mainbody": "'''Omlar gems''' were exceptionally rare gems mined from the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] in [[Tethyr]].<ref name=FRCS-p157/>",
        "Description": "Omlars were rock crystals with about the same hardness and color as [[aquamarine]]s and could also be mistaken for [[emerald]]s of a lighter shade.<ref name=LoI1:T-p55>",
        "Powers": "Omlar gems had the ability to easily absorb enchantments, which made them a coveted component of many a [[wizard]]'s powerful magical items.<ref name=LoI1:T-p55/>",
        "Source": "These gems were only found deep in the hills and mountains of the Omlarandins and were so rare even there that only a few were found every hundred years.<ref name=LoI1:T-p55/>",
        "Reputation": "Because of their rarity and powers, omlar gems fetched sums of money worthy of princes<ref name=FRCS-p157/> and were sought out by wizards in [[Duhlnarim]], [[Llorbauth]], [[Saradush]], and [[Zazesspur]].<ref name=LoI1:T-p55/>",
        "Notable uses": "Omlar gems were used in the construction of the minarets lining the [[Trade Way]] in the [[Calim Desert]] from [[Calimport]] to [[Memnon]] during the [[Shoon Imperium]]. These minarets were erected in pairs, one on each side of the road. On the rooftop parapets of each of these 40-ft-high (12 m) towers, a fist-sized omlar gem was placed above a brass brazier. When the braziers were lit, the omlar gems glowed a brilliant blue and together created a magical field that protected the Trade Way out to 1,500 yd (1,370 m). This magical field defended against wind, sand, and glare and also against the effects of [[Calim|Calim's breath]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon's crackle]] and against [[purple worm]]s.<ref name=EotSS-pp80-81>\n\nAfter the fall of the Shoon Empire, the Trade Way and its minarets fell into disuse and decay. More than a third of the omlar crystals were pried out of their settings and stolen, to be sold for exorbitant prices in Calimport and Memnon.<ref name=EotSS-pp80-81/>\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Syl-pasha [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] was actively seeking for wizards to help him restore the minarets and thus the financially beneficial traffic on the Trade Way. By three-quarters of the way through the year, only the first pair of minarets had been restored.<ref name=EotSS-pp80-81/>",
