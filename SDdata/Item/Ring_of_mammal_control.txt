A ring of mammal control was a magic item that allowed the wearer to control mammals.
The wearer of this ring had complete control over mammals possessing semi-intelligence or lower. This control was so strong that the mammal could even be commanded to kill itself. Control was maintained as long as the wearer concentrated.
Minak al-Zafyi, a shopkeeper in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz, wore a ring of mammal control.
