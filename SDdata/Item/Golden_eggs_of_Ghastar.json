        "mainbody": "he golden eggs of Ghastar were a collection of powerful magical items created in Tabot in ancient times.\nThey were nine golden eggs, each of them unique and not all of them gold. They took the form of eggs, of course, adorned with animals or inlays and fashioned from precious metals, stones, and gems.\nEach egg had its own distinct magical power, usable only by a monk or shukenja of lawful nature and moderate to high ability. The powers of the extant eggs were as follows\n* The gold egg with ruby snakes could stop avalanches and floods,\n* The obsidian egg with silver crocodiles could create earthquakes (like the earthquake spell),\n* The gold egg supported by jade elephants could control peoples minds (as with mass charm), and\n* The silver egg with emerald inlays resembling lace could trigger a volcanic eruption.\nThe five lost eggs were thought to be equally powerful, but the information was lost to history.\nThe nine golden eggs were crafted by artisans of ancient Tabot, long before the coming of the lamas in . Even their original name seems to have been lostâ€”Ghastar was only the last man known to have possessed all nine.\nOver the centuries, however, the eggs became scattered and five of them were lost. By , the four remaining eggs were held by the lamas at Pokarr Gompa. When Rokstang was inundated by a great flood in , the Abbot of Pokarr, Mo Kin, used the ruby-snake egg to stop the flood and save the city.\n* Ghastar, the last to own all nine golden eggs and for whom they were later named.\n* The lamas of Pokarr Gompa, who kept the remaining four in its treasure rooms around ."
