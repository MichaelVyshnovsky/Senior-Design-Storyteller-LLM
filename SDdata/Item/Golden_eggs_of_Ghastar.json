        "mainbody": "The '''''golden eggs of Ghastar''''' were a collection of powerful [[magical item]]s created in [[Tabot]] in ancient times.",
        "Description": "They were nine ''golden eggs'', each of them unique and not all of them [[gold]]. They took the form of eggs, of course, adorned with animals or inlays and fashioned from precious metals, stones, and [[gem]]s.",
        "Powers": "Each egg had its own distinct magical power, usable only by a [[monk]] or [[shukenja]] of [[lawful]] nature and moderate to high ability. The powers of the extant eggs were as follows:\n* The gold egg with [[ruby]] [[snake]]s could stop avalanches and floods,\n* The [[obsidian]] egg with [[silver]] [[crocodile]]s could create earthquakes (like the ''[[earthquake]]'' spell),\n* The gold egg supported by [[jade]] [[elephant]]s could control people's minds (as with ''[[mass charm]]''), and\n* The silver egg with [[emerald]] inlays resembling lace could trigger a volcanic eruption.\nThe five lost eggs were thought to be equally powerful, but the information was lost to history.",
        "History": "The nine ''golden eggs'' were crafted by artisans of ancient Tabot, long before the coming of the lamas in {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}}.<ref> Even their original name seems to have been lostâ€”Ghastar was only the last man known to have possessed all nine.\n\nOver the centuries, however, the eggs became scattered and five of them were lost. By {{YearlinkConvert|2600|SY}}, the four remaining eggs were held by the lamas at [[Pokarr Gompa]]. When [[Rokstang]] was inundated by a great flood in {{YearlinkConvert|2601|SY}}, the Abbot of Pokarr, [[Mo Kin]], used the ruby-snake egg to stop the flood and save the city.<ref>",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Ghastar]], the last to own all nine ''golden eggs'' and for whom they were later named.\n* The lamas of [[Pokarr Gompa]], who kept the remaining four in its treasure rooms around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}."
