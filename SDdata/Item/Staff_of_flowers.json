        "mainbody": "A staff of flowers was a magical staff that caused flowers to grow.\nWhen pointed at earth or soil, it caused a regular, non-magical flower to sprout. The wielder was able to choose which flower would grow, but if they didnt, the staff, by default, created a daisy. The staff held ten charges, and each time the staff was used to create a flower, a charge was expended. The staff recharged itself daily at dawn. When the last charge was used, there was a chance the staff would turn into a bunch of flower petals.\nA staff of flowers was a part of a set that, when used together, boosted the magics of all items in the set the staff, the Woven Vine, and the Blooming Cord.\nThe eccentric druid Wyllow had a staff of flowers, which she kept on the second floor of her tower, Wyllows Tower, located in Wyllowwood, the fifth level of Undermountain."
