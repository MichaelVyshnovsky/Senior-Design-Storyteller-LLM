'''Rhodochrosite''', also known as '''rosenstone''', was most often used in rings and pendants.

==Description==
These [[ornamental stones]] were various shades of pink and translucent with a glassy sheen. They could be tumbled and polished for jewelry. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

Rodochrosite stones were considered sacred by followers of [[Lliira]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12}}

==Powers==
A quantity of rosenstone about the size of an eyeball could be crushed into a powder and brewed with a special tea. A being that had been poisoned or diseased could consume a pot of this tea for a chance at a ''[[neutralize poison]]'' or ''[[cure disease]]'' effect.
