Rhodochrosite, also known as rosenstone, was most often used in rings and pendants.
These ornamental stones were various shades of pink and translucent with a glassy sheen. They could be tumbled and polished for jewelry. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.
Rodochrosite stones were considered sacred by followers of Lliira&mdashappropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.
A quantity of rosenstone about the size of an eyeball could be crushed into a powder and brewed with a special tea. A being that had been poisoned or diseased could consume a pot of this tea for a chance at a neutralize poison or cure disease effect.
