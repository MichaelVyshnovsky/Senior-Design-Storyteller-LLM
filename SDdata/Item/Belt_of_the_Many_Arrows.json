        "mainbody": "A belt of the Many Arrows was a distinctive enchanted belt awarded to the fiercest warriors among the Many-Arrows orcs.\nThe belts were decorated with the traditional totems of the Many-Arrows tribe, and served as markers of power and status. Some belts were customized by their wearer.\nThese belts enhanced their wearers durability in battle.\nDuring the mid-to-late 15 century DR, orcs who had earned the honor to wear these belts were known to lead warbands in the ruined Tower District of Neverwinter. This included the Many-Arrows vicious taskmasters, who whipped lower ranking orcs into frenzies before sending them at the Neverwinter Guard.\nKragmar Deepscar wore a unique Belt of the Many Arrows while he led an orc warband in Neverwinter."
