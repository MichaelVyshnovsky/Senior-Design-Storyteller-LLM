Wands of glitterdust were magic wands that were useful when dealing with invisible threats.
The wand of glitterdust found in the Resurrection Gorge in Amn appeared to be a smooth piece of wood with air around it glittering in a strange light.
Wands of glitterdust possessed a number of charges of the glitterdust spells, discharged at the wielders command. The spell could remove invisibility from creatures and objects affected by the spells and blind creatures for a short period of time.
One wand of glitterdust was found in a crystal growth at the roots of a great oak tree at the center of the Resurrection Gorge. The wand may have been used against an invisible tanarri Xachrimos who was bound to the Gorge.
