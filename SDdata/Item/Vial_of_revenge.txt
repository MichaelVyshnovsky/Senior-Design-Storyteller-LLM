'''''Vial of revenge''''' was a [[potion]] invented by the [[rashemi]] [[wizard]] [[Shevarith Kendia]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The potion was ingested prior to battle. If the imbiber were ever slain, it would trigger an [[arcane]] [[curse]] that inflicted the imbiber's full magical strength against all of their enemies at once.

==History==
Shevarith had travelled to Waterdeep to earn the respect of the [[Blackstaff]], [[Vajra Safahr]], and was driven to pursue [[magical]] excellence at all costs. She devised the ''vial of revenge'' to make sure that no one would ever best her in combat without paying a price.

==Notable Owners==
* Shevarith Kendia, a rashemi wizard who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
