        "mainbody": "Cubic gates were legendary magical devices of planar travel, allowing users to create gates to a set of five different planes of existence and the Prime Material.\nAs their name implied, cubic gates were small cubes. They measured roughly  across, were fashioned from carnelian, and radiated a palpable dweomer.\nEach side of a cubic gate was keyed to a specific plane, though one of the six would always be keyed to the Prime Material plane. The selection of planes each side was keyed to would be purposely selected during a cubic gates creation. When a side of a cube was pressed upon once, a gate would open to a random point on its keyed plane, whilst pressing upon it a second time would then close the gate. There could never be more than one gate opened at a time and, much like the gate spell, the gates a cubic gate created were two-way and thus always had a small chance of something coming through from their other side.\nPressing a side of a cubic gate twice in quick succession would instead cause an effect similar to the plane shift spell, opening a gate that forcefully pulled in the side-presser and all other creatures within a  radius.\nFollowing the Second Sundering, cubic gates could only be activated three times per day.\nThe Cube of Location a.k.a. Transforming cubic gate A cubic gate that was modified by Damien Nuren. It was keyed solely to the Shadow Plane and was also designed to transform nearby creatures into either a shade or shadow, but while the gate opened, the transformation function failed to work when tested.\n* These were among the magical items commonly used by planewalkers and could be purchased in the markets of Sigil at prices lower than those on the Prime Material.\n* Ahghairon, a powerful mage of Waterdeep, owned a cubic gate. His was created by the wizard Hilather and covered on each of its sides in Alzhedo characters. In addition to the Prime Material plane, the cubic gates sides were keyed to Arborea, the Elemental Plane of Fire, the Far Realm, the Nine Hells, and the Outlands.\n* On the Isle of Evermeet, the fourth floor display room housed a cubic gate that was considered to be an antique by the 14 century DR.\n* Mordeia the Great, a famed planewalker.\nAround 1368 DR, a gelatinous cube in the Maddgoths Castle level of Undermountain had a cubic gate within it from one of the victims of a gorgon.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers traveling to the city of Ravens Bluff were attacked by a group of bandits led by the wizard Astrid. Among their ill-gotten loot the adventurers found a cursed cubic gate that instantly transported them to the Elemental Plane of Air and eventually the Negative Material Plane. There the planewalker Rowan Darkwood rescued the adventurers with a word of recall from death by negative energy, taking them to the Astral Plane. Rowan quickly surmised that their cubic gate was cursed and that the adventurers would have to meet a certain requirement at each of its keyed planes if they wanted to get back home. He beseeched his patron deity Heimdall for guidance on the matter, but received only riddles as to how they had to progress.\nAfter treating the adventurers to a heroes feast, Rowan let them on their way. They proceeded to be taken by the cubic gate to the planes of Baator, Bytopia, Ysgard,An exact name for the Prime Material world visited in Plane Speaking is never given, but everything shown about the world indicates it is most likely Athas, such as the prevalence of psionics, sorcerer-kings in power, a scarcity of metal, a mention of preservers, and the appearance of creatures from the Dark Sun setting."
