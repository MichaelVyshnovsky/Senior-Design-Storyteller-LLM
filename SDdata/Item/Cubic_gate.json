        "mainbody": "'''''Cubic gates''''' were legendary magical devices of planar travel, allowing users to create [[portal|gate]]s to a set of five different [[planes of existence]] and the [[Prime Material]].",
        "Description": "As their name implied, ''cubic gates'' were small cubes. They measured roughly {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} across, were fashioned from [[carnelian]], and radiated a palpable [[dweomer]].",
        "Powers": "Each side of a ''cubic gate'' was keyed to a specific plane, though one of the six would always be keyed to the Prime Material plane. The selection of planes each side was keyed to would be purposely selected during a ''cubic gate's'' creation. When a side of a cube was pressed upon once, a gate would open to a random point on its keyed plane, whilst pressing upon it a second time would then close the gate. There could never be more than one gate opened at a time and, much like the ''[[gate]]'' [[spell]], the gates a ''cubic gate'' created were two-way and thus always had a small chance of something coming through from their other side.\n\nPressing a side of a ''cubic gate'' twice in quick succession would instead cause an effect similar to the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell, opening a gate that forcefully pulled in the side-presser and all other creatures within a {{SIAdj|5|ft|long=yes}} radius.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], ''cubic gates'' could only be activated three times per day.",
        "Variants": {
            "''The Cube of Location a.k.a. Transforming cubic gate''": "A ''cubic gate'' that was modified by [[Damien Nuren]]. It was keyed solely to the [[Shadow Plane]] and was also designed to transform nearby creatures into either a [[shade]] or [[shadow]], but while the gate opened, the transformation function failed to work when tested.<ref>"
        },
        "Notable Owners": "* These were among the magical items commonly used by [[planewalker]]s and could be purchased in the markets of [[Sigil]] at prices lower than those on the Prime Material.\n* [[Ahghairon]], a powerful mage of [[Waterdeep]], owned a ''cubic gate''.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Tower of Ahghairon|4,10}} His was created by the wizard [[Hilather]] and covered on each of its sides in [[Alzhedo]] characters. In addition to the Prime Material plane, the ''cubic gate's'' sides were keyed to [[Arborea]], the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], the [[Far Realm]], the [[Nine Hells]], and the [[Outlands]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Tower of Ahghairon|13,18}}\n* On the Isle of [[Evermeet]], the fourth floor display room housed a ''cubic gate'' that was considered to be an antique by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>\n* Mordeia the Great, a famed planewalker.<ref>",
        "History": "Around [[1368 DR]],<ref> a [[gelatinous cube]] in the [[Maddgoth's Castle]] level of [[Undermountain]] had a ''cubic gate'' within it from one of the victims of a [[gorgon]].<ref>\n\nSometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s traveling to the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] were attacked by a group of bandits led by the [[wizard]] [[Astrid]]. Among their ill-gotten loot the adventurers found a [[curse]]d ''cubic gate'' that instantly transported them to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] and eventually the [[Negative Material Plane]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Plane Speaking|2,4,8}} There the planewalker [[Rowan Darkwood]] rescued the adventurers with a ''[[word of recall]]'' from death by [[negative energy]], taking them to the [[Astral Plane]]. Rowan quickly surmised that their ''cubic gate'' was cursed and that the adventurers would have to meet a certain requirement at each of its keyed planes if they wanted to get back home. He beseeched his patron [[deity]] [[Heimdall]] for guidance on the matter, but received only riddles as to how they had to progress.{{Cite organized play/LC/Plane Speaking|8-9}}\n\nAfter treating the adventurers to a ''[[heroes' feast]]'', Rowan let them on their way. They proceeded to be taken by the ''cubic gate'' to the planes of [[Baator]], [[Bytopia]], [[Ysgard]],An exact name for the Prime Material world visited in ''Plane Speaking'' is never given, but everything shown about the world indicates it is most likely Athas, such as the prevalence of [[psionic]]s, sorcerer-kings in power, a scarcity of metal, a mention of [[w:c:darksun:preserver|preservers]], and the appearance of creatures from the Dark Sun setting."
