'''Beregost Blue''' was a type of [[cheese]] produced in the town of [[Beregost]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
This cheese had distinct tangy taste and blue streaks that crossed the cheese's body. If left to spoil, the blue streaks turned into green mold.

==History==
Even though Beregost Blue was produced only in Beregost, passing merchants helped to export it all across the [[Sword Coast]]. Monks of [[Candlekeep]] were among the most loyal buyers of Beregost Blue, purchasing countless wheels over the years.
