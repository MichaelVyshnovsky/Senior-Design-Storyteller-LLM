Beregost Blue was a type of cheese produced in the town of Beregost in the Western Heartlands as of the late 15 century DR.
This cheese had distinct tangy taste and blue streaks that crossed the cheeses body. If left to spoil, the blue streaks turned into green mold.
Even though Beregost Blue was produced only in Beregost, passing merchants helped to export it all across the Sword Coast. Monks of Candlekeep were among the most loyal buyers of Beregost Blue, purchasing countless wheels over the years.
