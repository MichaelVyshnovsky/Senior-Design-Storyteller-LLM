Kossuths belts of priestly might and warding were enchanted Kossuthan and Mystran items that protects the members of the gods clergy.
These wide and decorated belts were inscribe with the holy symbols of either Kossuth or Mystra.
These magic items were imbued with +2 enchantments to the wearers defenses and increased their physical strength. Once per day, belts of priestly might and warding allowed the wearer to cast the magic circle against alignment spell. Due to the devine nature of these items, both gods of magic, Kossuth and Mystra, only allowed creatures not swayed by good nor evil to wear these belts.
Kossuths belts of priestly might and warding first appeared shortly after the Time of Troubles in the country of Halruaa. The wizards of Halruaa took this as an arcane miraculous evidence of Mystras return and restoration of the weave that was burning wild during the time gods walked on Toril. By the late 14 century DR, several of similar belts, inscribed with holy symbols of both Mystra and Kossuth could be found across the Sword Coast as well as the Moonsea region. One such Kossuthan item was among possessions of the worshipers of Gond in the Purple Portals of Melvaunt.
