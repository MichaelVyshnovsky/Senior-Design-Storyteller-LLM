'''''Kossuth's belts of priestly might and warding''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Kossuth]]an and [[Mystra]]n items that protects the members of the gods' clergy.

==Description==
These wide and decorated [[belt]]s were inscribe with the [[holy symbol]]s of either Kossuth or Mystra.

==Powers==
These magic items were imbued with ''+2'' enchantments to the wearers' defenses and increased their physical strength. Once per day, ''belts of priestly might and warding'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[magic circle against alignment]]'' spell. Due to the devine nature of these items, both gods of magic, Kossuth and Mystra, only allowed creatures not swayed by good nor evil to wear these belts.

==History==
''Kossuth's belts of priestly might and warding'' first appeared shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]] in the country of [[Halruaa]]. The [[wizard]]s of Halruaa took this as an arcane miraculous evidence of [[Mystra]]'s return and restoration of the [[weave]] that was burning wild during the time gods walked on [[Toril]]. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of similar belts, inscribed with holy symbols of both Mystra and Kossuth could be found across the [[Sword Coast]] as well as the [[Moonsea]] region. One such Kossuthan item was among possessions of the worshipers of [[Gond]] in the [[Purple Portals]] of [[Melvaunt]].
