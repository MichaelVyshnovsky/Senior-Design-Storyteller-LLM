        "mainbody": "Shields of fortitude were huge enchanted shields of dull gray steel, forged and ensorcelled by the duergar dwarves underneath the Spine of the World.\nThose who held such shields felt pulsating rejuvenation magic that ran through the item and into the wielder. This steeling magic aided them in battle, as did the shields size and sturdiness.\nIn , one such steel shield belonged to Barud Barzam, a duergar leader who was in charge of an underground outpost in the River Caves, where the Black Raven River spills from under the Spine of the World. Barud offered his shield of fortitude to anyone willing to descend into the lower caverns underneath the outpost to exterminate hook horrors and mustard jellies who infested the area."
