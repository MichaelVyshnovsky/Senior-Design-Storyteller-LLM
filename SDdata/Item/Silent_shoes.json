        "mainbody": "Silent shoes were special footwear used by some rogues.\nCreaking shoes were a thieves nightmare. Silent shoes were soled with a rare flexible material found deep within the jungles of Chult. This substance eliminates any sound created by old leather from typical shoes or boots. These shoes were useful for minimizing noise when travelling within cities as well as natural habitats.\nA pair of silent shoes cost 10 gold."
