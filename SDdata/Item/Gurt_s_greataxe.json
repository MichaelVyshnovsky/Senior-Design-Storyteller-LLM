        "History": "The axe was first wielded by [[Gurt]], the Lord of the Pale Giants, who fought against the expanding [[human]] population of the north during the 2{{nd}} century [[DR]]. In the [[123 DR|Year of the Icy Axe, 123 DR]], Gurt fell in battle to the leader of the barbarians, [[Uthgar Gardolfsson]], in a famous battle that marked the ascendancy of humans within the greater [[Dessarin Valley]]. Following the battle, ''Gurt's greataxe'' was buried within [[Morgur's Mound]], where it remained for over 700 years.\n\nDuring the [[Second Trollwar]], ''Gurt's greataxe'' was recovered and taken back to the city of [[Waterdeep]] by [[Amphail Caradoon|Amphail the Just]]. The axe was still in Harshnag's possession as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Reputation": "The axe was immediately recognizable by all [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s, who promptly attacked its wielder on sight."
