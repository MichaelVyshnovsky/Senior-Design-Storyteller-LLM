'''Marionettes''' were a variety of [[puppet]] that could be found in both the Realms and [[Barovia]], that differed from others in that they were controlled by strings.
{{quote|Who is this maestro, this puppet master, pulling the strings of so many marionettes?|[[Drizzt Do'Urden]]}}

==Availability==
* In the Domain of Barovia, the toysmith [[Gadof Blinsky]] of [[Vallaki]] sold a wide variety of marionettes, modeled after jesters,<ref> kings and queens, princes and princesses, executioners, tax collectors, dunces, [[vampire]]s, and vampire hunters.<ref>

==Notable Marionettes==
* [[Carrionette]]s, a variety of malicious [[construct]]s, were sometimes created from marionettes.

==History==
On [[Toril]], marionettes could be found as far back as the [[Netheril|Empire of Netheril]], where those skilled in using them could be found as members of the [[League of Noted Singers and Performers]]. A notable puppeteer of marionettes during this time was the [[archwizard]] [[Halavar]], who created a [[magical item]] with engravings of marionettes that allowed him to effortlessly reproduce the ones he owned.

In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], one could make special orders for marionettes from the [[Stringpullers guild]] of [[Saerloon]].

During this same time, [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold a wide variety of marionettes, which they marketed as a tool for [[bard]]s. The marionettes that they sold resembled variously bards, crones, cutpurses, farmers, herdsmen, kings and queens, [[mage]]s, maidens, merchants, mothers, noblemen, [[orc]]s, peasants, [[priest]]s, princes and princesses, [[skeleton]]s, slaves, and soldiers. They also sold [[dragon]] marionettes, made of [[silk]] from [[Shou Lung]], that required three hands to operate. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, these dragon marionettes were also produced in the [[Faerûn]]ian state of [[Nathlan]].

When the [[warmage]] [[Aoth Fezim]] was affected by the [[Spellplague]], he saw an illusory image of [[Bareris Anskuld]] dangling a marionette that resembled himself, twitching its strings to make it dance.
