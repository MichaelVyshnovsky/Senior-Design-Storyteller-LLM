Exeltis Ice Wine was a rare type of red wine pressed and bottled by the Exeltis family in their keep in the Blade Cliffs of the Sword Coast.
Exeltis Ice Wine was considered one of the best wines in the Realms. The ice wine was fermented using the juice of small grey grapes that were cultivated along the Blade Cliffs, the lands that surrounded Castle Exeltis.
The wine was aged in enormous wooden kegs in the castles basements before being bottled in fanciful bottles of blueish and purple glass.
The original recipe for Exeltis Ice Wine was developed by Cedric Exeltis. The Exeltis family continued production of the fine red wine for several generations that followed. By 1372 DR, the Exeltis clan and their wine business were in decline. Due to its quality, reputation, and rarity, Exeltis Ice Wine was considered an extremely rare and valuable vintage.
