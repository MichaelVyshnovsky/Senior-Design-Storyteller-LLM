        "mainbody": "'''''Robes of the Shining Hand''''' were enchanted [[robe]]s created by the [[monk]]s of the [[Shining Hand]] monastic order. Originating in [[Vaasa]] they were in high demand across many nations ''circa'' late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Robes of the Shining Hand'' possessed a powerful enchantment that increased a monk's reflexes and senses to such degree, they could easily shift their body absorbing even most powerful blows, dramatically increasing the wearer's defense. These robes did have a negative effect, they wearer became extremely sensitive to sounds, making it hard to differentiate between a sound of snoring and a sound of a scattering [[mouse]].",
        "History": "The order of the [[Shining Hand]] originated in [[Amn]] and encouraged the use of arcane magic, allowing [[wizards]] to join alongside monks. Fleeing Amn's persecution of spellcasters, some settled in [[Vaasa]] creating the Shining Hand Monastery there. That branch of the order gained reputation and fortune by creating the ''Robes of the Shining Hand'' that became a valuable commodity in many regions across the Realms. In late 14{{th}} century, the monastery was hard at work creating variations on the enchanted robes that could be found in many places and traders' inventories of the [[Sword Coast]]."
