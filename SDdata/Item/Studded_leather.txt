'''Studded leather armor''' was a type of armor used on [[Toril]].

==Description==
Studded leather armor was made from tough yet flexible leather (unlike [[leather armor]], it was not hardened). It was reinforced with numerous close-set rivets or spikes. Studded leather provided slightly more protection than regular leather armor. Each set was fitted with hundreds of rivets. It tended to rot and fall apart faster than most other sorts of armors in the Realms. Because of this it was quite common to find repaired, secondhand sets.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/Armor, Clothes, and Awful Jobs}}

==Variations==
;Spiked leather: Studded leather with sharp spikes mounted upon its rivets. Typically seen in use by gladiators, [[barbarian]]s of [[the North]], some [[hill giant]]s, and [[battlerager]]s.
