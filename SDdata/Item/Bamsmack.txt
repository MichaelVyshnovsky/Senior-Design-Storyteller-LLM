Bamsmacks were diversion tools used by some rogues.
Imported from exotic Shou Lung, bamsmacks were made from bamboo reed and stuffed with salt. Once lit, a bamsmack would explode several moments later with a loud popping sound, offering a diversion for crafty thieves.
Tricking a guard with a bamsmack usually only worked one time.
A single bamsmack cost 5 gold pieces.
