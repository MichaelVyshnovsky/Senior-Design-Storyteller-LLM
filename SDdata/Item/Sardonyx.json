        "Powers": "Sardonyx had many uses in the magical Art. It was used as a spell component and in creating magic items which affected wisdom. It was reported to have the same properties as the much rarer [[king's tears]] except that it was not indestructible. And it was one of the \"nine secrets\" (gemstones that could become ''[[ioun stones]]'' if enchanted properly). Wearing or carrying sardonyx could also absorb a minimal amount of damage from a ''[[magic missile]]'', but this was a random occurrence and thus not very reliable."
