A '''grindstone''' was a simple mechanical device used to polish and sharpen metal items.

|A [[giant]] with a [[butterknife]] can at times be less deadly than a [[halfling]] with a [[razor]]. All smiths know the importance of a good grindstone.

==Usage==
A typical grindstone could be hand-powered, or pedal-powered to ensure easy operation and a steady rate of rotation.

A smaller table-top version called the '''grinding wheel''' was used by jewelers to polish and finish [[gem]]s and delicate pieces of metalwork.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a 20 [[gp]] foot-powered grindstone for sharpening metal blades.
