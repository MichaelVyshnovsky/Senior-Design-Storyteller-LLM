        "mainbody": "'''''Viconia's priestess robe''''' was a powerfully [[enchanted]] [[Sharran]] [[robe]] worn by Mother Superior [[Viconia DeVir]] of the [[Cloister of Sombre Embrace]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Viconia's robes were black like [[Shar]]'s heart but decorated with silver metallic motifs, including a stylized shape of a [[spider]] on her open décolleté and dark golden patterns on the fabric.",
        "Powers": "The robes hummed with dark enchantments that dulled the senses, thoughts, and feelings of those around them. If one listened to the hum for a prolonged period of time, one could almost hear the chittering of a thousand spiders being devoured by a hungry darkness. It possessed a ''+1'' protective enchantment, and ''Shar's umbrae'' magic wrapped the wearer in darkness, making it easier for them to dissolve into the shadows. It also possessed a permanent ''Sharran veil'' enchantment that functioned similarly to the ''[[shield of faith]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "Viconia DeVir came to possess her unique robes sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when she was always seen wearing the Sharran garb whilst surrounded by the faithful of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace."
