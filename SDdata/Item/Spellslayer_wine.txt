'''Spellslayer wine''' was an alchemical concoction that temporarily disabled [[arcane magic|arcane casters]]' ability to use [[magic]].{{Cite dungeon/195/Eye on the Realms: Spellslayer Wine}}

==History==
It was discovered by a herbalist in [[Daerlun]] named [[Janesse Wyndsur]]. The potion was discovered accidentally by Janesse while she was experimenting with painkilling potions. The potion was made from [[wyvern]] blood, [[oak]] sap, [[harpy]] blood, and the [[herb]]s [[alarvaun]], [[drace]], and [[thelmallow]] flowers. Janesse began selling the potion in [[1476 DR]].

==Description==
The potion was described as a thick, clear syrup.

==Effects==
[[Mage]]s ingesting an undiluted dose of the potion were unable to cast [[spell]]s for up to eight hours, although the duration of the effect varied. The potion took effect within several minutes. Some merchants sold diluted potions whose effects wore off sooner.

==Known Victims==
Spellslayer wine was implicated in the deaths of
* [[Deirorn]] of [[Selgaunt]]
* [[Haskran]] of [[Procampur]]
* [[Izntal]] of [[Calimport]]
* [[Narth Laroun]] of [[Zazesspur]]
