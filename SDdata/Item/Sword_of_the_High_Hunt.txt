Swords of the High Hunt were enchanted longswords wielded by the Malarite worshipers during the High Hunt.
These blades possessed +1 enchantments and were ensorcelled to deal additional magical damage when wielded against humans. Additionally, the swords enchantments fortified the wielders ability to intimidate others.
The worshipers of the Beastlord used these swords during one of the holy festivals of the Malarite faith the High Hunt. During the event, a humanoid was released into the wilds and relentlessly pursued by Malarites. Swords of the High Hunt were used to intimidate terrified victims further and torture them with pain specifically enchanted to affect humans. One such sword was among the possession of dark druids—worshipers of Malar—who made a lair in the Wild Hills of the Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.
