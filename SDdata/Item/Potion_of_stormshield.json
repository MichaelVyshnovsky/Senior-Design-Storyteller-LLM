        "mainbody": "+\nPotions of stormshield were a sort of damage resistance potion that existed in the period between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering.\nThe liquid within these potions had a slate gray hue and a smell evocative of ozone.\nIngestion of a potion of stormshield temporarily gave the imbibers skin a metallic sheen and made them resistant to the next instance of lightning and thunder damage that afflicted them.\nIn the late 15 century DR, potions of stormshield could be found in use by many members of the Zhentarim."
