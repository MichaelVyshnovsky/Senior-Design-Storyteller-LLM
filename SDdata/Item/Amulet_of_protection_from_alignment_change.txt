An amulet of protection from alignment change was an enchanted amulet that shielded the wearer from any magic designed to alter their core beliefs.
A ruby stood as the centerpiece fror this talisman.
This amulet would function normally against items of weaker power, but against artifacts of great power it would only serve to slow down the alignment altering effects.
