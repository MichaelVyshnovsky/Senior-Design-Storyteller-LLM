Magillas stone missile necklace was an enchanted jewelry that contained magics similar to those of magic missiles, crafted by Magilla, an aged saru shaman of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
This magic necklace was assembled on a leather cord out of ten dark red stones.
Each necklaces stones were enchanted to deal magic damage when taken off the cord and thrown at the enemy. When thrown, a stone turned into a magic missile, never missing.
In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, the saru village, Magillas home, fell under a wasting curse placed on it by a vain earth spirit of the Living Jungle named Ligela. The spirit was quelled by a group of adventuring tribesfolk, saving the lives of suffering saru. Magilla enchanted several items as a gift for the saviors. Magillas stone missile necklace was among the magic items created by the shaman.
