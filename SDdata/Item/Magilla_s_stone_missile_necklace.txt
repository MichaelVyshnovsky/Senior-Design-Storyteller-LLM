'''''Magilla's stone missile necklace''''' was an [[enchanted]] jewelry that contained magics similar to those of ''[[magic missile]]s'', crafted by [[Magilla]], an aged [[saru]] [[shaman]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
This magic necklace was assembled on a [[leather]] cord out of ten dark red stones.

==Powers==
Each necklace's stones were enchanted to deal magic damage when taken off the cord and thrown at the enemy. When thrown, a stone turned into a ''magic missile'', never missing.

==History==
In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, the saru village, Magilla's home, fell under a wasting curse placed on it by a vain [[earth spirit]] of the Living Jungle named [[Ligela]]. The spirit was quelled by a group of adventuring tribesfolk, saving the lives of suffering saru. Magilla enchanted several items as a gift for the saviors. ''Magilla's stone missile necklace'' was among the magic items created by the shaman.
