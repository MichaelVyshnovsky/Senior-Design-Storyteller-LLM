A derivation cloak was an enchanted cloak that radiated a healing aura if the wearer used poison against their foes.
The cloaks deadly derivation enchantment healed the wearer every time they dealt poison damage or simply poisoned a creature.
Sometime before the , the derivation cloak was created by a crazed alchemist who was attempting to find a way to sap youth from his victims through poisoning. The first attempts were done via magical formulae but the cloak proved to be much more reliable.
