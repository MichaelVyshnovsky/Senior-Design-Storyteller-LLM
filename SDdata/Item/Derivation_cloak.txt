A '''''derivation cloak''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] that radiated a healing aura if the wearer used [[poison]] against their foes.

==Powers==
The cloak's ''deadly derivation'' enchantment healed the wearer every time they dealt poison damage or simply poisoned a creature.

==History==
Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''derivation cloak'' was created by a crazed [[alchemist]] who was attempting to find a way to sap youth from his victims through poisoning. The first attempts were done via magical formulae but the cloak proved to be much more reliable. With time, one such cloak ended up in the hands of the [[necromancer]] named [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]], who kept it in his workshop within the [[Moonrise Towers]] of [[Reithwin]] during the [[Absolute crisis]].
