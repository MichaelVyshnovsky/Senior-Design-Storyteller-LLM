'''Pumpkin soup''' was a soup whose ingredients consisted primarily of [[pumpkin]], [[spice]]s, and most often an ingredient that was secret to all but the cook. In the [[Sword Coast]] it was considered a traditional dish for the holiday [[Liar's Night]].

==Description==
Pumpkin soup was a thick and creamy soup with taste that made folk think of winter evenings in front of a hot hearth.

==History==
Pumpkin soup was the old staple of [[elf|elven]] cuisine eaten with a dash of spices in the days of [[Myth Drannor]]'s glory.
