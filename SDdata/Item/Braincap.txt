Braincaps were enchanted anti-illithid devices developed by the dwarves of Torglor to be used in their struggles against the mind flayers of Oryndoll in the Underdark.
Braincaps were tight skullcaps made of metal.
Braincaps provided the wearers with resistance to various spells of the enchantment school of magic and gave them immunity to mind blasts. These items could be made by skilled crafters of wondrous items with the use of the spell immunity incantation.
