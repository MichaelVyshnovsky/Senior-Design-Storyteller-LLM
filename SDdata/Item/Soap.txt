'''Soap''' was a cleaning substance created and used throughout the realms, even though was sometimes hard to find. When lathered it created foam that removed dirt and smell from skin, clothing, adventuring gear, or hair.

==Description==
Soaps were often molded into bars and scented with aromatic oils 

The daily soaps from [[Selgaunt]] popular in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] came in {{SI|4|oz|k|long=yes}} bars of several varieties: plain lye for 1 [[cp]], mild for 1 [[sp]], and scented for 1 [[gp]]. There were many available scents, but most popular [[Sembia]]n imported ones were ''Moonshae Spring'', ''Elven Wild'', ''Unicorn's Horn'', and ''Shining Sea''.

Usually soaps were created using tree [[oil]]s, but [[goblin]]s of [[Grodd]] used [[fungus]] of similar properties to create soaps, detergents, scented perfumes and aromatics.

==Usage==
Soaps were useful in everyday life for their cleaning properties, as well as during adventuring. Soap and [[wine]] could be used to dissolve slime produced by [[aboleth]]s that gets lodged in creatures' throats if inhaled.

Due to its high oil content, soap could be used as lubricant or for temporary waterproofing or sealing.

Soap was often a standard piece of equipment found in healing and medical facilities.

Special type of leather conditioner called saddle soap was used in the [[Dalelands]] together with leather [[oil]].

Priests of [[Azul]] used pumice soap to scrape themselves clean as the part of their faith's rituals.

Soap bubble-wetted piece of [[paper]] was one of the material components for the ''[[lighten load]]'' spell. A small piece of soap was the material component for the very rare ''[[remove smell]]'' spell. ''[[Cleanse]]'' spell could be cast using a piece of soap. And a soap bubble or a blown [[egg]] shell were needed to cast the ''[[sound bubble]]'' [[bard]]ic spell.
