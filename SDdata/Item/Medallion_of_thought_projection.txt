Medallions of thought projection were enchanted amulets that allowed the user to share their thoughts with creatures in front of them.
Medallions of thought projection were round metallic or golden discs with leather things that could be used to strap the medallion to ones forehead.
Medallions of thought projection allowed its wearer to broadcast their thoughts  straight in front of them. The major downside of using this item was its owner was unable to control the projection without rigorous training of the mind. With developed proficiency with the item, the user could control who the thoughts were projected on, while the rest of the creatures within range only received harmless vague impressions.
In the 14 century DR, a psionist Locke made a living using his medallion of thought projection as an entertainer. He used the amulet to mislead people into believing they were psychics. Locke also used his enchanted medallion to drastically improve his successes with the opposite gender.
*Locke - an entertainer who owned one of the medallions of thought projection. This particular item was enchanted even further by a hired wizard to add the ability to cast the permanent suggestion spell, the enchantment Locke often used in his act and on his romantic partners.
