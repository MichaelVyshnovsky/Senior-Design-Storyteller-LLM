{{wikipedia article|Zanthoxylum fagara}}
'''Fagara''' was a [[spice]] from [[T'u Lung]]. It was available for purchase in [[Faer√ªn]] through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Fagara was similar to [[peppercorn]]s in taste and size, but also with an added numbness and a mild tingling sensation. It was very potent, so a small portion was sufficient even for large dishes.
