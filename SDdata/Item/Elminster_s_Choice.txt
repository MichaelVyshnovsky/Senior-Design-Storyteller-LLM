'''Elminster's Choice''' was a popular [[beer]] exported from [[Immersea]] in [[Cormyr]] and sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The name was also attributed to a certain [[wine]].The name "Elminster's Choice" has been applied to both a beer and a wine at various points, and it is unclear if these are two separate, coincidentally named drinks or if the beer is misidentified as a wine. This article covers both types, with the rarer wine noted in the History section.

==Description==
This dark beer had a thick head and was clouded with yeast. It had a smokey aftertaste due to its bitterness.

==Availability==
The beer was brewed at the [[Five Fine Fish]] inn in Immersea, Cormyr. Batches were prepared almost every day and the inn stunk of the process.

Elminster's Choice could be purchased from Aurora's in the following containers:
* Hand keg: 14 [[cp]]
* Cask: 8 [[sp]]
* Barrel: (2 [[gp]]
* [[Butt]]: 7 gp
* [[Tun]]: 15 gp

Elminster's Choice was served at the [[Friendly Arm]] inn for a single [[gold]] [[coin]].

==Reputation==
One of the more popular beers supplied by Aurora's, it was favored by [[adventurer]]s active around the [[Wyvernwater]] in Cormyr.

It remained unclear if [[Elminster]] actually favored this beer (he was reputed to drink anything that could be counted as alcohol) or if it was a simple marketing ploy by those who brewed it.

==History==
Elminster's Choice was served at a reception for the [[Merchants' Guild]] held in the [[Sheaf of Wheat]] inn in [[Ghars]], Cormyr, on [[Eleint 19]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] suspected Mayor [[Tobald]] had drunk several [[mug]]s of either Elminster's Choice or [[Suzale]].

''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], the [[gnome]] [[bard]] [[Heino]] kept a stock of the Elminster's Choice wine and spent much of it on getting information out of a minor [[Thay]]an official.

On the world of [[Adenthia]], whilst celebrating defeating a returned [[Sammaster]] with a local adventurer named [[Gerana]] at the Wolf Keep tavern, Elminster declared a wine "the true Elminster's Choice".
