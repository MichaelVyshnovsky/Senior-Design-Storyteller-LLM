The horn totem was a dagger crafted from the horn of a dead oni known as the Ogre King. It was considered to be of great religious significance to the goblins who worshiped the Ogre King as a demigod from within the Barrow of the Ogre King in the Delimbiyr Vale.
The horn itself was straight and black. The base was wrapped in leather and the point was sharp enough to allow it to be wielded like a crude dagger.
The dagger was a goblin totem, meaning that merely holding it imbued the wielder with a confidence to face enemies much larger than they were, and thus made the wielder just a bit more dangerous when fighting bigger enemies.
The horn totem was fashioned by goblin worshipers of the Ogre King sometime after his death in the early 15 century DR, alongside a mace made of his skull known as the skull totem. When the goblins High Shaman, Sancossug, began plotting to revive the Ogre King in the late 1470s DR, these totems became vital as he believed he needed the Ogre Kings skeleton to be as intact as possible.
In the , the horn totem was stolen from the Barrow of the Ogre King by a wizard known as Curuvar the Brazen. In response to this theft, the goblins raided the town, blowing a hole in the southern wall with alchemists fire
