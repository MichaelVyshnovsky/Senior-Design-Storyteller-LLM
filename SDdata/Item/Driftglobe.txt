A '''''driftglobe''''' was a small glass orb that magically floated in the air and emitted light.

==Description==
A ''driftglobe'' was a small sphere of thick glass that weighed about 1 pound (0.45 kilograms).

==Powers==
The typical ''driftglobe'' had three basic magical effects, each activated with a different [[command word]] from a distance of up to {{SI|60|feet|long=yes}}. First, they glowed with bright light equivalent to a [[torch]], as per the [[cantrip]] ''[[light]]'', on command. Second, they could glow with the brightness of full daylight as per the spell ''[[daylight]]'' for an hour at a time. Use of this last ability was limited to 50 charges before being used up or was limited to only once a day.

Lastly, the ''driftglobe'' floated in the air and followed the creature that touched it while saying the command word, similar to a ''[[Tenser's floating disk]]''. It hovered approximately {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} or {{SI|6|feet|long=yes}} off the ground and no more than {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} from its owner. It moved quickly, much faster than a [[human]], but would descend safely to the ground if it couldn't keep up. It would also follow the most direct path, and would descend if blocked or impeded. When touched or commanded again, it deactivated and descended safely to the floor. Once descended, it would deactivate.

As an improvised fourth function, a hovering ''driftglobe'' could also be used to carry weights by means of a sling or net tied over it. It could carry only up to  {{SI|1|pound|k|long=yes}}.

==Creation==
''Driftglobes'' could be created by someone with skill in crafting [[magical item]]s and with access to the [[spell]]s ''daylight'' and ''Tenser's floating disk''.

==Usage==
[[File:Koboldtrap.png|thumb|right|Driftglobes'' were useful, but could be somewhat distracting...'']]
They were a useful aid to travelers, especially those exploring dark places and those on tight schedules who had to keep moving through the night. Naturally, ''driftglobes'' were quite popular with all kinds of [[adventurer]]s, and the likes of [[Rand Sharpsword]] recommended them.

''Driftglobes'' were also used for the internal lighting in various buildings. The [[House of the Moon]] temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in [[Waterdeep]] employed silvery-hued ''driftgloves'' in various rooms, including the main chapel, pantry, antechamber, and refectory, where knocking them back and forth between tables was a common sport at mealtimes.<ref> [[Candlekeep]] utilized ''driftglobes'' in monks' cells and in its tome-chambers.<ref>{{Cite web/An Introduction to Candlekeep}} They were also useful for underground lighting. A ''driftglobe'' provided lighting inside the [[Dawninghunt Vault]] in [[Cormyr]].<ref>

[[File:Seven-Stringed Harp.jpg|thumb|right|Driftglobes'' also provide great mood lighting.'']]
''Driftglobes'' of different colors were often used to provide pleasant, if dim, mobile illumination in inns, taverns, and restaurants, such as the [[The Wandering Wyvern (Iriaebor)|The Wandering Wyvern]] in [[Iriaebor]].<ref> There were colored ''driftglobes'' at the [[Sleepy Slyph]] in [[Waterdeep]],<ref> many-colored ones at [[Everwyvern House]] in [[Triboar]],<ref><ref> and pale mauve and brown ones at [[Beldar's Rest]] in [[Yartar]],<ref><ref> while many-colored ''driftglobes'' were put out at parties at [[Hawkwinter|Hawkwinter House]] in Waterdeep.<ref>  Blue was a popular color, with blue-hued ''driftglobes'' at the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in [[Baldur's Gate]],<ref> the [[The Seven-Stringed Harp]] in [[Secomber]],<ref> and [[A Pair of Black Antlers]] in [[Elturel]].<ref> They were even employed to supplement the bioluminescent [[fungi]] at the [[druid]]-run [[Old Troll's Foot]] restaurant in [[Kirinwood]].<ref> [[The Bent Helm]], a rowdy tavern in [[Elturel]], preferred to keep its driftglobes fixed in place and high above the brawls to avoid breakage; these ones even provided heating.<ref> The [[Running Stag]] in [[Berdusk]] kept its ''driftglobes'' above its mock branches, but these had an additional enchantment that caused them to change color from sunlight to moonlight in keeping with time of day.<ref> 

Finally, ''driftglobes'' were used to provide external lighting. Caged ''driftglobes'' were used for street lighting in [[Skullport]] in the [[Underdark]]<ref> and others were used at the wharf and warehouse of [[Falconstar Wayshipping]] in [[Wheloon]].<ref> In Myth Drannor, ''driftglobes'' were kept in small urns along the streets during the day and would emerge at nightfall, as detected by light-sensitive [[gems]] on the urns' necks. Through the night, the ''driftglobes'' moved around the city, following set patterns through assigned streets.

==Availability==
They were valued at 7,200 [[gold piece]]s. They were too expensive for much personal use.<ref>

''Driftglobes'' were sold at stores dealing in navigational aids, such as [[A Handful of Stars]] in [[Silverymoon]],<ref>

==History==
The [[arcanist]] [[Congenio Ioun]] created the first light-emitting ''[[ioun stone]]s'' sometime in the age of [[Netheril]] but these were personal items that remained near their owner.

True ''driftglobes'' dated back to at least the time of [[Cormanthyr]] at its height and were seen lighting up the night in Myth Drannor before its [[Weeping War |Fall]] in [[714 DR]]. A still-functioning ''driftglobe'' could be found above a card table in the [[Neirdrecrypt]] in Myth Drannor by the mid-1300s DR.<ref>

A [[Nyth (creature)|nyth]] in Skullport posed as a caged ''driftglobe'' lamp in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, striking at lone passers-by before moving on. It killed at least nine people in this way.

In Waterdeep ''circa'' [[1492 DR]], hundreds of ''driftglobes'' from around the city moved of their accord from dusk and collected in the [[City of the Dead]]. They returned to their places at dawn the next day.<ref>

In the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} ''driftglobes'' hovered in the air over some streets in [[Neverwinter]] and were left to glow even in the daylight hours. During that city's [[High Sun Games]], when [[Simon Aumar]] used the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'', a wave of the ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'' spell swept through [[Castle Never]] and into the city streets, causing ''driftglobes'' to shut down, drop, and smash on the road.<ref>{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
