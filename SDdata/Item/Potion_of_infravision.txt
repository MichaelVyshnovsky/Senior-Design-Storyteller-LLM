'''''Potions of infravision''''' were a type of [[potion]] that allowed the imbiber see in the dark.

==Description==
These potions had a brackish taste.

==Powers==
This potion temporarily gave the imbiber the ability to see in [[infravision]]. A [[human]] who took this potion would be capable of seeing in infravision with a {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} range. If the potion was taken by a creature who had natural infravision abilities, their sight range increased by {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.

==Creation==
An ''elixir of darkvision'' could be created by combining the [[alchemical]]ly-extracted essence of [[crystal]]line [[lens]]es and certain types of [[salt]]s.
