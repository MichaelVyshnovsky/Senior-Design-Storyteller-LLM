'''''The Salamander's Tongue''''' was a unique enchanted [[dagger]] that possessed several powerful enchantments and colorful history.

==Description==
''The Salamander's Tongue'' was an exotic grim-looking [[kris]] with a wavy blade that split at the end into two ends akin to a reptile's tongue. At the center of the blade, near its grip, a small living part of a [[salamander]]'s tongue was grafted onto the dagger with some sinister magics. The tongue was bright red. It pulsed and wriggled around independent from the blade's owner.

==Powers==
The ''Tongue'' possessed a ''+3'' enchantment as well as increased the wielder's defenses against [[poison]]s, granted them resistance to fire, and made them undetectable by magical means. Additionally, the dagger had a chance of dealing additional fire damage upon a successful strike.

==History==
The true origins of the ''Tongue'' were shrouded in mystery; however, it was believed that the dagger's first wielder was the infamous [[gnome]] [[assassin]] from [[Westgate]] named [[Turlam Shallowhill]]. After he was killed by a rival scoundrel, a [[halfling]] [[Deder]] Seven Fingers, the dagger swapped owners. Deder was not aware of the dagger's enchantments and kept it as a trophy until it was stolen by his flunkey, a fellow halfling, [[Kreshinal Blackhound]]. Kreshinal fled from departed Westgate for [[Selgaunt]], moving the dagger with him, staying there for five years that followed. Blackhound discovered one of the ''Salamander's Tongue's'' enchantments that allowed him to stay hidden, being undetectable by ''[[divination]]s''. Subsequently, Kreshinal lost the ''Tongue'' in a derailed gambling scam and later was assassinated by Deder's thugs. Sembian criminal underbelly was in possession of the dagger while Seven Fingers attempted to reclaim his lost treasure. Deder successfully eliminated many members of the rival faction of Selgaunt and reclaimed what was his.

While Deder Seven Fingers was pouring all of his attention into routing the thieves of Selgaunt and returning the ''Salamander's Tongue'', [[Sembian]] criminals hired [[Pieter the Feeble]], a priest of [[Mask]], to infiltrate and undermine Deder's operations. The priest successfully manipulated Westgate and Selgaunt thieves into crippling each other's organizations. Pieter became the ''Tongue's'' next master and took the dagger off Deder's dead body with him to [[Hillsfar]]. Pieter the Feeble thought himself safe from vengeful demihumans of Deder's gang in the city that hated their kind.

In Hillsfar, Pieter sold the ''Salamander's Tongue'' to a [[Mulmaster Hawk]] in a plot to attract rich buyers and murdering them for cash. However, the Mulmaster Hawk survived the ordeal and escaped with the dagger only to be later murdered by a priestess of [[Umberlee]] who was outraged at the Hawk's refusal to pay tithe to the Bitch Queen. In possession of the [[Church of Umberlee]], the ''Salamander's Tongue'' traveled as far as three thousand miles away from Sembia.

By [[1281 DR]], the ''Salamander's Tongue'' reached the underground complex of [[Dorn's Deep]] on the [[Spine of the World]] under control of [[devil]] [[Belhifet]]. The dagger was wielded by one of his lieutenants, [[Seth]]. He was slain by the heroes of [[Ten Towns]] hence the dagger switched owners once more.
