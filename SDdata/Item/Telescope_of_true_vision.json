        "mainbody": "elescopes of true vision were incredibly useful enchanted spyglasses that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThese spyglasses were cylindrical and often made of precious metal such as gold.\nA telescope of true vision provided the mundane ability of magnifying a viewed object by a factor of 50. Thus a ship at sea from  away would appear to be 100 feet away when viewed through the spyglass.\nThe enchantment upon these spyglasses pierced illusions and other magical misdirection, allowing the viewer to see an object in its true form.\nA telescope of true vision had 20 charges. Upon using the last charge the lens would crack and the item would be ruined."
