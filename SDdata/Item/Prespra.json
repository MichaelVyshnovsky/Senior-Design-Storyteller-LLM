        "mainbody": "respa, also known as \"Mothers Bane\", was an ingested poison that was only effective against humans.\nPrespa was colorless and odorless. It mixed easily with any drinkable liquid except for milk or other dairy products.\nPrespa caused dizziness and vision impairment when drunk. It also led to blotchy, red patches on the surface of the skin as blood vessels burst and caused damage to the imbiber. This effect was aggravated by further bodily damage.\nPrespa was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage, Lethchauntos the Black, during his time spent with an orc tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage, Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists."
