        "mainbody": "Cartographers tools, sometimes called map-making kits, were sets of tools and equipment for making precise maps and to effectively extract information from a map.\nA typical complete set of cartographers tools contained calipers, compasses, ink, parchment, a quill, and a ruler.\nSophisticated and more fully equipped map-making kits were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, containing gridded parchment, charcoal markers, different nibs for the quill, a stenciled ruler and an instructional manual for map making and reading, called the Handbook of Mapping for Better Mapping Etiquette.\nUsers trained in the use of cartographers tools developed a deep familiarity with geography and terrain. They were capable of reading the lay of the land so that they could find routes to civilized areas, understand the changes that terrains underwent over time, and predict the location of favorable areas for settlements. When exploring new areas, experts in mapmaking hardly ever got lost, and could draw maps on the road while performing other tasks."
