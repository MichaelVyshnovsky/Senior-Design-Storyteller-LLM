        "mainbody": "Gunpowder wands were some of the first handguns known outside of the island nation of Lantan.\nThese firearms were plated in silver and carried up to two shots. Unlike other Lantanese firearms, which used the substance smokepowder, as their name implied gunpowder wands operated on gunpowder that had been divinely enchanted into a non-inert state by high-ranking priests of Gond with their deitys blessing.\n* Wendeira Illathos, a devout worshiper of Gond, owned a consecrated pair of gunpowder wands that she kept in her boots. She would use them whenever she went out hunting or needed to defend her shop, Wendeiras Wondery."
