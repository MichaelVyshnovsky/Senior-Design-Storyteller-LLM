An eversmoking bottle was an item that constantly leaked smoke out, provided the stopper was open.
Typical eversmoking bottles were stoppered bottles made of brass.
Unstoppering the bottle caused a cloud of thick smoke to fill a radius of  within a few seconds, blocking vision entirely. The cloud expanded as long as the bottle remained open, out to a maximum radius of  over several minutes. Closing the bottle required the user to speak its command word, after which the smoke dissipated over a few minutes. Strong winds could also dissipate the smoke.
