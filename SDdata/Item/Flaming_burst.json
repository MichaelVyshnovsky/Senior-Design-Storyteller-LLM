        "mainbody": "'''''Flaming burst''''' was a [[weapon quality|weapon enchantment]] that caused flames to sheathe a weapon and explode against a target.",
        "Powers": "In addition to serving as a ''[[flaming]]'' weapon, a critical strike against a foe triggered an explosion of fire against them. It would do this even if the flames were not sheathing the blade.\n\nThe flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition fired from them.",
        "Creation": "The creator must use ''[[flame blade]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'', or ''[[fireball]]'' to add the ''flaming'' property.\n\nIt could not be used to enhance weapons formed from [[dlarun]] as it was inherently resistant to fire.",
        "Uses": "Some veteran [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ''flaming burst'' weapons. \n\nExperienced zealots of the [[Order of the Black Flame]] could imbue their weapons with properties for up to a minute at a time.\n\n[[Helmed horror]]s could enhance their blades with several magical qualities, including ''flaming burst''.\n\nA number of different spells either conjured or modified weapons with a temporary ''flaming burst'' effect. Among these spells were ''[[sun scepter]]''  and ''[[Sakkaratar's triple strike]]''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Daelegoth Orndeir]], the [[Sunmaster]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun]] owned a ''+3 flaming burst [[shadowscourge]] [[light mace]]''.\n* [[Harbromm]], the King of [[Citadel Adbar]] carried a ''+3 flaming burst'' [[dwarven waraxe]].\n* [[Inash]], the leader of the [[Golden Skulls]] wielded a ''+2 flaming burst [[longsword]]''.",
        "Notable ''Flaming Burst'' Weapons": "* ''[[Flame tongue]], a variety of magical flaming longsword.''\n* ''[[Grayflame]]'', the ''+3 longsword'' of [[Dabron Sashenstar]], a famous [[Baldurian nobility|nobleman]] and explorer from [[Baldur's Gate]]."
