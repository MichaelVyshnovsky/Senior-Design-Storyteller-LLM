        "mainbody": "Flaming burst was a weapon enchantment that caused flames to sheathe a weapon and explode against a target.\nIn addition to serving as a flaming weapon, a critical strike against a foe triggered an explosion of fire against them. It would do this even if the flames were not sheathing the blade.\nThe flames that enveloped the weapon did not harm the wielder. Missile weapons conferred this ability on any ammunition fired from them.\nThe creator must use flame blade, flame strike, or fireball to add the flaming property.\nIt could not be used to enhance weapons formed from dlarun as it was inherently resistant to fire.\nSome veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as flaming burst weapons. \nExperienced zealots of the Order of the Black Flame could imbue their weapons with properties for up to a minute at a time.\nHelmed horrors could enhance their blades with several magical qualities, including flaming burst.\nA number of different spells either conjured or modified weapons with a temporary flaming burst effect. Among these spells were sun scepter  and Sakkaratars triple strike.\n* Daelegoth Orndeir, the Sunmaster of the Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun owned a +3 flaming burst shadowscourge light mace.\n* Harbromm, the King of Citadel Adbar carried a +3 flaming burst dwarven waraxe.\n* Inash, the leader of the Golden Skulls wielded a +2 flaming burst longsword.\n* Flame tongue, a variety of magical flaming longsword.\n* Grayflame, the +3 longsword of Dabron Sashenstar, a famous nobleman and explorer from Baldurs Gate."
