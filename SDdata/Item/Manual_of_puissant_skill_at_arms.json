        "mainbody": "A manual of puissant skill at arms was a powerful magical tome that could instil great wisdom and experience in a warrior.\nA fighter or bard that studied the manual for one month not only benefited from its in-depth accounts of fighting styles, but was magically instilled with the experience they needed to take their martial skills to the next level and then some. They could not benefit from reading the manual a second time.\nRangers and paladins were able to read the contents, but did not magically benefit from the magical power of the manual. Clerics and rogues found the book completely incomprehensible, and a wizard who dared scan its pages found themselves stunned and reeling as their arcane experiences were torn from them.\n* The book-collecting lich Adzerak held a manual in his library collection at Barrenstone."
