        "mainbody": "The '''Golden Blades''' were [[sword]]s crafted during the [[Shou]] [[Dynasty of Might]].",
        "History": "The first emperor of the [[Li Dynasty]] ordered nine [[magical]] swords crafted for each of his generals and ordered them to conquer the world. Each blade was crafted to match the talents of its wielder. Over time, the swords were scattered and many were lost to history. Legend had it that the person who reunited the swords would usher in a new dynasty.\n\nAs of [[1479 DR]], one of the swords was in the possession of [[Duc-Sum Li]], regent of the [[Xiousing]] district in [[Marsember]].",
        "Abilities": "The sword held by Duc-Sum enhanced the wielder's athletic ability and had the ability to turn aside an opponent's attack. The power of the sword varied with the skill of the wielder, with high-level swordsmen gaining a +3 bonus.",
        "Known Swords": "The [[Nine Golden Swords]] in Xiousing possessed three of the blades. Duc-Sum's sword was the only other known to exist as of [[1479 DR]]."
