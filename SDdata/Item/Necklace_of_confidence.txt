In 1369 DR, the necklace of confidence could be found within a dried up well of magic water in the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The amulet was thrown in there at some point before or during the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War. Later, the room with he well became haunted by bloodthirstily master wight and its four undead servants.
