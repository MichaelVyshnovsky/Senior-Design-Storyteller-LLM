        "mainbody": "Tempests Touch was a type of enchanted bow that shot seemingly unlimited supply of lightning arrows.\nThese magic bows possessed +2 enchantments that aided the shooters aim and helped the missiles reach the targets. Tempests Touch did not need ammo as it manifested magic arrows imbued with the power of lightning. Additionally, the wielder received protection from electricity while holding the weapon.\nSome years before the late 14 century DR, a tribe of reclusive wood elves inhabited a small unnamed island on the Sea of Fallen Stars. They were responsible for creating numerous Tempests Touch bows. Sages said the elves learned to harness the fiercest storms that passed the sea into these weapons through strange rituals. However, the wood elves were forced to abandon their island home after several years of abnormally calm weather. It was theorized that Thayan wizards were responsible for the weather manipulation, protecting the Red Wizards merchant vessels.\nIn the , one of the Tempests Touch bows was sold by one of the exotic weapon dealers in Westgates Market Triangle."
