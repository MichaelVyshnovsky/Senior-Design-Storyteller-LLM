'''''Lamps of the four winds''''' were [[magical item]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. These special lamps were only used by [[holy slayer]]s.

==Powers==
These lamps could be used to summon one to three [[wind walker]]s every three days. The wind walkers were required to obey their master for the duration of the three day period, or until a specific task was carried out.
