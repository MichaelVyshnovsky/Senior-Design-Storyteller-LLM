Lamps of the four winds were magical items that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. These special lamps were only used by holy slayers.
These lamps could be used to summon one to three wind walkers every three days. The wind walkers were required to obey their master for the duration of the three day period, or until a specific task was carried out.
