'''''Valamir's Slayer''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] blackened [[steel]] [[short sword]] that belonged to a hero, interred with honors, sometime before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]].

==Powers==
This longsword possessed a strong ''+5 enchantment'' and increased the wielder's constitution. Along with strengthening health, ''Valamir's Slayer'' granted the wielder limited resistance to [[spell]]s of arcane and divine nature. Lastly, the blade allowed its owner to cast the ''[[slay living]]'' spell at will. It held two charges of the deadly and powerful spell.

==History==
''Valamir's Slayer'' accompanied its master after their death. In [[1369 DR]], the weapon could be found in a dwarven tomb complex within the deepest level of the [[Elven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. The series of interlocking crypts were guarded by [[iron golem|dwarven statues]] and magics that unleashed incorporeal [[undead]] creatures on grave robbers.
