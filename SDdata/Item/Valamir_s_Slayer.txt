Valamirs Slayer was a unique enchanted blackened steel short sword that belonged to a hero, interred with honors, sometime before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War.
This longsword possessed a strong +5 enchantment and increased the wielders constitution. Along with strengthening health, Valamirs Slayer granted the wielder limited resistance to spells of arcane and divine nature. Lastly, the blade allowed its owner to cast the slay living spell at will. It held two charges of the deadly and powerful spell.
Valamirs Slayer accompanied its master after their death. In 1369 DR, the weapon could be found in a dwarven tomb complex within the deepest level of the Elven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. The series of interlocking crypts were guarded by dwarven statues and magics that unleashed incorporeal undead creatures on grave robbers.
