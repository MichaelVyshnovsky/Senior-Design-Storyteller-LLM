Smoke-cured ham, or simply smoked ham, was a variety of ham, cooked and cured by the smoke of hot burning wood.
Smoke-cured ham was sliced to order. It had a distinctly salty and smoky taste.
Cubes of smoked ham were an ingredient in the rustic split pea soup from the Dalelands in central Faer√ªn.
In the late 15 century DR, sliced up smoke-cured ham was served at the Lonesome Tankard of Eveningstar in the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr.
