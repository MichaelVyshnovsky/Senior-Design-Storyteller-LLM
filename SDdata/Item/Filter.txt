Filters were scientific items in the Realms often used by wizards in their laboratories to separate substances during research.
A filter was usually a sheet of gauze or coarse screen straw mesh. Linen and silk screens were also used.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 1 silver piece or gold piece per square foot depending on the material.
* Filters were favored by wizards.
