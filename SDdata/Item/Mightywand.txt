A '''''rod of many wands''''', '''''mightywand''''', or '''''gonne of many wands''''' was a device capable of triggering a number of wands at the same time.

==Description==
Usually, a ''rod of many wands'' was a mace-like construction with a haft wrapped in leather. The far end was about twice as thick, with three depressions on which wands were to be mounted.

==Powers==
A ''rod of many wands'' allowed the wands mounted on it to be activated as one with a long, complex [[Draconic]] invocation, at the cost of draining additional charges from all wands.

==History==
The [[War Wizard]] [[Belantra]] in [[Cormyr]] used a version that had a full half-dozen wands instead in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, on the night on which [[Elminster Aumar]], the [[Chosen of Mystra]], came to talk to [[Caladnei]]. Whatever those wands were, triggering three blasted apart the flagstones from under Elminster's feet, ripped up the ceiling, and generally raised a cloud of dust. One of the wands, whether it was triggered with the three or not, launched a green ray that melted flesh.

==Reputation==
Elminster later claimed he'd helped [[Vangerdahast]] enspell the device in use by Belantra, and it was annoying to see it wasted in a ''mightywand'' of the [[Lantanna]] fashion, strongly implying the device resembled a Lantanna ''gonne of many wands''.
