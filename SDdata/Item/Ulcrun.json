        "mainbody": "Ulcrun was an insinuated poison.\nUlcrun was a thick liquid with a milky-white coloring.\nShortly after being introduced to its victim by insinuation, ulcrun caused damage to muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments, and continued to do so for a short time thereafter. Until proper healing could be obtained, the poison left the victim weaker and with slightly reduced motor functions. Ulcrun was effective against any warm-blooded creature.\nUlcrun was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as The Nathlum. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage Lethchauntos the Black, during his time spent with an orc tribe in the 10 century DR. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage Phrandjas of Port Llast and sold to local alchemists before the midâ€“14 century DR."
