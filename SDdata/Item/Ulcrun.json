        "mainbody": "'''Ulcrun''' was an insinuated [[poison]].",
        "Description": "Ulcrun was a thick liquid with a milky-white coloring.",
        "Effects": "Shortly after being introduced to its victim by insinuation, ulcrun caused damage to muscles, tendons, bones, and ligaments, and continued to do so for a short time thereafter. Until proper healing could be obtained, the poison left the victim weaker and with slightly reduced motor functions. Ulcrun was effective against any warm-blooded creature.",
        "History": "Ulcrun was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as ''[[The Nathlum]]''. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the mage [[Lethchauntos the Black]], during his time spent with an [[orc]] tribe in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage [[Phrandjas]] of [[Port Llast]] and sold to local [[alchemist]]s before the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR."
