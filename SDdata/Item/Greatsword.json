        "mainbody": "Greatswords were a type of two-handed, martial sword.\nA derivative of the longsword, the greatsword was the largest member of the sword family, requiring two hands to wield it. The hilt was elongated to accommodate this extra grip and the blade was doubled-edged. Some versions had parrying hooks (Parierhaken) on their blade, about  away from the guard. The blades were typically dull between their parrying hooks and guard so that they could be gripped there.\nDue to their size and weight greatswords required a good deal of training in order to wield effectively.
