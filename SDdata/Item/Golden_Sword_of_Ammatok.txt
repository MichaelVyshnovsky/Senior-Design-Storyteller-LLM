The '''Golden Sword of Ammatok''' was an important [[sword]] in the kingdom of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group="note">It is not known who or what "Ammatok" is.

Each year after he took the throne in the 1350s [[DR]], a ceremony held on [[Wei Do Peak]] to honor King [[Wanang Sun]] culminated with the king himself ritually beheading the most infamous criminal in the kingdom's prisons. This act symbolized his power to defeat evil in the kingdom. It was rumored that when the king wielded the Golden Sword of Ammatok to do this duty, a spirit of the [[Celestial Empire|Celestial Heavens]] would appear beside him and consecrate his rule under their guidance.<ref group="note">It is not clear if the Golden Sword is in Wanang Sun's possession, or if it is lost.
