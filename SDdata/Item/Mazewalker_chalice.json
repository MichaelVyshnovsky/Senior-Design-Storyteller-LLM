        "mainbody": "'''''Mazewalker chalices''''' were [[enchanted]] items used by the [[Mazewalker]]s, [[cleric]]s of the [[Chult]]an deity [[Ubtao]].",
        "Description": "These chalices were crafted out of [[gold]]. They lacked any kinds of decorations and adornments, apart from a maze-like pattern engraved onto their bases.",
        "Powers": "It was believed that any creature that did not venerate Ubtao went mad after looking at the maze on the chalice's base. The effects of the madness were similar to those of the ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell. This ability could be triggered once per day.",
        "History": "The maze etchings were the evidence of the item's origins - the fabled Chultan city of Mezro. One of these enchanted chalices found its way from the [[Chultan Peninsula]] to the [[Sword Coast]] sometime before [[1372 DR]] and moved through the hands of several collectors. Its last owner was [[Vladmyr]], the shady curio trader from [[Daggerford]]. He tasked the [[Hero of Daggerford]] with tracking down and recovery of several pieces for his collection. These items were lost while being transported in an unsecured trading wagon through an especially bumpy patch of the [[Trade Way]]. After falling out of the wagon - they were swept away from the road by a rainstorm. A ''Mazewalker chalice'' was found by some unfortunate person who met his doom at the teeth, fangs, and whiskers of the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]] and its swarm of hungry rodents. The chalice was recovered from the rat's lair in the [[Lonely Barrens]] and given to Vladmyr."
