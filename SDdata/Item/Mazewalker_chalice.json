        "mainbody": "Mazewalker chalices were enchanted items used by the Mazewalkers, clerics of the Chultan deity Ubtao.\nThese chalices were crafted out of gold. They lacked any kinds of decorations and adornments, apart from a maze-like pattern engraved onto their bases.\nIt was believed that any creature that did not venerate Ubtao went mad after looking at the maze on the chalices base. The effects of the madness were similar to those of the feeblemind spell. This ability could be triggered once per day.\nThe maze etchings were the evidence of the items origins - the fabled Chultan city of Mezro. One of these enchanted chalices found its way from the Chultan Peninsula to the Sword Coast sometime before 1372 DR and moved through the hands of several collectors. Its last owner was Vladmyr, the shady curio trader from Daggerford. He tasked the Hero of Daggerford with tracking down and recovery of several pieces for his collection. These items were lost while being transported in an unsecured trading wagon through an especially bumpy patch of the Trade Way. After falling out of the wagon - they were swept away from the road by a rainstorm. A Mazewalker chalice was found by some unfortunate person who met his doom at the teeth, fangs, and whiskers of the Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor and its swarm of hungry rodents. The chalice was recovered from the rats lair in the Lonely Barrens and given to Vladmyr."
