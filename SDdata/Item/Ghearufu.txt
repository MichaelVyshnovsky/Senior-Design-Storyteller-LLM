The Ghearufu was a set of magical items, consisting of a golden-edged mirror on a gold chain that could be hung around the neck and a pair of mismatched gloves, one white and one black.
Not much was known about the Ghearufus history. The magical items were believed to have been created on the lower planes millennia before the 14 century DR. The last wielder of the items was the assassin known as Ghost, who had the items in his possession for over a century by the 1360s DR.
Around 1361 DR, the power of the Ghearufu was used by the assassin Ghost to control the bodies of Vander and his brother Nameless Danica Maupoissant (but only partially) and Brennan Harriman. The items were destroyed by the great red dragon Fyrentennimar at the behest of Cadderly Bonaduce.
The magic of the Ghearufu let the wielder switch bodies with their target, transferring their soul and mind to the others body while the victims soul and mind went to the wielders body.
The wielder had to have the victim look into the mirror of the set, so they could then establish a psychic link with the victim and take over their body. The magical items transferred with the wielder to the new body.
