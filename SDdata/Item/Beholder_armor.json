The beholder rested on a seat of sorts atop the shoulders, and was tied in securely with straps and buckles.\nBeholder armor was used by beholders that wished to have a more \"hands on\" experience in combat. Once attached it allowed the beholder to walk about at a quick pace and use both gauntlet hands to hold items or weapons in addition to their typical beholderish abilities."
