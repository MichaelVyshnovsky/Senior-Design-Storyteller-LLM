        "mainbody": "'''''Beholder armor''''' was an odd kind of magical device used by [[beholder]]s to walk around.",
        "Description": "The ''armor'' was very closely resembled ''[[full plate mail]] +1'' used by [[humanoid]]s, but was built specifically for beholders to use. The beholder rested on a seat of sorts atop the shoulders, and was tied in securely with straps and buckles.",
        "Powers": "''Beholder armor'' was used by beholders that wished to have a more \"hands on\" experience in combat. Once attached it allowed the beholder to walk about at a quick pace and use both [[gauntlet]] hands to hold items or weapons in addition to their typical beholderish abilities."
