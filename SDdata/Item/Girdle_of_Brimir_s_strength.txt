The '''''girdle of Brimir's strength''''' was a unique variant of ''[[girdle of giant strength]]'' that was made by [[Brimir]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|19}} as a gift to a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].

==Description==
This girdle was made from a strip of rawhide that Brimir had cut off his own giant-sized [[belt]] and had a crimson hue from being thoroughly stained with his blood. The girdle's clasp was carved from the tooth of a [[bulette]].  All along the girdle's length, [[Giant language|Giantish runes]] were carved into it.

==Powers==
Enchanted with [[rune magic]], the ''girdle of Brimir's strength'' gave its wearer tremendous strength, much like a standard ''girdle of giant strength''. Where the belt differed in effect was causing the wearer to grow to a height of {{SI|12|ft}}. These effects only lasted for up to four hours per day. After the effect was deactivated the wearer temporarily felt weaker than before and needed to rest for around twice the amount of time that the effect was active for.

==History==
Sometime around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff journeyed to Jotunheim in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]] so they could learn how to destroy a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2-3}}

According to some sources they came to [[Okalnir|Brimir's hall]] as honored guests of his friend [[Habrok Icecaster]], having proven their worth to him and his friends by hunting a bulette.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21-22}}

In eating they faced off against the [[fire giant]] [[Logi]] and had to reach the middle of a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} trencher of stew. In drinking they faced no one, but had to drink alcohol from a massive horn as fast as they could. In running they faced the young giant [[Hugi]] and had to make it to the far end of the hall. Finally, in wrestling they faced Brimir's old mother [[Elli]], as the giants felt any other competitor would make things unfair.

Some claimed the adventurers managed to beat all four tests and for showing such prowess Brimir chose to give them an additional gift, creating the ''girdle of Brimir's strength''.
