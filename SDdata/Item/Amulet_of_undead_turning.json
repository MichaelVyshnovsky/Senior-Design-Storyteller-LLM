        "mainbody": "Amulets of undead turning were divine magic amulets that aided the bearers in the strife against the undead.\nAmulets of undead turning were usable by good-aligned clerics and paladins only. These amulets allowed their users to turn or rebuke undead creatures more often than normally. Each additional use of the amulets magic costed one of its fifty charges. The amulets of undead turning also created the area of bright white light around them.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the amulets of undead turning were often given out by rich temples of goodly deities to the faithful to aid them on the holy missions against the undead. Most commonly, these amulets were found among the followers of Lathander.\nIn 1372 DR, the amulets of undead turning were available for purchase in Moonglow Tower of Daggerford."
