An ebon lash was a type of magical +2 scourge created by the Red Wizards of Thay for use by their agents. Though some came in the form of a +1 whip.
Any person or creature that was struck by an ebon lash were dazed as if they were affected by the spell of the same name. Additionally, the wielder of the whip could evoke the spell charm person once per day,
Ebon lashes that took the form of a scourge were known to inflict intense pain, an effect comparable to the spell Nybors gentle reminder.
* Lauzoril, one of the eight leaders of the Red Wizards of Thay.
