        "Description": "Usually rough crystal scapras were found in pale to medium yellow hues. This stone could be easily worked even by the unskilled, and could be facet cut, but was too soft for everyday wear in rings or on clothing. A typical specimen has a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "This stone could be added to the material component of the ''[[guards and wards]]'' spell and enhanced its effects but was consumed in the casting. Specifically, each scapra added allowed one additional magical effect (''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[magic mouth]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', or ''[[suggestion]]'') or a ''[[phantasmal force]]''. Up to five scapras could be used, granting a total of five additional effects."
