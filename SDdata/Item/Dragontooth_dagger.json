        "mainbody": "A '''''dragontooth dagger''''' was quite simply, a [[dagger]] crafted from the tooth of a [[dragon]]. Their use was associated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that emerged as a threat to the Realms in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "These crudely-made weapons involved using the sharp tooth of the dragon as its blade, with a simple [[leather]] wrap around its base to form a handle.",
        "Powers": "While not magical in nature, ''dragontooth daggers'' allowed its wielder to strike at their foes with increased accuracy. Depending on the dragon from which the tooth was extracted,<ref group=\"note\">While it was not explicitly stated that teeth from different dragons have different elemental associations, the phrasing of \"a hit with ''this'' weapon (inflicts additional acidic damage)\", suggests the use of different ''dragontooth dagger'' would inflict a different form of damage. the dagger could inflict a form of elemental damage, such as the acidic destruction associated with the breath weapon of [[black dragon]]s.",
        "History": "The ''dragontooth dagger'' belonging to a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon was found at the divination pool within the [[Tomb of Diderius]] some time in the 1480s [[DR]]. It was believed to have been used as a sacrificial weapon by the cultist.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Varramzord]], the White [[wyrmspeaker]] of the Cult of the Dragon."
