        "mainbody": "'''''Cyclocones''''' were a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] hat that radiated a dim [[evocation]] dweomer.",
        "Description": "These hats were pointed and rather ordinary looking, but had a distinctive design.",
        "Powers": "''Cyclocones'' were activated by pointing their small end toward the ground and then tossing them forward with a spinning motion. The hat would then begin to rotate at blurring speeds, until it grew into a miniature whirlwind that would move forward in a straight line until a solid, sturdy object caused it to break up.\n\nOn average, the whirlwind generated by a ''cyclocone'' measured roughly {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} wide at the base and {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} wide at the top. Height varied depending upon ceiling height, but they could grow to be as tall as {{SI|45|ft|long=yes}}. Despite their size, these whirlwinds were powerful.\n\nThese items were only usable by [[mage]]s. They were generally one-use only, being destroyed after their whirlwind dissipated, but by [[1281 DR]] one could find ''cyclocones'' that had multiple usages and gave their wearer ''+1 armor''.",
        "History": "Prior to [[1281 DR]], these hats were highly sought after by wizards. However, over time their distinct appearance became a frequent source of mockery from [[adventurer]]s.\n\nWhen a mage from [[Immersea]] named [[Bemban]] grew senile in his older years, he left most of his fortune to private mages in hopes that they would honor his wish to see ''cyclocones'' continue continue to be made.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Ahghairon]]'s [[Ahghairon's tower|tower]] had an alarm system that included an invisible ''[[force field]]'' that, if [[dispel magic|dispelled]], would by means of ''[[contingency]]'' sound warning [[horn|trumpets]] and activate a ''cyclocone'' that would whirl about the tower in a ring.\n* Bemban of Immersea.\n* The adventurer [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]] owned a ''cyclocone''."
