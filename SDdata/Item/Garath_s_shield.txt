'''''Garath's shield''''' was an ancient, [[enchanted]] shield in the [[Kingdom of Mertwig]], presumably once owned by someone named Garath.

==Powers==
This shield carried a ''+3 enchantment'', providing its wielder much greater protection.

==History==
When King [[Mertwig]] was on the verge of death at age 65, various fortune hunters and individuals claiming to be his long-lost heirs scoured his kingdom in search of wealth and treasure. ''Garath's shield'' ended up being one of nine [[magical item]]s that the would-be heirs of Mertwig would discover during their journey.
