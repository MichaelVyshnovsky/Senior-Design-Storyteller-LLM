If one were to cast detect magic on it, they would find that it radiated an aura of divination magic.\nActivating this device required holding down on its trigger.

A group of adventurers later came to the temple due to these events and while there learned of Nims plight, who proceeded to gift them his nimblewright detector and teach them how it worked."
