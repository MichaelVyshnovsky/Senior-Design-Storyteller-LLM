'''''Halbdol''''' was a special paste used in the [[Cold Lands]], specifically in [[Narfell]].{{cite book/The Fall of Highwatch/MMP|148-149}}

==Description==
''Halbdol'' was a thick black paste that gave off a flowery smell with a hint of mint.

==Uses==
This paste was spread over the eyelids and around the nose and mouth, making it easier to breathe in the harsh cold climate. It could even keep eyes from freezing.
