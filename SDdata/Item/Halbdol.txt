Halbdol was a special paste used in the Cold Lands, specifically in Narfell.
Halbdol was a thick black paste that gave off a flowery smell with a hint of mint.
This paste was spread over the eyelids and around the nose and mouth, making it easier to breathe in the harsh cold climate. It could even keep eyes from freezing.
