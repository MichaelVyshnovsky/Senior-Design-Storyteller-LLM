        "Description": "These polarms had a reach of {{SIrange|5|10|ft|long=yes}} and required two hands to wield them properly. Over two-thirds of their reach was taken up by the polearm's shaft, with the rest taken up by the \"pincer\", which often measured {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} in length. On average they weighed about {{SI|20|lb}}.\n\nTheir namesake pincers could grapple creatures within the [[demihuman]] size range, going as large as a [[gnoll]].",
