'''''Orc-Slayer''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] that belonged to [[Harpo Bogglinn]], a [[hin]] prince, in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Orc-Slayer'' blade was ensorcelled to be effective when used against [[orc]]s and orckind. When the blade was near an orc, within {{SI|50'|'"|long=yes}}, the sword shivered as if eagerly excited to shed some orc and [[orog]] blood. When used in battle against orckind, the ''Orc-Slayer's'' formidable ''+2'' enchantment became a powerful ''+4'' magic that guided the wielder's hand towards the orcish opponents. Each strike against such enemies had its damage magically doubled.

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Price Harpo Bogglinn was exiled from [[Toril]] by his father. To redeem himself and return home, the halfling waged a one-hin war against orcs. The ''Orc-Slayer'' blade had been used to end the lives of one thousand and one orcs.
