        "mainbody": "A black sickle was a magical sickle of unholy power.\nIn combat, the black sickle could be wielded as a sickle +2.\nThis evil weapon was the bane of plants and plant-based creatures. Upon striking a normal plant, it suffered an instant withering death along with all other normal plants and vegetation within a radius of 30 feet (9 meters). Plant-based monsters (myconids, shambling mounds, treants, and so forth) had a chance of resisting this herbicidal fate, but even if they managed to avoid it, they were compelled to make like a tree and leaf the area at once."
