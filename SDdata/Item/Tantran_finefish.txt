'''Tantran finefish''' was a type of pickled [[fish]] dish produced in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Those who didn't enjoy it disparaged it as '''silvermuck'''.

Locally caught fish were spiced and pickled to make finefish. This was barreled in Tantras then exported across [[Faerûn]], as one of the city's major products.
