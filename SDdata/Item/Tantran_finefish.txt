Tantran finefish was a type of pickled fish dish produced in the city of Tantras in the Vast in the mid–14 century DR. Those who didnt enjoy it disparaged it as silvermuck.
Locally caught fish were spiced and pickled to make finefish. This was barreled in Tantras then exported across Faerûn, as one of the citys major products.
