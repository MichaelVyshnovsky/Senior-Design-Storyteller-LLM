        "mainbody": "A '''''cloak of guarding''''' was an enchanted item that protected the wearer from harm.",
        "Description": "This magical [[cloak]] appeared to be a regular heavy woolen cloak.",
        "Powers": "When physically struck, a ''cloak of guarding'' would instantly harden at the point of contact, deflecting [[arrow]]s and other missiles, and negating some of the force of all melee weapons. The cloak would revert to its normal flexible state as soon as the strike was over. A ''cloak of guarding'' could not be harmed by any weaponry.\n\nThe cloak would also protect the wearer for a period of time if crushed on all sides. It would disintegrate into nothing when it could no longer absorb the crushing pressure.\n\nThe downside of wearing a ''cloak of guarding'' was that the wearer would experience maximum harm from any fire, cold, or electrical-based attacks."
