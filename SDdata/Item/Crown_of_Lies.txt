The '''''Crown of Lies''''' was an [[artifact]] that granted its wearer the ability to perfectly transform into any seen creature. Additionally, any lies spoken while in the new form would appear as truth to both mundane and [[magical]] senses.

==Description==
The crown was crafted from burnished and intertwined metal rods.

==Powers==
In order to attune with the ''Crown of Lies'', its user should place it on their head and speak their heart's true desire.

The crown's wearer could assume the form and feel of any creature they'd seen, as long as the creature's size didn't deviate too far from the wearer's own size, generally within a range of half or double the wearer's size. No form of magical or mundane scrutiny would reveal details about the nature of the transformation, nor would it detect lies spoken as the new form. The crown would meld into the wearer's new form, thus rendering it undetectable. However, the wearer could choose to make the crown visible at will. The transformation would last until the wearer died, the attunement with the crown was broken, or the wearer used its powers to assume a new form.

The ''Crown of Lies'' would be permanently destroyed if the wearer was killed by the creature they were transformed into.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Kas]], who found the crown in a hidden forge in the [[Shadowfell]].
