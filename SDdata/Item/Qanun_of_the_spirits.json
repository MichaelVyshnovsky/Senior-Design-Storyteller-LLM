        "mainbody": "The '''''qanun of the spirits''''' was a beautiful magical [[qanun|musical instrument]] that was presented to the high chieftain of the [[jann of the High Desert]] on his ascension day.{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}\n\nEach new [[jann]] chieftain received a full set of magical instruments known collectively as the [[instruments of the jann]], so there were multiple ''[[qanun]]s of the spirits'' scattered throughout the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]].",
        "Description": "This fine instrument was made from select mahogany from the [[Afyal|Isle of the Elephant]]. Rumors abounded that the strings were made of thin [[gold cloth|spun gold]] or even solidified light. A pick carved from a precious [[emerald]] was used to play the instrument.",
        "Powers": "The ''qanun of the spirits ''was considered to be the most powerful item of all the instruments of the jann. When played, the musician effectively cast the ''[[fire truth]]'' spell. The tone of the instrument determined if the target was telling the truth, with sour notes indicating a lie. This power could be used once per day, though [[bard]]s and ''[[rawunin]]'' could use it twice per day.\n\nAdditionally, bards and ''rawunin'' could \"call the ancestors\", granting them the ability to ''[[speak with dead]]'' and even to ''[[animate dead]]'' as if they were a powerful priest. This power could be used once per week."
