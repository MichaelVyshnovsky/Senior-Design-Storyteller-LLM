'''Mixed coffee''' was a common type of a [[kaeth]] beverage served in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Western Heartlands]], and the [[West Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The drink was a blend of a bitter but enlivening kaeth and a soothing [[milk]] [[tea]]. This drink was a popular libation sold at grand city plazas during musical performances.
