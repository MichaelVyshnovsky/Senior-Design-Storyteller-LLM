Mixed coffee was a common type of a kaeth beverage served in the city of Baldurs Gate, the Western Heartlands, and the West Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR.
The drink was a blend of a bitter but enlivening kaeth and a soothing milk tea. This drink was a popular libation sold at grand city plazas during musical performances.
