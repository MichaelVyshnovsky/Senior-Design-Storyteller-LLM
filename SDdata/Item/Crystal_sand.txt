'''''Crystal sand''''' was a [[magical sand]] found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, used to create crystalline objects of virtually any shape.{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}}

==Powers==
Items created with ''crystal sand'' could weigh up to five lbs. (2.3 kg) per handful of sand used. Any item created in this manner was durable and as hard as steel. Any weapon created with ''crystal sand'' was sharper and easier to use than comparable non-magical weapons.

In order to create an object the ''crystal sand'' needed to be poured onto a flat surface in roughly the shape of the desired item. The name of the item was then spoken aloud and the desired item would form from the sand. Items created in this manner lasted for one full hour before shattering, damaging anything within a 10 foot (3 m) radius.
