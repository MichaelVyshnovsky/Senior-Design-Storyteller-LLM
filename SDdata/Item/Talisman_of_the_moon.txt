The '''''talisman of the moon''''' was a rare and powerful [[cleric]] item used by the followers of [[Corellon Larethian]], found in [[Waterdeep]], ''circa'' late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''talisman of the moon'' was a silvery-metallic disc with images of two crescents facing away from each other. The [[amulet]] was embedded with four small blue [[gem]] with a greater round gem in its middle.

==Powers==
''Talisman of the moon'' channeled the powers of the waning or waxing moon and bestowed Corellon's healing blessing on the wearer as long as they battled the powers of darkness. The amulet's magic surrounded the user and his four allies in a ''[[circle of protection]]'', which greatly improved their defenses and cured any negative magical effects they might be suffering from.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: a [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
