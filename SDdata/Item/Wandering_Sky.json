        "mainbody": "The '''''Wandering Sky''''' was a unique legendary [[enchanted]] [[greatsword]] once wielded by [[Hreidgar]] of the [[Tribe of the Bear]] with its story often retold by [[skald]]s of the [[Reghedmen]].",
        "Powers": "Simple in its design, the ''Wandering Sky'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that made its blows stronger and more precise. Additionally, the wielder could channel the great swords magics to cast the ''[[doom]]'' [[spell]] once per day.",
        "History": "The saga of the ''Wandering Sky'' was famous among the Reghedmen of the north as a tale of hearth and home, advertising the strength of [[barbarian]] spirit. The story of the blade began with the [[Arakon]] the Arch-Mage's conquest of [[Icewind Dale]], many centuries before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]]. The stout Reghedmen Tribe of the Bear was among the first to clash with the Arch-Mage's legions. The barbarian warriors fought bravely but were overwhelmed. Hreidgar, one of the Tribe of the Bear's strongest warriors and hunters, survived the clash after being knocked unconscious. When he came to it, Hreidgar was surrounded by the broken bodies of his tribesmen and ice-cold rain plastering the battlefield. Unable to find his wife and children, Hreidgar followed Arakon's legions with only the ''Wandering Sky'' greatsword at his side.\n\nHreidgar subsequently joined the army of the legendary [[shaman]] [[Jerrod]], who united barbarian Reghedmen and [[Uthgardt]] tribes against Arakon the Arch-Mage. With Jerrod's armies, Hreidgar wielded ''Wandering Sky'' in countless battles and in the historic clash against Arakon's summoned [[Nine Hells]] armies. The ''Wandering Sky'' howled like the wind, cutting down Hreidgar's enemies until Arakon's crusade was broken. Yet no signs of Hreidgar's family ever surfaced.\n\nThe greatsword accompanied Hreidgar's search for his missing family for many years following Arakon's defeat, across the [[Reghed Glacier]] during the [[Season of Raining Spears]], and across the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], with the sea-fairing [[Tribe of the Great Whale]]. The ''Wandering Sky'' cut down through southern slavers as the barbarian traveled to the town of [[Enholm's Point]], where the greatsword was wielded against the armies of [[Kresselack]] the Black Wolf. Legends claimed that Hreidgar fought so valiantly that the warlord retreated from Enholm's Point and the field of battle after dealing Hreidgar a grave injury.\n\nSkald sang of gravely wounded Hreidgar traveling for many miles with only his greatsword at his side before he collapsed and died of his injuries. With his final ounces of strength and dying breath, the barbarian plunged the sword into ice and uttered, \"Let the sky wander, for my travels are done.\" The next day, good folk from the village of Enholm's Point came to claim the hero's body, but the ''Wandering Sky'' was gone.\n\nLegends said that the ''Wandering Sky'' did just that, wandered the skies and found its way into the hands of those embarking on long and dangerous journeys.\n\nSometime before [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Wandering Sky'' found its way to the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]]. The greatsword ended up being available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in her trading company's store in [[Targos]] the same year."
