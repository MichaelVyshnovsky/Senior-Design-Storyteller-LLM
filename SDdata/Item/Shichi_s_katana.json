Moreover, it was a holy sword: in the hands of a paladin and unsheathed, it emanated a \"circle of power\" {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide that dispelled all lesser hostile magic.",
        "History": "Along with [[Shichi's daikyu|a daikyu]], the sword was enchanted and gifted to Shichi by the Grand Master of Flowers when she departed the [[Seven Roses Monastery]] in Pe Nok to become a \"walking initiate\"."
