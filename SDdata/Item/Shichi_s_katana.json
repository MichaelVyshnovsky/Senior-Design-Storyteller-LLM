Moreover, it was a holy sword in the hands of a paladin and unsheathed, it emanated a \"circle of power\"  wide that dispelled all lesser hostile magic.\nAlong with a daikyu, the sword was enchanted and gifted to Shichi by the Grand Master of Flowers when she departed the Seven Roses Monastery in Pe Nok to become a \"walking initiate\"."
