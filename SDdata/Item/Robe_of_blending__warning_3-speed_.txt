The robe of blending (warning 3-speed) was a magical item, robe, and worse invented by the mage Nimrod of Nump of the Misbegotten Realms.
Apparently a normal robe in all respects, its clasp possessed a sliding switch with four settings off, chop, mix, and liquefy.
The wearer blended into the environment, ground, and indeed air to a degree defined by each speed setting.
