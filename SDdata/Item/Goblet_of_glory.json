        "mainbody": "goblet of glory was an enchanted golden goblet that bestowed different effects upon those who imbibed from it depending upon how experienced of adventurer they were.\nOnce per day, whenever the rim of a goblet of glory was brought up to a holders lips and tilted it would dispense a clear, glowing liquid. It was impossible for this liquid to be spilled out or extracted in any other way than drinking it, with the goblet otherwise appearing empty. Each goblet of glory could provide around 3 to 36 draughts. Upon reaching their limit, a goblet would crumble into dust.\nFor an unremarkable adventurer this liquid would permanently heal minor wounds, cause them to physically grow  taller, and temporarily bestow an increase in life energy akin to a potion of super-heroism, thus boosting their combat prowess. For an adventurer that was already exceptional, this liquid would merely provide a permanent healing of minor wounds and drain away some of their life energy. These effects lasted for a duration of 4 to 16 minutes."
