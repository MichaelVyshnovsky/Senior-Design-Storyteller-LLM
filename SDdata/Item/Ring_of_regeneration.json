        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of regeneration''''' was a [[magic]] [[ring]] that gradually and continuously healed the wounds of its wearer.",
        "Powers": "Every ten minutes, the ''ring of regeneration'' emitted a burst of recuperative magic, restoring part of the health of its attuned wearer. It was also capable of regenerating lost limbs, in a process that took a few days.",
        "Creation": "The [[Imaskar]]ran arcane knowledge book, the ''[[Tome of the Ring]]'' had a crafting recipe for a ''ring of regeneration''. The recipe called for [[fenberry|fenberries]], an eye of a [[rakshasa]], and the spell of ''[[Melf's acid arrow]].<ref name=NWN>",
        "History": "Various ''rings of regeneration'' have been in existence since the glory days of the Imaskarran Empire. But one of the more modern versions was created by a lowly [[Red Wizard]] [[Huhhus]] who was not particularly talented in the ''art''. He discovered a method of distilling [[troll]] flesh into a ''[[potion of regeneration]]'', the liquid so foul, almost no-one was willing to ingest it. He considered that endeavor a failure. A few decades later, one of Huhhus' students used the master's research to craft a magic ring that incorporated troll's ichor and brain. As no-one needed to ingest gross troll-liquid, this ''ring of regeneration'' recipe was a success.<ref name=NWN />\n\nIn late 14{{th}} century DR, the ''rings of regeneration'' could often be purchased from vendors and good-aligned temples across the cities of the [[Sword Coast]], including [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]].<ref name=NWN /><ref name=NWNdod>"
