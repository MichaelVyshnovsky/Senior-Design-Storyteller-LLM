        "mainbody": "-century DR.\nA ring of regeneration was a magic ring that gradually and continuously healed the wounds of its wearer.\nEvery ten minutes, the ring of regeneration emitted a burst of recuperative magic, restoring part of the health of its attuned wearer. It was also capable of regenerating lost limbs, in a process that took a few days.\nThe Imaskarran arcane knowledge book, the Tome of the Ring had a crafting recipe for a ring of regeneration. The recipe called for fenberries, an eye of a rakshasa, and the spell of Melfs acid arrow.\nVarious rings of regeneration have been in existence since the glory days of the Imaskarran Empire. But one of the more modern versions was created by a lowly Red Wizard Huhhus who was not particularly talented in the art. He discovered a method of distilling troll flesh into a potion of regeneration, the liquid so foul, almost no-one was willing to ingest it. He considered that endeavor a failure. A few decades later, one of Huhhus students used the masters research to craft a magic ring that incorporated trolls ichor and brain. As no-one needed to ingest gross troll-liquid, this ring of regeneration recipe was a success.\nIn late 14 century DR, the rings of regeneration could often be purchased from vendors and good-aligned temples across the cities of the Sword Coast, including Neverwinter and Daggerford."
