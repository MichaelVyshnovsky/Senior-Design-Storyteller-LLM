The '''''Monarch's Scepter''''' was a unique ''[[rod of absorption]]'' that served as part of the regalia of the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]], beginning with the [[Rhindaun Dynasty]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. During the reign of [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|King-Consort Haedrak Rhindaun III]] and [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun]], it was nearly always kept by one of the monarchs when they held court, typically serving as sign of rulership, particularly for the Queen. 

==Description==
The ''Monarch's Scepter'' was a 3'-long (0.9 m) rod of pure [[silver]], whose forward-oriented end was shaped to look like the head of a roaring [[lion]]. The eyes of the beast were inset with [[diamond]]s.

==Powers==
Unlike most ''rods of absorption'', the ''Monarch's Scepter'' had no limit to the number of [[spell]]s it could absorb. However, it was created with defense in mind, only absorbing the [[arcane]] energy, rather than transferring it to the wielder. When it was used, the ''scepter'' would highlight the caster of the spell with ''[[faerie fire]]'', clearly identifying them to the wielder.

It was crafted so that it would only work for Haedrak and could be keyed for two other people of his choosing. He designated his wife, Queen Zaranda, and their [[Perendra Raslemtar|Court Vizera, Perendra]].

==History==
The [[magic]]al rod was crafted by [[Elminster Aumar]], many years before the coronation of Queen Zaranda Star and King-Consort Haedrak Rhindaun III. In [[1369 DR]], he brought the ''Monarch's Scepter'' with him, along with other magical items, when he traveled from [[Shadowdale]], to [[Waterdeep]] and finally Tethyr, where he pledged his support to Countess Zaranda Star.
