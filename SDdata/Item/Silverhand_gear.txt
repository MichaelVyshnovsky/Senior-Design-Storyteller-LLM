Silverhand gear referred to several weapons, armor pieces, and other magic items crafted by Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, in the late 15 century DR. This equipment was given to adventurers who fought to protect Waterdeep.
Laeral made Silverhand gear for those who had proven themselves as heroes to Waterdeep.In the Warriors of Waterdeep game, Silverhand gear was earned in contests called "Silverhand Trials". Each piece of Silverhand gear was personalized for the adventurer to whom it was given, and the enchantments were always at least somewhat unique and selected by Laeral to represent or complement some strength, talent, or motivation of the recipient.
In addition to weapons and armor, Laeral crafted seals small tokens, medallions, or trinkets with symbolic meaning and potent magic.
