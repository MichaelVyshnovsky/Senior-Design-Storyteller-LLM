'''''Silverhand gear''''' referred to several [[:Category:Weapons|weapons]], [[:Category:Armor|armor pieces]], and other [[magic items]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. This equipment was given to [[adventurer]]s who fought to protect Waterdeep.

==Description==
Laeral made ''Silverhand gear'' for those who had proven themselves as heroes to Waterdeep.In the ''[[Warriors of Waterdeep]]'' game, ''Silverhand gear'' was earned in contests called "Silverhand Trials". Each piece of ''Silverhand gear'' was personalized for the adventurer to whom it was given, and the [[enchantment]]s were always at least somewhat unique and selected by Laeral to represent or complement some strength, talent, or motivation of the recipient.

In addition to weapons and armor, Laeral crafted '''''[[Silverhand gear#Seals|seals]]''''': small tokens, medallions, or trinkets with symbolic meaning and potent [[magic]].
