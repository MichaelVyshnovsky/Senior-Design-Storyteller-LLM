'''Moon Mountain Ale''' was the primary product of the [[Moon Mountain Brewery]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|81}}

==Description==
Fully two-thirds of the quantity of beverages that came from the Moon Mountain Brewery, this ale was clear and light, made from [[barley]], hops, and the waters of the [[Unicorn Run]],{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80}}

==Reputation==
This drink was popular in [[Daggerford]], [[Llorkh]], [[Loudwater]], and [[Secomber]], where it was sold by the keg. Outside of this corridor along the [[Delimbiyr]], it was mostly sold in [[topkeg]]s for making [[ale flip]]s.

==History==
The recipe and method for brewing this beverage belonged to [[Mrune Moontan]], a [[half-elf]] [[sorceress]] that married [[Oblar Minstrelwish]], a [[halfling]] adventurer. The "Moon Mountain" moniker was from the mispronunciation of her name.
