        "mainbody": "elms of heroes were enchanted helmets that offered limited protection to the wearer, popularized in the 15 century DR.\nHelms of heroes slightly improved the wearers protection against mundane and magical dangers, as well as spell effects. The enchantments also made the helmets bright and shiny, never needing a polish.\nIn the 15 century DR, various helms of heroes could be found among bandits and heroes of the Sword Coast, areas surrounding the city of Neverwinter."
