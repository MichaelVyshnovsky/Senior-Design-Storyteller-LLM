'''Bloodstone''' was a [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] found mostly in [[northeast Faerûn]], especially the [[Galena Mountains]] between [[Damara]] and [[Vaasa]]. Ninety percent of the bloodstone mined in [[Faerûn]] came from this area, known as the [[Bloodstone Lands]], and one particular [[Bloodstone Mines|mine]] produced the majority of the supply,  ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].

==Description==
Bloodstone was the ''Realms'' name for the mineral [[wikipedia:en:Heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], a deep green-gray [[chalcedony]] with inclusions of red [[jasper]] that looked like flecks of blood. When worn for adornment, it was usually cut cabochon, and either polished into smooth ovals or given beveled edges. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 [[gp]].

Historically, bloodstone was also sold in bars worth 25 gp, each with the stamp of a Damaran noble house on one side and the year in [[Marking_the_years#Impilturan_Calendar|Damaran Reckoning]] on the other.

==Powers==
One of the most important properties of bloodstone was as a medicinal agent similar to the [[herb]] [[bloodstaunch]]. When a bloodstone gem was pressed on an open wound, it caused the blood to coagulate, the wound to close, and any blood diseases or poisons to be removed. No health was restored, but further injury from blood loss was prevented. The gemstone dissolved upon conferring its benefits, and a being could only receive this treatment once in a lunar cycle, ''i.e.'', another such treatment would not be effective until a month had passed.

A bloodstone was one of the material components for the [[wu jen]] spell ''[[water to poison]]''. Bloodstones could also be used as a substitute spell component for most [[divination]] spells and magics that were related to storms. One gem and one sprig of the [[heliotrope]] herb worked as material components for the ''[[invisibility]]'' spell.

==History==
Damara was established as a kingdom in the [[1075 DR|Year of the Bronze Banner, 1075 DR]] and became a wealthy nation by trading their [[iron]], [[silver]], and bloodstone. After the sudden rise of [[Zhengyi]] the Witch-King in Vaasa and the subsequent invasion of Damara in the [[1348 DR|Year of the Spur, 1348 DR]], the trade bars were considered "cursed money" and lost much of their value. Once [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] took the throne in the [[1359 DR|Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], an era of relative peace and prosperity gave people faith in the currency of Damara and the reputation of the trade bars was on the mend by the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].

==Notable Bloodstones==
* Six matching bloodstones adorned the fabled sword [[Ilbratha]], Mistress of Battles.
* The [[lesser deity]] [[Iyachtu Xvim]] was known to occasionally send bloodstones to show favor or inspire his followers.
* A ''[[necklace of prayer beads]]'' was known to include bloodstones as inert decorative beads.{{Cite web/Princes of the Apocalypse Online Supplement|3}}
