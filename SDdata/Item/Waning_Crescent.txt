The Waning Crescent was a ceremonial sword used by the clerics of Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn.
The hilt of the sword was curved and forged from shining steel. It was decorated with mother-of-pearl and silver and etched with the symbol of a crescent inside a circle. The weapon was a twin to the Waxing Crescent.
The sword was functional but primarily ceremonial. It symbolized the office of the priest or priestess responsible for the internal administrative business of the temple, one of the most honorable positions in the clergy.
The sword was carried by the priestess Velsinore in 1373 DR. She wore it somewhat awkwardly, but did so only because fellow priest Mifano wore the Waxing Crescent openly and they were competing for influence under High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar.
