        "mainbody": "'''Clouts''' were [[:category:undergarments|undergaments]] worn by most folks of the [[Realms]]. They were made of a tight [[belt]] worn around the hips, and of a long strip of cloth passed between the legs, slipped in the belt on the front and back of the body, and left to dangle.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/02-20 - Lingerie, Courtship and Foreplay}}",
        "Description": "The belt of the clouts could be manufactured from various different materials: the most durable were made of [[leather]], but cheaper alternatives could be made of cloth or even cord. They were usually closed on the front using small hooks.\n\nThe strip of cloth passed between the legs was made of fabric, usually [[cotton]]. The dangling ends were often designed to be tied together, and was folded on itself by [[horse]] riders to provide additional padding and absorbancy.\n\nWhile most clouts were basic undergarments, some were decorative, made \"to be seen\", or even sold freshly-[[perfume]]d. Such novelty items could be found in big cities such as [[Waterdeep]]."
