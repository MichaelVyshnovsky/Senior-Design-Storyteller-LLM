        "mainbody": "A Waukeens Defender was a variety of enchanted shield wielded by the Waukeenar clergy across Faerûn.\nA Waukeens Defender was decorated with the golden visage of the goddess Waukeen herself.\nThese shields were enchanted with a potent +2 magic that increased the wielders protection and offered additional protection from missiles. The shields magics were woven in such a manner that they retained the enchantments only as long as the image of Waukeen on the front was uncovered and unaltered. If the owner did not follow these instructions, a Waukeens Defender lost all of its magic.\nWaukeens Defenders first appeared in circulation some years before . They were crafted by temples dedicated to the Merchants Friend all across Faerûn and sold to clever adventurers, who were instructed to show the image of Waukeen everywhere they went in exchange for the shields magical protection. One such shield was in the hands of Quinn Silverfinger, a cleric of Waukeen in the Golden Lodge of Lonelywood."
