        "mainbody": "A '''''Waukeen's Defender''''' was a variety of [[enchanted]] [[shield]] wielded by the [[Waukeenar]] clergy across [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "A ''Waukeen's Defender'' was decorated with the [[gold]]en visage of the goddess [[Waukeen]] herself.",
        "Powers": "These shields were enchanted with a potent ''+2'' magic that increased the wielder's protection and offered additional protection from missiles. The shields' magics were woven in such a manner that they retained the enchantments only as long as the image of Waukeen on the front was uncovered and unaltered. If the owner did not follow these instructions, a ''Waukeen's Defender'' lost all of its magic.",
        "History": "''Waukeen's Defenders'' first appeared in circulation some years before {{Yearlink|1281}}. They were crafted by temples dedicated to the Merchant's Friend all across Faerûn and sold to clever [[adventurer]]s, who were instructed to show the image of Waukeen everywhere they went in exchange for the shields' magical protection. One such shield was in the hands of [[Quinn Silverfinger]], a [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]] in the [[Golden Lodge]] of [[Lonelywood]]."
