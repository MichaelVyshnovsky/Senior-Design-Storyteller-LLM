        "mainbody": "Arknors Vile Voice was an enchanted ring that improved the wearers physical shape and muscle tone and a part of the Fading Rings set.\nArknors Vile Voice appeared as a regular ring that exuded strong pungent odor.\nWhen worn, Arknors Vile Voice improved strength and constitution as well as allowed the spell of Melfs acid arrow to be cast.\nIn 1369 DR, Arknors Vile Voice came to be possessed by a mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head, located in the Nightingale Court in the ruins of Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the Arknors Vile Voice."
