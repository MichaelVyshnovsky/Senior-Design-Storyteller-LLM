        "Description": "This magical armor was made using [[lamellar]] armor.",
        "Powers": "Though it did not grant the wearer any additional protection compared to regular lamellar armor, the armor of the desert evening could be worn in the heat of the desert without causing any kind of additional discomfort to the wearer as other armor would when heated under the fierce burning sun.\n\nIt should be noted that this armor did not protect the wearer from dehydration or sun exposure. Instead, it did not increase these effects as other armor would.",
