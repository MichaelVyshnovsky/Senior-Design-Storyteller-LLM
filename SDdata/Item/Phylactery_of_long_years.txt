A phylactery of long years was a magic item that greatly slowed the natural aging process of the wearer.
This item would slow the natural aging process of the wearer by one quarter so long as it was worn. Thus if worn for a full year the wearer would only age nine months. A phylactery of long years would also slow magical aging.
A cursed version of this item existed that would have the opposite effectâ€“aging the wearer one quarter more than normal.
Tisan Balshareska, a dreaded Arch-Geomancer inhabiting Tadabbur within the Cities of the Ancients, wore a phylactery of long years.
