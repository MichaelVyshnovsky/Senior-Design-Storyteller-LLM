A '''''phylactery of long years''''' was a [[magic item]] that greatly slowed the natural aging process of the wearer.

==Powers==
This item would slow the natural aging process of the wearer by one quarter so long as it was worn. Thus if worn for a full year the wearer would only age nine months. A ''phylactery of long years'' would also slow magical aging.

A cursed version of this item existed that would have the opposite effectâ€“aging the wearer one quarter more than normal.

==Notable Owners==
[[Tisan Balshareska]], a dreaded Arch-Geomancer inhabiting [[Tadabbur]] within the [[Cities of the Ancients]], wore a ''phylactery of long years''.
