        "mainbody": "he belt of the witch king was an enchanted belt that once belonged to Zhengyi the Witch-King.This items lore is established in the Living Forgotten Realms adventure, Tyrannys Perilous Bastion. Note that the item backstory provided in Adventurers Vault 2 is different, and is non-canon for the Forgotten Realms.\nThe belt was a series of small obsidian spheres charged with arcane power, which were each connected to the next by a small silver link of chain.\nThe belt fortified the wearers endurance. If its wearer was an arcane spellcaster, it could leverage their magical power to heal them if they became seriously injured.\nThe belt of the witch king was kept in a secret compartment in the back of Zhengyis throne, alongside other treasures. It remained there for over a century after Zhengyis defeat at the hands of Gareth Dragonsbane."
