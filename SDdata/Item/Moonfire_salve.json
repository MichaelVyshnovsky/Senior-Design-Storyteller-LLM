        "mainbody": "A moonfire salve was a magical substance used by the church of Selûne.\nMoonfire salve was kept in a special jar the size of a flask and fashioned of a translucent white ceramic. The substance itself was semi-solid.\nMoonfire salve had different and distinct magical effects depending on how it was applied, whether poured, rubbed, or consumed. If poured over an item or rubbed on a creatures forehead, it functioned as a targeted dispel magic spell. If rubbed on the feet, it granted the power to fly, as the spell. If rubbed on the eyelids, it granted darkvision. If rubbed on the back of a hand, it allowed greater mage hand. If eaten, it worked as a cure serious wounds spell.\nFollowing an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, which created various magical items or bestowed blessings on the faithful, the residual moonfire fell inert, but was not without power. The clergy collected and bottled it, creating up to six jars of moonfire salve.\nIt was valued at 2,500 gold pieces. However, it was only gifted to people who had served the church in a significant way. Like moonfire, the clergy saw moonfire salve as a holy substance if stolen, they would go to extraordinary lengths to retrieve it."
