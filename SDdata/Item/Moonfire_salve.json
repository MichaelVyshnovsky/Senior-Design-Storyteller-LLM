        "mainbody": "A '''''moonfire salve''''' was a magical substance used by the [[church of Selûne]].",
        "Description": "''Moonfire salve'' was kept in a special [[jar]] the size of a [[flask]] and fashioned of a translucent white [[ceramic]]. The substance itself was semi-solid.",
        "Powers": "''Moonfire salve'' had different and distinct magical effects depending on how it was applied, whether poured, rubbed, or consumed. If poured over an item or rubbed on a creature's forehead, it functioned as a targeted ''[[dispel magic]]'' [[spell]]. If rubbed on the feet, it granted the power to [[fly]], as the spell. If rubbed on the eyelids, it granted ''[[darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]''. If rubbed on the back of a hand, it allowed ''[[greater mage hand]]''. If eaten, it worked as a ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' spell.",
        "Creation": "Following an appearance of ''[[moonfire]]'' at a Selûnite ritual, which created various magical items or bestowed blessings on the faithful, the residual ''moonfire'' fell inert, but was not without power. The clergy collected and bottled it, creating up to six jars of ''moonfire salve''.",
        "Value": "It was valued at 2,500 [[gold piece]]s. However, it was only gifted to people who had served the church in a significant way. Like ''moonfire'', the clergy saw ''moonfire salve'' as a holy substance; if stolen, they would go to extraordinary lengths to retrieve it."
