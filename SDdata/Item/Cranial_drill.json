        "mainbody": "A cranial drill was a surgical tool used to make a hole in a persons skull, or possibly just in wood.\nIt was used to drill a hole in a patients skull to release cranial pressure and thus alleviate persistent and extreme headaches or madness. This should of course only be performed by a skilled surgeon with a steady hand, or a carpenter in a pinch. This was not without risk it could deteriorate the patients mental capacity, do nothing, or even actually relieve the symptoms. And if there was a slip, it could kill the patient, but at least the condition would be cured. While some were understandably dubious of the benefit and safety of this, others swore it was effective, occasionally.\nOnly one model of cranial drill was sold through Auroras Emporium and the Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. It had a gnome-crafted ratchet mechanism and a robust iron construction, and was valued at only 10 gp.\nAt Bryn Goldtooths shop in Ghars, Cormyr, circa 1367 DR, there was once offered for sale a variety of cranial drills (used)."
