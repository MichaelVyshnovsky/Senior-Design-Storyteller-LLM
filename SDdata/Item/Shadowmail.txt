'''''Shadowmail''''' was a special set of [[scale armor]] found in the [[Blooded Wood]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The mail was mostly black and bore a large white skull design on the chest.

==Powers==
Though a fairly large suit of mail, it was specially designed by the [[eladrin]] to be lighter and not impede spellcasting. It also carried powerful enhancements to certain destructive elemental styles of magic, making it ideal for a flashy spellcaster.

==History==
The armor was in the 'possession' (sans wearer) of the [[giant spider]] [[Greenstalker]], who had laired near [[Granwell Keep]] in the [[King's Forest]]. It may have been found by [[Harpers]] looking for the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' held by the [[Shadovar]] [[arcanist]]s in the Keep.
