Reliance was the enchanted dagger that belonged to a halfling warrior Ket Stillpond who was the inspiration for the ballad called The One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen.
Reliance possessed a +4 enchantment.
Long before 1281 DR, Reliance and an enchanted short sword Bloodfarmer, never left the side of their famous master, warrior Ket "the Keen" Stillpond. The halfling was obsessed with keeping the dagger on his person at all times, something that reportedly resulted in him being kicked out of Cormyrean royal court. Unbound weapons were not allowed by the tradition and the laws of the Forest Kingdom. After Kets death, his family donated Reliance to the Church of Arvoreen. Subsequently, the church passed the enchanted dagger to a promising young halfling warrior. However, Reliance did not say with the warrior for long as a pack of bandits murdered him after the halfling foolishly and naively left the dagger with guards of a seemingly friendly camp.
By 1281 DR, Reliance ended up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar.
