Darughts, also known as checkers, was a board game and "one of the four universal games" of Faerûn along with chess, dice, and Talis.
Draughts was played on the same 8&times8 checkered board as chess, but draughts was a much simpler game to learn and faster to play. It contained 24 pieces of two colors.
Sets in Faerûn often contained pieces made of clay or stone with a wooden board in a wooden case. Auroras Emporium sold a more expensive set with red and black stone pieces.
