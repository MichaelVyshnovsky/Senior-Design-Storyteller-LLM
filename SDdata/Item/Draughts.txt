'''Darughts''', also known as '''checkers''', was a board game and "one of the four universal games" of [[Faerûn]] along with [[Chess (game)|chess]], [[dice]], and [[Talis]].

==Description==
Draughts was played on the same 8&times;8 checkered board as chess, but draughts was a much simpler game to learn and faster to play. It contained 24 pieces of two colors.

Sets in Faerûn often contained pieces made of clay or stone with a wooden board in a wooden case. [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold a more expensive set with red and black stone pieces.
