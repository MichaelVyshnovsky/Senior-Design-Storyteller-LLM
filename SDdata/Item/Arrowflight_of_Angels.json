        "mainbody": "'''''Arrowflight of Angels''''' was an [[elf|elven]] enchanted [[longbow]] that once belonged to an [[Akh'Velahr]] war party leader, [[Victoria]], who died in the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Description": "''Arrowflight of Angels'' was a delicately crafted elven bow decorated with [[angel]] wings.",
        "Powers": "Victoria's bow possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment and increased the user's constitution. ''Arrowflight of Angels'' gave the user ability to cast ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]''.",
        "History": "During the Weeping War, Victoria led her elven war party against the invading [[Army of Darkness]] and met her demise in the [[Elven Catacombs]]. In [[1369 DR]], the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] were smuggling elven artifacts from the catacombs under the city and Victoria's gear was among the items that were collected and prepared for transport. ''Arrowflight of Angels'' never reached the [[Underdark]] as a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] destroyed drow operations in the Elven Catacombs."
