This blade was commissioned by an unnamed Shogun to symbolize his rule. However, the weapon makes outdid himself and fell in love with the most beautiful blade hes ever created. Anukiru could not part with the katana he named the Steel Blossom. Maddened by the smiths dishonor, the Shogun beheaded Anukiru with the Steel Blossom and reclaimed his commission. It was believed that the enchanted katana did not stay with its new master for long as he was killed in battle soon after.\nThe Steel Blossoms history remained vague after the fall of the Shogun, and the sword did not resurface again until the late 14 century DR. The Blossom was exported out of Kozakura and was sold at Okuzos Imports of Westgate."
