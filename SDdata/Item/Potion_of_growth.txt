A '''''potion of growth''''' was a magical [[potion]] that caused its drinker to temporarily grow to enormous size.

==Description==
''Potions of growth'' were clear in color, with a small red bead suspended in the liquid that repeatedly expanded to color the entire contents of its [[vial]] and contracted again. This effect happened continuously and not even shaking the vial interrupted it.

==Powers==
Upon drinking a ''potion of growth'', the user gained the effects of an ''[[Enlarge or reduce person|enlarge/reduce]]'' spell for a duration of between one and four hours.

==Variants==
;''Paste of growth'': The people of [[Serôs]] had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion,<ref>{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|77}} suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a ''paste of growth'' consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either [[clam]]shells or flexible tubes made from [[eel]]skin.<ref>
