        "mainbody": "'''''Golden chalice of Lathander''''' was an enchanted [[gold]] chalice imbued with [[Lathander]]'s divine magic.",
        "Description": "The ''chalices of Lathander'' were finely crafted out of pure gold and were decorated or engraved with symbols of a sun rising on a [[rose]] in full bloom.",
        "Powers": "Upon the use of the ''chalice's'' command word, the item started shedding bright light, similar to that of the ''[[light]]'' spell. The light ability of the chalice could be activated any number times a day and it did not consume one of the item's three charges. The activation of the ''chalice's'' ''[[healing circle]]'' spell, on the other hand, consumed one of its charges. When all three charges had been expended, the chalice still retained its ''light''-giving magic.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], a ''golden chalice of Lathander'' could be received in exchange for a grand donation from the temple of [[Lathander]], [[Moonglow Tower]], in [[Daggerford]].\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], a ''golden chalice of Lathander'' could be purchased in the [[Blacklake District]]'s temple of Lathander in [[Neverwinter]]. Another ''chalice'' could be found in the ruined temple in the swamps outside [[West Harbor]]."
