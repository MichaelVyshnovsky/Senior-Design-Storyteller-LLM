Drums were a group of percussion instruments dating back a very long way 
All drums were characterized by a membrane, usually made of skin, This would be stretched tightly over some kind of hollow resonating body, such as a pot or wooden cylinder, in order to create sound.
Known varieties were kettledrums, side drums, bass drums, gong drums, bongos, tom-toms, cylinder drums, the changoo, talking drums, slit drums Special variants used in Zakhara were tapered drums or darbukkah, elephant drums, jahlah, the naqqarah, qasah baladi, and the tabl. The Iulutiuns had a drum called kilat made of a sealskin over a circle of wood or bone.
Exotic bongo drums were used on the Malatran Plateau. They were constructed using giraffe skin.
Drums were considered a popular instrument among a wide variety of races and cultures. Especially dwarves, orcs, and other creatures that dwelled underground. For smaller races, such as goblins and halflings, bongos were typically the preferred form of drum due to their portability. Celestials and elves however, generally felt distaste towards drums.
