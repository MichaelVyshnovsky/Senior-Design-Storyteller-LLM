In addition to its +4 enchantment the Dagger of the Star had a rather unique magical property every time the weapon struck, there was a chance its wielder would disappear from sight for an entire minute.
The imp Cespenar was aware of the weapon and knew it could be further enchanted, a process that would involve five star sapphires being embedded into its hilt.
As of the , the Dagger of the Star was interred within a crypt within the fourth level of Watchers Keep in Tethyr.
Due to its unique magical properties, the dagger was favored by a number of assassins.
According to legend, the weapon first came to Toril when it was dropped by one of the pantheons lesser deities.
