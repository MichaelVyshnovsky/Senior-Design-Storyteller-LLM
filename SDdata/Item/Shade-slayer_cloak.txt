The cloak's wearer could dispense especially deadly and well-aimed attacks from the shadows with a greater ease, making even the worst [[assassin]]s into the deadliest opponents.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''shade-slayer cloak'' belonged to the youth merchant named [[Sticky Dondo]], a member of [[Fetcher's Brats]] and the infamous criminal organization of [[Baldur's Gate]] â€“ [[The Guild]].
