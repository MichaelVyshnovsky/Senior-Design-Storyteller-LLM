A '''map''' was a document displaying the layout of a region, such as a building, settlement, landscape, country, continent, or world.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}

{{Quote|The real romance lies in mapping lands untrodden by civilized men. Only rabble follow maps.|[[Hamnet Hawklin]]<ref>}}

==Manufacture & Design==
Many of the maps available in the Realms were simplified copies of maps from the large collections of courts, temples, and private individuals. They were made by limners (painters or portrait drawers), [[court herald]]s, and scribes who had to pay an access fee, sometimes per map. This fee covered the time involved for someone to bring them the map and watch over them as they worked. This fee also tended to be roughly half or a third of the price that the scribe would charge their client for the finished copy.

Maps were often printed on [[scroll]]s that could be rolled up, and stored in a map tube or [[scrollcase|map case]].<ref>
[[File:Map B&M.jpg|thumb|A map of part of the Utter East.]]
Nautical maps—which were typically the most crude and inaccurate, yet most valuable of maps—were often drawn by sea captains themselves. This was done by using a candle or burning quill to singe markings into the cured, durable hide of a [[cow|bull]]. Often they drew these while consulting the map of another captain, who watched over their work and charged them a stiff fee.

Just as there existed these charts for the oceans of Toril that ships relied upon, there existed [[w:c:spelljammer:star chart|star charts]] that [[spelljammer]]s relied upon. These were navigational charts for [[crystal sphere]]s and the [[phlogiston]] and were considered necessary to have if one wished to navigate the skyways accurately.<ref>

Stores that sold traveling supplies, such as [[Elgath's Provisions]] in [[Archenbridge]], often sold maps,<ref> while some shops like [[Maskado's Maps & Legends]] in [[Neverwinter]] and [[Esklindrar's Maps, Books, & Folios]] in [[Yartar]] specialized in maps, [[book]]s, and other records of information.
<ref><ref><ref>
* [[Blingdenstone]]'s royal vaults held rough maps that outlined the many passageways in and out of the city. The city's [[deep gnome]] inhabitants never allowed outsiders to purchase or borrow copies of these maps.
* The store [[Frozenfar Expeditions]] sold maps of the surrounding [[Icewind Dale]] region.
* The [[Horizon's Sails]] was a business in [[Waterdeep]] that sold a variety of high quality and rare maps, including ones that were [[enchanted]].
* The [[Map House]] in [[Silverymoon]], maintained by the [[Heralds of Faerûn]], held a great library of maps.<ref> Other places in Silverymoon that were considered to have some of the best map collections in the Realms included—the [[Halls of Inspiration]], the [[Star Court]], and various vaults beneath the [[High Palace]].
* The similarly named [[Map House (Waterdeep)|Map House]] of Waterdeep, the guildhall of the [[Surveyors', Map & Chart-Makers' Guild]], both sold and purchased maps and nautical charts.
* The [[Mapper's Workshop]], an obscure shop in [[Ravens Bluff]], sold maps of places all across Faerûn. It also stocked a few maps of various countries that existed on the world of [[Oerth]], particularly those that neighbored the city-state of [[w:c:greyhawk:Greyhawk|Greyhawk]].{{Cite polyhedron/62/The Living City: The Mapper's Workshop|27}} Its proprietor sometimes hired adventurers to explore areas of his maps that he considered to be under-detailed.
* [[Nautical Charts of Bral]] was a shop on the [[Rock of Bral]] that sold starcharts for the crystal spheres that were nearby [[Realmspace]].<ref>
* In Neverwinter, one could purchase both maps and nautical charts from the shop of [[Alasturan Malatheer]], though they often had fanciful errors to them.<ref>{{Cite dragon/239/Wyrms of the North: Galadaeros|33}}
* [[Nightstar Guiding and Outfitters]] was a general store in [[Waymoot]] that sold maps.
* [[Old Winding Road Maps and Charts]] was an old store in Waterdeep that specialized in maps and nautical charts.{{Cite web/Realmslore/Dawntree, Part Two: First Flowerings}}
* [[Safe Harbor Marine Guarantees]], a maritime insurance business in Ravens Bluff, also sold nautical charts of both the [[Inner Sea]] and [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].
* [[The Sailors' Own]], a tavern in the city of Waterdeep, offered patrons nautical charts of areas along the [[Sword Coast]] and around the [[Sea of Swords]].
* [[Serpent Books & Folios]] in Waterdeep was considered by some to be one of the single best sources for maps and nautical charts in the Realms, including maps of the Sword Coast.<ref>
* [[Summarl's Scrolls and Maps]], a shop in the city of [[Calimport]].
===Religious Sources===
* The [[House of the Moon]], a temple of [[Selûne]] in the city of Waterdeep, had a grand Hall of Maps that held maps of nearly every known city and land in the continent of Faerûn. These were stored on crammed shelves lengthwise within unlabled, ornate tubes of bone and [[ivory]]. Among the collection there were even a few prized maps of [[Maztica]], [[Kara-tur]], and [[Zakhara]]. Though the collection lacked maps of [[Eltabbar]], [[Evermeet]], and Neverwinter.<ref> Merchants and ship captains often visited when planning new expeditions, while adventurers, hunters, and guides visited when seeking out lost trails through nigh-impassable obstacles.<ref>
* Many temples of [[Oghma]] sold maps to support themselves.<ref>
* Many of the [[Church of Shaundakul]]'s [[priest]]s made a living selling accurate-as-possible maps of trade routes, mountain passes, and even the layouts of castles and palaces with their (known) secret rooms and passages marked. They were also known to sell maps of short underground routes, such as [[sewer system]]s, catacombs, the cellars of ruins, and “merchants’ shortcuts” in the Underdark.<ref>

==Uses==
Maps helped people find their way between locations, whether in a wilderness environment or in a dungeon.

Maps were useful in warfare. In the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]), scroll maps surveying charts were sought after to reveal unexplored areas and dispel the "fog of war". Maps of [[Neverwinter]] were forbidden to be made in an effort to thwart [[Luskan]] spies.<ref>

In the [[tenday]] preceding the city holiday of [[Wintershield]], sales of maps in Waterdeep would increase as many sought to consult them for discussions of politics and warfare. Additionally, it was widely considered good luck to own and examine a map on that day.<ref>

==History==
[[File:HordeNomadMap.png|thumb|273px|''A [[Taan|Taangan]] nomad stands in the foreground of a rolled out map depicting the Taan, the eastern half of [[Faerûn]], and part of [[Kara-Tur]].'']]
The first recognized map of [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], and [[Cormanthor]] was made by Cormyrian cartographers in the {{YearlinkName|112}}.<ref>
 Called "[[The Map of the Lands of the Inner Sea]]", it was commissioned by an ancestor of [[Aubayreer Mindosel]] to mark the year of their ennobling in [[Teshar]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, explorers from [[New Waterdeep]] created inland survey maps of [[Maztica]].<ref>

Sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], several [[cloud giant]] nobles embarked on expeditions to remap the [[Sword Coast]], hoping to uncover lost relics of their ancient kingdom [[Ostoria]] along the way.
