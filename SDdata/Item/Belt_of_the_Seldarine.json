        "mainbody": "The belt of the Seldarine was an artifact dedicated to the elven pantheon, the Seldarine, and a part of a set of artifacts that powered each other as well as the wearer.\nThe belt of the Seldarine was a belt enchanted to be a proud and visible symbol of devotion to the Seldarine and the love of the elven deities of their mortal worshipers. The belt of the Seldarine and its more powerful version, the greater belt of the Seldarine, empowered its wearer, increasing their dexterity and charisma. Additionally, it boosted their physical power and skills of deflecting incoming blows and granted a slight ability to siphon their opponents vitality. When such a belt was worn in tandem with a cloak of the Seldarine and the emblem of the Seldarine, the set also increased the wearers health and toughness and healed a small part of each incoming blow.\nThe belt of the Seldarine was found in the hands of adventurers and defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR, during the Elemental Evil crisis and the rise of Tiamat through the Cult of the Dragons machinations all around northwest Faer√ªn."
