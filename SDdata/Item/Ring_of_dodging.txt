'''''Rings of dodging''''' were enchanted [[ring]]s that made their wearer quicker and more nimble.

==Description==
Some of these rings often were simple polished [[gold]]en bands that flickered with faint magical glimmer. Others were intricately decorated with an image of a golden [[hummingbird]] inlaid with [[jade]] and [[sapphire]]s.

==Powers==

''Rings of dodging'' possessed several enchantments. They increased the wearer's defense by the way of agility, increased their reflexes and dexterity, and made them move faster in the heat of battle.

Some versions of these rings had more limited scope. Only able to be activated three times per day, these rings only affected one opponent, making the wearer more nimble in combat against that creature, while other opponents remained unaffected. Additionally, this version of ''rings of dodging'' gave the wearer enhance ability to dodge and resist magical spells.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these rings were primarily found in the [[the Dalelands]], where most guilds often possessed one.<ref>{{Cite dragon/256/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Tools of the Trade|90}}

Another ''ring of dodging'' was acquired by the [[tressym]] named [[Tara]] for her friend [[Gale Dekarios]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
