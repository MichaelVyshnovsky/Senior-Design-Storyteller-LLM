'''''Chalsembyr's Heart''''' was a [[magic]]al [[greatsword]] central to the [[church of Torm|church]] of [[Torm]] the True, forged to guide [[paladin]]s who sought [[Chalsembyr]].

==Description==
''Chalsembyr's Heart'' was a finely crafted [[greatsword]] forged of [[cold iron]] and [[gold]], with a [[lion]] motif. The cross guards were shaped like lion's paws, and where they met the blade at the rain guard was an image of a lion's head, in profile on one side, face-on on the other. The hilt was bound in white [[leather]] and gold [[wire]]. Set into the pommel was a large, brilliant-cut white [[diamond]], circled by five rectangular [[Shou Lung topaz|fiery yellow]] [[corundum]]s. The cold iron blade was tinted with gold, with the words "Seek the High Seat Always" written in the [[Celestial language]] etched on both sides.

==History==
According to legend, [[Bertold|Bertold the Seeker]] was a [[paladin]] of Torm who embarked on the traditional quest to rediscover the lost kingdom of [[Chalsembyr]], the realm of the once-mortal Torm. To aid him in this endeavor, [[cleric]]s of the [[House of the Hand]] temple in [[Procampur]], [[the Vast]], forged ''Chalsembyr's Heart''. Bertold carried the sword with him on his journeys.

Finally, while crossing the [[Toadsquat Mountains]] of the southeastern [[Shaar]], Bertold was ambushed by [[ogre]]s and slain. He was unaware of his sword's soul binding power, however, and rather than go to the [[House of the Triad]], Bertold's soul went into ''Chalsembyr's Heart''.

There it would remain until another found and claimed the sword, to become the beneficiary of Bertold's knowledge and experience. However, the sword was lost after Bertold's death and not found by [[1374 DR]]. Many paladins of Torm sought it around [[Faer√ªn]].

The legend told that if another paladin wielded ''Chalsembyr's Heart'' and died, then the departing soul would also go into the sword, freeing Bertold to finally ascend to the [[afterlife]]. Thus each paladin would serve as a guide to the next one to seek Chalsembyr.

==Powers==
''Chalsembyr's Heart'' functioned similarly to a ''[[holy avenger]]'': though normally a ''+2 cold iron greatsword'', it became a ''+5 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] cold iron greatsword'' in the hands of a paladin. However, it lacked the ''holy avenger'''s other powers.

The sword was also intelligent, bearing the bound souls of its deceased wielders. Inhabited by Bertold the Seeker, this was a [[lawful good]], wise and charismatic soul, with the ability to see, listen, and read normally and able to communicate telepathically. It was knowledgeable in history with regards to Chalsembyr and in deciphering ancient and obscured writings. The sword's goal was to locate the lost kingdom of Chalsembyr.

The sword could be used to cast ''[[detect thoughts]]''  at will.

If wielded by a paladin of Torm who died, then ''Chalsembyr's Heart'' could absorb that person's soul and bind it within the sword, similar in effect to the spell ''[[soul bind]]'', albeit with benevolent purpose. The purpose of this was to preserve the knowledge and findings of those who sought Chalsembyr, so that they might be passed on to future seekers.
