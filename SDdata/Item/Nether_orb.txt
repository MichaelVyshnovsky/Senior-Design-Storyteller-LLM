|Some more devious Netherese Wizard discovered how to syphon the life energies of his enemies and convert it into magical energies. Some called him mad. Some called him brilliant. The rest called him careless for allowing this ability to only function by touch.

==Description==
The orb was carved from crystal that had a deep purple color.

==Powers==
The orb's primary use was in stealing life force from an injured victim and giving it to the wielder as magical energy. Thus, a caster could remain refreshed as long as they could keep physically striking a target. Less obviously, it granted a measure of protection against all sorts of hostile effects, especially elemental threats, and made the wielder's spells a little more deadly.

==History==
The orb was used by Netherese forces led by the [[arcanist]] [[Shai]] when she and Archwizard [[Amskar]] captured the meddling [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] at [[Yarrow Glade]] in the [[Storm Horns]]. The ambush was broken by Oriphaun's allies, who defeated Shai and her group, and captured the orb in the process.
