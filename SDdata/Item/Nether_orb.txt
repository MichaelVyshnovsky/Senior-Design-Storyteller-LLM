The nether orb was a magical crystal orb used by the forces of the Empire of Shade in the mid-1480s DR.
The orb was carved from crystal that had a deep purple color.
The orbs primary use was in stealing life force from an injured victim and giving it to the wielder as magical energy. Thus, a caster could remain refreshed as long as they could keep physically striking a target. Less obviously, it granted a measure of protection against all sorts of hostile effects, especially elemental threats, and made the wielders spells a little more deadly.
The orb was used by Netherese forces led by the arcanist Shai when she and Archwizard Amskar captured the meddling Oriphaun Huntsilver at Yarrow Glade in the Storm Horns. The ambush was broken by Oriphauns allies, who defeated Shai and her group, and captured the orb in the process.
