Creatures that listened to the harps music for at least 12 seconds also received the effects of the cure light wounds (this power can only affect a creature once per tenday). As the harp was played, the harpist radiated magical light.\nDoves harps could be created by an individual proficient in crafting wondrous items, and had access to calm emotions, greater restoration, healing circle, and light spells."
