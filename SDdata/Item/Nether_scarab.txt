A '''''nether scarab''''' was a deadly ancient talisman capably of storing, and later releasing, energy from attacks.

==Powers==
This item protected the wearer from attacks involving magical and [[undead]] energy draining, absorbing that energy into the talisman to be stored. The wearer could release any energy stored in this manner by touching a victim, immediately draining a portion of their life essence and transferring it directly to the wearer of the ''nether scarab''.

==Notable Owners==
[[Kazerabet]], a dangerous [[necromancer]] from the isle of [[Sahu]], carried a ''nether scarab''.

==History==
The precise method for the creation of these items was lost. Kazerabet's ''[[Art of Necromancy]]'' stated that ''nether scarabs'' usually had ten charges, but rare versions existed that held twice as many charges. These items could never be recharged.
