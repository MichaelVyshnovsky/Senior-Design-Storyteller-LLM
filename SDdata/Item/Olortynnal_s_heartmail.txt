Olortynnals Heartmail was a suit of dwarf-created enchanted armor famously worn by the Arms-Major of the AkhVelahr, Kelvhan Olortynnal, during the Weeping War.
The Heartmail was a light and comfortable half-plate scale armor.
This set of magical armor possessed a +4 enchantment and was created to withstand even the most powerful attacks from the dragonkin, providing even higher defense against them.
Like other types of scale armor, the Heartmail, if worn by an arcane spellcaster, gave them a decent chance of spell-casting failure.
Olortynnals Heartmail was created by the dwarves of the House of Gems for the Arms-Major Kelvhan Olortynnal. He wore the armor during the Weeping War and was killed wearing it in the .
After the fall of Myth Drannor, the ghost of Harldain Ironbar was haunting the ruins and resided within Onaglym. From there he scoured through the destroyed city collecting ancient magical items and masterwork armor and weapons created by the dwarf crafters of the city for safekeeping within the ancient dwarven keep. By 1369 DR Olortynnals Heartmail was in Harldains possession.
