The lute of the merryweather bard was an enchanted musical instrument from the late 15 century DR.
This decorated lute hummed with magic, barely containing the voices of sprites and spirits.
The lute of the merryweather bard could be found in the Western Heartlands, along the banks of the River Chionthar in the late 15 century DR.
