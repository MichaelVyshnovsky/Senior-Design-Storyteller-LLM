A '''''bag of holding''''' was a [[magical item]], often a small sack, that acted as an opening to an extradimensional space. The space inside the bag could hold a huge amount of materials without increasing the weight of the bag.

==Description==
The ''bag of holding'' seemed like an ordinary bag on the outside, but it could hold more than it appeared to be able to, so it was used to ease transportation of items.

===Variants===
There were similar magical bags to the bag of holding:
* ''[[Bag of transmuting]]''
* ''[[Bag of devouring]]''

==Powers==
A typical ''bag of holding'' could hold up to {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}} of material that did not exceed a volume of {{SI|64|cubic feet|long=yes}}, although other types with different capacities existed. The bag also allowed a few of minutes of breathing air for creatures that could enter it. It could sustain temporarily a breathing creature for up to 10 minutes.

If a ''bag of holding'' was placed in extradimensional space like a ''[[portable hole]]'', then both would be lost forever, but a rift to the [[Astral Plane]] was opened. Versions of the ''bag of holding'' found after the [[Second Sundering]] did not destroy its contents if torn or destroyed. Instead, they were scattered in the [[Astral Plane]].

==History==
''Bags of holding'' were ancient magical items that had been known throughout the Realms from antiquity after the first of these items were brought over by [[kender]]s from the world of [[Krynn]].

==Reputation==
[[Lightfoot halfling]] communities were intrigued with all things related to ease of travel, so ''bags of holding'' were more common there than in other communities, as well as a bit cheaper to buy than in most places.
