The Diadem of Wise Rule was an enchanted crown worn by Siamorphe, the Divine Right.
A small golden sun hovered near the Diadem at all times.
The Diadem of Wise Rule functioned like a helm of brilliance, but all of the magical abilities issued forth from the hovering sun. The powers of the Diadem could not be exhausted.
