        "mainbody": "A fire poker, or fire iron (commonly known simply as a poker or iron), was a common household tool used to tend to fires.\nPokers were usually made of wrought iron shaped into a long bar or rod, with a hook or prong at the end. They were used to safely push and pull pieces of burning wood or other fuel inside a fireplace or campfire.\nPokers and similar fire-related tools and implements could be found at Ember Me More, a dedicated shop in Ravens Bluff."
