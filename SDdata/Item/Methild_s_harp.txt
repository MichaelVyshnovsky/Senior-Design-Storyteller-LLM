'''''Methild's harp''''' was a magical [[harp]] used by the [[Harpers]].

==Powers==
''Methild's harp'' had the ability to part all webs, open all locks, break all bonds, and untie all knots within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius of wherever it was played. ''[[Rope of constriction|Ropes of constriction]]'', ''[[rope of entanglement|ropes of entanglement]]'' and ''[[rug of smothering|rugs of smothering]]'' ceased functioning, releasing any trapped creatures. If a creature was currently trapped by said items, they were unable to play the harp to gain their freedom.

However, magical barriers such as protective symbols, ''[[force cage]]s'', ''[[shield (spell)|shields]]'', ''[[wall of force|walls of force]]'' that do not have an opening cannot be affected by the harp. Additionally, there was a chance that magical knots and locks could become immune to the effects of ''Methild's harp'' forever. Objects that were successfully affected by the harp's power were outlined by a glowing orange faerie fire from the moment they were affected.

==History==
''Methild's harp'' originated from the ancient city of [[Myth Drannor]]. However, a legend talked about the bard named [[Methild]] who lived in a tiny valley kingdom of [[Chilldion]] far from civilization. One winter night, a coven of three [[hag]]s took over the valley after ensorcelling the royal family. The hags were planning on eating the family whilst they were immobilized by the foul ''[[Hold person|holding]]'' magics. After a long day of conquest, spellcasting, and slaughtering of the innocent, the coven grew tired and ordered Methild, the court bard, to strum them a song. The bard was loyal to his king and brought along his [[enchanted]] harp. He played the instrument and focused its magics on the king first, dissolving the ''holding'' spell and allowing the king to sneak away. Methild continued to play and remove magic from everyone restrained by the hags, one by one. When every victim was freed, Methild could play no longer, and the coven realized the treachery. The bard did not escape and became the hags' supper instead of the king's family.
