Armor of the clerics of Myrkul were sets of enchanted Myrkulyte plate mail worked by the members of the Lord of the Deads clergy.
These sets of magic armor were enchanted to offer improved protection from several necromantic spells such as paralyze and death magic. Additionally, the armor increased the wearers fortitude. The armor proved that Myrkulyte priests only dealt in the business of death, showing no desire to join the ranks of the deceased.
Before Myrkuls death during the Time of Troubles, his clerics were adorned in these severe-looking armors as they performed duties of the faith, aiding the dead and dying, organizing funerals, and ruling in the cases of deceaseds unfinished affairs and enacting their wills. One of these magic armors fell into the hands of drow merchant of exotic goods â€“ Nym sometime circa the , as he camped in Icewind Dales Wandering Village.
