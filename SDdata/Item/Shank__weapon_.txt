'''Shanks''' were archaic weapons akin to a simple [[knife]] that were sometimes wielded by [[thieves]] and ne'er-do-wells.

==History==
Long before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], thieves of [[Waterdeep]] were known to wield these primitive weapons. One of the alleys that were a gathering place for such criminals would later be known as the [[Shank Alley]].

By the 14{{th}} century DR, {{SI|2'|'"|long=yes}} shanks had become a part of a standard set of [[thieves' picks]].
