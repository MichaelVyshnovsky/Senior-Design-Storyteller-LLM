Shanks were archaic weapons akin to a simple knife that were sometimes wielded by thieves and neer-do-wells.
Long before the late 14 century DR, thieves of Waterdeep were known to wield these primitive weapons. One of the alleys that were a gathering place for such criminals would later be known as the Shank Alley.
By the 14 century DR,  shanks had become a part of a standard set of thieves picks.
