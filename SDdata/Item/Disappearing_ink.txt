Disappearing ink was used, often by more sophisticated thieves, when one wanted their written word to be less than binding.
This ink was typically blue or red in color. Auroras Emporium offered several kinds of disappearing ink including ink that only lasted a few hours to a few days or even weeks or a month. Auroras also offered an ink that was invisible unless heated over a candle.
A bottle of disappearing ink cost 5 gold pieces through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. This item was available in either red or black.
