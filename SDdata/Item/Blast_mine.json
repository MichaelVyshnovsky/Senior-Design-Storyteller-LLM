        "mainbody": "A '''''blast mine''''' was a large [[explosive]] device that could be buried within the earth, and would detonate when anyone walked nearby.",
        "Description": "These explosives were immensely heavy, each one weighing {{SI|0.55|ton|k}}s. They were buried underground, with only a thin later of earth or other material resting upon its top.\n\nIt was possible to disarm a blast mine using a [[trap disarming toolkit]], or trigger them using certain weapons or manipulating [[force energy]].",
        "Function": "A blast mine was triggered by putting weight upon its uppermost section, the device's trigger. Once sufficient weight was placed upon the mine, it would burst in a great explosion of fire and force energy.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of the Absolute]] used blast mines to trap caves and caverns near to the [[Shattered Sanctum]]."
