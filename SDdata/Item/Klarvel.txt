Klarvels, or as they were more commonly referred to as, ring-loaves, were a type of lightly sweetened or savory bread that was baked in donut-shaped molds.
Klarvels were ring-shaped loaves of bread made of dark rye. When these were transported, klarvels quickly hardened and dried, becoming rock-hard gray crusts. Hardened klarvels were softened in broth, wine, or water before consumption. Sweet varieties were soaked overnight is sugared alcoholic drinks like mead, wine, or just honey.
Ring-loaves varied in size, depending on the region and the baker. The most traditional breads were between  and  across, and  thick. Breads that were baked for large groups or to be served at events were much larger. However, much smaller-sized klarvel handfoods were baked by hin and gnomes.
* Ring-loaves originated from the Land of the Lions, namely the nations of Lapaliiya, Estagund, and Murghôm. As of the late 14 and 15 century DR, ring-loaves popularity was spreading, carried by merchants and caravaners along trade-routes.
* The breads name, "klarvel", was used in Lapaliiya, while other regions used the more generic name – "ring-loaf."
* Estagunds bakers preferred a sweeter versions o these breads. Their klarvels were baked with molasses and walnuts.
* In the Vilhon Reach, ring-loaves were popular among nobility. The breads were soaked in sweet hard liquors, then presented to the guests on a fanciful platter with its center hole filled cream, berries, and sliced mangoes.
