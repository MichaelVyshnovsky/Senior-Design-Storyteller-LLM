Rings of restoration were enchanted ring that possessed curative powers.
These bands were quite heavy and cast in gold.
Aptly named, these rings allowed the wearer to cast the restoration spell at will. They possessed three charges.
In 1369 DR, on of the rings of restoration was on the finger of a Cult of the Dragons wizard during their occupation of Myth Drannor.
