The '''tuba''' was a type of bulky, [[brass]] wind instrument found in the Realms.

==Description==
The mouthpiece of a tuba was a tiny, tapered cylinder. The instrument itself produced a distinctive deep sound.

==History==
The instrument was known to members of [[Clan Melairkyn]], who kept a copy within the musical hall of their [[Dumathoin]] temple complex that later became known as the [[Lost Level]] of [[Undermountain]].

==Trivia==
A mournful note from a tuba could be heard whenever a ''[[wand of conducting]]'' spontaneously crumbled into dust.
