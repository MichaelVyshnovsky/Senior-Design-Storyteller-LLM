The tuba was a type of bulky, brass wind instrument found in the Realms.
The mouthpiece of a tuba was a tiny, tapered cylinder. The instrument itself produced a distinctive deep sound.
The instrument was known to members of Clan Melairkyn, who kept a copy within the musical hall of their Dumathoin temple complex that later became known as the Lost Level of Undermountain.
A mournful note from a tuba could be heard whenever a wand of conducting spontaneously crumbled into dust.
