        "mainbody": "ocus was a potion that significantly improved the ability to concentrate.\nFocus was a natural substance made by steeping duskwood bark and a secret mixture of herbs in water. The recipe belonged to the sorceress and alchemist Angrath Dree and was one of her most popular elixirs. It could be purchased from her at Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a single dose was 30 gp.\nThe effects of focus lasted ten minutes. During that time, the imbiber was more likely to succeed at tasks that required intense concentration."
