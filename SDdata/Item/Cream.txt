'''Cream''', sometimes referred to as '''whipping cream''', was a fatty [[milk]] product found throughout the [[Realms]] and used in savory cooking as well as pastry making.

==Description==
Cream was a viscous white dairy product kept in [[jug]]s and whipped for use in cooking, giving bakeries and kitchens a pleasant aroma that often went hand-in-hand with the smell of blooming [[yeast]].

==Usages==
[[Waterdhavian]] meals sometimes included bowls of clotted cream and [[strawberries]].

In the city of [[Neverwinter]], whipped cream was used to offset [[kaeth]]'s bitter taste. It was also used as a thickener in a puréed [[potato]] soup called [[cawl cennin]].

People of [[Baldur's Gate]] used whipping cream as an ingredient in making [[fiddlehead soup]].

[[Mushroom]]s in cream was a specialty of [[Swordsfall House]] in [[Silverymoon]].{{Cite web/My Slice of Silverymoon/Part 2}}

Cream from the [[Moonshae Isles]] was a staple of a hearty morningfeast: [[egg]]s, [[bacon]], and fresh cream. Similarly, a morningfeast in [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]], included sliced fruit in cream. Lavish morningfeasts in the city of [[Arrabar]] in [[Chondath]] included fresh cream, chilled and whipped to be smothered over [[bread]].

Some desserts made with cream included a bowl made out of chilled [[chocolate]], filled with sweet cherries and cream—a delicacy from [[Shadowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], cream was available in [[Finder Wyvernspur]]'s realm of [[Fermata]] in [[Arborea]].
