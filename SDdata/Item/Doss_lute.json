        "Description": "A Doss lute was usually carved from [[alder]] wood and of a graceful, pear-shaped form. Abstract designs were inlaid in the wood in [[copper]].",
        "Powers": "A skilled [[bard]] was able to use the magic of the lute to [[delay poison|delay]] (or even [[neutralize poison|neutralize]]) poison and cast the spells ''[[hold person]]'' and ''[[mirror image]]'' (or ''[[ghostly visage]]''), each once per day.\n\nIn addition, the lute could aid the bard's skills in captivating an audience, making ''[[suggestion]]s'', and in using song to counter sound-based spells.",
        "History": "It was said that a legendary bard in the [[Moonshaes]] named [[Falataer]] created the first Doss lute. He used the lute to both test and reward students of his bardic college. Subsequent bards copied the design but continued to keep the same name.\n\nIn [[1356 DR]], the merchant [[Sali Dalib]] in [[Calimport]] claimed to have a Doss lute for sale \"cheap.\"\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]] several powerful magical items, including a ''doss lute'', were brought to [[Toril]] by a planeswalking [[wizard]] [[Vejoni H. Wyzz]] who perched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of [[Liam's Hold]].",
