Abstract designs were inlaid in the wood in copper.\nA skilled bard was able to use the magic of the lute to delay (or even neutralize) poison and cast the spells hold person and mirror image (or ghostly visage), each once per day.\nIn addition, the lute could aid the bards skills in captivating an audience, making suggestions, and in using song to counter sound-based spells.\nIt was said that a legendary bard in the Moonshaes named Falataer created the first Doss lute. He used the lute to both test and reward students of his bardic college. Subsequent bards copied the design but continued to keep the same name.\nIn 1356 DR, the merchant Sali Dalib in Calimport claimed to have a Doss lute for sale \"cheap.\"\nCirca 1372 DR several powerful magical items, including a doss lute, were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who perched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liams Hold.\n*Birdsong A tabaxi bard from Chult in the late-15 century DR."
