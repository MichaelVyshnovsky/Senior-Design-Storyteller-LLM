'''''Domineering''''' was a magical [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be applied to [[weapon]]s. The wielder's opponent would be forced to fight defensively against a weapon with this quality if they could not resist; they wouldn't attack as well, but were better in defense.

==Creation==
In order to forge a ''domineering'' weapon, the caster had to have the ''[[fear]]'' spell available.
