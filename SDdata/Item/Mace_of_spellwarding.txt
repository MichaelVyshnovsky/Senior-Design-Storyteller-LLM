A '''''mace of spellwarding''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] ''+1 [[mace]]'' that absorbed [[magic]]al energy and stored it for a short time. While it was quite effective at protecting its wielder from [[arcane]] spells and effects, if too much energy was absorbed in this manner the mace reacted in a potentially dangerous and unpredictable manner.

==Description==
This type of mace was fine wrought from a single piece of oiled [[steel]]. Any time it struck an item, object or solid surface that bore a ''dweomer'', the mace shone with a magenta glow that increased with intensity the stronger the enchantment.

==Effects==
The force of any [[spell]]s, spell-like abilities or powers emanating from a magical items, which were directed at bearer of a ''mace of spellwarding'', were nullified and absorbed within the mace. The energy of these magical powers were stored within the mace and improved its ''enchantment'' for a matter of seconds.

Depending on the specifications of how each mace was crafted, only a certain amount of spell power could be absorbed in this manner before the weapon overloaded. If this point was reached, the mace released a brilliant burst of magenta-and-white light. Th ''mace of spellwarding'' and its bearer were then ''[[teleport]]ed'' to a relatively safe, but completely random location somewhere within the same [[plane of existence]].
