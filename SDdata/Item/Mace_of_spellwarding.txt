A mace of spellwarding was an enchanted +1 mace that absorbed magical energy and stored it for a short time. While it was quite effective at protecting its wielder from arcane spells and effects, if too much energy was absorbed in this manner the mace reacted in a potentially dangerous and unpredictable manner.
This type of mace was fine wrought from a single piece of oiled steel. Any time it struck an item, object or solid surface that bore a dweomer, the mace shone with a magenta glow that increased with intensity the stronger the enchantment.
The force of any spells, spell-like abilities or powers emanating from a magical items, which were directed at bearer of a mace of spellwarding, were nullified and absorbed within the mace. The energy of these magical powers were stored within the mace and improved its enchantment for a matter of seconds.
Depending on the specifications of how each mace was crafted, only a certain amount of spell power could be absorbed in this manner before the weapon overloaded. If this point was reached, the mace released a brilliant burst of magenta-and-white light. Th mace of spellwarding and its bearer were then teleported to a relatively safe, but completely random location somewhere within the same plane of existence.
