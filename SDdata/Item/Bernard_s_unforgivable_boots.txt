Bernards unforgivable boots were unassuming-looking enchanted boots.
Bernards unforgivable boots were a pair of old foul-smelling leather boots.
The unforgivable boots possessed an enchantment that made them exude fetid stench that decreased the charisma of the brave individual who decided to wear them. These old boots gave the wearer the ability to cast the stinking cloud spell.
In 1369 DR, this pair of unfortunate enchanted boots could be found in one of the trapped chests in the drow House Freths territory deep within the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor.
