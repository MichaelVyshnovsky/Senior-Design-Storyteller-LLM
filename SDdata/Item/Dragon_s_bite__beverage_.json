        "mainbody": "ragons bite was a mixed alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14 century DR, such as the Hidden Lady.\nA typical dragons bite was made using pale translucent green mint wine, pepper brandy, cinnamon powder, and licorice root.\nThe resulting mixed drink was minty-cool, with a licorice aftertaste. Dragons bite was not sweet nor bitter. It ended with the \"bite\", hot spicy cinnamon burn at the back of the drinkers throat."
