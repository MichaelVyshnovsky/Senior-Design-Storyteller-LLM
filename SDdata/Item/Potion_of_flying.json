        "mainbody": "A potion of flying was a very rare potion that gave its imbiber the ability to fly.\nThe liquid in potions of flying was transparent and floated at the top of the container. These potions also had cloudy white impurities drifting in the contained liquid.\nWhen these potions were consumed, the imbibers could fly as fast as they could usually walk, for an hour. If the users were in the air when the effect of the potion expired, they would fall to the ground, potentially taking damage.\nThe whiskers of sakinas could be used to make such potions. Another recipe for potion of flying called for a sublimate of eagle feathers.\n* Practical Potions, a potion shop in the city of Ravens Bluff, kept potions of flying in stock.\n* Anwar al-Sifr\n* Marianon Silmara"
