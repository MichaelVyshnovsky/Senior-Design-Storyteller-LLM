        "mainbody": "A '''''bowl of watery death''''' was a cursed [[magical item]] that drowned [[wizard]]s who used it.",
        "Description": "Indistinguishable from a ''[[bowl of commanding water elementals]]'', the ''bowl of watery death'' was a bowl {{SI|1|foot|c|long=yes}} across, half that much deep, made of semi-precious stones such as [[malachite]], [[lapis lazuli]], or sometimes [[jade]].",
        "Powers": "When a wizard filled the bowl with water, it responded by shrinking them to the size of an [[ant]] and plunging them into its depths, where it would immediately begin to drown them. The target was magically prevented from leaving the bowl or stopping their drowning; only a few magics, such as ''[[enlarge]]'', ''[[animal growth]]'' or ''[[wish]]'' could rescue the victim. Dropping a ''[[potion of growth]]'' into the bowl also saved the target, while a ''[[potion of sweet water]]'' allowed the victim another opportunity to thwart the power of the bowl. Victims drowned by the bowl were irrevocably gone, even to ''wish'' spells.\n\nIf used in the [[Nine Hells]], the subject was raised as a [[lemure]] within 10 hours.{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|43}}\n\nSaltwater only made the magic more aggressive.{{Cite dragon/251/Magic of the Seldarine|32}}-->",
        "History": "One such bowl was the only enchanted item among the wares in an abandoned shop selling grotesque-looking bowls in the [[Imaskari]] ruins underneath [[Solon]] in the {{yearlinkName|1367}}.{{cite book/Blood Charge|62}} Similar magic was used in one of the trials of [[Red Mountain Monastery]].{{cite book/Blood Charge|36}}\n\nThese devices were known in [[Zakhara]]."
