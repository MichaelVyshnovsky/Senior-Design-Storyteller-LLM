        "mainbody": "bowl of watery death was a cursed magical item that drowned wizards who used it.\nIndistinguishable from a bowl of commanding water elementals, the bowl of watery death was a bowl  across, half that much deep, made of semi-precious stones such as malachite, lapis lazuli, or sometimes jade.\nWhen a wizard filled the bowl with water, it responded by shrinking them to the size of an ant and plunging them into its depths, where it would immediately begin to drown them. The target was magically prevented from leaving the bowl or stopping their drowning only a few magics, such as enlarge, animal growth or wish could rescue the victim. Dropping a potion of growth into the bowl also saved the target, while a potion of sweet water allowed the victim another opportunity to thwart the power of the bowl. Victims drowned by the bowl were irrevocably gone, even to wish spells.\nIf used in the Nine Hells, the subject was raised as a lemure within 10 hours.\nSaltwater only made the magic more aggressive.-->\nOne such bowl was the only enchanted item among the wares in an abandoned shop selling grotesque-looking bowls in the Imaskari ruins underneath Solon in the . Similar magic was used in one of the trials of Red Mountain Monastery.\nThese devices were known in Zakhara."
