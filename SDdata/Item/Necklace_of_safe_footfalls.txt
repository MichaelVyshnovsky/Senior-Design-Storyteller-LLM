Necklaces of safe footfalls were enchanted pieces of dwarven jewelry from the ancient Myth Drannor.
Necklaces of safe footfalls were masterfully crafted thick ornate beaded torc chains that were placed around the wearers neck, similarly to jewelry found in Mulhorand.
Necklaces of safe footfalls had two enchantments. The first one was a +2 enchantment to the wearers defense and protection against spells and magical effects. The second granted the wearer full protection against magical traprunes, often used by dwarven wizards along with regular traps.
In 1369 DR, one of the necklaces of safe footfalls was recovered by the Veiled Ones from an ancient dwarven tomb underneath Glim-Gardens, along with another magical curio, the Stone Mouth.
