'''''Necklaces of safe footfalls''''' were enchanted pieces of [[dwarf|dwarven]] jewelry from the ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Necklaces of safe footfalls'' were masterfully crafted thick ornate beaded torc chains that were placed around the wearer's neck, similarly to jewelry found in [[Mulhorand]].

==Powers==
''Necklaces of safe footfalls'' had two enchantments. The first one was a ''+2'' enchantment to the wearer's defense and protection against spells and magical effects. The second granted the wearer full protection against magical ''traprunes'', often used by dwarven wizards along with regular traps.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], one of the ''necklaces of safe footfalls'' was recovered by the [[Veiled Ones]] from an ancient dwarven tomb underneath [[Glim-Gardens]], along with another magical curio, the ''[[Stone Mouth]]''.
