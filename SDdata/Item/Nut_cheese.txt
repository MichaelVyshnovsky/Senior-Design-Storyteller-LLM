Nut cheese was a type of cheese mixed with nuts produced in many cities of the Savage Frontier, including Silverymoon, Mirabar, and Sundabar. A selection was available from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Each Northern city produced its own variety of nut cheese. If ordered from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue without specifying a desired origin, a customer would receive an assorted lot.
Nut cheeses were hard and rich, and mixed with ground hickory nuts, walnuts, and chestnuts. Once mixed with the nuts, the cheeses would be left to ripen.
