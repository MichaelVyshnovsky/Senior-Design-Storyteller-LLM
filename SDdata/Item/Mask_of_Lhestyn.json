        "Description": "The ''mask of Lhestyn'' was an elegant veil made of white [[silk]]. It was bejeweled and a string of black [[pearl]]s secured the veil across the brow.",
        "Powers": "This magical item bestowed upon its wearer the same magical effects as both a ''[[hat of disguise]]'' and a ''[[medallion of thoughts]]''.",
        "History": "It was created by [[Shilarn Silmaeril]] as a gift to her daughter [[Lhestyn]]. Lhestyn used the mask to infiltrate the [[Shadow Thieves]] with the goal of investigating the guild's activities. After successfully exposing the guild, the mask then became a symbol in Waterdeep. Waterdhavians look upon the mask as a symbol of justice. When [[Zelphar Arunsun]], Lhestyn's husband, died in {{Yearlink|1311}}, the mask vanished. Many suspected he was murdered by the Shadow Thieves; however, the guild continued to search for the missing mask.",
