        "History": "''Dorgan's Defender'' was created by the dwarven Clan Orcsmasher, notorious for their hatred of [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, and various evil [[humanoid]]s. The clan spent many centuries being a bane of evil creatures of the [[Cloud Peaks]]. Then, one gloomy day, long before [[1374 DR]], an alliance of goblins and orcs attacked the stronghold of Clan Orcsmasher. The horde poured from the mountains on the clan's home, plunging the settlement into a several-days-long war. By the end of the struggle, no dwarf was left alive apart from Dorgan Orcsmasher, his wife, and children. Dorgan ordered his kin to flee as he stood alone against the horde with ''Dorgan's Defender'' in hand. He slew many orcs and bought enough time for his family to reach safety.\n\nA year after the fall of the Clan Orcsmasher, Dorgan's family returned to the site of the bloody carnage. There, they witnessed their patriarch's corpse propped up against a mountain of dead orcs and goblins who were cut down by his last stand. ''Dorgan's Defender'' was left at the feet of its deceased master. Thus, Dorgan Orcsmasher became celebrated by the dwarf-kin as the exemplar of dwarven endurance and determination.\n\nBy [[1374 DR]], ''Dorgan's Defender'' found its way to the [[Moonsea]] region and into the hands of a dwarven mercenary killer for hire of [[Hillsfar]] â€“ [[Thorne]]. The dwarf was sent on behest of [[Maalthiir]], the leader of Hillsfar, to spy on the town of [[Voonlar]]. ''Dorgan's Defender'' accompanied its new master on the mission."
