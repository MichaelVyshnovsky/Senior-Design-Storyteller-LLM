'''Tiamat's scale''' was a [[magical item]] rumored to be made from a scale of [[Tiamat]] herself.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5,16-17}}

==Description==
As big as a large [[shield]]&mdash;almost {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} wide&mdash;this relic was the flawless scale of an ancient [[red dragon]] inscribed with numerous runes and adorned with precious metals. It looked like polished red metal, and a faint orange-red glow visible to the naked eye emanated from it at all times.

==Powers==
While this relic radiated powerful [[abjuration]] and [[illusion]] magics when inspected through magical means, its powers were unknown. According to [[Skovac]], the [[druid]] who watched over it in both life and undeath, its magical powers were strong enough to subvert the will of [[dragon]]s.

==History==
After the defeat of the [[Circle of the Scale]] at the hands of the dragon [[Scorlworyx]] and her armies, the scale was entombed in the [[Temple of the Scale]] with the leader of the [[druid circle]]. During the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] tracked the location of the scale and aimed to retrieve it in an attempt to rally Scorlworyx to their cause.
