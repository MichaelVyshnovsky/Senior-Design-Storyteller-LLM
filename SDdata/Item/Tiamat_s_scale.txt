Tiamats scale was a magical item rumored to be made from a scale of Tiamat herself.
As big as a large shield&mdashalmost  wide&mdashthis relic was the flawless scale of an ancient red dragon inscribed with numerous runes and adorned with precious metals. It looked like polished red metal, and a faint orange-red glow visible to the naked eye emanated from it at all times.
While this relic radiated powerful abjuration and illusion magics when inspected through magical means, its powers were unknown. According to Skovac, the druid who watched over it in both life and undeath, its magical powers were strong enough to subvert the will of dragons.
After the defeat of the Circle of the Scale at the hands of the dragon Scorlworyx and her armies, the scale was entombed in the Temple of the Scale with the leader of the druid circle. During the 15 century DR, the Cult of the Dragon tracked the location of the scale and aimed to retrieve it in an attempt to rally Scorlworyx to their cause.
