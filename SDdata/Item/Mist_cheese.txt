'''Mist cheese''', also called '''Loudwater mist''' and known as '''ethereal cheese''' to [[elves]], was a rich [[cheese]] crafted in [[Loudwater Vale]] within the [[Savage Frontier]].

==Description==
Mist cheese was a soft white cheese with a unique taste and succulent bite. It was translucent if sliced thinly enough, hence its names.

==Production==
Mist cheese was ripened in caves in the Loudwater Vale, which led to its distinct flavor and appearance.

==Prices==
It was sold through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Mist cheese could be purchased only as a load weighing 1 lb (0.45 kg) for 2 [[gp]].

==History==
In the [[1365 DR|Year of the Sword, 1365 DR]], [[Rivaldo|Sir Rivaldo]] was traveling in a coach along the [[Trade Way]] from the [[Way Inn]] to [[Waterdeep]] with an assortment of fine cheeses, including Loudwater mist.
