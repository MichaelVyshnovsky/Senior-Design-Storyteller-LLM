        "mainbody": "Scale Cleaver was an enchanted sword originating in Chult.\nA very well-forged long sword, it was adorned with intertwining symbols from the language of its elven creators, which told of its origin and purpose.If these elves are assumed to speak Elven, then these symbols are likely some form of Espruar.\nThis sword was crafted by a rare elven people living in marshes within the jungles of Chult in order to aid them in their age-old battles against the lizard men.\nNormally a +1 long sword, it became more powerful, rising to +5, against all foes covered in natural scalesâ€”not only lizardfolk, but also lizards, snakes, fish, and dragons, and even those wearing armor made of natural scales."
