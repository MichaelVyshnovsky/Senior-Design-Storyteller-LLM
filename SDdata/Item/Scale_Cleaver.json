        "Description": "A very well-forged [[long sword]], it was adorned with intertwining symbols from the language of its elven creators, which told of its origin and purpose.If these elves are assumed to speak [[Elven language|Elven]], then these symbols are likely some form of Espruar.",
        "History": "This sword was crafted by a rare [[elf|elven people]] living in marshes within the jungles of Chult in order to aid them in their age-old battles against the [[lizard men]].",
        "Powers": "Normally a ''+1 long sword'', it became more powerful, rising to ''+5'', against all foes covered in natural scalesâ€”not only lizardfolk, but also [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fish]], and [[dragon]]s, and even those wearing armor made of natural scales."
