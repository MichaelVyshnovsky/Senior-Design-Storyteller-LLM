        "Description": "''Gauntlets of ogre size'' were noticeably oversized gauntlets, of much bigger size than that of a [[human]] hand.",
        "Powers": "These enormous gloves increased the wearer's defenses but made them significantly easy to hit.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], a pair of ''gauntlets of ogre size'' was in the possession of a [[dark naga]] that could be found in its lair in the tomb under the [[House Ammath]] mansion in [[Glim-Gardens]] of [[Myth Drannor]], a part of [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. The gauntlets, along with the ''[[boots of the tortoise]]'' and [[Alaric's charm]] were locked in naga's chests."
