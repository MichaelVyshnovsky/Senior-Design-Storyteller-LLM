        "mainbody": "Gauntlets of ogre size were magic gauntlets of truly ogre proportions of both positive and negative enchantments.\nGauntlets of ogre size were noticeably oversized gauntlets, of much bigger size than that of a human hand.\nThese enormous gloves increased the wearers defenses but made them significantly easy to hit.\nIn 1369 DR, a pair of gauntlets of ogre size was in the possession of a dark naga that could be found in its lair in the tomb under the House Ammath mansion in Glim-Gardens of Myth Drannor, a part of Dwarven Dungeons. The gauntlets, along with the boots of the tortoise and Alarics charm were locked in nagas chests."
