Scarves of embellishments were legendary artifacts, designed to be worn with a sash of embellishments and one of the enchanted storytellers journals.
Scarves of embellishments were enchanted in a process that involved the fabric being submerged and soaked in the essence of a slain atropal. The resulting magic granted the wearer protection from unholy power and slightly boosted their mental and physical attributes. When the wearer used other items of the set, their mental and physical prowess was boosted even further and granted the wearer limited protection from all damage.
Scarves of embellishments were first in use in the late 15 century DR and found in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North.
