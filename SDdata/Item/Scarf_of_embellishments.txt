'''''Scarves of embellishments''''' were legendary [[artifact]]s, designed to be worn with a ''[[sash of embellishments]]'' and one of the [[enchanted]] ''storyteller's journals.''

==Powers==
''Scarves of embellishments'' were enchanted in a process that involved the fabric being submerged and soaked in the essence of a slain [[atropal]]. The resulting magic granted the wearer protection from unholy power and slightly boosted their mental and physical attributes. When the wearer used other items of the set, their mental and physical prowess was boosted even further and granted the wearer limited protection from all damage.

==History==
''Scarves of embellishments'' were first in use in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].
