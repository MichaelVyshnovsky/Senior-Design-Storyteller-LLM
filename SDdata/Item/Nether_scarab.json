        "mainbody": "A nether scarab was a deadly ancient talisman capably of storing, and later releasing, energy from attacks.\nThis item protected the wearer from attacks involving magical and undead energy draining, absorbing that energy into the talisman to be stored. The wearer could release any energy stored in this manner by touching a victim, immediately draining a portion of their life essence and transferring it directly to the wearer of the nether scarab.\nKazerabet, a dangerous necromancer from the isle of Sahu, carried a nether scarab.\nThe precise method for the creation of these items was lost. Kazerabets Art of Necromancy stated that nether scarabs usually had ten charges, but rare versions existed that held twice as many charges. These items could never be recharged."
