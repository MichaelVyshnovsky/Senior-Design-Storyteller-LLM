Guktoks Chopper was an oversized enchanted axe that belonged to dwarf-hating orc chieftain Guktok.
Guktoks Chopper was a one-handed and heavy axe, imbued with a +2 enchantment. When this orcish axe was wielded against dwarves. however, its enchantment effectively became +4, doubling its effectiveness.
This axe earned notoriety sometime during the 10 century DR, during the prosperous days of the dwarvish community of the Dorns Deep. Wielded by the dwarf-hating orc chieftain Guktok, the Chopper slew numerous stout folks of their outposts in the deep north of Faer√ªn. The orcs hatred was so severe, he relentlessly tortured all dwarves who were unlucky enough to be captured alive. Eventually, the dwarven forces of the Dorns Deep brought justice on Guktoks head. His clan was whipped out of the face of the north, and Guktoks head was mounted on a pike as a warning to any other dwarf mass murderers.
By 1281 DR, Guktoks Chopper found its way into the ruined halls of the Severed Hand, an elven citadel at the Spine of the World. The axe was wielded by one of the shadowed ghostly orcs who dwelled among many unholy creatures that infested the Hand of the Seldarine.
