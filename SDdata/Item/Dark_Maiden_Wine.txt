Dark Maiden Wine was a variety of wine created by the dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff named Bowser in the late 14 century DR.
In the , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking—Dark Maiden Wine—to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making as well.
