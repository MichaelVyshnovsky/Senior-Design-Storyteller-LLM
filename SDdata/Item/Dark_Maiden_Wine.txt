'''Dark Maiden Wine''' was a variety of [[wine]] created by the [[dwarf|dwarvish]] alesmith of [[Ravens Bluff]] named [[Bowser]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking—Dark Maiden Wine—to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about [[ale]], so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making as well.
