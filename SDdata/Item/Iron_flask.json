        "mainbody": "An '''''iron flask''''' was a powerful magic item that was capable of trapping and binding a creature that was not native to the [[plane]] on which it was located.",
        "Description": "An ''iron flask'' was shaped like an [[iron]] bottle with a [[brass]] stopper.",
        "Powers": "By speaking the command word of the ''iron flask'', the user could trap a nearby extraplanar creature inside it for an indeterminate amount of time. It was possible for the creature to resist being trapped, and creatures that had been trapped before were harder to imprison again.\n\nUpon removing the brass stopper, the imprisoned creature was released and bound to obey the owner of the flask for one hour, after which it would be free to act as it pleased.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Amelior Amanitas]] owned a [[gold]] and [[copper]] variant of the ''iron flask'', which held a [[djinn]] and two [[ogre]]s respectively. At one point he provided a group of [[adventurer]]s he had hired two [[brass]] variants of the ''iron flask''. These required a user to speak a [[command word]] to imprison a creature, which was, \"into the flask you go...\"\n* Duke [[Zalto]], a [[fire giant]] who used an ''iron flask'' to imprison [[Maegera]]."
