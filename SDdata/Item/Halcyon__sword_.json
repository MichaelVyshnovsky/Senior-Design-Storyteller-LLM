        "Description": "''Halcyon'' was a beautiful sword decorated with filigreed etchings.",
        "Powers": "''Halcyon'' was effectively a ''+5 [[holy avenger]]'' [[long sword]]. It proved to be effective against shapeshifting monsters like [[doppelgangers]], sizzling the monsters' blood and making the blade smoke as if sprayed with [[acid]].",
        "History": "In [[1371 DR]],{{DDTS}}, Piergeiron the Paladinson wore his favorite decorated sword during the wedding ceremony with [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]]. ''Halcyon'' snapped the peace-strings on its scabbard exactly four times during the luxurious event. It proved to be useful against doppelgangers menacing his wife-to-be and it sparked interest in her dimwitted relatives [[Becil Boareskyr]] and [[Bullard Boareskyr]]."
