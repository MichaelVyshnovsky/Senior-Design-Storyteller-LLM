        "mainbody": "ositoxins were special alchemical mixtures distilled with holy water and laced with positive energy. They effected corporeal undead the way poisons effected the living.\nPositoxins could break down an undeads physical body, potentially permanently. Such substances also disrupted the negative energy that animated the creatures. Positoxins were harmless to all other creatures (including incorporeal undead), and as supernatural substances, an antimagic field or similar area rendered them ineffective.\nSpells such as detect poison, delay poison, and neutralize poison effected positoxins as if they were poisons.\nExamples of positoxins included\n Bloodwine  A viscous, crimson positoxin that included garlic in its creation, making particularly harmful to vampires. Bloodwine remained in bloodstream of a living creature who ingested it for up to 12 hours, and would harm any undead that tried to drink blood from a bloodwine-laced creature.\n Boneshard paste  A pale-colored positoxen made with bone fragments.\n Celestial essence  A thick, golden substance that shown with inner radiance. It would disorient and disrupt undead creatures.\n Gravedust  A positoxin that resembled the grime found in tombs due to its gray color and dusty consistency.\n Lichbane  A positoxin the color bleached bone that was particularly dangerous against intelligent undead, since it damaged their mental abilities.\n Liquid mortality  A potent oil thought by many intelligent undead to be a legend, liquid mortality was capable of completely destroying an undead creature.\n Sunlight oil  A thin, slippery liquid that lost potency after 24 hours if kept in conditions other than bright light.\nIn 1375 DR, the half-fiend yuan-ti Kharantes, used a positoxin of his own creation, called hsskala or nearkill, to render a corporeal undead lich unconscious."
