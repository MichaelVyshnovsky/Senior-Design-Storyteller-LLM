'''''Gravemaster's blinder''''' was an enchanted [[helmet]] to be used by a [[lich]], designed sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The helmet was a mask that had no openings for the wearer's eyes, making it a blinding piece of equipment. However, it was creted to be used by powerful liches who did not need to relay on physical sight as senses were easily fooled. ''Gravemaster's blinder'' boosted the wearer's life essence, aim, defense, deflection of attacks, and increased their magical abilities to steal opponents' lives. Additionally, every time the wearer slew a creature, ''Gravemaster's blinder'' had a chance of summoning a [[wraith]] under the wearer's control.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] dispatched agents to the [[Jungles of Chult]] as the dangerous [[death curse]] began spreading across [[Faer√ªn]]. ''Gravemaster's blinder'' was one of the rare pieces of enchanted gear brought to Chult by [[Szass Tam]]'s [[mage]]s and his [[undead]] servants.
