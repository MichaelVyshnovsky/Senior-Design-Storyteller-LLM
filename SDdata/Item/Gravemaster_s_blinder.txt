Gravemasters blinder was an enchanted helmet to be used by a lich, designed sometime before the late 15 century DR.
The helmet was a mask that had no openings for the wearers eyes, making it a blinding piece of equipment. However, it was creted to be used by powerful liches who did not need to relay on physical sight as senses were easily fooled. Gravemasters blinder boosted the wearers life essence, aim, defense, deflection of attacks, and increased their magical abilities to steal opponents lives. Additionally, every time the wearer slew a creature, Gravemasters blinder had a chance of summoning a wraith under the wearers control.
In the late 15 century DR, the Red Wizards of Thay dispatched agents to the Jungles of Chult as the dangerous death curse began spreading across Faer√ªn. Gravemasters blinder was one of the rare pieces of enchanted gear brought to Chult by Szass Tams mages and his undead servants.
