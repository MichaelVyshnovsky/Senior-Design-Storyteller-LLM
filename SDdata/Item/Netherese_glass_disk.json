        "mainbody": "A Netherese glass disk was the name given to a specific type of disk-shaped magical item that originated from the ancient empire of Netheril that allowed an individual to travel without being noticed.\nThe disk of dark glass was typically cool to the touch, though it could grow warmer under certain circumstances. When thrown it would light up with a vivid radiance, float in the air, and slowly descend towards the ground. It was considered to be a very simple enchantment for the era in which it was made.\nWhile a glass disk created no effects when carried in a pack or other form of storage, when touched by an individual, it caused them to be imperceptible to anyone that was not expected to encounter them.\nOne of these disks was uncovered by a band of Red Wizards from Thay, and used for their hit-and-run ambushes for a number of years. They carried it during their assault against a caravan headed from the city of Scornubel to Hlondeth, in the , but lost it during the ensuing battle.\nThe disk was recovered by the mage Druhallen and carried with him during his journeys across the Realms. He sought answers about its origins at Candlekeep, before finally finding some peace and insight thanks to his time spent studying one of the fabled Nether Scrolls and a conversation with Lady Wyndyfarh of Weathercote Wood."
