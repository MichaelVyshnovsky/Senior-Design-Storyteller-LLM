Standard horses were the cheapest at 3 gp, pegasi and unicorns sold for 4 gp, sea lions for 5 gp, and dragon styled rocking mounts for 8 gp. Additionally, Toysmiths offered rocking mounts styled to resemble griffins at a cost of 4 gp.\n* The Cassalanter family owned and kept a rocking mount shaped like a warhorse within their villas playroom in the late 15 century DR.\n* The treasure hoard of Guh inside Grudd Haug included a rocking horse with silver inlays and blue quartzes for eyes.\n* The Martikov family, operators of the Wizard of Wines in Barovia, owned a rocking horse that was painted to resemble a nightmare.\n* The Shadowdusk family owned a rocking horse, that at one point had been partially scorched by fire, and kept it within their familys vault of treasures.\n* Skabatha Nightshade owned a rocking horse she flew upon.
