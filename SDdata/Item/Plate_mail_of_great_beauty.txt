The plate mail of great beauty was a cursed set of plate mail.
Though it shone with a beautiful golden sheen, the plate mail was cursed with a -3 enchantment, making the user much weaker when worn.
Circa 1358 DR, the armor set could be found far underneath Waterdeep, close to a gathering of drow outcasts.
