The '''''wand of Electra''''' was a powerful [[wand]], similar to a ''[[wand of lightning bolts]]''.

==Description==
The ''wand of Electra'' was an unassuming [[iron]] rod.

==Powers==
This rod allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spell at will. It possessed four charges.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the ''[[ring of Electra]]'' and its sister item, the ''wand of Electra'', could be found in the [[Cult of the Dragon]]-controlled upper levels of [[Eleven Catacombs]] underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Each of the enchanted items was placed in a chest on the opposite rooms of a small healing alcove. Each room was guarded by several [[skeleton]] lords who came to life and attacked anyone who was bold enough to steal elven treasures.
