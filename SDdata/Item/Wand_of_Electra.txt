The wand of Electra was a powerful wand, similar to a wand of lightning bolts.
The wand of Electra was an unassuming iron rod.
This rod allowed the wearer to cast the lightning bolt spell at will. It possessed four charges.
In 1369 DR, the ring of Electra and its sister item, the wand of Electra, could be found in the Cult of the Dragon-controlled upper levels of Eleven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. Each of the enchanted items was placed in a chest on the opposite rooms of a small healing alcove. Each room was guarded by several skeleton lords who came to life and attacked anyone who was bold enough to steal elven treasures.
