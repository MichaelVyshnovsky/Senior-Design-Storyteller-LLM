        "mainbody": "A lajatang was a martial arts weapon common in the empire of Shou Lung.\nThe lajatang was a double-headed weapon, having a  long staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. Some of them had smaller barbs coming from the outer edges of the blades.\ncenter|280px|A lajatang with barbs.\nThis unsual weapon required the skill of a martial artist to use effectively. It was carried in two hands.\nIn Kara-Tur, these weapons commonly sold for 7 tael, but they could be as expensive as 90 gold pieces elsewhere.\nThe lajatang was invented in Shou Lung.\nthumb|right|280px|A wang-liang weilding a lajatang attacks.\nJirozu no Nakamaru, the oyabun of the Big Head yakuza group, owned a lajatang.
