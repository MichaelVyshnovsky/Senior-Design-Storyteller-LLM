        "mainbody": "feather of diatryma summoning was a magic feather that temporarily transformed into a diatryma at the service of its summoner.\nFeathers of diatryma summoning were brightly colored plumes that were produced from feathers of diatrymas.\nUpon pronouncing the feathers command word and throwing it into an empty space, it transformed into a diatryma for up to 6 hours, following its summoners commands and helping its summoners allies. The summoned bird could also be used as a mount. The bird could be dismissed early if killed or if the summoner pronounced the command word again, while touching it. It then reverted to feather form.\nAfter being used, the power of a feather of diatryma summoning could be used again after 7 days.\nThe mercenary Jarlaxle Baenre owned a feather of diatryma summoning. He wore it as an ornament to his hat."
