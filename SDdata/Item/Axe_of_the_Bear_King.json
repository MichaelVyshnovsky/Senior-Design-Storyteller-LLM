        "mainbody": "The '''''Axe of the Bear King''''' was a unique [[greataxe]] of [[Rashemi]] make, created sometime long before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The [[iron]] weapon was crudely crafted but surrounded by an aura of powerful magic. Its ceremonial purpose was obvious from the fact that no [[bear]] [[telthor]] could actually wield an axe.",
        "Powers": "This greataxe was enhanced with a powerful ''+4 enchantment'' that dealt additional damage and guided the wielder's arm towards the foe. Despite its crude appearance, it was ensorcelled with the ''[[keen]]'' enchantment that kept the axe's blade sharp and deadly. Additionally, the ''axe of the Bear King'' discharged a burst of magical electricity with every successful attack.",
        "History": "The ''axe of the Bear King'' was a gift from the [[Witches of Rashemen]] to [[Okku]], the great bear spirit. The weapon was stored within a burial burrow in Rashemen, north of the city of [[Mulsantir]], where the great spirit Okku rested until the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
