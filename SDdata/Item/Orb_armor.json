        "mainbody": "Orb armor, also known as beholder armor, was the general term for armor used by beholders. Although most beholders found the idea of admitting physical vulnerability or covering their forms abhorrent, some did use orb armor to supplement their survivability.\nOrb armor was essentially mundane armor, but designed for beholders. It consisted of a heap of loose armor plates and patches held together with straps, and was much more flexible and articulated than a solid shell of protection. The beholder used their telekinesis eyeray to lift it up and assemble it on their body. It weighed about four times as much and cost about twice as much to make as regular humanoid armor."
