        "mainbody": "A lathe was a mechanical device used by artisans to work various materials.\nWood, metal, and stone could be turned on a lathe using specialized blade bits to cut the material, creating regularly shaped staves, spindles, columns, rods, candlesticks, and other rounded components used for weapons, tools, furniture, and other items. Maillers used a lathe that didnt carve the material, but instead coiled wire into loops that were then cut and riveted, ultimately being made into chain mail.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a 20 gp lathe that could hold a  by  piece of stone or wood to be worked. They also offered woodcutting bits (5 gp) and stonecutting bits (15 gp) alongside it."
