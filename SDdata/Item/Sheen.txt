'''Sheen''' was a variety of [[obsidian]] with many tiny sparkles. If the spangles were gold in color it was known as [[gold sheen]] and was classified as a [[semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] with a higher base value.

==Description==
Sheen came in many colors ranging from mahogany to russet to silver to gold. If large and without flaws it was usually tumbled and polished. Otherwise the flaws were cut away to make cabochons. Sheen could be polished to a satiny gleaming finish.

==Powers==
Sheen could be added to the material component of any spell that created light or radiance and allowed the caster to control the color of the emissions very precisely. If added to ''[[invisibility]]'' spells, it increased their duration by up to three minutes.

==Trivia==
* The [[lesser deity]] [[Iyachtu Xvim]] was known to occasionally send sheens to show favor or inspire his followers.
