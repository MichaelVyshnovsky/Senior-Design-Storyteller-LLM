Prestidigitation involved a variety of objects in the Realms popular among bards and performers who used them to appear to perform magic tricks.
Items used for prestidigitation performances included marked playing cards, hollow-topped hats, pocket scarves, foldable canes, flowering rods, and retractable knives.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 3â€“4 gold pieces.
* Prestidigitation items were favored by bards.
