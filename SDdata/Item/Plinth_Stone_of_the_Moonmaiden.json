        "mainbody": "The Plinth Stone of the Moonmaiden was one of the earliest altars used by the faithful of Sel√ªne on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep.\nThe Plinth Stone was a massive block of tarnished silver. On its surface was carved a symbol of the Moonmaiden.\nThe Plinth Stone was stolen by the church of Shar, and hidden in their base of Vanrakdoom. Defaced by carving a Holy symbol of Shar on top of that of the moon goddess, it served as a bier for Gorothirs sarcophagus.\n* Lord Vanrak Moonstar the Dark Ranger, death knight of Shar."
