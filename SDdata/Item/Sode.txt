'''Sode''' was a type of [[armor]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The sode was a protective armor that shielded the wearer's shoulder. Typically square or rectangular in shape, it measured approximately {{SI|1|sq ft|c|long=yes}}. The sode was securely attached to other armor pieces, particularly the corselet, using cords. As a result, it could not be worn independently and necessitated the presence of the [[do-maru]], [[hara-ate]], [[haramaki]], or [[haramaki-do]].

During battles, it was not uncommon to tie a piece of cloth known as the sode jiruchi over the sode. This cloth was often [[dye]]d or painted with a distinctive emblem or badge that identified the wearer.
