'''''Rings of folly''''' were cursed magic items that originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
''Rings of folly'' could be found with a wide array of decorations and made from different metals.

==Powers==
When worn, this cursed ring drained the wearer's natural intelligence and wisdom until they were bumbling idiots. This draining effect was subtle and only noticed when the wearer was required to perform some act requiring rational thought, such as to cast a spell or recite a poem.

A ''ring of folly'' could only be removed with a combination of ''[[remove curse]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]'' spells, at which point the wearer's senses would slowly return to them if given enough bed rest.

In some cases ''rings of folly'' granted beneficial magic such as ''[[feather fall|feather falling]]'' or ''[[invisibility]]'' in addition to their cursed effect.

==Notable Rings of Folly==
*''[[Discipliner]]'': several ''Discipliners'' were crated by [[Hergal Norin]] of [[Narfell]] to reward to his most self-absorbed and arrogant students.
