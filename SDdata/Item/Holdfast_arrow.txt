'''''Holdfast arrows''''' were types of [[enchanted]] ammunition most commonly used by [[Eldath]]-worshiping [[ranger]]s.

==Description==
These special [[arrow]]s often were decorated with blue and green ribbons and even flowers, to accentuate their peaceful nature.

==Powers==
''Holdfast arrows'' were less effective in battle due to their non-combat and humane purpose. Even though they had a ''+1'' enchantment, they dealt less damage than regular arrows and were often used to restrain rampaging [[beast]]s with minimal harm. Upon reaching their targets, ''holdfast arrows'' enveloped them in restraining vines, similar to those of the ''[[entangle]]'' spell.

==History==
Most commonly, these arrows were crafted by Eldathyn rangers from the [[Western Heartlands]]. In [[1281 DR]], these arrows could be found in [[Lonelywood]] and the wider [[Ten Towns]] area of [[Icewind Dale]].
