A belt of protection was a belt the protected the wearer from harm.
In 1358 DR, these belts could be found in item shops across the Sword Coast North, and several islands out to sea. In Fireshear, highly enchanted versions were available to be purchased.
These magical belts made the wearers more likely to resist attacks and made them better at avoiding damaging effects.
