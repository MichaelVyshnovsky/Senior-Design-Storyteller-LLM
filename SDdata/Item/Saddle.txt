A '''saddle''' was a seat attached to a creature, either for riding or carrying objects.
{{Quote
|Those who think saddles uncomfortable have never ridden a [[horse]] bareback.

==Description==
===Types===
{{Quote
|A man's greatest pleasure is the feel of hooves pounding beneath his saddle, to watch the [[deer]] fleeing before his [[horse]], and to see his [[arrow]]s down his prey.
|[[Hubadai]]
}}

Saddles were mainly split into two groups: riding saddles and pack saddles. Riding saddles were used by those who rode creatures, whilst pack saddles were frames used to carry equipment.) Military saddles were also available, and were used by commanders and generals in battle. Exotic saddles were used to mount specific types of creatures, such as aquatic and aerial mounts.

These seats were sold all over [[Faer√ªn]], [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]].

Saddles specifically made for camels had different names in [[Zakhara]] and were known as '''''kharj''''', '''''rahla''''', and '''''terke'''''. The ''rahla'' was small, comfortable and lightweight, whilst the ''terke'' was cage-like and enabled the rider to control the camel much more easily.

As well as animals, mechanical machines such as the [[Leaping Lizard]] of [[Raven's Bluff]], were seated with saddles. Citizens of the city could mount the ride for 2 [[cp]] each.

Saddle frames were often made of wood or [[sheep]]skin. Saddles were sold by ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', and each of them were made from black [[Ordulin|Ordulan]] leather. 

Saddles manufactured in [[Calimshan]] had especially tall [[Wiktionary:cantle|cantles]].

===Mounts===
{{Quote
|Nothing makes me feel better than soaring over the landscape, keeping an eye out for [[Zhent]] dangers. Except maybe for knocking a [[Zhentarim skymage]] out of his saddle, of course
|[[Joatra Stelmar]], a [[Moonsea skysentinel]]
}}
Such seats came in a multitude of varieties, each different depending on the rider's needs or the type of mount used. Types of mounts that used saddles were [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, [[wolf|wolves]],{{cite book/Volo's Guide to Monsters|42}} [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[steeder]]s, [[pegasi]], [[dragon]]s, [[giant strider]]s, and [[camel]]s. Even [[dolphin]]s could have saddles fitted to them, as well as [[owlbear]]s, [[axebeak]]s, [[hippocampi]], [[purple worm]]s, [[giant firefly|giant fireflies]], [[giant lizard]]s, [[veserab]]s, [[pteranadon]]s, [[giant raven]]s, [[wyvern]]s, [[stone flyer]]s, [[nightmare]]s, and [[carrion crawler]]s.

===Usage===
{{Quote
|The following day we finished the ride to [[Corwell]], none too soon for my tastes. I would almost have preferred to travel by coracle, for the saddle sores stung for another week.
|[[Elminster]]
}}

Traveling on saddles (particularly poor ones) for long periods could cause bad sores.

Instead of making saddles from scratch, [[arcane]] methods could be used. The ''[[mount]]'' [[spell]] could summon creatures with saddles already attached to them, or even [[howdah]]s, should the caster be powerful enough. Even the ''[[phantom steed]]'' spell summoned a ghostly mount with a saddle and [[bit and bridle]] to boot.

==History==
Saddles first became available in [[Netheril]] in {{YearlinkConvert|890|NY}}.

[[1345 DR]] was known as the Year of the Saddle. The [[High Herald]] of [[Yartar]] was known as the Gold Saddle. In addition, the settlement of [[Lheshayl]] had an inn known as the [[Saddle of the Plains]], [[Hill's Edge]] featured an inn called the [[Stone Saddle]], and a body of water in [[Longsaddle]] was known as the [[Saddle Pond]].

==Notable Saddles==
[[File:GiantStrider-2e.gif|thumb|273px|''A [[giant strider]] wearing a saddle.'']]
There were many notable saddles of the Realms, including those that could fit exotic beasts of all shapes and sizes. Some notable saddles were:

* The ''[[flying saddle of Thamos]]'', a [[magic]] saddle from [[Cormyr]].

* A ''[[saddle of the cavalier]]'', a wondrous item favored by riders.

* A military saddle from [[Shadowdale]] had a huge [[black opal]] embedded into it. It was worth 1,000 [[gp]].

==Notable Owners==
* Lord [[Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV]] owned a saddle that was modified with several attachments. His saddle held not only his [[bow]] and [[silver]] [[arrow]]s, but also [[javelin]]s in special scabbards.
* [[Chuqali Shilai]]'s headquarters, the [[nom-satakon erughe]], housed a number of saddles.

==Notable Producers of Saddles==
[[File:Saddlemaker's Workshop.png|thumb|273px|''The workshop of a saddlemaker.'']]
* [[Calishite]]-crafted saddles were masterfully made. Their design appeared rugged but was highly functional and comfortable for both the horse and the rider.
* [[Keltar]] was well known for its production of saddles. Their saddles had such a good reputation that they were desired by every [[Calishite]] horseman. One of the great crafters of Keltar claimed he could custom-make saddles for dragons.
* [[Mosstone]] was a notable producer and exporter of saddles.

==Trivia==
In the [[Roll of Years]], the year [[1345 DR]] bore the name "Year of the Saddle".<ref>
