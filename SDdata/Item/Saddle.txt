A saddle was a seat attached to a creature, either for riding or carrying objects.

Saddles were mainly split into two groups riding saddles and pack saddles. Riding saddles were used by those who rode creatures, whilst pack saddles were frames used to carry equipment.) Military saddles were also available, and were used by commanders and generals in battle. Exotic saddles were used to mount specific types of creatures, such as aquatic and aerial mounts.
These seats were sold all over Faer√ªn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara.
Saddles specifically made for camels had different names in Zakhara and were known as kharj, rahla, and terke. The rahla was small, comfortable and lightweight, whilst the terke was cage-like and enabled the rider to control the camel much more easily.
As well as animals, mechanical machines such as the Leaping Lizard of Ravens Bluff, were seated with saddles. Citizens of the city could mount the ride for 2 cp each.
Saddle frames were often made of wood or sheepskin. Saddles were sold by Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, and each of them were made from black Ordulan leather. 
Saddles manufactured in Calimshan had especially tall cantles.
Such seats came in a multitude of varieties, each different depending on the riders needs or the type of mount used. Types of mounts that used saddles were horses, mules, wolves, griffons, hippogriffs, steeders, pegasi, dragons, giant striders, and camels. Even dolphins could have saddles fitted to them, as well as owlbears, axebeaks, hippocampi, purple worms, giant fireflies, giant lizards, veserabs, pteranadons, giant ravens, wyverns, stone flyers, nightmares, and carrion crawlers.
Traveling on saddles (particularly poor ones) for long periods could cause bad sores.
Instead of making saddles from scratch, arcane methods could be used. The mount spell could summon creatures with saddles already attached to them, or even howdahs, should the caster be powerful enough. Even the phantom steed spell summoned a ghostly mount with a saddle and bit and bridle to boot.
Saddles first became available in Netheril in .
