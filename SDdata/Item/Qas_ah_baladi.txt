The '''''qas'ah baladi''''' ({{Pronounce|KAh|sah|_|bah|LAH|dee}}) was a large [[Zakhara]]n kettle [[drum]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

==Description==
These drums were crafted from fire-hardened clay. Tough hides were usually used to cover their heads, though sometimes extremely thin metal was used. The large size of the ''qas'ah baladi'' made it inconvenient to transport.

==History==
''Qas'ah baladi'' were used by [[mamluk]]s throughout the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] and often saw use in [[Hiyal]] and [[Huzuz]] when important announcements were needed.
