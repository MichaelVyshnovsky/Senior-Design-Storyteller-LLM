Additionally, it had the ''dreadful hewer'' enchantment that made the wielder's spells and abilities that caused ''[[fear]]'' dramatically easy to take hold of the opponents' hearts. Lastly, the shield also expanded the wielder's magical capabilities, allowing them to memorize one additional simple spell of an [[arcane]] of [[divine]] nature.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''blackguard's greaves'' were worn by the guardian death knight called [[That Which Guards]], who, along with [[That Which Guards]] and [[That Which Lurks (death knight)|That Which Lurks]], guarded the entrance to the chamber of the [[Bhaalist]] [[Murder Tribunal]] in the [[Undercellar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
