A staff (or stave) was a pole-shaped implement used by various races as a walking stick or weapon, or sometimes as a spellcasting focus. They often had magical properties or abilities.
Typical staffs were usually  long. They were typically made of crystal, metal, or wood, and varied wildly in appearance. Most staffs could also be used as quarterstaffs.
The height of a staff was roughly the same as the height of the intended user and the diameter was such that it could be grasped comfortably in the hand. Some stavesThe plural, staves, is used almost everywhere in D&D literature but staffs is also acceptable. were tapered, becoming slightly narrower at the top. Often staves were metal bound on one or both ends and they could be perfectly straight or gnarly and twisted. Runes, patterns and other decorations often personalized a staff to its owner.
Ornately carved staves and walking sticks were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, as well as specially ordered cane heads.
Staves could be used to channel the spellcasting powers of druids, sorcerers, warlocks or wizards, aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using a staff as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary material components required for a spell.
