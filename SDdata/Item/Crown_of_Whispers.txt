The '''''Crowns of Whispers''''', also known as the '''bridal crowns of Aliia''',

==Description==
Each circlet was made of [[gold]] and was decorated with three [[star ruby|star rubies]] on the front. Three points adorned the top, one raising above each of the wearer's temples and the third raising from the center of the forehead.

==Powers==
Anyone who wore a ''Crown of Whispers'' instantly became a better negotiator, both becoming more diplomatic and better able to intuit the concerns and thoughts of others.
Additionally, once per day the wearer was able to further enhance their powers of persuasion or any [[magic]] intended to charm someone.

==History==
The matching ''Crowns'' were crafted in the {{YearlinkName|926}} for the coronation of Princess [[Aliia]] of [[Impiltur]]. One was for her while its twin was for her fianc√©e and consort, Prince [[Rhiigard Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]]. The union would cement a powerful bond between Impiltur and Cormyr, and the ''Crowns'' were crafted to signify the dual role that the two kingdoms would have in each others' rule.

However, the ''Crowns'' were lost beneath the [[Inner Sea]] when the ship transporting them to the wedding, ''[[Nadyra's Glory]]'', sank mysteriously about {{SI|30|miles|k|long=yes}} off-course. Also lost in the shipwreck was Aliia's life as well as two other storied [[magic items]]: the ''[[Greatsword of Impiltur]]'' and ''[[Kimeltaar]]'', the "Demonsbane Shield". 

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], both ''Crowns'' along with the ''Greatsword of Impiltur'' had been recovered from the wreck by the [[succubus]] [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]], the so-called "Queen of Whispers", who kept them in the [[Giantspire Mountains]]. It was under her ownership that the two crowns came to be known as the ''Crowns of Whispers''.

When the [[Spellplague]] struck in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Soneillon was torn away from [[Toril]], leaving behind the ''Crowns'' and the ''Greatsword'' to be claimed by her former minions, the [[hobgoblin]]s of the Giantspires.

==Reputation==
The ''Crowns of Whispers'' were storied and legendary objects by the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Notable Owners==
* Princess [[Aliia]] of Impiltur in the 10{{th}} century DR.
* [[Soneillon]] in the 14{{th}} century DR.
* Queen [[Maaqua]] and Chief [[Aruugan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
