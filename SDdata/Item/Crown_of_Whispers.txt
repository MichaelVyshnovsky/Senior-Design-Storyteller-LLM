The Crowns of Whispers, also known as the bridal crowns of Aliia,
Each circlet was made of gold and was decorated with three star rubies on the front. Three points adorned the top, one raising above each of the wearers temples and the third raising from the center of the forehead.
Anyone who wore a Crown of Whispers instantly became a better negotiator, both becoming more diplomatic and better able to intuit the concerns and thoughts of others.
Additionally, once per day the wearer was able to further enhance their powers of persuasion or any magic intended to charm someone.
The matching Crowns were crafted in the  for the coronation of Princess Aliia of Impiltur. One was for her while its twin was for her fianc√©e and consort, Prince Rhiigard Obarskyr of Cormyr. The union would cement a powerful bond between Impiltur and Cormyr, and the Crowns were crafted to signify the dual role that the two kingdoms would have in each others rule.
However, the Crowns were lost beneath the Inner Sea when the ship transporting them to the wedding, Nadyras Glory, sank mysteriously about  off-course. Also lost in the shipwreck was Aliias life as well as two other storied magic items the Greatsword of Impiltur and Kimeltaar, the "Demonsbane Shield". 
By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, both Crowns along with the Greatsword of Impiltur had been recovered from the wreck by the succubus demon lord Soneillon, the so-called "Queen of Whispers", who kept them in the Giantspire Mountains. It was under her ownership that the two crowns came to be known as the Crowns of Whispers.
When the Spellplague struck in the , Soneillon was torn away from Toril, leaving behind the Crowns and the Greatsword to be claimed by her former minions, the hobgoblins of the Giantspires.
The Crowns of Whispers were storied and legendary objects by the late 15 century DR.
