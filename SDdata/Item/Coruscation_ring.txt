'''''Coruscation rings''''' were [[enchanted]] bands that allowed the spellcasting wearer to illuminate targets with ''[[radiating orbs]]''.

==Description==
These simple [[ring]]s' counters bore engravings that projected provocative lights.

==Powers==
The ''arcane radiance'' enchantment weaved into these items added additional effects to the wearer's damage-dealing [[spell]]s. All targets that were damaged by the wearer's spells were immediately illuminated by ''radiating orbs'' above their heads that showered them in bright light, making them visible, vulnerable, and exposed. The radiance lasted for twelve seconds.

==History==
One such item was hidden behind a secret wall in the ''[[Last Light Inn]]'', presumably before the [[Sharran]] [[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow-curse]] consumed the lands around the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]]. That ''coruscation ring'' was still hidden at the inn in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
