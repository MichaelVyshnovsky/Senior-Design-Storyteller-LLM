        "mainbody": "'''Gogondy''', also known as '''gorgondy wine''', was a [[deep gnome|deep gnomish]] [[wine]] made from water drawn from the [[Fountains of Memory]]. Those who drank it were oftentimes granted visions.",
        "Description": "Gogondy was crimson-colored, supposedly due to it containing powdered [[ruby]]. It had a notably intoxicating aroma.",
        "Powers": "A glass of Gogondy could grant its imbiber the effects of any of a number of [[divination]] [[spell]]s, including ''[[vision]]'' and ''[[contact other plane]]''. The latter effect could either bring the drinker in contact with either the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] or an [[intermediate deity]] of the [[Outer Planes]]. However, rather than enjoying these benefits, it was noted that [[human]]s could fall into a coma or even die from even one glass of the drink."
