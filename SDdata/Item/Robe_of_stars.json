        "Description": "These robes were often woven with dark blue or black fabric and decorated with embroidery of silvery stars or ''[[rune]]s''.",
        "Powers": "In addition to offering defense against magical effects along with physical protection, in some cases in a manner similar to a suit of ''[[leather armor]],''  a ''robe of stars'' allowed its wearer to readily travel to the [[Astral Plane]].\n\nUp to six of the embroidered stars on the robe could be removed and either thrown in a manner similar to [[shuriken]], or released as ''[[magic missile]]s''. A number of these stars reappeared on the robe each day at dusk.\n\nSome of these robes were capable of producing extremely bright light and would never get dirty or wet.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1715}}"
