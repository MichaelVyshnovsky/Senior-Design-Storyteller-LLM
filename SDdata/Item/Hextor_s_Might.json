        "mainbody": "Hextors Might was one of three ancient artifacts that bore the name of Hextor, a deity of Oerth.\nHextors Might was a vicious-looking ponderous two-handed warhammer, similar in design with its two sibling weapons.\nHextors Might possessed a +2 enchantment along with magic that drastically increased the users fortitude, making them resistant to  health-affecting spells and various diseases.\nThe mysterious trio of Hextor-blessed weapons dated back to the time of pre-Weeping War Myth Drannor. All trees ended up being stashed in three armored chests within the Halls of Stone of the Dwarven Dungeons of the City of Song. The chests were secured and protected from lock picking and other attempts of retrieving their contents. Eventually, Dwarven Dungeons entirety was sealed off during the destruction of Myth Drannor in 714 DR to protect the dwarven tombs, artifacts, and several evil and malicious magical items hidden within. The dungeons would end up being unsealed by 1369 DR, and subsequently, a trio of orc rogues found the keys to liberate Hextors vicious arms."
