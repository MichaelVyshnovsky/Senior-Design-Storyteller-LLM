        "mainbody": "A '''''wand of secrets''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[wand]] that had the power to reveal hidden passages and traps.",
        "Description": "Like other magical wands, ''wands of secrets'' were typically around {{SI|15|in|c|long=yes}} long.",
        "Powers": "When activated, the ''wand of secrets'' detected the nearest secret door or trap within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. If there was one, the wand pulsed and pointed directly towards it.\n\nThis power could be used up to three times a day, after which the wand gradually recovered its magic at each successive dawn.\n\nSome wands also exhibited a second power: by whispering a secret to themselves, the wielder could cause the tip of the wand to glow with magical light. This power only worked if the whispered secret was never shared with anyone else.{{Cite adventurers league/The Map with No Names|27}}"
