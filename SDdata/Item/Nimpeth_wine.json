The price of Nimpeth wine increased the further one traveled away from the point of its origin, and due to its quality and popularity, it was in high demand.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Nimpeth wine shipments were among the favorite things to shop on for the huge dragon turtle that inhabited the waters of the Deepwash. During the same period of time, Nimpeth wine was a common \"greetings gift\" in Turmish, the tradition that dictated that a visitor was to bring a gift for the host as gratitude for their hospitality."
