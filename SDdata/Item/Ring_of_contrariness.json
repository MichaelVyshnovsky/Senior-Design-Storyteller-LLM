        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of contrariness''''' were a variety of [[curse]]d [[ring]]s that imbued their wearers' with an urge to act in opposition of others.",
        "Powers": "Those who wore a ''ring of contrariness'' were unable to agree with any idea, statement, or action given by another individual. However, this effect could not compel the wearer to harm themselves or take actions that would obviously harm them. Therefore, if contradicting an idea, statement, or action would result in the wearer harming themselves—such as someone telling the wearer to not hit themselves in the head—then the wearer would instead direct that harm towards someone else.\n\nIn addition to their contrarian effect, these rings displayed a [[spell]]-like ability that varied with each ring. The known spells that a ''ring of contrariness'' could display included ''[[fly]]ing'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', and ''[[strength]]''.\n\nLike other cursed items, it could not be removed from its wearer until affected by ''[[remove curse]]'', but due to the ring's contrarian nature the wearer would resist any attempts to cast that spell upon them.",
        "History": "These rings existed as far back as the [[Netherese Empire]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[blue dragon]] [[Araugauthos]]'s treasure hoard in [[Undermountain]] included a ''ring of contrariness''.<ref>\n* [[Zu'l Janah]], a large [[dragonne]] in the land of [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|36}}"
