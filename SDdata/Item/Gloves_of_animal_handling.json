        "mainbody": "Gloves of animal handling were enchanted gloves created by Shaarans to aid them in handling their steeds.\nGloves of animal handling could be created with enchantments of three power levels, normal, greater, and epic. Each pair possessed the power to establish a direct link to the beasts mind and granting the user enhanced animal empathy.\nGloves of animal handling originated from the human Shaaran tribes. Their culture and livelihood depended on their ability to tame, train, and ride their wild horses and the most skilled beast handlers possessed these gloves. During the tribes raids, they always kept their eyes open searching for the other tribes beast tamer. An extra pair of these precious items was always welcome.\nThroughout the late 14 century, gloves of animal handling could be found in the areas surrounding Neverwinter."
