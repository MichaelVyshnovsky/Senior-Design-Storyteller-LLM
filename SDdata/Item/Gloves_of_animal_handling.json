        "mainbody": "''Gloves of animal handling'' were enchanted gloves created by [[Shaaran]]s to aid them in handling their [[horse|steeds]].",
        "Powers": "''Gloves of animal handling'' could be created with enchantments of three power levels, normal, ''greater'', and ''epic''. Each pair possessed the power to establish a direct link to the beast's mind and granting the user enhanced animal empathy.",
        "History": "''Gloves of animal handling'' originated from the [[human]] Shaaran tribes. Their culture and livelihood depended on their ability to tame, train, and ride their wild horses and the most skilled beast handlers possessed these gloves. During the tribes' raids, they always kept their eyes open searching for the other tribe's beast tamer. An extra pair of these precious items was always welcome.\n\nThroughout the late 14{{th}} century, ''gloves of animal handling'' could be found in the areas surrounding [[Neverwinter]]."
