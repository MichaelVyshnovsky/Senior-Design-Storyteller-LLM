Frostkiss Ale was a type of aged ale found in the Western Heartlands, along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Frostkiss was named after the cold goddess Auril, the Frostmaiden, and was cold and sour to taste just like the deitys demeanor. This ale was aged for several years before being consumed.
