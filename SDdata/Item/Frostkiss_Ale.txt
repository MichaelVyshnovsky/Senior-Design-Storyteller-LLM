'''Frostkiss Ale''' was a type of aged [[ale]] found in the [[Western Heartlands]], along the [[River Chionthar]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Frostkiss was named after the cold goddess [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden, and was cold and sour to taste just like the deity's demeanor. This ale was aged for several years before being consumed.
