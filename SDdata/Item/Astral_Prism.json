        "mainbody": "The '''Astral Prism''', also referred to as '''the weapon''' or '''mysterious artifact''', was the name given to a powerful [[gith]] device that appeared in the Realms during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|My power grows. My forces gather. The reckoning draws near...|[[The Absolute]], in defiance when confronted by the artifact.}}",
        "Description": "It appeared as a spiked, black [[iron]] icosahedron inscribed with glyphs of the [[Gith language]].\n\nAccording to a githyanki disk found within the Prism itself, it was of infernal design and was part of a deal made between [[Vlaakith I]] and a [[devil]].",
        "Powers": "{{Quote|...the artifact has a will of its own, and powers to enforce it.|Shadowheart.}}\nThe Astral Prism functioned as both a prison and a navigation device, leading to a pocket [[plane]] within the [[Astral Plane]], where [[Vlaakith CLVII]] imprisoned the Prince of the Comet, [[Orpheus]], the son of the original [[githyanki]] leader [[Gith]] herself. In addition, the artifact was able to project a field that disrupted [[illithid]] [[psionics]] due to the imprisoned Orpheus and his powers, freeing them from [[the Absolute]]'s influence, making it a significant existential threat to the Grand Design and the Absolute's ambitions.",
        "History": "[[File:Mysterious Artefact bg3.png|thumb|''The enigmatic Astral Prism.'']]\nIn or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Church of Shar]] heard whispers of rivals, particularly the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. In the process of gathering information, they learned of an artifact vital to countering [[the Absolute]]'s rising influence and highly feared by it, and learned of the Astral Prism's whereabouts by torturing a githyanki. The Sharran priestess [[Shadowheart]] was sent by her superiors on a mission to retrieve the item and return it to [[Baldur's Gate]] immediately, and she successfully recovered it.\n\nAround the same time, mind flayer known as [[the Emperor]] was sent aboard a regrown [[Nautiloid]] to retrieve the Astral Prism, successfully locating it before others.<ref group=\"note\">It should be noted that the Emperor only claims that he was the first to find it. Contact with the Prism gave him a newfound sense of free will, allowing him to resist the telepathic control of the Elder Brain and break free.\n\nShadowheart was waylaid, however, when she was taken captive aboard a mind flayer [[nautiloid]], implanted with a modified illithid tadpole, and forced to endure a trip across the [[plane]]s. After traveling through [[Avernus]] and the [[Shadowfell]], the nautiloid returned to the [[Prime Material plane]], and crashed on the continent of [[Faer√ªn]] on [[Toril]], fortunately mere miles away from Baldur's Gate.\n\nThereafter, the artifact was sought after by various groups, including the githyanki Kith'rak [[Voss]], on behalf of Queen [[Vlaakith CLVII]] to retrieve it, and the three [[chosen]] of Cult of the Absolute."
