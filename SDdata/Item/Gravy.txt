{{quote|''With stew, you want a plain bread you can use to sop up the gravy. One with a lot of bite to the crust, but soft inside.''|[[Emilo Haversack]] of [[Krynn]]}}

==Description==
There existed different types of gravies, but they generally all shared similar methods of preparation. Some additional flavorings to gravies varied from [[wine]],{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|32}} to [[pea]]s, [[spice]]s, and [[herb]]s.

==Availability==
===The Sword Coast===

In the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], the gravy was an eatery common sight. Hot buns filled with [[mussels]] and gravy were one of the available dishes, such as roasted [[squab]] with rustic [[rosemary]] gravy. Sliced [[sausage]]s in gravy was a more humble meal in Waterdeep, one of the places one could purchase the dish was [[Zestra's Hot Soups]]. In a nearby village of [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]], [[Ammakyl Flowers and Foods]] sold meat skewers dipped in gravy.

Further north, in the city of [[Neverwinter]], gravy was sometimes served with a thin stew of greens or atop a mound of [[mashed potatoes]].

Down south alongside the [[Sword Coast]], gravy was sold to sailor customers of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], ladled over [[nutbread]] and alongside [[cheese handwheel]]s. Other dishes that included gravy in the area included [[poutine]], a mound of fried [[potato]]es doused in gravy and curds, pork loin cooked with [[apple]] and [[cider]] gravy, and roasted beef in [[mustard]] and gravy.

The city of [[Crimmor]] in [[Amn]] was home to [[The Old Wheel]] tavern known for its rich wine gravies.

In [[Tethyr]], [[Blackthorn's Brew]], a festhall in [[Velen]], served [[Sunsplash]], a salad of [[cheese]], [[fern]]s, [[lettuce]] and gravy. In [[Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House]] of [[Mosstone]], [[chicken]] was stuffed with breads and [[onion]]s and served in a chaotic smattering of gravies and sauces, while the [[Drover's Last Drink]] sold pies filled with gravy. Further south, in the [[Calishite]] town of [[Tulmon]], gravies were used to cover tough overcooked meals served at [[Havalanker's Tavern]].

===Interior and North Faerûn===
In [[Cormyr]]

In the [[Dalelands]], gravy was a usual condiment served with [[roast boar]] and roasted [[phledge]], a local ground-partridge, was accompanied by thick pea gravy.

Across the [[Dragon Reach]] from the Dalelands, gravy was common in the Vast. Namely, stag in gravy was served at [[The Jellied Eel]], a renowned restaurant in [[Ravens Bluff]], and spiced gravies were found on [[Sword Tables Dining Lounge]]'s menu.

===South and East Faerûn===
In the [[Old Empires]], [[spicy]] gravy was consumed in [[Unther]], and sometimes was served as a smallbite.

===Other Regions===
Even the [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]] appreciated a good gravy. They served [[rothé]] roasts with [[mushroom]] gravy and a recipe for mushroom gravy was recorded in the ''[[Cookbooks of the Underdark]]'', recovered from a ruin in [[the Vast]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Crawl|18}}

==History==
Gravy was an ancient type of sauce that was consumed as far back as the [[Empire of Netheril]]

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], bread soaked in simple gravy was a meal served to slaves of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that were forced to excavate the ruins of Myth Drannor under the command of [[Kya Mordrayn]].
