A '''kawanaga''' ({{Pronounce|kah|wah|nah|gah|refs=}}) was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The kawanaga served as both a versatile tool and a weapon. It consisted of a length of rope at least {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length, featuring a grappling hook on one end and a weight on the other. Its functionality extended to climbing and combat, allowing for striking or entangling opponents with the hook or weight. [[Ninja]]s favored this weapon for its multi-purpose nature and ease of concealment, making it a popular choice among their arsenal.
