        "mainbody": "A '''garnache''' was a type of outer-garment found in the Realms.",
        "Description": "The garnache was best described as being a sort of long [[cloak]] with wide [[cape]]-like, elbow-length sleeves. It covered the wearer from their neck down to their ankles. The sleeve design of a garnache allowed bulky items (like pouches or weapons) to be hidden beneath them without attracting attention to the wearer.",
        "Notable Users": "* Many [[fighter]]s and [[thieves]] favored the garnache due to the ease with which they could hide things in it without hindering their movement.\n* In the nation of [[Tethyr]], the garnache was common garment among [[wizard]]s.<ref>"
