        "mainbody": "A '''\"lich's coffin\"''' was a term given to a  special box designed to imprison an [[undeath|undying]] [[lich]].",
        "Known Lich's Coffins": "In the [[1056 DR|Year of the Laughing Dead, 1056 DR]], the lich [[Anthilar]] was severely incapacitated after a [[spell]]-battle in the streets of [[Tashluta]] in the [[Tashalar]]. Unconscious, he was trapped inside a lich's coffin and shipped north out of the city. His [[phylactery]] was not located. The intended destination was the [[Skullspire]], a temple to [[Myrkul]], the god of the dead, in [[Tulmon]] near the [[Lake of Steam]], where the senior priests of the [[Conclave of Doom]] desired to study the lich. It never got there, and the lich's coffin changed ownership many times until at last it became part of the hoard of the [[mercury dragon]] [[Tostyn Alaerthmaugh]] in the [[Evermoors]]. It lay there, still unopened by [[1374 DR]].",
        "Description": "Anthilar's lich's coffin was fashioned from metal and described as massively armored. It levitated and stood upright. Tostyn was unable to open it by [[1374 DR]]."
