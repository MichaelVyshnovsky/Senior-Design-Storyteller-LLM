The '''''Foundation of Flame''''' was a pair of [[magic]] [[boots]] crafted by [[Havilar]] for her twin sister [[Farideh]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
As the wearer of boots walked, the ''Foundation of Flame'' created an [[illusion]] akin to a heat shimmer around the wearer, making it harder for their enemies to target them accurately. The effect was so potent at misleading onlookers that its power was likened to that of a ''[[mass suggestion]]'' spell.

==Notable Owners==
* Farideh, a [[tiefling]] [[warlock]] who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
