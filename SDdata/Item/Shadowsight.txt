Shadowsight was a set of magical goggles found in Wheloon Prison in the mid-1480s DR.
Shadowsight was attuned with the Shadowfell, and gave the wearer the ability to hit ethereal and insubstantial creatures like shadows and ghosts consistently. It also broadly improved their perceptiveness and aiming ability.
The goggles were recovered by Cormyrean forces after defeating Archwizard Tyrvus at Oldstone Hall in Wheloon Prison.
