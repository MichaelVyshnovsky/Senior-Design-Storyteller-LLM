'''''Shadowsight''''' was a set of magical [[goggles]] found in [[Wheloon Prison]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Powers==
''Shadowsight'' was attuned with the [[Shadowfell]], and gave the wearer the ability to hit ethereal and insubstantial creatures like [[shadow]]s and [[ghost]]s consistently. It also broadly improved their perceptiveness and aiming ability.

==History==
The goggles were recovered by [[Cormyr]]ean forces after defeating Archwizard [[Tyrvus]] at [[Oldstone Hall]] in Wheloon Prison.
