A talisman of adaptation was a magical jewel that altered the physiology of an aquatic creature, allowing the wearer to breathe air and survive outside water for one week.
It took the form of a multicolored coral pendant.
This talisman allowed a water-dweller to breathe air and to suffer no penalty for being outside water. Its effect lasted for one week, after which the talisman lost all its power, becoming a mundane decorative object. 
Crafting one required a water breathing spell.
