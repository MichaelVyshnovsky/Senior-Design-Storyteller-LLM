A '''''talisman of adaptation''''' was a magical jewel that altered the physiology of an aquatic creature, allowing the wearer to breathe air and survive outside water for one week.

==Description==
It took the form of a multicolored [[coral]] pendant.

==Powers==
This talisman allowed a water-dweller to breathe air and to suffer no penalty for being outside water. Its effect lasted for one week, after which the talisman lost all its power, becoming a mundane decorative object. 

==Creation==
Crafting one required a ''[[water breathing]]'' spell.
