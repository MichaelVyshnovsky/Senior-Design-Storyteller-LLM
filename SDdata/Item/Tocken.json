        "mainbody": "tocken was a set of wooden carved oval open-ended bells that could be played either with hammers or open handed. There was also a version that used silver bells that was popular in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.\nWooden tockens were often made of phandar. Tockens were usually mounted hanging from a crossbeam of cane or a wooden branch (sometimes the whole thing was attached to a pole) and struck with mallets. Their sound was very pleasant and brought out subtle tones from the wood,\nWooden tockens were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\n* William Windsprinter, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, had a tocken made of phandar as his favorite instrument."
