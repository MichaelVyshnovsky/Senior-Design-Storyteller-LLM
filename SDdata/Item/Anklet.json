        "mainbody": "Anklets were decorative jewelry worn around the ankles of women in Zakhara.\nAnklets could be rather common or incredibly ornate. Precious metal and jewels were often used in their construction. The women of Zakhara used them as a sign of vanity. Bells were often attached so that a prestigious woman could be heard before she was seen.\nThe price of anklets varied depending on the metal used and the presence of inset stones. A common price range for common anklets was 5–15 gp while ornate anklets sold for 30–60 gp.\nAnklet of dancing An enchanted variety of Serôsian anklets that had an effect similar to boots of dancing.\nSwift-Swimming Anklets of Osura A unique, powerful enchanted Serôsian anklet that was created by the wizard Nyratiis.\n* Members of the Church of Milil often wore metal chimes as anklets.\n* Members of the Church of Lliira were sometimes known to wear anklets.\n* Many members of the Church of Tymora were known to wear smaller holy symbols as anklets."
