        "mainbody": "A '''''dead box''''' was a container that prevented the properties of the contents from being detected by any normal or [[magic]]al means.",
        "Description": "These boxes could be of any size (ranging from tiny [[coffer]]s to entire rooms), but the sides of the ''dead box'' had to be made of solid slabs of [[atharstone]]. This made them both very durable and very, very heavy for their size. The sides were further sealed with a mixture of natural [[rubber]] and [[gorgon]] blood.",
        "Powers": "A ''dead box'' negated any and all efforts to detect the presence of magic, aura, [[alignment]], temperature, ''etc.'' coming from inside the box. For this power to function properly, the box had to be airtight shut.\n\nAs in [[mortar]], the use of gorgon blood in the construction process likely helped block [[scrying]] and certain eavesdropping [[spell]]s.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}} It might also mean that the walls could be warded against [[astral plane|astral]] and [[ethereal plane|ethereal]] travel.",
        "History": "It was said that the name \"dead box\" originated both as a reference to the item's magic-deadening properties as well as a promise of what might happen to anyone foolish enough to hide inside of one to escape detection.",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[Droon]], a clan of [[spelljamming]] [[kobold]]s, kept a stash of food and water as well as a ''[[Spelljamming helm|minor helm]]'' in a ''dead box'' at [[Greenshield]] near [[Realmspace]]."
