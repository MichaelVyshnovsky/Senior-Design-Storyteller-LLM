        "mainbody": "dead box was a container that prevented the properties of the contents from being detected by any normal or magical means.\nThese boxes could be of any size (ranging from tiny coffers to entire rooms), but the sides of the dead box had to be made of solid slabs of atharstone. This made them both very durable and very, very heavy for their size. The sides were further sealed with a mixture of natural rubber and gorgon blood.\nA dead box negated any and all efforts to detect the presence of magic, aura, alignment, temperature, etc. coming from inside the box. For this power to function properly, the box had to be airtight shut.\nAs in mortar, the use of gorgon blood in the construction process likely helped block scrying and certain eavesdropping spells. It might also mean that the walls could be warded against astral and ethereal travel.\nIt was said that the name \"dead box\" originated both as a reference to the items magic-deadening properties as well as a promise of what might happen to anyone foolish enough to hide inside of one to escape detection.\n* The Droon, a clan of spelljamming kobolds, kept a stash of food and water as well as a minor helm in a dead box at Greenshield near Realmspace."
