The '''''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar''''' ({{Pronounce|dal|vur|NAR|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was a collection of [[magic]]al teeth discovered by and named for [[Dahlver-Nar]], a [[human]] [[cleric]] and [[binder]].

==Description==
The ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' were all associated with different powerful individuals or legendary stories. The individual teeth were as wildly varied as their associated owners. Some teeth were human in origin, others resembled long [[snake]] fangs, [[gemstone]]s, or tusks. For those so inclined, it was possible to implant individual ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar''; the teeth would change their size (to a degree) to accommodate their new host's mouth.

The teeth were kept inside a [[leather]] [[pouch]] decorated with stitched images of various heroes and lightly fanciful creatures.

===Destruction===
It was possible to destroy the individual ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'', though scholars disagreed on the exact procedure. Some claimed the only way was to soak the teeth in ''[[sweet water]]'' for a thousand years, letting them slowly rot away. Another version maintained the teeth must all be implanted into the mouth of a conscious ancient red dragon without explanation. A third version claimed the teeth must be bathed in the breaths of thirty-two different dragons over the course of thirty-two days.

In yet another version, the individual teeth had to be planted in the areas where their associated tales originated. Whatever the case truly was, seemingly destroyed ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' had a tendency to re-appear at some later date.

==Powers==
The primary way of gaining the powers of the ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' was to implant them in place of one's own teeth. Although it was possible to have more than one tooth implanted at a time, legends claimed that implanting too many of them could lead to madness. Some accounts maintained that in order to implant a ''tooth of Dahlver-Nar'', it was first necessary to extract one's natural tooth by force. In other versions, placing a ''tooth of Dahlver-Nar'' in one's mouth would simply remove the user's original tooth and its place would be taken automatically.

Alternately, some of the teeth could be planted in the ground to either produce the effects of a [[spell]] or to summon certain creatures associated with the individual tooth.

==List of teeth==
Each individual ''tooth of Dahlver-Nar'' was a unique item with its own associated magical effects. At least three sets of teeth were documented by scholars, although this could simply be a reflection of the roster of teeth changing over time.

===Incendax's Teeth===
This set of thirty-two [[red dragon]] teeth was associated with the story of how Dahlver-Nar found the teeth in the lair of the red dragon Incendax. Rather than each individual tooth having a unique power, these teeth granted their wielder (indeed, no implantation was required) several powers associated with dragons: the ability to speak [[Draconic]], immunity to harmful fire, and the ability to sense all [[gems]] and precious metals in their vicinity. Also, the tooth-bearer could invoke a cone of magical fire from his or her palm.

Additionally, Incendax's teeth could be planted in the ground to produce yet more magical effects. Planting the non-molar teeth allowed for the summoning of powerful creatures such as [[fire giant]]s, [[remorhaz]]es, and [[wyvern]]s. Planting the molars allowed their wielder to cast a semi-random spell, ranging from ''[[teleport without error]]'' to ''[[disintegrate]]'' to ''[[domination]]''.

However, the wielder of the teeth quickly fell victim to an insidious [[curse]] that turned them evil and prone to hoarding treasure (especially the teeth themselves), and to feel compelled to establish a lair in a cave somewhere.

===Pact Magic Teeth===
All the teeth in this set were associated with powerful souls capable of granting powers to their servants.<ref group="note" name="Vestige">''Tome of Magic'' uses the term "vestige" for these pact-granting soul entities. In the [[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition|5th edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide'']], "vestige" refers to a dead or forgotten deity, and so the term is avoided here. Implanting one of these teeth linked the wielder's mind and body to that specific soul. These powerful souls would occasionally attempt to influence the tooth-bearer; this influence could be resisted but doing so generally led to adverse effects. Additionally, implanting a tooth associated with a powerful soul caused the tooth-ee to display physical signs associated with that soul, such as teeth growing from one's scalp

==History==
Who created the ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' was completely unknown, as was the process for making them. While it was universally accepted that Dahlver-Nar discovered the teeth, several versions of the story existed. In one version, Dahlver-Nar was a novice cleric who chanced upon the teeth while exploring the lair of the dead red dragon Incendax, who had been destroyed by (and in turn destroyed) thirteen [[archmage]]s. In this rendition, all the ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' belonged to the dead dragon.

In another version, Dahlver-Nar was a supremely powerful cleric favored by the gods. When he died, his teeth were imbued with great magic and were treated as holy relics by his followers.

A third version was told among binder scholars. Here, Dahlver-Nar was a cleric who forsook his divine calling to gain power through [[Warlock#Warlock pacts|pact magic]], and who grew obsessed with the teeth after discovering them. These scholars maintained that the teeth were not Dahlver-Nar's own, nor did they belong to a dragon, but were instead associated with souls that had grown powerful enough to grant powers through others via pacts.<ref group="note" name="Vestige" />

==Reputation==
Many people believed that the ''Teeth of Dahlver-Nar'' were used by malevolent forces to control the minds and actions of those who implanted them. They were correct.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Dahlver-Nar]], who discovered the teeth and became so obsessed with them that his soul gained tooth-themed powers in the afterlife.
