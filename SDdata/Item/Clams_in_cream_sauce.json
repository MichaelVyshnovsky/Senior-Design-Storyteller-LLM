        "mainbody": "'''Clams''' or '''oysters in cream sauce''' was an [[elf|elven]] seafood dish found in the [[Northwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "This dish was made using [[oyster]]s or [[clam]]s that were steamed in [[beer]]. The cream sauce itself was a white condiment of [[dill]], [[leek]]s, and [[chive]]s. Traditional elven dishes were not made with [[onion]]s or [[garlic]] as the Fair Folk consider their flavor to be overpowering and usually just reserved as \"wayfaring staples\" to mask the foul taste of rancid food in times of strive and struggle.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], clams in the cream sauce were served among numerous other dishes at the resplendent mansion of a [[dragonborn]] [[wizard]] [[Torlinn Shrake]], secretly a ''[[polymorph]]ed'' [[beholder]] who usurped the mage's persona."
