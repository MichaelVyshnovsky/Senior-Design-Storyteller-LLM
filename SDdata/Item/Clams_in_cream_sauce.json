        "mainbody": "Clams or oysters in cream sauce was an elven seafood dish found in the Northwest Faer√ªn.\nThis dish was made using oysters or clams that were steamed in beer. The cream sauce itself was a white condiment of dill, leeks, and chives. Traditional elven dishes were not made with onions or garlic as the Fair Folk consider their flavor to be overpowering and usually just reserved as \"wayfaring staples\" to mask the foul taste of rancid food in times of strive and struggle.\nIn the late 15 century DR, clams in the cream sauce were served among numerous other dishes at the resplendent mansion of a dragonborn wizard Torlinn Shrake, secretly a polymorphed beholder who usurped the mages persona."
