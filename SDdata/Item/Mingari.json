        "mainbody": "'''Mingari''' was a rare and exotic [[spice]] exported from [[Ulgarth]] around [[1367 DR]].",
        "Description & Uses": "This strong spice was similar to [[cinnamon]] in flavor. When blended with fruit from [[Maztica]], delicious [[ketjap]] was created. It needed to be blended, and was typically stored and sold in jars.",
        "Sources": "Mingari was farmed in eastern Ulgarth, particularly around [[Kaspar]] and east of [[Kelazzan]]. It was traded through [[Orvyltar]] to [[Durpar]], where the [[Karakil chaka]] in [[Morvar]] had a primary interest in the mingari trade. The Durpari shipped the mingari across the [[Shining South]].\n\nThroughout all of [[Toril]], mingari was only grown and blended in Ulgarth, who only traded it to Durpar, giving those countries a nice monopoly on the supply of the favored spice, which was just being discovered by wider [[Faer√ªn]] around [[1367 DR]]. It was Ulgarth's primary export."
