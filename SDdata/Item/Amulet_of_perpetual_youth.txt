An '''''amulet of perpetual youth''''' was an amulet that prevented the wearer from aging.

==Description==
The amulet had a faint blue glow, which grew dimmer as the amulet itself aged.

==Powers==
While worn, the ''amulet of perpetual youth'' protected the wearer from aging, both magical and natural. In effect, the amulet aged in place of the wearer, its glow fading until it went out completely, its magic spent, after which the wearer resumed aging normally. Any given ''amulet of perpetual youth'' could last for, and absorb, five years to three decades' worth of aging.

==Notable Examples==
The [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]] was granted a unique '''''brooch of perpetual youth'''''. While it only halved the wearer's natural and magical aging, it lasted as long as they held office.
