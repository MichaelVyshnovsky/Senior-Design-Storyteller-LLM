        "mainbody": "The wardstone was an object in Surgath Ilders possession.\nIt flashed when operating. Its actual operating mechanism was unknown, but Surgath Ilder had expected it to thwart curses.\nIts effects were inverted with a spell once. When inverted, its powers quickly slew the person they were protecting with a flame so intense it scorched some rubies.\nSurgath Ilder had purchased the item around  for two rubies. In , he was using it for protection against a curse he expected to be in place on some rubies he had just traded for, but Heldebran employed a spell to invert its functions, causing it to quickly incinerate Surgath Ilder with flames powerful enough to damage some of his rubies.\n* Surgath Ilder"
