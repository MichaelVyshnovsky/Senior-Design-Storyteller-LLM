        "Powers": "It flashed when operating. Its actual operating mechanism was unknown, but Surgath Ilder had expected it to thwart curses.\n\nIts effects were inverted with a spell once. When inverted, its powers quickly slew the person they were protecting with a flame so intense it scorched some [[rubies]].",
        "History": "Surgath Ilder had purchased the item around {{yearlink|239}} for two rubies. In {{yearlink|241}}, he was using it for protection against a curse he expected to be in place on some rubies he had just traded for, but [[Heldebran]] employed a spell to invert its functions, causing it to quickly incinerate Surgath Ilder with flames powerful enough to damage some of his rubies.",
