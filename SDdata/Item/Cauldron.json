        "mainbody": "'''Cauldrons''', '''boilers''', and '''kettles''' were common cooking vessels in the [[Realms]], similar to [[pot]]s.",
        "Description": "These vessels were used to boil water and cook foods over a fire such as [[soup]]s and [[stew]]s. Kettles were smaller and often used for family meals, while cauldrons were much larger and able to cook for large groups. They could be cast or forged from [[iron]], [[steel]], or [[copper]], and the most massive cauldrons could weigh as much as 40 tons. [[Spoon]]s and [[ladle]]s were vital for serving food from these vessels.\n\nCauldrons and kettles could also be used to pour substances such as boiling [[oil]] down castle walls onto invaders.",
        "Availability": "[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold cauldrons with tripods, available as {{SI|10|gal|l|long=yes}} for 10 [[gp]], {{SI|30|gal|l|long=yes}} for 22 gp, and {{SI|50|gal|l|long=yes}} for 32 gp.",
        "Notable Cauldrons": "Magical cauldrons tended to have functions related to preparing [[potion]]s, [[poison]]s, and extraordinary amounts of food.\n\n* [[The Boiler]], a massive cauldron used for siege warfare.\n* ''[[Cauldron of doom]]'', a [[necromantic]] artifact.\n* ''[[Everbountiful soup kettle]]'', a magical kettle that made soup.\n* ''[[Harvest cauldron]]'', a cooking pot worn as a helmet by [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]].",
        "Trivia": "* In the [[Roll of Years]], the year [[1379 DR]] bore the name \"Year of the Cauldron\".<ref><ref>"
