The Marlspire of Najara was a naga crown and major artifact given to the Najaran naga by the yuan-ti of the Hsstafi tribe in  as a symbol of loyalty. It was worn by Terpenzi and all successive kings through to the reign of Jarant. 
Far from being a mere symbol of office, the Marlspire had powerful magical capabilities (some of which only functioned when it was worn by a reptile.) If a non-reptile wore the Marlspire, that creature found itself more vulnerable to the attacks of reptiles.
The Marlspire of Najara had the normal abilities of a naga crown, including the power to dominate all Scaled Ones and see through invisibility.
In addition to these properties, it gave its bearer the ability to control Terpenzi, the Guardian of Najara.
