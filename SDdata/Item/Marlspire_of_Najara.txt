The '''''Marlspire of Najara''''' was a ''[[naga crown]]'' and [[major artifact]] given to the [[Najara]]n [[naga]] by the [[yuan-ti]] of the [[Hss'tafi]] tribe in {{YearlinkName|-320}} as a symbol of loyalty. It was worn by [[Terpenzi]] and all successive kings through to the reign of [[Jarant]]. 

==Abilities==
Far from being a mere symbol of office, the ''Marlspire'' had powerful magical capabilities (some of which only functioned when it was worn by a reptile.) If a non-reptile wore the ''Marlspire'', that creature found itself more vulnerable to the attacks of reptiles.

The ''Marlspire of Najara'' had the normal abilities of a ''naga crown'', including the power to [[Dominate monster|dominate]] all [[Scaled Ones]] and [[see invisibility|see through invisibility]].

In addition to these properties, it gave its bearer the ability to control Terpenzi, the Guardian of Najara.
