A '''''potion of poison''''' was an uncommon [[poison]] that mimicked beneficial [[potion]]s, such as ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]''.

==Description==
''Potions of poison'' were enchanted by [[illusion]] magic that made them indistinguishable from other potions. The illusion could be overcome by [[spell]]s such as ''[[identify]]''.

Drinking a ''potion of poison'' inflicted immediate poison damage to the imbiber and potentially poisoned them. The poison continued to act for several seconds after ingestion, until the drinker managed to resist the effects.
