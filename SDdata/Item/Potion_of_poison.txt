A potion of poison was an uncommon poison that mimicked beneficial potions, such as potions of healing.
Potions of poison were enchanted by illusion magic that made them indistinguishable from other potions. The illusion could be overcome by spells such as identify.
Drinking a potion of poison inflicted immediate poison damage to the imbiber and potentially poisoned them. The poison continued to act for several seconds after ingestion, until the drinker managed to resist the effects.
