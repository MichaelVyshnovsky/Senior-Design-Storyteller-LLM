        "mainbody": "A ring of delusion was a magic item capable of convincing its wearer that it was something else entirely.\nWhen worn, a ring of delusion convinced the wearer that it was another type of enchanted ring, usually whatever type they desired most. The wearer would use any means at their disposal to unconsciously create the believed magical effect of the ring. What anyone else witnessing the wearers use of the ring saw depended on the wearers ability to recreate the delusional magical effect. The ring could be removed at any time.\nMeilan, a spirit inhabiting the Palace of Ultimate Felicity in Kuo Meilan, owned a ring of delusion."
