        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of delusion''''' was a [[magic item]] capable of convincing its wearer that it was something else entirely.",
        "Powers": "When worn, a ''ring of delusion'' convinced the wearer that it was another type of enchanted ring, usually whatever type they desired most. The wearer would use any means at their disposal to unconsciously create the believed magical effect of the ring. What anyone else witnessing the wearer's use of the ring saw depended on the wearer's ability to recreate the delusional magical effect. The ring could be removed at any time.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Meilan]], a [[spirit]] inhabiting the [[Palace of Ultimate Felicity]] in [[Kuo Meilan]], owned a ''ring of delusion''."
