He planned on outfitting the entirety of Zhentarim army with these items but was assassinated by a Harper spy before he could roll the plan out. The deceased Generals plan of marching into the Dalelands was not embraced by his successor and neither were these numerous cloaks paid for. The wizards responsible for the items creation ended up selling them to recoup their hefty financial losses."
