        "mainbody": "potion of levitation was a potion that allowed its imbiber to levitate.\nThese potions allowed levitation of the imbiber only, up to a maximum weight of 6,000 gp equivalent. Thus, it was possible that the imbiber could carry another being or items, given that their combined weight was less than the cap.\nSuggested special ingredients for such potions were eyes of beholders or will-o-wisp essence. The lower tentacles of a haundar were a potent ingredient. The brain of a flumph could also be employed as an ingredient, when ground and liquefied. Each flumph brain yielded three potions.\nIn the 14 century DR, whenever the Wizards Guild of Ravens Bluff was coerced into surrendering magical potions or gravely suspected that an adventurer requesting them would put them to misuse, they would instead gift faulty potions of levitation or potions of delusion.\n* Nasr-uddin"
