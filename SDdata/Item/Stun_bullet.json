        "mainbody": "'''''Stun bullets''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[sling]] ammunition that disoriented and stupefied its targets.",
        "Powers": "''Stun bullets'' were imbued with magical currents that made them more balanced and gravitate towards the targets more easily. They also possessed a ''+1'' offensive enchantment that, upon reaching a living target, stunned them in a burst of magical energy, rendering them vulnerable for a short period of time.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''stun bullets'' were used by [[Aurilite]] [[Stormsister]]s and postulants who joined the [[Legion of the Chimera]] to bring destruction on the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] of [[Icewind Dale]]."
