A '''''wand of salt''''' was a rare [[enchanted]] [[wand]] that wracked a victim with intense cramps. Only two of these wands were known to exist.

==Description==
These items were made from a strange substance called [[saltsteel]]. The surface of the wand was overlaid with sand and sparkled.

==Powers==
The beam issued from a ''wand of salt'' assaulted victims with intense cramps and thirst that caused severe pain until they could drink a large amount of water. The wand could also be used to make a plot of land measuring {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} wide and long infertile.

==History==
These items were used by wicked followers of [[Tiamat]].
