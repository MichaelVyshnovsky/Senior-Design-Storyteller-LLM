A wand of salt was a rare enchanted wand that wracked a victim with intense cramps. Only two of these wands were known to exist.
These items were made from a strange substance called saltsteel. The surface of the wand was overlaid with sand and sparkled.
The beam issued from a wand of salt assaulted victims with intense cramps and thirst that caused severe pain until they could drink a large amount of water. The wand could also be used to make a plot of land measuring  wide and long infertile.
These items were used by wicked followers of Tiamat.
