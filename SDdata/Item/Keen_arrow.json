        "Powers": "The enchantment of ''keen arrows'' took place during the forging and assembly of the missiles. One could visually differentiate them from mundane arrows by ''keen arrows'' being slightly straighter. When shot from a [[bow]], ''keen arrows'' leapt from the weapon as if alive, effortlessly darting towards the target. They were known for their deadly accuracy and dramatically increased the chance of inflicting critical wounds upon impact.",
        "History": "''Keen arrows'' were widely used by the [[goblin]]s of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that besieged [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}."
