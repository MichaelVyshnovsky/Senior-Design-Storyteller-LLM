            "Uses": "[[File:QuillPen.png|thumb|273px|A quill pen.]]\nPens were used to transfer ink to [[paper]], usually by scholars to scribe [[book]]s and diplomats to write and sign contracts. Special forgery pens were produced for those who wanted to alter documents with precision. Simple pens were included in [[map-making kit]]s.\n\nPens were symbols of authority in [[Kara-Tur]] and represented two of the nine [[Gifts of the Faith]]. [[Gold]]en pens represented writing and [[jade]] pens represented history. Pen schools that taught art were even known the exist in the eastern continent, particularly the one founded by [[Shen Shou]].\n\nQuill pens were used as [[material component]]s for several [[spell]]s, both [[divine]] and [[arcane]]. However, if one wanted to scribe a [[magic]]al scroll, special types of pens would be needed, such as quills made from magical beasts.",
            "Types": "There were several types of ink pen, from simple [[goose]] feather quills to special metal-nibbed pens. They ranged in price depending on the quality of the pen. Standard ink pens cost just 2 [[cp]] each, but deluxe metal nibs imported from [[Kara-Tur]] sold for 70 [[gp]] a set. More modern pens were designed to hold reservoirs of ink, so that they did not need to be continuously dipped in ink, unlike quills.",
            "Alternatives": "Spells could be use to replicate the effect of a pen and ink. The ''[[amanuensis]]'' spell created an animated pen to duplicate magical writing. The magical pen could write just as quick as the caster, and the caster did not even have to be present."

        "Powers": "[[Magic]]al pens were known to exist throughout the [[multiverse]]. One such item was a quill pen that hovered above paper and wrote by itself. It also had the capabilities of speaking [[Common]].",
