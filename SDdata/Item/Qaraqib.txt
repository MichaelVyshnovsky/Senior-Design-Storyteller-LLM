The qaraqib () was a set of clackers used by Zakharan dancers.
A dancer would hold two sets of qaraqib in each hand and manipulate them while moving about.
It was rumored that some holy slayers were able to use the qaraqib to secretly communicate with members of their fellowship.
The qaraqib was banned within the Pantheist League.
