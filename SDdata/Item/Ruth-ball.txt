'''Ruth-balls''' were a type of deep-fried handfoods made out of seasoned ground [[chickpea]]s. The uncooked and unshaped mixture was referred to simply as ruth ({{Pronounce|rust|}}).

==Availability==
Ruth-balls were common across the Realms. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] savored the best ruth-balls on the island of [[Tashalar]] and in the city of [[Sammaresh]] of [[Lapaliiya]]. Ruth-balls served in [[Waterdeep]], [[Westgate]], and [[Selgaunt]] were also of surprising quality. Apparently, this opinion was somewhat controversial.
