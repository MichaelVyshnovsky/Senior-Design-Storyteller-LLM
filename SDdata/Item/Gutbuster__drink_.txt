Gutbuster was a strong dwarven brew consumed by the dwarves of northwest Faer√ªn.
Gutbuster was a strong drink that only the toughest dwarves and foolhardiest non-dwarves would ever attempt to drink. However, if the drinker survived it, they were granted immunity to poison, sleep and cold for some time. It was described as the "most foul-tasting concoction ever brewed."
The Gutbuster Brigade, the battlerager brigade of Mithral Hall, was named for the gutbuster they would consume before going to battle.
When Reginald Roundshield was granted a valor wish in 1478 DR, he wished for a trip to Mithral Hall and a keg of gutbuster.
