        "mainbody": "Amulets of elemental torment were minor enchanted amulets from the Emerald Grove in the Western Heartlands.\nThe item was a delicate chain with numerous gemstones, each gleamed with energy of elemental magic.\nThe amulets enchantment allowed for a spellcaster to fling spells while dealing additional damage channeled from an element they physically were in contact with at the time of the casting. Such elemental magics could be harnessed through fires, acid, water, among others.\n* Arron, a halfling druid merchant from the Emerald Grove in the late 15 century DR."
