The sitting bull was a magical chalice carved in the shape of a bull. It was one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, a collection of magical vessels created by the Han people of Koryo in ancient times.
One who drank from the cup was instilled with the powerful wu jen spell surelife, saving them against natural causes of death, and a protection against all assaults short of physical attack. However this benefit lasted for only one hour, and the cup itself could only be used once a day.
As one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, the sitting bulls powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost.
In the midâ€“14th century DR, King Wanang Sun led an expedition to recover three of the Wo-ha Ui-jung. He was successful, discovering the sitting bull, sitting monkey, and standing deer by 1357 DR. He was widely believe to make regular use of the sitting bull.
