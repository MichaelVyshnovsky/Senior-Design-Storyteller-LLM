'''Stagswift tonic''' was a type of alcoholic beverage found in the [[Western Heartlands]], along the [[River Chionthar]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Stagswift tonic was a creation of several high [[Lathanderian]] monasteries. The drink possessed properties that kept the monks awake for the first rays of dawn light and, usually, staying awake from the previous evening. These concoctions were sold in small {{SI|0.4|lb|k|long=yes}} bottles [[cork]]ed and decorated with the sun symbol of [[Lathander]].
