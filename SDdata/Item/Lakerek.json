        "mainbody": "A lakerek was a type of sled used on the Great Glacier.\nThe lakerek, known as the swiftest caribou sled, beared a resemblance to a kayak equipped with reins. Its design featured a dried skin stretched over a sturdy wooden frame. To embark on this sled, a single passenger positioned themselves within the opening atop the sled. Balancing themselves, they grasped a long pole called a pilakerek, ensuring stability throughout the ride."
