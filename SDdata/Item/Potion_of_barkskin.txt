Potion of barkskin was a common magical potion that turned the imbibers skin into thick but flexible tree bark that increased their armor.
Potions of barkskin was of a dark color and smelled musty, like a wet forest after a pouring rain. When swirled inside its vial, it turned into tough bark like twig and back into liquid.
Consuming a bottle of a potion of barkskin was similar in effect to the spell of the same name - barkskin, cast at a highly proficient level.
Salts of tree bark were extracted from wood woad bark. These salts were combined with a special type of alchemical suspension to brew elixirs of barkskin.
