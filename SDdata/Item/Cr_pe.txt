In the , a noble scion of House Wyvernspur, Giogioni Wyvernspur, and his then-new acquaintance Cat, were served a meal of cheese fondue, venison broth with noodles, fish poached in wine, and crêpes with boysenberry jam. Giogi was unimpressed with the meal but his guest, unaccustomed to such feasts, was delighted by each of the courses served by Thomas, young Wyvernspurs manservant.
