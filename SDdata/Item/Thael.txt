'''''Thael''''' was an enchanted [[broadsword]] that was once carried by the [[elf]] hero [[Afamrail]].

==Description==
''Thael''s' blade was forged from a black and greenish metal.

==Powers==
It was a ''+3 [[broadsword]]'', which rose to ''+5'' versus [[orcs]], [[goblins]], and [[gnolls]].

''Thael'' could emit a ''[[prismatic spray]]'' up to three times per day.

''Thael's'' powers only functioned when within a mile of its twin blade ''[[Amasal]]''.

==History==
The sword was carried into battle by Afamrail and his brother against a horde of gnolls. The brothers perished during the battle, but ''Thael'' was later recovered and brought to [[Taltempla]].
