Thael was an enchanted broadsword that was once carried by the elf hero Afamrail.
Thaels blade was forged from a black and greenish metal.
It was a +3 broadsword, which rose to +5 versus orcs, goblins, and gnolls.
Thael could emit a prismatic spray up to three times per day.
Thaels powers only functioned when within a mile of its twin blade Amasal.
The sword was carried into battle by Afamrail and his brother against a horde of gnolls. The brothers perished during the battle, but Thael was later recovered and brought to Taltempla.
