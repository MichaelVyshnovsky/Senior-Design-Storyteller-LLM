The '''''Urn of the Blue Vishap''''' was a unique [[Zakhara]]n [[magical item]] commanding a powerful creature.

==Description==
This item was aptly named, being an urn richly adorned in gold and blue with themes from the sea with a [[vishap]]'s head decorating its lid. It could change in height from one to four feet.

==Powers==
The ''Urn'' held the [[blue dragon]] [[Saluuknir]] in bounds. The holder of the urn could ask the mighty dragon to perform three tasks. Saluuknir was not only forced to fulfil these wishes, but also prevented from attacking the possessor of the urn or anyone else, except in defense of himself or his prison. The ''Urn of the Blue Vishap'' also granted its prisoner some magic abilities beyond its great natural powers.

==History==
The ''Urn'' was originally created as a ''[[genie prison]]'' by accomplished [[sha'ir]] [[Shalik ibn Shakuffar]], who used it to trap the evil [[marid]] Merifa of the Pearl Lagoons. The item was then sent outside of Zakhara, where Merifa managed to escape its power by tricking Saluuknir into exchanging places. The blue dragon had been seeking for ways to escape the urn and take revenge on the marid ever since. Four centuries after it left the Land of Fate, the ''Urn of the Blue Vishap'' was acquired by a [[corsair]] and brought back to Zakhara. Rumour had it, that in [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} it was in the possession of the [[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali|master]] of [[Jabal Sarahin |Assassin Mountain]].
