'''''Orckiller''''' was an enchanted jeweled [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[dagger]] from the ruined city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Powers==
The dagger's blade was enchanted to be especially deadly to [[orc]]s and [[orog]]s, doubling all damage done to these creatures.

==History==
''Orckiller'' was locked away in a chest along one of the smaller subterranean structures on the [[Avenue of Smiths]] of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] sometime before the complex was sealed by the fleeing survivors of the [[Weeping War]]. The dagger was still hidden on the Avenue of Smiths as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
