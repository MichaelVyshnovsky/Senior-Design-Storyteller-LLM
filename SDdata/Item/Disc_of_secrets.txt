A '''''disc of secrets''''' was an un[[holy symbol]] of [[Shar]] that bore an illusion to conceal its appearance, allowing a Sharran [[cleric]] to hide their true allegiance.

==Description==
The ''disc of secrets'' normally appeared to be a blank [[silver]] disc on an ordinary silver chain. Beneath this illusion was an unholy symbol of [[Shar]], a black disc of [[jet]] within a ring of purple [[amethyst]]s.

==Powers==
A shadow [[illusion]] was laid on the ''disc of secrets''; this was partially real and could not be disbelieved. The command phrase, "Reveal your secret to no one", ironically revealed its true appearance.

In all respects, a ''disc of secrets'' served as an unholy symbol of Shar in the hands of one of her clerics. The magic's only purpose was to conceal this fact.

Uniquely, a ''disc of secrets'' belonging to [[Shan Thar]], a cleric of [[Cyric]], bore a second illusion. Speaking the command word "lies" after the first command phrase caused the jawless white skull to appear within the black disc.

==Creation==
Fashioning a ''disc of secrets'' required knowledge of the ''[[shadow conjuration]]'' spell and a mastery of [[Shadow Weave]] [[magic]].

==History==
''Discs of secrets'' were employed by the clerics of Shar and [[Cyric]] behind the false [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] and those involved in operations in the [[Vast Swamp]], in the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].
