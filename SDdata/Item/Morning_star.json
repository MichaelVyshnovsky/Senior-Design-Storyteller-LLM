        "mainbody": "Morning stars (also \"morningstar\") were a simple type of one-handed melee weapon.\nMorningstars were very similar to a spiked club, but with refinements. Their shafts were usually made of wood and longer than a heavy mace. Their heads were typically round and covered in metal set. Around twenty spikes were set into this metal, radiating like a star, with the biggest spike extending straight from the top.\nMorningstars first became available in the Netheril Empire in .\n*Cracker and Whacker, the chief weapons of Athrogate\n* The gods Hruggek and Memnor were known to consider morningstars their favored weapon.\n* Bugbears often specialized in fighting with morningstars.\n* Firenewt warlocks often favored the use of morningstars in combat.\nA number of locations in the Realms were named after morningstars. These included the temple Morningstar Haven in Westgate, the village of Morningstar Hollows, and the road Morningstar Way in Waterdeep.\nSome people in the Realms bore \"Morningstar\" as a surname, such as Shay Morningstar and Thurd Morningstar.\nIn the Roll of Years, the year 1350 DR bore the name \"Year of the Morningstar\"."
