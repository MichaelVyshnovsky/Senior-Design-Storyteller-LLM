A '''''gem of seeing''''' was a magical [[gem]].

==Description==
The gem looked like a regular gem. The gem was exquisitely cut and polished. Casting ''[[detect magic]]'' on the gem was the only way to determine if it was a genuine ''gem of seeing''. Often the gem was mounted in a frame and attached to a pole for ease of use.

==Powers==
The gem gave the user the ability of [[True seeing|truesight]]. When an individual looked at an area through the gem, the gem detected all [[illusion]]s and invisible creatures or items. It was also able to detect astral, ethereal, and phased creatures. Earlier versions of the gem had a maximum viewing distance of {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}}, at which range only large or obvious objects or creatures were detectable, and could resolve small effects out to a range of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. Later versions of the gem had a fixed maximum range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}.
