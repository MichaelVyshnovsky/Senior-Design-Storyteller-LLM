        "mainbody": "Rickshaws, known as trotting carts in Waterdeep, were a type of carriage used to transport people in urban areas.\nRickshaws had two wheels and were capable of carrying up to two people comfortably. Rather than any animal, rickshaws were pulled by one or two people.\nIn the Xiousing district of Marsember, a man named Shiau Chen operated a rickshaw business out of the Lily Pad Inn.\nThe Waterdhavian guild known as the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen operated rickshaws throughout the city of Waterdeep. They charged people a single copper piece\n* On the Rock of Bral, rickshaws were one of the ways that people got around the city. The operators of these rickshaws charged passengers a silver piece.\n* Rickshaws could be seen in use in some parts of Shou Lung."
