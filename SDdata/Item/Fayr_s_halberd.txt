Fayrs halberd was the enchanted halberd that belonged to Bedwyn Fayr of the Company of the Black Snake in the early 13 century DR.
Fayrs halberd possessed a +3 enchantment.
Fayrs halberd made a name for itself being wielded by Bedwyn Fayr. His adventuring company employed clever tactics of sending dwarf and halfling members into close combat while taller adventurers used halberds and bows from a distance. The group was active through the early parts of the 13 century DR until the group was almost killed in 1252 DR. The companys two survivors, Fayr and Pep Greenfields retired their adventuring mantles and opened an antique shop in Waterdeep.
Thirty years later, by 1281 DR, Fayrs halberd found its way into the stock of Conlans Smithy in Kuldahar in Icewind Dale.
