        "Description": "These [[ornamental stones]] were found in deep green to blue-green hues and cleaved easily so it took a skilled [[wikipedia:lapidarist|lapidarist]] to handle properly. Typically they are tumbled or cut cabochon. Polished microcline had a shimmer due to tiny cleavage cracks that reflected light. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "Microcline could be used to make a substitute for [[squid]] and [[octopus]] [[ink]] that was the basis for many magical inks by grinding a microcline stone to powder and mixing it with the sap of a deciduous tree."
