The '''''spinesheath''''' was a unique [[enchanted]]'' ''[[stiletto]].

==Description==
The blade of this stiletto was specially designed to pierce through armor.

==Powers==
The ''spinesheath'' possessed a ''+1 enchantment''.

==History==
This stiletto first belonged to an assassin in [[Calimport]] by the name of Beledor, until one day he was [[poison]]ed by a bribed servant. The weapon's name was derived from his tendency to plunge its blade it into the backs of his targets.

Over time ''spinesheath'' changed hands, until ending up in the possession of a [[lizard king]] lairing in the [[Dragon's Eye]] in [[1281 DR]].
