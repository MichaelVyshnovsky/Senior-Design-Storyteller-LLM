'''Star pots''', also called '''fire pots''', were ceramic incendiary devices found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Uses==
These [[ceramic]] [[jar]]s were filled with [[liquid star]] and fitted with a thick wax [[wick]]. The jars were constructed to be strong enough to avoid accidents or light impacts and were typically used with [[siege engine]]s, though they could be thrown by hand to great effect assuming the wielder was strong enough to ensure they shattered upon impact.

When shattered a star pot would douse any nearby objects with flaming liquid star oil. The liquid star burned for several minutes following the impact.

==History==
Given the inherent risk in their use, star pots were usually reserved for highly trained soldiers. Star pots were illegal in the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]], though they could still be obtained on the black market for 55–100 [[gold piece]]s each.
