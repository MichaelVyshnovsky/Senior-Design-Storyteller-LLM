'''''Aberration hunters' amulet''''' were uncommon [[enchanted]] [[amulet]]s worn by [[githyanki]] hunters.

==Powers==
These magic items were of alien design for the [[Prime Material plane]]. They appeared to have a distinct githyanki look – made of shifting and swirling [[silver]] with strange stones affixed in the amulets' frames. The amulets reverberated with githyanki magic that protected them or gave them an advantage in dealing with psionic intelligence and mind-affecting magic. The wearers of these amulets also became hard to strike or attack from a distance by all aberrant beings. The wearer could also tap into the ancient githyanki knowledge stored within the amulets. It gave them knowledge of aberrant behavior and combat, giving them a combat advantage whilst attacking.

==History==
One ''aberration hunters' amulet'' belonged to the githyanki named [[Ghustil Stornugoss]] who settled in [[Crèche Y'llek]] on [[Toril]], in the [[Western Heartlands]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
