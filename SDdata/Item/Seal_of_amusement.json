        "mainbody": "The '''''seal of amusement''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[coin]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Jarlaxle]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "The coin could spin eternally, although it was unclear if Silverhand originally gave it any additional properties. Jarlaxe, finding the trinket amusing, sharpened the coin's edges to a razor's edge, and would use it to prank gambling partners and pickpockets. Injuries from the cruelly whimsical weapon left lasting injuries.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Jarlaxle, the [[drow]] leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] and of [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[rapier of derobement]]''."
