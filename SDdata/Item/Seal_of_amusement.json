        "mainbody": "he seal of amusement was a unique enchanted coin crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Jarlaxle in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nThe coin could spin eternally, although it was unclear if Silverhand originally gave it any additional properties. Jarlaxe, finding the trinket amusing, sharpened the coins edges to a razors edge, and would use it to prank gambling partners and pickpockets. Injuries from the cruelly whimsical weapon left lasting injuries.\n* Jarlaxle, the drow leader of Bregan Daerthe and of Luskan in the late 15 century DR, to whom Silverhand also gifted the rapier of derobement."
