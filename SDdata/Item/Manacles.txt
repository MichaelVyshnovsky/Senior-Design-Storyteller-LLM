Manacles, or shackles, were metal restraints used to bind creatures and reduce their movement.
Typical manacles could bind creatures ranging from human-sized to halfling-sized. Larger manacles existed but cost considerably more. They could be opened effortlessly with an appropriate key or, with some effort, through the use of thieves tools to bypass the lock. They could also be broken by a sufficiently strong individual. The difficulty in escaping or breaking free of manacles depended mostly on the quality of their construction.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold elaborate shackles that included rings for the neck, arms, and legs. These shackles could also be mounted on walls and cost 10 gold pieces to order.
