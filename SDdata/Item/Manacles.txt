'''Manacles''', or '''shackles''', were metal restraints used to bind creatures and reduce their movement.

==Description==
Typical manacles could bind creatures ranging from [[human]]-sized to [[halfling]]-sized. Larger manacles existed but cost considerably more. They could be opened effortlessly with an appropriate key or, with some effort, through the use of [[thieves' tools]] to bypass the lock. They could also be broken by a sufficiently strong individual. The difficulty in escaping or breaking free of manacles depended mostly on the quality of their construction.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold elaborate shackles that included rings for the neck, arms, and legs. These shackles could also be mounted on walls and cost 10 [[gold piece]]s to order.
