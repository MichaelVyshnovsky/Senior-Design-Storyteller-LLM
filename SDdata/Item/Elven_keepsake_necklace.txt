==History==
Decades before [[1372 DR]], Elveronne Bricket was deeply in love with a beautiful wood elf lass. They relationship was cut short by the woman's father who forbade the romance. Elveronne was gifted the ''elven keepsake necklace'', a bitter sweet reminder of young love lost. The young noble moved to never part with the magic necklace. Throughout his life, Elveronne was haunted of his lover's visage, he never stopped thinking of his [[jade]]-eyed beloved.

In 1372 DR, at the dusk of his human years, Elveronne Bricket was murdered by his sisters who resented the man for his frugality. During the funeral, [[Alicine Bricket]], one of the sisters, stole the enchanted locket from her brother's body with a sleight of hand. Unbeknownst to the sisters, Elveronne's vow was so strong, it raised him from the grave as a restless dead, burning with hatred for the thief and the murderer - his dear sisters.
