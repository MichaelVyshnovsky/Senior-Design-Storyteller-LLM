        "mainbody": "'''Nails''' were a simple and vital kind of fastener that were used in many types of carpentry and construction in the [[Realms]]. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[spike]]s, [[rivet]]s, and [[peg]]s.",
        "Description": "[[File:Iron Nails.png|thumb|''Some nails.'']]\nNails were typically between {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} and {{SIAdj|4|inch|c|long=yes}} long (any longer and they were considered spikes), and were most often made from [[iron]]. Depending on their method of manufacture, they could be made with a round or square cross-section.\n\nA common variation was the '''eye spike''', an extra-long nail that would be driven into a tree or wooden wall which could then be bent into a simple ring, such as for securing [[rope]]s.\n\nAside from bolts, spikes, and pegs, nails also had a strong resemblance to [[needle]]s and [[stake]]s.",
        "Availability": "[[File:Iron Nails 2.png|thumb|''A few more nails.'']]\nAlongside other forms of common ironmongery, nails were widely produced by artisans in [[Faer√ªn]] to keep up with constant demand. They were often made by apprentice blacksmiths who worked on other simple, useful items such as spikes and [[hook]]s.\n\n''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of nails and related tools in various configurations and sizes, including {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} finishing nails (2 [[sp]]/lb) and {{SIAdj|2|inch|c|long=yes}} or {{SIAdj|3|inch|c|long=yes}} joiners' nails (1 sp/lb).",
        "Usage": {
            "Magic": "* ''[[Hold monster]]'' used a metal rod as a [[material component]], such as a nail or spike.\n* The ''[[statue]]'' spell could be cast using a mixture of [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[sand]], and water stirred by an iron nail or spike."
