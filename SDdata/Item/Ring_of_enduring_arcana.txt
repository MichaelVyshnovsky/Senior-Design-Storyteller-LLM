A ring of enduring arcana was a fine latticework of gold and mithral that covers most of the length of the wearers finger, with a joint in the middle to allow movement. It appeared to shift and flow whenever the wearer cast a spell.
A ring of enduring arcana was permanently active for as long as it was worn.  However, it did require 24 hours to acclimate to the wearer, starting when it was donned.
