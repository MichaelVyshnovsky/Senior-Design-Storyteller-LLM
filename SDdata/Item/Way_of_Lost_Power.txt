The '''Way of Lost Power''' was a small twenty-two page hand written [[chapbook]] which contained cryptic hints to guide the reader to sites containing lost [[magic]].  

==Description==
The original book was a rather ordinary looking, slim chapbook with the title on the cover.

==History==
The book was copied as many as seventy times although the content in some of the copies may have been altered as most of the copies had fewer than the original twenty-two pages. Many [[mage]]s suspected the copies contained erroneous information intended to lead the reader astray.  The original author was unknown although the book was attributed variously to [[Velahoondar]], "[[Elminster|Old Elminster]]", [[Volo]] and [[Khelben the Younger]].
