The Way of Lost Power was a small twenty-two page hand written chapbook which contained cryptic hints to guide the reader to sites containing lost magic.  
The original book was a rather ordinary looking, slim chapbook with the title on the cover.
The book was copied as many as seventy times although the content in some of the copies may have been altered as most of the copies had fewer than the original twenty-two pages. Many mages suspected the copies contained erroneous information intended to lead the reader astray.  The original author was unknown although the book was attributed variously to Velahoondar, "Old Elminster", Volo and Khelben the Younger.
