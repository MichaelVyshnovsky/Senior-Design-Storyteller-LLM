        "Powers": "This staff's ends were constantly ablaze with flames, seemingly fueled by air and leaving no scorch damage on the weapon itself. In addition to the fire damage the weapon dealt, it possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided it toward the target and boosted its damage even further.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such staff belonged to [[Roah Moonglow]], a hin agent of the [[Zhentarim]] who did business with the recently emerged [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]]."
