}}'''Topaz''' was a [[precious stones|precious stone]] that occurred in [[granite]] deposits, sometimes yielding large, gem-quality crystals.

==Description==
Topaz was a very hard, clear gemstone that was usually golden yellow but could be found in shades from yellow to orange and brown. Topaz turned pink or light blue if subjected to high temperatures.

Topaz stones were considered sacred by followers of [[Deneir]], [[Horus-Re]], and [[Gaerdal Ironhand]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found. The blue variety of topaz was sacred to followers of [[Eldath]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11-12}}

The bigger-sized gems were a customary gifts on state occasions. For such events, topazes were worked by only the most skilled master gemcutters.

==Powers==
Topaz was often used to create items that conferred protection from magical effects because topaz took on the hardness of [[mithral]] when so enchanted.

Topaz gems naturally stored healing magic. By casting a healing spell on this gemstone, the topaz could be placed into an open wound where it would release its stored magic and dissipate completely, or it could be powdered and mixed with milk or wine in a mithral vessel (any other substance leeched the magic out of the mixture before it could be consumed). A topaz healing draught tasted cold and sour.

Topaz was sometimes called the ''jewel of light'' because it could extend the duration of ''[[faerie fire]]'' spells cast upon it for a few days to nearly a month.

This versatile gem was also used in the explosive [[druid]] spell ''[[Sol's searing orb]]''.
