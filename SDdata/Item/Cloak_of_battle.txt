A '''''cloak of battle''''' was a [[Item enchantment|magically enchanted]] cloak that could entangle any weapon that attempted to strike its wearer. It could prevent an assailant from being able to use their weapon, and keep it if they tried to leave.

They also possessed a [[command word]] that, if spoken when held, would transform the cloak into a [[magic]]al cudgel.
