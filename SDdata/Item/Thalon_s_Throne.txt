'''''Thalon's Throne''''' was a magical trap devised by the [[lich]] [[Thalon]], and the subject of a popular rhyme.

==Description==
The throne resembled a seat carved from a single block of stone.

==Powers==
Anyone seated in the throne would have their consciousness immediately subsumed by [[Thalon]]'s and their body so taken over.

==Reputation==
[[Thalon]] and his throne were the subject of a famous rhyme, said to predate [[Myth Drannor]].

{{quote|Sit not alone<br />On Thalon's cold throne<br />Unless alone ye would be<br />Unmatched master of wizardry.<br />Sit ye there overnight<br />And of Art gain great sight<br />Wise beyond that of any mage<br />In the Realms, of this age.|Old rhyme}}

==History==
In {{yearlink|1357}}, [[Laeral Rythkyn]] discovered what was to her knowledge the oldest extant copy of the rhyme. Written in [[Thorass]], it was encrypted with a spell. She found it in an old spellbook which she had unearthed in some cellars in [[Everlund]] while helping the [[Harpers]] eliminate [[wraith]]s there. By mid-[[Kythorn]] of that year, she deciphered the encrypted message, discovering that the location of ''Thalon's Throne'' was in a tower hidden near [[Alander]], the [[Lost Peaks]].

She explored the tower and braved its many perils, only to discover her apprentice [[Blaskyn]] followed her to lay an ambush at the end. He then sat on the throne, and was soon subsumed by Thalon's consciousness. She prevailed over Thalon afterwards, and resolved to decomission his throne sooner than later.
