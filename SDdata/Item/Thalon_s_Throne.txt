Thalons Throne was a magical trap devised by the lich Thalon, and the subject of a popular rhyme.
The throne resembled a seat carved from a single block of stone.
Anyone seated in the throne would have their consciousness immediately subsumed by Thalons and their body so taken over.
Thalon and his throne were the subject of a famous rhyme, said to predate Myth Drannor.
In , Laeral Rythkyn discovered what was to her knowledge the oldest extant copy of the rhyme. Written in Thorass, it was encrypted with a spell. She found it in an old spellbook which she had unearthed in some cellars in Everlund while helping the Harpers eliminate wraiths there. By mid-Kythorn of that year, she deciphered the encrypted message, discovering that the location of Thalons Throne was in a tower hidden near Alander, the Lost Peaks.
She explored the tower and braved its many perils, only to discover her apprentice Blaskyn followed her to lay an ambush at the end. He then sat on the throne, and was soon subsumed by Thalons consciousness. She prevailed over Thalon afterwards, and resolved to decomission his throne sooner than later.
