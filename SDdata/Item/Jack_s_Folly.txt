Jacks Folly was a pair of old and weathered leather boots that once belonged to a would-be treasure seeker named Jack Corvet.
The boots humble appearance hid their magic well. Once per day upon command, Jacks Folly unleashed the enlarge person spell.
Sometime before the , Jack Corvet attempted a daring robbery of a cloud giant. He claimed the giants golden chicken, but his stealth failed the adventurer, and the giant quickly gained on Jack. The adventurer whispered a wish upon a lucky ring inherited from his grandmother. To everyones surprise, Jack grew in size, big enough to be able to punch the giant out and flee with the precious poultry treasure. When the chicken laid a golden egg, Jack sold it and, with the money, replaced his old raggedy pair of boots.
Later, Jack Corvet attempted the robbery again, but the "magic" ring did nothing this time. Jack did not survive the burglary. Such was the story of Jacks Folly as true magic was hidden within his old boots. By 1374 DR, the boots found their way into the collection of Mintassan the Magnificent, proprietor of Mintassans Mysteries in Westgates Market Triangle.
