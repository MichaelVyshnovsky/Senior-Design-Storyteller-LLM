        "mainbody": "tarellas aphrodisiac was a type of magical, aromatic oil with a charming effect.\nWhen a dose of this oil was worn, any creature that was of a similar race and the opposite sex that came within  of the wearer became thoroughly enamored as if under the effect of a powerful charm. They may regard the wearer as an ally, a trusted friend, or a romantic interest who had to be protected and whose words or actions were viewed in the most favorable way. It was possible for a person to became so enamored that they became incredibly jealousy, seeing other people as rivals.\nDoses remained effective anywhere from ten minutes to two hours, eventually evaporating. The state they induced in people lasted so long as they remained within the vicinity of the wearer.\nOne possible ingredient for crafting Starellas aphrodisiac was the tears of a jilted lover.\n* The Dancing Maiden in Westgate, run by the mage Chalaratha, was said to create this oil upon request for a hefty commission.\n* Some shairs were known to craft these oils.\n* Fakhira\n* Jamal al-Yindannim"
