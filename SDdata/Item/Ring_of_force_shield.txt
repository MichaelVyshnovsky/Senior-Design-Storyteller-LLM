'''''Rings of force shield''''' were [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s that granted their wearers magical defensive [[shield]]s.

==Description==
These rings were simple bands of [[iron]].

==Powers==
''Rings of force shield'' granted their wearers the ability to conjure a large shield of an invisible force at will. When activated, these magical walls of force could be wielded like mundane shields without any of the downsides of hauling a heavy piece of metal around.

==History==
Originally, these rings were created by the eccentric [[Harpell]] [[wizard]]s of [[Longsaddle]]. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''rings of force shield'' could be found in many places along the [[Sword Coast]]. In [[1372 DR]], one of these items belonged to a group of [[Zhentarim]] agents who operated from under the secret subbasement of the [[Black Stone Inn]] in [[Daggerford]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Damian Krale]]: a worshiper of [[Shar]] who was trying to unite the many Sharan cells of the [[Western Heartlands]] '' circa'' [[1374 DR]].
*[[Viansola]]: The sister of [[Lorelei Alavara]], [[elf|elven]] [[warrior]] with a grudge against [[Cormyr]] who was trapped in [[Grodd]] ''circa'' [[1371 DR]].
