'''Great helm''' was a term used to refer to large [[helmet]]s that covered the entirety of the wearer's head and neck, as well as often their upper shoulders. They were typically found in combination with [[plate mail]] or heavier armors, but rarely anything lighter than [[banded mail]].

==Description==

A great helm typically impaired its wearer's sense of hearing and vision, and [[knight]]s often paired them with a [[mail coif]].

==History==
By the 1370's [[DR]], the great helm style of helm was commonly issued in nations across the [[Eastern Heartlands|Heartlands]] to various nobles, knights, cavalrymen and officers. These helmets typically had hinged visors, that opened either horizontally or vertically, and were paired with [[gorget]]s and plate mail.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/Regional Armor}}

In [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} a group of [[duergar]] outfitted in [[iron]] bucket helms with visors ventured from their home in the [[Terminus Level]] of [[Undermountain]] up into the [[Runestone Level]], determined to plunder a shrine dedicated to [[Laduguer]] and return their loot to their ruler [[Fazrian]].
