        "mainbody": "A partisan was a member of the spear family of polearms, being particularly similar to the spetum and ranseur in design,The partisan could possibly be considered a \"combination weapon,\" what with its small axeheads, but since its primary purpose is thrusting its considered a member of the spear family. to the point that it was not uncommon to confuse them.\nPartisans consisted of spear, with a long reach courtesy of a shaft that measured  in length. The heads of these spears were double-edged and large enough to support engraving and ornamentation. Directly below this spear head, two flukes or \"axe-like spikes\" protruded diagonally from the base.\nThis weapon was primarily used for thrusting at and piercing opponents, but the two flukes protruding from below the spearhead gave the weapon greater utility of cutting and slashing attacks. They also improved the partisans penetrating potential, offered a defensive potential to the user, and could be used to catch and break an opponents weapon.\nPlaces in the Realms where one could purchase partisans included\n* The Weaponers of Cormyr.\n* The Ravenian merchant Bendekar had multiple partisans in his homes expansive weapons collection."
