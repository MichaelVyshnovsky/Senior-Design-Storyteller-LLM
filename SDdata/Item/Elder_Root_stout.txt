'''Elder Root stout''' was a type of [[ale]] brewed in the [[Running Stag]] tavern in [[Berdusk]] and exported to other places along the [[Sword Coast]].

==Description==
Elder Root stout was a well-brewed rich and flavorful stout. Its good taste was partially due to the use of soft water from the Running Stag's spring.

==History==
Elder Root stout was popular in the 1360s DR in Berdusk and brought abundant clientele to the Running Stag, including forest folk, [[wild elves]], [[druid]]s, and other [[fey]] races. By [[1372 DR]], Elder Root stout was exported to other places on the Sword Coast, including [[Daggerford]], where the stout was a popular staple at the [[Black Stone Inn]].
