'''Rosto''' was a [[gnome|gnomish]] highsunfeat [[sandwich]] from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]].

==Description==
Rosto was a [[rye bread]] sandwich of sliced [[roast rothé]], drizzled with [[mushroom]] [[gravy]] or [[dill sauce]]. It often served with gnomish pale [[ale]]s, such as [[Rockgrit]], [[Stint]], or [[Greentart]].

==History==
Rosto was a staple of a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called [[Le PoTeete Café]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The only other highsunfeat alternative on the menu was [[Brick]], a type of stuffed and baked [[bread]].
