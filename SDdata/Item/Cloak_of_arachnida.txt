Cloaks of arachnida were enchanted cloaks that granted the wearer abilities of a spider.
Cloaks of arachnida were black mantles that emanated a strong aura of alteration magic.
The wearers of these cloaks were granted the continual effects of the spider climb spell, allowing them to scale any surface, rendering them completely immune to the web spell, and unrestrainable by any mundane webs. Additionally, the wearer was able to create a magical web, double the size of such a web conjured via spell. Lastly, the wearer became resistant to any arachnid venom or poison.
Spiderstone golems were imbued with magics that lingered on their bodies after the constructs were destroyed. As such, remnants of spiderstone golems could be used in crafting and enchanting of spider-related magic items, including cloaks of arachnida. A skilled crafter of magic items could recreate a cloak of arachnida using spider climb and web spells.
