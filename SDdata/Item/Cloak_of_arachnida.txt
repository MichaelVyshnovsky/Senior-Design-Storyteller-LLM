'''''Cloaks of arachnida''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that granted the wearer abilities of a [[spider]].

==Description==
''Cloaks of arachnida'' were black mantles that emanated a strong aura of ''[[alteration]]'' magic.

==Powers==
The wearers of these cloaks were granted the continual effects of the ''[[spider climb]]'' [[spell]], allowing them to scale any surface, rendering them completely immune to the ''[[web]]'' spell, and unrestrainable by any mundane webs. Additionally, the wearer was able to create a magical ''web'', double the size of such a web conjured via spell. Lastly, the wearer became resistant to any arachnid venom or [[poison]].

==Creation==
[[Spiderstone golem]]s were imbued with magics that lingered on their bodies after the [[construct]]s were destroyed. As such, remnants of spiderstone golems could be used in crafting and enchanting of spider-related magic items, including ''cloaks of arachnida''.{{Cite dragon/193/Live Statues and Stone Men|22}} A skilled crafter of magic items could recreate a ''cloak of arachnida'' using ''spider climb'' and ''web'' spells.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the so-called King of Spiders [[Sirachna]] gained entrance to a home on [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]] from a cavern underneath. His arachnid pets ended up murdering a family who lived inside, leaving them haunting the home as restless [[ghost]]s. Some said the King of Spiders was killed by an adventurer, accompanied by [[Charissa Maernos]], [[Mantides]], and [[Rinara]], who claimed his ''cloak of arachnida'' and several other magic items.
