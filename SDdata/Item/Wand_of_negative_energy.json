        "mainbody": "'''''Wands of negative energy''''' were offensive magic [[wand]]s imbued with arcane ''[[negative energy]]''.",
        "Description": "These wands were crafted out of [[elf|elven]] femurs. The bone shafts were smoothed and yellowed by many hands that held these wands since their creation. The gruesomeness of these magic items was accentuated by fetishes that dangled off these wands. The ''negative energy'' at the core of these wands made anyone touching them feel the unpleasant sensation of their flesh crawling.",
        "Powers": "Usable by [[bard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s, fully-charged ''wands of negative energy'' held fifty uses of the ''[[negative energy ray]]''.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these evil-looking wands could be found throughout the [[Sword Coast]] region, notably in the cities of [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]]."
