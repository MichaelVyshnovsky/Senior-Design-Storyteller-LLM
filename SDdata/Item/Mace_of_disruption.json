        "mainbody": "A mace of disruption was a weapon that could utterly obliterate undead by disrupting the reanimation magic\nA +1 mace, on impact, could destroy undead and lower-planes beings. Lesser undead such as skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, shadows, and wights were instantaneously blasted into non-existence. Greater undead could resist this effect, such as wraiths, mummies, spectres, vampires, ghosts, liches, in order of resilience, with evil lower-planes beings hardest to destroy, but even if they resisted, their injuries twice as severe as they would be normally.\nThe weapon bore a neutral good nature and powerful enchantments. Just touching it caused an evil being harm.In a Sage Advice column for Dragon #245, Skip Williams defines \"touching\" the mace as \"...try[ing] to pick up, handle, or examine the item...\" and that \"nothing happens if someone pokes the [evil] creature with the item or throws it at the creature.\"\nMaces of disruption could be created with varied power levels. Lesser maces of disruption had the ability to slay undead upon a successful hit and produced  bright yellow light. \nthumb|335x335px\nMaces of disruption were popular among clerics of Lathander for their undead-slaying powers. One such cleric was captured as he attempted to infiltrate Thay. Szass Tam himself flayed the cleric alive as cautionary example for others and reanimated the husk as a zombie servant.\nIn 1369 DR a mace of disruption could be found within the lair of a vampire Bodhi under Athkatlas cemetery. Same year dwarven smith in Athkatla, Cromwell, knew how to increase the weapons effectiveness by coating it with illithium, making it a +2 enchanted weapon.\nIn 1372 DR, maces of disruption of +2 enchantment was created by blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor for the Hero of Neverwinter. Later a variation with +5 enchantment was created by Barun Silverblade of Beorunnas Well.\n* Astral devas wielded mace-like weapons with the powers of maces of disruption.\n* Chiron Laventhos, a priest of Mystra that worked at The Bandaged Wound in Ravens Bluff owned a mace of disruption.\n* Ellesime wielded a mace of disruption when encountered by Abdel Adrian on his bhaalspawn pocket plane.\n* Halbenet Soladonel wielded a mace of disruption along with a similarly themed shield during the late 15 century DR."
