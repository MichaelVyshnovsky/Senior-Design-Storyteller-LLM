'''''Fukio's Silks''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[silk]] [[robe]] that once belonged to a legendary [[ninja]] [[Fukio]].

==Powers==
''Fukio's Silks'' possessed a powerful defensive ''+3'' enchantment. Other magics imbued into the silk robe were designed to visually and audibly disorient. The disorientation allowed the wearer of the silks to escape unscathed or land a lucky and deadly strike. The robes' audible disorientation came from its fabric ruffling, producing innocuous sounds that resembled a breeze. Additionally, the wearer could conjure the ''[[mirror image]]'' [[spell]] once per day.

==History==
''Fukio's Silks'' were worn by assassin ninja Fukio during the [[Omi War]] in [[Shou Lung]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the robes were imported out of [[Kara-Tur]] and sold at [[Okuzo's Imports]] in the city of [[Westgate]].
