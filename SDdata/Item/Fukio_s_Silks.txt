Fukios Silks was a unique enchanted silk robe that once belonged to a legendary ninja Fukio.
Fukios Silks possessed a powerful defensive +3 enchantment. Other magics imbued into the silk robe were designed to visually and audibly disorient. The disorientation allowed the wearer of the silks to escape unscathed or land a lucky and deadly strike. The robes audible disorientation came from its fabric ruffling, producing innocuous sounds that resembled a breeze. Additionally, the wearer could conjure the mirror image spell once per day.
Fukios Silks were worn by assassin ninja Fukio during the Omi War in Shou Lung. By the , the robes were imported out of Kara-Tur and sold at Okuzos Imports in the city of Westgate.
