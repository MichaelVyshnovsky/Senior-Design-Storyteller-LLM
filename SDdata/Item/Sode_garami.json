        "mainbody": "A sode garami () was a weapon unique to the continent of Kara-Tur. It was also known as the sleeve entangler.\nThe sode garami was a highly specialized weapon employed for the purpose of capturing and ensnaring an opponent without inflicting significant harm. Typically designed as a set comprising a pole  in length and crossbar adorned with numerous spikes and hooks. \nUpon a successful strike, it ensnared and latched onto the targets clothing. When the sode garami was used for capturing, it inflicted no direct damage. However, forceful strikes could also be executed with the weapon, resulting in both the described effect and the associated damage. This weapon found frequent usage among palace guards and city constables."
