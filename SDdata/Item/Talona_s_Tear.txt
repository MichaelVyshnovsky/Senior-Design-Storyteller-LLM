Talonas Tears were enchanted Talonite thrown weapons, symbolic of the Mistress of Disease and Mother of All Plagues.
These small chunks of amber could fit in ones hand. These stones emanated constant buzzing sounds from their cores.
When Talonas Tear was thrown, it shattered upon impact and from its core a deadly swarm of insects was unleashed to gnaw on everything in their way. This effect was similar to a powerful version of the creeping doom spell.
One of Talonas Tears was hidden deep inside a vault of the Temple of Bhaal in the town of Liams Hold, later known as the Stronghold. The wondrous Talonite item was deposited there sometime before the temples fall and abandonment during the Time of Troubles. As of 1372 DR, the Tear was still locked behind the vaults hidden door and guarded by three gargoyles.
