        "mainbody": "Red Tears, also known as Tempus weeping or Tempuss weeping, were gemstones found only in the Realms in deep mines or anywhere old stone had been exposed by erosion, mining, or rockfall.\nRed tears were teardrop-shaped crystals with a glossy surface, vividly colored fiery orange, cherry red, or blood crimson. Legends say they were the tears of lovers left behind after their sweethearts perished in battle, stained by the blood of the fallen.\nThese gem stones served as a substitute for all material components used in any healing spell that didnt require specific construction. Powdered red tear was an ingredient for making the magic ink for creating scrolls of spells that mended broken objects.\nRed tears were considered prized gems among the drow, albeit only those of darker hues.\nThe church of Tempus believed that their deity appeared during the Time of Troubles in both Battledale and the Fields of the Dead, but which occurred first has not been established. What is known is the Foehammer journeyed across four famous battlefields, using or creating a circular chain of one-way portals, and leaving a trail of red tears behind him to mark the path he took. If they were real gems, they have long since been collected or stolen. What remained behind were actually illusions of Tempuss weepings, only visible to those who successfully met the challenges at each stop along the trail.\nFRLarmes rouges\nCategoryGems\nCategory1000-1499 gold pieces\nCategoryGem stones\neazeytqvpw419ebb58rydrwil03gp2i"
