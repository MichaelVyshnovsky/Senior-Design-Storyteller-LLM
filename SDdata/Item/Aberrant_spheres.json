        "mainbody": "Aberrant spheres were magical devices that summoned aberrations to the user.\nThe surfaces of such spheres seemed to flash words in the speakers native tongue, just visible enough to remain unidentifiable.\nThe spheres renewed their three charges each day. By spending one charge, a choker was summoned by spending two charges, a grick was summoned instead and by spending three charges, the creature summoned was a carrion crawler. The summoned creature remained for slightly more than half a minute, commensurate with the power of the spheres themselves. For as long as the monster was still present, the owners mind became more vulnerable.\nOn summoning the monster, the sphere shattered, reforming after their departure or destruction no more than one monster could be summoned at a time.\nThese spheres were created by alienists and other cultists who worshiped aberrant entities.\n* Zceryll"
