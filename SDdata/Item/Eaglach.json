        "mainbody": "'''''Eaglach''''' was a traditional [[dwarf|dwarven]] stew with its name, if translated from [[Dwarvish]], likely scaring those unfamiliar with dwarven food.",
        "History": "Despite being a traditional dwarvish dish, ''eaglach'' occasionally had variations on the recipe. One such variant was printed in a popular cooking [[chapbook]] ''[[The Purged Palate]]'' in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The author's secret ingredient was [[drider venom]] added in after the alcohol was boiled away. The author warned the readers to avoid using the venom in the recipe, substituting it with a safer sour ingredient. The author discovered the ingredient by accident during his days as a city watchman. A [[drow]] [[thief]] poisoned a bowl of ''eaglach,'' resulting in a delicious new recipe."
