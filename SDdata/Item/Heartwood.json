        "mainbody": "Heartwood was a worked piece of magical wood found in the late 15 century DR. Due to its unique properties, it was able to be used similarly to a docent of Eberron.\nWhen installed in a warforged, heartwood spread green mossy growth across their body.\nThe living wood greatly enhanced the protective and regenerative properties of a warforgeds form while it was used.\nHeartwood was found in the treasure pile of the red dragon Daeronnax, the master of Clan Daeronnax in the Stonelands after he kidnapped the adventurer Tristran of Daggerford."
