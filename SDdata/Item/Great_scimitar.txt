Great scimitars  were larger two-handed versions of the common scimitar. These deadly swords were found primarily in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, where it was often referred to as the "headsmans sword" since it was used by executioners.
A great scimitar was a truly massive sword, weighing on average a pound more than the mighty greatsword. The weapons mass required two hands to wield properly unless the wielder possessed unnatural strength. The great scimitars huge blade was curved and designed to cut through enemies.
A great scimitar could be purchased for 40â€“90 dinars.
