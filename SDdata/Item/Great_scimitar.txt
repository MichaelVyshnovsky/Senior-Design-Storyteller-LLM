'''Great scimitars'''  were larger two-handed versions of the common [[scimitar]]. These deadly [[sword]]s were found primarily in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, where it was often referred to as the "headsman's sword" since it was used by executioners.

==Description==
A great scimitar was a truly massive sword, weighing on average a pound more than the mighty [[greatsword]]. The weapon's mass required two hands to wield properly unless the wielder possessed unnatural strength. The great scimitar's huge blade was curved and designed to cut through enemies.

A great scimitar could be purchased for 40–90 [[dinar]]s.

==History==
These weapons were favored by [[harim servant genie]]s who carried one in each massive hand.
