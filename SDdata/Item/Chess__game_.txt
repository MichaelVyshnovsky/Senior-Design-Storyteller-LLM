'''Chess''' was a board game and "one of the four universal games" of [[Faerûn]] along with [[draughts]], [[dice]], and [[Talis]]. A three-dimensional variant called [[Dragonchess|dragonchess]] also exists.

==Description==
In Faerûn, chess was played on a checkered board with thirty-two pieces of six types: pawns, rooks (or castles), knights-errant (or knights), priests (or bishops), queens, and kings. The board was the same as that used in the simpler game of [[draughts]]/checkers, and was called a chess board or lanceboard. They usually came with the board in a wooden case.

==Rules==
The knight piece was known for jumping directly between squares.

There were regional variations to the rules. In [[Calimshan]], a piece must be moved once it had been touched, but that rule was not used in [[Cormyr]]. In Cormyr, a player needed to announce their move out loud but this could be neglected. In Cormyr, the black king piece was sometimes termed "[[Gondegal]]" after the rebel would-be king of [[1352 DR]].

There were many named tactics, such as the Theskan double-counter gambit.

==Sets==
[[File:Standard King Piece.png|thumb|right|''A black king piece carved from ebony, from Aurora's Standard Set.'']]
While the more common and cheaper chess sets were made of carved and [[dye]]d wood or painted [[clay]], finer sets were often made of more exotic materials. These included [[ivory]] for the white pieces and [[ebony]] or [[onyx]] for the black pieces, and an oiled wooden or even [[marble]] board. Alternatively, [[luspeel]] (magnetite) could be used so the pieces would have a slight magnetic attraction to a [[steel]] chessboard.

Chess sets often used well-known figures, such as [[:Category:Rulers|rulers]] or [[:Category:Deities|deities]], for the king pieces. or were inspired by famous historical or recent battles and events.

Some noted traditional, specialty, and magical sets were as follows:

;Traditional Set: This was the most common and oldest form of the game. Typical pieces were hand-carved of ebony and ivory, played on a black and white marbled board, and stored in a padded teak case. In the early 1360s DR, [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold these for 20 [[gp]].

;Avatar Set:
:The Avatar Set available from Aurora's Emporium in the early 1360s DR was made of hardwoods from around [[Loudwater]] finely carved to resemble figures from the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. They were reduced to 15 gp in a special clearance following mysterious warehouse fires.

;Horde Set
:Also available from Aurora's Emporium in the early 1360s DR, the limited-edition Horde Set made with special permission from the kingdom of Cormyr commemorated the defeat of the [[Tuigan Horde]] in [[1360 DR]]. Pieces were made from stone and gilded [[iron]] with life-like and flattering depictions of the common soldiers and leaders. Sold for 25 gp, it was popular with lesser Cormyrean nobles and encouraged them to learn the game.

;Witch Lords Set
:This unnamed set kept in an antechamber in Castle Obarskyr in [[Suzail]], Cormyr, around 1369 DR was inspired by the [[Battle with the Witch Lords|battles]] between the [[Glory of Cormyr]] and the [[Witch Lords]] in [[900 DR]]. The white pieces were carved of [[moonstone]] with good likenesses of the figures depicted.

;Magical Chessman of Ultham-Urre
:The ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' was a set of chess pieces that were themselves magical [[artifact]]s with an array of powers. Made from luspeel, each was uniquely carved to resemble a lifelike [[Chessenta]]n citizen, inlaid with [[jacinth]]s for a red set and [[beljuril]]s for a green set. In particular, those who used them would be transformed into the figure depicted, while the rooks turned into instant fortresses.

==Reputation==
According to [[Aurora]], chess was considered the most challenging and interesting of the four "universal" games. It was said that rulers waged war with their armies in the summer, and practiced war with chess in the winter. She called it the "king of games" and the "game of kings".

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], chess was known to be played across Faerûn, in Cormyr,<ref> in [[Elmwood]] and [[Voonlar]] in the [[Moonsea]] lands, and at the [[Mithrest Inn]] in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. Chess was also played in the taverns, inns, and clubs of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]], such as [[The Salty Dog]]. The lanceboard variant was popular at the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1370 DR]].

Hermit [[alaghi]] enjoyed chess, among other games of strategy. They were likely the best chess players one could find on Toril.

Even [[devil]]s played chess; [[Asmodeus]] and [[Rumjal]] once enjoyed playing together.{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|24}} Death was also no obstacle to a love of the game—the [[ghost]] of [[Seiringlast]] of [[Seiringlast House]] in Ravens Bluff would apparently replace the chess-set and play with another spirit.

There were a number of books written just on how to play and master chess. One was ''[[Chess Variations of the Masters of Old Impiltur]]''.

[[File:Red-Knight symbol.jpg|thumb|right|''A red knight-errant chess piece and the holy symbol of the goddess Red Knight.'']]
The [[Red Knight]], the goddess of strategy and titled the Grandmaster of the Lanceboard, used a red knight-errant piece as her [[holy symbol]] and named her sword ''[[Checkmate]]''. She showed her favor by manifesting chessboards, red chess pieces, and even [[stone guardian]]s in the shape of chess pieces. Her chapels used such chess imagery and even life-sized lanceboards, and the clergy held day-long chess tournaments on the Queen's Gambit festival on [[Tarsakh 1]]. The clergy used the spell ''[[knight's move]]'' inspired by the knight-errant piece.

The [[Chessmen of Valsprendar]] was a circle of eleven standing stones marking a burial site in the hamlet of [[Wright's Ferry]] in the [[Dalelands]]. They were named for the game of chess.<ref>

==History==
The game known as chess, lanceboard, or castles was apparently based on the ancient [[elf|elven]] board game of ''[[Coroniir]]'', or "crowns" in [[Common]]. [[Lilianviaten Dlardrageth]] felt that [[human]]s had brutalized what [[elves]] had invented, as with most great things.{{Cite digital book/Shadowbane|1734}}

Chess was known in Chessenta (no relation) around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. For example, during the reign of King [[Tchazzar]] ([[929 DR|929]]–[[1018 DR]]), the [[archmage]] [[Ultham|Ultham, son of Urrekanam]], spent many hours playing chess with the elders of the village of [[Oslin]], and created the ''Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre'' to protect his friends there before he journeyed into the [[planes]]. For several years, they were just used as simple chess pieces.

Chess was known in Cormyr by around [[1200 DR]].

Some time in the 1300s DR, in The Salty Dog tavern in [[Ravens Bluff]], the mage [[Mastraero]] of [[Calaunt]] lost at chess to an unwashed sailor and in his rage turned every witness into a snail. But he missed his opponent, Ambassador [[Carrague]], who promptly restored everyone's proper forms, and they got their revenge.

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, King [[Theris]] of [[Mourktar]] in [[Threskel]] held athletic competitions to choose his successor. Alongside archery, boxing, charioteering, discus, jumping, riding, running, swimming, and wrestling, chess was one of the events.

In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, in Cormyr, [[Vangerdahast]] and [[Dimswart]] played in Castle Obarskyr whilst discussing the Tuigan incursion with King Azoun.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[War Wizards]] [[Huldyl Rauthur]] and [[Kurthryn Shandarn]] played a game of chess whilst on guard duty in Castle Obarskyr during the [[abraxus affair]] and discussed the events of the time over it. Their game was interrupted by [[Gwennath]] announcing the death of Baron [[Thomdor Ammaeth]]. Huldyl surrendered when Kurthryn checked his king. Unknown to them, the [[Harper]] [[Emthrara Undril]] was shapeshifted as the white queen piece.{{Cite dragon/276/The New Adventures of Volo: Cormyrian Contracts|77}} Azoun played with [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] afterward, but won each time despite Giogi's tactics and research.
