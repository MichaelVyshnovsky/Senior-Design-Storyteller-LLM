A '''''black sickle''''' was a [[magic]]al [[sickle]] of unholy power.

==Powers==
In combat, the ''black sickle'' could be wielded as a ''sickle +2''.

This evil [[weapon]] was the bane of plants and [[Plant creature|plant-based creatures]]. Upon striking a normal plant, it suffered an instant withering death along with all other normal plants and vegetation within a radius of 30 feet (9 meters). Plant-based monsters ([[myconid]]s, [[shambling mound]]s, [[treant]]s, and so forth) had a chance of resisting this herbicidal fate, but even if they managed to avoid it, they were compelled to make like a tree and leaf the area at once.
