'''Ahghairon's Statue''' was a large sculpture located within the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
Ahghairon's Statue was located in the central section of the City of the Dead near the entryway.

==Description==
Made completely from [[marble]], the tall statue depicted a detailed representation of the bearded [[wizard]] [[Ahghairon]] as an old man in his prime. The smiling statue stood atop a series of concentric steps and faced west toward the entryway into the City of the Dead with hands outstretched. Torches lit the steps at night.
