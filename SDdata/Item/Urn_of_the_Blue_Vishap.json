        "mainbody": "The Urn of the Blue Vishap was a unique Zakharan magical item commanding a powerful creature.\nThis item was aptly named, being an urn richly adorned in gold and blue with themes from the sea with a vishaps head decorating its lid. It could change in height from one to four feet.\nThe Urn held the blue dragon Saluuknir in bounds. The holder of the urn could ask the mighty dragon to perform three tasks. Saluuknir was not only forced to fulfil these wishes, but also prevented from attacking the possessor of the urn or anyone else, except in defense of himself or his prison. The Urn of the Blue Vishap also granted its prisoner some magic abilities beyond its great natural powers.\nThe Urn was originally created as a genie prison by accomplished shair Shalik ibn Shakuffar, who used it to trap the evil marid Merifa of the Pearl Lagoons. The item was then sent outside of Zakhara, where Merifa managed to escape its power by tricking Saluuknir into exchanging places. The blue dragon had been seeking for ways to escape the urn and take revenge on the marid ever since. Four centuries after it left the Land of Fate, the Urn of the Blue Vishap was acquired by a corsair and brought back to Zakhara. Rumour had it, that in 1367 DR it was in the possession of the master of Assassin Mountain."
