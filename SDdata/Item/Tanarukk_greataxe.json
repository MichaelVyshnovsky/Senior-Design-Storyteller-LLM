        "mainbody": "'''''Tanarukk greataxes''''' were a type of crude, but effective [[axe]]s created by the [[tanar'ri]]-tainted [[orcs]], Tanarukka of the [[Dragonspear Castle]].",
        "Powers": "These weapons were massive double-edged axes made for cleaving humans rather than trees. Each ''Tanarukk greataxe'' was imbued with a basic enchantment that heated the weapon as it slashed at an opponent. The magical fire damage was minimal, however, compared to most other enchanted weapons.",
        "History": "''Tanarukk greataxes'' were used by the tanarukka and orc forces of the demon [[Gorgomorz]], ''circa'' [[1372 DR]] during the [[Zhentarim]] plot against [[Daggerford]]."
