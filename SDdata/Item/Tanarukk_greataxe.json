        "mainbody": "Tanarukk greataxes were a type of crude, but effective axes created by the tanarri-tainted orcs, Tanarukka of the Dragonspear Castle.\nThese weapons were massive double-edged axes made for cleaving humans rather than trees. Each Tanarukk greataxe was imbued with a basic enchantment that heated the weapon as it slashed at an opponent. The magical fire damage was minimal, however, compared to most other enchanted weapons.\nTanarukk greataxes were used by the tanarukka and orc forces of the demon Gorgomorz, circa 1372 DR during the Zhentarim plot against Daggerford."
