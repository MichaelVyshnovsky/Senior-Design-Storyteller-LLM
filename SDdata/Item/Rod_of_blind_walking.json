        "mainbody": "rod of blind walking was a magical rod that allowed a blind user to perceive the location of nearby objects.\nThe rod gave its user a psychic awareness of the location of nearby objects, allowing for maneuverability around obstacles that was often superior to what could be achieved by creatures with functional eyes. This power did not work if the rod of blind walking was wielded by someone with functional eyesight.\nThe drow wizard Dostrealt owned a rod of blind walking."
