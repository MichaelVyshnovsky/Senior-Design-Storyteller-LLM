        "mainbody": "okharic was the name of a script used by the Draconic language, as well as by the Auran, Ignan, and some human languages. It consisted of runic characters equivalent to letters and numbers in human scripts.\nTo give emphasis to important concepts, Iokharic employed a special character consisting of five (or six) lines radiating outwards, similar to a star or an asterisk (*), or the five heads of Tiamat. When this character was written, the word was spoken with both the first and last syllables stressed.\nthumb|right|Graffiti of Cult of the Dragon symbol and Iokharic writing.\nDragons believed Iokharic was created by the dragon god Asgorath so his creations could record their impressions of the world he hoped they would inherit.\nElven scholars had the theory that kobolds, rather than dwarves, were the ones who actually created Iokharic, as it was widely believed that the earliest kobolds served dragons, learning dragon ways. The oldest historical records of kobold history began with paintings, then pictograms, and gradually developed into the Iokharic script.\nCirca 1479 DR, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern Blacklake District of Neverwinter with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and a symbol. Locals believed the images were evil and worried of a devil-worshiping cult in the area. They were mistakenâ€”it was a dragon-worshiping cult.\nThe following languages commonly used Iokharic writing for their written forms\n* Auran\n* Chultan\n* Draconic\n* Halruaan\n* Ignan\n* Lantanese\n* Netherese\n* Nexalan\n* Shou\n* Yipyak"
