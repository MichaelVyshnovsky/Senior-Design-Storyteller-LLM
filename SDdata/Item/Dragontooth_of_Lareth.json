        "mainbody": "A dragontooth of Lareth was a +1 flaming burst dragonfang dagger that was made from fangs pulled from the dead gold dragon Lareth.\nThe edge of a dragontooth of Lareth was made from a fang of the gold dragon Lareth. It was serrated and curved. The daggers hilt and pommel was made to look like a dragon and was decorated with a ruby, which was put into the mouth of the ornamental dragon.\nThis fang was treated to become a dragonfang dagger, a type of dragoncraft item that held the mundane power of hurting people stabbed by it with heat.\nIt was further enchanted to become a +1 flaming burst dagger. An additional power of this dagger was to allow the user to rapidly cast guidance on him- or herself. This ability of the dagger was believed to function by calling upon the spirit of the former King of Justice, who remained on Toril, for aid.\nAs mentioned above, a dragontooth of Lareth was created from one of Lareths fangs. However, it was possible to replicate the process with any dragonfang weapon. The creator needed functional theoretical knowledge about the creation of magic weapons but also the knowledge about how to create dragoncraft items. Added to this was skill at mundane weaponsmithing and the ability to enhance the casting speed of the spells necessary for the creation. These were guidance and any one of the following three spells fireball, flame blade, or flame strike.\nLareth was once the King of Justice of gold dragons. He tried to protect the metallic dragons by putting them all into a kind of magical slumber during the Rage of Dragons caused by Sammaster in 1373 DR. After Lareths death, at least twelve fangs were pulled from his corpse to create the dragonteeth of Lareth and distributed among the Talons of Justices leaders to honor his sacrifice in trying to save the dragons.\nIt was believed that Lareths spirit remained on Toril to repent for his failure by aiding the bearers of the dragonteeth of Lareth with his wisdom, which manifested in the form of the daggers guidance ability.\nThe leaders of the Talons of Justice each received a dragontooth of Lareth."
