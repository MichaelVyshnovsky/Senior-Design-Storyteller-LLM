        "mainbody": "The '''Circled Serpent''' was an artifact which could be used to open two ''portals''. Both were located on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. One ''portal'' lead to [[Smaragd]], [[Sseth]]'s layer in the [[Abyss]], the other to the lair of [[Dendar]] the Night Serpent on the [[Fugue Plane]].\n\n[[Arvin]] used the Circled Serpent to open the ''portal'' to Smaragd and destroyed the artifact after he had rescued [[Karrell]] and returned with her from that plane.",
