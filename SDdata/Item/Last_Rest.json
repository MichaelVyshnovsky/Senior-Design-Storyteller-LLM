        "mainbody": "Last Rest was the enchanted flail that belonged to Felina Tatch who crusaded against the undead.\nLast Rest possessed a +2 enchantment. The flail head was forged out of cold iron, yet was warm to the touch and emitted a faint glow. Upon contact with the undead, the flails head health them additional damage and had a chance of eliminating the target undead creature altogether. Additionally, the Last Rest allowed the wielder to cast the light spell at will.\nThis enchanted light flail once was wielded by Felina Tatch, a priestess who made it her lifes goal to destroy all vile undead. This act was not motivated by hate but rather by the desire to free the suffering should bound to their shambling unholy husks. Eventually, the clerics crusade brought her to a conflict with vampire Milikaia. She slew and subjugated Felina. However, soon after her death, the undead priestess was seen wandering through the graveyard of her hometown, destroying the undead. Milikaias fate was unknown.\nAt some point after Felinas death, Last Rest was broken into two parts, the haft, and the flail head. In 1372 DR, both pieces were discovered by the Hero of Daggerford, one in a pile of \"treasures\" in Torleth Mindulspeers store in Gillians Hill, and the other in possessions of necromancer Daxiong who laired in the graveyard of Gillians Hill. The flail was reforged in Daggerford by Derval Ironeater for 2,500 gold pieces."
