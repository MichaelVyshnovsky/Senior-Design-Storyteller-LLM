The '''''Lucky Knucky''''' was a small good luck charm that has a long history in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
The ''Lucky Knucky'' was a small unassuming lump of [[knucklehead]] bone.

==Powers==
Simply carrying the ''Lucky Knucky'' granted the owner good luck and better chances of avoiding harm and increased chances of shaking off negative effects and conditions.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''Lucky Knucky'' had been giving good luck to its owners for almost twenty years. The charm remained in the town of Targos ever since its first owner – a fisher named [[Young Ned]] of [[Lonelywood]], survived his boat capsizing in the cold waters of [[Maer Dualdon]] off the Targos's shores. Ned survived by clinging to an "unbelievably massive" knucklehead – the man's prized catch of the day. After reaching the shore, Young Ned and his giant [[fish]] were attacked by a hungry [[bear]] who got away with most of the knucklehead. The only part of the fish left with the fisher was its head. Young Ned carried the head with him back to Targos as proof of the adventure. He kept the "Lucky Knucky" with him and started believing that it was the reason for all the good luck in the fisherman's life.

The "Lucky Knucky's" next owner was the bandit named [[Marg the Trembler]], who won the charm from Young Ned in a card game through cheating. Soon after the win, Marg exchanged the "Lucky Knucky" for supplies and fled Targos. The next owner of the lucky bone kept it for several months before gifting it to a friend in Targos's docks.

By 1312 DR, the ''Lucky Knucky'' changed hands, gifted, traded, and sold by a dozen people in Targos and once reached [[Bremen]]. The latest known owner of the ''Lucky Knucky'' was [[Jemeliah]], an employee of the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in Targos.
