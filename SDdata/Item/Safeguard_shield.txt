'''''Safeguard shield''''' was an heirloom [[shield]] of a [[wizard]]ing family whose magic became trapped in it over the course of many family dinners, giving it a minor [[enchantment]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This shield possessed a minor protective magic that made it a bit easier for the wielder to avoid being affected by various [[spell]]s; to shrug off [[poison]]s, [[disease]]s, and other harmful effects; and to dodge deadly spells and traps. It wasn't bad as a shield either.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Dammon]], a [[tiefling]] smith refugee from the city of [[Elturel]], who sought safety within the [[Emerald Grove]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
