'''Tree seats''' were handy items used by [[ranger]]s and others who spent time travelling through the wilds of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Uses==
With a tree seat, a ranger could turn any sturdy tree into his own fortress or watchtower. Using a tree seat almost always guaranteed that the user was not surprised by an enemy. These items were made from [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and had steel claws that never slipped.

'''DISCLAIMER''': Use of this item on [[treant]]s voided the manufacturer's warranty.

==Prices==
A tree seat cost 15 [[gold piece]]s from [[Aurora's Emporium]].
