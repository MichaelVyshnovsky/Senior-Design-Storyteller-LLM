Tree seats were handy items used by rangers and others who spent time travelling through the wilds of Faer√ªn.
With a tree seat, a ranger could turn any sturdy tree into his own fortress or watchtower. Using a tree seat almost always guaranteed that the user was not surprised by an enemy. These items were made from duskwood and had steel claws that never slipped.
DISCLAIMER Use of this item on treants voided the manufacturers warranty.
A tree seat cost 15 gold pieces from Auroras Emporium.
