Halasters magnifying glass was an enchanted lens, imbued with powerful magics yet virtually useless, presumably created by the Mad Mage of Undermountain, Halaster Blackcloak himself.
This item was warm to the touch and was pulsing with powerful and almost palpable magic. Strangely enough, Halasters magnifying glass did no actual magnifying and functionally offered no optic aid, and seemingly was completely useless. However, if used against insect creatures such as fomorians, Halasters magnifying glass was a surprisingly powerful implement of torture.
In the late 14 century DR, Halasters magnifying glass could be found within the mega-dungeon underneath Waterdeep â€“ Undermountain, in possessions of a decrepitly old blue dragon.
