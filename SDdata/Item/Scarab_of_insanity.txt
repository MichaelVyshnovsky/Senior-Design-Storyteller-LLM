A '''''scarab of insanity''''' was a dangerous [[magical item]] that could be used to drive others mad.

==Description==
A ''scarab'' seemed like a harmless piece of jewellery, such as a mundane [[amulet]], brooch, or scarab.

==Powers==
When the ''scarab of insanity'' was displayed and the [[command word]] spoken, all other creatures within 20 feet of the bearer were potentially afflicted with (hopefully) temporary insanity for a minute or so, rendering them incapable of any coherent thought or reason, similar to a ''[[confusion]]'' spell.

==History==
* The gem-dealer and [[adventurer]] Zircon Gemfacet was blasted with a ''scarab of insanity'' and was rendered permanently insane as a result, becoming [[Zurk the Looney]].
