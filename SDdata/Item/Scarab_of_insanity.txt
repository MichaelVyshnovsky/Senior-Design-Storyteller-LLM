A scarab of insanity was a dangerous magical item that could be used to drive others mad.
A scarab seemed like a harmless piece of jewellery, such as a mundane amulet, brooch, or scarab.
When the scarab of insanity was displayed and the command word spoken, all other creatures within 20 feet of the bearer were potentially afflicted with (hopefully) temporary insanity for a minute or so, rendering them incapable of any coherent thought or reason, similar to a confusion spell.
* The gem-dealer and adventurer Zircon Gemfacet was blasted with a scarab of insanity and was rendered permanently insane as a result, becoming Zurk the Looney.
