        "mainbody": "The '''''Mercykiller's belt''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[belt]] once worn by the factol [[Dom (factol)|Dom]] of [[Sigil]] ''circa'' the early 10{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ''Mercykiller's belt'' was a thick and wide [[leather]] belt crafted using the hide of a creature unknown on [[Toril]]. It was bound in polished [[copper]] strips. The belt front center was decorated with a circle of polished cream-colored [[malachite]] carved into an emblem showing a [[winged serpent]] with its maw open and fangs facing outward – the symbol of the Mercykillers. The malachite was affixed in place with copper loops running between layers of the alien hide. The belt buckled in the back with hefty [[steel]] clasps.",
        "Powers": "The ''Mercykiller's belt'' significantly boosted the wearer's physical strength.",
        "History": "Sages discovered the mysterious belt's history stretching all the way to the {{YearlinkName|912}}. It was created ''circa'' that year in the extra-planar city of Sigil to be worn by factol Dom, a [[Prison (sigil)|Prison]] warden for the [[Mercykillers]] faction. Dom gained infamy after being a part of the [[Great Break]] event organized by the [[Free League]] of Sigil – the only mass Prison break in the penitentiary's long history. The factol was held responsible for the grand failure, stripped of his rank, and convicted to spend five years in the very same Prison. After release, Dom spent thirty years tracking down all escapees and bringing them to justice.\n\nBy the age of sixty-seven, Dom was still on his quest, but the age was taking its toll. The ''Mercykiller's belt'' was fashioned to boost the man's failing strength. Three years later, the last of the criminals were brought to justice. Dom reported to the Prison's new warden, filled all the needed paperwork out, and died less than an hour later from exhaustion.\n\nBy some unknown means, the ''Mercykiller's belt'' found its way to Toril, where, in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, it belonged to the [[mind flayer]] [[Oinchack'Olp]] in the [[Underdark]] tunnels under the [[Spine of the World]] and [[Icewind Dale]]. The belt might've been rewarded to a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]], who stood against the [[Legion of the Chimera]] in 1312 DR."
