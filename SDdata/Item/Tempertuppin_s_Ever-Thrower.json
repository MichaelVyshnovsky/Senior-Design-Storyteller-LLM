        "History": "These slings were created by [[Bindle Tempertuppin|Bindle \"Eye-nock\" Tempertuppin]], who claimed he witnessed a [[fire giant]] using a similar weapon but  \"big enough to throw a [[donkey]] 300 paces\". He, however, did not appreciate anyone questioning this and usually responded humorously with \"you'll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling.\"\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tempertuppin's slings could be found in [[Neverwinter]] and the [[Moonsea]] region."
