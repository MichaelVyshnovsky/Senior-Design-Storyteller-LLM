        "mainbody": "Tempertuppins Ever-Throwers were enchanted slings that magically produced their own bullets.\nTempertuppins Ever-Throwers possessed a +1 enchantment, and similarly to the weapon that inspired them, magically materialized bullets that were engulfed in flames and exploded upon reaching the target.\nThese slings were created by Bindle \"Eye-nock\" Tempertuppin, who claimed he witnessed a fire giant using a similar weapon but  \"big enough to throw a donkey 300 paces\". He, however, did not appreciate anyone questioning this and usually responded humorously with \"youll be sorry when a giant puts YOUR ass in a sling.\"\nBy the late 14 century DR, Tempertuppins slings could be found in Neverwinter and the Moonsea region."
