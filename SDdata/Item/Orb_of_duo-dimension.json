        "mainbody": "n orb of duo-dimension was an orb that was used in surface raids by the drow.\nThe orbs surfaces were&mdashexcept on the side they were held by&mdash pierced with holes. Inside these orbs were the ashes of a drow.\nAn orb of duo-dimensions contents could be shaken out on saying the command word that unsealed the orbs holes. These holes were sealed with invisible magical force, which the command word made relax.\nBy shaking the contents out on a mammalian creature, the creature was under the effect of a duo-dimension spell for seven minutes. The effect took one minute to manifest and was accompanied by a tingling sensation.\nThe orb of duo-dimension was a magic item associated with the drow. They used it in their surface raids or sneak attacks in the Underdark. To put simply, they used it every time they wanted to navigate through narrow caverns without opening up big tunnels, which their enemies could use against them.\nOn his first surface raid, Drizzt DoUrden was put under the effect of an orb of duo-dimension to enter the surface."
