A '''''Netherese glass disk''''' was the name given to a specific type of disk-shaped [[magic]]al item that originated from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]] that allowed an individual to travel without being noticed.
{{Quote|Go to [[Dekanter]]. Your disk was born there, lost there, and found there not so long ago. A century or two at most.|A [[:category:seers|seer]] of [[Candlekeep]] to the mage [[Druhallen]].}}

==Description==
The disk of dark glass was typically cool to the touch, though it could grow warmer under certain circumstances. When thrown it would light up with a vivid radiance, float in the air, and slowly descend towards the ground. It was considered to be a very simple [[item enchantment|enchantment]] for the era in which it was made.

==Powers==
While a glass disk created no effects when carried in a pack or other form of storage, when touched by an individual, it caused them to be imperceptible to anyone that was not expected to encounter them.

==History==
One of these disks was uncovered by a band of [[Red Wizards]] from [[Thay]], and used for their hit-and-run ambushes for a number of years. They carried it during their assault against a caravan headed from the city of [[Scornubel]] to [[Hlondeth]], in the {{YearlinkName|1353}}, but lost it during the ensuing battle.

The disk was recovered by the mage Druhallen and carried with him during his journeys across the Realms. He sought answers about its origins at Candlekeep, before finally finding some peace and insight thanks to his time spent studying one of the fabled ''[[Nether Scroll]]s'' and a conversation with [[Lady Wyndyfarh]] of [[Weathercote Wood]].
