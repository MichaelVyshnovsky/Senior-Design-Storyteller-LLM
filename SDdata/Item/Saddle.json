Riding saddles were used by those who rode creatures, whilst pack saddles were frames used to carry equipment.) Military saddles were also available, and were used by commanders and generals in battle. Exotic saddles were used to mount specific types of creatures, such as aquatic and aerial mounts.\nThese seats were sold all over Faer√ªn, Kara-Tur, and Zakhara.\nSaddles specifically made for camels had different names in Zakhara and were known as kharj, rahla, and terke. The rahla was small, comfortable and lightweight, whilst the terke was cage-like and enabled the rider to control the camel much more easily.\nAs well as animals, mechanical machines such as the Leaping Lizard of Ravens Bluff, were seated with saddles. Citizens of the city could mount the ride for 2 cp each.\nSaddle frames were often made of wood or sheepskin. Saddles were sold by Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, and each of them were made from black Ordulan leather. \nSaddles manufactured in Calimshan had especially tall cantles.\nSuch seats came in a multitude of varieties, each different depending on the riders needs or the type of mount used. Types of mounts that used saddles were horses, mules, wolves, griffons, hippogriffs, steeders, pegasi, dragons, giant striders, and camels. Even dolphins could have saddles fitted to them, as well as owlbears, axebeaks, hippocampi, purple worms, giant fireflies, giant lizards, veserabs, pteranadons, giant ravens, wyverns, stone flyers, nightmares, and carrion crawlers.\nTraveling on saddles (particularly poor ones) for long periods could cause bad sores.\nInstead of making saddles from scratch, arcane methods could be used. The mount spell could summon creatures with saddles already attached to them, or even howdahs, should the caster be powerful enough. Even the phantom steed spell summoned a ghostly mount with a saddle and bit and bridle to boot.\nSaddles first became available in Netheril in .\n1345 DR was known as the Year of the Saddle. The High Herald of Yartar was known as the Gold Saddle. In addition, the settlement of Lheshayl had an inn known as the Saddle of the Plains, Hills Edge featured an inn called the Stone Saddle, and a body of water in Longsaddle was known as the Saddle Pond.\nthumb|273px|A giant strider wearing a saddle.\nThere were many notable saddles of the Realms, including those that could fit exotic beasts of all shapes and sizes.
