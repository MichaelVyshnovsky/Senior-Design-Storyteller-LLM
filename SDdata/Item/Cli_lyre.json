        "Description": "''Cli lyres'' were superior in every way to ordinary lyres. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by [[bard]]s, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.",
        "Powers": "Bards wielding a ''Cli lyre'' had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\n\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these lyres had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a ''Cli lyre'' could invoke the spells ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[Protection from evil|protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'' and ''[[wind wall]]'' each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.\n\nLesser versions of ''Cli lyres'' allowed for casting the ''[[haste]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[sound burst]]'' spells.",
        "History": "The first ''Cli lyres'' were created by a legendary bard in the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. He used them to test and reward the students of the Cli level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.\n\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]] several powerful magical items, including a ''Cli lyre'', were brought to [[Toril]] by a planeswalking [[wizard]] [[Vejoni H. Wyzz]] who perched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of [[Liam's Hold]].\n\nA mundane but exquisitely crafted ''Falataeric Cli lyre'' was sold at the [[Chromatic Scale]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. It was believed that it was one of the twenty surviving lyres hand-crafted by Falataer of the Moonshaes."
