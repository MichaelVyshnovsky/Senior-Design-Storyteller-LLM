Aiedo wither-sticks were enchanted reed staves from the southern land of the Shaar.
Aiedos reed staves possessed a +1 enchantment and had a good chance of affecting the targets strength upon a successful strike, making them noticeably weaker and frail.
Meng Aiedo, a weapon maker renowned for his work with various tall grasses and bamboo of Kara-Tur, discovered a sturdy species of reed in the Lhespenbogs reed-fields in the Eastern Shaar. From those plants, Aiedo started crafting the so-called Aiedo wither-sticks.
By the late 14 century DR, Aiedos reed weapons found their way to the Sword Coast region and eventually fell into the hands of quarterstaff users in the city of Neverwinter.
