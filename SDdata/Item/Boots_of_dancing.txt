'''''Boots of dancing''''' were ''[[cursed]]'' magic [[boots]] that made their wearer ineffective in combat, but at least a good dancer. The curse was undetectable via ''[[identify]]'', with the boots appearing to be a different type of enchanted boots.

==Description==
''Boots of dancing'' adjusted their size to fit any creature attempting to put them on,{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1991|285|Boots of Dancing}}

==Powers==
The curse put on these boots forced the wearer to start dancing uncontrollably when entering a physical altercation, or even when attempting to flee from one. The magic kept the wearer in place, dancing, unable to intentionally move or attack, becoming an easy target for their opponents as if affected by ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]''. ''Boots of dancing'' could only be removed via ''[[remove curse]]''.

However, after the [[Spellplague]], the magic that enchanted ''boots of dancing'' changed. Instead of forcing the wearer to dance, making them vulnerable in combat, these boots made the wearer dance gracefully out of the way of danger once activated.

==Creation==
''Boots of dancing'' could be crafted by a person proficient in creating magical items using the ''Otto's irresistible dance'' [[spell]].

==History==
During the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], these ''cursed'' boots could be found in the [[Dalelands]], areas surrounding [[Freedale]] and [[Shadowdale]],
