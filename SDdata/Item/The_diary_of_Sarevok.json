        "mainbody": "The diary of Sarevok told the story of Sarevok Anchev and the events he was involved in before the Iron Throne set the Iron crisis on the Sword Coast in motion and during the iron crisis itself until Gorions Ward stopped the Iron Throne operations in the Cloakwood. The timeline of the diary is not in line with that of the Baldurs Gate game, because the prophecy should have been fulfilled somewhere between year 1369 and 1370, whereas the diary of Sarevok has dates in 1370.\nThe diary was in the possession of Cythandria in the Iron Throne headquarters in Baldurs Gate."
