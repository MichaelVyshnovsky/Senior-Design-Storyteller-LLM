        "mainbody": "graystaff, or a staff of frost, was a mundane staff used by bheurs as a magical focus for powerful spells.\nA graystaff was a gnarled wooden staff taller than a bheur. It was not inherently magical and only had powers when held by the bheur who had crafted it.\nWhen held by a bheur, the staff allowed her to create powerful magical effects, including cone of cold, hold person, ice storm, solid fog, and wall of ice. Unless she held her graystaff, she could not cast these spells.\nA graystaff was made from a wood that could not be found on the Prime Material Plane. It took at least a year for a bheur to craft her staff.\nCategoryItems\nCategoryWooden items\nCategoryStaves\njetqg4zol5rw3t1wuiqjjiw1tagtm10"
