'''Hourglasses''', also known as '''sandglasses''' or '''sand-clocks''', were a type of tool used for tracking the passage of time. They typically tracked the passage of one or more hours, hence their name, though some known as '''minuteglasses''' were designed to track specific minute timeframes.

==Description==
[[File:Wizard Hourglass.png|thumb|200px|''A wizard ponders his hourglass.'']]
An hourglass consisted of two bulbous, glass globes connected by a narrow passage. These globes were held together by a frame, typically made of wood, that itself was held together by twine and [[screw]]s. The [[glass]] globes were filled with [[sand]] that traveled from the topmost bulb to the lower one, passing through the narrow passage that connected them.

==Variants==
* Egg timer: A type of small sandglass{{Cite organized play/LC/In the Hall of the Mountain Mage|9}} that was used to keep track of time while cooking.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/How Long Can You Tread Water?|12,25}}
* [[Scornubrian sandglass]]: A type of minuteglass that was produced in the city of [[Scornubel]].{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing}}

==History==
Hourglasses dated as far back as the time of [[Netheril]], where they first became available in {{YearlinkConvert|2108|NY}}.

Throughout the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered one and two hour sandglasses, as well as minuteglasses that counted intervals of ten minutes, five minutes, one minute, and a half-minute. All of these timepieces within the catalogue were both casted and given an ornate paintjob in the land of [[Calimshan]], then filled with precise measurements of sand in [[Waterdeep]].

==Notable Users of Hourglasses==
===Classes===
* [[Mage]]s sometimes had hourglasses among their belongings.
* A proper [[wizard]]'s laboratory in the Realms typically contained sandglasses that counted intervals of a half-minute, minute, five minute, and hour. They were considered to be crucial for tracking the success of chemical research.
===Magic===
* An hourglass constructed of [[gold]] and [[silver]] was used to house ''[[aquamarine of spell extending|aquamarines of spell extending]]''.
===Religions===
* The ancient deity [[Chronos]] was typically depicted alongside an hourglass.

==Trivia==

* The [[Temple Beyond Time]] was in the shape of an elongated hourglass.
* Within the center of [[Winterspace]] was a cluster of stars that many observers described as resembling an hourglass.
