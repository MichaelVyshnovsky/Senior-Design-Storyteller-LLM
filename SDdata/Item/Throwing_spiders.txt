Throwing spiders were metallic weapons similar to shuriken with extremely sharp edges.
These weapons were stylized to look like spiders by the drow. If left in an area strong with faerzress, they became supernaturally sharp, capable of digging into wood and even stone with ease.
Before leaving the Underdark, Liriel Baenre used to visit ZzPzoras lair and leave objects in the intense faerzress of the location, hoping those items absorbed some of the magical emanations.
Xzorsh was given a few of these weapons, which were bestowed a different enchantment by Liriel. They would burrow into anything they were pressed against, be it flesh or even wood, which made them extremely lethal.Elaine Cunningham (May 1998). Tangled Webs. (Wizards of the Coast).
