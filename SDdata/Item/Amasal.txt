'''''Amasal''''' was an enchanted sword that was once carried by the [[elf]] hero [[Gaeleath]].

==Description==
''Amasal's'' blade was forged from a black and greenish metal.

==Powers==
It was a ''+4 [[broadsword]]''. ''Amasal's'' wielder was able to choose any of the following [[spell]]-like powers to use: ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[anti-magic shell]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', and ''[[incendiary cloud]]''. They could use these powers up to three times per day. These spell-like powers were used as if cast by an exceptionally skilled [[wizard]].

''Amasal's'' powers only functioned when within a mile of its twin blade ''[[Thael]]''.

==History==
The sword was carried into battle by Gaeleath and his twin brother against a horde of [[gnolls]] to defend [[Illefarn]]. The brothers perished during the battle, but ''Amasal'' was later recovered and brought to [[Taltempla]].
