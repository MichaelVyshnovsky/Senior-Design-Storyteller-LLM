Amasal was an enchanted sword that was once carried by the elf hero Gaeleath.
Amasals blade was forged from a black and greenish metal.
It was a +4 broadsword. Amasals wielder was able to choose any of the following spell-like powers to use lightning bolt, anti-magic shell, death spell, spell turning, and incendiary cloud. They could use these powers up to three times per day. These spell-like powers were used as if cast by an exceptionally skilled wizard.
Amasals powers only functioned when within a mile of its twin blade Thael.
The sword was carried into battle by Gaeleath and his twin brother against a horde of gnolls to defend Illefarn. The brothers perished during the battle, but Amasal was later recovered and brought to Taltempla.
