        "mainbody": "An Imaskari rod was a magical rod of Imaskari origin that was used to dispel magic, so as to better fight all things divine and druidic.\nThese rods were used to cast a powerful greater dispel magic spell three times a day.\nDespite being in common use by the ancient Imaskari Empire, most of the rods were long lost to the ages by the late 14 century DR. One of Imaskari rods could be found in the ruins underneath the Bear Gods Barrow, home to the great spirit Okku in the . This particular rod was damaged and cracked along its length and somehow radiated the feeling of being alive."
