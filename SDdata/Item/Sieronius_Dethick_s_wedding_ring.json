        "mainbody": "Sieronius Dethicks wedding ring was a cursed and enchanted wedding band that belonged to Sieronius Dethick, an undead priest of Vhaeraun.\nEven though the ring possessed beneficial enchantments, it, nevertheless, was cursed. Any person who put on Sieronius Dethicks wedding ring was unable to remove it by any means until their death or remove curse was cast.\nThe wedding bands magics unproved the wearers defenses against positive energy, granted them potent spell protection, and radiated the aura of glory once per day. Additionally, the ring allowed the wearer to call upon divine favor once per day.\nThis enchanted wedding band was affixed to the cursed vampire Sieronius Dethicks pale desiccated finger. Several centuries before 1372 DR, Sieronius was a living drow agent of the Church of Vhaeraun. This ring was the physical representation of the marital bond he shared with his beloved wife. Eventually, Sieronius was trapped deep in the tomb underneath what later came to be known as Liams Hold by Sunder Halyndliam and forcefully turned into a blood-sucking creature. Sieronius Dethick remained confined to the dungeon, unable to escape for centuries with only the wedding ring remaining to remind him of his wife, who was sure to have been dead for many years by the late 14 century DR.\nI 1372 DR, Sieronius attempted to escape the cursed confinement by forcefully marrying another woman. Even though Sieronius Dethicks wedding rings fate remained unclear, it was either still on the vampires finger as he left Liams Hold, or taken of the slain creatures desiccated finger by the Hero of Daggerford."
