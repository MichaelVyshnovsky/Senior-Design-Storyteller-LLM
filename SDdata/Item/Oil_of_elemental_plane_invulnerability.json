        "mainbody": "'''''Oils of elemental plane invulnerability''''' were a variety of different [[magic item|magical]] [[oil]]s that could protect one from the [[element]]s. There existed an oil for each of the [[Inner Planes]], the six major ones as well as the twelve minor planes.",
        "Description": "These oils came in flasks that had enough liquid to coat a single [[human]]-sized creature six times or six individuals once.",
        "Powers": "Those who applied one of these oils to their body were provided total invulnerability to the elemental environmental forces of their oil's respective plane. This included being able to breathe, see, and move around in it without difficulty. For example, those doused in an ''oil of [[Elemental Plane of Earth|earth]] elemental plane invulnerability'' could pass through the stone on that plane as if it were merely air.\n\nIn addition, these oils offered the same protections as an ''[[oil of elemental invulnerability]]''.",
        "Creation": "One of the known ingredients for these oils was some material from the appropriate elemental plane.",
        "Notable Users": "* These were among the magical items commonly used by [[planewalker]]s and could be purchased in the markets of [[Sigil]] at prices lower than those on the [[Prime Material plane]].\n* Some [[sha'ir]]s were known to craft these oils."
