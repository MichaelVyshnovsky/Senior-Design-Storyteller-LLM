        "Description": "Utter East curry often smelled of [[cinnamon]]",
        "Availability": "Roasted curried meats were a common dish in [[Calimshan]]. Their aromas permeated the streets of [[Calimport]]. [[Green Calishite]] [[cheese]], a popular export from the nation, was made with curry spices that dyed the cheese a radiant aquamarine hue.\n\nIn the city of [[Mirabar]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], curry was made of [[rice]], many [[egg]]s, [[lamb kidney]]s, [[almond]]s, and other kitchen leftovers. That delightful dish was served at [[The Sign of the Forgehammer]] and was a highlight for the eatery's menu. The nearby mountain town of [[Hundelstone]] served curried [[hare]] in [[brandy]] and roasted on skewers.\n\nThe [[Painted Boat Restaurant]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold curried [[goat]].\n\nCurried nuts were a customary food from [[Vaelan]] in the nation of [[Durpar]] in the [[Shining South]].\n\nIn [[Innarlith]] in the [[Land of the Lions]], platters of curried [[eel]]s were served as a delicacy.\n\nIn [[Zakhara]], [[rice]] was curried with [[onion]]s and [[raisin]]s, and served in huge tureens alongside other dishes.\n\nCurry was a common dish cooked for sailors and passengers aboard the ''[[Butterfly (ship)|Butterfly]]'' that sailed the [[Sea of Swords]]. It was said to be almost as hot and spicy as [[Maztica]]n stews.\n\nA [[gnomish]] and [[halfling]] delicacy called [[bhaerulb]] was a curry made with [[mealworm]]s and [[onion]]s (or substituted with [[leek]]s).{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} Common handfoods in the [[Realms]] were handpies, and some of them were stuffed with curries. [[Sornstag]] was a dish of curried venison, another common dish from across the Realms."
