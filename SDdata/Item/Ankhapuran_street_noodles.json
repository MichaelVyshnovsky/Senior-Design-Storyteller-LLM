        "mainbody": "Ankhapuran street noodles was a common street handfood of cooked and stuffed noodle pockets from Ankhapur in the Land of the Lions.\nAnkhapuran noodles were squares of noodle sheets that resembled human palm-sized flattened pillows. The dough was often made with dill and other herbs giving it a green color. The filling was a mix of cheese and scrambled egg, smoothly melted together, and the dough sheets were sealed with a variety of hard cheese. The filling was generously spiced. Cooked noodle squares were diagonally drizzled with more hard cheese and melted.\nIn the 14 century DR, Ankhapuran noodles were sold in abundance in Ankhapurs docks out of vendor carts."
