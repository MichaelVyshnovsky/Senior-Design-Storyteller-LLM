'''Pork loin''' was a cut of [[pig]], [[boar]], or [[hog]] meat and a dish found in several locales around [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
In the [[Eastern Heartlands|Eastern]] and [[Western Heartlands]], [[pork]] loins were traditionally slowly roasted drenched in [[apple]] and [[cider]] [[gravy]]. The same recipe could also be found served in the eateries of the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].

In [[Thay]], pork loins were coked in green pepper sauce.

Pork loins could also be braised in [[mustard]] sauce and served with [[goose]] [[Fowl liver|liver]] paté and crusty [[bread]].
