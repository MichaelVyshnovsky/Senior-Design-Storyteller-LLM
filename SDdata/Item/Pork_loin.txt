Pork loin was a cut of pig, boar, or hog meat and a dish found in several locales around Faerûn.
In the Eastern and Western Heartlands, pork loins were traditionally slowly roasted drenched in apple and cider gravy. The same recipe could also be found served in the eateries of the city of Baldurs Gate.
In Thay, pork loins were coked in green pepper sauce.
Pork loins could also be braised in mustard sauce and served with goose liver paté and crusty bread.
