'''''Cracker''''' and '''''Whacker''''' were twin [[morning star]]s that were the chief weapons of the [[dwarf]] [[Athrogate]].

==Description==
''Cracker'' and ''Whacker'' were both gray [[glassteel]] [[morning star]]s, with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of [[adamantine]] chains. The novels' descriptions of Athrogate's "morning stars" are very similar to that of [[flail]]s, especially in D&D v.3.5 rules. However, in medieval weaponry, the name "morning star" mainly referred to the spiked ball head of a weapon, which could be attached to a handle (like a mace) or a chain (like a flail). Therefore, this name and description of "morning star" are accurate. Athrogate generally wielded ''Cracker'' in the left hand and ''Whacker'' in the right hand.

==Powers==
On command, ''Cracker'' emitted from the small nubs on the striking ball a dark reddish and chalky fluid, the ichor of a [[rust monster]], which corroded other metals on contact.

==History==
In [[1484 DR]], Athrogate used his morning stars to smash through the iron wall sealing off [[Mithral Hall]] from the [[Underdark]].
