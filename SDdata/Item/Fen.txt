The fen was the lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.
The fen took the form of a copper coin with a hole through the center, similar to the yuan. Five fen were worth 1 yuan, 100 fen were worth 1 chao or 1 tael, and 1000 fen were worth 1 chien.
Thanks to their holes, collections of fens and yuans were threaded on strings in amounts of 50â€“100, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.
