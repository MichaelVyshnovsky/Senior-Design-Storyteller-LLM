The '''fen''' was the lowest unit of [[currency]] used in [[Kara-Tur]].

The fen took the form of a [[copper]] coin with a hole through the center, similar to the [[yuan]]. Five fen were worth 1 yuan, 100 fen were worth 1 [[ch'ao]] or 1 [[tael]], and 1000 fen were worth 1 [[ch'ien]].

Thanks to their holes, collections of fens and yuans were threaded on strings in amounts of 50â€“100, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.
