        "Powers": "A bard who wielded this drum was granted abilities to cast several spells: ''[[animate dead]]'', that consumed 3 charges per use; ''[[cause fear]]'' – 1 charge per casting; and ''[[fear]]'' – 2 charges er use. Each ''drum of haunting'' held up to 50 charges.",
        "History": "Sheer morbidness of the ''drums of haunting'' prevented many of its owners from displaying these magic items. Most often, these items were wielded by famous bards on battlefields or when circumstances made it necessary.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a ''drum of haunting'' could be found hidden in the secret rooms in the home of the Loremaster of [[Nimbre]] in [[Samarach]], [[Chult]]."
