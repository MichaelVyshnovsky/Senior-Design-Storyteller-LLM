Flaming Gullet was a spicy mixed alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14 century DR, such as the Hidden Lady.
Flaming Gullet drink was an amber-hued mixed drink. Its ingredients were carefully measured and consisted of klaraunth (a strong and clear distilled barley alcoholic beverage from Tethyr, Chessenta, or the Vilhon), a distillate of hot red radishes, a distillate of horseradish, and finely crushed and powdered chestnuts.
The drink was never to be served flaming, oftentimes contradicting tall-tales and boasts heard in taverns across Faerûn.
The name of the drink was a description of what the imbiber was to expect from consuming a flaming gullet. The fiery hot drink caused th sensation of searing fire in the drinkers throat and cleared any and all congestion the drinker could have been suffering from.
