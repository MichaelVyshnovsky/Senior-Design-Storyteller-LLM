        "Description": "This crimson-colored gem was the size of a [[cherry]].",
        "Powers": "So long as the ''Eye'' was visible, no creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire could harm the owner.\n\nThe owner could cast ''[[firefeed]]'' once per day to magically heal themselves when they touched any flame. When using this power, the intensity of the flame was directly related to the amount of healing granted, with stronger flames granting more healing than weaker ones. Any flame used to heal in this manner was immediately extinguished.\n\nOnce per week the bearer of the ''Eye'' could summon and command a large [[fire elemental]] as if the creature were summoned via a ''[[brazier of commanding fire elementals]]''.",
