        "mainbody": "'''''Ghost touch''''' was both an [[armor quality]] and a [[weapon quality]] that could be added to any weapon or armor to make it effective against incorporeal creatures.",
        "Powers": "Any armor, [[shield]], or weapon that possessed this quality was both corporeal and incorporeal simultaneously. This made armor more protective against incorporeal creatures, such as [[ghost]]s, and made weapons capable of harming them normally as though they were [[item enchantment|enchanted]]. However, this effect would not pass on to the ammunition fired by ranged weapons, such as [[arrow]]s and [[bullet]]s.\n\nAs items with this quality were considered incorporeal, such creatures were likewise capable of wielding them. Items with this quality were also able to pass through solid objects if the wielder desired.",
        "Creation": "The creator must use either the [[spell]] ''[[Ghost touch armor]]'' or ''[[ghost touch weapon]]'' when crafting the appropriate item to add this property.\n\nBesides armor and weapons, this quality could be applied to [[ring]]s, [[rod]]s, [[staff]]s, [[wand]]s, and wondrous items.",
        "Uses": "Some experienced [[Thayan gladiator]]s had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ''ghost touch'' weapons.",
        "Known ''Ghost Touch'' Weapons": "* ''[[Afterthought]]'', a ''+5 [[dagger]]'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality that was the personal weapon of the god of death [[Vecna]].\n* ''[[Arumdina]]'', a ''+5 [[battleaxe]]'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality that was the personal weapon of the [[gnome]] [[deity]] of luck  [[Garl Glittergold]].\n* ''[[Dawnspeaker]]'', a [[heavy mace]] with the ''ghost touch'' quality  that was the personal weapon of the deity [[Lathander]].\n* ''[[Ethereal action]]'',  a smooth wooden [[quarterstaff]] adorned with three silver bands and enchanted with ''+1 ghost touch''.\n* ''[[Gungnir]]'', a ''+5 [[shortspear]]'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality  that was the personal weapon of the interloper deity [[Odin]].\n* ''[[Fatal Touch]]'', a [[bastard sword]] with the ''ghost touch'' quality  that was the personal weapon of the death god [[Kelemvor]].\n* The interloper goddess [[Hecate]] possessed ''+5 dagger'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality.\n* The interloper god [[Ptah]] possessed a ''+5 heavy mace'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality.\n* The goddess [[Lolth]] possessed both a dagger and [[whip]] with the ''ghost touch'' quality.\n* ''[[Nightbreaker]]'', a ''+1 heavy mace'' with the ''ghost touch'' and ''[[disruption]]'' qualities that was sacred to the [[Church of Lathander]].<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/More Marches|3}}\n* ''[[Staff of ethereal action]]'', an enchanted quarterstaff.\n* ''[[Wraithblade]]'', an enchanted ''+4 dagger'' with the ''ghost touch'' quality.{{Cite dragon/330/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Tools of the Assassin|68}}",
        "Trivia": "* The followers of certain deities &mdash; [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], [[Jergal]], [[Luthic]], [[Osiris]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]] &mdash; would receive a ''+1 ghost touch'' enchantment from casting the spell ''[[weapon of the deity]] ''and holding that deity's [[favored weapon]]. These weapons were a dagger, [[scythe]], [[claw bracer]],  [[flail]], and quarterstaff respectively.\n* Bows, arrows, and bolts fashioned from the wood of one of [[Arvandor]]'s serren trees naturally had the ''ghost touch'' quality.<ref>\n* ''[[Ghost gauntlet]]s'' temporarily imbued the ''ghost touch'' quality to any weapon that was wielded with them.<ref>\n* [[Spirit shaman]]s were capable of conferring this quality upon any weapon so long as they wielded it."
