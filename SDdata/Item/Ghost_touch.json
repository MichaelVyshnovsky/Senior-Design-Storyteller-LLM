        "mainbody": "Ghost touch was both an armor quality and a weapon quality that could be added to any weapon or armor to make it effective against incorporeal creatures.\nAny armor, shield, or weapon that possessed this quality was both corporeal and incorporeal simultaneously. This made armor more protective against incorporeal creatures, such as ghosts, and made weapons capable of harming them normally as though they were enchanted. However, this effect would not pass on to the ammunition fired by ranged weapons, such as arrows and bullets.\nAs items with this quality were considered incorporeal, such creatures were likewise capable of wielding them. Items with this quality were also able to pass through solid objects if the wielder desired.\nThe creator must use either the spell Ghost touch armor or ghost touch weapon when crafting the appropriate item to add this property.\nBesides armor and weapons, this quality could be applied to rings, rods, staffs, wands, and wondrous items.\nSome experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as ghost touch weapons. \n* Afterthought, a +5 dagger with the ghost touch quality that was the personal weapon of the god of death Vecna.\n* Arumdina, a +5 battleaxe with the ghost touch quality that was the personal weapon of the gnome deity of luck  Garl Glittergold.\n* Dawnspeaker, a heavy mace with the ghost touch quality  that was the personal weapon of the deity Lathander.\n* Ethereal action,  a smooth wooden quarterstaff adorned with three silver bands and enchanted with +1 ghost touch.\n* Gungnir, a +5 shortspear with the ghost touch quality  that was the personal weapon of the interloper deity Odin.\n* Fatal Touch, a bastard sword with the ghost touch quality  that was the personal weapon of the death god Kelemvor.\n* The interloper goddess Hecate possessed +5 dagger with the ghost touch quality.\n* The interloper god Ptah possessed a +5 heavy mace with the ghost touch quality.\n* The goddess Lolth possessed both a dagger and whip with the ghost touch quality.\n* Nightbreaker, a +1 heavy mace with the ghost touch and disruption qualities that was sacred to the Church of Lathander.\n* Staff of ethereal action, an enchanted quarterstaff.\n* Wraithblade, an enchanted +4 dagger with the ghost touch quality.\n* The followers of certain deities &mdash Baravar Cloakshadow, Jergal, Luthic, Osiris, and Sehanine Moonbow &mdash would receive a +1 ghost touch enchantment from casting the spell weapon of the deity and holding that deitys favored weapon. These weapons were a dagger, scythe, claw bracer,  flail, and quarterstaff respectively.\n* Bows, arrows, and bolts fashioned from the wood of one of Arvandors serren trees naturally had the ghost touch quality.\n* Ghost gauntlets temporarily imbued the ghost touch quality to any weapon that was wielded with them.\n* Spirit shamans were capable of conferring this quality upon any weapon so long as they wielded it."
