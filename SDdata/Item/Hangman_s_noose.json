        "Description": "Halruaa was home to several types of sweet breads beloved by locals. One such sweet treat was called hangman's noose for its district shape of a braided pastry ending in a loop on the bottom. The sweet dough was shaped and fried in hot bubbling fat, growing plump and crunchy. When cooked, the nooses were left to dry on wooden T-shaped racks. When ready to serve, hangman's nooses were generously dusted and rolled in powdered [[sugar]] and a mix of several rare local spices: [[allspice]], [[cardamom]], and [[mace (spice)|mace]].\n\nThe cauldrons of bubbling fat were ket hot with simple [[spell]]s, which made anything cooked in them unavailable to the nation's [[jordaini]] population, as they were forbidden from using anything magical."
