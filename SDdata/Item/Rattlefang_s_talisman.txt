Rattlefangs talisman was a primitive enchanted amulet that belonged to a gnoll tribe leader Rattlefang of the Wild Hills region, Delimbiyr Vale circa 1372 DR.
This talisman was nothing but a simple chain with several bones from various creatures with chunks of dried flesh still attached.
Rattlefang imbued his talisman with the power to cast a dreadful disease on his enemies. The wearer was able to use the contagion spell once per day.
Circa 1372 DR, the talisman, along with its original owner, shaman Rattlefang, could be found in the Wild Hills, several hours  of travel away from the city of Daggerford. During that time, Rattlefangs gnoll prime warred with the ogres led by Guruk Bonesnap. Each of the feuding groups sought for a way to slaughter each other in order to claim a natural bridge over a deadly chasm for themselves.
