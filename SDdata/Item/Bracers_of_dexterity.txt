Bracers of dexterity were enchanted bracers created to aid masters of martial arts of Kara-Tur.
Bracers of dexterity enhanced the wearers dexterity. These items came in many different enchantment power levels.
Sages and historians believed the bracers of dexterity originally came from the far eastern land of Kara-Tur. They were created to enhance the martial artists abilities, making them almost impossible to strike. These magical bracers were first mentioned in historical recordings of the visit of far-eastern travelers to the sword coast, even though though sages thought these records unreliable.

*Oleff Uskar on the Halls of Justice in Neverwinter circa 1372 DR.
*Ophala Cheldarstorn owed a pair of bracers of dexterity of the +3 enchantment.
