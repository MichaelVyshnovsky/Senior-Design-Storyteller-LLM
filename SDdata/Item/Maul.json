        "mainbody": "A maul (or mall) was a heavy, long-handled hammer.\nOn one side of it a maul was similar to a warhammer, while the other side similar to an axe. A typical maul built for wood splitting and would have an overall length comparable to a greataxe.\nMauls had wedge-shaped heads and a cutting side resembling an axe, though with a thicker, blunter blade. For splitting wood, this tool was considered much better than a typical axe. Their weight was more advantageous and due to their width, it was difficult for them to become stuck in the wood. When used in combat, this heavy weapon was wielded in two hands.\nMauls were known to be favored by dwarves.\n* Great Mallet of Silvanus, preferred weapon of the nature god Silvanus.\n* Maul of Brutal Endings, preferred weapon of the demon lord, Kostchtchie."
