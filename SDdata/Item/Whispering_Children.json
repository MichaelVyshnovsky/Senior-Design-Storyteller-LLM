        "mainbody": "The Whispering Children were twenty-two powerful artifacts in the form of portraits. In reality, they were the transformed demipower children of the god Oghma. The paintings were referred to as Whispering Children because they whispered secrets to those nearby.\nShortly after ascending to godhood, Oghma fathered many demipower children. A few of his children decided to each specialize in an area of knowledge of their choosing. But twenty-two of the children were turned away from Oghma by Cyric, who transformed them into paintings. The goddess Mystra attempted to take the paintings from Cyric but he scattered the paintings across Faer√ªn and most were lost. Lord Kasdrian Norjah of the noble House Norjah of Airspur managed to collect seven of the Whispering Children by the late 15 century DR. The knowledge held by the Whispering Children was dangerous even to the gods, especially to Oghma.\n* The Necromancer This painting was composed of many disturbing scenes that, when combined, created a face.. It knew many secrets of necromancy and could even cast spells.\n*The Thief This painting knew many secrets relating to rogues."
