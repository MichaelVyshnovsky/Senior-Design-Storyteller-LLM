'''''Gloves of ice''''' were [[enchanted]] hand-coverings suffused with the power of [[elemental ice]].

==Description==
The ''gloves'' were permanently encrusted with ice. Their wearer did not need to worry about this ice freezing their own hands.

==Powers==
While wearing the ''gloves of ice'', an individual could invoke their power either to enhance their attacks with the power of [[cold]], or to have their blows ignore some of a foe's resistance to the cold.

The ''gloves'' could be used as a [[spell focus]] in an ancient [[Nar]] [[ritual]] to infuse an individual with [[primal magic]], turning them into a literal force of nature. This ritual required several [[magic items]] as foci, also including a ''[[cloak of translocation]]'', a ''[[versatile spellbook]]'', and a ''[[circlet of mental onslaught]]''.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Black Card|17-19}}

==Notable Owners==
* [[Iyraclea]], the Ice Queen, left a pair of ''gloves of ice'' entombed alongside her ''[[iceborn]]'' clone in a vault beneath the [[Delhalls]] in [[Vaasa]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|26}}
* [[Kelog]], an ancient Nar [[wizard]] whose [[spirit]] inhabited a ruined keep in the [[Dunwood]] through the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* The [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke of Daggerford]] as of [[1479 DR]],{{4e-time}} who held a pair to give as rewards to [[adventurer]]s.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Gilding a Noble|34}}
