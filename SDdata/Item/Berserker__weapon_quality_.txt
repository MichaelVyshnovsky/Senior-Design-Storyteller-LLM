'''Berserker''' was a [[weapon quality|quality]] that increased the [[Item enchantment|enchantment level]] of a [[weapon]] wielded by someone in a rage. They proved quite useful to [[barbarian]]s and as expected [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserkers]].

==Crafting==
Weapons with this quality were crafted by the ''[[vremyonni]]'' of Rashemen. The [[spell]]s involved crafting a ''berserker weapon'' were either ''[[divine power]]'', ''[[rage]]'', or ''[[emotion]]''.
