        "History": {
            "History on Toril": "On Toril, firearms had never been extensively (or even adequately) researched and developed prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], save for a few eccentric [[wizard]]s. None of the major nations or organizations on the planet invested the time or money into producing firearms on a large scale. Not even the ancient [[Netheril|Netherese empire]] had the most basic of firearms, the arquebus.<ref>\n\nIn [[1246 DR]], the first recorded use of bombards by the island nation of [[Lantan]] occurred.<ref><ref> These bombards utilized gunpowder, as the deity [[Gond]] had yet to render the substance inert{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-08 - When Gunpowder Went Inert}} out of concern for his worshipers' safety.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}}\n\nEverything changed during the [[Time of Troubles]], when Gond in his mortal [[avatar]] form washed up on the shore of Lantan. In return for the people there sheltering him, in [[1358 DR]] he revealed to the Lantanna how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder, such as the arquebus and its variations.\n\nIn the first three years that followed, arquebuses were introduced to the wider Realms. During these years they were viewed primarily as curios. Some tried to produce their own firearms, but they were inferior to those made by the Lantanna. The Realms also experienced a slow influx of arquebuses overtime from spelljamming sources.<ref>\n\nFrom the third to fifth year of their existence, arquebuses and their variants became more common. Well-stocked weapon shops began to carry them, those who wielded them were no longer looked at strangely, and their price dropped significantly. From the fifth year onwards it was possible to find firearms in large stores.\n\n[[Felogyr Sonshal]] slowly became a major reseller for Lantan, distributing their firearms across the [[Sword Coast]]. But he carefully controlled his stock, ensuring that merchant families and [[thieves' guild]]s could not amass large amounts.<ref>\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], firearms were available throughout [[Faerûn]]. Around that time many of Gond's clerics supported themselves financially by selling ammunition for smokepowder weapons.<ref> Many rulers at this time viewed the [[Church of Gond]] with ire for having introduced firearms to the continent, seeing the weapons as a threat to their authority.<ref>\n\nAround this time, following the Lantanna pirate [[Gimlet Watersprecht]]'s creation of a ''[[portal]]'' between Lantan and the [[Pirate Isles]], there was a frightening rise in the number of smokepower and smokepowder weapons among pirates in the [[Inner Sea]]. This posed a great concern to the kingdom of Cormyr's then-princess and regent, [[Alusair Obarskyr]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of Lantan:Lantan to Pirate Isle}}\n\nIn the late-15{{th}} century DR, following the [[Second Sundering]] returning it from the parallel-world of [[Abeir]], the island nation of Lantan became more secretive. From the occasional glimpses that outsiders got of the Lantanna, they got the impression that their technology had become more advanced in the time since their absence. This in turn lead some to speculate about what developments the Lantanna may have made in regards to smokepowder weapons."
