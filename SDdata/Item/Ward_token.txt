'''''Ward tokens''''' were small objects with [[magic]]al properties used to bypass magical wards and traps and gain access to secure areas.

==Description==
''Ward tokens'' usually had a single rune or symbol inscribed into them.

==History==
[[Durlag Trollkiller]] created various ''ward tokens'' as a means of navigating his dangerous, trap-filled home, [[Durlag's Tower]]. Due to the adventuring popularity of the tower, many fake ''ward tokens'' were created by merchants to sell to [[adventurer]]s. A few of the original ''ward tokens'' were in circulation, but they were indistinguishable from the genuine ones.
