Rings of the Aquatic Elves were magical defensive items created out of coral by the sea elves.
Rings of the Aquatic Elves appeared to be corals smoothed and pressed into a ring shape.
These rings were used by the sea elves to grant them magical protection instead of wearing heavy armor underwater. The enchanted coral jewelry was used by aquatic elves both in war and everyday life.
After the Wailing Death of 1372 DR these rings could be found in the places along the Sword Coast and islands of the Sea of Swords frequented by pirates and sailors.
