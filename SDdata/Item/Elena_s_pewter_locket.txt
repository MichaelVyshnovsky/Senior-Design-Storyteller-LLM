Elenas pewter locket was a delicately crafted magical pendant that belonged to Elena who haunted Turgilds Square underneath Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.
Elenas pewter locket was a magical amulet that possessed the enchantment that increased the wearers wisdom and intelligence.
At some point before the couples death around the Weeping War in 714 DR, Elena gifted the magical pewter locket to her beloved Garras. At some point, the locket was removed from his body, disturbing his final resting place by the creatures or invaders of the ruins.
At some point in 1369 DR, Elenas pewter locket was recovered from the ruins by either the adventurers sent to stop the Cult of the Dragon, or halfling thief and trader Nottle.
