A nevertoken was an enchanted item developed as trading tokens for Halruaan families before later being adopted as badges of recognition carried by members of the Soft Claws, given to them by the dragon Zundaerazylym.
Zundaerazylyms nevertokens were identical, smooth, glossy, silver-blue metal stars with four blunted points, about  thick and  across. They were relatively light. They had a tiny hole in the center to allow a chain or strap to be tied around them. They were made of some unknown durable alloy. When they broke, they usually burst into flames and crumbled to dust within seconds. They produced a pleasant sound and a particular chord when struck, which was one way to identify whether they were authentic.
Their powers functioned when they were held in ones bare hand and willed into action, but one must already know what their powers were. Known powers included
* Drawmijs instant summons
* elsewhere
* feather fall
* invisibility
* mending
* mind blank
* neverturn
* pass without trace
* sending
* silence
* sovereign succor
* teleport without error
* trace nevertoken
Their origins were unknown, and creating new ones would probably require extensive experimentation. They were previously Halruaan family trading tokens, and many early Halruaan families owned similar items, though newer families did not. Zundaerazylym was given a cache of more than a hundred of them in  by Ensible Mritavvalan, the dying last member of their family.
