Cream cheese was a type of soft, spreadable dairy product, similar to yak butter but less delicate and more plainly-tasting.
Cream cheese could be found in the Vast and used in pastry-making in the Downunda Patisserie of Ravens Bluff. The bakery sold cream cheese rolls with blueberry centers for four silvers per half a dozen.
Elminster Aumar favored certain exotic Earth foods and partook in these treats during his visits to that world. Cream cheese-filled poppers were among the Old Sages favorites.
