'''Cream cheese''' was a type of soft, spreadable dairy product, similar to [[yak butter]] but less delicate and more plainly-tasting.

==Availability==
Cream cheese could be found in [[the Vast]] and used in pastry-making in the [[Downunda Patisserie]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. The bakery sold cream cheese rolls with [[blueberry]] centers for four [[silver]]s per half a dozen.

[[Elminster Aumar]] favored certain exotic [[Earth]] foods and partook in these treats during his visits to that world. Cream cheese-filled poppers were among the Old Sage's favorites.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
