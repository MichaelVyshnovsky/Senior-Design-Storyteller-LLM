'''''Belt of Raumathar''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] item uncovered in the [[Ring of Gray Flames]] of the [[Endless Wastes]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
This belt fortified the wearer's abilities to wield [[arcane]] magics by giving them superior focus in handling [[evocation]] spells and granting the skill to weave penetrating spells. Additionally, the ''belt of Raumathar'' allowed the wearer to cast several powerful versions of the spells ''[[fireburst]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[prismatic spray]]'', and ''[[sunburst]]'' once per day, while the ''magic missile'' spell could be slung thrice per day.

==History==
It was unknown if the ''belt of Raumathar'' was a unique item, but one such waistband was recovered from the ruins known as the Ring of Gray Flames in the Endless Wastes sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. The name of [[Raumathar]] being given to the belt was scholarly speculation on its unknown origins; however, magics weaved into the belt suggested it was in use by Raumathari evokers. As the ''belt of Raumathar'' granted the wearer abilities that a [[Raumathari battlemage]] already could harness with ease, sages speculated that it belonged to an ally or a friend of a Raumathari battlemage.

In [[1374 DR]], the ''belt of Raumathar'' was worn by a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard of Thay]], [[Khai Khmun]], during his confrontation with the [[Kalach-Cha]] and [[Safiya]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]] echo of [[Mulsantir]].
