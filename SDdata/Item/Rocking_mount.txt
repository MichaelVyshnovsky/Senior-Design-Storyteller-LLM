A '''rocking mount''',{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}} also commonly known as a '''rocking horse''',<ref>{{ Cite book/Knight of the Living Dead|15,30,76,88}} was a wooden child's toy made to resemble some form of [[mount]] and braced upon two curved bands similar to those of a [[rocking chair]].

==Description==
Crafted from wood, these toys could be crafted to resemble a variety of different mounts, though most commonly resembled [[horse]]s.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold rocking mounts imported from [[Cormyr]] that they advertised as being perfect for "practicing knight-errants". These came in a wide variety of styles, ranging from the mundane horse (destrier) to [[pegasi]] and [[unicorn]]s, to more strange mounts such as [[sea lion]]s or various colors of [[dragon]]s. All were sold at the same bargain price of 4 [[gold piece]]s.
* The [[Toysmiths]], a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the [[gnome]] brothers [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] and [[Relvan Gaewilder]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|7}} sold rocking mounts in many of the same styles as ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue''. However, the brothers charged different prices for each style of mount. Standard horses were the cheapest at 3 gp, pegasi and unicorns sold for 4 gp, sea lions for 5 gp, and dragon styled rocking mounts for 8 gp. Additionally, Toysmiths offered rocking mounts styled to resemble [[griffin]]s at a cost of 4 gp.

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Cassalanter]] family owned and kept a rocking mount shaped like a [[warhorse]] within their [[Cassalanter villa|villa]]'s playroom in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* The treasure hoard of [[Guh]] inside [[Grudd Haug]] included a rocking horse with [[silver]] inlays and [[blue quartz]]es for eyes.
* The [[Martikov]] family, operators of the [[Wizard of Wines]] in [[Barovia]], owned a rocking horse that was painted to resemble a [[nightmare]].
* The [[Shadowdusk]] family owned a rocking horse, that at one point had been partially scorched by fire, and kept it within their family's vault of treasures.
* [[Skabatha Nightshade]] owned a rocking horse she flew upon. But rather than being crafted from wood, her rocking horse was a unicorn named [[Elidon]] that had been transformed into that form by the [[Hourglass Coven]] and its horn removed.
