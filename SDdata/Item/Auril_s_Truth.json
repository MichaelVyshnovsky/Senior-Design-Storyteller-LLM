        "mainbody": "'''''Auril's Truth''''' was a set of [[enchanted]] [[priest]]ly vestments worn by some [[Aurilian]] clergy.",
        "Powers": "These icy-white colored [[robe]]s were imbued with [[magic]] that protected the wearer from cold. Additionally, ''Auril's Truth'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[cone of cold]]'' (expended two charges) and ''[[polar ray]]'' (consumed five charges) [[spell]]s. A typical set of robes could hold up to thirty charges.",
        "History": "''Auril's Truth'' was easily recognizable for its bright white color and blue trim. These robes were rarely seen in the hands of anyone but the clergy of the Frostmaiden. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a set of ''Auril's Truth'' could be purchased from [[Mintassan's Mysteries]]â€“a shop filled with exotic magical curios from across [[Toril]]."
