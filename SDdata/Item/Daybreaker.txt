The '''''Daybreaker''''' was an [[enchanted]] two-handed bludgeon, used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] in [[northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Powers==
The ''Daybreaker'' was [[enchanted]] with [[divine]] magics to be deadly to the [[undead]]. The weapon became effectively an enchanted ''+4'' morningstar when used against undead creatures. In addition to that, it dealt additional [[radiant]] damage to its foes.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the ''Daybreaker'' was said to be located somewhere in the city of [[Neverwinter]], possibly in the hands of [[Dazuur]] and its undead horde in the ruins of [[Illefarn]], or hidden in the hoard of the [[dragon]]s who terrorized the [[Dragon's Roost]] in the [[Sword Mountains]].
