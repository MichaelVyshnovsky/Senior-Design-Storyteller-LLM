        "mainbody": "The Bulwark of the Great Dragon was a unique enchanted tower shield created out of bones and scaled of an ancient dragon by Darson sometime before 1372 DR.\nThe shield possessed potent defensive +6 enchantments and allowed the wielder to expel fire dragons breath three times per day.\nThe shields creator, Darson, bragged about killing the ancient dragon himself, using its body to create the Bulwark of the Great Dragon. Such an outlandish claim was believed by very few, however. Most believed that the blacksmith simply came across a body of a slain wyrm and salvaged materials for the enchanted tower shield.\nBy 1373 DR, the Bulwark of the Great Dragon found its way to Hillsfar of the Moonsea region."
