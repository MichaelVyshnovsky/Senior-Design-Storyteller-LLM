A potion of flying was a very rare potion that gave its imbiber the ability to fly.
The liquid in potions of flying was transparent and floated at the top of the container. These potions also had cloudy white impurities drifting in the contained liquid.
When these potions were consumed, the imbibers could fly as fast as they could usually walk, for an hour. If the users were in the air when the effect of the potion expired, they would fall to the ground, potentially taking damage.
The whiskers of sakinas could be used to make such potions. Another recipe for potion of flying called for a sublimate of eagle feathers.
