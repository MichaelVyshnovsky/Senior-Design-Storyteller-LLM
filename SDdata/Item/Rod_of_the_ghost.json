An average rod of the ghost held three charges and could be used once per day.\nRods of the ghost gained popularity in the Sword Coast region in the late 14 century DR. One such rod of ancient making could be found in Telarthirs tomb of the Brush of Barbs in 1372 DR. In the , a magical curio store â€“ Mintassans Mysteries of Westgate, was in possession of one of these rods."
