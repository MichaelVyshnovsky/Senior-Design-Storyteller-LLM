A '''cestus''' {{Pl|cesti}} weas a type of offensive [[gauntlet]] found in the Realms, primarily known for being used by [[gladiator]]s.

==Description==
These gauntlets were typically made of [[leather]], with spikes and razor edges on the back and across the knuckles. These kept the wielders' knuckles from splitting in addition to making their punches more damaging.<ref>
