A cestus  weas a type of offensive gauntlet found in the Realms, primarily known for being used by gladiators.
These gauntlets were typically made of leather, with spikes and razor edges on the back and across the knuckles. These kept the wielders knuckles from splitting in addition to making their punches more damaging.
Some cestuses were also loaded with lead or other heavy filler to give punches more force.
* The avatars of Bahgtru typically fought with cesti studded with steel rivets.
* Kellack "Killer" Ironfist was a shield dwarf gladiator of Hillsfar, so named for his use of a cestus made of black iron.
* In the Domains of Dread, some criminals were known to fight with cestuses.
