        "mainbody": "Bluestars was a perfume that activated its scent when applied to a humanoids skin.\nBluestars was a clear blue liquid with floating golden flecks and a strong medicinal smell. On application to the skin of a humanoid, it changed to a pleasant scent of fresh before-storm winds, and its color turned clear. An exception was its effect on orcs, whereupon it took on the smell of freshly-baked bread. Its application instantly removed all unpleasant bodily aromas and strong smells like curry or garlic, and lasted for about a day.\nThe high price of 220 gp per pint was not only due to its odor-banishing properties, but the common false belief that it protected the wearer from poisons.\nIt was rumored that bluestars was concocted out of forest dew that saw starlight, the tears of a virgin, and a distillate of a unicorns alicorn. In truth, its recipe included powdered shells of a certain species of snail, a special type of clay, and sap from three common weeds."
