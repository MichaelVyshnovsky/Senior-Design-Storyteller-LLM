        "mainbody": "'''Bluestars''' was a [[perfume]] that activated its scent when applied to a [[humanoid]]s skin.",
        "Description": "Bluestars was a clear blue liquid with floating golden flecks and a strong medicinal smell. On application to the skin of a [[humanoid]], it changed to a pleasant scent of fresh before-storm winds, and its color turned clear. An exception was its effect on [[orc]]s, whereupon it took on the smell of freshly-baked [[bread]]. Its application instantly removed all unpleasant bodily aromas and strong smells like [[curry]] or [[garlic]], and lasted for about a day.\n\nThe high price of 220 [[gp]] per pint was not only due to its odor-banishing properties, but the common false belief that it protected the wearer from [[poison]]s.\n\nIt was rumored that bluestars was concocted out of forest dew that saw starlight, the tears of a virgin, and a distillate of a [[unicorn]]'s ''[[alicorn]]''. In truth, its recipe included powdered shells of a certain species of [[snail]], a special type of [[clay]], and sap from three common weeds."
