        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the eating utensil|the maritime strait|the Spoon}}\n'''Spoons''' were a kind of utensil used in cooking and eating, widely appreciated for their scooping and stirring qualities.",
        "Description": "The average spoon was used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside [[fork]]s and [[knives]]. They were also a standard part of [[mess kit]]s used by travelers. Their most important feature was the [[bowl]]-like protuberance that allowed them to scoop up liquid foods like [[soup]] and [[porridge]]. Cheap dining spoons were commonly made from [[brass]], while fancier ones were crafted from [[silver]]. Spoons used in cooking were often made of wood. \n\n[[Spade]]s and [[shovel]]s were essentially massive spoons used for farming, mining, and other labor-intensive work. [[Ladle]]s were more modest, resembling oversized spoons used to prepare and serve food.",
        "Usage": {
            "Magic": "* ''[[Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion]]'' required a silver spoon."
        },
        "Notable Spoons": "* ''[[Murlynd's spoon]]'', a magical spoon that produced [[gruel]].\n* One of the known types of ''[[Quaal's feather token]]s'' was a spoon.\n* ''[[Utensils of the cultured palate]]'', magical sets of eating utensils that always included a spoon."
