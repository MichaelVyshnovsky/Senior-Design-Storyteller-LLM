        "mainbody": "Spoons were a kind of utensil used in cooking and eating, widely appreciated for their scooping and stirring qualities.\nThe average spoon was used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside forks and knives. They were also a standard part of mess kits used by travelers. Their most important feature was the bowl-like protuberance that allowed them to scoop up liquid foods like soup and porridge. Cheap dining spoons were commonly made from brass, while fancier ones were crafted from silver. Spoons used in cooking were often made of wood. \nSpades and shovels were essentially massive spoons used for farming, mining, and other labor-intensive work. Ladles were more modest, resembling oversized spoons used to prepare and serve food.\n* Mordenkainens magnificent mansion required a silver spoon.\n* Murlynds spoon, a magical spoon that produced gruel.\n* One of the known types of Quaals feather tokens was a spoon.\n* Utensils of the cultured palate, magical sets of eating utensils that always included a spoon."
