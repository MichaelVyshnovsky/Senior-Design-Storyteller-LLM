It was imported to western Faerûn by travelers from those lands.\nThis bold yellow stone was a form of corundum making it harder than regular topaz and able to make fine gems.\nThis gem stone recalled the fiery yellow of some cats eyes and was used in the construction of magic items associated with felines. Rumor gave it many magical properties but what they might have been has not yet been documented."
