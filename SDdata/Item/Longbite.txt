Longbite, originally called the Gentle Rain, was an enchanted greatsword forged by one of the apprenticed of a famous elven smith Quilin sometime before 1372 DR.
Longbite was a deadly blade with a +2 enchantment and a magically enhanced keen edge that could easily decapitate a giant and cause opponents flee in fear.
The blade named the Gentle Rain was created to be a lesser cousin of an infamous enchanted greatsword - the Veiled Tears. The weapon was forged by one of the apprentices of virtuoso smith Quilin for mistress Lissial. The sward was renamed to Longbite after it was wielded by Lissial against a hill giant ambush. The woman knew she was outmatched and charged at the giant leader. With one mighty swing, she decapitated the bandit while the rest of hill giants fled in terror.
By 1372 DR, Longbite ended up in the scaly hands of lizardfolk of the Lizard Marsh. The greatsword could be found in the hut of Saslick, a leader of one of the lizard tribes of the Marsh.
