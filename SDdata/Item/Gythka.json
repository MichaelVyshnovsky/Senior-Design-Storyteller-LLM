        "mainbody": "A gythka was a type of exotic weapon invented by the thri-kreen and unique to them.\nIt was a long, two-handed polearm with a crescent-shaped blade mounted on each end. These dealt deep slashing wounds. A highly trained warrior could fight with both ends at once. It could also be hurled as a spear. It was much more familiar to the thri-kreen, who, with four arms, could wield two gythkas simultaneously.\nCollectors would buy these weapons if they were in good condition.\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryMelee weapons\nCategorySlashing weapons\nCategoryExotic weapons\nCategoryTwo-handed weapons\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems\nazdshj0yqns8v0yt0b2lk4avmkmpsh5"
