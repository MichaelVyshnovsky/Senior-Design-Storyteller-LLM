A shield of lightning protection was an enchanted tower shield used to repel lightning.
These blue tower shields were used by underground dwellers to combat all sources of lightning. In particular, shields of lightning warded against lightning bolt spells, as well as lightning spell traps. Such shields were found in dwarf settlements above Menzoberranzan, such as in the Temple of Dumathoin.
