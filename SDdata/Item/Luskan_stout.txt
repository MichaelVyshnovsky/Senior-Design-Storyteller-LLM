Luskan stout was a dark malty brew from the city of Luskan. This stout was so thick it could be considered an entire meal in one tankard.
Luskan stout possessed some energizing and invigorating qualities.
In 1281 DR, Luskan stout was imported into the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and was served by Grisella at her establishment - the Winters Cradle Tavern of Easthaven
In the mid-to-late-15 century DR, Luskan stout was available in the city of Neverwinter, notably, at the Beached Leviathan tavern.
