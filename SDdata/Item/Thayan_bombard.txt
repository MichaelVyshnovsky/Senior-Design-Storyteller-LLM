'''''Thayan bombards''''', also rendered as '''''Thayvian bombards''''', were mystical [[bombard]]s developed by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. but later occasionally put to use on naval vessels, these rare [[siege engine]]s were considered to be wonders of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Much like a standard bombard, these weapons were made from cast [[iron]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/11-29 - Waterdhavian Bombards and Boneballs}} with some describing the hulking immobile sentries as being larger than any manor house in the city of [[Waterdeep]].The [[Dungeon magazine]] adventure [[Dungeon magazine 66/Operation Manta Ray|"Operation Manta Ray"]] features Thayan bombards and states their dimensions on page 52. Though not stated in the text to be the "heavy" variant, the bombards in the adventure can be surmised as being such based on the targeting range given for them. The dimensions in the adventure for a "heavy Thayan bombard" are stated to be a length of {{SI|5|ft}} and a diameter of {{SI|5|ft}}, which are far smaller than being "larger than a Waterdhavian manor house". They required either winches or [[giant]]s in order to move them.

==Weaponology==
''Thayan bombards'' required a crew of four, though a particularly gifted bombardier could potentially operate one single-handedly.

The effective range of these weapons varied between their light and heavy variant. Light bombards had an effective range of {{SI|250|yard|long=yes}}, while heavy bombards had{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|52}}

Unlike standard bombards, ''Thayan bombards'' did not rely upon [[smokepowder]] and instead used their own mysterious powder, possibly their own variant on the substance.<ref group="note" name="powder">In ''[[Pirates of the Fallen Stars]]'' (1992) it stated that a contingent of Gondar clerics were working to "...determine whether the bombards can be used with Lantanna smoke powder, breaking Thay's monopoly on the precious powder used to fire these weapons." This could be interpreted to mean that ''Thayan bombards'' use their own proprietary powder instead of smokepowder. However, in the earlier published ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' (1990) they are stated to be smokepowder weapons. This discrepancy between sources could mean either that (1) the earlier source is mistaken, or (2) that the bombards operate on some sort of "Thayan smokepowder", which would explain the choice to specify that the Gondar clergy were trying to determine if they could use "Lantanna smokepowder". The exact nature of how the bombards functioned and their propulsion were both a mystery to those outside of the Red Wizards, mysteries that were compounded by magic the Red Wizards placed over them to further conceal these trade secrets.

===Ammunition===
In addition to the normal "stone shot" typically fired by bombards, ''Thayan bombards'' fired [[mage shot|magical bombs]]. The design of bomb used for much of the 14{{th}} century DR were large, hollow stone spheres, filled with a mysterious fluid. This fluid would ignite upon firing, becoming a blazing sphere of blue fire that exploded in a burst akin to a ''[[fireball]]''. However, these bombs could be inadvertently set off. Because of this precautions were often taken with storing them. According to some accounts, a single one of these "fire bombs" was powerful enough to sink a warship.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|39-40}}

Development of other types of magical bombs, ones that could produce a greater variety of dangerous or noxious [[spell]]-like effects, began in [[1349 DR]]. Experiments with these would be conducted for the next two decades, until finally they were deemed ready to be mass produced on the plateau of [[Thaymount]] (a place secure from outsiders), finally seeing widespread deployment in the early 1370's DR. These later bombs were thick spheres of glass, measuring {{SI|1|ft}} in diameter and weighing {{SI|20|lb|k|long=yes}}. Each bomb type had a distinct appearance, reflective of its effect. These effects were triggered and centered upon their point of impact, but for most bombs their effect would only activate if launched from a ''Thayan bombard''. Some of the most common bomb varieties included the following:
;Cloudkill bomb: A bomb that imitated the effects of the spell ''[[cloudkill]]'', though the noxious cloud created could not be moved. A bilious green liquid was visible within them. They had a market value of 1,125 gp.
;Death bomb: A bomb that imitated the effects of the spell ''[[circle of death]]''. These bombs had a black hue, were covered in sinister blue runes, and were cold to the touch. They had a market value of 1,650 gp.
;Fireball bomb: The most common of bombs, these imitated the effects of the spell ''fireball''. They were warm to the touch and emanated a dull red glow. They were available in three sizes, each having a higher intensity of damage than the last. The three variants of ''fireball bombs'' had market values of 375 gp, 450 gp, and 750 gp.
;Snowball swarm bomb: A bomb that imitated the effects of the spell ''[[Snilloc's snowball swarm]]''. These bombs had a blue hue and were covered in frost. They had a market value of 250 gp.
;Stinking cloud bomb: A bomb that imitated the effects of the spell ''[[stinking cloud]]''. A sickly yellow liquid was visible within these bombs. They had a market value of 375 gp.

==History==
Development on the ''Thayan bombard'' began after Thayan spies reported upon the testing of standard bombards that was being conducted on the island nation of [[Lantan]], the first recorded instance of which occurred in {{YearlinkName|1246}},<ref><ref> as the Red Wizards declared it was necessary for Thay to command such armaments themselves. The first experiments were conducted in [[1312 DR]]. These experiments were quite disastrous, shredding some poor Red Wizards into little bits. The first successful experiment would be achieved in the {{YearlinkName|1314}}.

The first offensive use of a ''Thayan bombard'' occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1316}}, against a group of living targets that Red Wizards had surrounded. This group was chosen as the Red Wizards were certain that they had no chance of escaping and it was considered critical that the weapon remained a secret.

In the {{YearlinkName|1349}}, development began on a new variety of ammunition, glass bombs that could mimic spell effects other than simply ''fireball''. Over the two decades that followed experiments would be conducted, first upon inanimate targets within Thay and later upon living targets along the nation's border with [[Mulhorand]], such as brigands.

Sometime long before [[1356 DR]],It is not known exactly when the pirates of the Pirate Isles obtained their ''Thayan bombards'', but all early sources repeat the fact that it happened "a long time ago". With the first ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' being our earliest source, it had to have occurred before the year 1356 DR. the pirates of the [[Pirate Isles]] somehow obtained eight ''Thayan bombards'',Nor is it known exactly how the pirates of the Pirate Isles got their hands on ''Thayan bombards'', considering that the Red Wizards are very defensive of their inventions. For example, on page 24 of ''[[Dreams of the Red Wizards]]'' one of the rules of the Red Wizards is stated to be that, "...no enchanted item that has military usefulness may be sold outside the country or to a representative of some power outside the country." making them the only entities outside of Thay to possess those wondrous weapons. On the [[Citadel of Immurk's Hold|Citadel]] of [[Immurk's Hold]] each of these bombards were sat atop a free turning base, marked with 360 degree marks, and had a hand-screw mechanism that allowed them to be elevated from 45 to 85 degree angles. The hold's pirates ran daily drills to ensure their teams of human signal flag wavers and [[ogre]] bombardiers were quite efficient.

However, this great defensive power for the Pirate Isles came at a great cost, for the ''Thayan bombards'' were reliant upon the fire-fluid  and precious powder needed to fire these weapons. The pirates purchased both from the [[tharchion]]ess of [[Bezantur]], [[Mari Agneh]],<ref> who parted with both precious substances at a high price. Around [[1359 DR]], a small contingent of [[Gondar]] [[cleric]]s were on Dragonisle, working with the pirates to discover if it was possible for the bombards to utilize [[Lantan]]na's smokepowder in place of the secret powder the bombards were designed to use. This was all done in secrecy, for the Thayans highly valued the monopoly they had on the substances needed to use their bombards and would consider the pirates to be enemies if they were to find out about this treachery.

Up until the 1360's DR, This was due to a combination of their extreme value, the great effort that was required to transport them, and the Red Wizards' desire to keep them a secret. The ''Thayan bombard'' would finally see battlefield usage in the 1360's DR,

Within Thay itself, dozens of ''Thayan bombards'' were stationed on the island tharch of [[Alaor]], which housed the nation's main naval base as well as extensive shipbuilding and repair facilities.{{Cite web/theedverse/2016-10-25 - 15th Century Update on Status of Cannons}} the Thayans managed to circumvent this by specially designing ships that could handle them.

The first such ship was the ''[[Red Scourge]]'', an impressive warship constructed of enameled red iron and magic. It was outfitted with twenty four light bombards, twelve on each side. A Red Wizard was required to be stationed on the ship at all times in order to supervise the use of the bombards and command their bombardiers. For the sake of safety, the ship's five hundred bombs were kept within iron lockers that were enspelled with an effect equivalent to a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''. The ''Red Scourge'' continued to be in action by 1372 DR, but by then the Thayan navy had expanded, developing over a dozen [[dromond]]s that were each capable of being outfitted with a pair of light ''Thayan bombards''.
