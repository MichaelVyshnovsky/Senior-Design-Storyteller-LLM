Glittering necklaces came in various designs and different light colors. They were decorated with dull gray stones that glowed with illusory inner light with a  radius. The necklace remained cold to the touch when activated.
In the late 14 century DR, glittering necklaces were a common commodity, found in inventories of many traders, wizards, rogues, and temples.
