Glittering necklaces were common enchanted amulets imbued with illusion magic.
Glittering necklaces came in various designs and different light colors. They were decorated with dull gray stones that glowed with illusory inner light with a  radius. The necklace remained cold to the touch when activated.
In the late 14 century DR, glittering necklaces were a common commodity, found in inventories of many traders, wizards, rogues, and temples.
