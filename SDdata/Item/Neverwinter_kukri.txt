Neverwinter kukri were enchanted exotic blades commissioned by Calimshan Businessmans Embassy in Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.
Neverwinter kukri possessed a +2 enchantment that enhanced their damage output and guided the wielders hand towards the target. Additionally, these weapons improved the wielders fortitude.
These magic blades were a local variant of kukri found in the city of Neverwinter. They were ordered by Calimshan Businessmans Embassy especially to be gifted to individuals who culturally represented the nation of Calimshan in the north. By the late 14 century DR, some of these blades ended up on black markets and were sometimes available for purchase from dealers of magic arms and armor.
