        "mainbody": "'''''Montolio's cloak''''' was a [[magic]]al cloak that was named after and worn by the [[Mielikki]]an ranger [[Montolio Debrouchee]].",
        "Description": "The garment comprised a short-length cloak that was fastened by a unique clasp. If the two pieces were seperated, ''Montolio's cloak'' temporarily lost the [[Item enchantment|magical enchantments]] it held.",
        "Powers": "In addition to bolstering the inherent mental and physical defenses of its wearer, the cloak conveyed upon them some of the fighting skill that was possessed by its namesake: it allowed them to fight more effectively while wielding a weapon in either hand.",
        "History": "In the decades after Montolio's death, the cloak and brooch were separated from one another and scattered across the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. \n\nAt some point before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Montolio's cloak'' came into the possession of the [[mage]] [[Omar Harad]], while the clasp was lost deep within the fortress of [[Watcher's Keep]] in [[Tethyr]]."
