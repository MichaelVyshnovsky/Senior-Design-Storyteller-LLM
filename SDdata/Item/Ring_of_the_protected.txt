The ring of the protected was the unique enchanted ring that belonged to Magister Luther of Myth Drannor.
This ring was created out intricately of weaved together platinum bands.
The ring of the protected was imbued with enchantments that enhanced the wearers defense and improved their protections against many physical and magical effects.
Magister Luther was one of the ancient heroes interred within one of the crypts within the Elven Catacombs. In 1369 DR, the ring of the protected was still on its masters finger. His spirit, along with several other heroes in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the ring was ever removed from the sarcophagus, Luthers wraith was there to punish the grave-robbers.
