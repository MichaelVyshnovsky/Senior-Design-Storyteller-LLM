Cancerous bastard swords were somewhat more common enchanted blades that could spread magical diseases on their targets.
Cancerous bastard swords were masterfully crafted blades with faintly glowing blue arcane runes of power etched along their surfaces.
These blades were enchanted with morbid magic that had a fair chance of infecting the targets, upon a successful strike, with a dangerous disease that caused damage every two seconds until cured. Thus, a mere scrape by a cancerous bastard sword could prove deadly.
One such bastard sword belonged to Maiden Ilmadia, one of the lieutenants of a devil known as Belhifet in 1281 DR. She laired at the bottom of an ancient dwarven foundry of Dorns Deep on the Spine of the World. She controlled the fire giant and salamander forces of Belhifets monster army.
