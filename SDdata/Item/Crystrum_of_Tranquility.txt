The '''''Crystrum of Tranquility''''' was an object sacred to the [[Eldath|Eldathyn faith]].

==Description==
The ''Crystrum of Tranquility'' was a perfect sphere of unblemished, colorless crystal about 1 foot (30 centimeters) in diameter.

==Function==
In order to activate the power of the ''Crystrum'', the sphere had to be immersed in running water, the water of a natural pool, or [[holy water]] in a bowl of stone, wood, horn, or bone. While immersed, a priest or priestess of [[Eldath]] then had to touch or hold the object in silence for at least twenty minutes.

If done correctly, a glowing blue script would appear on the surface of the sphere, providing an alphabetical roster of spells. If the name of any spell was touched, the complete text would appear on the sphere. Alternatively, the priest touching the sphere could also will the text to appear on any nearby still surface of water.

If any living creature who did not worship Eldath touched the sphere, the writing would instantly disappear. If the sphere was still immersed, the writing could be restored by an act of will by a devout Eldathyn. Otherwise, the ritual would have to be repeated.

==Spells==
The spell texts contained within the ''Crystrum'' comprised the following: ''[[banish blight]]'', ''[[cloud of purification]]'', ''[[control vapor]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[detect snares and pits]]'', ''[[find the path]]'', ''[[free action]]'', ''[[heroes' feast]]'', ''[[hold animal]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'', ''[[invisibility to animals]]'', ''[[laughing water]]'', ''[[locate animals or plants]]'', ''[[locate object]]'', ''[[mist of the goddess]]'', ''[[moonbeam]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[rainbow]]'', ''[[reflecting pool]]'', ''[[reincarnation]]'', ''[[silence, 15' radius]]'', ''[[speak with monsters]]'', ''[[starshine]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[transport via plants]]'', ''[[tree]]'', ''[[water of Eldath]]'', and ''[[water walk]]''.

The Eldathyn believed, based on instruction provided by Eldath herself to the priest [[Lorth Blaenarry]], that a new spell would be added to the ''Crystrum'' whenever the sphere was brought to [[Elah'zad]], a Eldathyn holy site in [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]], by an Eldathyn in great need.

==Other Powers==
According to Lorth Blaenarry's book ''[[The Key to the Fastness]]'', the ''Crystrum'' could also ''[[purify food and drink]]'' with a touch, ''[[levitate]]'' when thrown or dropped, and emit a ''[[faerie fire]]'' effect, with a hue, intensity, and duration determined by its Keeper. The sphere moreover could not be shattered, altered, or cloaked by [[illusion]] magic.

==History==
According to Eldathyn teaching, the ''Crystrum'' was created by the goddess herself not long after the [[Weeping War|Fall of Myth Drannor]] and placed on an altar somewhere in the vicinity of the [[Elven Court]], where it rested undisturbed for more than two centuries.

The ''Crystrum'' is next described in the diaries of the [[ranger]] [[Eldrum the Silent]], who saw the object in the spring of [[989 DR]]. At that time, the sphere was in the possession of the Eldathyn priestess [[Analauthé Brenewood]], who, along with a company of other Eldathyn refugees, had fled monster attacks in [[Cormanthor]] and traveled across the [[Thunder Peaks]] into [[Hullack Forest]] in [[Cormyr]].

Analauthé later perished in a ritual to purify the [[Wyvernwater]] after the necromancer [[Elgarth]] of [[Westgate]] released a supernatural rot into the lake's waters. Custody of the sphere then passed into the hands of [[Shalgreth of the Wings]], so named because he crafted wings for himself and attempted to father a race of winged folk with a series of [[swanmay]] consorts.

Shalgreth eventually, in [[1112 DR]], granted the ''Crystrum'' to the ranger society known as the [[Men of the Green]], who later used the sphere in a confrontation with a [[beholder]] who had crafted a magical means of birthing forth other monstrosities in the manner of a [[deepspawn]]. The beholder was slain in the quest, known as the [[Hunt of the Beholder King]], but only one grievously wounded ranger survived the final battle. That ranger, [[Aulburne Mathtarke]], survived long enough to bring the ''Crystrum'' to [[Holyheart House]] in the [[Chondalwood]] before he finally succumbed to his injuries.

===The Life and Death of Lorth Blaenarry===
The Eldathyn enshrined the ''Crystrum'' at Holyheart House, keeping it hidden there even from other members of the faith, and set the priest [[Roathoald]] in charge of its care. After Roathoald's death in [[1148 DR]], a formal office of keeper of the ''Crystrum'' was established to keep the sphere secret and secure. But word of the sphere's power spread nonetheless, and on [[Mirtul 5]] in [[1271 DR]], Holyheart was attacked by members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]], accompanied by the [[dracoliches]] [[Goarulskul|Goarulskul the Black]] and [[Arlauthra Manytalons]]. Many Eldathyn were slain, but the young [[treetender]] Lorth Blaenarry managed to escape with the sphere.

Lorth reached [[Turmish]] with the ''Crystrum'', where in the streets of [[Alaghôn]] and [[Telpir]] he was hunted by [[Red Wizards of Thay]], who had recognized the power of the sphere. With the help of a [[Harper]] [[sorceress]], Lorth narrowly escaped the Red Wizards in the woods near [[Starmantle Bay]] and booked passage toward [[Zhentil Keep]]. Unfortunately, the [[Zhentarim]] were expecting a young man with a magical sphere, having obtained the information through the torture of a Thayan agent.

Lorth, however, was saved when he was instead abducted by Harper agents before he could fall into Zhentarim hands. The Harpers took Lorth to the [[Border Kingdoms]], where the group fell into a three-way battle with Zhentarim and Dragon Cultists for possession of the sphere. In order to save Lorth, the Harpers used a ''[[teleport]]'' spell to send Lorth on alone to Elah'zad in the desert of [[Anauroch]].

At Elah'zad, the goddess Eldath herself appeared to Lorth and instructed him in the use of the sphere, before magically transporting the young man to the city of [[Neverwinter]]. There, Lorth lived out the rest of his life serving Eldath and working to bring back the wilderness to places in the [[Sword Coast North]] that he felt had been too aggressively tamed by civilization. There, he also founded the [[Fastness of Green Shadows]], an Eldathyn temple, and wrote the book ''The Key to the Fastness''.

When Lorth perished in [[1336 DR]], a tree sprung from his body the next morning, and as his fellow Eldathyn knelt about him in prayer, the ''Crystrum'' rolled straight from the fallen Lorth to a young [[half-elf]] named [[Ilphiira Alonthar]].

===The Later History of the Sphere===
In the belief that she had been chosen by Eldath to bear the sphere, Ilphiira journeyed into the wilderness to seek the goddess's direction. Only a day after her departure, however, the Fastness of Green Shadows and much of the nearby forest was laid waste by the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], who believed the sphere still rested within the temple and hoped to obtain it.

Ilphiira herself fled eastward, following the [[River Dessarin]] toward the [[High Forest]] woodland governed by the [[treant]] [[Turlang]]. It is believed that she was ultimately headed toward [[Silverymoon]], but apart from a sighting of the half-elf by Harpers in [[Everlund]], the whereabouts of the last known Keeper of the sphere remain a mystery. An enigmatic vision sent by Eldath to [[Meirthond Arbreet]], Keeper of [[Fallen Trees Fastness]] in [[Amn]], suggested that Ilphiira set down the sphere in a place "where only the daring will find it" and promised great reward to any Eldathyn who recovered the ''Crystrum'' and brought it back to [[Elah'zad]]. None, however, had recovered the lost artifact by [[1370 DR]].

==Related Magical Items==
The ''Crystrum'' inspired the creation of a less potent magical item known as the [[Crystal Sphere of Singing Waters]]. When a flask of holy water was poured over the object, the crystal sphere would glow with ''[[faerie fire]]'' for twenty-four hours, during which time the user could cast ''[[purify food and drink]]'' at will and ''[[neutralize poison]]'' and ''[[scrying]]'' once each, using the sphere itself as the scrying focus.<ref>
