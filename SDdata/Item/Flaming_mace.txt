'''''Flaming maces''''' were [[enchanted]] bludgeons, used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] across [[northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Powers==
Their name was a straightforward description of their enchantments. The [[mace]]s' heads were surrounded by faint dancing wisps of flame and stronger variants had their heads smolder angrily with magical fire. These weapons possessed ''+1'' and ''+2'' enchantments that increased damage and guided the wielder's hand towards the targets.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, ''flaming maces'' were wielded by many heroes and bandits across the city of [[Neverwinter]]; the bandits and [[drow]] operatives of the [[Goblin Forest]]; by [[Aceros]], a [[zombie]] villain of [[Neverdeath]]; [[Red Wizard]]s of the [[Neverwinter Wood]]; and the [[vampire]] [[Lizet]] who laired in the ruins of [[Illefarn]] and also hidden in the hoard of the [[dragon]]s who terrorized the [[Dragon's Roost]] in the [[Sword Mountains]].
