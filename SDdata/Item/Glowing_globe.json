        "mainbody": "lowing globes were magic items that floated near the wielder and provided a source of light.\nThese globes always floated over the shoulder of the one who touched them. Their brightness was under the mental control of the wielder. A glowing globe would continue to follow one person until touched by someone else. A small percentage of these items were always illuminated regardless of the wielders desires.\nThese items were created by the wizard Nchaser, a native of Luskan."
