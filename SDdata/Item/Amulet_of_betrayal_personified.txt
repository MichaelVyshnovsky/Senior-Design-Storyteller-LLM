The amulet of betrayal personified was a powerful, yet cursed artifact that bestowed great powers upon its wearer.
As its name suggested, the amulets creation was linked an individual who betrayed those closest to them. Their very souls had to be consumed by the amulets crafter and molded together to form the artifact.
It emitted the horrible shrieks of the souls that were claimed in its creation
The wearer of the amulet of betrayal personified was granted tremendous power, both physical and mental. However they were left more susceptible to a variety of magical spells, or other effects that inflicted non-physical harm.
They gained immunity to negative energy but suffered tremendous damage from positive energy, along with magic and weapons that were divine in nature.
It was believed that the Kalach-Cha was capable of creating this amulet, though it was unknown if they actually went through with it.
