'''''Tiernon's sundered shield''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[shield]] found in the black peaks of [[Gloomfrost]] and restored by a blind [[duergar]] smith [[Tiernon Denthelm]] in [[1281 DR]].

==Descriotion==
When the shield was found, it had a huge dent from a [[frost giant]]'s fist. It bore the maker's mark of Tiernon and was decorated with an image of a dented helm. However, it was hard to tell if the image was dented by design or by the giant's punch that bent the shield.

After being restored, the shield faintly glowed and vibrated with power as if humming to itself.

==Powers==
When restored to its full power, ''Tiernon's sundered shield'' had a ''+3'' enchantment and granted its wielder partial resistance to physical harm. Additionally, the wielder could further increase one's resistance to physical attacks for ten minutes once per day and tap into the shield's magic to remove their fatigue.

==History==
Originally created by Tiernon Denthelm, the shield was smashed and its enchantments damaged in battle with a giant in the icy peak of Gloomfrost. In [[1281 DR]], the shield was brought to Tiernon to be restored. The smith "awoken" enchantments within its damaged shell by retracing runes that permeated its edges and re-created the Denthelm insignia.
