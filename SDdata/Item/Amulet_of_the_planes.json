        "mainbody": "An '''''amulet of the planes''''' was a [[magic]] amulet that allowed its wearer to travel between the [[plane]]s.",
        "Description": "''Amulets of the planes'' were typically circular necklace pendants, fashioned from gray metal and black stone and inscribed with various symbols. On closer inspection, they resembled a swirling mass of dark color, and gave off a strong [[conjuration]] aura.",
        "Powers": "A skilled wearer could use an ''amulet'' to cast ''[[plane shift]]'', transporting themselves and nearby creatures to a familiar location on another plane of existence. However, reckless or unfortunate use could send the wearer and their surroundings astray, even to entirely different planes altogether.",
        "Trivia": "* When used inside the legendary hut of [[Baba Yaga]], an ''amulet of the planes'' would only transport its wearer and nearby creatures to somewhere else within the hut.{{Cite dragon/83/The Dancing Hut|37}}\n* Prior to the [[Spellplague]], this amulet would not function while in the [[Demiplane of Dread]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Iggwilv]], the [[archfey]] patron of [[Prismeer]] in the [[Feywild]]."
