Rings of shield other were enchanted rings from Waterdeep, circa the late 15 century DR.
Simply named ring of shield other allowed the wearer to cast the shield other spell on the wearers allies. The version of the ring in Halbenets possession was imbued with a more powerful version of the spell that wrapped all of his allies in the protective magis of the item.
Ring of shield other was a gif from Laeral Silverhand to Halbenet sometime in the 15 century DR. She presented the moon elf with this piece of jewelry saying "a gift to share with friends", without revealing the rings potent magics. Halbenet never failed to brag about the enchanted item, insisting their friends admire Laerals generous gift.
