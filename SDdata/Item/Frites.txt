Frites or fries, sometimes called chips, was a simple potato dish found around the Western Heartlands as of the late 15 century DR.
Frites were thickly cut wedges of potato, that were fried in beef tallow. Sometimes, potatoes were doused in flavoring agents, such as garlic butter and lemon. Some people claimed that this dishs taste reminded them of "leisurely promenades along partially frozen rivers."
Fried potatoes were on the menu of the Wandering Emporium in Avernus in the late 15 century DR, seven as a side dish for fried merfolk fillets.
Frites were commonly seen in eateries and campfires across the Western Heartlands in West Faer√ªn, the city of Scornubel, as well as in the city of Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast. Fried potatoes were served doused in mustard sauce in Neverwinters The Board Laid Bare eatery. Further inland, fried potatoes were available in the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast. Frites were served with a morningfeast plates of steak and bacon aboard some ships that sailed out of Waterdeep, and in the Tethyrian city of Velen, pan-fried potatoes were served tossed in garlic, lemon, and oil.
