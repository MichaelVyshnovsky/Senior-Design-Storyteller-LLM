'''''Kyleena's silken armor''''' was a set of [[enchanted]] [[medium armor]] that belonged to [[Kyleena Moonglow]], a [[wild elf]] chieftain active ''circa'' [[1372 DR]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

==Description==
This set of armor was crafted out of pieces of polished tree bark and covered in a layer of tough [[spidersilk]] from nests of the [[spider]]s that nested in the highest [[Chult]]an tree canopies. The wood of the armor was black in color and decorated with intricate etching of spiderwebs.

==Powers==
''Kyleena's silken armor'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and made the wearer immune to [[poison]]s and the ''[[web]]'' spell.

==History==
This set of armor traveled with its owner, Kyleena Moonglow, from the land of [[Chult]] and far north to the Delimbiyr Vale, after being pushed out of their forests by [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]]s and encroaching civilization. The wild elf chieftain wore her ''silken armor'' in 1372 DR, as she negotiated with the [[Hero of Daggerford|Hero]] who represented Daggerford in the land dispute between Moonglow's tribe and local farmers.
