        "Powers": "''Gloves of the Minstrel'' were created with three enchantment strengths. Regular gloves enchanted the wearer's performance skill, ''greater gloves of the Minstrel'' made the wearer a master performer, while ''epic gloves of the Minstrel'' made the bard who put them on into an unparalleled musician.",
        "History": "The first pair of ''gloves of the Minstrel'' was commissioned by a famous musician [[Lendoku Marhael]] for his son, [[Gardoku Marhael]], whose musical skills were mediocre at best. Eventually, the [[wizard]] hired for the enchanting task realized the value of such gloves and started selling copies of the bardic \"performance enhancers.\" Subsequently, the wizard was found dead outside a tavern owned by the Marhael family.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], copies of these gloves could be found along the [[Sword Coast]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a [[tiefling]] merchant [[Vadin'ya]] sold a pair on the [[Openpalm Bazar]] in [[Samargol]]."
