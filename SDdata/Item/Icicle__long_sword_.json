        "mainbody": "'''''Icicle''''' was a unique [[long sword]] forged by the song-smith named [[Gehorg Diamondforge]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Icicle'' got its name from the [[sword]]'s blade, which had turned transparent during forging.",
        "Powers": "Apart from its impressive appearance, ''Icicle'' possessed a ''+2'' [[enchantment]] to the wielder's aim and the blade's damage. It was also especially deadly to creatures that were not scared of any sort of cold. When wielded against such creatures of cold, the weapon's blade became effectively a devastating ''+5'' enchanted weapon. Additionally, ''Icicle'' acted in the same fashion as a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' did and allowed the wielder to unleash the ''[[cone of cold]]'' [[spell]] once per day.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} Gehorg Diamondforge and many other stores of Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Market District|Market District]] fell victim to extortion by a group of criminals. These people—[[Marella]], [[Elizza]], [[Moamar]], and [[Rundell]]—were members of the warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s army that waged war on [[the Vast]] just a year prior. Gehorg spent years of his life creating weapons of great power through the ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] art of song-smithing. The master smith lost several magic weapons to the extortionists: ''Icicle'', ''[[Stone Splitter]]'', ''[[Flame Quencher]]'', and ''[[Starshine (short sword)|Starshine]]''. This loss disillusioned Gehorg Diamondforge, and he decided to leave Ravens Bluff and its corruption unless the city was to reimburse him for the masterworks lost to the people whom he perceived to be Living City watchmen."
