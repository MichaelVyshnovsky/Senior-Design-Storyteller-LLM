A '''''badge of the Watch''''' was a magical badge that was awarded to members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]] who had achieved the rank of [[Generic City Watch captain (Waterdeep)|captain]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''badge of the Watch'' had the emblem of Waterdeep. It could be either carried or worn.

==Powers==
Acquiring a ''badge of the Watch'' meant having earned the trust of the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep. Only the Open Lord could award ''badges of the Watch'', and also had the power to terminate an individual's attunement to it.

While wearing a ''badge of the Watch'', the user gained a magically enhanced ability to defend against attacks. Moreover, if the badge came to a distance of more than 5 ft (1.5 m) away from the person it was attuned to, it immediately appeared next to the Open Lord, who then needed only to hold it to become aware of the person's location.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Jalester Silvermane]], one of [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s field operatives, possessed a ''badge of the Watch''.
* [[Vajra Safahr]], the [[Blackstaff]] of the late 15{{th}} century DR, was said to have one.

==History==
During the 14{{th}} century, captains of the City Guard were given ''[[Amulet of the Watch|amulets]]'', rather than badges, that identified their status within Waterdeep.
