        "Powers": "The armor was stitched together from fragments of armor that one was worn by warlock [[Ammon Jerro]], Quarrel's beloved idol. This mismatched armor possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[bestow curse]]'' [[spell]]. The armor could also be only worn by warlocks, half-elves, and those who venerated evil.",

The armor accompanied the half-drow across the [[Sword Coast North]], the [[Mere of Dead Men]], and settled for a while in the [[Crossroad Keep]], before setting out for the land of [[Thay]] some years after the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
