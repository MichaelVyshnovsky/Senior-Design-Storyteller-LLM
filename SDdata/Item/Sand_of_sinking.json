        "Powers": "When thrown upon any other type of sand, earth, and even stone, ''sand of sinking'' transformed the area into deadly quicksand. A handful of ''sand of sinking'' was capable of transforming a {{SI|9|ft}} by {{SI|9|ft}} square for 2-8 minutes. Additional handfuls did not increase the depth, but did increase the effected area. Anyone caught within this area began to sink instantly to a maximum depth of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. Anyone stuck within the area when the magic wore off was in for a nasty surprise since the effected area solidified into its original state.\n\nIf used upon a wall, ''sand of sinking'' behaved similar to a ''[[passwall]]'' spell, creating a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} deep opening. Openings created in this manner were permanent since the quicksand flowed downward away from the opening."
