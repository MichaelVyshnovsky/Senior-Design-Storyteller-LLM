Black Chimes was a unique heavy flail that hailed from the long-destroyed by the beginning of the 14 century DR town of Slow Cedrics Gallop in Icewind Dale.
Black Chimes haft was a metal rod. Three heads were attached to it via thin black chains of iron each was a hollow metal tube. When the flail was in someones hands, its heads moved about as if in a breeze, clanking together like a wind chime. There was no way of muffling the chime sounds, not even by wrapping the weapon in padding.
The weapons possessed a +1 enchantment, and when swung in battle, the Black Chimes collided with the sound of thunder, likely leaving its targets deafened.
When the small village of Slow Cedrics Gallop was raided and destroyed by a tide of orcs in the winter of the , the entire settlement was buried under the copious winter snows of the Spine of the World. The following spring, travelers braved the dangerous Southern Pass and discovered only the top of Slow Cedrics Gallops stone belltower being above the snow. The travelers found Black Chimes laying on the towers blood-stained floor, surrounded by frozen orc corpses.
Little lore was recorded of Slow Cedrics Gallop, but it was believed that Black Chimes was the symbol of office, wielded by the towns Bell Warden, who was in charge of ringing the towers bell in the face of danger and defending the village in combat. Loremasters believed that the last, or one of the villages past Bell Warden were the creators of Black Chimes.
At one point before Mirtul of the , Black Chimes was in stock of the Gallaway Trade Depot and available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in Targos.
