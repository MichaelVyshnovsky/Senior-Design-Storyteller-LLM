'''''Staff of the holy''''' was an enchanted [[staff]] what most commonly can be seen in the hands of devote [[cleric]]s across [[Faer√ªn]].

==Powers==
''Staves of the holy'' were imbued with healing magics allowing the wielder to use ''[[aid]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', and ''[[cure moderate wound]]'' divine spells. Each staff was created with a set number of charges.

==History==
Through the years, many of the most devoted worshipers of various gods found themselves in possession of ''staves of the holy'', claiming these enchanted items were wills of their deities manifested in physical form. Sages thought these claims to be in doubt. However, these staves did find their way into the hands of truly righteous clerics over and over again, by accident or design. The sheer number of ''staves of the holy'' made claims of these items' divinity highly suspicious.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''staves of the holy'' were widespread across the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Moonsea]] regions.
