'''''Avarphyn''''' were protective devices favored by the houses of [[Myth Drannor]], most often embodied as [[bracer]]s.

==Description==
Most often, ''avarphyn'' were defensive bracers, but first-made ones, for the use of a house matron, were pendants.

==Powers==
These devices could glow with ''[[faerie fire]]''. ''Avarphyn'' also usually had protective properties; while those were rarely the most powerful, they came with a suite of powers both lesser and greater. Typical ''avarphyn'' carried six lesser and three greater powers; the use of a greater power was followed by a recharge period of ten minutes. If a greater power was used four times in a day, it was burned out of the ''avarphyn'', and required re-enchantment to regain.

All powers could operate for up to ten minutes, shutting down at the end of that time; if someone tried to extend a power past those ten minutes, that particular power in the ''avarphyn'' ceased to function for a period of ten minutes. Typically, the powers included as minor powers were ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[gaze reflection]]'', ''[[knock]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[sending]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', ''[[steadfast]]'', ''[[water breathing]]'', ''[[water walk]]'' and ''[[web]]''. Major abilities could include ''[[duo-dimension]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[free action]]'', ''[[ironguard]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', an effect akin to ''[[reverse gravity]]'' but which did not affect the wearer, ''[[spell turning]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''.

==History==
In [[Cormanthor]], these bracers were typically made for the head of the house, their consort, the heir, the next three elves in line for succession of the house, and any war leaders who were full kin to the family.

As of {{yearlink|1367}}, several hundred pairs of House [[Echorn]] ''avarphyn'' survived.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Delmuth Echorn]]: his ''avarphyn'' included ''feather fall'', ''fly'', ''free action'', ''ironguard'', ''knock'', ''neutralize poison'', ''spider climb'', and ''water walk''.
