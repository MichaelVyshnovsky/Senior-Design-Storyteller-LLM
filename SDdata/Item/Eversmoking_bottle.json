        "mainbody": "An '''''eversmoking bottle''''' was an item that constantly leaked smoke out, provided the stopper was open.",
        "Description": "Typical ''eversmoking bottles'' were stoppered bottles made of [[brass]].",
        "Powers": "Unstoppering the bottle caused a cloud of thick smoke to fill a radius of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} within a few seconds, blocking vision entirely. The cloud expanded as long as the bottle remained open, out to a maximum radius of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} over several minutes. Closing the bottle required the user to speak its command word, after which the smoke dissipated over a few minutes. Strong winds could also dissipate the smoke.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the [[Talona]] cult of [[Castle Trinity]] used an ''eversmoking bottle'' in their attempt to destroy the [[Edificant Library]]. The cultists placed the [[Chaos Curse]] potion inside the bottle, which then steadily released the Curse's maddening fumes''.''\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} the [[nalfeshnee]] [[Trantolox]] kept an ''eversmoking bottle'' when attempting to break into the [[Bleeding Citadel]] in [[Avernus]]."
