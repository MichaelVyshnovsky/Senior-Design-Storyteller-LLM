'''''Torga's Pyre''''' was an enchanted [[shortsword]] created using a heart of a [[fire elemental]] by [[Torga Burduum]] of [[Citadel Adbar]].

==Description==
''Torga's Pyre'' was a masterfully crafted sword of [[dwarf|dwarven]] design.

==Powers==
''Torga's Pyre'' possessed a ''+4'' enchantment and due to being created out of a fire elemental's heart, this shortsword dealt fire damage upon a successful hit immediately lighting the target on fire, continuously torching it for the next five seconds.

==History==
[[File:Toga's pyre.png|thumb|''Torga's Pyre, lit with its elemental flames.''|227x227px]]
Torga Burduum, an accomplished blacksmith of Citadel Adbar, set out on an arduous quest to create a truly legendary weapon. She attempted to use the heart of a powerful fire elemental [[Izzaxu]] as the core of the ''Torga's Pyre'' sword. Torga was killed by the same elemental before she could finish her masterpiece. Her drive was intense enough to bring her back in the form of a [[ghost]]. Cursed by their own desire to create, Torga and her dwarven comrades remained inside the [[Izzaxu's Kiln]] in the [[Forlorn Cliffs]] until the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]]'s arrival ''circa'' [[1490 DR]]. The Champion and their companions aided Torga in destroying the elemental creature, allowing the blacksmith to harvest its essence finally creating the ''Torga's Pyre'' blade. She passed it along to the Champion as the final gift and moved on to the [[afterlife]].
