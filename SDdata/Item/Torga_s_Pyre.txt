Torga Burduum, an accomplished blacksmith of Citadel Adbar, set out on an arduous quest to create a truly legendary weapon. She attempted to use the heart of a powerful fire elemental Izzaxu as the core of the Torgas Pyre sword. Torga was killed by the same elemental before she could finish her masterpiece. Her drive was intense enough to bring her back in the form of a ghost. Cursed by their own desire to create, Torga and her dwarven comrades remained inside the Izzaxus Kiln in the Forlorn Cliffs until the Champion of the Burning Dawns arrival circa 1490 DR. The Champion and their companions aided Torga in destroying the elemental creature, allowing the blacksmith to harvest its essence finally creating the Torgas Pyre blade. She passed it along to the Champion as the final gift and moved on to the afterlife.
