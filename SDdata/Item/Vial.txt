'''Vials''', or '''phials''', were small glass containers that were used to hold liquids and powders. They could be used in laboratories to conduct experiments or to transport these substances.

==Description==
A typical vial could hold up to {{SI|4|fl oz|c|long=yes}} of liquid. Outside of the laboratory, vials were most commonly used to store and transport [[acid]]s, [[antitoxin]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[poison]]s, and [[potion]]s.

==Availability==
A variety of vials were available for sale through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', along with matching corks and other laboratory glass containers produced in [[Urmlaspyr]] by the [[glass-blowers guild]].

==Notable Uses==
* Vials were essential in laboratories, and were also integral components of [[herbalism kit]]s and [[poisoner's kit]]s.
* Some [[healer's kit|healer's bags]] included several ceramic vials for the purpose of having clean water readily available.
* Travelers typically kept their [[spices]] inside of little glass vials, which were encased in whittled wooden 'shielding shells' to guard against breakage.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-13 - Spices When Traveling}}
