        "mainbody": "Champagne was a variety of sparkling wine found throughout the Realms. Traditionally, poured into tall delicate crystal champagne flutes in Cormyr and served in crystal tallglasses and silver champagne buckets.\n*Champagne du le Stomp, a sparkling wine made by The Wizard of Wines, in the Domains of Dread.\n*Pink Champagne, was a rare variety of champagne of an unusual color, found in the coolers of the nobility of Ravens Bluff.\nChampagne and all the fanciful accouterments that went with it, as well as a well-dressed server, could be summoned with the cane of the upper class, an enchanted walking cane. Another magic item that could create champagne was crystal alchemy jug that could generate half a gallon per use.\nBottles of champagne were used to anoint new ships by smashing them against the hull in an official ceremony in Ravens Bluff. One such ceremony was performed by Lady Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden during the unveiling RBNS Victorious in the late 14 century DR."
