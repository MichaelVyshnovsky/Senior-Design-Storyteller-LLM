        "mainbody": "'''''Scroll of protection from air''''' was a [[magic]]al [[scroll]] found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Description": "Reading this scroll created an area of protection centered around the caster, with a diameter of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. It protected the caster from all air-based spells and effects, as well as mundane wind. It also protected the caster from [[poison]]s carried in the wind. However, it offered no protection against poisons that did not travel in the wind. For example, if this scroll was read then the caster moved into a poisonous cloud, the caster was vulnerable to being poisoned. The scroll had no effect on air elemental creatures but protected the caster from their attacks."
