        "mainbody": "A wand of defoliation was a magical wand.\nUnlike typical wands or staves, these were never made of wood. Bone or ivory were usually used to make the bases instead.\nSuch wands had two functions. With a single charge, they would destroy all chlorophyll within a  radius. All grass would become very dry and brown in color. If two charges were expended, trees and other plant life within the  range would instantly die. Sentient plant life would not automatically be killed, but would suffer moderate damage. The user of the wand could instead concentrate the power into a tight cone, causing extremely high damage to the plant creatures within. and vegepygmies.\n* Adolmus a 14 century DR adventurer and a dragon-slayer.\n* Ceptienne\n* The Heroes of Ascore"
