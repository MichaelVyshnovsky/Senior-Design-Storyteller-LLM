        "Powers": "The wielder of this item could control the creature released by the powerful ''[[unleash monolith]]'' spell.\n\nThe wielder could issue commands to the summoned monolith and even dismiss the creature back to its elemental plane. The elemental monolith had a chance to resist the commands of the wielder. Maintaining control of a monolith drained power from the rod during each minute of control.",
