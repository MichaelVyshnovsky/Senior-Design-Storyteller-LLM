'''Darndarr''' was a type of [[ale]] that was renowned for its nutty taste and ease of storage and transportation. Darndarr was popular all throughout the [[Sword Coast]] the late 15{{th}} century DR for both casual consumption and use in marinades.

==Description==
Darndarr's taste was often described as nutty, or "sandy". Its flavor was easily paired with commons foods such as seared meats and [[fish]].

Darndarr was popular among merchants and traders for its ease of transportation, as it kept well, even out in [[the sun]].

Traditionally, darndarr was served in small [[earthenware]] [[jug]]s. The jugs themselves were often used in pranks as they easily broke down into powder upon impact. These prank projectiles were referred to as "drench people" missiles.

==Popularity==
Many people of the Sword Coast had [[keg]]s or [[jar]]s of darndarr in their homes for cooking, drinking, or even to keep perishable foods in. This preservation tradition was referred to as "jugging" something.
