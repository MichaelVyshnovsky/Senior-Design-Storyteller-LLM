        "mainbody": "Striker staves were enchanted quarterstaves wielded by wizard-priests of Talassan faith.\nStriker staves were created out of old oak trees, downed by fierce storms sent by Talos. When the Striker staves were crafted, they still carried blackened burns from Talos wrath.\nA typical Striker was fortified with powerful enchantments and blessings that sealed the lingering essence of Talos inside them. These rituals granted the staves +3 enchantment and allowed additional lightning damage when wielded in combat, discharging Talos rage on their targets.\nStrikers origins laid with a certain Talassan cult of wizard-priests. Several of these staves could be found in the Moonsea and in the vicinity of Voonlar circa 1374 DR.\n*Zacharus, a wizard member of the Order of the Crippled Fang who participated on the attack on the temple of the Dark God Reformed and murder of High Priest Gormstadd."
