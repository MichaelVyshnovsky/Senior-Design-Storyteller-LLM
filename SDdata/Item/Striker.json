        "Description": "''Striker'' staves were created out of old [[oak]] trees, downed by fierce storms sent by [[Talos]]. When the ''Striker'' staves were crafted, they still carried blackened burns from Talos' wrath.",
        "Powers": "A typical ''Striker'' was fortified with powerful enchantments and blessings that sealed the lingering essence of Talos inside them. These rituals granted the staves ''+3'' enchantment and allowed additional lightning damage when wielded in combat, discharging Talos' rage on their targets.",
        "History": "''Strikers''' origins laid with a certain Talassan cult of wizard-priests. Several of these staves could be found in the [[Moonsea]] and in the vicinity of [[Voonlar]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Zacharus]], a wizard member of the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]] who participated on the attack on the temple of the [[Dark God Reformed]] and murder of High Priest [[Gormstadd]]."
