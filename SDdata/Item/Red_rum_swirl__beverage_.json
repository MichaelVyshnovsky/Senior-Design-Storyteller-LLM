        "mainbody": "ed Rum Swirl was a pleasant comfort alcoholic beverage that was served in inns and taverns across the Realms during the 14 century DR, such as the Hidden Lady.\nRed Rum Swirl was a nutty, pleasant, and gentle softly colored red drink. Its hue was due to the sparing use of cherry brandy. The rest of the ingredients used in the mixed drink included a base of rum mixed with an abundant amount of almond brandy and stirred-in caramel, made out of cream and sugar.\nThe gentle sweetness of the drink made it easy to drink too much, oftentimes leaving imbibers extremely maudlin and intoxicated."
