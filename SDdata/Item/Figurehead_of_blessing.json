        "mainbody": "A figurehead of blessing was a magical figurehead (a carved wooden sculpture decorating the bow of a ship). \nA ship protected by this figurehead was able to increase its maximum speed, whether it was driven by oars or sails. The figurehead also made it easier for the crew to detect and avoid maritime dangers, and served to strengthen the integrity of the ships hull. The guarded vessel was able to navigate violent waters and stormy weather more safely, and lastly, it provided the ship with partial protection against fire.\nThe figurehead of blessing was used mainly by the Northmen of Moonshae on the longships of notable personages including kings."
