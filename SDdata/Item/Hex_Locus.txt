The '''Hex Locus''' was an [[artifact]] created by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] using a solidified chunk of [[Spellplague]].

==Description==
The Hex Locus was a chunk of frozen, solidified [[blue fire]]. If touched, it was colder than even the waters of the [[Styx]], but it was also hotter than the [[the sun|Sun]].

==Abilities==
As part of the Spellplague, the Hex Locus could warp reality by releasing the defiling energies of the [[Far Realm]] contained within it. If used in living creatures, it twisted and corrupted them into [[aberration]]s, though usually no one survived a direct contact with the Hex Locus. 

The Hex Locus could also increase the range of the [[Symphony of Madness]] tenfold. According to the [[aboleth]]s, the Hex Locus could turn the Symphony of Madness into reality.

The Hex Locus had its own consciousness, and could communicate telepathically with its targets. Its consciousness was later merged with [[Rohini]]'s. granting Rohini the ability to see into the [[Weave]] to predict the future.

==History==
In [[1478 DR]], Brother [[Vartan]], an [[Oghma]]nite priest and thrall of the Abolethic Sovereignty, used the Hex Locus to turn the [[succubus]] Rohini into an agent of the Sovereignty. The Hex Locus was later safeguarded in a cavern near [[Helm's Hold]], at first protected by the [[plaguechanged]] [[green dragon]] [[Chartilifax]].
