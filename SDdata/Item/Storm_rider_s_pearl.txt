The '''''storm rider's pearl''''' was a [[marid]] item used by the [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari|Great Padisha of the Marid]].

==Storm Rider's Pearl==
The ''storm rider's pearl'' was similar to the ''[[traveler's pearl]]s'' but also allowed the Padisha to alter wind, summon storms, and to change the tides. It was not consumed upon use like the ''traveler's pearls''.
