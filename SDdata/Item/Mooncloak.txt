A '''''mooncloak''''' was a magical [[cloak]] used by the [[church of Selûne]] that protected the wearer and let them walk on air and water alike.

==Description==
It was a cloak of silvery gray color that weighed 1 pound (0.45 kilograms).

==Powers==
After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], it was considered a ''[[cloak of protection]] +1'' that granted use of the spells ''[[water walk]]'' and ''[[levitate]]'' as the wearer willed. After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], it functioned as a ''[[cloak of resistance]]'' of variable strength, with ''water walk'' and ''levitate'' each usable only once a day.

==Creation==
''Mooncloaks'' were most often created by an appearance of ''[[moonfire]]'' at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess [[Selûne]] was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy. Nevertheless, by 1372 DR, other spellcasters had discovered how to replicate them. This required the ''levitate'' and ''water walk'' [[spell]]s in addition to ''[[resistance]]''.

==Value==
Prices ranged from 9,000 to 34,800 [[gold piece]]s, depending on the amount of protection bestowed.
