        "Powers": "The gloves possessed a helpful enchantment that significantly boosted the wearer's manual dexterity and sleight of hand. However, if the gloves' wearer used this magic to steal something, a small piece of [[coal]] appeared in the thief's pocket, as if the magic was judging them.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''unlucky thief's gloves'' was displayed among splendorous enchanted rewards for those willing to partake in [[Akabi]]'s Wheel of Fortune game in the [[Circus of the Last Days]] during its stay in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
