A gem of insight was a magic item that made it easier for whoever carried it to understand things.
These items were always jewels worth at least 5,000 gp without the magical enchantment.
After being carried for two weeks, a gem of insight began making it easier for its carrier to understand things and boosted their memory. After possessing the gem for three months, the carrier would actually become more intelligent and wise. If an individual no longer carried the gem after that three month period, their intelligence would remain boosted, but their wisdom would revert back to normal. A gem of insight could only provide these benefits once per individual.
