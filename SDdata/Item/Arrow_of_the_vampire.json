        "mainbody": "'''''Arrows of the vampire''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] ammunition often used by various [[bow]]men of the Realms.",
        "Powers": "These [[arrows]] were enchanted with spells similar in effect to the ''vampiric regeneration''. When an ''arrow of the vampire'' hit its target, the magics inside syphoned the life energy out of the target and into the shooter.",
        "History": "In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], many enchanted ''arrows of the vampire'' were a common sight along the [[Sword Coast]], and used by numerous individuals and factions. The origin of these arrows, however, remained a mystery. Some told stories that ''arrows of the vampire'' were made using teeth of actual [[vampire]]s. This was probably not true due to the sheer number of these arrows circulating the [[quiver]]s in the Realms.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Feldran Exeltis]], a lone heir of the [[Exeltis]] noble family kept a quiver of the ''arrows of the vampire'' in his bedroom ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]."
