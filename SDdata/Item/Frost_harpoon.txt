The '''''frost harpoon''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[spear]] crafted by the [[Ulutiun]] people of the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
The ''frost harpoon'' had an inscribing along its haft written in small script. It read: "Until [[Ulutiu]] wakes, none will make me sleep."

==Powers==
Those who touched this [[polearm]], immediately felt a strong sensation of loss as well as a combination of deathless and unending patience. The weapon radiated chill all around it. The weapon possessed a strong ''+4'' enchantment and dealt magical cold damage to its targets. The spear's head was ensorcelled with the ''[[keen]]'' magics that made it always sharp and capable of dispensing dramatically increased punishment.

==History==
It was unknown how the ''frost harpoon'' traveled from the faraway region of the Great Glacier to the land of witches and berserkers, [[Rashemen]]. The weapon was stored within a burial burrow in Rashemen, north of the city of [[Mulsantir]], where the great spirit of [[Okku]] rested until the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
