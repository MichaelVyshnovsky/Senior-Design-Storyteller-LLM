        "mainbody": "'''''Lastri's short rapier''''' was a short and slender [[enchanted]] [[rapier]] that belonged to Captain [[Lastri Kassireh‎]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Powers": "This magic rapier was designed to only be used by [[halfling]]s, and its magics could only be tapped into by [[swashbuckler]]s. This slender blade carried a minor ''+1'' enchantment.''",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the rapier was wielded by Captain Kassireh‎ when her prized vessel, the ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' was sabotaged and perished in a deadly storm off the coast of [[Samarach]]. The Captain survived, subsequently changing her career to adventuring, bringing her enchanted weapon along."
