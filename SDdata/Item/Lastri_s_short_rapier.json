        "mainbody": "Lastris short rapier was a short and slender enchanted rapier that belonged to Captain Lastri Kassireh‎ circa 1374 DR.\nThis magic rapier was designed to only be used by halflings, and its magics could only be tapped into by swashbucklers. This slender blade carried a minor +1 enchantment.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the rapier was wielded by Captain Kassireh‎ when her prized vessel, the Vigilant was sabotaged and perished in a deadly storm off the coast of Samarach. The Captain survived, subsequently changing her career to adventuring, bringing her enchanted weapon along."
