'''''Antimagic cloaks''''' were [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that could shelter the wearer from magical and physical harm.

==Powers==
''Antimagic cloaks'' were created using fibers from plants grown during the [[Time of Troubles]]. The fibers were woven center to the ''[[Weave]]'', allowing the cloth to disperse and fade magics around it safely. These cloaks gave the wearer high resistance to spells as well as gave them the ability to cast the ''[[lesser globe of invulnerability]]'' once per day.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one of these, ''antimagic cloaks'' could be found in the collection of a planeswalker from [[Westgate]] known only as [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent. It was available for purchase at [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] store in Westgate's [[Market Triangle]].
