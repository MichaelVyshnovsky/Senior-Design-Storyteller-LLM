'''''Undermountain Homebrew''''' was a type of magical spirits from [[Undermountain]], available in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The [[enchanted]] drink was on the menu at the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern of Waterdeep, stashed away in [[Durnan]]'s cabinet. One serving of ''Undermountain Homebrew'' was priced at ten [[gold]] [[coin]]s.
