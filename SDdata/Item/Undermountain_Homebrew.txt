Undermountain Homebrew was a type of magical spirits from Undermountain, available in the city of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
The enchanted drink was on the menu at the Yawning Portal tavern of Waterdeep, stashed away in Durnans cabinet. One serving of Undermountain Homebrew was priced at ten gold coins.
