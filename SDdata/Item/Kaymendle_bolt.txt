'''''Kaymendle bolts''''' were ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' converted to objects by the magic of [[Kaymendle Skrip]]. They were still generated by the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The typical bolt was from {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} to {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} long, appearing as a spear of smoky glass that radiated a soft golden light. They had the feel of sticky cotton, weighing only a few ounces, and being as flexible as [[bamboo]]. When broken, they dissipated in a flash of golden light.

==Powers==
Fully half of all ''Kaymendle bolts'' disappeared in a shower of sparks at the slighest touch; if no one touched them, they faded into nothing within a couple days. Of the other half, two thirds exploded within two to five minutes after the shower of sparks began, zapping quite heavily anyone within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}}. Even those bolts, however, vanished within a couple days on their own.

The remainder of ''Kaymendle bolts'', were fully stable, and could be thrown as spears; if thrown further than {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}}, it dealt the same damage as the explosion, though only to the target struck. Thrown less than ten feet, they dealt no damage, instead bursting into a shower of sparks. It disappeared on contact, could not be used to set fire to anything, and wouldn't reflect off any surfaces.

Telling which behaviour a Kaymendle bolt had required trial and error unless one had a ''[[true seeing]]'' spell.

==History==
After ranchers north of the [[Hullack Forest]], near the [[Thunder Peaks]], hired [[Kaymendle Skrip]] to do something about the damage that lightning bolts were causing to their crops, he enchanted the atmosphere to create heavier lightning bolts, so that they would fall down before they could do any damage. However, these bolts continued to cause damage and created stationary hazards; he was forced to flee.

''Kaymendle bolts'' continued to form into the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], though occassionally, and only within {{SI|50|miles|k|long=yes}} of the Thunder Peaks. ''Kaymendle bolts'' were found floating on ponds, stuck on trees, and sometimes just lying on the ground.
