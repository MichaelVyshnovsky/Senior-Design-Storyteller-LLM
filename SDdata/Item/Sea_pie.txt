Sea pie was a variety of savory pastry with a seafood filling, which originated from the coastal town of Marsember in Cormyr.
The pastry shell was made using bacon-fat dough, and was filled with a thick dark beef-base stew of potatoes and diced aquatic creatures, such as skate, squid, and more. The filling was cooked for a long period until the fish flesh was soft and fell apart in the stew, then ladled into the dough crust and baked.
Sea pies were available from The Wight on a Waterdragon, a crowded eatery of Marsember in the late 14 century DR.
