'''''Sending stones''''' were magical items that allowed remote communication over any distance, even across different [[plane]]s.

==Description==
''Sending stones'' always came in pairs. They were smooth and delicately carved to match each other, so the pairs were easily recognizable. If one stone from the pair were destroyed, the other would lose its magic.

==Powers==
When activated, a ''sending stone'' could be used to cast a ''[[sending]]'' spell targeted at the bearer of its pair. If the receiving stone had no bearer at the moment of the casting, the stone did not cast the spell and made the user aware of it. This power could be used once, after which the stone regained its magic at dawn.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Beldora]], a [[Harper]] agent stationed in [[Bryn Shander]] in the late 1480s [[DR]], used a ''sending stone'' regularly to report to her fellow agent [[Thwip Ironbottom]] in [[Hundelstone]].

* [[Salida]], a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] spy in [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], used a ''sending stone'' to report anyone that was searching for [[Omu]] to [[Ras Nsi]].

* The [[Flaming Fist]] commander [[Liara Portyr]] held a ''sending stone'' which she used to apprise the [[Calishite]] pirate [[Zaroum Al-Saryak]] about any ships leaving or entering [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]].
