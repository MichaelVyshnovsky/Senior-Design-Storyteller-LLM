'''''Golden lutes of Shazar''''' were a unique [[lute]]s that were [[enchanted]] by the music-loving aristocrat from [[Mulhorand]] named [[Shazar]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Apart from dramatically improving the owner's musical aptitude, at least one of the ''golden lutes of Shazar'' allows the [[bard]] wielder to cast several [[spell]]s. The ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' spell cast at a high proficiency level could be dispensed once per day, and the same went for a powerful version of a ''[[haste]]'' spell.

==History==
Ten ''golden lutes of Shazar'' were commissioned by Shazar long before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, to serve as a gift for the pharaoh of the time. The pharaoh, a creature of musical taste and thunderous temper, was delighted hearing the ten ''golden lutes'' sing in the hands of master [[minstrel]]s. Unbeknownst to the pharaoh, skill-busting [[enchantment]]s were weaved into the instruments, allowing the minstrels to perform beyond their natural skills. Eventually, the ruler found out about the magic and took it as a great offense. Shazar and his minstrels were executed. Despite the incident, the pharaoh kept all ten lutes, and after his death, they were interred along with the pharaoh.

Many years later, the pharaoh's tomb was plundered, and the ten ''golden lutes of Shazar'' were scattered across [[Faer√ªn]]. In [[1374 DR]], one of the lutes belonged to a musician [[Cain Lethellon]], who cockily challenged bards and entertainers to a lute-off in the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]]. Some said that the minstrel was beaten in his own competition by the famed [[Kalach-Cha]] or one of their companions, losing the ''Golden lutes of Shazar'' as a result.
