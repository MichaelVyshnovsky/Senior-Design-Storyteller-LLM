Baldurans Giantslayer was a giant slayer greatsword once wielded by Balduran, the legendary explorer and founder of Baldurs Gate.
The blade of the giantslayer was battered down and rough. It featured several serrations and a hooked tip. Its golden crossguard resembled the open maw of a dragon and had, over time, become encrusted with some manner of red, bubbly growth.
Baldurans Giantslayer possessed a +3 enchantment and granted the wielder several boons. It was exceptionally potent against imposing creatures, from those as large as an ogre to those as grand as dragons, and could even knock them down with a successful strike.
Whenever the giantslayer did successfully strike down a foe, the wielder felt a surge of supernatural strength. That strength allowed them to assail large creatures with even greater efficacy.
One or more times per day the wielder of Baldurans Giantslayer could grow in size themselves, for about a minutes duration.
