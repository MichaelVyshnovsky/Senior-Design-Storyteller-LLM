        "mainbody": "'''Haramaki''' and '''haramaki-do''' were types of light armor used in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Haramaki was a lightweight armor that was designed to protect the torso and back of an individual, hence its informal name of \"belly protector\". It was made from either chainmail or small metal plates, held together with [[silk]]. It was not bulky and was light enough to be worn under clothing.\n\nHaramaki-do was identical in appearance and made from the same material but was heavier and bulkier, and could not be worn under most clothing.",
