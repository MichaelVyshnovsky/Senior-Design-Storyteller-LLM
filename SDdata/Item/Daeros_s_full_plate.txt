Daeross full plate was a dwarven-crafted suit of full plate armor worn by Daeros Dragonspear, builder of Dragonspear Castle.
While it was crafted from heavy steel the breastplate was notable light. The front of the armor bore a detailed relief of flying copper dragon, presumably Daeross companion Halatathlaer.
It was believed to have been made by the dwarves of Kanaglym.
The suit of  +1 full plate mail protected the wearer from fire and the devastating breath of dragons.
