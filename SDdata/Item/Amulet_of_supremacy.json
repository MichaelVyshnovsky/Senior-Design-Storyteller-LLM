        "mainbody": "An amulet of supremacy was an extremely rare type of magical amulet that was only worn by dragons of Toril. It was immensely powerful piece of jewelry and was considered priceless among their species.\nA masterpiece of draconic craftsmanship, this amulet was made from the purest strains of metal and was adorned with flawless gems that shone with the utmost brilliance. Craftmanship and material value combined was such that it was considered beyond pricing.\nWhen worn, the amulet maximized the natural powers and spellcasting abilities of a dragon. It increased the destructive potential of the dragons breath weapon and extended the duration, area of effect and damage of the spells they cast to their highest capabilities.\nAny being other than a dragon who attempted to wear an amulet of supremacy died instantly, typically by immolation or disintegration after the amulet sapped the non-dragon of parts of his or her life force. The latter effect lasted even when the non-dragon survived killing effects.\nOnly the oldest dragons, who possessed the highest levels of arcane power were capable of crafting an amulet of supremacy. As such, only a handful of them have appeared throughout the history of the Realms.\n*Tchazzar The Father of Chessenta owned and habitually wore an amulet of supremacy."
