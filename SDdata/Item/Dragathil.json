        "mainbody": "ragathil was a magical rapier and one of the baneblades of Demron created in Myth Drannor.\nIt was a rapier crafted for elf or human hands. It had a slightly curved blade with a row of four small rubies set down the center. It had a large basket hilt shaped to resemble three harps with twined around them. When drawn, it glowed as bright as a torch with a fearsome red light, but this could be shut off at will.\nAs a baneblade of Demron, it was a +4 holy weapon that was a bane to both undead and evil outsiders. Although Dragathil looked threatening, it was actually designed to subdue foes with mercy. It let its bearer use hold person once a day. It was only usable by those skilled at persuasion and negotiation, and was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.\nDragathil was crafted by the archmage Demron before the fall of Myth Drannor, and is the fifth of his series of baneblades."
