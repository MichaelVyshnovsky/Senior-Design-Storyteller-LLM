        "mainbody": "'''''Dragathil''''' was a magical [[rapier]] and one of the ''[[baneblades of Demron]]'' created in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "It was a rapier crafted for [[elf]] or [[human]] hands. It had a slightly curved blade with a row of four small [[ruby|rubies]] set down the center. It had a large basket hilt shaped to resemble three harps with twined around them. When drawn, it glowed as bright as a [[torch]] with a fearsome red light, but this could be shut off at will.",
        "Powers": "As a ''baneblade of Demron'', it was a ''+4 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]]'' weapon that was a ''[[bane (property)|bane]]'' to both [[undead]] and [[evil]] [[outsider]]s. Although ''Dragathil'' looked threatening, it was actually designed to subdue foes with mercy. It let its bearer use ''[[hold person]]'' once a day. It was only usable by those skilled at persuasion and negotiation, and was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.",
        "History": "''Dragathil'' was crafted by the archmage [[Demron]] before the fall of Myth Drannor, and is the fifth of his series of ''baneblades''."
