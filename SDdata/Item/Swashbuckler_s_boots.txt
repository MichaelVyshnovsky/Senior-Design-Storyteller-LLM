Swashbucklers Boots were a type of footwear created specifically to complement buccaneers footwork.
These boots were incredibly comfortable. They augmented the users dodging ability during their swashbuckling adventures and duels.
After the Wailing Death of 1372 DR these boots could be found in the places along the Sword Coast and islands of the Sea of Swords frequented by pirates and sailors.
