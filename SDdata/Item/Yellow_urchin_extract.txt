'''Yellow urchin extract''' was a type of [[poison]] deliverable via water inhalation, making it effective underwater. It was harvested by aquatic humanoids to use against their foes from a certain species of the [[urchin]].

==Description==
Yellow urchin poison (the extract) was most valued among aquatic sentient species for its ability to be delivered via inhalation, unlike other types of poisons. When extracted, it was a thick and milky fluid. Used underwater, it created a cloud of poison {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} wide that naturally dispersed after 10 minutes, or 1 minute in a strong current. The toxins affected any water-breathing creatures that passed through the poison cloud (including creatures under the effect of the ''[[water breathing]]'' or a similar spell), unless they were able to hold their breath. A vial of this unique poison was valued at 800 [[gp]], owing to harvesting being a long and tedious process.
