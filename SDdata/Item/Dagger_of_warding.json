        "mainbody": "Daggers of warding were enchanted daggers that protected their wielder from creatures venerating evil.\nThese daggers were white in color, the blades metal as well as the hilt.\nDaggers of warding possessed no additional enchantments apart from allowing their wielders to cast protection from evil at will.\nIn 1369 DR, one of these enchanted daggers belonged to an unnamed lich who dwelt within the ruined Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor. The undead creature avoided conflicts with the drow of House Freth and the Cult of the Dragon who shaped the catacombs at the time. The lich performed unholy necromantic experiments in his secluded lab and was guarded by enthralled spectres. After the lichs phylactery was smashed, the dagger of warding was claimed by the Veiled Ones."
