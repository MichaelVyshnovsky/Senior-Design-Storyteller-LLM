        "mainbody": "'''''Daggers of warding''''' were [[enchanted]] [[dagger]]s that protected their wielder from creatures venerating evil.",
        "Description": "These daggers were white in color, the blades' metal as well as the hilt.",
        "Powers": "''Daggers of warding'' possessed no additional enchantments apart from allowing their wielders to cast ''[[protection from evil]]'' at will.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], one of these enchanted daggers belonged to an unnamed [[lich]] who dwelt within the ruined [[Elven Catacombs]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. The [[undead]] creature avoided conflicts with the [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]] who shaped the catacombs at the time. The lich performed unholy [[necromantic]] experiments in his secluded lab and was guarded by enthralled [[spectre]]s. After the lich's ''[[phylactery]]'' was smashed, the ''dagger of warding'' was claimed by the [[Veiled Ones]]."
