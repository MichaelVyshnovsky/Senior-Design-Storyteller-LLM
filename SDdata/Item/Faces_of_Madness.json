        "mainbody": "The '''''Faces of Madness''''' were seven [[artifact]]s of ancient [[Imaskar]]. Each of them was a [[mask (object)|mask]] themed after a [[school of magic]]. They were intended to be used to overthrow Imaskar and achieve unlimited power, but the Mulan Rebellion prevented their creators from taking full advantage of their powers.{{Cite dragon/281/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Imaskarcana: Faces of Magic}}",
        "Powers": "Each of the Faces of Madness carried great power over a school of magic, and bore a horrifying curse that only the creator of each mask knew how to bypass.",
        "History": "The [[Cabal of Madness]] was an alliance of Imaskari [[archmage]]s in pursuit of power without limits. They gained the knowledge of how to build artifacts from horrors beyond their world, and over decades, constructed several masks of such power. The masks were finished before {{yearlink|-2488}}, but not soon enough to allow the Cabal to carry out its plans: the [[Mulan]] rebelled, bolstered by the powers of their pantheons arriving that year. The masks became lost in the resulting tumult. One of them resurfaced in {{yearlink|-2487}}, carried by [[Kujawa]] to [[Thakos]].\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century, they were sought by a number of groups, among them the [[Harpers]], the [[Red Wizards]], mages from [[Halruaa]], the [[Zhentarim]], and the [[Tel'Teukiira]]. Though their number was not known with certainty, knowledge of seven of them was still available at that time. They were considered to be the ''Imaskarcana'' by some sources,",
