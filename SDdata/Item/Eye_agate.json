        "mainbody": "'''Eye agate''' was a special form of [[banded agate]] found in the Realms.",
        "Description": "Eye agate was similar to banded agate but with the layers within the stone arranged in [[wikipedia:concentric|concentric]] rings. These rings came in a variety of colors, typically gray, white, brown, grayish blue, and drab green. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "Like banded agates, these [[ornamental stones]] were often ground up and used in sleeping draughts, though their effectiveness was unknown and the practice was attributed to folklore.",
        "Reputation": "Blue eye agate was a common stone among the drow, a gem worn by drow of average station, albeit only by followers of [[Ghaunadaur]] and only those with blue circles."
