        "mainbody": "Spellblade was a magical quality that could be applied to weapons, granting immunity to one spell.\nThis magical enchantment made the wielder of the weapon immune to a single spell of the weapon creators choice, but only if it was directly targeted at the wielder. It had no effect on spells that covered a large area. The spell was absorbed by the weapon and the wielder could then choose to redirect the spell at a target of their choosing, or let it drain away harmlessly.\nCreation of a spellblade weapon required a spell turning spell and typically increased the price of creating a weapon by 2,000 to 6,000 gold pieces."
