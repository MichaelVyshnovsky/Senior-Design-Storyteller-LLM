A '''''bag of tricks''''' was a magic item that could materialize a variety of friendly [[animal]]s.

==Description==
''Bags of tricks'' resembled ordinary bags made of cloth, sometimes stitched with animal designs. There were typically three varieties, depending the color of the cloth: grey, rust or tan.

==Powers==
[[File:Bag_of_tricks-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''This, too, is a ''bag of tricks''.'']]
By reaching inside a ''bag of tricks'', which always appeared empty, the user would find and pull a small fuzzy object. When throwing this object, it would then transform into an animal with a friendly disposition towards the one who pulled it, as well as their companions. This could be done up to three times, until the bag recharged its magic at the next dawn.

The kind of animal pulled could not be controlled by the bag's owner, but different colors of ''bag of tricks'' offered different selections of animals.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Fenwick Tallgrass]]
* [[Alaestra Ulgar]] and [[Narth Tezrin]], proprietors of [[The Lion's Share]] store in [[Triboar]].
