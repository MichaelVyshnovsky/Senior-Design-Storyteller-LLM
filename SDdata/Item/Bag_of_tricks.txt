By reaching inside a bag of tricks, which always appeared empty, the user would find and pull a small fuzzy object. When throwing this object, it would then transform into an animal with a friendly disposition towards the one who pulled it, as well as their companions. This could be done up to three times, until the bag recharged its magic at the next dawn.
The kind of animal pulled could not be controlled by the bags owner, but different colors of bag of tricks offered different selections of animals.
