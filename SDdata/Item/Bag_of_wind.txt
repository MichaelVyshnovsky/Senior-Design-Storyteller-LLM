Bags of wind were enchanted bundles of cloth or bags that contained trapped wind inside.
Each bag held three uses and upon being opened, unleashed a powerful gust of wind that could knock the users opponents off their feet.
Bags of wind received some use in the late 14 century in the kingdom of Cormyr, found in settlements of Hultail, Morfen, Polters Fort, and Thunderstone.
