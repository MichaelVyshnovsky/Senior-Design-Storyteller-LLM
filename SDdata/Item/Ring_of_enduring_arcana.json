        "mainbody": "A ring of enduring arcana was a magical ring that rendered a spellcasters spells more resistant to dispelling. They were favored by mages facing rivals of similar might.\nTo forge a ring of enduring arcana, a spellcaster must have dispel magic available.\nA ring of enduring arcana was a fine latticework of gold and mithral that covers most of the length of the wearers finger, with a joint in the middle to allow movement. It appeared to shift and flow whenever the wearer cast a spell.\nA ring of enduring arcana was permanently active for as long as it was worn.  However, it did require 24 hours to acclimate to the wearer, starting when it was donned."
