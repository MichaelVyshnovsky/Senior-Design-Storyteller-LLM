        "mainbody": "A '''''staff of Silverymoon''''' was a [[unicorn]]-headed [[magic]]al [[staff]] given to the [[High Mage of Silverymoon|High Mages]] of [[Silverymoon]] once they began their rule. Each staff had a variety of magical abilities, fitting their status as an emblem of the Gem of the North, many of which were tied to the city's own wards and enchantments.{{Cite dragon annual/1996/Gem of the North|55,59-60}}",
        "Description": "The body of a ''staff of Silverymoon'' was made from a thin, dark wood, and carried atop it a carving of a [[unicorn]]'s head.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Sleeping Dragon's Wake}}",
        "Powers": {
            "In Silverymoon": "Due to their special importance to the Gem of the North, the ''staffs of Silverymoon'' could also affect the city's most notable feature, the [[Moonbridge]]. Not only was such a staff capable of activating or ending the Moonbridge itself, but it could also make the bridge radiate [[moonfire]], turning it visible, as well as reversing gravity across either segments or the whole of the Moonbridge for a few seconds.",
            "In General": "The wielder of a ''staff of Silverymoon'' could, with only a moment's concentration, flawlessly intuit the exact place where any other staff was to be found. This ability had no limit, being confined only by the borders of [[Realmspace]].\n\nA ''staff of Silverymoon'' allowed the High Mage to ''[[teleport]]'' to any of the other staffs or, conversely, ''teleport'' them to the High Mage. This was an intrinsic element of the staff, and so carried no chance for error, nor was there any barrier (none, at least, known to the High Mages) capable of blocking a ''staff of Silverymoon'' from teleporting when called. In the instance that a High Mage attempted to ''teleport'' to a staff that was entirely confined by a solid, however, they would be made aware of it before being transported. This, then, allowed them to choose whether they wanted to instead ''teleport'' to a safe position nearby the staff or to not ''teleport'' at all.   \n\n[[File:Alustriel Soars.png|thumb|right|250px|''The High Mage Alustriel frequently enjoyed her staff's ability to'' fly''.'']]\nThe staff's ability to create the Moonbridge was partially channeled through certain magical totems that were inlaid beneath the shores of the [[River Rauvin]], but this was only because of the Moonbridge's sheer size. In any other situation, a ''staff of Silverymoon'' can still create similar bridges, measuring {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} in width and {{SI|90|feet|long=yes}} in length. Any larger a gap and the construct simply hovered, extended to its limit but firmly rooted, one end to the ground and the other to the middle of the air. Whether or not it reached the other side, any bridge created by a ''staff of Silverymoon'' provided steady ground on which anyone could walk.  \n\nA ''staff of Silverymoon'' also automatically conferred protections akin to a ''[[greater spell immunity]]'' spell onto any and all who were touching it. The wielder of the staff could further induce a ''[[restoration]]'' effect, though this was not automatic, and could only be done once every [[tenday]].\n\nEach staff allowed its wielder to cast a selection of [[spells]] every day, though the number of times each could be used varied. Of the highest frequency was ''[[hold monster]]'', which a ''staff of Silverymoon'' could cast six times in the span of one day. Thrice a day, such a staff could grant its wielder the ability to ''[[know alignment]]'' or ''[[fly]]'', and was also capable of forming a ''[[wall of force]]'', while twice a day, it had the power to ''[[animate rock]]'' or create a ''[[passwall]]''. Only once every day was a ''staff of Silverymoon'' able to form a ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'', a ''[[forcecage]]'', ''[[chain lightning]]'', or a ''[[dimension door]]''. This last one was the most unique, as it was another effect that could be extended to anyone touching the staff at the same time, each one being transported wherever they willed, no matter if they all shared their target destination or not."
        },
        "History": "The history of the ''staffs of Silverymoon'' was almost as long as that of the High Mages themselves. Their legacy began in the {{YearlinkName|712}} with the second of these ruling [[wizards]], [[Aglanthol|Aglanthol the Red]], who made and enchanted his duskwood staff himself. From then on, each High Mage had their own, unique ''staff of Silverymoon'' made, and carried it throughout their time in office.\n\n[[File:The High Lady's Palace.png|thumb|left|250px|''After her departure from office, however, Taern received and wielded his very own staff.'']]\nThe second of these staffs was held by the third High Mage, [[Ederan Nharimlur]]. However, forty-seven years into his rule, in the {{YearlinkName|766}}, his ''staff of Silverymoon'' was stolen by members of the [[Brotherhood of the Black Hand]] and never recovered. As of [[1370 DR]], the staff still remained in the crumbling ruins of [[Hellgate Keep]].\n\nThe staff of the ninth High Mage, [[Orjalun]], was left with his apprentice, [[Sepur]], who would himself become the tenth ruler of Silverymoon. After Sepur left the Gem of the North only two years into his High Mageship, his ''staff of Silverymoon'' served as one of his few identifying remains in the [[Evermoors]], where it lay shattered and surrounded by scorch marks. \n\nOnce their respective High Mage was interred in the palace's crypt, most staffs were moved there as well, held in the grasp of a marble statue of their past owner. Even Orjalun's ''staff of Silverymoon'' rested above his empty bier.    \n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century, beyond the ones owned by [[Alustriel Silverhand]] and [[Taern Hornblade]], the two High Mages at the time, there were also at least two more ''staffs of Silverymoon'' across the [[Northwest Faer√ªn|North]]. Both were hidden, one in the [[Harper]] base of [[Moongleam Tower]], in nearby [[Everlund]], and the other in [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Blackstaff Tower]]. It was rumored, though unconfirmed, that even more could be found beyond the Savage North. Some suggested that they were located in various catacombs, but the more common claims said there was one at the [[Herald's Holdfast]] and another was kept by Lady [[Saharel]] of [[Spellgard]].",
        "Notable Staffs of Silverymoon": "* Rather than carrying atop it the Silvaeren symbol of the unicorn's head, Ederan Nharimlur's stolen duskwood staff was crowned with the head of a [[cat]].  It could cast ''[[spell turning]]'' and ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' twice, as well as ''[[darkvision]]'', ''[[alter self]]'', and ''[[cat's grace]]'' once, before needing to recharge."
