        "mainbody": "'''Black wine''' was a variety of salty dark [[wine]] originating in the city of [[Phelzol]] in [[Semphar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">Although \"black wine\" has been mentioned many times, it's often unclear when it's a generic dark-red wine or a regular wine in low illumination or even colored, and when it's intended to be a specific type of wine. Moreover, some black-hued wines are not salty and clearly very different (such as among drow), while others are salty but have separate names and details, such as utterdark. As such, this article covers only salty black wines that can't be linked to anything else. Nevertheless, it is unclear if these wines should be the same or not.",
        "Description": "The black-hued wine was strong-tasting and bitter, while it was customary to sprinkle on [[salt]] prior to every sip. As such, some thought it vile, but it had its enthusiasts.",
        "Powers": "",
        "History": "",
        "Reputation": "In [[Ravens Bluff]], the [[Cult of the Raven]] shared a communal cup of salty black wine during their ceremonies, calling the [[Blood of the Raven]]. They believed it granted the most favored among them dream visions from [[the Raven]] whom they revered.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Ruldarr]], proprietor of [[Ruldarr's Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture]] in [[Bargewright Inn]], who had a taste for it."
