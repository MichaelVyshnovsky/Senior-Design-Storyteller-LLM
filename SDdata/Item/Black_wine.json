        "mainbody": "Black wine was a variety of salty dark wine originating in the city of Phelzol in Semphar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.Although \"black wine\" has been mentioned many times, its often unclear when its a generic dark-red wine or a regular wine in low illumination or even colored, and when its intended to be a specific type of wine. Moreover, some black-hued wines are not salty and clearly very different (such as among drow), while others are salty but have separate names and details, such as utterdark. As such, this article covers only salty black wines that cant be linked to anything else. Nevertheless, it is unclear if these wines should be the same or not.\nThe black-hued wine was strong-tasting and bitter, while it was customary to sprinkle on salt prior to every sip. As such, some thought it vile, but it had its enthusiasts.\nIn Ravens Bluff, the Cult of the Raven shared a communal cup of salty black wine during their ceremonies, calling the Blood of the Raven. They believed it granted the most favored among them dream visions from the Raven whom they revered.\n* Ruldarr, proprietor of Ruldarrs Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture in Bargewright Inn, who had a taste for it."
