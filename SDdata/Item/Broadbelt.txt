The '''broadbelt''' or '''broad belt''' was a kind of clothing accessory that overlapped with [[belt]]s and [[girdle]]s in a way that combined utility with fashion.

==Description==
Broadbelts were large and heavy belts worn about the waist, and covered much of the midsection thanks to the inherent broadness. A solid broadbelt was [[leather]] with [[metal]] reinforcement, and hooks, studs, spikes, and holes that added protection and attachment points for other accessories, tools, and weapons. More decorative belts functioned as jewelry first and could be decorated with precious metals like [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[platinum]].

When combined with an armored [[loin guard]] and [[bustier]], the full outfit functioned as a skin-baring and highly ornamental piece of armor that provided at least a little protection,

When sufficiently tightened, the belt compressed the innards and functioned as a lifting belt, protecting the wearer from injury while lifting great weights.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered an ornamented broadbelt for 6 [[gp]], [[dye]]d black or brown. The belt was sourced from [[Boom's Garden]] and was able to be combined with their loin guard and bustier, and had a twistable buckle that tightened the belt.
