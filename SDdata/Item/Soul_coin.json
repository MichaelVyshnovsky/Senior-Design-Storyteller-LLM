        "mainbody": "Soul coins were magical coins and the currency of the Nine Hells.\nA soul coin was made from a special type of iron called infernal iron. They were large coins, measuring  in width and  in thickness. They usually weighed about . Both sides of the coin had infernal script etched onto its surface.\nEach soul coin was infused with the soul of a single creature. The soul was tormented and filled with despair. As a result, any creature of a non-evil alignment was only able to carry a few coins at a time. A creature of an evil alignment was able to carry as many coins as they wished.\nA creature in possession of a soul coin could use its innate powers. The coin could be used to drain the life of a target creature. Another ability was that the soul inside the coin could be communicated with telepathically. It would answer questions but often gave vague answers.\nIt was possible to release the soul within a soul coin. This could be achieved by casting an anti-curse spell, such as remove curse, on the coin. Once a soul was freed, the coin began rusting and was eventually destroyed. If the soul was of a good alignment, they were transported to the realm of their deity. If the soul was of an evil alignment, they were transported to the Styx and transformed into a lemure.\nSoul coins were minted on Minauros by Mammon. Trapped souls were infused into the coins by his greater devils and then distributed throughout the Nine Hells."
