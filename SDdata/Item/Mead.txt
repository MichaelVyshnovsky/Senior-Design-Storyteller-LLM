Mead was a slightly sweet alcoholic beverage made of fermented honey. It was commonly brewed in the Northlands. Mead from the gardens of Neverwinter was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Mead was considerably rarer and more difficult to produce than wine, due to its slow fermentation and its sensitivity to temperature and the amount of yeast. When successfully brewed, it resulted in a delicate and sweet beverage.
