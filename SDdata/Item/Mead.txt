'''Mead''' was a slightly sweet alcoholic beverage made of fermented honey. It was commonly brewed in the [[North Faer√ªn|Northlands]]. Mead from the gardens of [[Neverwinter]] was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

{{quote|''[[Akabar Bel Akash|Akabar]] took another swig of the drink [[Olive Ruskettle|Olive]] offered and made a face. "Is this a healing draught?" Olive shook the flask and giggled. "Some call it that. It's spiked honey mead. Last of my stock, too." Akabar felt his empty stomach rise, then settle. So much for the halfling's skill as a nurse.''}}

==Description==
Mead was considerably rarer and more difficult to produce than [[wine]], due to its slow fermentation and its sensitivity to temperature and the amount of yeast. When successfully brewed, it resulted in a delicate and sweet beverage.
