Jassal was an expensive perfume with peculiar properties found in the Realms.
Jassal appeared as a translucent blue-green alcohol. It exuded the smell of ripe cherries, and when applied briefly chilled the skin (from alcohol evaporation) before turning clear and imparting a subtle, wafting cherry scent to the wearer for about six hours.
In addition to its use as a pleasant perfume, jassal found an appreciation with the church of Loviatar, who came to use it in many rituals. They discovered that if someone was drenched in jassal and then lashed with a whip, it would create an intense burning sensation across the body and heal all minor wounds, scratches, and bruises on their person. It would also produce a loud cracking sound on impact, and exuded a strong burst of cherry scent even if the perfume had already faded to almost nothing.
The recipe for jassal was believed to involve alcohol, cherries, and more secret ingredients, but it actually consisted of alcohol and the distilled roots of thistles, nettles, and three flowering weeds.
