        "mainbody": "'''''Dimensional shackles''''' were [[magic item|magical]] [[manacles|shackles]] that not only restricted movement, but also prevented extradimensional displacement.",
        "Description": "The shackles automatically adjusted to fit creatures of several different sizes, ranging from [[halfling]]s to [[ogre]]s.",
        "Powers": "A creature bound with ''dimensional shackles'' was incapable of any sort of extradimensional travel, be it ''[[teleport]]ing'' within the same [[Cosmology|plane]] or traveling to a different plane. Travel through preexisting ''[[portal]]s'' was still possible, however.\n\nAlthough it was possible to break free from ''dimensional shackles'', it was extremely difficult. It was only possible to attempt to break free from them once every 30 days.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Baazit]], an [[ultroloth]] that was imprisoned by a [[pit fiend]] in the [[Pit of Shummrath]] in [[Avernus]] for stealing ''[[soul coin]]s'', was also bound by ''dimensional shackles''."
