        "mainbody": "'''''Gauntlets of Necromancy''''' were a macabre pair of magic [[gauntlets]] used by the [[necromancer]] [[drow]] of [[House Freth]].",
        "Description": "''Gauntlets of necromancy'' were crafted out of tanned [[human]] skin then decorated and reinforced with human bones.",
        "Powers": "''Gauntlets of necromancy'' were fashioned to aid necromancers in creating and taming [[undead]]. They noticeably improved the wearer's wisdom and improved their resistance to mind-affecting spells and abilities. Additionally, the ''gauntlets of necromancy'' gave the wearers the ability to cast the ''[[halt undead]]'' spell at a high magical proficiency level, and granted significant defense against attacks made by all undead creatures.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], a pair of ''gauntlets of necromancy'' was left on a table in a room full of [[mohrg]]s alongside with some ''[[salve of undead repair]]'' deep in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in [[Myth Drannor]]. The deeper levels were taken over by the competing operations of two draw houses: [[House Freth]] that looted ancient elven hero tombs, and [[House Kilsek]] that was briefly allied with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] before the sudden but inevitable betrayal. The gauntlets were used by the House Freth wizards to halt the ancient undead, letting them easily loot the ruined catacombs."
