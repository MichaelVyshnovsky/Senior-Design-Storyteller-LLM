        "mainbody": "Gauntlets of Necromancy were a macabre pair of magic gauntlets used by the necromancer drow of House Freth.\nGauntlets of necromancy were crafted out of tanned human skin then decorated and reinforced with human bones.\nGauntlets of necromancy were fashioned to aid necromancers in creating and taming undead. They noticeably improved the wearers wisdom and improved their resistance to mind-affecting spells and abilities. Additionally, the gauntlets of necromancy gave the wearers the ability to cast the halt undead spell at a high magical proficiency level, and granted significant defense against attacks made by all undead creatures.\nIn 1369 DR, a pair of gauntlets of necromancy was left on a table in a room full of mohrgs alongside with some salve of undead repair deep in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor in Myth Drannor. The deeper levels were taken over by the competing operations of two draw houses House Freth that looted ancient elven hero tombs, and House Kilsek that was briefly allied with the Cult of the Dragon before the sudden but inevitable betrayal. The gauntlets were used by the House Freth wizards to halt the ancient undead, letting them easily loot the ruined catacombs."
