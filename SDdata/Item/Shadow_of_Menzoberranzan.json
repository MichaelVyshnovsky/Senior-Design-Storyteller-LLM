        "mainbody": "The '''''Shadow of Menzoberranzan''''' was an enchanted [[drow]] cowl that enveloped the wearer in darkness.",
        "Description": "The ''Shadow of Menzoberranzan'' was a delicate thin drow cowl and a mask. The ''Shadow'' was intricately decorated with elven designs. It radiated magic that called to the wearer, waiting to embrace them and wrap them in shadows.",
        "Powers": "The ''Shadow of Menzoberranzan'' gave the wearer the ability to become shrouded in shadows, allowing them to become virtually undetectable in the darkness or shade.",
        "History": "In [[1492 DR]], ''Shadow of Menzoberranzan'' could be found on a corpse of a drow elf, hidden behind fungal growth inside a colony of the [[Underdark]] [[myconids]], in the vicinity of the [[Shattered Sanctum]]'s Underdark stronghold.\n\nDuring the same year, ''Shadow of Menzoberranzan'' was among the powerful enchanted items with a rich concentration of the ''[[weave]]'' strands, sought by [[Gale]], in order to satiate the ravenous orb of [[Netherese]] ''[[Shadow Weave]]'' that became a part of his being. This condition forced the [[wizard]] to consume [[magical item]]s to stave off disaster."
