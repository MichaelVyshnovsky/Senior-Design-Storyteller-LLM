        "mainbody": "The Shadow of Menzoberranzan was an enchanted drow cowl that enveloped the wearer in darkness.\nThe Shadow of Menzoberranzan was a delicate thin drow cowl and a mask. The Shadow was intricately decorated with elven designs. It radiated magic that called to the wearer, waiting to embrace them and wrap them in shadows.\nThe Shadow of Menzoberranzan gave the wearer the ability to become shrouded in shadows, allowing them to become virtually undetectable in the darkness or shade.\nIn 1492 DR, Shadow of Menzoberranzan could be found on a corpse of a drow elf, hidden behind fungal growth inside a colony of the Underdark myconids, in the vicinity of the Shattered Sanctums Underdark stronghold.\nDuring the same year, Shadow of Menzoberranzan was among the powerful enchanted items with a rich concentration of the weave strands, sought by Gale, in order to satiate the ravenous orb of Netherese Shadow Weave that became a part of his being. This condition forced the wizard to consume magical items to stave off disaster."
