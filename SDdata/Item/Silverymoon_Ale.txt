Silverymoon Ale was a variety of hearty bodied ale from just outside of the northern city of Silverymoon, served at the Silvermoon Playhouse of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
Despite the name "Silverymoon Ale," the drink was not produced in the Gem of the North. In reality, it was brewed by a small dwarven community near Silverymoon.
