Disruption was a weapon quality that could be added to magical weapons. It could destroy undead outright.
Whenever an undead foe was struck with a disruption weapon, it had to successfully resist the effect with an effort of will or be destroyed instantly.
One who would enchant a disruption weapon had to have the heal spell available. The property could only be used on a bludgeoning weapon, such as a club or mace.
Some veteran Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of disruption.
