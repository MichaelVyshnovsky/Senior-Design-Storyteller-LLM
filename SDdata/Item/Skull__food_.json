        "mainbody": "Skulls were a traditional type of pastry from the nation of Chessenta in the Vilhon Reach.\nSkulls were named after their round shape and white sugar icing. These handfoods were small dough balls made with heavy cream, flour, eggs, and copious amounts of sugar. The balls were shaped and pinched at one spot to give them a rough but distinct skull-like shape. After cooking, skulls were covered in white icing.\nThese pastries were a traditional holiday treat in Chessenta during the annual Deadwinter Day celebration."
