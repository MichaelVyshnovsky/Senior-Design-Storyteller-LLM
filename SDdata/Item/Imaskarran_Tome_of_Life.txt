The '''Imaskarran Tome of Life''' was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to "Life". The book detailed the process of creating a [[ring of elemental resistance]] from a [[quartz]] crystal and a [[fenberry]], using the spell ''[[endure elements]]''.

[[Eltoora Sarptyl]] sought, maybe with the help of the [[Hero of Neverwinter]], this tome around [[Port Llast]]. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. It was in the possession of the [[lich]] Brother Tomas of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] of [[Illuskan]], having been interred with him.{{cite game/Neverwinter Nights}}
