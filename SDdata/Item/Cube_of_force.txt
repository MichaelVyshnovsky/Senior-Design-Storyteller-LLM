A cube of force was a magical item used to create barriers.
A cube of force measured  across each face. Each side had a unique design. They were made of either bone, ivory, or metal.
A cube was activated when an individual pressed on one side of the cube. Each cube held 36 magical charges and one was discharged when a side was pressed. When pressed, a magical barrier  wide per side was created, centered on the individual, with each side of the cube creating a barrier with different properties. The barrier remained in place for up to a minute or until deactivated.
