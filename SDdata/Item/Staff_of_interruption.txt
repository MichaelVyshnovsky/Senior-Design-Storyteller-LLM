'''''Staff of interruption''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] used to battle spellcasters and created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''SStaff of interruption'' possessed a potent ''+2'' enchantment that strengthened the [[weapon]]'s blows and aided the wielder's aim. The staff hummed with disruptive magical arcane that could be focused into a daily blast of ''[[counterspell]]'' magic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''staff of interruption'' belonged to [[Mayrina]] during her time with the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. She offered the magic weapon as a reward to adventurers brave enough to end the life of malicious [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] who laid under the [[Blushing Maiden Inn]].
