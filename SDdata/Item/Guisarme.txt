A '''guisarme''' ({{Pronounce|gwee|ZARM|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|26}}}}) was a two-handed, martial, melee weapon of the [[pole arm]] family.

==Description==
[[Image:Guisarme2.jpg|thumb|left|75px|Guisarme]]
The basic guisarme was a weaponized pruning hook mounted on a long pole. It might or might not have a back spike. The convex edge (outside curve) was sharpened for slicing all the way up to the point of the hook.

==Weaponology==
The guisarme was a pole arm so it required two hands to wield. Being a reach weapon, it was capable of striking targets as far away as {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. The hook might be used to attempt to trip an enemy or pull a rider off a mount. The back spike could be used for parrying or for a sideways swinging attack, but the guisarme was primarily an offensive slashing weapon. This weapon required training to use and was classified as a martial weapon.
