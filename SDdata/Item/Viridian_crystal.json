        "mainbody": "Viridian crystals, colloquially known as fools emeralds, was a crystal found in the Underdark and underground locations in the Western Heartlands.\nViridian crystals were known for being hard to work with because of their brittleness. Its crystalline form was sharp-edged.\nEven though sometimes used for decoration and crafting, fools emeralds had some alchemical properties. These crystals could be transformed via alchemy into salts of viridian crystal that had arcane symbols appear and dissolve in its grains. This substance was mixed with a special vitriol to create a diluted variant of the oil of sharpness."
