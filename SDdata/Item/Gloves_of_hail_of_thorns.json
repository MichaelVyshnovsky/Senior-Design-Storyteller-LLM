        "mainbody": "Gloves of hail of thorns were enchanted gloves that gave their wearers access to offensive magics.\nThese leather gloves were decorated with thirty superficial scrapes, six at the base of each finger.\nThe wearer was granted the ability to cast the hail of thorns spell once per rest of at least four hours.\nIn 1492 DR, Derryth Bonecloak, a herbalist from Baldurs Gate, owned a pair of these magical gloves. She, alongside her feeblemind affected husband, traveled from the Gray Harbor to a friendly myconid colony in Underdark to search for cure-all mushrooms called noblestalks. Another pair belonged to a Zhentarim smuggler merchant named Brem, who operated from a hideout underneath Waukeens Rest in the Western Heartlands. He offered the gloves as a reward for retiring a valuable shipment lost in a gnoll attack on the Risen Road."
