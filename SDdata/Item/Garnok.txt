An '''garnok''' was a type of blowpipe used by [[Angulutiun]] and [[Iulutiun]] hunters.

==Description==
A garnok was a rod made from bone that was about {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} in length. It featured a leather thong at one end and a small cup at the other. It was employed for propelling small bone darts, typically measuring {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} or less in length.
