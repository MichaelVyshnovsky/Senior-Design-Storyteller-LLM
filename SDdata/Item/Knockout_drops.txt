Zakharan knockout drops was a potent quick-acting elixir similar in its effects to the potion of sleep, often used for medicinal purposes.
These knockout drops were luscious red in color and tasted bitter.
Knockout drops was a potent drug that took only a few drops mixed with any food or liquid to momentarily knock someone out cold into a state of deep sleep.
The exact recipe was well guarded by the physicians of Zakhara, but it was known that the elixir was prepared using animal fats, prunes, oranges, sugar, and salt. These ingredients were mixed into a thick syrup that easily dissolved in water, olive oil, or alcohol.
Originally developed by Zakharan physicians as a strong and quick acting cure for insomnia, the elixir quickly found its way into the hands of various criminal elements across many neighboring regions.
In 1372 DR knockout drops from Zakhara found their way into the inventory of a roguish black-market trader and a fence named Stran of Daggerford. He advertised the exotic potion eagerly, it being almost unheard of in this part of the Realms.
