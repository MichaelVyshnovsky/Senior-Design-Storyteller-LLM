'''''Zakharan knockout drops''''' was a potent quick-acting elixir similar in its effects to the ''[[potion of sleep]]'', often used for medicinal purposes.

==Description==
These ''knockout drops'' were luscious red in color and tasted bitter.

==Powers==
''Knockout drops'' was a potent drug that took only a few drops mixed with any food or liquid to momentarily knock someone out cold into a state of deep sleep.

==Preparation==
The exact recipe was well guarded by the physicians of Zakhara, but it was known that the elixir was prepared using animal fats, [[prune]]s, [[orange]]s, [[sugar]], and [[salt]]. These ingredients were mixed into a thick syrup that easily dissolved in water, [[olive oil]], or alcohol.

==History==
Originally developed by Zakharan physicians as a strong and quick acting cure for insomnia, the elixir quickly found its way into the hands of various criminal elements across many neighboring regions.

In [[1372 DR]] ''knockout drops'' from Zakhara found their way into the inventory of a roguish black-market trader and a fence named [[Stran]] of [[Daggerford]]. He advertised the exotic potion eagerly, it being almost unheard of in this part of the Realms.
