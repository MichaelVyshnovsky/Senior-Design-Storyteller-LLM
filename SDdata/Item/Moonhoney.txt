'''Moonhoney''' was made from the [[feces]] of ground-dwelling worms that dwelt in the [[Abyss]].

==Description==
Its color and consistency resembled that of [[honey]], but with a smoky taste. When exposed to moonlight, it developed a temporary sweet flavor that was highly prized by [[human]]s and many [[demihuman]]s. Moonhoney didn't spoil so it was ideal travel food. When swallowed, it would cure any [[poison]] in a person's system.
