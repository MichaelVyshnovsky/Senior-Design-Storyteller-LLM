'''Acid''' was a caustic liquid and possible death. The fumes of most acids were [[poison]]ous to breathe. Certain creatures, perhaps most notably [[black dragon]]s, were known to spray or "breathe" acid from their mouths.

Acidic liquids were typically created by spellcasters with training in [[alchemy]] and sold by [[alchemist]]s. A {{SIAdj|1|lb}} [[vial]] or [[flask]] of acid, suitable for throwing as a weapon, could be purchased for about 10 [[gp|gold pieces]] or as much as 25. A shattering flask or vial of acid could splash as far as {{SI|5|ft}}.

Acid was a component in many spells, such as ''[[acid storm]]'',  ''[[acid bolt]]'',  or ''[[venomfire]]''. [[Magic weapon]]s could be imbued with the [[acidic burst]] property to make them more damaging.

==History==
The [[Do'Urden]] patron and weapon master, [[Zaknafein]], while transformed into a [[Zin-carla]], willingly fell into a pit of acid to prevent himself from murdering his son, [[Drizzt]]. In this battle, [[Guenhwyvar]], Drizzt's magical panther, also fell into the same chasm, but, escaping and healing in the [[Astral Plane]], Guenhwyvar made a full recovery.<ref>
