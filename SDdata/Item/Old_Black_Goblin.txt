'''Old Black Goblin''' was an expensive and exclusive type of [[porter]] served in clubs of [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]].

==Description==
This black-colored porter was brewed with [[cherrywood]] ash [[licorice]] root. Kegs of Old Black Goblin were branded with a "hunched-black-stick-figure" image.

This drink was an extremely rare commodity, found only in the most exclusive clubs for the rich and noble. Old Black Goblin's production was shrouded in secrecy. Its several well-hidden breweries were located somewhere in the backcountry of [[Interior Faer√ªn]], and the recipe itself was rumored to be kept under lock and key by a noble house. The noble family's name was a secret as well, with only one clue being them growing wealthy in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] through sales of Old Black Goblin.
