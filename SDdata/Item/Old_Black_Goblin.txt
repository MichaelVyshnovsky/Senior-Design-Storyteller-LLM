Old Black Goblin was an expensive and exclusive type of porter served in clubs of Cormyr and Sembia.
This black-colored porter was brewed with cherrywood ash licorice root. Kegs of Old Black Goblin were branded with a "hunched-black-stick-figure" image.
This drink was an extremely rare commodity, found only in the most exclusive clubs for the rich and noble. Old Black Goblins production was shrouded in secrecy. Its several well-hidden breweries were located somewhere in the backcountry of Interior Faer√ªn, and the recipe itself was rumored to be kept under lock and key by a noble house. The noble familys name was a secret as well, with only one clue being them growing wealthy in the late 14 century DR through sales of Old Black Goblin.
