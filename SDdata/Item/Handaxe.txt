}}'''Handaxes''' were a type of light, martial melee weapon in the [[axe]] family.

==Description==
Handaxes were similar to ''hatchets'' in size and shape. Their shafts were usually made of wood, though metal was sometimes used. Their blades were single-edged and their back sides were either unadorned, spiked, or had a peen. Handaxes were heavier than [[throwing axe]]s and not balanced enough to be used effectively as a thrown weapon.

==Weaponology==
Classified as a light weapon, handaxes were often used while grappling an opponent. Because some training was required to use them effectively as an off-hand weapon in conjunction with another, they were typically considered as martial weapons.

==Notable Handaxes==
* ''[[Sky Cleaver]]'', the legendary handaxe of the [[giant pantheon|giant god]] [[Annam All-Father]].
* ''[[Snowbeard's avalanche axe]]''
