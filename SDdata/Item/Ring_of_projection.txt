A '''''ring of projection''''' was a magical ring that aided in all manner of throwing- and launching-related tasks.

==Description==
The ring appeared as a plain and unremarkable [[brass]] ring.

==Powers==
The ring allowed the wearer to throw an object (weapon or otherwise) three times the normal distance, while missiles launched or fired by the wearer also had their potential range tripled. The speed of the augmented missile was dramatically increased, inflicting additional damage on impact and reaching a far more distant target in the same time as a closer, mundane shot. This power did not require anything more than intent to activate, though placing distant shots on-target did still require practice and care to aim properly. 

A less-obvious quality of the ring caused a small pocket of air to be carried along with the launched munition, allowing it to carry air to submerged beings or allow an incendiary missile to remain lit when it would otherwise be extinguished due to wind or water.

A secondary power could be activated by speaking a [[command word]] engraved on the inner side of the band. The wearer could imbue themselves or someone else they touched with the enhancements of ''[[jump]]'' for a single leap. This power could only be given to a single target at a time, but did allow them to jump great distances while carrying a heavy load. All of the ring's powers became inactive for a few seconds after each time ''jump'' was used.
