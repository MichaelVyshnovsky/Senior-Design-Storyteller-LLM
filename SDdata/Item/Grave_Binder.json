        "mainbody": "The Grave Binder, also known as Longtooth, was an enchanted dagger found across many locations on the Sword Coast during the late 13 and 14 centuries DR.\nThe Grave Binder and other Longtooth daggers were quite rare but were easily identifiable by their unusually long blades.\nLongtooths were ensorcelled with a simple +2 enchantment that guided the wielders hand towards the target and increased the weapons damage.\nThese daggers were known to exist as early as the late 13 century DR. In the , one such dagger was stashed away in caves within the Wyrms Tooth glacier claimed by a tribe of frost giant.\nMother such dagger was uncovered several years before the  by a band of adventurers in south Faerûn. However, the owners of the weapon remained oblivious to its magics for years after the discovery. Subsequently, the adventurers delved into lore tomes and rediscovered the weapons enchantment and extensive history in the hands of assassins. This led to the dagger being renamed the Grave Binder. However, soon after, the Binder was stolen and found its way to northwest Faerûn.\nIn 1368 DR, a Grave Binder, or possibly the Grave Binder, ended up in the hands of the assassin only known as Krystin from Baldurs Gates Undercellar. She was hired by the infamous Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev to end the life of his brother Abdel Adrian."
