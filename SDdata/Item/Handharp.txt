A handharp was a rare magical musical instrument favored by traveling Harpers. In fact, these items were believed to have been initially crafted by traveling Harpers.
Handharps were wooden crescent-shaped instruments about the size of a mans hand. They were strung with enchanted metal strings.
The magical properties of these items could be used by anyone capable of playing a tune. When played, a handharp created four blue globes of light that behaved like the dancing lights spell. The person playing the handharp could direct these globes with passive concentration.
The magic of a handharp affected all undead within a  radius of the instrument, making it more difficult for them to strike and harm targets. Life-draining attacks from undead were also easier to resist within this radius. The magic also prevented any creature within the radius from being charmed. Any charmed creature walking into the radius would be stunned for as long as they remained near the handharp.
Once per day a handharp could be used to open a dimension door that could transport a single living target up to  away. This was activated by plucking a specific string while singing a specific note. Using this power prevented a handharps other magic from functioning for ten minutes.
If carried by a bard, the area of effect for all of the handharps magic was doubled, including the distance the dimension door could transport the user.
