'''''Shining Light''''' was a rare variety of [[enchanted]] [[shuriken]] from [[Kara-Tur]].

==Powers==
Each of these sharp thrown disks was enhanced with a ''+2'' enchantment that, upon striking a target, had a coin-toss of a chance to daze a creature for twelve seconds.

==History==
Many years before [[1372 DR]], a member of the [[Iron Order]] named [[Vilaneux]] was caught in a hurricane and ended up washed ashore in a faraway strange and then unexplored land of [[Kara-Tur]]. For the locals, Vilaneux's enchanted [[plate armor]] was an oddity and quickly became well recognized. Eventually, he gained fame and the love of the locals after serving justice and defending the weak. His renown was so great that after his death, his magic armor was flattened and cut into the first ''Shining Light'' shurikens as a tribute.

By [[1372 DR]], some of these enchanted exotic thrown weapons had reached the [[Sword Coast]] and the city of [[Neverwinter]].
