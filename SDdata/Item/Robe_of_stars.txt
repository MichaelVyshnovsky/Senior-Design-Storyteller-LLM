A robe of stars was a magical robe that offered a spellcaster significant physical protection along with a variety of other magical powers. 
These robes were often woven with dark blue or black fabric and decorated with embroidery of silvery stars or runes.
In addition to offering defense against magical effects along with physical protection, in some cases in a manner similar to a suit of leather armor,  a robe of stars allowed its wearer to readily travel to the Astral Plane.
Up to six of the embroidered stars on the robe could be removed and either thrown in a manner similar to shuriken, or released as magic missiles. A number of these stars reappeared on the robe each day at dusk.
Some of these robes were capable of producing extremely bright light and would never get dirty or wet.
