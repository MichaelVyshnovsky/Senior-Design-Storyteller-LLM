        "mainbody": "Old Omuan was a script developed and used by the people of Omu in Chult.\nThe script used jagged cuneiform characters that bore little resemblance to any other known alphabet. Even Omus neighbors and rivals on the Chultan Peninsula could not read it.\nOld Omuan was used by the people of Omu from ancient times until the destruction of their city in the 14 century DR. \nFormal proclamations were etched in concentric rings onto circular stone tablets, and would need to be written in both Old Omuan and an additional language when Omus rivals were intended to understand the message, as was the case for a declaration to the Mezroans by the citys last ruler&mdashQueen Napaka&mdashthat Omu remained strong.\nInscriptions written in Old Omuan adorned sites like Nangalore, and the Tomb of the Nine Gods.\nBy the late 15 century DR, few except trained scholars or sages could decode Old Omuan inscriptions without the help of an already translated text for reference. As such, spells like comprehend languages were otherwise necessary to read it."
