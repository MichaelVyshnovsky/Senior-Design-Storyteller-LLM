Brackleberry was the term Cormyreans used to describe any jam made with mixed berries from the wilderness.
The base for these jams was typically a mixture of gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, or currants. These berries were leavened with overripe peaches or quinces and packed in sugar.
Brackleberry jams were imported into Cormyr from warmer countries such as Chessenta.
