A '''''robe of many sigils''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] robe that allowed its wearer to cast certain [[spell]]s as if they were doing so from an [[arcane]] [[scroll]].{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|4}}

==Description==
The black fabric of the robe was inscribed with interwoven [[mithral]] threads in the shape of [[rune]]s and sigils. These inscriptions allowed the wearer of the robes to cast the spells associated with their symbols. A robe could contain 10 such sigils, which would be consumed upon casting. Each time this was done a new rune or sigil could be woven in the previous symbol's place.

In addition to granting the wearer additional spellcasting capabilities, it allowed them to cast ''[[read magic]]'' three times per day.

==Creation==
The sigils on these robes could be inscribed by skilled weavers who were capable of scribing scrolls.
