        "Design": "The tube itself was a foot-long cylinder two inches in diameter. It consisted of two parts, with one end covered by a metal cap.\n\nA disk was inserted in the tube, which had been enchanted by [[Histra]], a priestess of [[Sune]], with a dweomer of light as bright as pure sunlight.",
        "Use": "The metal cap on the tube shielded the light. When popped off, a focused beam of light was projected. The light beam can be adjusted by a twist of the upper part of the cylinder.<ref>"
