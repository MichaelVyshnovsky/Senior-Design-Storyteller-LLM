It consisted of two parts, with one end covered by a metal cap.\nA disk was inserted in the tube, which had been enchanted by Histra, a priestess of Sune, with a dweomer of light as bright as pure sunlight.\nThe metal cap on the tube shielded the light. When popped off, a focused beam of light was projected. The light beam can be adjusted by a twist of the upper part of the cylinder."
