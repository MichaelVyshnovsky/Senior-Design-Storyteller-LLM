        "Availability": "On the [[Sword Coast North]], medicines, [[wine]]s, and cordials were produced by the monks of [[Goldenfields]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. In the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[The Blade and Stars]] inn served a sweet and thick cordial – a mixture of [[cherries]] liquified in dessert red wine. In [[Sundabar]], [[firestar wine]] from [[The Firestar Chariot]], was a concoction of amber [[sherry]] and ruby cordial.\n\nCordials and brandies were available from [[Toss Your Tankard]] in [[Harrowdale]] and from [[I Shot an Arrow]] in [[Arrowmark]] of the [[Dalelands]].\n\nIn the kingdom of [[Cormyr]], namely in [[Arabel]], [[Marsember]], and [[Suzail]], producers of medicinal cordials and physics were taxed same as producers of other alcoholic beverages, or \"strong drinks.\"{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}\n\nPeople of [[Sembia]] preferred to consume their [[coffee]] mixed with melted [[chocolate]] and flavored with cordials or liquors.\n\nThe [[Purple Lady]] of [[Westgate]] and its Lady of the House [[Ambra Indreth]] were known to serve [[tea]]s and cordials to their guests.\n\nIn the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], medicinal fiery cordials were sold by [[Rare and Fine Seashell Remedies]] of the [[Seaglimpse]] Neighborhood. [[Rose's Tea Room]], [[The Black Lotus]], and the [[Fruits & More]] establishments in Ravens Bluff also offered a variety of cordials. The so-called [[Essence of Dryad]] drink claimed to be made using a pulp of a [[tree]] and a [[dryad]] who inhabited it, but in reality was a dryad-made cordial.{{Cite organized play/LC/Monster Mash|8}} And as of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the drink known as the [[Moonmint Cordial]] created by [[Rapheira Skyhawk]] was gaining popularity in the Living City.\n\nIn [[West Faerûn]], cordials were popular in the nation of [[Tethyr]]. [[The Yardarm]] in [[Velen]] had a wide variety of cordial on offer, as well at the [[Stag Triumphant]] in [[Mosstone]].\n\n[[Ruby]]-red [[brissberry]] cordials were a popular libation in the land of [[Halruaa]] in the [[Shining South]] and in the town of [[Ashtarahh]].\n\n[[Drow]] of the [[Underdark]] distilled strong cordials from various fermented subterranean [[mushroom]]s. Some drow cordials were exported out of the drow lands to the surface nations."
