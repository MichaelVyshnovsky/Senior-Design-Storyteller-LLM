The '''''Wand of Ochalor's Eye''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[wand]] that functioned in a similar manner to a ''[[wand of fear]]''.

==Description==
These magic wands were topped with an orange [[gemstone]] that outlasted with glow, sometimes referred to as ''Ochalor’s Eye'', or ''The Eye of Fear''.

==Powers==
Each pulse of orange light radiated a cone of immensely powerful ''[[fear]]'' spell that affected all creatures that were caught in its gaze. Affected individuals shuddered with fear, dropped anything they carried, and became paralyzed by magical terror, staring into the wand's gem. The gem's effect's remained active unless the gem was moved from the victim's eyesight or the victim was stricken or damaged. When either of these things happened, a magical trance was broken, and the affected individuals fled screaming interior. The fearsome magics of the ''Wand of Ochalor's Eye'' were surely to affect weaker creatures while the more powerful ones had a chance of resisting its mesmerizing glow.

==History==
Many stories surrounded the ''Wand of Ochalor's Eye''. Some said that those who looked into the ''The Eye of Fear'' saw repeatedly replayed phantasmal images of their death. In contrast, others claimed that the gem held some unknowable alien intelligence that knew all darkest secrets mocked those affected by the wand. One thing was known for sure: those affected by ''Ochalor’s Eye'' did not remember much of the wand's magics,  yet they remembered the feelings of fear and hatred. Some survivors gained compulsory contempt of these wands, feeling an unbearable drive to destroy them on sight.
