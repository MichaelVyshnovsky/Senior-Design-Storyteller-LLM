Shederran longbows were weapons mastefully crafted by the best bowyers of Neverwinter sometime circa the late 14 century DR.
Shederran longbows wood had a notable pale green color. The strong wood had tensile properties that allowed the strongest of warriors to exert their full strength on the bow, adding their own strength to the already powerful attack.
Aryvindaire, a wood elven leader of a group that inhabited Neverwinter Wood in the late 14 century DR, carried a stock of masterfully-crafted Shederran longbows.
