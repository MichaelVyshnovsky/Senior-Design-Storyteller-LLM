A decanter of endless lamp oil was a magical flask that could produce streams of oil.
These decanter operated similarly to the more well-known decanter of endless water.
Circa 1270 DR, in an elaborate ritual to summon Kossuths avatar, the high priest of the Kossuthan temple Flaming Brazier in Bezantur attempted to douse the Alamber Sea with a decanter of endless lamp oil and then ignite it.
