A '''''decanter of endless lamp oil''''' was a [[magic]]al flask that could produce streams of [[oil]].

==Powers==
These decanter operated similarly to the more well-known ''[[decanter of endless water]]''.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1270 DR]], in an elaborate ritual to summon [[Kossuth]]'s [[avatar]], the high [[priest]] of the [[Kossuthan]] temple [[Flaming Brazier (Bezantur)|Flaming Brazier]] in [[Bezantur]] attempted to douse the Alamber Sea with a ''[[decanter of endless lamp oil]]'' and then ignite it.
