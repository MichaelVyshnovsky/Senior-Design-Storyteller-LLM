The naga crowns were powerful major artifacts that gave their wearers the power to completely control reptiles. They were actually made by the yuan-ti.
They were triple-spired, silvery metal circlets.
The wearer of a naga crown could see through invisibility.
They could also create a magical energy sphere to prevent creatures from coming closer and to reflect spells back to the original caster.
Furthermore, if the bearer was an arcane spellcaster, their daily spell allotment was doubled.
