Sorlyns Ditty was an enchanted flute created as a gift for Sorlyn Sheerla, a cleric of Milil in Amn sometime before 1374 DR.
This magical instrument allowed the individual playing it to cast the cure moderate wounds and the sound burst spell once per day.
Sorlyn Sheerla received the original and significantly more powerful version of Sorlyns Ditty as a Midsummer gift. Being a teacher at a bardic college in Amn, she decided to order several dozen copies of the flute created to be given out to the best students as a gift of recognition. She quickly realized that creating an exact copy would be far too expensive, and the resulting copies were of significantly lesser power. Sorlyn Sheerla did not think that was much of an issue as she believed that any prize student of hers would keep out of trouble in any event.
In the , one of Sorlyns Ditties found its way into a wizardly cabal in the Tempests Fury of Samarach.
