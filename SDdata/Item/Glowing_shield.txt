A glowing shield was a type of magical shield that could be found within the Sword Coast circa the late 15 century DR.
The bearer of this shield heard subtle and encouraging whispers in some long-lost language, making them feel safe and well-protected.
In addition to the physical protection offered by a glowing shield, its bearer was enveloped in a loving protection whenever they were seriously wounded in battle, the shield offered them increased vigor and vitality for a limited duration.
