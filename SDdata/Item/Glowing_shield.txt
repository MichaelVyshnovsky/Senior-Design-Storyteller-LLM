A '''''glowing shield''''' was a type of [[magic]]al [[shield]] that could be found within the [[Sword Coast]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The bearer of this shield heard subtle and encouraging whispers in some long-lost language, making them feel safe and well-protected.

==Powers==
In addition to the physical protection offered by a ''glowing shield'', its bearer was enveloped in a ''loving protection'': whenever they were seriously wounded in battle, the shield offered them increased vigor and vitality for a limited duration.

==Notable Owners==
* Councilor [[Florrick]], an important figure in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
