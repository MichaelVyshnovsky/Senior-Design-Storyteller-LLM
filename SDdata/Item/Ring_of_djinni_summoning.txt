A ring of djinni summoning, also sometimes called ring of djinni calling, or simply djinn ring, was a variant of a ring of genie summoning from Zakhara, more common in Faer√ªn, that could summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air.
When activated via rubbing, The ring would lose its magic if the djinni associated with it died.
