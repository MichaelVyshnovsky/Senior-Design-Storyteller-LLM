'''''Hellfire weapons''''' were vicious weapons found in the [[Nine Hells]].

==Desciption==
Hellfire weapons were any weapon made from a special type of iron called ''[[infernal iron]]'' and then forged in [[hellfire]]. As a result of this process, the weapon was suffused with brilliant veins of hellfire. The faint light from the weapon illuminated the surrounding area in a {{SI|5|ft}} radius.

==Powers==
When a creature was killed with a hellfire weapon, their soul was instantly sent to the [[Styx]]. As a result, the soul was transformed into a [[lemure]].
