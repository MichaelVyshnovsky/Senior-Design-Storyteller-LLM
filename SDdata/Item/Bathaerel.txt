'''Bathaerel''', also known as '''rustbanish''', was a purplish powder made from rocks found in the [[Abyss]]al layers of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layers 45-47: Azzagrat|Rauwend]] and [[Layers of the Abyss#Layers 45-47: Azzagrat|Voorz'zt]].

==Powers==
When mixed with water, [[potato]]es, and green plants and placed in a bag with rusty metal items, it would remove the rust from the [[iron]], although it could not replace metal that had been already lost.
