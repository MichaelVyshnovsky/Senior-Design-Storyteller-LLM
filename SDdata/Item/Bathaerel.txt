Bathaerel, also known as rustbanish, was a purplish powder made from rocks found in the Abyssal layers of Rauwend and Voorzzt.
When mixed with water, potatoes, and green plants and placed in a bag with rusty metal items, it would remove the rust from the iron, although it could not replace metal that had been already lost.
