        "mainbody": "'''White Lightning''' was a strong alcoholic drink served at the rowdy [[Jack Jaw]] tavern in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The White Lightning drink was created sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR and served exclusively at the Jack Jaw, or \"Da Jaaaaw,\" as locals called it. One of the Jaw's bouncers, the insane [[dwarf]] named [[Quillion]], developed a weakness for White Lightning. The drink was strong enough to get a tough dwarf like him drunk after only fifteen tankards."
