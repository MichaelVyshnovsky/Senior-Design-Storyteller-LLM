Krilluss Blazer was a magical lantern.
Krilluss Blazer was a modest brass lantern, square in shape with shutters on one side. The brass fixtures of the lantern consistently appeared freshly polished. Suspended by magical means above the oil receptacle was a brass ball, which was not physically attached to the lantern in any way.
If a creature touched the ball, they received an electric shock, risking paralyzation or unconsciousness. The oil receptacle held enough oil to last for two hours, although the lantern need not be lit for its magical properties to function.
When the lantern was grasped by any creature, it telepathically communicated its powers to the holder but was unable to convey any other information. The lantern possessed two functions, both related to electricity.
The first function of Krilluss Blazer was to release a stunning wave of electricity. This wave had a 180Â° arc of effect, impacting every creature within  of the lantern with a power similar to a limited power word, stun spell. The effect followed the spell exactly, except that it lasted for only half the normal duration. This power could be used once per day.
The second function of the lantern was its ability to create up to ten lightning bolts. The power of each bolt was determined by the holder. Each bolt could strike only one creature or object. If all charges were not used within one hour of casting the first bolt, the remaining charges were lost. This power could also be used once per day.
