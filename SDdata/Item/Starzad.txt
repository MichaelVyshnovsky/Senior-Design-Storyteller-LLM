'''''Starzad''''' was a ''[[vorpal]]'' [[scimitar]].

==Powers==
As a ''vorpal'' weapon, ''Starzad'' was especially suited for beheading opponents.

==History==
''Starzad'' was forged by a [[genie]] in the [[Zakhara]]n city of [[Qudra]]. The scimitar was acquired by the [[sha'ir]] [[Tejan ibn-Dhabar]], who carried it with him on his travels through the elemental [[Cosmology|planes]]. Tejan eventually transformed himself into a [[water elemental]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. Just before doing so, he sent ''Starzad'' to a former colleague. Said colleague eventually became a member of the [[Doomguard]] in [[Sigil]],{{Cite dungeon/60/Nemesis|33}}

The scimitar was eventually stolen on behalf of the [[marilith]] [[Kaliva]], who sought powerful swords to help her defeat her old mentor.
