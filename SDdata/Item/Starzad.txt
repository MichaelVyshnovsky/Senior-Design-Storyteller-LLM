Starzad was a vorpal scimitar.
As a vorpal weapon, Starzad was especially suited for beheading opponents.
Starzad was forged by a genie in the Zakharan city of Qudra. The scimitar was acquired by the shair Tejan ibn-Dhabar, who carried it with him on his travels through the elemental planes. Tejan eventually transformed himself into a water elemental on the Elemental Plane of Water. Just before doing so, he sent Starzad to a former colleague. Said colleague eventually became a member of the Doomguard in Sigil,
The scimitar was eventually stolen on behalf of the marilith Kaliva, who sought powerful swords to help her defeat her old mentor.
