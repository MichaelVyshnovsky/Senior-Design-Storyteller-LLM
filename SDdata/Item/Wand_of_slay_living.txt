'''''Wands of slay living''''' were enchanted [[wand]]s, loaded with several charges of a spell extremely dangerous to living creatures.

==Description==
''Wands of slay living'' were crafted out of wand-shaped bone fragments.

==Powers==
These wands were imbued with several charges of the ''[[slay living]]'' spell. Each wand held three charges on average.

Curiously enough, the enchantments weaved onto these wands was very close to that of beneficial effects as an incomplete ''wand of slay living'' could be used to ''[[cure critical wounds]]'' instead of killing the living.

==History==
[[1369 DR]], several of these powerful wands were recovered from ancient elven tombs in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]s.
