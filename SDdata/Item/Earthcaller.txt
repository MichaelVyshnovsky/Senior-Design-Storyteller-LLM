'''''Earthcaller''''' was a heavy crystalline [[rod]] wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Segojan Earthcaller]].<ref name=frcs-3e-p240">

==Description==
This rod, which was effectively a [[heavy mace]],<ref name=frcs-3e-p240"/> was made of crystalline [[quartz]].

==Powers==
''Earthcaller'' had all the powers of a ''[[rod of smiting]]'' and had a pair of unique abilities. The heavy mace was able to create a powerful ''[[earthquake]]'' when it was struck against a surface, but only at the whim of the Lord of the Burrow. Its most unique ability was to summon a [[stone golem]] when pressed against a rock of at least {{SI|3000|lb|k}}. The stone golem would protect and serve Segojan Earthcaller for all of the day. These two powers could only be activated once per day, but seemed to have unlimited charges.
