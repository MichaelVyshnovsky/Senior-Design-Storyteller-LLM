The '''''Angry Coxswain Portal''''' was a [[magical]] ''[[portal]]'' located in [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The ''portal'' was located within the [[Angry Coxswain]]—a tavern located in the central section Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] along the waterfront where [[Odd Street]] joined [[Dock Street (Waterdeep)|Dock Street]].

==Powers==
The ''portal'' was keyed and only functioned in one direction—connecting to a slave pen in a market in [[Skuld]], [[Mulhorand]]. A pair of slavers from the Angry Coxswain used it to transport victims.
