The Angry Coxswain Portal was a magical portal located in Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The portal was located within the Angry Coxswain—a tavern located in the central section Waterdeeps Dock Ward along the waterfront where Odd Street joined Dock Street.
The portal was keyed and only functioned in one direction—connecting to a slave pen in a market in Skuld, Mulhorand. A pair of slavers from the Angry Coxswain used it to transport victims.
