        "mainbody": "Sardonyx helmet was a cassidae shell found in the Realms.\nHelmet shells were sought after for making cameos. Sardonyx helmet shells were named for the sardonyx-like appearance of cameos made from these shells. The reddish brown layer beneath a lighter colored layer mimicked the appearance of the gemstone. A large specimen in good condition had a base value of 40 gp."
