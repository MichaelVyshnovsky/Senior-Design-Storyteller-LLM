        "mainbody": "ring of dizziness was a cursed enchanted ring that assaulted the wearer with unbearable dizziness.\nThese items appeared to be normal magical rings and were often mistaken for rings of protection.\nThe power of a ring of dizziness only afflicted the wearer when they were in the midst of martial combat, bombarding them with violent dizziness that often prevented them from attacking while simultaneously making them easy targets for their enemies.\nThese rings could sometimes be found by unlucky explorers within tombs in Mulhorand. They were placed intentionally to serve as a deterrant for grave robbers."
