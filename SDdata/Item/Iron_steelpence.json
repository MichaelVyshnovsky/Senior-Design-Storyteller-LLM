        "mainbody": "ron steelpence, also known as the Sembian steelpense, was an iron coin used in Sembia in lieu of copper pieces.\nThe steelpence was a square-shaped coin, compared to the realms triangular silver pieces and five-sided gold pieces.\nOriginally intended to supplant the silver piece and allow the government of Sembia to hoard the silver, the steelpence was overproduced to the extent that its apparent value matched that of the lesser copper piece. Though widely disavowed by the respectable nobles of the realm, they still grudgingly accepted it as currency, and it effectively replaced copper coins.\nThe coins odd nature led to the saying \"Buying Steelpense with Bela\", indicating financial foolishness."
