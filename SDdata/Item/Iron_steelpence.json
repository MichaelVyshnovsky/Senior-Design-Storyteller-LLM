        "mainbody": "'''Iron steelpence''', also known as the '''Sembian steelpense''', was an [[iron]] coin used in [[Sembia]] in lieu of [[copper piece]]s.",
        "Description": "The steelpence was a square-shaped coin, compared to the realm's triangular silver pieces and five-sided [[gold piece]]s.",
        "History": "Originally intended to supplant the [[silver piece]] and allow the government of Sembia to hoard the [[silver]], the steelpence was overproduced to the extent that its apparent value matched that of the lesser copper piece. Though widely disavowed by the respectable nobles of the realm, they still grudgingly accepted it as currency, and it effectively replaced copper coins.\n\nThe coin's odd nature led to the saying \"Buying Steelpense with [[Bela]]\", indicating financial foolishness."
