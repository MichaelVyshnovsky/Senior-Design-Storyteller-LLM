The '''goblin stick''' was a forked & hooked [[polearm]] developed by [[bugbear]]s as both a weapon and a tool for capturing [[goblin]]s that were hiding from the wielder.

==Description==
A goblin stick consisted of a wooden stick, measuring {{SIrange|6|9|long=yes}} in length, that was usually gripped in the middle. On each end, a goblin stick was tipped with three sharp, pointed blades. The center blade was curved into a hook, while those on the side were set off in different directions and at slight angles.

==Weaponology==
The hooked central blade of a goblin stick was used to pull a target out of tight spaces. The angled side blades of the weapon were used to search for targets around corners and to reach into places that were otherwise difficult to reach. Additionally, goblin sticks could be used to trip an opponent.

==Notable Users==
In addition to bugbears, goblin sticks were often made and utilized by [[hobgoblin]]s and some [[ogre]]s.
