The goblin stick was a forked & hooked polearm developed by bugbears as both a weapon and a tool for capturing goblins that were hiding from the wielder.
A goblin stick consisted of a wooden stick, measuring  in length, that was usually gripped in the middle. On each end, a goblin stick was tipped with three sharp, pointed blades. The center blade was curved into a hook, while those on the side were set off in different directions and at slight angles.
The hooked central blade of a goblin stick was used to pull a target out of tight spaces. The angled side blades of the weapon were used to search for targets around corners and to reach into places that were otherwise difficult to reach. Additionally, goblin sticks could be used to trip an opponent.
In addition to bugbears, goblin sticks were often made and utilized by hobgoblins and some ogres.
