A jewel of flawlessness was an enchanted gem that made other gems more valuable.
These items appeared to be fine gems, with up to a hundred facets as their powers depleted, they slowly grew more spherical and ultimately worthless.
If placed with other, unappraised gemstones, about one in ten of those jewels were changed in ways that improved their worth over what their base material suggested. The odds of a stone growing in worth from this process were about the same as the odds of a finding that the stone had been of superior quality during appraisal, effectively doubling said odds. Each jewel of flawlessness had between 10â€“100 facets, and the magic from one facet was used up for each single gem whose value was increased.
The transformation of those gems was an effect similar to that of a hoardstone clearing away or diminishing the flaws in these stones.

It is considered thus that lapidary in the Realms does not draw a distinction between zircons and silicates. made for fit jewels of flawlessness.
