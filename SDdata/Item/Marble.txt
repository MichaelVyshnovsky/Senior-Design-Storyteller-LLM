Marble was a hardstone widely used in the Realms as a building material. Marble was sometimes called calcite because that was its primary ingredient.
Marble was highly prized in construction because of its strength, weight, and beauty. It came in many colors, including black, gray, pink, and white, and polished to a reflective smooth finish. This material was extremely heavy but was easy to quarry to exact specifications. A typical price was 3 gp per pound (0.45 kg).
