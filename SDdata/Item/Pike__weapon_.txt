'''Awl pikes''', also simply known as '''pikes''', were a member of the [[spear]] family of [[polearm]]s.

==Description==
These weapons were built similarly to [[longspear]]s,{{Cite dragon/331/The Point of Pole Arms|23}} having long shafts that varied in length at {{SIrange|16|22|ft|long=yes}}, but had a comparatively superior construction and balance that made them far more usable by smaller races like [[gnome]]s and [[halfling]]s. These shafts tended to be made of strong woods, such as those of an [[ash]] tree, with their non-bladed ends capped in [[silver]] and their grips wrapped in cloth in order to prevent splitting.

The bladed head of a pike was typically leaf- or lozenge- shaped. These heads often had two tongues of [[steel]], which were nailed down the sides of a pike's shaft in order to prevent the spear head from getting hacked off.

==Weaponology==
Like many spears, pikes were designed for the purpose of delivering thrusting and piercing attacks from a distance. The great length of the pike, coupled with its widespread deployment with infantry known as "pikemen", also helped to keep enemy forces at a distance.

==Availability==
Places in the Realms where one could purchase pikes included:
* [[Aunsible Durn's smithy|Aunsible Durn]], a smithy in the town of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], produced pikes that outfitted a number of local farmhands.
* The [[Weaponers of Cormyr]].
* In many of the bazaars found across [[Zakhara]], one could find an awl pike for around 4 to 7 [[gold piece]]s depending upon how good they were at haggling.<ref>
