The '''Eye of Blazing Rorn''' was a powerful [[dragon]] [[artifact]].

==Description==
The Eye of Blazing Rorn was literally the eye of the [[primordial]] [[Rorn]]. It had the form of a [[ruby]].

==Abilities==
The Eye of Blazing Rorn had the ability to channel the fury of Rorn, detonating powerful explosions of heat.

==History==
The dragons created this artifact by using one of the eyes of Rorn, who lost it during the [[War of Fang and Talon]]. The [[dragonborn]] heroines [[Iskdara]] and [[Shurideh]] stole it from its custodian, a [[silver dragon]] named [[Asativarainuth]], during the [[battle of Arambar Gulch]].

The dragonborn used the Eye during the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]] to destroy the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] by throwing the Eye into the mountain, that was actually a sleeping volcano, triggering a powerful explosion that not only destroyed the mountain but also killed the [[red dragon]] [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].

At some point, the Eye was recovered by the dragonborn. Since then, the artifact was under the custody of members of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].
