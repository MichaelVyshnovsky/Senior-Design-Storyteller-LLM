By the late 14 century DR, gilded armor was commonly worn by Captains of the Patrol in the nation of Samarach. In 1374 DR, one of these Captain, along with a band of patrolmen, invaded the hamlet of Nimbre, after hearing of the possible yuan-ti corruption. A group of adventurers hired by a merchant SaSani walked in on the harassment of peaceful villagers. Even though the outcome of the encounter remained unclear, some said that the gilded armor mightve changed hands that day.
