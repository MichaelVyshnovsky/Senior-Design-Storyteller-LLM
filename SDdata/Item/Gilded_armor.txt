'''''Gilded armor''''' were elaborately decorated [[enchanted]] [[breastplate]]s, worn by loyal ranking servants or the council of [[Samarach]].

==Powers==
''Gilded armor'' possessed ''+1'' enchantment and enhanced the wearers' ability to assert dominance and intimidate creatures.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''gilded armor'' was commonly worn by Captains of the Patrol in the nation of Samarach. In [[1374 DR]], one of these Captain, along with a band of patrolmen, invaded the hamlet of [[Nimbre]], after hearing of the possible [[yuan-ti]] corruption. A group of adventurers hired by a merchant [[Sa'Sani]] walked in on the harassment of peaceful villagers. Even though the outcome of the encounter remained unclear, some said that the ''gilded armor'' might've changed hands that day.
