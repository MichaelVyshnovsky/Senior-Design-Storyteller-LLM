==Description==
The ''dragon masques'' resembled the typical Cult of the Dragon masks, with an ornate horned design that covered the upper face.

==Powers==
The masques used by the followers of [[Aurgloroasa]] were imbued with shadowy energies, adding [[negative energy]] to their strikes and using manipulating shadows to make trickery and sneak attacks easier.

==History==
The Cult of the Dragon forces that served Aurgloroasa in [[Thunderholme]] used these masques in the 1480s [[DR]], with at least one recovered from [[Thunder Peak]] after an encounter with the [[red dragon]]s [[Nevalarich]] and [[Thraxata]].
