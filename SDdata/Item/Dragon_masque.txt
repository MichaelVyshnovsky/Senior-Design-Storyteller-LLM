Dragon masques were a type of magical mask used by the Cult of the Dragon in the late 15 century DR.
The dragon masques resembled the typical Cult of the Dragon masks, with an ornate horned design that covered the upper face.
The masques used by the followers of Aurgloroasa were imbued with shadowy energies, adding negative energy to their strikes and using manipulating shadows to make trickery and sneak attacks easier.
The Cult of the Dragon forces that served Aurgloroasa in Thunderholme used these masques in the 1480s DR, with at least one recovered from Thunder Peak after an encounter with the red dragons Nevalarich and Thraxata.
