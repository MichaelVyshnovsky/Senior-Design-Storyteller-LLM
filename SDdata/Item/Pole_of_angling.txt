A '''''pole of angling''''' was a magical [[10-foot pole]].

==Powers==
When a special [[command word]] was spoken, this {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} long pole would transform into a fully functional [[fishing rod]]. The transformation included a hook, line, and a reel. When the command word was spoken again, the rod transformed back into a pole.
