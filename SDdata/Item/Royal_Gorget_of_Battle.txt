The Royal Gorget of Battle was an enchanted gorget in possession of the royal family of Cormyr.
The powers, while nondescript, were largely defensive in nature.
The Gorget was loaned by Elminster Aumar, wizard and Chosen of Mystra, to King Palaghard Obarskyr I of Cormyr before his reign to ensure his safety. Palaghard in turn let it be worn by his wife Enchara, with Elminsters blessing. Afterwards, it was left in the Warhorn Room, displayed as a state treasure of Cormyr.
On Mirtul 5 of the , Elminster stole the Gorget from its display case, unaware that Vainrence had cast a tracing spell on it. The tracing spell eventually drew a force of mages bearing orders to retrieve the Gorget or utterly annihilate Elminster they persisted in this endeavor upon catching up with him, despite his protestations.
