Clubs of smiting were enchanted bludgeons created to destroy constructs and found in common use in the late 14 century DR.
Clubs of smiting bore a simple +1 enchantment that guided the wielders arm towards the target and increased the weapons damage output. However, these weapons true power was in using them to battle constructs. Each successful attack with a club of smiting had a chance of interfering with the magics that animated constructs, instantly and completely destroying them.
By the , clubs of smiting could be found in the hands of adventurers in the city of Neverwinter, as well as found in the depths of Undermountain, the massive dungeon underneath the City of Splendors, Waterdeep.
