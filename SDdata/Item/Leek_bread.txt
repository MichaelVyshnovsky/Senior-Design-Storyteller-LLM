Leek bread was one of the staples of dwarven cuisine throughout Faerûn.
Leek bread was baked in small fist-sized rolls. Leek handloaves were a common sight on dwarven tables as long as leeks were locally available. This bread was served with potato and leek soup, rothé back steak, and other dwarven dishes.
