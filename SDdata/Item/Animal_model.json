        "mainbody": "Animal models, also referred to as rolling animals, wheeled animal models, or pull toys were toy wood carvings of animals on wheeled platforms with a string to pull them along.\nAnimal models could be carved to resemble all manner of animals, as well as some monsters. They typically measured  in length,  tall, and weighed . Internal hinges were used in their crafting that enabled their tails to move, as well as their mouths to open and close, as the models were moved along the ground. Some, like those modeled on a wyvern, had hinged wings that would flap as they were moved.\nAnimal models that were referred to as \"pull toys\" had a string attached to them, allowing them to be pulled across the ground.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold animal models carved from refined Cormyrean and Sembian woods. The types of animals on offered included cows, dragons, elephants, horses, pegasi, pack mules, and unicorns. At one point the magazine offered rolling beholders, but by the 1370S DR it had been discontinued. The catalogue recommended the toy for children ages two to five and sold them all at a set price of 1 gold piece.\n* The Toysmiths, a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the gnome brothers Gunder and Relvan Gaewilder, sold animal models in many of the same styles as Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. However, the brothers charged different prices for each style of model. Horses for 5 silver pieces, elephants for 6 sp, war horses for 7 sp, pegasi and unicorns for 8 sp, and dragons for 10 sp. Additionally, Toysmiths was open to taking custom orders, which could range in price from 5 to 30 silver pieces."
