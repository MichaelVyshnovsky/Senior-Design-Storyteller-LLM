        "mainbody": "'''Animal models''', also referred to as '''rolling animals''', '''wheeled animal models''',{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}} or '''pull toys'''{{Cite organized play/LC/All the World's a Stage|18}} were toy wood carvings of animals on wheeled platforms with a string to pull them along.",
        "Description": "Animal models could be carved to resemble all manner of animals, as well as some monsters. They typically measured {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} in length, {{SI|12|ft}} tall, and weighed {{SI|5|lb|k}}. Internal [[hinges]] were used in their crafting that enabled their tails to move, as well as their mouths to open and close, as the models were moved along the ground. Some, like those modeled on a [[wyvern]], had hinged wings that would flap as they were moved.\n\nAnimal models that were referred to as \"pull toys\" had a string attached to them, allowing them to be pulled across the ground.",
        "Availability": "* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold animal models carved from refined [[Cormyrean]] and [[Sembian]] woods. The types of animals on offered included [[cow]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[horse]]s, [[pegasi]], pack [[mule]]s, and [[unicorn]]s. At one point the magazine offered rolling [[beholder]]s, but by the 1370'S [[DR]] it had been discontinued. The catalogue recommended the toy for children ages two to five and sold them all at a set price of 1 [[gold piece]].\n* The [[Toysmiths]], a toyshop in Ravens Bluff that was owned and operated by the [[gnome]] brothers [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] and [[Relvan Gaewilder]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|7}} sold animal models in many of the same styles as ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue''. However, the brothers charged different prices for each style of model. Horses for 5 [[silver piece]]s, elephants for 6 sp, [[war horse]]s for 7 sp, pegasi and unicorns for 8 sp, and dragons for 10 sp. Additionally, Toysmiths was open to taking custom orders, which could range in price from 5 to 30 silver pieces."
