Treacle, or molasses, was a liquid, uncrystallized sugar syrup, sometimes eaten as a frozen treat.
Treacle was a dark-colored opaque brown unrefined sugar syrup, as well as its lighter-colored variation known as golden syrup.
Treacle could be found in alchemy labs, food vendor stalls, taverns, and among items of some healers and physicians.
Treacles was a common addition to oatmeal, when maple syrup was not available. It was also used to prepare sweet treats such as nutbrown tarts and ginger biscuits breads, like darkloaf, as well as firefruit meat sauces and marinades and sweet bean-barrel-sauce - as a type of edible preservative (however some preferred to wash the treacle sauce off before consuming). Lastly, treacle was sued in brewing and sweetening rums and darkfire alcohols.
Alcohol-soaked cherries were used in making molasses-base cherrybread, popular in the Vilhon Reach, the Border Kingdoms, and the region of the Sea of Fallen Stars, with its fame reaching the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR. Another pastry that used molasses was a pie-sized treacle tart found in the Chionthar Valley.
Rogues sometimes used a thieves tool called tar paperâ€”a piece of thick and heavy paper, drenched in tar, honey, or treacle. The paper was stuck on glass before being broken by a burglar. This simple tool reduced noise and contained all the glass shards in place.
A single drop of treacle was used as a material component for the slow spell, prior to the Time of Troubles.
