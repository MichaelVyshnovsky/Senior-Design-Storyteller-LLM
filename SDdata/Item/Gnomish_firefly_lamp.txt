'''Gnomish firefly lamps''' were decorative [[lamp]]s that were popular at parties held by the nobility across [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
A typical firefly lamp consisted of a basket-shaped container made of a wired mesh that served as a trap to capture [[Fyrefly|fireflies]]. The glow provided by the fireflies did not provide any useful illumination, but made for a nice eye-catching atmospheric glow in gardens or darkened rooms. Captured fireflies died if not released by the end of the evening.

Gnomish firefly lamps were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==History==
These lamps became popular among the nobility in several cities, including [[Arabel]], [[Neverwinter]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Suzail]], and [[Waterdeep]], in the 1360s [[DR]].
