'''''Bullet of disruption''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[sling]] [[bullet]] deadly to the [[undead]].

==Powers==
Cores of the ''bullets of disruption'' were ensorcelled with magical currents that improved their aim and balance. These bullets also obsessed enchantments that disrupted magics that kept the undead reanimated and planar creatures anchored to the [[Prime Material plane]]. As such, ''bullets of disruption'' were especially useful against those two types of creatures. Each strike for these bullets had a chance of instantly destroying an outsider or an undead creature. Additionally, they were imbued with a simple ''+1'' enchantment.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, these bullets were used by the [[Legion of the Chimera]] to bring destruction on the [[Ten Towns]] and [[Kuldahar]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
