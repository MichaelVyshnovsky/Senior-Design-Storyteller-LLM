        "mainbody": "he Teeth of Dahlver-Nar () was a collection of magical teeth discovered by and named for Dahlver-Nar, a human cleric and binder.\nThe Teeth of Dahlver-Nar were all associated with different powerful individuals or legendary stories. The individual teeth were as wildly varied as their associated owners. Some teeth were human in origin, others resembled long snake fangs, gemstones, or tusks. For those so inclined, it was possible to implant individual Teeth of Dahlver-Nar the teeth would change their size (to a degree) to accommodate their new hosts mouth.\nThe teeth were kept inside a leather pouch decorated with stitched images of various heroes and lightly fanciful creatures.\nIt was possible to destroy the individual Teeth of Dahlver-Nar, though scholars disagreed on the exact procedure. Some claimed the only way was to soak the teeth in sweet water for a thousand years, letting them slowly rot away. Another version maintained the teeth must all be implanted into the mouth of a conscious ancient red dragon without explanation. A third version claimed the teeth must be bathed in the breaths of thirty-two different dragons over the course of thirty-two days.\nIn yet another version, the individual teeth had to be planted in the areas where their associated tales originated. Whatever the case truly was, seemingly destroyed Teeth of Dahlver-Nar had a tendency to re-appear at some later date.\nThe primary way of gaining the powers of the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar was to implant them in place of ones own teeth. Although it was possible to have more than one tooth implanted at a time, legends claimed that implanting too many of them could lead to madness. Some accounts maintained that in order to implant a tooth of Dahlver-Nar, it was first necessary to extract ones natural tooth by force. In other versions, placing a tooth of Dahlver-Nar in ones mouth would simply remove the users original tooth and its place would be taken automatically.\nAlternately, some of the teeth could be planted in the ground to either produce the effects of a spell or to summon certain creatures associated with the individual tooth.\nEach individual tooth of Dahlver-Nar was a unique item with its own associated magical effects. At least three sets of teeth were documented by scholars, although this could simply be a reflection of the roster of teeth changing over time.\nThis set of thirty-two red dragon teeth was associated with the story of how Dahlver-Nar found the teeth in the lair of the red dragon Incendax. Rather than each individual tooth having a unique power, these teeth granted their wielder (indeed, no implantation was required) several powers associated with dragons the ability to speak Draconic, immunity to harmful fire, and the ability to sense all gems and precious metals in their vicinity. Also, the tooth-bearer could invoke a cone of magical fire from his or her palm.\nAdditionally, Incendaxs teeth could be planted in the ground to produce yet more magical effects. Planting the non-molar teeth allowed for the summoning of powerful creatures such as fire giants, remorhazes, and wyverns. Planting the molars allowed their wielder to cast a semi-random spell, ranging from teleport without error to disintegrate to domination.\nHowever, the wielder of the teeth quickly fell victim to an insidious curse that turned them evil and prone to hoarding treasure (especially the teeth themselves), and to feel compelled to establish a lair in a cave somewhere.\nAll the teeth in this set were associated with powerful souls capable of granting powers to their servants.Tome of Magic uses the term \"vestige\" for these pact-granting soul entities. In the 5th edition Dungeon Masters Guide, \"vestige\" refers to a dead or forgotten deity, and so the term is avoided here. Implanting one of these teeth linked the wielders mind and body to that specific soul. These powerful souls would occasionally attempt to influence the tooth-bearer this influence could be resisted but doing so generally led to adverse effects. Additionally, implanting a tooth associated with a powerful soul caused the tooth-ee to display physical signs associated with that soul, such as teeth growing from ones scalp\nAll the teeth in this set were associated with a particular story, and could both be implanted to gain magical effects or planted in the ground to summon various creatures, though planting the tooth caused it to disappear.\nWho created the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar was completely unknown, as was the process for making them. While it was universally accepted that Dahlver-Nar discovered the teeth, several versions of the story existed. In one version, Dahlver-Nar was a novice cleric who chanced upon the teeth while exploring the lair of the dead red dragon Incendax, who had been destroyed by (and in turn destroyed) thirteen archmages. In this rendition, all the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar belonged to the dead dragon.\nIn another version, Dahlver-Nar was a supremely powerful cleric favored by the gods. When he died, his teeth were imbued with great magic and were treated as holy relics by his followers.\nA third version was told among binder scholars. Here, Dahlver-Nar was a cleric who forsook his divine calling to gain power through pact magic, and who grew obsessed with the teeth after discovering them. These scholars maintained that the teeth were not Dahlver-Nars own, nor did they belong to a dragon, but were instead associated with souls that had grown powerful enough to grant powers through others via pacts.\nMany people believed that the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar were used by malevolent forces to control the minds and actions of those who implanted them. They were correct.\n* Dahlver-Nar, who discovered the teeth and became so obsessed with them that his soul gained tooth-themed powers in the afterlife."
