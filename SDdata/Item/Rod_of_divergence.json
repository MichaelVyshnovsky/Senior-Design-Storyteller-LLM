        "Powers": "A ''rod of divergence'' was constructed to act against one type of energy and provided ''[[resist energy]]'' for that type of energy that was designated upon its creation. It could produce ''[[faerie fire]]'' of any color at will, and once per day, the rod would automatically deflect any incoming spell of the rod's energy type within {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}}-{{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the rod, as if by the ''[[spell turning]]'' spell onto a target within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}-{{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}, provided it can be turned.{{Cite dragon/173/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A wizard's staff is to lean on}}\n\nWhen such an item was created, it possessed fifty charges. Redirecting a spell as if by ''spell turning'' consumed three charges.",
        "Creation": "A ''rod'' or a ''staff of divergence'' could be created by a skilled crafter of [[encahnted]] rods with the use of the ''faerie fire,'' and ''spell turning'' spells.",
