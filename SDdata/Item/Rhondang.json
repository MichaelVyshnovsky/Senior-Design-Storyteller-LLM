        "mainbody": "Rhondang was a powerful magical warhammer and the chosen weapon of Flandal Steelskin.\nRhondang was made of mithril and was coated with gold. Instead of a flat back, it had an axe-blade on its back.\nThis warhammer had a +5 enchantment. Creatures that made use of cold-based attacks or lived in cold places were vulnerable to this weapon. On the other hand, the weapon spoke the languages of every fire-using creature, such as fire elementals.\nFlandals favored weapon was able to launch a fireball every minute, as well as burst into a flame at will."
