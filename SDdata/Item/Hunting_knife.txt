Hunting knives were tools sometimes used by rangers or woodsmen throughout Faer√ªn.
Hunting knives were available for a wide variety of applications to include serrated blades, hooked blades, bellied blades, etc.
Hunting knives were used either for killing prey, or skinning or butchering the prey after it was slain. They could also be used as weapons.
A set of five hunting knives of various lengths were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 12 gold pieces.
