'''Mason's tools''' were sets of equipment that were used by masons to assist with the construction and maintenance of stonework.

==Description==
These sets of tools included [[hammer]]s, [[chisel]]s, [[trowel]]s, [[brush]]es, and [[square]]s. Those proficient with these tools were skilled at inspecting stonework and even spotting weak points in walls made of stone. This made them able to take down stone structures with ease. They were also able to determine the approximate date that stone buildings were constructed, as well as the potential builders. [[Dwarves]] were often proficient with these tools.

==Usage==
These kits were used in several places throughout [[Faer√ªn]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Thorvin Twinbeard]], [[Xanathar]]'s top engineer who always carried mason's tools, [[smith's tools]], and [[thieves' tools]].
