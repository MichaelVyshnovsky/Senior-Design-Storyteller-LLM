'''''Malchor's undersun goggles''''' were magical sets of eyewear used to see in the darkness of the [[Underdark]]. They were invented by the wizard [[Malchor Harpell]].

==Powers==
''Undersun goggles'' were enchanted with the eponymous "''undersun''", which enabled wearers normally unable to see in low-light conditions to do so with full sight, albeit with some imperfections. This effect only worked in areas with ''[[faerzress]]''.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the optics merchant [[Beli Bragason]] freely distributed ''Malchor's undersun goggles'' to adventurers in the [[Deep Wastes]] underneath the [[King's Forest]].
