        "mainbody": "Spellweb were magic weapons, that were rumored to be used as tools to defend the island nation of Lantan from pirates and invaders.\nThese weapons fed off magic, enchantments, and spells, unleashed and even those spells that were still held within a mages mind. Any spellcaster that entered the area of a spellweb was rendered feebleminded and lost all magical abilities for a period of time, or even forever.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the hin thief named Jonslyn Windtongue managed to steal one of the spellwebs. The Ayrorch, the Council of Twelve, dispatched the Hands of Gond agents to find the halfling thief and return what was stolen by all means."
