        "mainbody": "'''Muskets''' were a heavier and more powerful variation of the [[arquebus]].",
        "Description": "Muskets that came from [[Lantan]] typically had the symbol of [[Gond]] stamped on the butt of their stock.",
        "Weaponology": "Muskets needed to rest upon a support to fire correctly. This typically took the form of a Y-shaped pole that one would jam into the ground. One could technically rest a musket upon anything, but doing so could hinder their chances at firing correctly.\n\nLike all arquebuses, muskets were sturdy enough to be wielded like a [[club]], but they could be damaged in the process.",
        "History": "On the world of [[Toril]], the musket originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the [[Time of Troubles]], after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate [[firearm]]s that utilized smokepowder.\n\nWhen the musket and other arquebuses first showed up off of Lantan they were considered mere curios, but after five or so years they became increasingly common.<ref>{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}} With one source being the [[Smiths' Coster]] trading company, who conducted business with the Lantanna, [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]], and elsewhere.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], one could purchase muskets among other firearms from [[The Brigadier]], a [[giff]] gunsmith, in [[Skullport]].",
        "Price": "In the first three years that it was available for purchase outside of Lantan, a musket cost roughly 8,000 [[gold piece]]s. Through the third to fifth year, as the weapon became more common, the cost lowered to 1,600 gold pieces. Following the fifth year, a musket on Toril consistently cost around 800 gold pieces.",
        "Reputation": "Many in [[Wildspace]] considered muskets to be erratic and untrustworthy."
