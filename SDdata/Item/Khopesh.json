        "mainbody": "A '''khopesh''' ({{Plural|khopeshes}}) was a one-handed slashing weapon wielded like a [[sword]] or an [[axe]].",
        "Description": "The khopesh typically had a handle like a knife rather than a hilt like a sword. The handle was about {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} long with optional [[wikipedia:quillon|quillons]]. The blade extended straight for {{SIrange|0'8\"|2'0\"|ft-in|long=yes}}  and then curved like a [[sickle]] with a sharp convex edge. The end of the blade was shaped to form a hook.",
        "Weaponology": "The khopesh was a specialized weapon used in a slashing fashion like a sword or an axe. The {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} blade was long and heavy, making this weapon slow to recover especially after a missed swing. \n\nLike [[battleaxe]]s, which were slightly smaller, khopeshes could be wielded with either one or two hands by creatures of roughly [[human]] size, dealing more damage when wielded with two, though at the cost of defense. Khopeshes were more brutal than most weapons dealing at least minor wounds whenever it hit.",
        "History": "[[Bronze]] and [[iron]] khopesh swords first appeared in [[Netheril]] in the year {{Yearlink|-3105}}, serving as a primary military weapon for over a thousand years; both metals existed side-by-side in military and ceremonial functions, undergoing refinements until {{Yearlink|-2526}} when steel-making technology advanced to the point where [[steel]] khopeshes were developed to deal with the newly introduced steel [[chain mail]] armour. The steel khopesh continued to evolve until {{Yearlink|-2059}} when it ceased to be produced, leaving the field to the [[scimitar]]s and [[longsword]]s widely available at that time.",
        "Usage": "Khopeshes were commonly found and used in [[Mulhorand]] and [[Zakhara]].{{cite book/Arabian Adventures}}",
