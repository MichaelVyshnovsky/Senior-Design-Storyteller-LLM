Runic shield was a magically enchanted shield usable by sorcerers.
Runic shields were inscribed with magical sigils that allowed sorcerers to use them with almost no chance of spell failure. The shield itself provided a +2 defense enchantment when held.
In 1369 DR, one of runic shields could be found in Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor in a chest along with gemstones and an eidolon, a mysterious stone head,  guarded by two wraiths.
