The '''''belt of the Seldarine''''' was an [[artifact]] dedicated to the [[elf|elven]] pantheon, the [[Seldarine]], and a part of a set of artifacts that powered each other as well as the wearer.

==Powers==
The ''belt of the Seldarine'' was a [[belt]] [[enchanted]] to be a proud and visible symbol of devotion to the Seldarine and the love of the elven deities of their mortal worshipers. The ''belt of the Seldarine'' and its more powerful version, the ''greater belt of the Seldarine'', empowered its wearer, increasing their dexterity and charisma. Additionally, it boosted their physical power and skills of deflecting incoming blows and granted a slight ability to siphon their opponents' vitality. When such a belt was worn in tandem with a ''[[cloak of the Seldarine]]'' and the ''[[emblem of the Seldarine]]'', the set also increased the wearer's health and toughness and healed a small part of each incoming blow.

==History==
The ''belt of the Seldarine'' was found in the hands of [[adventurer]]s and defenders of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis and the rise of [[Tiamat]] through the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s machinations all around [[northwest Faerûn]].
