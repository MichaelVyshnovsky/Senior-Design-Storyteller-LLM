'''''Firebane''''' was an enchanted ''[[jambiya]]'' stored within the [[Gallery of Antiquities]] in the [[Jade Palace of the Necromancers]] in [[Ysawis]].

==Description==
The hilt and scabbard of this weapon were made from pure [[jade]].

==Powers==
This ''jambiya'' made it substantially easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. As its name implied, the powers of ''Firebane'' were doubled against fire-dwelling creatures or any creature using [[Flame (province)|flame]] magic.
