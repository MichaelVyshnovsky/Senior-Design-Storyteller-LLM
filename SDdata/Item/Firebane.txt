Firebane was an enchanted jambiya stored within the Gallery of Antiquities in the Jade Palace of the Necromancers in Ysawis.
The hilt and scabbard of this weapon were made from pure jade.
This jambiya made it substantially easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponents. As its name implied, the powers of Firebane were doubled against fire-dwelling creatures or any creature using flame magic.
