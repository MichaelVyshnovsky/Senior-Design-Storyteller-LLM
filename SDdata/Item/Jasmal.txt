'''Jasmal''' was a [[gem stones|gemstone]] found in the [[Thunder Peaks]] and the [[Spine of the World]] mountains. Jasmals were sacred to the worshipers of deities [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Gruumsh]], [[Ilneval]], and [[Lliira]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Description==
Jasmals were usually found in small veins of ore. Very rarely, a large deposit was found in a seam. This clear and colorless gem was extremely hard and durable, even able to hold a sharp edge for use in small, non-metallic weapons,{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|20}} or mounted on a larger blade and enchanted (see below). Typically, jasmals were cut cabochon and polished to bring out their optical properties when worn as adornments on cloaks and clothing. Polished jasmals absorbed sunlight or light from fires and torches and gave off a nimbus of [[amber]] or orange that surrounded the stones even though the jasmals remained colorless and transparent. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 to 3,000 gp.

==Powers==
Crushed to powder, jasmal was the ingredient of choice for enchanted immersions used to make magical armor and in the recipe for the [[ink]] used to scribe scrolls of ''[[Veladar's vambrace]]''. Whole jasmals could accept complex enchantments or many simple enchantments and were thus mounted in a row along a blade to deliver their effects when a strike was successful.
