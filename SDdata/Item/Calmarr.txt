Calmarr or ornsoelaun was a variety of cheese, staple on the tables of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach.
Calmarr was a soft and crumbly variety of cheese, veined with chives and other types of herbs. These cheeses were locally made across Turmish and served as a part of daily meal routine as cheese platters alongside brown nutbreads, onion and chive soups, meats, and spiced greens.
