'''Red Helmet''' was a [[wikipedia:en:cassidae|cassidae]] shell found in the Realms.

==Description==
Helmet shells were sought after for making cameos. Red helmet shells had reddish brown layers in stripes beneath lighter colored layers that made uniquely patterned cameos. A large specimen in good condition had a base value of 20 gp.
