The so-called '''''Goblin's Grog''''' was a magical intoxicating drink brewed by [[goblin]]s of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].

{{quote|''Get the grog outta da box and drink it. Den, go get [[cow]] and giv it one of davgrogz too! Snot zactly trikky! If you is stoopid askz.''|"Instrukshuns" for [[Gorgomorz]]' army}}

==Description==
This grog drink possessed an attractive color and not-so-attractive odor. Some described the brew's smell as a potent mix of odoriferous two-week-old [[cabbage]] and the foul stench of a [[bear]]'s armpit.

==Powers==
Apart from being intoxicating, the brew functioned as a ''[[potion of invisibility]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, goblins of the Delimbiyr Vale were enrolled into servitude to the [[orc]]s and [[tanarukka]] army of the [[Devil]] of [[Daggerford]]â€“Gorgomorz. The goblins brewed their foul ''grog'' and generously imbibed it. When drunk and ''[[Invisibility|invisible]]'', they ventured into the [[Wild Pastures]] where they fed the magical ''grog'' to [[cattle]]. To observers, it appeared as if the cows simply vanished into thin air in the middle of the day.
