The so-called Goblins Grog was a magical intoxicating drink brewed by goblins of the Delimbiyr Vale.
This grog drink possessed an attractive color and not-so-attractive odor. Some described the brews smell as a potent mix of odoriferous two-week-old cabbage and the foul stench of a bears armpit.
Apart from being intoxicating, the brew functioned as a potion of invisibility.
In the , goblins of the Delimbiyr Vale were enrolled into servitude to the orcs and tanarukka army of the Devil of Daggerfordâ€“Gorgomorz. The goblins brewed their foul grog and generously imbibed it. When drunk and invisible, they ventured into the Wild Pastures where they fed the magical grog to cattle. To observers, it appeared as if the cows simply vanished into thin air in the middle of the day.
