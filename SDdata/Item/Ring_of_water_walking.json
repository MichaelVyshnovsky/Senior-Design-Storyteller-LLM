        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of water walking''''' were magical [[ring]]s that allowed one to walk upon the surface of water.",
        "Description": "Most of these rings were set with an [[opal]]. To those able to [[Detect magic|detect magical auras]], the ring gave off a moderately strong aura of [[transmutation]] magic.\n\n''Rings of water walking'' sold for about 15,000 [[gold piece]]s in most economies.",
        "Abilities": "Not surprisingly, wearing this ring was exactly the same as if one were under the effects of a ''[[water walk]]'' spell, except that the power to walk on water lasted for as long as the ring was worn.\n\nPutting on the ring while submerged would magically rush the wearer to the surface at the speed of an average jog.",
        "Creation": "To forge a ''ring of water walking'', a spellcaster needed to be able to cast the ''water walk'' spell.",
        "Notable Wearers": "* [[Basem bin Rumi]], a [[gnome]] [[alchemist]] of [[Zakhara]].\n* [[Khalil]], a [[Corsair (disambiguation)|corsair]] and [[sha'ir]] of Zakhara."
