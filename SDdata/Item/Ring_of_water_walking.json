        "mainbody": "Rings of water walking were magical rings that allowed one to walk upon the surface of water.\nMost of these rings were set with an opal. To those able to detect magical auras, the ring gave off a moderately strong aura of transmutation magic.\nRings of water walking sold for about 15,000 gold pieces in most economies.\nNot surprisingly, wearing this ring was exactly the same as if one were under the effects of a water walk spell, except that the power to walk on water lasted for as long as the ring was worn.\nPutting on the ring while submerged would magically rush the wearer to the surface at the speed of an average jog.\nTo forge a ring of water walking, a spellcaster needed to be able to cast the water walk spell.\n* Basem bin Rumi, a gnome alchemist of Zakhara.\n* Khalil, a corsair and shair of Zakhara."
