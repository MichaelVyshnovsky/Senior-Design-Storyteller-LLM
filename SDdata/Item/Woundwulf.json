        "mainbody": "Woundwulf was an enchanted longsword of likely elven origins from the depths of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor.\nThis expensive-looking longsword had an intricately detailed head of a wolf on its hilt.\nWoundwulf possessed a powerful +5 enchantment it enhanced the owners strength and improved their fortitude. Additionally, Woundwulf allowed the wielder to siphon the targets life force, similar to the vampiric touch spell. The blade had five charges of the magical draining effect.\nWoundwulf dated back to ancient Myth Drannor. The longsword was among many magical artifacts that became interred along with countless elven heroes of the City of Song under Castle Cormanthor. By 1369 DR, the owner of the blade was wandering the halls of the ancient catacombs as a master wight, surrounded by several mohrgs. The undead carried Woundwulf and another powerful enchanted weapon, Wroths Executioner."
