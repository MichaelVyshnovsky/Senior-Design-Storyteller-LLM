'''''Leech''''' was a [[cursed]] [[polearm]] found in the centre west of [[Darkmoon]]'s silver tower.

==Description==
In combat, the polearm would make its owner miss more often than they would with a regular polearm, equivalent to a [[weapon]] with a ''-2'' enchantment.

The room containing ''Leech'' could only be found via a secret mechanism in a room full of [[flying snake]]s. Once the button was located and pressed, a door would swing upon, revealing the cursed polearm.

Either ''Leech'' or ''[[Hunger]]'' was required as the key to solving a riddle, requested by an animated mouth. Once the weapon was fed to the mouth, it was possible to progress further into Temple Darkmoon.
