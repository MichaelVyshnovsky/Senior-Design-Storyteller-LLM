Gauntlets of weaponry arcane  were magical leather gloves that allowed their wearer limited arcane ability.
These gauntlets were crafted from dragonhide and decorated with runes of silver thread.
Once per day, the wearer could cast the spell magic weapon, which would last while at least one of the gauntlets was grasping the affected weapon.
