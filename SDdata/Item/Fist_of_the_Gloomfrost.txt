The '''''Fist of the Gloomfrost''''' was a powerful enchanted [[mace]], forged from the ''[[black ice]]'' of [[Gloomfrost]] glacier in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
Even though forged out of strange black ice, the ''Fist of the Gloomfrost'' was only slightly cold to the touch, remaining unbelting even in the hottest flames.

==Powers==
Apart from having a powerful ''+5'' enchantment, the ''Fist of the Gloomfrost'' granted the wielder minor resistance to fire and cold. Upon a successful strike, the ''Fist'' had a chance of dramatically increasing crushing damage dealt to its target. On top of that, this black ice mace allowed the wielder to activate its ''[[storm shell]]'' ability once a day, granting them resistance to fire, cold, and lightning for ten minutes.

==History==
The ''Fist of the Gloomfrost'' was forged in [[1281 DR]] by a blind [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith who inhabited the icy depths of [[Gloomfrost]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Blinded by the [[Seer (Gloomfrost)|Seer]], [[Tiernon Denthelm]]'s hands were guided by the hands of the heroes of [[Ten Towns]] in a long process of shaping the magical black ice of Gloomfrost into this enchanted mace.
