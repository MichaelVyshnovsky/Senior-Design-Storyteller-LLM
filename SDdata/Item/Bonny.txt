'''''Bonny''''' was a piece of enchanted fabric from [[Waterdeep]] that was folded into a makeshift bandana in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Bonny'' was a navy-blue piece of cloth with a light-blue shape on its middle.

==Powers==
''Bonny'' allowed the wearer to cast a burst of powerful ''healing'' magic onto an ally.

==History==
At some point in the late 15{{th}} century DR, Calliope found herself preparing to raid a midnight ball somewhere in Waterdeep's [[Sea Ward]]. The bard knew that she would either need a mask or a good bandage and sliced a piece of [[Mirt]] the Moneylender's coat for that very purpose. Little did she know that the coat and the fabric she took from the unsuspecting Old Wolf was imbued with powerful restorative enchantments.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Calliope]]: a [[bard]] adventurer who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
