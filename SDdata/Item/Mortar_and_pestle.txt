'''Mortar and pestle''' were tools designed to crush solid materials into powder or to extract active ingredients from plants and [[herb]]s. They were an integral part of [[alchemist's supplies]], [[herbalism kit]]s, and [[wizard]]s' laboratories.

==Description==
A typical mortar and pestle set was smoothly polished in the outside areas, that were most likely to be handled, and rough on the inside, so as to maximize grinding and crushing efficiency.

More expensive mortar and pestle sets were gilded. This was not for luxury's sake, however. Wooden instruments were hard to clean, and metallic ones interfered with components, sometimes in disastrous ways. To avoided that, mortars and pestles could be coated in a thin layer of [[gold]].

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold two different sizes of mortar and pestle sets made of black [[marble]].
* [[Morrigan's Complete Components]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] had a variety of mortars and pestles in stock.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/75/The Living City: Eye Of Newt and Food For Familiars|6}}

==History==
The carapaces of [[sartani]] were sometimes used to craft mortars in parts of [[Zakhara]].

==Notable Mortar & Pestles==
* [[Khelben Arunsun]] once owned a finely crafted set made by [[Rashemi]] from black marble, but lost it some time following the [[Spellplague]]. Having once been owned by such a legendary individual, this mortar and pestle could fetch prices upward of 500 [[gp]].
