Mortar and pestle were tools designed to crush solid materials into powder or to extract active ingredients from plants and herbs. They were an integral part of alchemists supplies, herbalism kits, and wizards laboratories.
A typical mortar and pestle set was smoothly polished in the outside areas, that were most likely to be handled, and rough on the inside, so as to maximize grinding and crushing efficiency.
More expensive mortar and pestle sets were gilded. This was not for luxurys sake, however. Wooden instruments were hard to clean, and metallic ones interfered with components, sometimes in disastrous ways. To avoided that, mortars and pestles could be coated in a thin layer of gold.
