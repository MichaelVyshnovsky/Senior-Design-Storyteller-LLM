        "mainbody": "'''''Summertongue''''', also known as '''''Felthann''''' and '''Liluth's Summertongue''', was a magical [[sword]] that once belonged to [[Liluth]] and was one of the treasures in the [[Vault of Ages]] in [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Powers": "Said to cut darkness, it was a powerful magical ''+3 [[longsword]]'' that destroyed [[shadow]]s at a touch and struck thrice as hard as normal against other non-corporeal [[undead]] such as [[wraith]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[watchghost]]s or [[vampire]]s in ''[[gaseous form]]''.",
        "History": "''Summertongue'' was stored within the Vault of Ages as of {{yearlink|241}}. It was considered \"old\" by the [[elves]] even then. [[Elminster]] passed on it when he searched the vault with the [[Srinshee]] at that time.\n\nHowever, much later, ''Summertongue'', known then as ''Felthann'', resurfaced in [[Impiltur]]. It was acquired by Mage Royal [[Soargar]] and stored in his tower in [[Lyrabar]] as part of his mission to preserve the treasures of Old Impiltur as the realm fractured. ''Summertongue'' was one among a hundred or so magical weapons in the collection known as [[Soargar's Legacy]]. In the [[1095 DR|Year of the Dawn Dance, 1095 DR]], Soargar granted the collection to [[Imphras I]] in anticipation of when the monarchy in Impiltur would be reestablished, two years later. ''Summertongue'' and the rest of the weapons were shared among Imphras and his loyal battle companions, who later became his [[Royal Guard]].{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|86}}\n\nHowever, ''Summertongue'' and the other enchanted weapons were lost when King [[Imbrar I]] led the Royal Guard against the [[hobgoblin]]s of the [[Giantspire Mountains]] in the [[1127 DR|Year of the Luminar Procession, 1127 DR]], and the whole force vanished without a trace.\n\n[[Othiiyr Velthrann]], a [[sage]] from the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]], made his life's work the study of the magic swords of Soargar's Legacy. Othiiyr recorded the legends around them, and pieced together the history of ''Summertongue'' and the other blades. Othiiyr assisted the [[Knights of Imphras II]] in their continuing quest to find the lost swords of Soargar's Legacy. The whereabouts of ''Summertongue'' remained unknown as of [[1374 DR]], but the Knights were working to recover it."
