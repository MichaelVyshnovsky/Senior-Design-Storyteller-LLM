A '''graft''' was a body part of some powerful creature or monster that was merged onto another living creature.

==Description==
[[File:Aboleth Graft - Dennis Crabapple McClain.jpg|thumb|''A [[troll]] with an [[aboleth]] graft.'']][[File:Draconic Graft - Daarken.jpg|thumb|''A [[kobold]] with a [[dragon|draconic]] graft.'']]
Grafts&mdash;which could include limbs, wings, organs, and more&mdash;could enhance the abilities of the recipient or grant them new powers. It was said that grafting was also practiced by followers of [[Torog]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Deities & Demigods: Torog, the King that Crawls|76}} by [[Draconic creature (template)|draconic]] races seeking to emulate [[dragon]]s, and by [[aboleth]]s.

Once attached, grafts did not radiate [[magic]]. A graft was never sentient, although some could act semi-independently of the recipient and others could have adverse effects on their personality or free will. A grafted body part could not be reused if removed from its original recipient.

===Creation===
Creating a graft required access to the necessary body part(s) and usually additional resources and/or [[spell]]s in order to confer the full powers of the grafted body part. Attaching a graft (either to oneself or to another creature) required skill as a healer in addition to specialized knowledge of how to graft the specific type of flesh. The procedure was generally conducted in a comfortable and quiet setting, such as an [[alchemy]] laboratory or a temple. In many cases, the secrets of certain types of grafting were closely guarded or known only to a specific group.

Some fiends possessed the ability to bestow grafts on willing individuals, and some [[necromancer]]s developed a ''[[graft flesh]]'' spell that could be used to replace limbs.

==History==
Some scholars believed that mind flayers were the first to develop the means to graft flesh to another creature, although others argued that a [[fiend of corruption]] had more likely taught the mind flayers.

During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Irritym Wonderstar]]&mdash;a [[wizard]] with ties to the [[Church of Gond]]&mdash;was recognized for the great accomplishment of grafting a still-moving metal arm onto the [[adventurer]] [[Baelam]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a group known as [[Amalgamation]] arose in [[Waterdeep]] who experimented with grafting pieces of monsters onto its members. This included everything from appending claws and tails of [[beast]]s to replacing arms with those of [[sahuagin]] to implanting [[beholder]] eyes
