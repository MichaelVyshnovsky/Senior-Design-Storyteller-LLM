Grafts&mdashwhich could include limbs, wings, organs, and more&mdashcould enhance the abilities of the recipient or grant them new powers. It was said that grafting was also practiced by followers of Torog, by draconic races seeking to emulate dragons, and by aboleths.
Once attached, grafts did not radiate magic. A graft was never sentient, although some could act semi-independently of the recipient and others could have adverse effects on their personality or free will. A grafted body part could not be reused if removed from its original recipient.
Creating a graft required access to the necessary body part(s) and usually additional resources and/or spells in order to confer the full powers of the grafted body part. Attaching a graft (either to oneself or to another creature) required skill as a healer in addition to specialized knowledge of how to graft the specific type of flesh. The procedure was generally conducted in a comfortable and quiet setting, such as an alchemy laboratory or a temple. In many cases, the secrets of certain types of grafting were closely guarded or known only to a specific group.
Some fiends possessed the ability to bestow grafts on willing individuals, and some necromancers developed a graft flesh spell that could be used to replace limbs.
Some scholars believed that mind flayers were the first to develop the means to graft flesh to another creature, although others argued that a fiend of corruption had more likely taught the mind flayers.
