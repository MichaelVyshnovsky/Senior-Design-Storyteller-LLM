A staff of crones was a magical staff that carried within it powers to inflict disease and illness upon others.
The staff itself was a shaft of rotting wood, beneath the surface of which were scores of wriggling worms. It gave off an aura of sickness, leaving its wielder feeling unwell and nauseous.
At will, the wielder of a staff of crones could emit a beam of energy that poisoned their body, an effect that continued for a matter of seconds.
