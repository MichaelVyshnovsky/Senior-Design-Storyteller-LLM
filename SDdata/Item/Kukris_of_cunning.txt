The kukris of cunning were a pair of enchanted kukris crafted by Naomlen Girdaur in the late 15 century DR.
The entirety of both kukris was crafted from pieces of masterworks once made by the Girdaur family, which had been stolen and scattered. Naomlen Girdaur methodically sought out and reclaimed these pieces before using them to exactingly design and craft the blades. As a symbol of her family and her mission, the kukris of cunning were her greatest treasures.
The blades could strike four times faster than mundane blades, and had a chance to leave injuries that gradually worsened.
