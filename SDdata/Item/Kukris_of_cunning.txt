The '''''kukris of cunning''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] [[kukri]]s crafted by [[Naomlen Girdaur]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The entirety of both kukris was crafted from pieces of masterworks once made by the [[Girdaur]] family, which had been stolen and scattered. Naomlen Girdaur methodically sought out and reclaimed these pieces before using them to exactingly design and craft the blades. As a symbol of her family and her mission, the ''kukris of cunning'' were her greatest treasures.

==Powers==
The blades could strike four times faster than mundane blades, and had a chance to leave injuries that gradually worsened.
