What a dose of universal solvent would actually do was to dissolve any adhesive or sticky material that it was applied to. This included cement and magical substances such as sovereign glue, as well as the goo from a tanglefoot bag and the adhesive made by kuo-toa.\nA single ounce of universal solvent would work on  of adhesive material. A typical container held  of fluid. If distilled to one-third of its normal potency, one ounce would cause  of organic and inorganic material to disintegrate.\nCreating it required skill at crafting magical items and the spell disintegrate.\n* Torm, a member of the Knights of Myth Drannor who was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets, owned some ultimate solution and sometimes kept it on his person.\n* Goldeyes, specialty priests of the Church of Waukeen, had a chance of receiving a vial of universal solvent as one of the miscellaneous gifts they received upon admission to the clergy."
