A rebec was a string instrument considered a precursor to the violin.
Rebecs were favored among peasants and made for very lively music.
Two- and three-string rebecs were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue produced by guild craftsmen from Selgaunt.
* The Bendekars Mercantile storehouse in Ravens Bluff had two rebecs in their instruments collection.
