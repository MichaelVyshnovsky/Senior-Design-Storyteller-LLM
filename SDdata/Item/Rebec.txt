A '''rebec''' was a string instrument considered a precursor to the [[violin]].

==Description==
Rebecs were favored among peasants and made for very lively music.

Two- and three-string rebecs were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' produced by guild craftsmen from [[Selgaunt]].

==Notable Users==
* The [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] storehouse in [[Ravens Bluff]] had two rebecs in their instruments collection.{{Cite polyhedron/98/A Handful of Dust|16}}
