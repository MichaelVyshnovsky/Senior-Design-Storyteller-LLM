Potions of invulnerability were magic potions of warding.
Potions of invulnerability were typically housed within an iron flask.
Upon drinking a potion of invulnerability, a creature would be rendered resistant to all forms of damage for the following minute.
Paste of invulnerability The people of Serôs had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion, suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a paste of invulnerability consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either clamshells or flexible tubes made from eelskin.
According to legends the potion, was first concocted for use by a king named Thorkat.
