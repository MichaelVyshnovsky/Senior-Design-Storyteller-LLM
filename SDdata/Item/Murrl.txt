'''Murrl''' was a type of a [[nut]]-based dessert commonplace in [[Chessenta]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], and [[Var the Golden]].

==Description==
Murrl was one of many types of nutty desserts found throughout the southern [[Realms]], similar to the [[Earth]]'s [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halva halva]. It was a sweet treat formed out of a ground mix of many types of nuts, a wide array of berries, and [[sesame]]. Murrl was known to be resistant to spoilage and could last through most of the year, apart from the hottest periods of time.
