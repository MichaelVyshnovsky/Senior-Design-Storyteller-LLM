Bonesaw was a surgical tool occasionally used as a weapon, that possessed a minor enchantment.
Some bonesaws bore a simple enchantment, similar to that of a +1 weapon that made it more deadly and easier to aim with. They came in a variety of designs. Some had sizable sharp teeth held in place by beautifully filigreed metalwork.
In the late 15 century DR, several of the bonesaws could be found in the House of Healing in Reithwin and in the hands of undead nurse Sister Hunna who served depraved Sharran surgeon Malus Thorm. Further north, Arla Razortongue of Luskan carried bonesaws.
