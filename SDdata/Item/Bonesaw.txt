'''Bonesaw''' was a surgical tool occasionally used as a [[weapon]], that possessed a minor [[enchantment]].

==Powers==
Some bonesaws bore a simple enchantment, similar to that of a ''+1'' weapon that made it more deadly and easier to aim with. They came in a variety of designs. Some had sizable sharp teeth held in place by beautifully filigreed metalwork.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], several of the bonesaws could be found in the [[House of Healing]] in [[Reithwin]] and in the hands of [[undead]] nurse [[Sister Hunna]] who served depraved [[Sharran]] surgeon [[Malus Thorm]]. Further north, [[Arla Razortongue]] of [[Luskan]] carried bonesaws.
