'''Shan sao fruit stew''' was a food made by the [[shan sao]], diminutive [[humanoid]]s from [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The stew was a sweetly scented concoction. It was made using various vegetables, fruit, and chunks of meat. It was known for its pleasant and delectable smell and wonderful taste.

Shan sao fruit stew was kept in hollowed-out [[gourd]]s; each had enough stew for three full meals. A single portion of shan sao fruit stew was so filling one did not feel hungry nor need another meal for 24 hours.

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Year of Discovery on the Malatran calendar, shan sao fruit stew was considered a valuable commodity in wider Kara-Tur. However, on the [[Malatran Plateau]], it was nothing more than merely a specialty type of food. In the Year of Discovery, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle met a band of strange little orange-skinned menâ€”shan sao, stranded on the Malatran Plateau. The heroes helped shan sao defend themselves against a pack of ravenous [[tiger]]s. The survivors of the scuffle rewarded them with two gourds of their delicious fruit stew.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Once Broken|12}}
