        "mainbody": "Rods of terror were enchanted rods that emitted the aura of evil, fear, and unease.\nThese rods were palpably evil even when inactive. When they were activated, rods of terror projected forward a wave of unspeakable terror on a target. This foul magic was able to affect even the most brave and unshakable heroes with the feeling of gravely dread. A fully-functional rod held fifty charges and allowed the wielder to cast fear (three charges per use) and scare (a single charge) spells.\nIn the late 14 century DR, these rods could be found throughout the Sword Coast region, notably in the cities of Neverwinter and Daggerfords Sorcellers Encapsulate."
