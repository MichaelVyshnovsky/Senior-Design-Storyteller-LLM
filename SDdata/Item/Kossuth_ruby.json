        "Description": "''Kossuth ruby'' was a red gemstone with a tiny piece of elemental flame dancing inside it, emitting a warm pulsing glow.",
        "History": "In [[1370 DR]], [[Ibbalar Thrul]], an apprentice of [[Halaster Blackcloak]], used the ''Kossuth ruby's'' elemental energies as a power source of a magical device that gave the mad wizard a small army of [[spectator]]s under his control. He used them to pester [[Waterdeep]] citizens and cause chaos within the City of Splendors. [[Khelben Arunsun]] sent his agent into the depths of Undermountain to find the lair of Ibbalar Thrul and stop the invasion. Subsequently, the [[Khelbenite]] found a way into the laboratory past the wizard's spectators and deactivated the portal by stealing the ''Kossuth ruby''. The magic gem was left with Khelben for safekeeping afterwards."
