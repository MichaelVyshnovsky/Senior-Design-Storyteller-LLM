        "mainbody": "'''Mortar''', also called '''mason mix''', was a mineral paste used in masonry to bind and seal construction blocks such as stones and bricks in buildings.",
        "Ingredients": "Most mortar was made from a mixture of [[lime (material)|lime]] (the binder), [[sand]] (the aggregate), and water. Alternatively, simple clay could be used, as in peasant houses in [[Khazari]] and [[Ra-Khati]].<ref>\n\nAs an aggregate in their mortar and adobe, the [[Azuposi]] used a silt rich in [[mica]] taken from the [[Dunobo Springs]], which was a gateway to the spirit realm of [[Wenimats]]. This made the walls of their city of [[Michaca]] sparkle in golden hues and imbued them with spiritual power.<ref>\n\nOther substances could be added for different outcomes. For example, it was widely known in [[Faerûn]] that [[gorgon]], [[medusa]], and even [[xorn]] blood mixed in mortar or stucco would block [[Astral Plane|astral]] or [[Ethereal Plane|ethereal]] travel through a wall.{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}}\n\nReputedly, a solution of two drops of [[remorhaz]] ichor and three drops of [[giant slug]] spittle added to a flask of [[amberjet]] poison and mixed with a mortar would naturally repel all [[ooze]]s and block them entering a building or going over a wall, without harming them. The formula was kept in [[Candlekeep]] and guaranteed to [[Volothamp Geddarm]] by a number of merchants, sages, and even [[Elminster]].\n\nUniquely, the mortar of the [[Dragonwall]] guarding [[Shou Lung]] was nothing less than the spirit of the great [[dragon]] [[Pao Hu Jen]]. When the dragon spirit was freed from part of the wall, the mortar between the bricks vanished and that part of the wall crumbled without its binding force.<ref><ref>\n\n[[Boggle]]s used the oil they secreted as a natural mortar to build their cubbies.",
        "Uses": "Mortars were widely used to hold together simple houses and bridges,<ref><ref> and even the biggest structures. However, not all structures used a mortar—buildings in [[Manass]] in [[Khazari]] used stacks of unmortared stone.<ref>\n\nMortar was also used as a [[material component]] in priestly [[spell]]casting.\n\nIn the [[Utter East]] during the [[Bloodforge Wars]] ([[648 DR|648]]–[[657 DR]]), a thick mortar known as mason mix was used to repair buildings damaged during the fighting and even to restore health to constructed creatures like the stone golems formed from [[basal golem]]s.",
        "Sources": "[[File:GlueMortarTar.png|thumb|right|250px|''Containers of [[glue]], mortar, and [[pitch]] from Aurora's Emporium.'']]\n[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold dry mortar used for construction at 5 [[copper piece]]s for {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}. It was said to usable with any stone material or as an exterior coating to wooden frames, and would set in an hour. They also sold a mortar powder for use in spellcasting, at 5 [[silver piece]]s for {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}.",
        "History": "According to Azuposi legend, the spirit [[Masauwu]] taught them how to build with stone, mortar, and adobe, among many other things.<ref name=\"CoG-p31>\n\nMortar was well in use in the [[Calim Empire]] by [[-6048 DR]], and was used in the construction of [[Cursrah]].<ref name=\"SoC>",
        "Notable Uses of Mortar": "The [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]], first built by [[drow]] in {{Yearlink|-2600}}, had a mortar mixed with substances designed to block scrying.\n\nIn the 4{{th}} century [[DR]], [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]] imprisoned an [[avatar]] of the god [[Moander]] called the [[Abomination of Moander|Abomination]] within his temple in [[Yûlash]]. They trapped it behind a wall built using mortar mixed with a blood that would block creatures from passing through. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the mage [[Akabar Bel Akash]] recognized the grouting as \"common enough\" and estimated it was \"mixed with gorgon blood, or something similar\".\n\nOpened in the {{YearlinkName|1188}}, the [[House of the Moon]], a temple to [[Selûne]] in [[Waterdeep]], had gorgon's blood mortar cementing the lead lining and the white [[marble]] façade of its outer walls.\n\nThe [[Diviner Guildhall|guildhall]] of the [[Diviner's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] used gorgon's blood as well as lead to prevent both scrying and extraplanar infiltration.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1476}}, when the entire garrison of paladins at [[Fort Morninglord]] disappeared, High Observer [[Thavius Kreeg]] of [[Elturgard]] ordered it sealed. All entrances were bricked up behind layers of stone and mortar."
