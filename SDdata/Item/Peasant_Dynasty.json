        "mainbody": "'''''Peasant Dynasty''''' was a common variety of [[enchanted]] [[kama]].",
        "Description": "It was richly decorated and fit for courtiers and not work in the fields.",
        "Powers": "Each of these kama bore a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the [[weapon]] towards the target and slightly increased its damage, as well as made it possible to harm creatures typically unaffected by mundane weapons. ''Peasant Dynasty'' also granted the wielder a small degree of resistance to [[acid]], cold, lightning, and fire.",
        "History": "The history behind the creation of these kama was undiscovered; however, their design led some sages to speculate that despite their markings and appearance being similar to courtly [[dagger]]s wielded by nobles and royals, the original ''Peasant Dynasty'' was created or commissioned by a courtier who rose up from the lowly life of field workers and peasantsâ€”an unusual thing that was outside the traditions of royal bloodlines.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the originals were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands."
