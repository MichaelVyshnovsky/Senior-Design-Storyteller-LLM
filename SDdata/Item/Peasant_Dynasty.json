        "mainbody": "Peasant Dynasty was a common variety of enchanted kama.\nIt was richly decorated and fit for courtiers and not work in the fields.\nEach of these kama bore a simple +1 enchantment that guided the weapon towards the target and slightly increased its damage, as well as made it possible to harm creatures typically unaffected by mundane weapons. Peasant Dynasty also granted the wielder a small degree of resistance to acid, cold, lightning, and fire.\nThe history behind the creation of these kama was undiscovered however, their design led some sages to speculate that despite their markings and appearance being similar to courtly daggers wielded by nobles and royals, the original Peasant Dynasty was created or commissioned by a courtier who rose up from the lowly life of field workers and peasantsâ€”an unusual thing that was outside the traditions of royal bloodlines.\nBy the late 14 century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the originals were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands."
