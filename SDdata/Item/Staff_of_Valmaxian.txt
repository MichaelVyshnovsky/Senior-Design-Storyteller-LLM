The '''''Staff of Valmaxian''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[wizard]]'s [[staff]] that was created by [[Valmaxian]] sometime before [[-7628 DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Staff of Valmaxian'' was a powerful magic weapon that could only be wielded by mages and [[sorcerer]]s. It possessed several enchantments, including a ''+2'' protective magic that deflected enemy blows and a ''+3'' enchantment that made the staff's damage more potent while guiding the weapon towards its target. The staff also contained several [[spell]]s that could be unleashed upon the wielder's command. These spells were: ''[[chain lightning]]'', which consumed five charges per casting, the ''[[ethereal visage]]'' spell that cost five charges, and the ''[[fireball]]'' spell â€“ three charges. At its full power, the ''Staff of Valmaxian'' held fifty charges.

==History==
This ancient staff was famously wielded by a powerful but vain and quarrelsome mage Valmaxian. He created the weapon with the aid of a [[demon]] in order to win affections of [[Chasianna]], his beloved and the daughter of Valmaxian's own long-dead master. Like all deals with [[fiend]]s, this help came with a price, and eventually, the demon came to collect what was due in the {{YearlinkName|-7628}}. It demanded Chasianna's very soul. Outraged, the mage descended into the [[Abyss]] wielding the ''Staff of Valmaxian'' and engaged in a battle with the fiend, eventually resting his beloved.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''Staff of Valmaxian'' fell into the hands of [[Thay]]an [[Red Wizard]] trader who did business from [[Thayan enclave (Neverwinter)|Thayan enclave]] in the northern city of [[Neverwinter]], built after the devastation of the [[Shadow War]].
