A Cormyrian goblinthrasher was a magic sword made in Cormyr that enabled its wielder to fight better against goblinoids.
Around 1372 DR, many of these swords were made by the War Wizards for distribution to Purple Dragon knights and for sale to the general public, on the order of Royal Magician Caladnei. Their goal was both to raise morale and to enrich the kingdoms coffers.
The Cormyrian goblinthrasher was a +1 goblinoid bane longsword.
They were decorated with the rampant purple dragon symbol of Cormyr. However, those swords awarded to knights were often personalized to the recipient with appropriate distinctions and marks of honor.
