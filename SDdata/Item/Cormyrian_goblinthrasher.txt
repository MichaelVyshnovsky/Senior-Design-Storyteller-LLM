A '''''Cormyrian goblinthrasher''''' was a magic [[sword]] made in [[Cormyr]] that enabled its wielder to fight better against [[goblinoid]]s.

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], many of these swords were made by the [[War Wizards]] for distribution to [[Purple Dragon knights]] and for sale to the general public, on the order of [[Royal Magician]] [[Caladnei]]. Their goal was both to raise morale and to enrich the kingdom's coffers.

==Powers==
The ''Cormyrian goblinthrasher'' was a ''+1 [[bane (property)|goblinoid bane]] [[longsword]]''.

==Description==
They were decorated with the rampant [[purple dragon]] symbol of Cormyr. However, those swords awarded to knights were often personalized to the recipient with appropriate distinctions and marks of honor.
