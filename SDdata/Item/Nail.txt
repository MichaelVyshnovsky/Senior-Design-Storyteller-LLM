'''Nails''' were a simple and vital kind of fastener that were used in many types of carpentry and construction in the [[Realms]]. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[spike]]s, [[rivet]]s, and [[peg]]s.

==Description==
[[File:Iron Nails.png|thumb|''Some nails.'']]
Nails were typically between {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} and {{SIAdj|4|inch|c|long=yes}} long (any longer and they were considered spikes), and were most often made from [[iron]]. Depending on their method of manufacture, they could be made with a round or square cross-section.

A common variation was the '''eye spike''', an extra-long nail that would be driven into a tree or wooden wall which could then be bent into a simple ring, such as for securing [[rope]]s.

Aside from bolts, spikes, and pegs, nails also had a strong resemblance to [[needle]]s and [[stake]]s.

==Availability==
[[File:Iron Nails 2.png|thumb|''A few more nails.'']]
Alongside other forms of common ironmongery, nails were widely produced by artisans in [[Faerûn]] to keep up with constant demand. They were often made by apprentice blacksmiths who worked on other simple, useful items such as spikes and [[hook]]s.

''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of nails and related tools in various configurations and sizes, including {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} finishing nails (2 [[sp]]/lb) and {{SIAdj|2|inch|c|long=yes}} or {{SIAdj|3|inch|c|long=yes}} joiners' nails (1 sp/lb).

==Usage==
[[File:FastenerSet.jpg|thumb|''A set of fasteners, including nails (bottom left and upper right).'']]
Nails were mainly used to join wood in carpentry or construction projects. Before being [[hammer]]ed into wood, the nail hole could be prepared using an [[awl]] to make an indentation, or partially bored out with a [[bow drill]]. Special nail hammers could be found which had a claw for ripping out nails.

Crude weapons could be enhanced by embedding metal nails within wood, such as the [[greatclub]].

Nails and pegs were commonly used for ship construction in [[Faerûn]], while in [[Zakhara]] this was avoided, with ship timbers instead sewn together with [[coconut]] fiber [[rope]]. This produced lighter ships that better handled reefs and shoals, and allowed them to survive the influence of a great [[lodestone]] deposit beneath the [[Crowded Sea]].

In the ancient [[Netherese]] city of [[Scourge (city)|Scourge]], the region's unnatural rusting winds meant that nails (and any other metal fittings, tools, and weapons) were useless. Instead, wooden nails were used for construction.

===Magic===
* ''[[Hold monster]]'' used a metal rod as a [[material component]], such as a nail or spike.
* The ''[[statue]]'' spell could be cast using a mixture of [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[sand]], and water stirred by an iron nail or spike.
