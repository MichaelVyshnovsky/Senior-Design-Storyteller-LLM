This magical fire-proofing was potent enough for the wearer to stroll atop molten rocks as if they were cold and solid. Additionally, this set of armor gave the wearer the ability to speak and understand primordial and draconic languages.\n*Artus Cimber one of the undying barae of Mezro, Artus owned a set of efreeti chainmail in the late 15 century DR."
