Alabaster was a form of gypsum that was used decoratively on interior walls of buildings or carved into fancy containers for potions, unguents, lotions, ointments, perfumes, and cosmetics.
Alabaster was brittle, but it was waterproof, had a fine-grained texture, and a pure white color that made it appealing for use as a building material or for making decorative jars. A typical price was 5 sp per lb (0.45 kg).
