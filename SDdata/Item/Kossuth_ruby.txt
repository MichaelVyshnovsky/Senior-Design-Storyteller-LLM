Kossuth ruby was a rare magical gem imbued with a spark of Kossuths elemental fire.
Kossuth ruby was a red gemstone with a tiny piece of elemental flame dancing inside it, emitting a warm pulsing glow.
In 1370 DR, Ibbalar Thrul, an apprentice of Halaster Blackcloak, used the Kossuth rubys elemental energies as a power source of a magical device that gave the mad wizard a small army of spectators under his control. He used them to pester Waterdeep citizens and cause chaos within the City of Splendors. Khelben Arunsun sent his agent into the depths of Undermountain to find the lair of Ibbalar Thrul and stop the invasion. Subsequently, the Khelbenite found a way into the laboratory past the wizards spectators and deactivated the portal by stealing the Kossuth ruby. The magic gem was left with Khelben for safekeeping afterwards.
