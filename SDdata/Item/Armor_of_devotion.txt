'''''Armors of devotion''''' were [[enchanted]] sets of [[plate mail]] [[armor]] imbued with defensive holy magics.

==Description==
Apart from their splendorous appearance, ''armors of devotion'' produced a soft hum of constant prayer to some deity.

==Powers==
When these plates were donned by a [[paladin]], the armor's ''eternal devotion'' enchantment allowed the wearer to recharge a power based on channeling their oath, once per day.

==History==
One such set of paladin's plate armor was available for purchase from [[Roah Moonglow]], a merchant of questionable morals and allegiances who worked with the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The halfling merchant was a representative of the [[Zhentarim]] who had an ''armor of devotion'' on offer during her time in the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the town of [[Reithwin]] and later, in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
