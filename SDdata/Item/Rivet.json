        "mainbody": "Rivets were metal fasteners that were used to join fabrics, leather, metal, and other materials. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included bolts, nails, and spikes.\nRivets somewhat resembled nuts and bolts, though instead of combining two separate components a rivet was a single piece, like a nail. A particularly durable and resilient version of rivet was made from an adamantine alloy.\n* Brigandine armor was created by riveting metal plates onto fabric or leather layers, creating a cheap and effective composite armor. The combined plates of field plate were typically held together by rivets, as were the component strips of metal used in splint mail. The curiously effective studded leather armor also used rivets, though instead of holding protective metal plates together, the rivets themselves were the defense.WARNING The use of rivets as a primary defensive feature, as in studded leather, is impractical and ahistorical, and should not be attempted in real life. Taking a strong impact upon a rivet attached to flexible materials such as a soft leather jerkin may result in severe bruising or cuts as the rivet is driven mercilessly into your flesh.\n* After wire was coiled into rings on a lathe and combined into interleaved links, tiny rivets would be used to pin the loops closed, creating chain mail.\n* Thaluud stone armor was a peculiar form of armor made for tomb tappers to wear. It consisted of large stone plates held together with rivets and hinges.\n* The Temple of Gond in Bezantur was made out of enormous iron plates held together with massive rivets, among other features.\nRivets were an early human invention, being used by the ancient Netherese and Calishites."
