Grogbeards Grimace was an enchanted rapier that belonged to the renowned Grogbeard the Privateer from the Nelanther Isles off the coast of the Sword Coast.
Grogbeards Grimace was enchanted to protect its wielder against spells, increasing their resistance to arcane, divine, and spell-like creature abilities.
Sometime before 1372 DR, Grogbeard the Privateer wielded the enchanted rapier that later became known as Grogbeards Grimace. The pirate was renowned post-mortem for his swashbuckling skills and the circumstances of his death. Grogbeard received a deadly wound after drinking heavily, dueling, and swinging from a ships mizzenmast. His wound festered, becoming infected, eventually ending his privateering career.
Following Grogbeard the Privateers death, the Grimace remained in the Nelanther Isles, changing hands several times over the years.
