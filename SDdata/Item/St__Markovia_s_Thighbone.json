        "mainbody": "Saint Markovias Thighbone was a remnant of Markovia, the worshiper of Morninglord and the ancient enemy of Strahd von Zarovich.\nSaint Markovias Thighbone was a club made out of the thighbone of the woman who assembled forces and attempted to slay the vampire lord of Barovia. She was defeated and locked in a tomb underneath Strahds Castle Ravenloft. Markovias divine blessing remained within her body and eventually empowered her bones.\nThis thick and sturdy enchanted bone was scribed with holy symbols of several gods.\nthumb|St. Markovias Thighbone as seen in Waterdeep in the 15 century DR.\nSt. Markovias Thighbone had an enchantment that gave the wielder a chance to heal themselves upon a successful strike. Additionally, it randomly placed the death ward spell upon the wielder of the bone club or one of their allies.\nAdditionally, the thighbone had anti-undead powers, similar to those of maces of disruption.\nIf this bone mace was used against a vampire or vampire spawn it effectively functioned as a +3 mace of disruption. It it landed a successful hit, St. Markovias Thighbone disintegrated into dust after the end of the battle.\n*Halbenet Soladonel a moon elf cleric of Corellon Larethian who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.\nSt. Markovias Thighbone wow.jpg|Halbenet Soladonel wielding St. Markovias Thighbone in combat.\nAdventures\nCurse of Strahd\nVideo Games\nWarriors of Waterdeep\nCategoryItems\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryMagic weapons\nCategoryItems from Waterdeep\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Faer√ªn\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast North\nCategoryItems from Domains of Dread\nCategoryItems from Barovia\nCategoryBone items\nCategoryClubs\nCategoryMaces\nCategoryBludgeoning weapons\nCategoryLathanderian items\nCategoryPlus-3 equivalent\nCategory2000-2999 gold pieces\n9z5y1ah1v6wcvouvpwtry2b166a5inz"
