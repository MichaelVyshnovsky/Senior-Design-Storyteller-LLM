        "Description": "''Saint Markovia's Thighbone'' was a club made out of the thighbone of the woman who assembled forces and attempted to slay the vampire lord of [[Barovia]]. She was defeated and locked in a tomb underneath Strahd's [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Markovia's divine blessing remained within her body and eventually empowered her bones.\n\nThis thick and sturdy enchanted bone was scribed with holy symbols of several gods.{{Template:Cite book/Expedition to Castle Ravenloft|216}}",
        "Powers": "[[File:St.Markovia'sThighbone.jpg|thumb|''St. Markovia's Thighbone as seen in [[Waterdeep]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].'']]\n''St. Markovia's Thighbone'' had an enchantment that gave the wielder a chance to heal themselves upon a successful strike. Additionally, it randomly placed the ''[[Death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' spell upon the wielder of the bone club or one of their allies.\n\nAdditionally, the thighbone had anti-[[undead]] powers, similar to those of ''[[mace of disruption|maces of disruption]]''.\n\nIf this bone [[mace]] was used against a [[vampire]] or [[vampire spawn]] it effectively functioned as a ''+3'' ''mace of disruption''. It it landed a successful hit, ''St. Markovia's Thighbone'' disintegrated into dust after the end of the battle.",
