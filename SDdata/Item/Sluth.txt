Sluth was a variety of sparkling white wine found in Faer√ªn. Some were known to fortify it with almond liqueur to produce the wine known as zzar.
* The House of Good Spirits, an establishment in the city of Waterdeep that was partially a winery, produced both sluth and zzar. They sold the sluth on their premises at a price of 2 copper pieces per bottle.
