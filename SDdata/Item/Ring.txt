A '''ring''' was a trinket that was placed over a finger.

==Description==
Rings were often made from different metals, such as [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]] or [[platinum]], and rarely from other materials, such as glass or bone. Some rings contained expensive [[gem]]s, or exquisite designs and etchings. Rings could be enchanted to bestow [[magic]]al powers upon their bearers. A handful of powerful rings had charges, but otherwise, their effect was everlasting. Some rings simply protected their wearers from a small amount of harm, whilst others could store extremely powerful [[spell]]s..

Anyone, provided it fitted on one of their fingers, could use a magical ring, but only two at a time could be active. If not continuously functioning, such rings were activated via a [[command word]]. A very small amount of rings possessed [[intelligent item|intelligence]].
