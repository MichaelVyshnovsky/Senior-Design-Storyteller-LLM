A ring was a trinket that was placed over a finger.
Rings were often made from different metals, such as copper, silver, gold or platinum, and rarely from other materials, such as glass or bone. Some rings contained expensive gems, or exquisite designs and etchings. Rings could be enchanted to bestow magical powers upon their bearers. A handful of powerful rings had charges, but otherwise, their effect was everlasting. Some rings simply protected their wearers from a small amount of harm, whilst others could store extremely powerful spells..
Anyone, provided it fitted on one of their fingers, could use a magical ring, but only two at a time could be active. If not continuously functioning, such rings were activated via a command word. A very small amount of rings possessed intelligence.
