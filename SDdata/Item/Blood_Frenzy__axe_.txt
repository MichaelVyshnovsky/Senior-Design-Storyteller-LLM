Blood Frenzy was an exotic dwarven waraxe that was enchanted to be especially effective against orcs.
Blood Frenzy possessed the +2 enchantment and the +5 enchantment when wielded against orcs. The waraxe also gave its owner the ability to go into blood frenzy once per day.
Blood Frenzy was a unique axe forged for a dwarven chieftain King Taik to help him keep marauding hordes of orcs that constantly menaced his underground realm. The main material of note that was used in Blood Frenzys creation was the blood of the infamous orc sorcerer called Sajifot. The blood infused the axe with the orcs innate magics and bloodthirsty nature.
The waraxe served King Taik his whole life, famously chopping the head of Kumon, the leader of the orcish horde that threatened the dwarven folk under Taiks command. The death of the orc leader effectively dispersed the horde ending the dreaded conflict for good.
Upon King Taik death, Blood Frenzy was interred along with its master within a tomb. The location of which was lost to the ages.
By 1372 DR, Blood Frenzy found its way to Daggerford where it was in stock of Dervals Bright Blade, the local smith shop that belonged to a dwarven smith Derval Ironeater.
