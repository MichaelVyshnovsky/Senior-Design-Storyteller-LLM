The '''''rod of of the monolith''''' was a magical item that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|52}}

==Description==
This item resembled a short staff.

==Powers==
The wielder of this item could control the creature released by the powerful ''[[unleash monolith]]'' spell.

The wielder could issue commands to the summoned monolith and even dismiss the creature back to its elemental plane. The elemental monolith had a chance to resist the commands of the wielder. Maintaining control of a monolith drained power from the rod during each minute of control.
