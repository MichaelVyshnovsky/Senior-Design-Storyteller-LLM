The rod of of the monolith was a magical item that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This item resembled a short staff.
The wielder of this item could control the creature released by the powerful unleash monolith spell.
The wielder could issue commands to the summoned monolith and even dismiss the creature back to its elemental plane. The elemental monolith had a chance to resist the commands of the wielder. Maintaining control of a monolith drained power from the rod during each minute of control.
