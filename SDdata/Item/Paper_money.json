        "mainbody": "'''Paper money''' was a form of [[currency]] widely used in [[Shou Lung]].",
        "Usage": "Rather than being made of precious metals such as [[silver]] and [[gold]], the notes were made of relatively worthless [[paper]], and given value by the people's trust in the issuer. As such, only a truly well-organized and well-regarded realm would be able to make use of paper money to buttress their currency.",
        "History": "Paper money was originally invented in [[Shou Lung]], and the empire was the largest user of paper currency in the [[Realms]]. Shou Lung maintained [[ch'ao]] paper notes as standard units of currency, issued in amounts of 1, 10, and 100 ch'ao.\n\nPaper money found little use elsewhere in Kara-Tur. The rich but decentralized realm of [[T'u Lung]] minted its own metal coins, [[Kozakura]] freely used foreign coins, and most other neighboring lands used limited coinage or barter, with paper notes having no cachet.\n\nPaper money found some use in the [[Hordelands]]. In the 1350s [[DR]], [[Yamun Khahan]] issued paper notes in [[Quaraband]], supplementing the traditional barter economy. Though his subjects were reluctant to use the paper money, it was used within his capital.\n\nPaper notes rarely reached the opposite end of the continent, but were known of in [[Faerûn]]. Referred to as '''bela''', it was functionally worthless and payment with it was used as a method of insult. Paper money's lack of value in Faerûn led to the saying \"Buying [[Steelpence|Steelpense]] with Bela\", indicating financial ineptitude. At best, the gaijin of Faerûn considered it an innocuous curiosity."
