        "mainbody": "A flensing gauntlet was a special type of magical spiked gauntlet.\nA flensing gauntlet looked like an old and torn untanned humanoid-skin armband and glove.\nA flensing gauntles was a +1 spiked gauntlet with one magical ability. It was activated by curling the equipped hands like a claw and could be used three times per day for six seconds each. When this happened, the gauntlet started to writhe and grow bony hooks from the fingers and palms. These hooks were dangerous to any living creature that was not incorporeal or had a gaseous body. To such creatures, a strike with a flensing gauntlet was not just more painful, it actually ripped away part of their flesh, armor was no protection against the magical nature of this property. The ripping of flesh was both physically and psychologically painful that it actually sapped the physical and mental health of the victim.\nCreating a flensing gauntlet required the casting of a flensing spell and a person who was adept at creating magical armors and weapons."
