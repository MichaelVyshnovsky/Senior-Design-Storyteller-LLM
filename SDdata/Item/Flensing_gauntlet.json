        "Description": "A ''flensing gauntlet'' looked like an old and torn untanned [[humanoid]]-skin armband and glove.",
        "Powers": "A ''flensing gauntles'' was a ''+1 spiked gauntlet'' with one magical ability. It was activated by curling the equipped hands like a claw and could be used three times per day for six seconds each. When this happened, the gauntlet started to writhe and grow bony hooks from the fingers and palms. These hooks were dangerous to any living creature that was not [[:Category:Creatures with the incorporeal subtype|incorporeal]] or had a gaseous body. To such creatures, a strike with a ''flensing gauntlet'' was not just more painful, it actually ripped away part of their flesh, [[armor]] was no protection against the magical nature of this property. The ripping of flesh was both physically and psychologically painful that it actually sapped the physical and mental health of the victim.\n\nCreating a ''flensing gauntlet'' required the casting of a ''[[flensing]]'' [[spell]] and a person who was adept at creating magical armors and weapons."
