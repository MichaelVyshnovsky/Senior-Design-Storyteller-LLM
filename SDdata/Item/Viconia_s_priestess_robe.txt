Viconias priestess robe was a powerfully enchanted Sharran robe worn by Mother Superior Viconia DeVir of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the late 15 century DR.
Viconias robes were black like Shars heart but decorated with silver metallic motifs, including a stylized shape of a spider on her open décolleté and dark golden patterns on the fabric.
The robes hummed with dark enchantments that dulled the senses, thoughts, and feelings of those around them. If one listened to the hum for a prolonged period of time, one could almost hear the chittering of a thousand spiders being devoured by a hungry darkness. It possessed a +1 protective enchantment, and Shars umbrae magic wrapped the wearer in darkness, making it easier for them to dissolve into the shadows. It also possessed a permanent Sharran veil enchantment that functioned similarly to the shield of faith spell.
Viconia DeVir came to possess her unique robes sometime before the , when she was always seen wearing the Sharran garb whilst surrounded by the faithful of the Cloister of Sombre Embrace.
