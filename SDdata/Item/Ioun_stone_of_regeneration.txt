An ioun stone of regeneration was a wondrous item that helped their owners to rapidly heal themselves.
Like other ioun stones, ioun stones of regeneration floated around their masters heads. This particular type of ioun stone had a shape of a white elongated crystal.
Ioun stones of regeneration granted their owners the boon of healing. The regenerative magics were so potent the ioun stone could pull its master from deaths door.
One of these enchanted stones came to the Sword Coast from Chult. An ioun stone of regeneration belonged to a yuan-ti malison overlord who at some point came into conflict with Raika, a half-orc barbarian from North Faerûn. She killed the overlord twice in the same battle and claimed his ioun stone.
*Raika a half-orc barbarian from the city of Waterdeep and an adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performed missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.
