An '''''ioun stone of regeneration''''' was a wondrous item that helped their owners to rapidly heal themselves.

==Description==
Like other ''[[ioun stone]]s, ioun stones of regeneration'' floated around their masters' heads. This particular type of ''ioun stone'' had a shape of a white elongated crystal.

==Powers==
''Ioun stones of regeneration'' granted their owners the boon of healing. The regenerative magics were so potent the ''ioun stone'' could pull its master from death's door.

==History==
One of these [[enchanted]] stones came to the [[Sword Coast]] from [[Chult]]. An ''ioun stone of regeneration'' belonged to a [[yuan-ti malison]] overlord who at some point came into conflict with [[Raika]], a [[half-orc]] [[barbarian]] from [[North Faerûn]]. She killed the overlord twice in the same battle and claimed his ''ioun stone''.

==Notable Owners==
*Raika: a half-orc barbarian from the city of [[Waterdeep]] and an adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performed missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
