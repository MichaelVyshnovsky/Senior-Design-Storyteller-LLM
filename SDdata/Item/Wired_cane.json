        "mainbody": "A wired cane was a tool used by some rogues when pickpocketing.\nWired canes had a thin wire connected to a leather wristband, allowing it to be \"held\" while the hand worked elsewhere. By pretending to be crippled, the rogue could approach a target without raising suspicion, and they were able to pilfer coins from the targets purse with the hand that should have been holding the cane. Their hand could then be quickly returned to the handle of the cane without ever dropping it.\nSome wired canes were hollowed out and had a hinged handle, allowing coins and small gems to be stored within the barrel of the cane.\nThe cost of a wired cane depended on the material from which it was made, but most could be acquired for 3 â€“ 10 gold."
