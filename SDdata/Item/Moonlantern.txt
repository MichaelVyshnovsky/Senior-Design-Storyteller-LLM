'''''Moonlanterns''''' were [[enchanted]] items of sadistic nature created by the [[necromancer]] ally of General [[Ketheric Thorm]], [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Moonlanterns'' were severe-looking spiked lanterns that held a single tiny creature inside – a [[pixie]]. She was tortured, surrounded by numerous painful spikes. The ''Moonlanterns''' glass was faceted and clear, with each individual facet being pierced by arrows and tendrils of glimmering moonlight. Each movement of the pixie caused her pain, and it was channeled into a brilliant chilly silver moon-like radiance that kept the dead [[Sharran]] ''[[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow-cursed]]'' at bay.

==Notable Users==
