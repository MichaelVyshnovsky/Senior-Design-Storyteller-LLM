'''''Lieutenant Talbot's Moonshine''''' was a variety of expensive magical moonshine found in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The drink was on the menu at the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern of Waterdeep, stashed away in [[Durnan]]'s cabinet. One serving of ''Lieutenant Talbot's Moonshine'' was priced at ten [[gold]] [[coin]]s.
