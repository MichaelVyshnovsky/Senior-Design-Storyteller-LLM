Starshine was a unique mithril short sword forged by the song-smith named Gehorg Diamondforge of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
This weapons had a powerful +4 enchantment placed in place that guided the wielders hand towards the target and made the axs slashes more devastating. Additionally, Starshine could detect presence of lycanthropes even when they were in their humanoid form. The wielder could also cast faerie fire, starshine, moonbeam, and lightning bolt spells from the blade.
In the , Gehorg Diamondforge and many other stores of Ravens Bluffs Market District fell victim to extortion by a group of criminals. These people—Marella, Elizza, Moamar, and Rundell—were members of the warlord Myrkyssa Jelans army that waged war on the Vast just a year prior. Gehorg spent years of his life creating weapons of great power through the ancient dwarven art of song-smithing. The master smith lost several magic weapons to the extortionists Stone Splitter, Icicle, Flame Quencher, and Starshine. This loss disillusioned Gehorg Diamondforge, and he decided to leave Ravens Bluff and its corruption unless the city was to reimburse him for the masterworks lost to the people whom he perceived to be Living City watchmen.
