Cups and mugs were commonplace pieces of crockery used in Faer√ªn for drinking liquids, like water, alcohol, or soup. They were closely related to the common mug, which were typically sturdier and had handles, and chalices and goblets, which were more ornamental and tended to have long stems.
Cups were simple handheld containers, resembling bowls. They could be made of many materials, like glass, tin, silver, or porcelain. Leather dice cups were used widely with games of chance like table dice for shaking the dice.
* "Cups" was a common slang for daublars, one of the coins of Tethyr, due to them being emblazoned with the holy symbol of Siamorphe.
