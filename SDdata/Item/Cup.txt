'''Cups''' and '''mugs''' were commonplace pieces of crockery used in [[Faer√ªn]] for drinking liquids, like water, alcohol, or soup. They were closely related to the common [[mug]], which were typically sturdier and had handles, and [[chalice]]s and [[goblet]]s, which were more ornamental and tended to have long stems.

==Description==
Cups were simple handheld containers, resembling [[bowl]]s. They could be made of many materials, like [[glass]], [[tin]], [[silver]], or [[porcelain]]. Leather dice cups were used widely with games of chance like [[table dice]] for shaking the [[dice]].

==Trivia==
* "Cups" was a common slang for [[daublar]]s, one of the [[coinage in Tethyr|coins of Tethyr]], due to them being emblazoned with the holy symbol of [[Siamorphe]].<ref>
