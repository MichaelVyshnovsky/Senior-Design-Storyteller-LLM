'''Codpieces''' were a type of front-cover for the [[breeches]] of [[human]] or [[humanoid]] males, allowing them to maintain public decency by covering their private parts.
{{quote|''Being a princess - any princess - of the Dragon Throne is not a matter of wearing pretty gowns and murmuring diplomatic nothings, of smiling and waving. [[Cormyr]] needs princesses who can think. All too many princes and noble lords conduct their reasoning only with their codpieces, so you lasses who lack them must do their thinking for them''|[[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] to [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]]}}
