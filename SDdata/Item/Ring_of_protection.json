        "mainbody": "A ring of protection was a magical device that helped keep the one who wore it from physical harm. The ring could deflect a small part of most attacks.\nRings of protection were old items, and the knowledge to create them was quite well-known. A shield of faith spell was needed in the creation, so they were made mostly by clerics.\nA radically different recipe was represented in the Imaskarran Tome of Death, which called for the spell of improved invisibility, a skeleton knuckle and the silk gland from an ettercap.\nEven though the name of the original creator of the first rings of protection was unknown, the sages liked their origins to King Castter Dewess. Several of these rings were forged to protect the Kings sons. The rings of protection remained within the Dewess family for at least 13 generations. The hostility between the creators of the rings and the Kings heirs was the supposed reason for the rings of protection disappearance from the possession of the Dewess family.\nthumb|A ring of protection from Chult.\n* Guards ring This unique ring was worn by the eternal defender of a tomb in Akanal\n* Ring of battle An enchanted ring that increased its wearers combat instincts, effectively raising their defense.\n* Ring of the princes Several of these were crafted for the numerous sons of King Castter Dewess\n* Topaz band A ring of protection of dwarven making from Myth Drannor.\n* Warders signet This ring of protection was said to have been passed from Lord Ao to the deity Helm, and down to Helms faithful in Faer√ªn"
