'''''Belts of agility''''' were enchanted [[belt]]s, famously used in the rivalry between thieves' guilds of [[Waterdeep]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Belts of agility'' were created with various enchantment strengths to the wearer's dexterity. Additionally, these enchanted belts protected its wearers from restraining magic spells and effects similar to the ''[[freedom of movement]]'' spell.

==History==
''Belts of agility'' entered heavy circulation sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] as a result of a relentless thieves' guild ears in [[Waterdeep]]. The conflict began with [[Ronger Delphos]], a wealthy merchant, creating an anti-thieves' guild employing many ex-thieves. These new members became the security experts armed with the ''[[wand of hold person|wands of hold person]]'' to capture the members of the [[Shadow Thieves|Thieves' Guild]] alive for interrogation. To counteract the wands, the Shadow Thieves guild procured the ''belts of agility''. The war between the guilds escalated, bringing many of these enchanted belts to merchants, pawnshops, and [[rogue]] equipment shops.

By [[1372]] DR, the ''belts of agility'' became quite common commodity in the [[Sword Coast]], including the cities of [[Neverwinter]]

==Notable Owners==
*[[Stran]], a shady rogue black market trader from Daggerford, ''circa'' 1372 DR.
