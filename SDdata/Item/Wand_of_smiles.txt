A '''''wand of smiles''''' was a common [[magic]]al [[wand]] that forced a creature to smile.

==Powers==
With this wand, a caster was able to target any creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. It forced the target creature to smile for one minute. The wand had three charges, which were recharged daily at dawn. There was a chance that, after using up the last charge, the wand could spontaneously become a ''[[wand of scowls]]''
