        "mainbody": "Clan Solarel daggers were enchanted blades wielded by the assassins of the elvish Clan Solarel in the late 15 century DR.\nClan Solarel daggers possessed a quality +2 enchantment to their damage and the same enchantment guided the wielders hand towards the targets. The same magic also allowed the dagger to harm creatures otherwise unaffected by mundane weapons. Each slash with such dagger dealt additional radiant damage and, when wielded against fiends, its magics effectively became a devastating +8 enchantment.\nThe elvish Clan Solarel was known as virtuois defenders of all that is good, who helmed a war against fiends and their allies. It was believed that some of the Clan Solarel daggers once pierced the demon Belaphoss. In the ate 15 centur DR, a gang of Clan Solarel assassins attacked the Champion of the Burning Dawn and their allies, mistakingly believing them to be thralls of Belaphoss. The assassins were defeated, leaving behind a damaged Clan Solarel dagger that may had eventually been reforged by a master from Luskan, using shards of the similar weapons found in the lair of Rhylfang."
