        "mainbody": "Bowls were a common piece of crockery found everywhere in Faer√ªn.\nBowls were a fundamental part of kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and serving meals (often with a spoon), especially those like soups, stews, and porridge, and a standard part of the mess kit used by travelers. Cheap, common bowls were made from wood, but finer crockery was made of ceramics such as porcelain, often with decorative glazing that made them into works of art.\nMortars were special bowls used for grinding materials into powder, while braziers were essentially large metal bowls used for holding burning fuel.\n* Bowl of blood, a magic bowl that produced blood.\n* Bowl of commanding water elementals, a magical bowl that controlled water elementals.\n* Bowl of watery death, a variety of magical bowls that looked identical to a bowl of commanding water elementals but were actually deadly traps for anyone that dared to use them."
