A potion of vitality was a very rare potion that removed some sort of exhaustion that the imbiber was suffering from.
The fluid associated with this potion was crimson, and pulsed with a small amount of light, similar to a beating heart.
When consumed, the imbiber of such a potion was no longer exhausted, i.e., they were no longer hungry, ill, or poisoned. After resting, the imbiber may have felt more rested and healthy than normal.
The effects of these potions could be replicated by casting healing spells onto a honeystone.
One of the possible ingredients for crafting these potions were coffee beans.
