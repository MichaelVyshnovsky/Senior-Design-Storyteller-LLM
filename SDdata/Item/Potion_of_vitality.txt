A '''''potion of vitality''''' was a very rare [[potion]] that removed some sort of exhaustion that the imbiber was suffering from.

==Description==
The fluid associated with this potion was crimson, and pulsed with a small amount of light, similar to a beating heart.

When consumed, the imbiber of such a potion was no longer exhausted, ''i.e.'', they were no longer hungry, [[disease|ill]], or [[poison]]ed. After resting, the imbiber may have felt more rested and healthy than normal.

The effects of these potions could be replicated by casting healing [[spell]]s onto a [[honeystone]].

==Creation==
One of the possible ingredients for crafting these potions were [[coffee]] beans.
