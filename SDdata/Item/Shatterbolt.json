        "History": "''Shatterbolt'' was created by an unnamed but skilled gnome bowyer who impressed everyone, even himself with the construction of this heavy crossbow. He organized an event to show the device off to his fellow gnomes, where he continuously shot ''Shatterbolt'' at target barrels, making them explode into splinters with each hit. Unfortunately for the event's attendees, the barrels were filled with water and showered them after each explosive presentation. One of the attendees was a [[half-orc]] bounty hunter, who was not amused by the water-soaked annoyance.\n\nAfter the show was over, the bounty hunter followed the gnome bowyer home and murdered him with just one hit of her [[handaxe]], ending the gnome's career as an inventor and entertainer. She claimed ''Shatterbolt'' for herself.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], ''Shatterbolt'' had found its way to [[Daggerford]] where it was among the stock of [[Derval's Bright Blade]], the local smith shop that belonged to [[Derval Ironeater]]."
