Doorknocker was an enchanted bludgeon once wielded by an explorer named Pasi sometime before the late 14 century DR.
This club possessed magics that dealt additional bludgeoning damage to its targets and discharged a knock spell onto locked objects when struck against them.
Doorknocker accompanied its mistress, the tiefling adventurer Pasi, into dangerous treasure-hunting delves to Tier Lathadun‎ where its magic came in handy dispatching undead monsters and opening ancient locked doors. Some years before the , Pasi met her doom in Tier Lathadun‎ after she slipped and plummeted to her death. Her body and the weapon were thought to be lost, until Doorknocker reappeared within a chest in Umgatliks shrine on the Crabs Claw Coast in 1372 DR, which was being excavated by a group of Waterdhavian archeologists.
