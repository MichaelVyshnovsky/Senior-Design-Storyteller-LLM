A '''swineherd's crook''' was a staff often wielded by [[swineherd]]s to wrangle [[pig]]s.

==Description==
These staves were {{SI|8|feet|long=yes}} long with a large crook at the end. These crooks were larger than the average [[shepherd's crook]] owing to the fact that pig necks tended to be larger than [[sheep]] necks. Some swineherd crooks also featured a nasty {{SIAdj|6|inch|c|long=yes}} [[iron]] spike on the base, which was used to prod the swine or to knock pig food like [[acorn]]s out of trees.

While not a weapon, it could be wielded as such, either using the iron spike

==Notable Owners==
* [[Swithin Sigirdson]] of [[Hog Hill]] was known to carry a swineherd's crook while he accompanied his hogs as they foraged for [[mushroom]]s and small animals in [[the Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|15}}
