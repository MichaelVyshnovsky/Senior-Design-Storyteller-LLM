A swineherds crook was a staff often wielded by swineherds to wrangle pigs.
These staves were  long with a large crook at the end. These crooks were larger than the average shepherds crook owing to the fact that pig necks tended to be larger than sheep necks. Some swineherd crooks also featured a nasty  iron spike on the base, which was used to prod the swine or to knock pig food like acorns out of trees.
While not a weapon, it could be wielded as such, either using the iron spike
