'''''Ice Claw''''' was an ''[[intelligent item|intelligent]], +3 [[frostbrand]] [[short sword]]'' that was crafted by [[dwarves]] of [[the north]] in their fight against [[dragon]]s of the region.{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}

==Description==
This unique sword had a polished, almost-white blade that was cool to touch. Its pommel was twined [[silver]] and [[adamantite]] with a [[diamond]] set within.

==Powers==
Possessing the [[item enchantment|enchantment]]s of a ''+3 frost brand'', ''Ice Claw'' had a special purpose of defeating dragons of any [[alignment]], protected its wielder from these [[magical beast]]s, and granted them immunity to their area of fear.

==History==
''Ice Claw'' was forged centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]] when the dwarves of [[Citadel Adbar]] sought to stave off the repeated attacks of dragons from the [[Ice Mountains]]. It was kept in the personal armory of the Dwarf King and occasionally bestowed upon particularly worthy champions when they embarked on quests for the realm. Dwarven lore claimed the blade had slain a dragon and at least three [[fiend]]s during its generations of use. Some time before the mid 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the last hero who bore the storied blade for the Kingdom lost it after failing his appointed quest.

The fabled weapon was lost for over 40 years, before it wound up in the possession of a small-time mercenary, [[Farzahd|Captain Farzahd]]. It remained with him until he attempted to force himself on an [[elven]] [[sorcerer]] named [[Ulshanya]], when she killed him and took ''Ice Claw'' for herself.
