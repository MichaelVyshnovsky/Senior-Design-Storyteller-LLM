A '''dragoncraft item''' was a special item made from the body parts of a [[dragon]].

==Description==
As mentioned above, dragoncraft items were items made from dragon body parts. Naturally, depending on which body part was used, the item had a different appearance. The body parts that could be used for dragoncraft items were the blood, bones, fangs, and hide.

==Powers==
Dragoncraft items were treated in a special way by the creator so that they derived some power from the creature whose body parts were used as its material. The blood of a dragon could be brewed into a substance that when imbibed increased the imbiber's physical strength and temporarily conferred some powers related to the kind of dragon the blood came from. A large bone could be used to create a bow that could shoot farther than one made from ordinary material and also be made to channel any level of physical strength for shooting. Specially treated [[dragonhide]] actually conferred some additional protective qualities to the wearer. A dragon fang could be turned into an edged weapon that dealt additional damage using energy in the form of the [[dragon breath|dragon's breath]]. All these powers were fully innate and even worked within an ''[[antimagic field]]''.

==Reputation==
Specialized skill and knowledge was required to craft a dragoncraft item. Learning this skill required some knowledge in the [[The Art|arcane arts]].
