Most of these amulets appeared as a golden disk hanging from a chain. The disk usually was engraved with the image of a lion or other powerful beast. They bore a transmutation aura of moderate strength.

Amulets of health could be crafted at various levels of power, which would enhance the wearers health by different factors.
Depending on the power of the amulet, such an item could sell for as little as 4,000 gold pieces or as much as 36,000.
