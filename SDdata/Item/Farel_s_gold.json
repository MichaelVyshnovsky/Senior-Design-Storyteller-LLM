        "Powers": "''Farel's gold'' bullets were created out of gold and possessed two enchantments: upon collision they released acid, dealing additional damage, and had a coin-toss chance of affecting the target with the ''[[slow]]'' spell for twelve seconds.",
        "History": "''Farel's gold'' bullets were invented by [[Farel Harod]] of [[Amn]] during one of his lengthy expeditions into a deadly dungeon. He ran out of bullets and decided to use his gold [[coin]]s instead, somehow he realized that he preferred them to regular bullets. After he escaped the perils of the dungeon he commissioned improved version of these expensive bullets. Since then, ''Farel's gold'' bullets have been appearing all over place, including the city of [[Neverwinter]], [[Sword Coast]]."
