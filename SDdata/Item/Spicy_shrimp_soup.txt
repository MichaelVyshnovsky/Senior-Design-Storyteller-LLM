'''Spicy shrimp soup''' was a specialty dish served at the eateries of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
There were many variations on the [[spice|spicy]] recipe. Each tavern and each eatery in the city had their own version. However, some [[bowl]]s were only to be eaten at your own risk.

==Availability==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], spicy [[shrimp]] soup was cooked not only in Baldur's Gate but also in the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The [[wizard]] named [[Cyrel]] had a bowl of this concoction during her hunt for the [[tiefling]] named [[Karlach]] on the behest of [[Zariel]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
