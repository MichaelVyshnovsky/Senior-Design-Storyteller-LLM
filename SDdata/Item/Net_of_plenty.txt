The '''''net of plenty''''' was a [[magic item]] that originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, and was prized by fishermen.

==Description==
This item looked like a regular fisherman's [[net]].

==Powers==
When cast into fresh water or sea water, the ''net of plenty'' would always snare enough fish to feed the user and an additional 1-3 people.

The net possessed another wondrous ability. Once per week the user could shake the net and instantly release up to 500 gallons (1900 liters) of water, sufficient enough to douse a decent-sized fire.
