The net of plenty was a magic item that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, and was prized by fishermen.
This item looked like a regular fishermans net.
When cast into fresh water or sea water, the net of plenty would always snare enough fish to feed the user and an additional 1-3 people.
The net possessed another wondrous ability. Once per week the user could shake the net and instantly release up to 500 gallons (1900 liters) of water, sufficient enough to douse a decent-sized fire.
