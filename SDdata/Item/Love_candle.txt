A love candle was a special magic item made by mystics in the Realms. It caused individuals to be charmed by and possibly enamored with the first creature they saw after the candle was extinguished.
This was the first candle that a mystic learned to make when they began their practice of candle magic. The love candle was red in color and was intended to be burnt in ten-minute intervals. The longest-lasting candle that could be made burned for ninety minutes.
After burning for the desired amount of time and then being extinguished (either by blowing, snuffing, dousing, or reaching the end of its wick), the love candle caused an effect similar to a highly potent philter of love. The subject(s) became charmed by the first creature they saw and remained charmed one day for every ten minutes the love candle was allowed to burn. This effect worked flawlessly on humans, elves, half-elves, demihumans, humanoids, and fey, even if they were normally immune or resistant to charm. As a side-effect, individuals under the influence of a love candle were likely to become enamored of their first-sighted, especially if they were of similar race and sexually compatible.
The subject(s) had to remain within ten feet (three meters) of the burning candle for the entire time it was lit and when it was extinguished, or that application of the candle was wasted. The charm effect could not be removed prematurely by anything less than a limited wish or alter reality spell. The enamoring effect, if it occurred, lasted until a sufficiently strong dispel magic was cast on the individual, or by similar magics.
