'''''Doomthresher''''' was a double-headed [[flail]] that was the [[weapon]] wielded by the avatar of [[Urogalan]], the [[halfling]] [[deity]] of earth and death.<ref name=frcs-3e-p240">

==Powers==
This flail, which had two heads, had a ''+3'' enchantment. When a creature was struck by it and failed to resist its effects, the creature was petrified via ''[[flesh to stone]]''. In addition, ''Doomthresher'' had the properties of a ''[[mace of disruption]]'' when it was used against the [[undead]]. As such, it could instantly destroy lesser undead.
