        "Description": "[[File:Sage of cormyr.png|thumb|''A sage of [[Cormyr]] and the mysterious domino mask.''|385x385px]]\nMost ''domino masks'' from Westgate were black in color and astonishingly thin pieces of delicate fabric with two oval eye slits. These [[mask (object)|masks]] covered the top portion of the wearer's face and held in place with a thin braided cord. They were functional and elegant enough to adorn the face of a wealthy masquerade goer.",
        "Powers": "At least one of Westgate's ''domino masks'' was imbued with mysterious magics that made even losing it uncomfortable, as if one could feel the sinister secrets held within.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, ''domino masks'' were used by most Night Masks of Westgate to identify their ilk, announce the guild's territory, and intimidate those who opposed them. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, an adventurer found a seemingly cursed ''domino mask'' in a dungeon among its treasures. The mask, obviously magical, called to the adventurer, but once it was picked up, the mask refused to be discarded, forcing the adventurer into holding on to the mysterious item whilst plaguing the unlucky dungeon dweller with nightmares of ghostly wraiths and suffering of restless nights. Desperate for answers, the adventurer sought the counsel of a [[Cormyr]]ean sage who pointed his finger towards the city Westgate and the Night Masks."
