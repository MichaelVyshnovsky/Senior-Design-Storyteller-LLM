        "mainbody": "'''''Nolzur's marvelous pigments''''' was a [[magic item]] that enabled an artist to create real things out of paintings.",
        "Powers": "When placed upon an artist's [[paintbrush]], these pigments flowed from the brush to create a real item based upon whatever the wielder concentrated upon. This process took ten minutes. A single pot of this magical pigment had enough material to create up to {{SI|1000|cu ft}} over a {{SI|100|sq ft}} area.\n\nOnly mundane inanimate objects could be created with this pigment, including all manner of food, and acted as expected. Alchemical items could also be created, such as [[tanglefoot bag]]s.<ref> However, [[magic item]]s and creatures could not be created, regardless of whether they were mundane creatures, magical creatures, or [[construct]]s such as [[golem]]s. Plants, such as flowers and [[tree]]s, could also be depicted. Following the [[Spellplague]], copies of ''Nolzur's marvelous pigments'' lost the power to create plants, but regained the power to do so following the [[Second Sundering]].\n\nIf objects with any significant value were depicted, such as [[gem]]s, [[jewelry]], [[ivory]], or so on - the item would look authentic and maintain the appearance of luxury, but be made of more inexpensive materials such as bone, [[brass]], [[lead]], [[tin]], etc. Following the Second Sundering, it was found that this stipulation applied to objects that were valued roughly over 25 [[gold piece]]s.",
