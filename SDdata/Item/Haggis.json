        "Description": "Haggis was a boiled [[sausage]]-like dish. The casing was a [[sheep]]'s stomach, filled with sheep's minced organ meats: liver, heart, and lungs, as well as the animal's regular meat. Additionally, the mince was stretched with [[oatmeal]] and flavored with [[onion]]s and [[spice]]s.\n\nHaggis was believed to be as old as halflings themselves. \"Neeps\" and \"tatties\" were traditional side dishes served alongside haggis by the hin.",
        "Availability": "Apart from the Western Heartlands, haggis was served at [[The Happy Stein]] tavern in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]]."
