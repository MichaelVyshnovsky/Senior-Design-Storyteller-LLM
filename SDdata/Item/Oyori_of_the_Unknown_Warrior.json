        "mainbody": "The Oyori of the Unknown Warrior was a unique set of enchanted Kozakuran armor, created sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nThe Oyori of the Unknown Warrior was a set of heavy armor of Kozakuran design. Before being donned for the first time, this ō-yoroi was bright white. Once it was put on by its owner, its color turned black, and it displayed the wearers family mon, or crest, in the appropriate colors.\nThe Oyori of the Unknown Warrior changed its color from white to black and was decorated differently for each new owner. When the wearer of the ō-yoroi was killed, the image of the family crest and the black color turned back to stark white—the color of mourning. The wearer could tap into the armors magic to change its appearance in order to aid them with infiltration and disguise, imitating other colors and crests from the wearers mind. Additionally to that property, the Oyori of the Unknown Warrior possessed a potent defensive +2 enchantment."
