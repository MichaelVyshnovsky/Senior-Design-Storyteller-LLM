Dancers Silhouette was a type of powerful enchanted light armor created specifically for shadowdancers use.
These sets of armor were intricately and ingeniously designed to be silent and allow full range of movement while protecting thee wearer from backstabbing. The armors joints were completely soundless while linking the armor pieces together.
Dark and silent, these items possessed powerful +6 enchantments and drastically improved the wearers silent movement skill. Additionally, Dancers Silhouette allowed the wearer to cast the silence spell once per day. An average set of Dancers Silhouette held three charges of the spell.
In the late 14 century DR, these rare pieces of magic armor began appearing in the locations within the dreaded Underdark and even reached the Moonsea region. In 1372 DR, a djinn merchant Volkarion possessed a set of Dancers Silhouette during his time in Undermountain.
