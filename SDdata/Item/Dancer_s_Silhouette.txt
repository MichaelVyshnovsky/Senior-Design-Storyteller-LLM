'''''Dancer's Silhouette''''' was a type of powerful [[enchanted]] [[light armor]] created specifically for [[shadowdancer]]s' use.

==Description==
These sets of armor were intricately and ingeniously designed to be silent and allow full range of movement while protecting thee wearer from backstabbing. The armor's joints were completely soundless while linking the armor pieces together.

==Powers==
Dark and silent, these items possessed powerful ''+6'' enchantments and drastically improved the wearer's silent movement skill. Additionally, ''Dancer's Silhouette'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[silence]]'' spell once per day. An average set of ''Dancer's Silhouette'' held three charges of the spell.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these rare pieces of magic armor began appearing in the locations within the dreaded [[Underdark]] and even reached the [[Moonsea]] region. In [[1372 DR]], a [[djinn]] merchant [[Volkarion]] possessed a set of ''Dancer's Silhouette'' during his time in [[Undermountain]].
