Cherrybread, also known as the Vilholn Cherrybread on the Sword Coast, was a sweet molasses bread with diced and alcohol-soaked cherries, popular in the Vilhon Reach, Border Kingdoms, and the region of the Sea of Fallen Stars, with its popularity reaching the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR.
Even though Vilholn cherrybread was mostly made with cherries, the original dish, popular in the Border Kingdoms and Vilhon could be made with various types of fruit, finely diced and marinated in spirits. The ready bread was often sold as a whole loaf or per slice, wrapped in leaves to keep it moist.
