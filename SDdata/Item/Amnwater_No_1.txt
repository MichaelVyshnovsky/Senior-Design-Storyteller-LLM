}}'''Amnwater No.1''' was a [[beer]] exported from the town of [[Amnwater]] and could be found throughout [[North Faer√ªn]] and [[Sword Coast]].

==History==
By 1370s DR this expensive beer from a tavern that grew into a major trade way stop was found all along the Sword Coast and the [[Trade Way]]. In Liam's Hold's [[Holdfast Inn]] this beer was sold under a dignified name Guest Beer! Amnwater No1.
