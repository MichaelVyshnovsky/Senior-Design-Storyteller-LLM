        "mainbody": "A scarab versus golems, known as a golembane scarab by , was a type of enchanted pin that was designed to help combat golems.\nThis pin was in the shape of a scarab.\nThese pins bestowed two powers upon their wearer. The first was the ability to detect any form of golem within  of the wearer, though they had to concentrate. Their second power enabled a wearer to harm golems with any form of weapon, overcoming their immunity to non-magical weapons.\nWhen it came to the second power, there were different types of pins that could affect golems. Most affected only a single type of golem. The second most expensive affected flesh golems, clay golems, and wood golems. And the most expensive type affected all forms of golem.\nThese scarabs could be to form anvils of darkness, which were used to construct doom guards.\nThese scarabs required only a sufficiently experienced creator who knew the detect magic spell in order to successfully assemble one.\n* Valmous"
