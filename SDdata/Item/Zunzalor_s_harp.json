        "mainbody": "unzalors harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers.\nWhen played, Zunzalors harp illuminated magical items and effects. A pearly white,  radius continual light globe appeared around the harp, and while in this area, the harps powers continuously dispelled illusions and invisibility, and revealed glyphs and symbols. All magical or illusory runes, marks, or inscriptions within the area (even those hidden or made unreadable by magic) were outlined in blue light, and they could be located and identified, or sketched for future study, given expert knowledge or reference material. However, the harps revealing power did not activate them or prevent them from functioning normally if triggered by touch or other conditions.\nInvisible, intangible, magic-using, gaseous, wraith-like, and duo-planar creatures were also outlined in blue radiance if they made contact with the globe of radiance, including shadows, gaseous vampires, undead that drained energy because of their connection with the Negative Material plane, phase spiders (even if not phasing during contact), ethereal creatures, and mages using duo-dimension spells (who appeared as thin vertical lines of blue radiance in mid-air).\nZunzalors harp originated from the ancient city of Myth Drannor."
