A cloak of the shield was a type of magical cloak that offered significant protection to its wearer.
Each cloak of the shield possessed a number of charges, one of which was used when the cloaks powers were activated. When a charge was expelled, the wearer was surrounded by a sphere of protective energy that turned away physical projectiles and slowed attacks made with melee weapons.
* Durlag Trollkiller, the famous dwarven adventurer kept one of these cloaks within his tower.
* Firkraag, the red dragon who made his lair in Amn.
