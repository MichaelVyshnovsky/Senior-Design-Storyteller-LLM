A '''''cloak of the shield''''' was a type of [[magic]]al [[cloak]] that offered significant protection to its wearer.

==Powers==
Each ''cloak of the shield'' possessed a number of charges, one of which was used when the cloak's powers were activated. When a charge was expelled, the wearer was surrounded by a sphere of protective energy that turned away physical projectiles and slowed attacks made with [[:category:melee weapons|melee weapons]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Durlag Trollkiller]], the famous [[dwarven]] adventurer kept one of these cloaks within his [[Durlag's Tower|tower]].
* [[Firkraag]], the [[red dragon]] who made his lair in [[Amn]].
