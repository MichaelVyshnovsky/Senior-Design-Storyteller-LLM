Querns were scientific items in the Realms often used by wizards to grind substances into fine powder at a much faster rate than if they used a mortar and pestle.
A quern resembled a much smaller version of a millers wheel that could be operated by hand via a small handle located at the top.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 20 gold pieces.
* Querns were favored by wizards.
