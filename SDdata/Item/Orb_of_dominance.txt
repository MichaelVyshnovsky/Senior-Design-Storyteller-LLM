Orbs of dominance, were wizardly orb implements that greatly boosted the wielders magical prowess, popularized in the 15 century DR.
Flaming orbs helped wizards to focus their arcane energies, increasing the destructive power of their spells. Additionally, these orbs quickened the wielders reaction and allowed them to find vulnerabilities in the spell targets.
In the 15 century DR, various orbs of dominance could be found among spellcasters of the Sword Mountains, areas surrounding the city and markets of Neverwinter. One such item was among Fletcher Thanes possessions in the late 15 century DR, another was in the undead hands of the vampire lord Ozit who laired in the ruined Illefarn.
