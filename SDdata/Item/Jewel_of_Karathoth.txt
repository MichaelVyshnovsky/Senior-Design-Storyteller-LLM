The '''''jewel of Karathoth''''', which was also called '''''Karathoth's jewel''''', was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[gemstone]] that was created by an incarnation of [[Thoth]].

==Description==
The gemstone had between five and eight facets.

==Powers==
''Karathoth's jewel'' could be used to create an exact duplicate of whoever held the jewel. The duplicate was under the complete control of the wielder for 40–70 minutes before vanishing. When a duplicate was killed or vanished, a single facet of the jewel would crack and could not be used again. The ''jewel of Karathoth'' became useless when all of the facets cracked. A single duplicate could be created at a time, and two days of waiting were required before the jewel could be used again.

Any [[magic item]]s carried by the duplicate disappeared with them, but the effects of [[spell]]s cast by them remained active upon their disappearance. Duplicates could not use [[creation]] [[magic]] or cast ''[[wish]]''.
