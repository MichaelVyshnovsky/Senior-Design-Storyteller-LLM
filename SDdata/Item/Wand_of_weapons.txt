A '''''wand of weapons''''' was a [[wand]] used by the [[Harpers]].

==Powers==
A ''wand of weapons'' empowered its user to summon [[weapon]]s into specific locations. To utilize its power, the user was required to mentally select a target being within their line of sight, envision a desired weapon, and then uttered a [[command word]]. Upon activation, the envisioned weapon materialized instantly in front of the targeted creature and hovered in mid-air.

These summoned weapons were temporary magical constructs, vanishing into nothingness after the magical effect of the wand expired. They possessed exceptional craftsmanship and remained weightless and unbreakable. The summoned weapon appeared near the targeted creature's midsection, aligning with their current facing direction. Although another creature could grasp and utilize the weapon, the wand wielder held the ability to instantly dissolve it through an act of will.

A ''wand of weapons'' allowed for the simultaneous delivery of multiple weapons to a targeted creature. In the event that the intended recipient failed to take hold of any of the summoned weapons, they found themselves encircled by an array of floating weaponry.

A ''wand of weapons'' was capable of creating the following weapons:
* [[Dagger]]
* [[War pick|Footman's pick]]
* [[Warhammer]]
* [[Footman's flail]]
* [[Handaxe|Hand]] or [[throwing axe]]
* [[Long sword]]
* [[Footman's mace]]
* [[Battle axe]]
* [[Bastard sword]]
* [[Morning star]]
* [[Two-handed sword]]
* [[Bill]]
* [[Spear]]
* [[Halberd]]
