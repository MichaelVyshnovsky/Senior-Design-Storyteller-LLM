The '''Shroud of Souls''' was a powerful [[artifact]] capable of calling the spirits of the dead.

==History==
The [[Doomguide]]s of [[Kelemvor]] obtained the Shroud of Souls at an unknown time before the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]. As they could not destroy it, they instead sealed it within a crypt below [[Neverwinter]]'s [[River District]]. At one point, [[Arklem Greeth]]'s apprentice [[Morlanth]] located the Shroud of Souls, but was trapped in the crypt by the wards. Over time, the Shroud's magic turned her into a [[shade]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[illusionist]] [[Lukan]] accidentally broke the wards, freeing Morlanth. She used the Shroud to recall the spirits of the Doomguides buried within the crypt as [[ghost]]s, [[shadow]]s, and [[wraith]]s, then brought it to the [[Shard of Night]] and attempted to use it to raise the spirits of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] as wraiths under her command. She was slain by adventurers before she could complete the ritual, and the Shroud was delivered to [[Kavatos Stormeye]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] for safekeeping.
