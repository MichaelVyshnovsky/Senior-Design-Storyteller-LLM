        "mainbody": "'''''Dymondheart''''' was the [[Nentyarch]]'s sword. On {{yearlink|1373}}, he bestowed it upon the [[Nentyar huntress]] [[Elowen]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|127-128|13}}",
        "Description": "''Dymondheart'' was a sword made of a single block of gleaming wood. It appeared as if darkly oiled, with the wooden grain running with the length of the blade. When it was swung, the air whistled as it parted.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|132|14}}",
        "Powers": "The sword's edge was hard to dull.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|159|16}} Against some demons, the blade strobed green, causing their hide to erupt in green flame by simply brushing them.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|193|19}} Against greater demons, their skin peeled itself back on contact.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|198|20}}\nThe blade had defensive powers as well, being able to prevent attacks with a flash of light, but such things caused it to expend its charge.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|207|21}} but it could regain its charge by being exposed to sunlight.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|252-253|27}}\nThe blade also had the power to launch rays of powerful radiance like that of the sun, down to the ability to annihilate vampires.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|285-286|30}}\n\nFor a wielder with some knowledge of history, fluency in the elven language, and fair skill at arms, Dymondheart could also progress differently, showing other powers.{{cite book/Weapons of Legacy|79}}",
        "History": "''Dymondheart''  grew fully formed out of the trees in [[The Close]]. This was a gift from the green powers, gods of the wild, a signal of favor and approval. The blade was passed down from Nentyarch to Nentyarch, being instrumental in keeping the Nar fiends beneath [[Dun-Tharos]] sealed. At some point, one Nentyarch lost it in the ruins beneath; the Nentyarch in {{yearlink|1373}} had recovered the sword in his youth, almost at the cost of his own life.{{cite book/Weapons of Legacy|78}}\nIn {{yearlink|1373}}, the Nentyarch gave the sword to [[Elowen]] before sending her to accompany [[Marrec]] and [[Araluen]] in their quest against the [[Rotting Man]].",
