Best hope it don't take a fancy to you...unless you like playin' hide an' seek when yer tryin' to take a dump.|The goblin [[Skrut]].}}",
        "Description": "A ''scrying eye'' resembled a glassy lidless eye that floated some height above the ground.",
        "Powers": "Some ''scrying eyes'' were crafted with ''[[truesight]]'', allowing them to see through [[illusion]]s and into the [[ethereal plane]].\n\nAnyone gazing into, and being viewed by, the eye could reach out to feel a connection with whomever or whatever was on its \"other side\". Tapping into that connection may see their own image reflected in the eye, falling into itself into eternity.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Cult of the Absolute|cultists of the Absolute]] from [[Moonrise Towers]] used ''scrying eyes'' to keep appraised of their subordinates in the [[Shattered Sanctum]] and [[Grymforge]].",
        "Notable Owners": "Some [[archfey]] were known to utilize ''scrying eye''s."
