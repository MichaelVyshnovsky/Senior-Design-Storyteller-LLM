        "mainbody": "The Bow of Eletha was an enchanted bow once carried by the elf warrior Eletha.\nThis bow doubled the normal range of any arrow it shot. It also caused any arrow to inflict more physical harm upon targets. The bows final power was that it could convert a normal arrow into a blast of energy similar to the magic missile spell as if it were cast by a skilled wizard. This power could be used up to three times per day."
