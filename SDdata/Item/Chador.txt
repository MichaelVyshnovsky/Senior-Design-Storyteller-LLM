A chador (pronounced "SHAH-dor") was a type of robe worn by some women of Zakhara. and Calimshan.
These robes covered a womans entire body and came with hoods and special face-coverings that allowed the wearer to see clearly while still shielding her eyes from view. This garment was common in regions where moralists had power. Chadors were available in white for unmarried women, black for married women, and red for widows.
Underneath a chador, a woman would wear trousers, a blouse, and a tunic, and sometimes a vest, or they would wear a caftan.
A typical chador sold for 8 silver pieces.
