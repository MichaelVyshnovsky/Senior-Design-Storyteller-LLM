'''''Hsskala''''' ("nearkill" in the [[Common]] tongue) was a [[positoxin]] that would render an [[undead]] creature unconscious.

It was created by the [[half-fiend]] [[yuan-ti]] [[Kharantes]], who used to in [[1375 DR]] to render the [[sarrukh]] lord, [[King Oreme]], incapacitated. Kharantes plan was foiled shortly thereafter by a group of adventurers seeking King Oreme for his council.
