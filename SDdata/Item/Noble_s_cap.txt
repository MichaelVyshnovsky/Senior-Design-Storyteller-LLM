'''''Noble's caps''''' were minor magic items used by the nobility of large cities such as [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These hats appeared quite mundane but had minor [[enchantment]] weaved into their fabric. ''Noble's caps'' subtly affecter the wearer's appearance and charisma making them more attractive and persuasive.

==History==
Many believed that ''noble's caps'' were created by an unnamed enchanted in a rush. The wizard grabbed a first hat they saw and quickly placed enchantments on them to wiggle out of a tight spot.

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''noble's caps'' were in wide use in such cities as Neverwinter of the [[Sword Coast]], and as far south as the city of [[Samargol]] in [[Samarach]].
