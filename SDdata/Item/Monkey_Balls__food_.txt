==Description==
The recipe made around forty Monkey Balls. The ingredients for the treat were mixed in two batches. The first batch was a mix of half a cup of [[peanut butter]], one-third of a cup of [[honey]], half a cup of [[granola]], half a cup of crushed "cheery" cereal, half a cup of [[oatmeal]], a dash of [[nutmeg]] and [[cinnamon]]. The second batch was a mix of a cup of [[sugar]], a quarter cup of [[cocoa]], a quarter cup of [[butter]], a quarter cup of [[milk]], and a dash of [[vanilla]].

The first batch's ingredients were mixed, leaving oatmeal out, and rolled into [[coin]]-sized bills that were then rolled in oats. The second batch was all boiled together for three and a half to four minutes. When smooth, the mix was taken off the heat and used to dip Monkey Balls in. These treats were served along with a [[Monkey Balls (poem)|poem]] of the same name being recited.

==History==
The recipe for Monkey Balls was recorded in the recipe book of Dradeel's during his accommodations within the [[Spellhold]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
