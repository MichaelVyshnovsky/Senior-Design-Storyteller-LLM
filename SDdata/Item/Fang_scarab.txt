A fang scarab was a medallion that gave any spider that wore it the ability to hear the dark whispers of Lolth and guide it in battle. However, any non-spider who wore the medallion found it would fuse to their neck and slowly transform them into a half-spider creature.
Made of crystal and shaped like a fang, a fang scarab typically hung from a finely crafted silver chain. The chain was designed to fit over a spiders head and body.
They were crafted almost exclusively by worshipers of Lolth for their spider servants. However, occasionally a fang scarab fell into the hands of overly curious rogues or bards.
The fang scarab granted its wearer access to the insidious whispers of Lolth, which would help to guide it in the midst of battle. However, as this item was primarily designed for spiders, it would only function for non-spiders if they could somehow unlock its secrets and fuse the scarab to their neck.
Though the whispers of Lolth could still aid non-spiders, the process of fusing the scarab to their neck exacted a horrific price as they were transformed into a deformed spider-like creature. Those non-spiders who took up the path of a fang of lolth could gain even greater powers through the whispers of Lolth, though only by further changes to their body.
During the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, the whispers that emanated from fang scarabs ceased. The quietening of Lolths whispers rendered many of the powers of the fang scarabs and the fangs of Lolth inert.
