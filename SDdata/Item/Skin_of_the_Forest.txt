The Skin of the Forest was a unique set of bark-like light armor that was created by some mysterious means in Neverwinter Wood of northwest Faer√ªn sometime before the late 14 century DR.
The Skin of the Forest possessed magical defenses on par with a set of enchanted +1 Leather armor. Its bark-like material allowed the wearer to blend in with the environment with ease and made their steps more silent. Lastly, the wearer of the Skin of the Forest could cast the camouflage spell on themselves once per day. This set of armor could only be worn by druids and rangers.
The Skin of the Forests first known owner was the druid named Henna. Much of her life was unknown, apart from the story behind how she acquired this item. Sometime before the , Henna became lost in the depths of the Neverwinter Wood, pursued by a gang of hungry trolls. As the rain began its downpour, Henna found shelter by an old oak tree. Eventually, her pursuers got close. By some strange magic, Henna began feeling a strange warmth that gently enveloped her. The trolls lumbered past the druid, none the wiser. When she emerged from the shelter, she found herself wearing bark-like armor.
Eventually, by 1372 DR, the miraculous armor left Hennas possession. Sometime later, the armor found its way into the hands of Jacoby, a smith and merchant who ran his workshop out of the Crossroad Keep after the Shadow War of Neverwinter ended devastating the region.
