'''Mage Protectors''' were [[tower shield]]s with [[enchantment]]s of the highest order. They were created by the [[Artificer (Imaskari)|Imaskari]] for their elite warriors to better protect their assigned artificers and magewrights.

==Powers==
Mage Protectors carried a protective enchantment of the highest grade, and granted awesome resistance against magic that affected the mind. They also boosted the wielder's strength, nearly doubling it; unfortunately, this came with a great loss of intelligence.
