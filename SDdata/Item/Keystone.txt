The '''''Keystone''''' was an [[Imaskari]] enchanted device that granted access to the pathways within the [[Celestial Nadir]], and mastery of its contents, and portal or transport magics.

==Description==
In the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, by [[Mirtul 19]], the ''Keystone'' was a polished, [[amber]]-like stone with a natural-looking hole through it.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|90}} Though it was clear enough to see through, by [[Tarsakh 17]] of the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, the ''Keystone'' more closely resembled [[amethyst]], maybe because of a hazy darkness that had been growing inside it, making the crystal no longer clear enough to see through.While it may have been a simple change of color, the crystal that Ususi found for sale in Two Stars is stated to be both purple like an amethyst and resembling her ''Keystone''. Thus, this article assumes that its precise hue resembles that of blue-black amber, which could be mistaken for amethyst. Or, again, it may have indeed been a change of color.

==Powers==
Before 1373 DR, the [[druid]] [[Briartan]] used the ''Keystone'' to control the portals in the ''[[Mucklestones]]'' standing stone circle; the [[Talontar blightlord]] [[Gameliel]] took the stone from him in order to use the same power.{{cite book/Darkvision|54-55|6}} Even after using it for a short time, Ususi became sensitive to the paths piercing the Nadir. The [[Nentyar hunter]] [[Fallon]] employed the ''Keystone'' in order to allow the external influence of the Talontar blightlord [[Anammelech]] into the Nadir.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|138|14}} After recovering the Keystone from Anammelech, Ususi also used the hole in the keystone to peer for leftover seams due to teleportation spells, and employed its power over extradimensional spaces and transport to follow [[Damanda]]'s teleportation with one of her own, despite not knowing the end location.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|263|28}} Finally, she was able to use it to initiate a teleportation of her own, taking her a short distance away.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|293, 296|30}}

In 1374 DR, Ususi carried the Keystone with her while exploring several [[Imaskari]] ruins across the [[Unapproachable East]] along the way to [[Vaelan]], looking for new entrances into the Celestial Nadir.{{cite book/Darkvision|218|23}} as it believed the artifact had the power to fully open Pandorym's prison within the [[Imperial Weapons Cache]].{{cite book/Darkvision|291|30}} Ususi herself also discovered that the ''Keystone'' could be used to "burn out" the influence of the Elder Evil from those it had claimed, effectively destroying them, amongst other abilities it granted with its mastery of the Celestial Nadir.{{cite book/Darkvision|241-243|26}} While inside the Celestial Nadir, it could also be used to officiate burials{{cite book/Darkvision|249|26}} and scrape away stone (presumably through supernatural means).{{cite book/Darkvision|253|26}}

It also could be used to give off light, like a lamp.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|102|11}}

==History==
Numerous ''Keystones'' had been created in the times of [[Imaskar]], though all were thought to be lost by 1374 DR.{{cite book/Darkvision|10-13|2}} In fact, one ''Keystone'' was in the care of Briartan, a druid in charge of the Mucklestones by decree of the [[Circle of Leth]], until it was wrested from him by the Talontar blightlord Gameliel in 1373 DR, who was planning on using the Keystone to extend the reach of the [[Rotting Man]]'s forces.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|73|8}} Before he had the opportunity, however, he was [[disintegrate]]d by the [[Deep Imaskari]] [[wizard]] Ususi Manaallin, who seized the ''Keystone''.

Ususi employed the ''Keystone'' to open a path into the Celestial Nadir, through which she reached [[Yeshelmaar]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|130|13}} A different servant of the Rotting Man, Fallon, tricked her into giving him the ''Keystone'',{{cite book/Lady of Poison|133|14}} which he carried to [[Anammelech]];{{cite book/Lady of Poison|155|16}} Ususi had the stone once more in her keeping after the [[cleric]] [[Marrec]] slew the blightlord.Though she is never shown reclaiming the ''Keystone'' in ''[[Lady of Poison]]'', she is shown to possess it after Anammelech's death. As she is unconscious while Marrec slays Anammelech, he must've taken the stone for her, though the act was not shown.

Later that year, Ususi discovered a fragment of [[plangent crystal|Celestial Nadir crystal]] in a store within [[Two Stars]]. Throughout the rest of 1373, and until Tarsakh of 1374, Ususi carried the ''Keystone'' while searching throughout the Unapproachable East for entrances to the Celestial Nadir located in Imaskari ruins along the way to Vaelan, which she decided to leave for last. The Elder Evil Pandorym sent forces after her, most likely because it required the ''Keystone''.
