        "mainbody": "The '''''white copper ring of fire''''' was a unique magical ring that was forged by the [[djinn]] to aid them against the [[efreet]].",
        "Description": "This ring was made from white [[copper]].",
        "Powers": "If worn by any spellcaster, this ring augmented any [[Flame (province)|flame]] spell cast so that it caused intense white flames to strike any evil creatures or those who drew magic from the [[Negative Energy plane]]. The ring accomplished this by drawing its power from the [[Positive Energy plane]] and the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. Additionally, [[fire]]-based spells cast by the wearer fully harmed any creature that was normally immune to such attacks."
