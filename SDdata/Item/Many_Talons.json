        "Powers": "Each of the ''Many Talons'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and magically sapped life energy from their targets, transferring it to the wielder. This ''vampiric regeneration'' was accompanied by magic that made ''Many Talons'' deadly to creatures venerating powers of good.",
        "History": "''Many Talons'' were born in the eastern land of Kara-Tur 200 years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. An unknowable evil only known as The Calling targeted the [[Azaki]] assassins' guild of Kara-Tur and corrupted a minor attendant of the organization. In exchange for service to the Calling, the corrupted attendant's family was elevated to power. Now possessed, the attendant sowed chaos across the land. The corrupted body generated seemingly endless ''Many Talons'' out of their body before being slain by a [[sohei]] whose name was lost to history.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Many Talons'' showed up in various locations across [[Faer√ªn]], including the city of [[Neverwinter]] and in stock of [[Okuzo's Imports]] store in [[Westgate]]."
