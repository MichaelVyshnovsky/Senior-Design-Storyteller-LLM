An iron flask was a powerful magic item that was capable of trapping and binding a creature that was not native to the plane on which it was located.
An iron flask was shaped like an iron bottle with a brass stopper.
By speaking the command word of the iron flask, the user could trap a nearby extraplanar creature inside it for an indeterminate amount of time. It was possible for the creature to resist being trapped, and creatures that had been trapped before were harder to imprison again.
Upon removing the brass stopper, the imprisoned creature was released and bound to obey the owner of the flask for one hour, after which it would be free to act as it pleased.
* Amelior Amanitas owned a gold and copper variant of the iron flask, which held a djinn and two ogres respectively. At one point he provided a group of adventurers he had hired two brass variants of the iron flask. These required a user to speak a command word to imprison a creature, which was, "into the flask you go..."
