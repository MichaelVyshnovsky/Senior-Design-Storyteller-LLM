'''''Elquillar''''' was a ''+1 [[sword]]'' whose [[magic]]al enchantments all revolved around the transformation of appearance. The appearance of the sword, its wielder, and the targets it struck, could all be altered through its various powers.{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}

==Description==
Regardless of the form of the blade, ''Elquillar's'' name was spelled out along the blade in [[rune]]s of unknown origin.

==Powers==
One major effect that ''Elquillar'' possessed was its ability to undo transformation [[spell]]s, effects, or other abilities upon striking a target, regardless of their origin. Whether it was a renowned [[archmage]] transformed into a [[squirrel]] or a [[doppelganger]] mimicking the appearance of another [[humanoid]], they would revert to their true shape when struck by this weapon.

Furthermore, the wielder of ''Elquillar'' could change the form and shape of the sword, into that of a [[dagger]], [[short sword]], [[scimitar]], or other such bladed weapon and could change their own appearance as if they were wearing a ''[[hat of disguise]]''. When they actually held the blade in hand, this individual was protected from [[magic]] [[spell]]s and effects as if they were wearing a ''[[ring of mind shielding]]''.

==History==
This unique sword had quite old, albeit unknown, origins. It was forged some time before the 8{{th}} century [[DR]] either by [[elves]], in an effort to spy on other races, or, more likely, a particular [[illusionist]] from [[Calimshan]] known as [[Akhir Ahad]]. According to legend, although he long-evaded [[assassin]]s sent by his political foes, he was eventually caught by [[night rogue]]s, though not before passing the blade to his most trusted bodyguard. This nameless man bore the blade for some time before it became lost for a few centuries.

Around 300 years later, ''Elquillar'' showed up in an auction within the city of [[Waterdeep]], passed hands a number of times, which tied in with a handful of murders, and wound up in the possession of an assassin known as [[Rider in White|The Rider in White]], who primarily killed [[evil]]-aligned targets within the region around the [[Inner Sea]].
