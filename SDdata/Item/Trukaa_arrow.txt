A '''trukaa''' was a type of [[arrow]] used by [[Angulutiun]] and [[Iulutiun]] hunters

==Description==
A trukaa was a bone arrow with a blunt tip, specifically designed for the purpose of dispatching small game without causing harm to their fur.

==Availability==
Though relatively rare outside of the [[Great Glacier]], twelve trukaa arrows could be purchased for 3 [[sp]].
