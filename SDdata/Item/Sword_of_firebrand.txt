'''''Sword of firebrand''''' was an enchanted [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[longsword]] created by the residents of [[Dwarven Dungeons]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Sword of firebrand'' had a bright orange-red blade.

==Powers==
The longsword possessed a ''+3'' enchantment and was able to produce a spray of flames similar to the ''[[burning hands]]'' spell.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], a ''sword of firebrand'' could be found inside one of the ancient chambers inside the [[Halls of Stone]] of Dwarven Dungeons. The sword was stored in a chest beside an enchanted column that created concentric waves of fire with regular intervals that managed to scare away any of the many creatures scavenging through the ruins.
