Sword of firebrand was an enchanted dwarven longsword created by the residents of Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor.
Sword of firebrand had a bright orange-red blade.
The longsword possessed a +3 enchantment and was able to produce a spray of flames similar to the burning hands spell.
In 1369 DR, a sword of firebrand could be found inside one of the ancient chambers inside the Halls of Stone of Dwarven Dungeons. The sword was stored in a chest beside an enchanted column that created concentric waves of fire with regular intervals that managed to scare away any of the many creatures scavenging through the ruins.
