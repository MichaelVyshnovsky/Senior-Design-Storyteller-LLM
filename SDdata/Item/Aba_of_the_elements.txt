An '''''aba of the elements''''' was a magic robe found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}

==Description==
The coloration of an ''aba of the elements'' depended on the element it represented with [[fire|flame]] being red, [[air|wind]] being blue, [[earth (element)|sand]] being white, and [[water|sea]] being green.

==Powers==
An ''aba of the elements'' had similar in powers to ''[[robe of the archmagi|robes of the archmagi]]'', save that they were classified by the element they represented. An [[elemental mage]] who donned an ''aba of the elements'' for any element outside of his speciality suffered excruciating pain and a permanent loss of some of their skills. A [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerer]] could safely wear one of these robes for either of their two chosen elements.

An ''aba of the elements'' granted the wearer magic resistance and made them more difficult to strike during combat. It amplified elemental spells cast by the wearer so that the target of these spells was less likely to resist their effects.
