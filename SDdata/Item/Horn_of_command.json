        "mainbody": "A horn of command was an enchanted musical instrument that amplified the users voice.\nThe magic of a horn of command allowed the user to be heard at distances three times greater than normal. However, once per day the horn could be used to issue a suggestion to anyone within  provided they spoke the same language as the wielder. The horn could also be targeted to a single individual. Doing this made it much harder for the target to resist the horns magic."
