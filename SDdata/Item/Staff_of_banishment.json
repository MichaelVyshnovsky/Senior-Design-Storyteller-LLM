        "mainbody": "Staves of banishment, also known as wands of banishment, were a type of magical short staff created to rid the Prime Material plane of powerful other-worldly creatures.\nThese light staves were usually crafted from shadow-wood.\nThe staves possessed a limited number of charges of the spells banishment, dismissal, repulsion and slow, which could be cast by the wielder upon utterance of a command word.\nThis type of staff was conceived by the young mage Savengriff, apprentice of Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun. He crafted just over a dozen of these powerful staves and distributed them among his friends and colleagues in the North, including Khelben. He later lost one of these while exploring the Dungeon of the Crypt with the Company of Crazed Venturers.\nWhen Elminster Aumar examined one of these staves, he discovered its command word was \"Baerlaguth\"."
