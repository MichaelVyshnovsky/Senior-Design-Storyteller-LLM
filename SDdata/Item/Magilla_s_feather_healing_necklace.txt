Magillas feather healing necklace was an enchanted feather jewelry that contained healing magics crafted by Magilla, an aged saru shaman of the Malatran Plateau in the late 14 century DR.
This magic necklace was assembled on a leather cord that had five large blue parrot feathers affixed to it.
Each of the necklaces feathers was enchanted to dispense healing magic when removed from the necklace and touched a creature.
In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, the saru village, Magillas home, fell under a wasting curse placed on it by a vain earth spirit of the Living Jungle named Ligela. The spirit was quelled by a group of adventuring tribesfolk, saving the lives of suffering saru. Magilla enchanted several items as a gift for the saviors. Magillas feather healing necklace was among the magic items created by the shaman for the heroes.
