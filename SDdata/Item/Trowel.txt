A '''trowel''' was a hand tool used for digging and construction.

|Master masons can perform miracles with this simple tool, just as master painters do with a simple [[paintbrush|brush]].

==Description==
Trowels had broad, flat heads that let them carry materials such as construction [[mortar]] or earth.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold trowels for masonry and bricklaying work. They came in {{SIAdj|5|inch|c|long=yes}} (2 [[gp]]), {{SIAdj|7|inch|c|long=yes}} (4 gp), and {{SIAdj|10|inch|c|long=yes}} (5 gp) sizes, with a flat edge and a grooved edge. It was also possible to have these trowels with a personalized sigil added, but this required positive identification of the stonemason to prevent fraud.

==Usage==
Trowels were used by masons to spread mortar for construction work, alongside other basic tools such as [[hammer]]s, [[chisel]]s, [[square]]s, and [[brush]]es. The flat, wide head of a trowel also made it suitable for handling and spreading other semi-liquid materials besides mortar.

Trowls could also be used for gardening and other types of delicate digging, such as archaeology.

==Notable Trowels==
A rusty [[iron]] trowl was kept on display in the [[Lost Level]] of [[Undermountain]], a relic that [[Melair I]] himself supposedly used to spread mortar.
