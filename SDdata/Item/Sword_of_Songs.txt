The Sword of Songs was the favored weapon of Finder Wyvernspur, the god of change.
It was made of silver and sang incessantly whenever drawn.
It was a magical bastard sword with the powers of both a sword of dancing +4 to +7 and a singing sword.
As a singing sword, it conferred immunity to various spells that affected the mind and morale. The sword could sing any song known to Finder, in his own voice, whenever he will, even in battle. These tunes could hamper a foes morale, freeze shriekers, null the powers of harpies, and entrance beings with minds, making them open to suggestion.
