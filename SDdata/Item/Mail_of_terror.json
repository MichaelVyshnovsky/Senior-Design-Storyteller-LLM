        "mainbody": "The mail of terror was a unique and terrifying piece of enchanted iron armor that carried a variety of fear-inducing magics.\nThe mail of terror possessed a simple +1 enchantment, but its power and value did not lay in defensive magics alone. The armor increased the wearers strength and improved their intimidation skills. Finally, the mail of terror held twenty charges of several powerful fear-based spells. Aptly so, the spell of fear could be discharged at the coast one a single charge, as well as the spell of the phantasmal killer, while the wail of the banshee spell consumed four charges.\nThe mail of terror was a truly terrifying work of metalsmithing and magic. No one knew why, how, or who created this chainmail. Even when it was not worn by an individual, the armor was a petrifying sight to behold. When the mail of terror was first discovered, it was simply abandoned, unguarded, presumably because its owners left it and fled in horror. Because of that, sages assumed that the creator of the mail did a bit too good of a job crafting the mail of terror. When the creator finished their magnum opus of smithing and enchanting, they took one look at the mail and could not help but run from its overwhelming aura of terror.\nIn the , mail of terror made its way to the city of Westgate when it was sold among countless unique and rare arms and armor on the citys Market Triangle."
