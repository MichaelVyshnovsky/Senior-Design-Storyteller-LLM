'''''The Sceptre of Leogans''''' was a powerful magic [[wand]] used by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to capture and brainwash the [[drow]] of the [[House Kilsek]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
The ''Sceptre of Leogans'' was a decorated bat-winged rod.

==Powers==
The ''Sceptre of Leogans'' allowed the user to cast the ''[[mass suggestion]]'' spell and granted them increased charisma and will in exchange for reduced wisdom and fortitude.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], one of the overseers of the Cult of the Dragons was using the ''Sceptre of Leogans'' in the deeper levels of the [[Elven Catacombs]] to capture and enthrall drow of House Kilsek. The cult used the drow bodies to feed their dragon allies and the [[dracolich]] [[Pelendralaar]] himself, while the souls were extracted and stored in a large soul vessel in [[Castle Cormanthor]]'s Silverspear Armory.
