        "mainbody": "Kammarth was a magical drug concocted from a rare forest root and a subterranean fungus.\nIt was taken as a powder or as a beige jelly and was either eaten or taken through skin contact the former was a more effective way to experience its effects. While it was a magical drug, the producer didnt need to be able to cast magic.\nA potent stimulant, kammarth made one feel good and energetic but it also had real effects. First, the magical effect of the drug bestowed the effects of the spell expeditious retreat, one of the few ways for non-spellcasters to obtain it. The duration of this magical effect was a few minutes. About a minute after the initial effect kicked in, kammarth heightened the base agility and reflexes of its user until the spell effect ended.\nOverdosing with kammarth was easy. When a person took two doses in an 8-hour period, they suffered physical damage and was paralyzed for several minutes. When one made the mistake of taking more than three doses in 24 hours, the drug caused serious damage to the body and paralyzed the person for several hours.\nIt was moderately addictive.\nThe drug was known to the drow and was distributed among the military, for example among those of House Jaelre. Valas Jaelre, second cousin to Jezz the Lame, was a known producer of kammarth and ziran. Doses were given to leaders at the House Jaelre outpost in Cormanthor, for distribution to the troops."
