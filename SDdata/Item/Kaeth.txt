'''Kaeth''' (or '''kaethae'''{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Kaeth}}

==Production==
Kaeth was primarily produced in [[Maztica]], the [[Anauroch]] desert, areas to the south and east of [[Durpar]],{{Cite polyhedron/129/Agriculture, Invention, and Society in Malatra|30}} Around [[1367 DR]], it was claimed that coffee grew only in the [[Shining Lands]] of [[Durpar]], [[Estagund]], and [[Var the Golden]], and coffee was the Shining Lands' most profitable export.<ref group="note">[[The Shining South (1993)|''The Shining South'' (1993)]] contradicts itself several times on whether coffee comes from Durpar or Ulgarth. Since the sourcebook is introduced by a Halruaan, and all Ulgarth's produce comes through Durpar, the discrepancy is easily explained as an in-universe error, but not easily resolved. The flat, sunny plains of the Shining Lands were also suitable for growing coffee and other crops.<ref> 

Kaeth beans were harvested from short trees in mountainous areas, then sun-dried on rocks. Finally, the beans would be stuffed into cloth sacks, then the sacks would be stacked inside wooden crates for ease of transport.

Finally, when it was to be drunk, it was brewed into a black-hued beverage.

==Effects==
Coffee had a reputation for refreshing the imbiber's mind.

==Variants==
Kaeth beans originating in Maztica were typically red-brown and had a powdery quality. These were shipped across the sea, to [[Baldur's Gate]], and typically distributed from there to [[Tashalar]] and Calimshan. Kaeth brewed in Westgate was typically of a strong variety and was made from ground red beans. Westgate kaeth was popular outside of the [[Dragon Coast]] and could be found bottled and sold on the Sword Coast, as far north as the city of [[Luskan]].

Anauran beans were smaller, harder, and so dark brown that they looked almost black. The nomadic [[Bedine]] people who cultivated the beans referred to kaeth as '''qahwa''' or simply '''qaw'''. After the return of [[Thultanthar]], the Bedine consumed most of the supply themselves. As a result, the Anauran beans were extremely uncommon outside of their native region.

The kaeth beans from beyond Durpar were larger, had a pronounced cleft or depressed line running their length, and were brown with a bluish hue. This variant was often referred to as '''Thondur's''', named after the trader [[Thondur]], who for a while had a monopoly on the kaeth trade reaching Calimshan, Tashalar, and the [[Vilhon Reach]]. This bean type was the most common in lands to the south. In the 15{{th}} century DR, Thondur's became cheaper thanks to the shattering of Thondur's monopoly.

On the plane of [[Bytopia]], popular kaeth variants included "Krigala Supreme" from the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]], "Mountain Majesty" from [[Mount Celestia]], as well as "Devotion" and "Purity" from [[Elysium]].

[[Amn]] was known to brew strong and bitter spiced kaeth that was described as being as dark as tar.

In the [[Domains of Dread]], the [[Vistani]] were known to brew coffee that was described as being particularly bitter and thick.<ref>

==History==
Previously enjoyed only in [[southeast Faerûn]], [[Durpari]] traders began large-scale export of Durpar-grown coffee around [[1367 DR]]. Drinking coffee was just becoming popular in wider [[Faerûn]] at the time. It was drunk in [[Cormyr]] by [[Eleint]] of 1367 DR, even at the [[Bold Bard]] tavern in [[Ghars]], but it was too costly for common folk. Coffee was regularly exported from the Shining Lands by [[1373 DR]].<ref>

In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the kaeth trade was considered more popular and profitable than the [[tea]] trade.

==Regional Customs==

Brewed kaeth was the most popular form in Calimshan, the Tashalar, the [[Heartlands]], and the [[North]]. In some places, kaeth was mixed with medicines or [[mint]] leaves sprinkled over the surface, prepared by stewing the beans in a pot over a fire or a hearth.<ref group="note">According to ''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]'', page 94, black coffee in the Realms is stronger than its real-world counterpart because of the preparation method. Some people also liked to chew beans while traveling or eat them roasted.

In Calimshan and Tashalar, kaeth was mostly consumed pure, although sometimes with the addition of powdered roots, nuts, or ginger. In [[Sembia]] and [[Chessenta]], the preferred method of consumption involved mixing kaeth with [[chocolate]] or alcohol.

In areas to the north, kaeth was mostly served in [[mug|cider mugs]]. In southern lands, it was more commonly served in small, flared bowls known as "kavvar".

Bad coffee was described using a handy repertory of oaths in northern lands, while in the South it was called '''ortulag''' ({{Pronounce|OR|tu|lag|}}), a word derived from a defunct dialect meaning "warmed-over chamber pot rinse."

In some settlements, there were specialist shops known as kaeth houses, such as the [[House of the Lute]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-09 - House of the Lute}} and over thirty known establishments in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

[[Maniacal Manny's Sensational Emporium of Sales]] in [[Procampur]] carried some specialty coffee blends from all around Faerûn, including [[Thayvian Cappuccino Mist]], [[Sembian Dark Roast]], and [[Waterdhavian Purple Late]].

==Other Usages==
Coffee beans were a [[material component]] used to cast the ''[[chaotic sleep]]'' [[spell]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Spell of Bad Weather|20}}{{Cite organized play/LC/In the Halls of the Mountain Mage|26}}
