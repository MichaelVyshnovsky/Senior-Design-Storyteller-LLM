        "History": "The first pair of ''boots of hardiness'' was commissioned by a druid named [[Aawill]] who travelled all over the north of [[Faer√ªn]]. He needed a reliable pair of boots that improved his chanced of survival while heading to the dangers of Neverwinter Woods. Eventually, he became the arch druid of the woods' druid grove and ordered more pairs of the enchanted boots to be created for his fellow circle members."
