Hunters bracelets were enchanted items from Chult the late 15 century DR.
Hunters bracelets were wide leather armlets with a buckle and metal studs. One side of the bracelet was decorated with light fur.
These enchanted items belonged to Chultan hunters and brought them luck in pursuit of their prey. Wearers of these hunters bracelets had an easier time landing successful hits and placing arrows into their opponents.
