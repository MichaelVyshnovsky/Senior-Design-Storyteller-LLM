        "Powers": "''Darts of pinning'' were enhanced with a ''+2'' enchantment and held magics that paralyzed the darts' targets. Once a ''dart of pinning'' reached its target it struck them motionless as if affected by the [[carrion crawler brain juice]] or ''[[hold monster]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''darts of pinning'' could be found in [[Thar]] and the [[Moonsea]] region and wielded by agents of the [[Zhentarim]]."
