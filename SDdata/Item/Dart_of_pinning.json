        "mainbody": "Darts of pinning were large needle-shaped enchanted darts designed to restrain rather than kill.\nDarts of pinning were enhanced with a +2 enchantment and held magics that paralyzed the darts targets. Once a dart of pinning reached its target it struck them motionless as if affected by the carrion crawler brain juice or hold monster spell.\nIn the late 14 century DR, darts of pinning could be found in Thar and the Moonsea region and wielded by agents of the Zhentarim."
