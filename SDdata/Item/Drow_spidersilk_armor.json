        "mainbody": "Drow spidersilk armor was a magical spider-silk woven chainmail that belonged to Dreydre Freth, who was one of the two leaders of the House Freth operations under Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.\nDrow spidersilk armor was a lightweight chainmail that was made out of a type of gray fabric that could pass for a simple item of clothing. Upon closer examination, the fibers of the armor were woven using the silk of the spiders of Underdark.\nThis finely-woven chainmail possessed uncannily resistance to damage, dramatically increasing the wearers defense. Additionally, a set of drow spidersilk armor increased the wearers dexterity and reflexes. These sets of armor also granted the wearer the spell-like ability to cast web. Like other sets of chainmail armor, these sets given a small chance of the arcane spell failure, even though significantly lower than chainmail made of other materials, making it easily wearable by arcane spellcasters.\nThe drow of House Freth found a way into deep catacombs under Castle Cormanthor in 1369 DR. They used it as an opportunity to outfit an operation to loot ancient elven burial sites for powerful magic, transporting the booty back to Underbark. The operation was led by Greyanna and Dreydre Freth. Eventually a group of heroes sent by Elminster to stop the activities of Cult of the Dragon in the ruined elven city were able to defeat both Freth leaders. Upon Dreydres death, they recovered three powerful enchanted items of drow making Venom, medallion of Lolth, and a set of drow spidersilk armor."
