'''''Mourner's armor''''' was a form of magical [[lamellar]] armor that originated in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, and was created by a [[great ghul]] [[sha'ir]].

==Description==
The black plates of this armor were often decorated with bright colors.

==Powers==
When worn, ''mourner's armor'' offered complete protection from all normal ranged weapons. It also made it much more difficult for the wearer's opponents to strike them.

The remaining powers of the armor were considered a curse by most, or at least a mixed blessing. Once the wearer suffered substantial physical harm during battle, they no longer felt pain of any kind. When even more damage was suffered the wearer was filled with a sense of invincibility, continuing to fight well beyond the point of death after suffering additional wounds that would fell a normal man. If "fatal" wounds were sustained during battle, the wearer would die several days later as the armor consumed their life force.

All magical forms of healing used on the wearer had no effect. Non-fatal wounds could only be healed by natural means.

Once donned, and once the curse was activated during battle, ''mourner's armor'' could only be removed by the original great ghul who created it or by a ''[[wish]]''. 

==History==
Throughout the history of the Land of Fate, several brave warriors were believed to have willingly donned a set of ''mourner's armor'', knowing full well the consequences of their actions, in order to turn the tide of battle and help their cause.
