'''Athkatlan clarry''' was a type of blended [[wine]] produced in [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]].

==Description==
Athkatlan clarry was mixed using ruby-red sour wines, [[honey]], and various [[spice]]s, including a heavy addition of [[vanilla]] that aggressively dominated the drink's flavor. Apart from vanilla, Athkatlan rich red clarry tasted sweet and [[herb]]y.

==History==
Historically, Athkatla imported red [[Calishite]] sour wines of dubious quality. These wines did not satisfy the Athkatlan pallet, so some of the rich families of the city began making their own blended wines. Eventually, a specific blend with heavy vanilla flavoring became overwhelmingly popular and became widespread enough to be exported out of Amn.
