Athkatlan clarry was a type of blended wine produced in Athkatla, the capital of Amn.
Athkatlan clarry was mixed using ruby-red sour wines, honey, and various spices, including a heavy addition of vanilla that aggressively dominated the drinks flavor. Apart from vanilla, Athkatlan rich red clarry tasted sweet and herby.
Historically, Athkatla imported red Calishite sour wines of dubious quality. These wines did not satisfy the Athkatlan pallet, so some of the rich families of the city began making their own blended wines. Eventually, a specific blend with heavy vanilla flavoring became overwhelmingly popular and became widespread enough to be exported out of Amn.
