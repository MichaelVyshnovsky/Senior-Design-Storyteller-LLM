Alestone, also known as clinozoisite, was a semi-precious stone found in Faer√ªn.
This gem was named for its brown to yellowish brown color that resembled a well-aged ale. It was mined in crystal form and usually facet cut into fashionable gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.
Alestone had the ability to deflect missiles away from itself. A being wearing one or more alestones was slightly less likely to be hit by projectiles (any number of alestone gems greater than zero was equally effective). Conversely, it was somewhat difficult to catch a thrown alestone or quickly grab a stationary one. Some adventurers called alestone a "scatterer".
