Melairkyn baldrics were a variety of enchanted baldrics developed by the dwarves of Clan Melairkyn.
These baldrics were made of mithril in a chain mail style and had Clan Melairkyns symbol as a seal.
These baldrics granted their wearers a +2 protective enchantment, as well as the ability to understand both Dwarvish and its written form.
