        "mainbody": "'''Thannaberry''' was a cordial&mdash;an alcoholic beverage made with fruit or berry juice&mdash;available in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}",
        "Description": "This cordial used the juice from a blue berry that was similar in texture to a cherry. Then a wine with a fiery bite was added, along with a secret blend of [[herb]]s. It was sold at [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]] located near Handrornlar (the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar) on [[North Way]]. The staff at Munsrum's testified that this cordial had beneficial medicinal uses, which justified the price of 6 [[gold piece]]s per bottle. Thannaberry tasted sweet and was dark blue in color."
