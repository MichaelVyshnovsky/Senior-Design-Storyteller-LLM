        "mainbody": "hannaberry was a cordial&mdashan alcoholic beverage made with fruit or berry juice&mdashavailable in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis cordial used the juice from a blue berry that was similar in texture to a cherry. Then a wine with a fiery bite was added, along with a secret blend of herbs. It was sold at Munsrums Ready Ladle located near Handrornlar (the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar) on North Way. The staff at Munsrums testified that this cordial had beneficial medicinal uses, which justified the price of 6 gold pieces per bottle. Thannaberry tasted sweet and was dark blue in color."
