The Guide was a heavy crossbow of accuracy from northwest Faer√ªn.
The Guide was a masterfully crafted weapon with a +2 enchantment, but the guide effectively had a +7 enchantment that made it exceedingly easy to hit targets with it.
The Guide belonged to King Shastir Longeye and was his favorite siege weapon. Under the Kings command, the forces were armed with similarly enchanted crossbows that allowed them to eliminate castles defenders from behind their battlements with ease. By 1281 DR, very few of these crossbows were still in existence after King Shastir Longeyes death and his forces destroyed by an assembled army from the lands that fell to his conquests.
One of the Guides eventually found a way into the ruined interior of the citadel of the Severed Hand to the south-west of the Spine of the World.
