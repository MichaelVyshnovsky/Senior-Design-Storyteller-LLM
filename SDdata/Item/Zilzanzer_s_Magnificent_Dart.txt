'''''Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts''''' were [[enchanted]] [[dart]]s created by the [[wizard]] [[Zilzanzer]] sometime before the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Unlike most Zilzanzer's creations, the ''Magnificent Darts'' worked exactly as expected. Each tiny missile possessed a ''+1'' enchantment that helped them reach the target. But the enchantment that made them truly useful was the magic that allowed the wielder to throw five ''Magnificent Darts'' in six seconds and allowed anyone to use them, regardless of their profession or specialization.

==History==
These magic darts were created by the maker of the ''[[ring of the gorgon]]''- mage Zilzanzer, who was prone to creation of items that did not function as expected. ''Zilzanzer's Magnificent Darts'' worked out just right and he sold a large number of the darts to his colleagues. Overall, Zilzanzer created a great number of these darts before his death some years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. In the late 13{{th}} century DR, a handful of these darts could be found in the magical item collection of [[Kieran Nye]], a deserter mage from the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]].
