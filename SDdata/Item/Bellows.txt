'''Bellows''' were items in the Realms often used by [[wizard]]s and craftsmen to increase the airflow to a furnace and produce more heat.
{{Quote
|Better bellows mean hotter fires; hotter fires mean purer metals; purer metals mean greater strength; stronger weapons or armor may save a warrior's life.

==Description==
Bellows were typically made from wood and [[calfskin]] with a [[brass]] nozzle.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold bellows for around 5–10 [[gold piece]]s depending upon their size.
* [[Ember Me More]], a specialty shop in [[Ravens Bluff]], sold bellows.

==Usages==
Besides their use in forges, sizeable bellows were used in [[pipe organ]]s to push air through pipes, thereby producing sound.<ref> And there existed a bellows-powered variant of [[shawm]]s developed by [[Faerûn]]ian [[gnome]]s.

==Notable Users==
* Bellows were favored by wizards and craftsmen.
