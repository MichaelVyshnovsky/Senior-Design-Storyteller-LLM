        "mainbody": "A '''centrifuge''' was a device used to separate the components of a liquid. They were a vital piece of laboratory equipment.",
        "Description": "Operating on a similar principle to mill wheels, the centrifuges sold through Aurora's had a weighted horizontal wheel that was rotated by working foot-pedals. When [[vial]]s of liquid (securely stoppered to prevent the contents spraying out) placed in the wheel were spun at sufficient speed, heavier solid materials moved to the base on the vial. This aided extraction of precipitants. The process could take several minutes of pedaling. Usually one centrifuge was required for a complete laboratory setup.",
        "Availability": "They were sold through [[Aurora's Emporium]] and the [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[Lindavar]] used a centrifuge, together with reagents and an [[alembic]], to examine a vial of pale yellow fluid found in the possession of Mayor [[Tobald]] of [[Ghars]], discovering the [[poison]] [[blackweed]]."
