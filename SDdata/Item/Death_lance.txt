'''''Death lances''''' were a rare melee weapon used by the [[drow]].

==Description==
A ''death lance'' was a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}-long lance made from a unique, mottled, sparkling-and-dull gray metal.

==Creation==
The method of their creation was a closely guarded secret among the drow, requiring the expertise of skilled and powerful [[wizard]]s. 

==Powers==
''Death lances'' released a powerful negative force upon impact. In addition to physical damage, they also inflicted chilling damage. When they were created, each lance was given a charge. When this charge was expended, dark, writhing tendrils of black light crawled down the lance towards the targeted creature. The struck victim then suffered the effects of an ''[[energy drain]]''. The lance could not be recharged.

==Usage==
They were utilized by drow city-gate and temple guards to combat formidable enemies.

A ''death lance'' may be wielded by anyone. However, its use was not considered a good act and may have severe consequences for [[paladin]]s, [[priest]]s, and certain other individuals.

==Notable Owners==
[[Berg'inyon Baenre]] armed himself with a ''death lance''.
