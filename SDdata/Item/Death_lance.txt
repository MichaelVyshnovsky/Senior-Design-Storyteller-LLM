Death lances were a rare melee weapon used by the drow.
A death lance was a -long lance made from a unique, mottled, sparkling-and-dull gray metal.
The method of their creation was a closely guarded secret among the drow, requiring the expertise of skilled and powerful wizards. 
Death lances released a powerful negative force upon impact. In addition to physical damage, they also inflicted chilling damage. When they were created, each lance was given a charge. When this charge was expended, dark, writhing tendrils of black light crawled down the lance towards the targeted creature. The struck victim then suffered the effects of an energy drain. The lance could not be recharged.
They were utilized by drow city-gate and temple guards to combat formidable enemies.
A death lance may be wielded by anyone. However, its use was not considered a good act and may have severe consequences for paladins, priests, and certain other individuals.
