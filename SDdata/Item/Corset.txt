Corsets were a very common lingerie form of undergarment in the Realms, worn by either sex (including portly merchants) to constrict their waistline and enhance their appearance.
These garments were typically made of laced-up boiled hide. Some were known to have hidden pockets for carrying coins or a tiny knife.
