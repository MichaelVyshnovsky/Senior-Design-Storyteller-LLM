        "mainbody": "The Turabins Cleansing Trinket was an enchanted ring, named after one of the ancient wizards of Myth Drannor. It was part of the Fading Rings set.\nTurabins ring was a band of crystal that sparkled in light.\nThe Cleansing Trinket granted the wearer increased protection from magic and allowed them to dispel magic at will. The ring possessed nine charges of dispelling.\nIn 1369 DR, Turabins Cleansing Trinket came to be possessed or possibly crafted by a mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head, located in the Nightingale Court in the ruins of Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem statues depicting various gods and individuals, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings, one being the protective band of crystal, Turabins Cleansing Trinket."
