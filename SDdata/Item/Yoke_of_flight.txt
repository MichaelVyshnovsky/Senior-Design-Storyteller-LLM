A '''''yoke of flight''''' was a [[magic]]al yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of [[horse]]s to a [[chariot]] and gain the ability to fly.

==Powers==
Using the yoke, a rider could command the horses and chariot to fly at a maximum speed of twelve miles (nineteen kilometers) per hour.

==Restrictions==
Aerial maneuverability granted by the yoke was rather poor. In order to take off from the ground, the horses had to gallop with sufficient speed in a straight line. Landing likewise required a straight ground path with enough length to slow down safely. Furthermore, a reasonable airspeed had to be maintained, otherwise the chariot would crash.
