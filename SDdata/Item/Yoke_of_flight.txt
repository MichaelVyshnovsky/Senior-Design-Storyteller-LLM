A yoke of flight was a magical yoke that enabled its user to harness a pair of horses to a chariot and gain the ability to fly.
Using the yoke, a rider could command the horses and chariot to fly at a maximum speed of twelve miles (nineteen kilometers) per hour.
Aerial maneuverability granted by the yoke was rather poor. In order to take off from the ground, the horses had to gallop with sufficient speed in a straight line. Landing likewise required a straight ground path with enough length to slow down safely. Furthermore, a reasonable airspeed had to be maintained, otherwise the chariot would crash.
