        "mainbody": "The '''''Crown of Karsus''''' was an ancient and powerful [[artifact]] crafted by the briefly divine [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Karsus]]. It allowed the wearer to wield magical power, yet remain independent from [[the Weave]].\n{{Quote|Mystra wanted the brain obliterated ''because'' of this crown. She fears a world in which such power is beyond her control—ready to be claimed by Karsus' successor.|[[Gale Dekarios]].}}",
        "Description": "In its most modern iteration, the ''Crown of Karsus'' remained massive in scale, similar to [[Karsus Butte]], the once-god's petrified remains found in the [[Dire Wood]].",
        "Powers": "{{Quote|The Crown has laid low all who attempt to harness its power—archwizards, emperors, gods. It would tear you apart.|[[Raphael]].}}\nThe ''Crown of Karsus'' allowed the wearer to, as Karsus put in his own words, \"attract and absorb magical knowledge\" and have \"dominion over oneself\" separate from the Weave. Through use of the three ''Netherstones'', the ''Crown'' can be used to issue commands to the wearer, but all three stones are required to relay the command. Once the wearer has finished executing their current orders, they may be free to do as they please.",
        "History": "{{Quote|...it was what he did with [the crown] that sealed his fate, and for a time, that of magic itself. The Crown was merely the means.|Gale Dekarios, regarding Karsus.}}\nKarsus wore the crown when he attempted to supplant [[Mystryl]] as the new god of magic in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, a desperate act he believed would save [[Netheril]] from the destruction wrought by the conflict between the [[phaerimm]] and the [[sharn]]. While Karsus briefly achieved apotheosis, his actions―which came to be known as [[Karsus's Folly]]―ended the empire of Netheril in mere moments. The ''Crown of Karsus'' granted the arcanist the power to even \"succeed\" to that extent, but was partially destroyed in the process.\n\nSome time after the fall of Netheril, the ''Crown of Karsus'' was recovered by the [[archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]] and kept within his infernal vault in [[Cania]] for over a millennium.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the mortal [[Chosen]] of [[Bane]], [[Enver Gortash]], and of [[Bhaal]], the [[Dark Urge]], orchestrated a daring raid on Mephistopheles' vault in the hells. With the strategic aid of Helsik, a diabolist capable of opening portals to the hells, they successfully stole the crown from the archdevil. They and their allies, fellow chosen of [[Bane]] and of [[Myrkul]], used it to enslave the [[elder brain]] that dwelled beneath [[Moonrise Towers]] and start the [[Cult of the Absolute]] across the [[Sword Coast]]. Gortash and his allies placed the ''Crown of Karsus'' atop the elder brain, and used three jewels―known as ''[[netherstone]]s''―that were sundered from the crown during Karsus's Folly to control the aberrant monstrosity. The three separated ''netherstones'' allowed the chosen of the [[Dead Three]] to control the [[Netherbrain]] and use it to further the schemes of their respective gods.",
        "Reputation": "The Crown was one third of the powerful artifacts that composed the ''[[Regalia of Karsus]]''. Their functions were detailed in ''[[The Annals of Karsus]]''.\n\nIt was believed by some that the original ''Crown of Karsus'' could be reforged by rejoining the setting with the three ''netherstones''.",
