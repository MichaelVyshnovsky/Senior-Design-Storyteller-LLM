        "Powers": "''Burnt Steel'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hands towards the target and increased the weapon's damaging force. Additionally, the blade could damage creatures that otherwise were unaffected by mundane weapons.",
        "History": "According to some tales, Belamy Lightfingers, a [[hin]] adventurer and a member of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]], decided to take on the adventurer's career after finding this sturdy [[sword]] in a hole near his home in [[Red Larch]]. Belamy wielded ''Burnt Steel'' until his death in the late 15{{th}} century DR, while escorting a caravan up the [[Sword Coast]] to the city of [[Luskan]]."
