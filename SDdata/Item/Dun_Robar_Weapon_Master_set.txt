The DunRobar Weapon Master set were a varied collection of enchanted masterwork weapons produced and used by House DunRobar of Sschindylryn.
The weapons were universally exceptional-quality and matte black implements. It included drow-style weapons like bastard swords, daggers, greataxes, khopeshes, light maces, longswords, mauls, quarterstaves, rapiers, scimitars, shortswords, and warhammers, as well as dwarven waraxes made for duergar soldiers.
The DunRobar weapons were made even more deadly with a variety of magical enhancements that improved the strikes and tactics that the wielder could use.
Many of these weapons were destroyed or stolen by Cormyrean forces when they raided House DunRobar as a counterattack during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar. The loss of these weapons and their house members severely damaged DunRobars reputation in the city, weakening the alliance between them and House Szind and House Avithoul that led the drow war effort.
