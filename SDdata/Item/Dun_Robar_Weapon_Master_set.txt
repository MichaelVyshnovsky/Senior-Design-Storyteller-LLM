|Although Drow craftsmanship is among the finest in Faerun, few are foolhardy enough to steal from the owner of such a weapon.}}
==Description==
The weapons were universally exceptional-quality and matte black implements. It included [[drow]]-style weapons like [[bastard sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[greataxe]]s, [[khopesh]]es, [[light mace]]s, [[longsword]]s, [[maul]]s, [[quarterstaves]], [[rapier]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[shortsword]]s, and [[warhammer]]s, as well as [[dwarven waraxe]]s made for [[duergar]] soldiers.

==Powers==
The Dun'Robar weapons were made even more deadly with a variety of magical enhancements that improved the strikes and tactics that the wielder could use.

==History==
Many of these weapons were destroyed or stolen by [[Cormyr]]ean forces when they raided House Dun'Robar as a counterattack during the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]]. The loss of these weapons and their house members severely damaged Dun'Robar's reputation in the city, weakening the alliance between them and [[House Szind]] and [[House Avithoul]] that led the drow war effort.
