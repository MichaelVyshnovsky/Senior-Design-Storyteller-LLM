'''''Corruptor''''', was the favored [[weapon]] of [[Gargauth]], the [[Faer√ªn]]ian god of political corruption.

==Powers==
''Corruptor'' was a powerful [[enchanted]] ''+3 [[returning]] [[throwing]] [[dagger]]'' that could easily be welded in melee as well as as a ranged weapon. When Gargauth manifested an [[avatar]], he carried an infinite supply of these magic daggers. When a ''Corruptor'' was thrown, it disappeared and returned to Gargauth's avatar the moment it struck the target.
