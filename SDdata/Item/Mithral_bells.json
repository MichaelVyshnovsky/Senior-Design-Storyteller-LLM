        "mainbody": "Mithral bells were a type of enchanted bracelet.\nThese bracelets consisted of a small mithral chain of eleven mithral bells.\nEach of the elven bells that adorned these bracelets could be thrown as a grenade weapon, detonating with a sound burst effect. The bell would explode after  if it did not strike something first.\nAdditionally, while being worn the wearer would find greater success at attempted artistic performances, provided at least three bells remained on the mithral chain.\nMithral bells could only be crafted by bards."
