Lockpicks, or thieves picks were one of the most indispensible tools for a rogue.
A complete set of lockpicks included wires, angled wrenches, rods, oil, a small hammer, a magnifying glass, chisels, and acid.
A good set of lockpicks cost 30 gold, though sets of considerably inferior quality could be purchased for much less.
