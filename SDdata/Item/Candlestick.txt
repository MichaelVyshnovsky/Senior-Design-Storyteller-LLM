'''Candlesticks''' were candleholders  designed to hold a single [[candle]]. They could be found in many buildings and temples across the Realms, serving both a decorative and religious function. When designed to hold more than one candle, they were known as a [[candelabra]].

==Description==
Candlesticks varied greatly in size, shape, and the material used in their construction. Some came with small glass hoods to prevent the flame from being snuffed out by wind.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold a wide variety of candlesticks under its "Illumination"
* The [[Glow Shop]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold candlesticks made of [[brass]] or wood, but sometimes offered ones made of unusual or precious materials for a higher price.{{Cite polyhedron/48/The Living City: The Glow Shop|28}}

==Notable Users==
* Candlesticks were generally favored by various clerics and [[priest]]s.
* [[Sparkrender]], a [[blue dragon]] [[wyrmling]] that had a fondness for candlesticks.
