Skeleton keys were enchanted thieves tools from the 15 century DR.
These keys magically changed their shapes to fit any lock. Their magic ensured that only rogues and thieves could put them to use.
In the 15 century DR, various skeleton keys could be found in possession of thieves, scoundrels, criminals, and, of course, adventurers in the Sword Mountains, Neverwinter Wood, the city of Neverwinter, and Helms Hold, and could be found in the ruins of Illefarn.
