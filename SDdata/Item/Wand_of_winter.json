        "mainbody": "wand of winter was a magical wand that granted the wielder access powerful magical spells related to ice, snow, and other effects of intense cold.\nIt resembled a large icicle and felt just as cold in the wielders hand.\nThe wand possessed seven charges, one or more of which were expended every time it was used. Whomever wielded a wand of winter could use it to produce the spells ray of frost (without expending a charge), sleet storm, or ice storm.\nA number of the wands charges were restored each day. If it was ever completely exhausted of its power, there was a chance the wand would instantly melt and never be usable again.\n* Talis the White, one of the wyrmspeakers of the 15 century Cult of the Dragon."
