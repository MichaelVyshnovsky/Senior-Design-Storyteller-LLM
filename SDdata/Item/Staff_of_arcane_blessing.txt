A staff of arcane blessing was a magic staff associated with the goddess of magic Mystra that could be found in the Realms circa the late 15 century DR.
The staff emanated an aura of calmness and relaxation.
The wielder of a staff of arcane blessing was granted Mystras blessing, a boon that bolstered their spellcasting ability, prowess in combat, along with their natural defenses.
They were also granted the ability to bestow a lesser blessing upon their companions or others.
