        "mainbody": "Arsonists oil was a type of magic oil that turned resistance to fire to a vulnerability.\nArsonists oil was a white oil, usually packed in round glass containers that could be quickly opened and applied to weapons in the heat of battle or tossed at an enemy with ease.\nWhen a weapon coated with this oil stricken a creature or an object that possessed resistance to heat, flame, and high temperatures, such as a cambion, they immediately lost the protection from that element, becoming vulnerable to fire. The effects of this oil had no effect on those who were immune to fire.\nA recipe of this elixir required a mixture of alchemical sublimate of unmelting ice mephits frosted ears and certain types of ashes."
