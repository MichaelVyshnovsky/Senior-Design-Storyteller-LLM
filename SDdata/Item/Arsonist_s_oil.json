It splattered the cambion, and all at once its skin of brilliant carmine dulled to dark, a red like cheap wine, and the fiend vented this sound of anguish I almost pitied, for its very affinity for fire was now undone.''|An excerpt}}",
        "Description": "''Arsonist's oil'' was a white oil, usually packed in round [[glass]] containers that could be quickly opened and applied to weapons in the heat of battle or tossed at an enemy with ease.",
        "Powers": "When a weapon coated with this oil stricken a creature or an object that possessed resistance to heat, flame, and high temperatures, such as a [[cambion]], they immediately lost the protection from that element, becoming vulnerable to fire. The effects of this oil had no effect on those who were immune to fire.",
        "Creation": "A recipe of this elixir required a mixture of [[alchemical]] sublimate of unmelting [[ice mephit]]'s frosted ears and certain types of ashes."
