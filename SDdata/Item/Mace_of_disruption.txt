A '''''mace of disruption''''' was a weapon that could utterly obliterate [[undead]] by disrupting the reanimation magic

==Powers==
A ''+1 mace'', on impact, could destroy undead and lower-planes beings. Lesser undead such as [[skeleton]]s, [[zombie]]s, [[ghoul]]s and [[ghast]]s, [[shadow]]s, and [[wight]]s were instantaneously blasted into non-existence. Greater undead could resist this effect, such as [[wraith]]s, [[mummies]], [[spectre]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[lich]]es, in order of resilience, with evil lower-planes beings hardest to destroy, but even if they resisted, their injuries twice as severe as they would be normally.

The weapon bore a [[neutral good]] nature and powerful enchantments. Just touching it caused an evil being harm.{{Cite dragon/245/Sage Advice|17}}<ref group="note" name="Definition">In a Sage Advice column for [[Dragon magazine 245|''Dragon'' #245]], [[Skip Williams]] defines "touching" the mace as "...try[ing] to pick up, handle, or examine the item..." and that "nothing happens if someone pokes the [evil] creature with the item or throws it at the creature."

''Maces of disruption'' could be created with varied power levels. ''Lesser maces of disruption'' had the ability to slay [[undead]] upon a successful hit and produced  bright yellow light. 

==History==
[[File:Mace of disruption smash.jpg|thumb|335x335px]]
''Maces of disruption'' were popular among [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]] for their undead-slaying powers. One such cleric was captured as he attempted to infiltrate [[Thay]]. [[Szass Tam]] himself flayed the cleric alive as cautionary example for others and reanimated the husk as a [[zombie]] servant.

In [[1369 DR]] a ''mace of disruption'' could be found within the lair of a vampire [[Bodhi]] under [[Athkatla]]'s cemetery. Same year [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith in Athkatla, [[Cromwell]], knew how to increase the weapon's effectiveness by coating it with [[illithium]], making it a ''+2'' enchanted weapon.

In [[1372 DR]], ''maces of disruption'' of ''+2'' enchantment was created by blacksmith [[Marrok]] of [[Shining Knight Arms and Armor]] for the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. Later a variation with ''+5'' enchantment was created by [[Barun Silverblade]] of [[Beorunna's Well]].
