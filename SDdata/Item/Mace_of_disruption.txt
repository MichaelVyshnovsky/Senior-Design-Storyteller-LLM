A mace of disruption was a weapon that could utterly obliterate undead by disrupting the reanimation magic
A +1 mace, on impact, could destroy undead and lower-planes beings. Lesser undead such as skeletons, zombies, ghouls and ghasts, shadows, and wights were instantaneously blasted into non-existence. Greater undead could resist this effect, such as wraiths, mummies, spectres, vampires, ghosts, liches, in order of resilience, with evil lower-planes beings hardest to destroy, but even if they resisted, their injuries twice as severe as they would be normally.
The weapon bore a neutral good nature and powerful enchantments. Just touching it caused an evil being harm.In a Sage Advice column for Dragon #245, Skip Williams defines "touching" the mace as "...try[ing] to pick up, handle, or examine the item..." and that "nothing happens if someone pokes the [evil] creature with the item or throws it at the creature."
Maces of disruption could be created with varied power levels. Lesser maces of disruption had the ability to slay undead upon a successful hit and produced  bright yellow light.

Maces of disruption were popular among clerics of Lathander for their undead-slaying powers. One such cleric was captured as he attempted to infiltrate Thay. Szass Tam himself flayed the cleric alive as cautionary example for others and reanimated the husk as a zombie servant.
In 1369 DR a mace of disruption could be found within the lair of a vampire Bodhi under Athkatlas cemetery. Same year dwarven smith in Athkatla, Cromwell, knew how to increase the weapons effectiveness by coating it with illithium, making it a +2 enchanted weapon.
In 1372 DR, maces of disruption of +2 enchantment was created by blacksmith Marrok of Shining Knight Arms and Armor for the Hero of Neverwinter. Later a variation with +5 enchantment was created by Barun Silverblade of Beorunnas Well.
