Cocoa broth, also known as hot cocoa, was a beverage closely associated with halflings.
Cocoa broth was made using kaeth and a number of spices from Tukan. It was described as salty, sweet, and spicy at the same time. 
It was rumored that cocoa broth was first created when a halfling mage wished for "the perfect fireside beverage".
Cocoa broth could be found in several Waterdhavian coffee shops.
