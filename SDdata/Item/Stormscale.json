        "Powers": "''Stormscale'' was a set of chains made of a dark metal. It granted the wearer limited immunity to lightning and electricity and discharged a damaging spark of electricity on anyone landing a successful strike on the wearer, similar to the ''[[electric jolt]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "The first wearer of ''Stormscale'' was the infamous Dread Pirate Admiral [[Bluenose]] who served [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen. Admiral Bluenose parted with ''Stormscale'' sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}} when it was stored amongst Governor [[Blackeyes]]' buried treasures near [[Spindrift Town]] on the [[Nelanther Isles]] off the [[Sword Coast]]."
