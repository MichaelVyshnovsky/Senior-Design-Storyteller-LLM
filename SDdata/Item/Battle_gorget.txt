A '''''battle gorget''''' was a type of [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[gorget]] that protected the wearer's neck and throat from damage.

==Description==
The gorget consisted of a metal throat-shield and a series of overlapping metal plates that encircled the neck. The entire device was connected to a [[belt (item)|belt]] made of leather.

==Powers==
When worn, the ''battle gorget'' protected the wearer from physical strangulation such as the case if they were hung by a noose.

Once per day the wearer could evoke the effects of the spells ''[[lesser ironguard]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'' and ''[[firebeam]]''. If the wearer of the gorget were to fall from a significant distance, they could ease their descent as if they had cast the spell ''[[feather fall]]''. This power could be used twice per day.

==Notable Owners==
