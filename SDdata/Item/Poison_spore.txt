'''Poison spores''' were a substance extracted from [[myconid]] organs â€“ pockets of poisonous gas, that evolved to be their defense mechanism in the cruel and unyielding [[Underdark]].

==Usage==
Poison spores sacks were valued by [[alchemist]]s, who used them to produce ''[[noxious spore grenade]]s''. This thrown poisonous bomb-like weapon was the result of combining myconid poison spore sublimate (a sickly-sweet vapor distilled from the spores) and certain types of alchemical ashes.
