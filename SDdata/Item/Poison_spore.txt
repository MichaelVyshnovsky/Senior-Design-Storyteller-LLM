Poison spores were a substance extracted from myconid organs â€“ pockets of poisonous gas, that evolved to be their defense mechanism in the cruel and unyielding Underdark.
Poison spores sacks were valued by alchemists, who used them to produce noxious spore grenades. This thrown poisonous bomb-like weapon was the result of combining myconid poison spore sublimate (a sickly-sweet vapor distilled from the spores) and certain types of alchemical ashes.
