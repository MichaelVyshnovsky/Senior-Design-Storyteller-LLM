A '''key to the city''' was a small [[platinum]] [[key]] awarded to [[Ravens Bluff|Ravenian]] knights. It was one of the [[knightly honor]]s, and thus helped recipients climb the ranks of Ravens Bluff's knighthoods.

==History==
Keys to the city were bestowed upon knights who turned dangerous [[magic item]]s in to the knightly or civic authorities of Ravens Bluff.
