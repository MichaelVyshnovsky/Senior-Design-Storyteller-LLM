        "mainbody": "The '''''amulet of betrayal personified''''' was a powerful, yet [[curse]]d [[artifact]] that bestowed great powers upon its wearer.",
        "Description": "As its name suggested, the [[amulet]]'s creation was linked an individual who betrayed those closest to them. Their very souls had to be consumed by the amulet's crafter and molded together to form the artifact.\n\nIt emitted the horrible shrieks of the souls that were claimed in its creation",
        "Powers": "The wearer of the ''amulet of betrayal personified'' was granted tremendous power, both physical and mental. However they were left more susceptible to a variety of magical spells, or other effects that inflicted non-physical harm.\n\nThey gained immunity to [[negative energy]] but suffered tremendous damage from [[positive energy]], along with magic and weapons that were divine in nature.",
        "History": "It was believed that the [[Kalach-Cha]] was capable of creating this amulet, though it was unknown if they actually went through with it."
