The '''''serpent blades''''' were [[enchanted]] blades wielded by the members of the [[Cult of Tiamat]] in the city of [[Unthalass]], [[Unther]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These weapons were [[longsword]]s with their blades and hilts made out of emerald-green metal and appeared to be scaled. All ''serpent blades'' had round [[brass]] ring pommels, used to secure the weapons to the cultists' belts or tie them to a rope and drop down the hissing animated creature onto enemies from above, often used assassination method. A ''serpent blade'' was around {{SI|4'|'"|long=yes}} long.

==Powers==
The ''serpent blades'' animated when drawn from their [[scabbard]]s, becoming living hissing aggressive [[snake]]s that indiscriminately attacked all living creatures within their reach. The snake bites carried deadly and paralytic venom. Only individuals safe from the ''Serpent Blades'' were those wearing ''[[serpent ring]]s''.

==History==
At one point before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Elminster Aumar]] investigated the despicable activities of the Cult of [[Tiamat]] in Unthalass. He made his way into the dark deity's temple, towards its Altar of Scales, despite the cult's guards "dissuading." They wielded these curious magic weapons. The cult's High Priests, the Dark Scaled Ones of Unthalass, were known to carry similar weapons, but instead of swords, they used ''[[serpent whip|three-serpent-headed]] [[whip]]s''. Each head of that weapon could spit deadly corrosive [[poison|venom]] at its targets, as well as bite.
