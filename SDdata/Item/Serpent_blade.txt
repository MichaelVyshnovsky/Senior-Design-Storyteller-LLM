The serpent blades were enchanted blades wielded by the members of the Cult of Tiamat in the city of Unthalass, Unther in the 14 century DR.
These weapons were longswords with their blades and hilts made out of emerald-green metal and appeared to be scaled. All serpent blades had round brass ring pommels, used to secure the weapons to the cultists belts or tie them to a rope and drop down the hissing animated creature onto enemies from above, often used assassination method. A serpent blade was around  long.
The serpent blades animated when drawn from their scabbards, becoming living hissing aggressive snakes that indiscriminately attacked all living creatures within their reach. The snake bites carried deadly and paralytic venom. Only individuals safe from the Serpent Blades were those wearing serpent rings.
At one point before the 14 century DR, Elminster Aumar investigated the despicable activities of the Cult of Tiamat in Unthalass. He made his way into the dark deitys temple, towards its Altar of Scales, despite the cults guards "dissuading." They wielded these curious magic weapons. The cults High Priests, the Dark Scaled Ones of Unthalass, were known to carry similar weapons, but instead of swords, they used three-serpent-headed whips. Each head of that weapon could spit deadly corrosive venom at its targets, as well as bite.
