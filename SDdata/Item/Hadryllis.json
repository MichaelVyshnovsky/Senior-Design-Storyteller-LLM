        "mainbody": "'''''Hadryllis''''' was the legendary, [[Intelligent item|intelligent]] founding-[[sword]] of [[Rashemen]], which drove the [[demon]]s of [[Narfell]] away from the eastern [[magocracy]].",
        "Description": "The [[greatsword]] was masterfully crafted from [[cold iron]], its blade inscribed with [[Raumviran]] [[rune]]s that spelled out the name \"''Hadryllis''\" on either side. The hilt of the sword was wrapped in the hide of an [[aughisky]], an extremely rare carnivorous horse that was found in [[Lake Ashane]]. \n\n''Hadryllis'' had a strong and moody personality, constantly obsessed with slaying [[fiend]]s. It became withdrawn when no [[evil]] [[outsider]]s were present, and would urge its wielder to immediately jump into the fray if any [[demon]]s or [[devil]]s presented themselves. It would even ''[[Dominate person|dominate]]'' its wielder if they attempted to abstain from battle with any fiendish character.",
        "Powers": "The ''+3 intelligent [[cold iron]] greatsword'' was [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] as a [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] weapon and a [[bane]] to evil-[[alignment|aligned]] outsiders. It granted to its wielder the ability to cast ''[[detect magic]]'' at will and ''[[blindness]]'', ''[[bull's strength]]'', and ''[[invisibility purge]]'', each three times per day.\n\nIt possessed the unique power of being able to sever the [[Adamantine]] Binding that was found deep beneath the ruins of the [[Citadel of Conjurers]], located within the [[Moaning Gorge]] in [[Impiltur]].",
        "History": "The origins of ''Hadryllis'' were lost to the ages, but it was believed to have been crafted in ancient [[Raumathar]], centuries before the [[Dale Reckoning]]. It was possibly crafted by the first [[Vremyonni]], the \"Old Ones\" of Rashemen that specialized as [[arcane]] artisans. Their kind had a tale of a \"great blade forged by the gods... [used] to shatter the most unholy working of the [[Nar demonbinder]]s\".\n\nIt was most likely in the possession of the [[Witches of Rashemen]] when the empire fell in the [[-108 DR|Year of the Wands, −108 DR]] before it was bestowed to the great hero [[Yvengi]]. In the [[-75 DR|Year of Leather Shields, −75 DR]], the half-[[Rus]], half-[[Rashemi]] Yvengi defeated the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]], armed with ''Hadryllis'', driving his forces from the [[Unapproachable East]].\n\nAfter the fall of Eltab, ''Hadryllis'' served as the [[sword]] of state of Rashemen, having been wielded by the [[Iron Lord]]s for centuries. It was lost for a while during the conflicts surrounding the ascension of [[Bregg|Bregg the Strong]], when he was denied the title of Iron Lord by the [[Wychlaran]]. Some time after the [[194 DR|Year of the Coiling Smoke, 194 DR]], the sword appeared within the markets of [[Kensten]] in the nation of [[Thay]]. It was subsequently bought by a [[cleric]] of [[Anhur]], and returned to the city of [[Sultim]] in [[Mulhorand]]. An [[avatar]] of Anhur armed himself with ''Hadryllis'' to once again fend off Eltab during the [[War of Claws]] in the [[204 DR|Year of Avarice, 204 DR]]. The divine incarnation used the blade's unique [[magic]]al properties to imprison the demon lord beneath [[Thaymount]].\n\nFollowing the war, ''Hadryllis'' was returned to the [[Blood Fortress]] in Sultim, where it was believed to remain by the [[church of Anhur]]. In fact, it was stolen by the Wychlaran of Rashemen, and replaced with a near-exact replica. The true sword was returned to the nation's Iron Lords, kept out of sight in the royal court, but wielded in reserve in case Eltab returned again to [[Toril]].\n\nIn the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], an earthquake in Thay wrecked the Thayan capital of [[Eltabbar]], releasing Eltab from his prison. The Iron Lord entrusted ''Hadryllis'' to a band of adventurers, who wielded it in their efforts to stop the [[Zulkir]] of [[necromancy]], [[Szass Tam]], from binding Eltab to the [[artifact]] ''[[Thakorsil's Seat]]''<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[Champions of Valor]]'', this artifact is referred to as \"Thaksoril's seat\". by means of the ''[[ritual of twin burnings]]'' and the ''[[Rune of chaos|runes of chaos]]''. The Lord of the Hidden Layer was believed to have escaped the battle and ''Hadryllis'' went missing from the Realms once again."
