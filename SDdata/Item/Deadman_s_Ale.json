        "mainbody": "'''Deadman's Ale''' was a variety of colorfully-named [[ale]] created by [[Bowser]], a [[dwarf|dwarvish]] alesmith of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Deadman's Ale was a brew of meddling quality and medium potency, overall quite unremarkable. The ale's name came from the incident when Bowser sent a bottle of this drink to someone to test, and they were found dead the same night. The tester's death had nothing to do with the ale, as he died in a scuffle.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]]. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking â€“ [[Dark Maiden Wine]], to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making, including Deadman's Ale."
