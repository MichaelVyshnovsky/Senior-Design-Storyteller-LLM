        "mainbody": "Deadmans Ale was a variety of colorfully-named ale created by Bowser, a dwarvish alesmith of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nDeadmans Ale was a brew of meddling quality and medium potency, overall quite unremarkable. The ales name came from the incident when Bowser sent a bottle of this drink to someone to test, and they were found dead the same night. The testers death had nothing to do with the ale, as he died in a scuffle.\nIn the , Bowser of Ravens Bluff attended the year-end celebration festival in the town of Mossbridges in the Vast. The alesmith took his first attempt at winemaking â€“ Dark Maiden Wine, to the wine-tasting and grading competition. Even though the completion rules dictated Bowser could only bring one variety of wine, they said nothing about ale, so the dwarf brought all twelve types of ales of his making, including Deadmans Ale."
