The '''''Spellsparlker''''' was a unique [[quarterstaff]] crafted by the electric inventor [[Yrre|Yrre the Sparkstruck]].

==Powers==
Whenever the wielder of ''Spellsparkler'' harmed a person or creature with a magical [[spell]], electricity would course through their body.

==History==
Yrre the Sparkstruck intended to gift the ''Spellsparlker'' to the [[cleric]] of [[Mystra]] named [[Lenore]], an old lover, only to discover the Mystran's tower abandoned. Eventually, the staff came to be possessed by Counsellor [[Florrick]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] sometime in or before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
