        "mainbody": "'''''Pigsticker''''' was a derogatorily named enchanted [[spear]] that was created specifically to hunt [[orc]]s.",
        "Description": "''Pigsticker'' was a long pike with numerous etchings on its haft symbolizing the number of orcs slain by the weapon.",
        "Powers": "This pike possessed a ''+3'' enchantment and granted the user enhanced strength. However, when ''Pigsticker'' was wielded against orcs or [[orog]]s it became a powerful ''+5'' weapon.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Pigsticker'', along with ''[[Headsplitter]]'', were in the possession of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that occupied the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] at the time. The enchanted spear could be found in the part of the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] used as a prison by the cultists and the drow [[House Freth]] that was allied with them."
