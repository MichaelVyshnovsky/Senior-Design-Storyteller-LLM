        "mainbody": "A '''''talisman of divining''''' was a useful [[handglyph]] used by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]] as a [[divination]] tool. These items were the only non-deadly handglyphs created by the geomancers.",
        "Powers": "There was quite a variety in the forms of divination of these talismans could provide. Examples included the detection the following categories: magical and mundane traps, good and evil, [[undead]], gems, precious metals, poison, magic, invisibility, and secret doors. Regardless of the type, a talisman of divining offered detection within a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} radius. Physical barriers did not hinder the powers of detection. Strangely, the detection was blocked by liquid barriers of alcohol, salt water, iodine, or [[quicksilver]].\n\nMost ''talismans of divining'' had between 1â€”100 charges and could be recharged.",
        "Description": "These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes."
