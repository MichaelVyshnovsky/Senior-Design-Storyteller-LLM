Ethanniels sling was an enchanted elven sling that could deliver devastating blows with simple bullets as well as with unmissable magic missiles.
Ethanniels sling was designed like many other ancient elven slings, a hand-held solid curved launching device that propelled round bullets toward its targets with a single swing, unlike regular leather slings.
This sling possessed a potent +5 enchantment and increased its users  dexterity and reflexes. Additionally, Ethanniels sling could launch magic missiles projectiles instead of bullets. The number of magic missiles it could create was limited to six a day.
In 1369 DR, Ethanniels sling was looted off the corpse of one of the fallen AkhVelahr by the Cult of the Dragons dragonkin. The magical items they hoarded were stored inside the aerie in one of Castle Cormanthors towers that was used by the Cults winged troops as a breeding ground.
