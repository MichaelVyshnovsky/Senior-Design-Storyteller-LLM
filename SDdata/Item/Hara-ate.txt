The hara-ate was a type of armor used in Kara-Tur.
The hara-ate was a specialized armor ensemble created to safeguard the front of the wearers body. It featured a breastplate and thigh protectors constructed with interwoven armor plates. However, the back of the hara-ate remained exposed, leaving it vulnerable to attacks.
