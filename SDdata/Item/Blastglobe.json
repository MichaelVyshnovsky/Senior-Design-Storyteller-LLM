        "mainbody": "Blastglobes were a favored magical tool of the Graycloaks of the Neverwinter Guard.\nThese devices resembled bronze-hued glass spheres.\nWhen hurled (usually in battle), they released a powerful blast of pure concussive damage. Some blastglobes instead enclosed objects for delivery to the site, though they did not work for enclosing liquids, gases, or living things, even in stasis fields.\nBlastglobes were manufactured by the mages of the Many-Starred Cloak as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIn , the Kalach-Cha may have found a box of blastglobes, some of which were unstable and thus unsuited for use in battle. The unstable globes may have been used later to clear a rockfall in a mountain it is possible that he may have been informed about their uses by Grobnar Gnomehands to his recall, they had been last used in the far past, against an orcish horde of hundreds."
