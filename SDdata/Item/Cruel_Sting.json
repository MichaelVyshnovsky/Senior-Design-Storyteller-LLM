        "mainbody": "'''''Cruel Sting''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[longsword]] wielded by the mad [[drider]] [[Kar'niss]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "Just like a drider, ''Cruel Sting'' hid a magically replenishing [[poison]] inside and could trap its targets within ''[[web]]''. When the sword was wielded by a [[drow]], or a related creature, the ''sting the helpless'' enchantment added poison to the sword's strikes against those ensnared. Once per day, ''Cruel Sting'' could make an ''[[ensnaring strike]]'', trapping a creature within a ''web.''",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Cruel Sting'' was wielded by Kar'niss, a mad follower of [[the Absolute]], who acted as a guide to the Absolutists crossing the [[shadow-cursed lands]] on their way to the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the town of [[Reithwin]]."
