        "mainbody": "'''Darkdew''' was a [[perfume]] historically associated with ''femmes fatales'' across the [[Realms]] by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Darkdew was an opaque, black, [[oil]]y ointment that that was widely believed to had come from the [[Underdark]] and be a distillation of monster blood and sweat of licentious female [[drow]] [[elves]]. However, this was nothing but a salacious rumor. In reality, darkdew was a mix of three different plant oils, six kinds of [[herb]]s, and a distillate of [[slug]]s.\n\nWhen applied to the skin, Darkdew turned clear and lasted for about a day. It had a musky smell, pleasant and arousing to most species, from [[fey]] to [[goblinoid]]s. Its stimulating effects sometimes were much, much stronger for some [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]] and [[half-elves]]. This made ''darkdew'' a common purchase for their personal bedroom use.\n\nTo taste, the substance was similar to dark and bitter [[licorice]]."
