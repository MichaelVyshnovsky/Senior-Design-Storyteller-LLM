        "mainbody": "Darkdew was a perfume historically associated with femmes fatales across the Realms by the late 14 century DR.\nDarkdew was an opaque, black, oily ointment that that was widely believed to had come from the Underdark and be a distillation of monster blood and sweat of licentious female drow elves. However, this was nothing but a salacious rumor. In reality, darkdew was a mix of three different plant oils, six kinds of herbs, and a distillate of slugs.\nWhen applied to the skin, Darkdew turned clear and lasted for about a day. It had a musky smell, pleasant and arousing to most species, from fey to goblinoids. Its stimulating effects sometimes were much, much stronger for some humans, elves and half-elves. This made darkdew a common purchase for their personal bedroom use.\nTo taste, the substance was similar to dark and bitter licorice."
