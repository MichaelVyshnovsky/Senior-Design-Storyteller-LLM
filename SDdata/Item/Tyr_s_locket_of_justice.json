        "mainbody": "'''''Tyr's locket of justice''''' was a unique blessed [[amulet]] dedicated to the god [[Tyr]] Grimjaws, the Maimed God.",
        "Description": "This crudely-fashioned pendant was decorated with the motif of skulls and depicted a [[human]] head being devoured by [[wolf]]'s jaws, the image was a sigil of Tyr.",
        "Powers": "''Tyr's locket of justice'' held the enchantment that increased the wearer's wisdom and allowed them to cast the ''[[halt undead]]'' spell.",
        "History": "During the [[Weeping War]], the surviving defenders of the city opened a ''[[gate]]'' to a dark and evil place that spawned countless [[undead]] creatures in desperate attempt to fend off [[Army of Darkness]] that was overwhelming the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. The spellcasters who controlled the ''Nightmare Gate'' used ''Tyr's locket of justice'' to keep the undead under control. Eventually, the undead managed to scare the most of the [[orc]]s away from the Dwarven Dungeons. The ''Nightmare Gate'' was not closed in time and the undead infested the Dungeons as they were sealed off by the retreating survivors. The magic locket itself was left behind in the same chamber where the ''gate'' was active.\nIn [[1369 DR]], a group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] that sought to stop the [[Cult of Dragon]]'s nefarious plans in [[Myth Drannor]] eventually succeeded in closing the ancient ''Nightmare Gate'' using the ancient elven ''word of power'', ''Ogramirad, the Word of Constriction''. They retrieved ''Tyr's locket of justice'' after defeating he remaining undead.\n\nThe [[dark naga]] amulet collector [[Preybelish]] that resided in the Dwarven Dungeons during 1369 DR was trying to find ''Tyr's locket of justice'' to add to his collection."
