        "mainbody": "Tyrs locket of justice was a unique blessed amulet dedicated to the god Tyr Grimjaws, the Maimed God.\nThis crudely-fashioned pendant was decorated with the motif of skulls and depicted a human head being devoured by wolfs jaws, the image was a sigil of Tyr.\nTyrs locket of justice held the enchantment that increased the wearers wisdom and allowed them to cast the halt undead spell.\nDuring the Weeping War, the surviving defenders of the city opened a gate to a dark and evil place that spawned countless undead creatures in desperate attempt to fend off Army of Darkness that was overwhelming the Dwarven Dungeons. The spellcasters who controlled the Nightmare Gate used Tyrs locket of justice to keep the undead under control. Eventually, the undead managed to scare the most of the orcs away from the Dwarven Dungeons. The Nightmare Gate was not closed in time and the undead infested the Dungeons as they were sealed off by the retreating survivors. The magic locket itself was left behind in the same chamber where the gate was active.\nIn 1369 DR, a group of adventurers from Phlan that sought to stop the Cult of Dragons nefarious plans in Myth Drannor eventually succeeded in closing the ancient Nightmare Gate using the ancient elven word of power, Ogramirad, the Word of Constriction. They retrieved Tyrs locket of justice after defeating he remaining undead.\nThe dark naga amulet collector Preybelish that resided in the Dwarven Dungeons during 1369 DR was trying to find Tyrs locket of justice to add to his collection."
