Korred ropes were strange magic items woven by specialty priests of Shiallia called woodwives.
A woodwife could use her own hair to weave a korred rope within minutes. A korred rope remained animated for a full day after its completion. The rope could be tossed at enemies to entangle and immobilize them for several minutes. They could also be used to set ambush traps to snare intruders.
