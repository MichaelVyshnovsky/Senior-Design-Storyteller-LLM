        "mainbody": "Masons tools were sets of equipment that were used by masons to assist with the construction and maintenance of stonework.\nThese sets of tools included hammers, chisels, trowels, brushes, and squares. Those proficient with these tools were skilled at inspecting stonework and even spotting weak points in walls made of stone. This made them able to take down stone structures with ease. They were also able to determine the approximate date that stone buildings were constructed, as well as the potential builders. Dwarves were often proficient with these tools.\nThese kits were used in several places throughout Faer√ªn.\n* Thorvin Twinbeard, Xanathars top engineer who always carried masons tools, smiths tools, and thieves tools."
