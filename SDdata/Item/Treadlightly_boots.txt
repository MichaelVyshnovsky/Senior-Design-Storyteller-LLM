Treadlightly boots were mundane but masterfully crafted boots used by some inhabitants of the Ten-Towns in Icewind Dale in the early 14 century DR.
Treadlightly boots were non-magical items of clothing crafted out of soft doeskin with their soles padded to make the wearer move more silently.
Circa , a pair of treadlightly boots was sold by Elytharra Dinnesmore, the enchantress wife of Speaker Ulbrec Dinnesmore of Targos.
