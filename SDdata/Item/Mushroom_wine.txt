'''Mushroom wine''' was [[wine]] made from fermented [[mushroom]]s.

==Description==
It was generally a purplish It was produced by crushing and fermenting mushrooms in water for several months before straining and storing it. The length of the fermentation had implications for both the quality and the [[alcohol]] content of the final product. Mushroom wine was kept in [[barrel]]s or [[clay]] [[jug]]s.

==Reputation==
It was often described as being an acquired taste.

It was a popular drink among [[drow]].

==Availability==
Mushroom wine could be found in the [[Underdark]]. It was a major export of the [[beholder]]-run city of [[Zokir]] and the [[gold dwarf]] hold of [[Wildstar]] was infamous for its potent brew.

The village of [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] in [[northwest Faerûn]] had a local vintage in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], where it was served at the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]]. Described as an acquired taste by [[Volo]], their mushroom wine had a spicy and somewhat sweet flavor and was deep purple in color. Depending on demand and availability, the cost per tallglass could range from seven [[copper piece]]s to four [[gold piece]]s.

The village of [[Snowmantle]] in [[Daggerdale]] was known for its production and sale of mushroom wine, which was fermented in a facility on the south side of town. It was made from special mushrooms that grew only in the [[Border Forest]] around Snowmantle, notably to the town's west, north, and east.

The [[rock gnome]]s of [[Gnomengarde]] made a mushroom wine from special purple mushrooms that grew at the base of a waterfall around which their settlement was built. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Tervaround]] was in charge of making it.

The drow inhabitants of [[Svartalfheim]] in the [[Nidavellir]] layer of [[Ysgard]] were known for producing an excellent mushroom wine.

==History==
In the aptly named {{YearlinkName|238}}, persistent damp weather and widespread [[disease]] across [[north Faerûn]] created the ideal conditions for widespread and supernatural mushroom growth, which led to a short-term fad for mushroom food products including mushroom wine.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|34}}

After the [[Zhentarim]] occupied the town of Snowmantle in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, they identified mushroom wine as a potentially valuable trade good. As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, this had led them to preserve the parts of the Border Forest where the necessary mushrooms grew and to spare the life of the last living person who knew the secret of its production, [[Willard Gooseford]].
