        "mainbody": "'''''Beirmoura''''' was a legendary sword of [[Thentia]]. Known also as the \"Bright Sword\" of Thentia, it was forged to slay wizards.{{Cite adventurers league/Blood Above, Blood Below|17}}",
        "Powers": "Beirmoura was a [[Sentient item|sentient]] weapon capable of hovering in the air. In addition to such powers, it was capable of casting [[see invisibility|detect invisibility, 10' radius]] and [[ESP]] as a single spell, three times per day. It also reflected magic 100% of the time, absorbed [[magic missile]]s, and was immune to fire, heat, and electricity, though it was weak against cold. The sword was telepathic, capable of reading any language or magical script.\n\nIt was also a spellcaster in its own right. Amongst the spells it knew in {{yearlink|1373}} were ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', and ''[[stoneskin]]''.",
        "History": "Per a book, \"The Cult of the Bright Sword\", the blade had been created as part of a series of wizard-slaying swords by a mage a long time ago, in order to slay the wizards of [[Netheril]], and at some point a cult around it had sprung in Thentia. Per [[Elminster]], it was uncertain whether the sword held an evil entity from the outer planes, perhaps a wizard- or perhaps there was an even darker power behind it.\n\nAround [[1367 DR]], there existed a sort of cult in Thentia that venerated this sword. Around that time Beirmoura traveled throughout the dark underpassages of Thentia, tracking down anyone with a [[magical item]] that crossed its path.\n\nPer his journal, [[Bale Khodolis]] of Thentia acquired this sword in {{yearlink|1373}} and used it to slay a rival of his', [[Gideon Birneir]]. Several tendays later, the sword asserted its will over him, using him to organize a \"Thentian Resistance Army\" made of his fellow, inexperienced nobles for an attack against a [[Shadovar]] search party in the ruins of [[Candlemas]]. Beirmoura joined the [[Hero of Daggerford]] that year as a companion; they shared information regarding the sword ''[[Dominion (sword)|Dominion]]'', one of the [[Five Blades of Netheril]] which it intended to hunt down and bury out of reach.",
        "Rumors": "Travelers' tales supposed that the Bright Sword cult was inspired by the [[Ghost Swords]] of [[Turmish]], which appeared to protect and aid the people of the land.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/98/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Hidden Powers of Turmish|23-24}}"
