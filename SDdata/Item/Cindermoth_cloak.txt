'''''Cindermoth cloaks''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[cloak]]s that retaliated at those attacking its wearer with a searing blast of flame.

==Description==
Even the lightest rustle of the cloak's fabric released tiny [[moth]]s of cinder that fluttered around their home and soon disappeared.

==Powers==
Each successful attack on the cloak's wearer activated its magic â€“ the ''flaming shroud'' enchantment that blasted a line of flames at the attacker.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''cindermoth cloak'' belonged to the mad sewer-dwelling grease-[[mage]] named [[Aelis Siryasius]], who inhabited the [[sewers of Baldur's Gate]] with a small army of [[grease mephit]]s, [[grease elemental]]s, and [[greaseball]]s.
