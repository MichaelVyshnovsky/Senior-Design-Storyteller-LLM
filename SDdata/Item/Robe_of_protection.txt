A robe of protection was a robe that was enchanted to protect the wearer.
The magical robes provided different levels of protection, depending on how highly enchanted they were. As mages fought unarmored, these robes were more likely to be worn by them, instead of others that were proficient at wearing armor. However, the robes could still be worn by those of other professions, such as clerics, providing their enchantment was strong enough.
