        "mainbody": "A '''mithral shirt''' was an exceptionally light shirt of [[chainmail]] made from fine links of [[mithral]].",
        "Description": "A mithral shirt was a form of nonmagical armor that was much lighter and less constricting than a typical [[chain shirt]]. A mithral shirt sized for a [[human]]-sized creature weighed about ten pounds (five kilograms) and sold for about 1,100 [[gp|gold pieces]].",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Mirt|Mirt the Moneylender]] owned a mithral shirt that was magically [[glamered]] to look like ordinary clothing. The [[Silverymoon|Silvaeren]] scroll merchant [[Xara Tantlor]] wore a mithral shirt that allowed her to move silently. [[Sovial]], a [[Hand of the Adama]] from the [[Shining Lands]], also possessed a magical mithral shirt, as did [[Blackteeth]], the leader of the [[gnoll]]s who were a part of the [[Reavers]] gang of bandits in the [[Forest of Amtar]]. [[Khemal Serist]], a [[cultist of the Shattered Peak]], owned an enchanted mithral shirt as well. [[Zabbas Thuul]], an infamous thief of [[Waterdeep]], had a [[slick]] mithral shirt that always seemed covered in grease, allowing him to escape more easily through tight spaces."
