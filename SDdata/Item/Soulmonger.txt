The '''''Soulmonger''''' was an immensely powerful [[magic]] [[artifact]] constructed by the [[demilich]] [[Acererak]]. It was able to drain the life of any living individual on [[Toril]] who had been resurrected at some point in the past, and furthermore to capture the [[soul]]s of creatures as they died anywhere on Toril.

The activation of the ''Soulmonger'' in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] started a worldwide emergency known as the [[death curse]].{{ToA-time}}

==Description==
The ''Soulmonger'' was an upright crystalline cylinder that was {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} tall. Through the crystal could be glimpsed the forms of the spirits trapped inside, and their otherworldly screams echoed around the artifact. To protect itself, four {{SIAdj|30|foot|long=yes|adj=long}} tentacles protruded from the top of the device, and would lash out and throw around any who attempted to damage it. The primary purpose of the ''Soulmonger'' was to feed souls to an [[atropal]], which floated alongside it and was connected to the cylinder via its umbilical cord.

The device was located on the very lowest level of the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] behind a great stone gate adorned with skeletal carvings that required multiple special keys in order to open. The ''Soulmonger'' was suspended {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} above a large, triangular pool of lava by three [[adamantine]] struts which connected to an adamantine ring around the middle of the cylinder. These struts were each wide and sturdy enough to walk across but not strong enough to support the weight of the ''Soulmonger'' without the other two.

The ''Soulmonger'' itself was an intensely [[evil]] device that radiated intense [[necromantic]] [[magic]]. If destroyed, the countless souls trapped within the cylinder would escape as motes of light that swirled together like a tornado before vanishing to the [[afterlife]] in a bright flash.

==History==
The ''Soulmonger'' was originally constructed by Acererak and a coven of night hag witches known as the [[Sewn Sisters]], whom he recruited for their expertise in crafting ''soul bags''. Once the ''Soulmonger'' was activated and began inflicting the death curse across the world, it was watched over by the Sewn Sisters with Acererak keeping an eye on it from afar.

The ''Soulmonger'' was ultimately destroyed and shattered into pieces when a group of adventurers made their way through the tomb and defeated Acererak. However, shards of it spread across [[Chult]], and came to be coveted for dark purposes by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], the [[demon prince]] [[Orcus]], and [[yuan-ti]] cultists of [[Dendar the Night Serpent]].{{Cite adventurers league/Streams of Crimson|3}}{{Cite adventurers league/Pools of Cerulean|3}} The [[lich]] [[Rhaugilath]] also crafted an imitation of the ''Soulmonger''&mdash;albeit one that operated on a much more limited scale&mdash;known as the ''[[Death of the Sun]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Fathomless Pits of Ill Intent|6}}

Ultimately, [[Szass Tam]] would succeed in having his agents&mdash;including multiple [[zulkir]]s&mdash;absorb the power of the shards of the ''Soulmonger'' into special ''[[opal pendant]]s'',{{Cite adventurers league/Pools of Cerulean|4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|3}} and then attempted to use the artifact's power to release Dendar from her prison beneath Chult. Tam had been fooled into believing that Dendar had visited him and his servants in their dreams, and that she had promised that if they released her, she would fulfill her purpose to end all life on Toril but then leave the Red Wizards as rulers over an undead world. In truth, this was a ruse devised by Rhaugilath, who sought to claim the power of the ''Soulmonger'' for himself in order to break free of his servitude to the Shadow King [[Larloch]].{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|5-6}} Rhaugilath had been manipulating Thay, the yuan-ti, and a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Port Nyanzaru]] even since before the destruction of the ''Soulmonger'' in order to get his hands on the device's power.{{Cite adventurers league/Whispers in the Dark|3}} When Tam put the final stages of his plan into motion by sending the zulkir [[Ethra Dralas]] to the [[Maze of Ubtao]], Rhaugilath set in motion his plan to trick the Thayans and a party of adventurers into clashing, which they did just as Dendar's prison was about to open thanks to the power of the ''Soulmonger'' in the ''opal pendants''.{{Cite adventurers league/Turn Back the Endless Night|19}}
