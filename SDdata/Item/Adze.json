        "mainbody": "An '''adze''' was a common [[axe]]-like woodworking tool found in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "The adze resembled an axe with its head turned sideways, somewhat like a [[mattock]] or [[hoe]]. It could be made with a stone head if necessary, but would be made from a durable metal if at all possible.",
        "Availability": "Adzes were basic tools commonly made by blacksmiths and bought up by carpenters, shipwrights, and anyone else who worked wood.",
        "Usage": "An adze was an important part of any toolkit for basic woodworking, alongside a [[chisel]], [[hatchet]], [[saw]], [[hammer]], [[nail]]s, a [[plane (tool)|plane]], a [[square]], and a [[ruler]].\n\nAn adze could also be used as a clumsy weapon in an emergency, similar to a [[hand axe]],{{Cite dragon/97/Sticks, stones, and bones|10,12}} with shorter-handled varieties used specifically for war.\n\nThe ''[[wood shape]]'' spell used a miniature carpenter's adze as a [[material component]]."
