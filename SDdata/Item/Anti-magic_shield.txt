Anti-Magic Shields, sometimes also referred to as Mage-Killers, were large enchanted shields often used against arcane spellcasters.
Anti-Magic Shields possessed +2 enchantments that kept their used safe from physical harm, while their powerful spell resistance kept the wielders safe from magics.
Historically, these shields could be seen in the hands of the most skilled mercenaries and assassins who targeted powerful mages. Anti-Magic Shields were nuisances even to such adepts at the Art as Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep. However, many common folk said that these Mage-Killers simple "leveled the field".
In 1373 DR, Mage-Killer was among possessions of the Zhentarim squad stationed in Iyrauroths swamp in Thar.
