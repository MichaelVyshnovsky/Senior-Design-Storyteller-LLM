'''''Grimwald's dagger''''' was a ''+1 [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[dagger]]'' that, when drawn, emitted the continuous noise of an angry, yapping dog and even louder barking noises when it struck an opponent. This effect would often cause the victim to helplessly burst out into laughter.

Once per day the wielder could, at will, cause the blade to emanate a shrill scream that ''[[haste]]d'' its attacks and greatly increased the damage it dealt.

==Usage==
These daggers were first popularized by Lady [[Alustriel Silverhand]] of [[Silverymoon]] and were named after the aged [[wizard]] [[Grimwald]] who delighted in taunting his [[cat]]s.{{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}
