        "mainbody": "Cowls of warding were types of enchanted headwear created by the clerics of Mask and used by the Shadow Thieves of Amn.\nCowls of warding were made out of thick black cloth that covered the wearers entire face, leaving only a slit exposing their eyes.\nCowls of warding were enchanted to shield the wearer from mind-affecting spells and rendered them unrestrained as if under the effects of the freedom spell.\nThese pieces of protective headgear were originally created by the clergy of Mask, the god of thieves. Closer to the 14 century DR, similar items were commissioned by Amnian Shadow Thieves. By the late 14 century DR, these cowls could be found in several places across the Sword Coast"
