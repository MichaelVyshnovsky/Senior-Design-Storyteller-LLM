        "History": "These pieces of protective headgear were originally created by the clergy of Mask, the god of thieves. Closer to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], similar items were commissioned by Amnian Shadow Thieves. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, these cowls could be found in several places across the [[Sword Coast]]"
