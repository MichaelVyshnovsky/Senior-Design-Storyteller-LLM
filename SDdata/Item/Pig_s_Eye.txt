Pigs Eye, originally named Gruumshacan, was the elven enchanted short sword created to slaughter orcs.
Pigs Eye was a beautiful sword with a decorated blade and with an orcish glass eye embedded in its hilt. The swords name and the glass eye were a reference to the legend of Corellon, the father of elves, and Gruumsh, and their famous battle in which the orcish god lost his eye to the First of the Seldarine.
Gruumshacan was a Moonblade of the House Caith. It possessed a +2 enchantment, which dramatically grew in strength when the sword was wielded against orcs. Upon a successful hit, Pigs Eye had a coin-toss of a chance of blinding its orc target.
Gruumshacan was crafted in the  by an elven enchanter named Shenarr Caith for his ranger cousin, Velaic Caith. The ranger wielded the Pigs Eye against vile orcs of Cormanthor who menaced the City of Song, Myth Drannor. The blade was passed along to the rangers son Tredain Caith and grandson, Galesic Caith. The sword remained within the family for many centuries until House Caith decided to relocate to Evermeet. The family decided to sell Gruumshacan, the familys invaluable Moonblade, to finance their aged uncle Shenarr Caiths transformation into a baelnorn. Shenarr found it amusing that Pigs Eye allowed him to avoid natural death.
By 1281 DR, Gruumshacan ended up in the hands of Conlan, the proprietor of Kuldahars blacksmith shop.
