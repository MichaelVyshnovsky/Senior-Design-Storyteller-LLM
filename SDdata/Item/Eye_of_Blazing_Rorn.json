The [[dragonborn]] heroines [[Iskdara]] and [[Shurideh]] stole it from its custodian, a [[silver dragon]] named [[Asativarainuth]], during the [[battle of Arambar Gulch]].\n\nThe dragonborn used the Eye during the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]] to destroy the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]] by throwing the Eye into the mountain, that was actually a sleeping volcano, triggering a powerful explosion that not only destroyed the mountain but also killed the [[red dragon]] [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].\n\nAt some point, the Eye was recovered by the dragonborn. Since then, the artifact was under the custody of members of [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]].",
