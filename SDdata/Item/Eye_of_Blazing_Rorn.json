        "mainbody": "he Eye of Blazing Rorn was a powerful dragon artifact.\nThe Eye of Blazing Rorn was literally the eye of the primordial Rorn. It had the form of a ruby.\nThe Eye of Blazing Rorn had the ability to channel the fury of Rorn, detonating powerful explosions of heat.\nThe dragons created this artifact by using one of the eyes of Rorn, who lost it during the War of Fang and Talon. The dragonborn heroines Iskdara and Shurideh stole it from its custodian, a silver dragon named Asativarainuth, during the battle of Arambar Gulch.\nThe dragonborn used the Eye during the Battle of the Crippled Mountain to destroy the Celestial Mountain by throwing the Eye into the mountain, that was actually a sleeping volcano, triggering a powerful explosion that not only destroyed the mountain but also killed the red dragon Rhodrolytharnestrix.\nAt some point, the Eye was recovered by the dragonborn. Since then, the artifact was under the custody of members of Clan Verthisathurgiesh.\nCategoryArtifacts\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryItems\nCategoryItems from Djerad Thymar\nCategoryItems from Tymanther\nCategoryItems from East Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Tymanchebar\nCategoryItems from Laerakond\nCategoryItems from Abeir\ndfyd24qj6ii71px9gplkzspv2z3xvgk"
