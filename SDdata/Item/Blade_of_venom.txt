Blades of venom were fairly common enchanted short swords in Myth Drannor before the Weeping War.
Blades of venom appeared inconspicuous, not showing their deadly enchantment that coated the edge of the sword with magic poison.
Blades of venoms enchantment added additional poison damaged upon hit.
In 1369 DR, during the Cult of the Dragons occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, some of these swords could be found among disturbed and looted graves of the Dwarven Dungeons. One could be found inside a chest in the Halls of Stone and another in the Deep Halls among the ruins of an old war-time infirmary.
