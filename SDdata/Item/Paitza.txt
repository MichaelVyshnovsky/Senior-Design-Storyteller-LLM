A '''''paitza''''' was a warrant of safe passage through [[Tuigan]] lands in the [[Hordelands]]. It served as a symbol of the ''khahans'' favor, leaving anyone who carried one free to roam the vast steppe unmolested.

==Description==
''Paitzas'' were usually made from metal and measured roughly a foot in length and were several inches wide. The kind of metal used for a specific ''paitza'' was a symbol of the ''khahans'' favor, with more expensive metals signifying higher favor. A hole at one end was looped with a leather thong for easy attachment. The ''khahans'' personal seal, that of a tiger face, was inscribed onto the ''paitza'' along with a simple message.

==History==
The [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]] [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]] was granted a [[gold]]en ''paitza'' for his services to [[Yamun Khahan]] of the [[Tuigan Horde]]. He doubted it would be very useful after the khahan's death, however, and considered leaving it as a gift to the temple of [[Deneir]] in [[Procampur]].
