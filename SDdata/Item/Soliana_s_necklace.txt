'''''Soliana's necklace''''' was an [[enchanted]] piece of jewelry gifted to "Princess" [[Soliana]] by her adoptive mother—the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The necklace was a simple small [[gold]]en [[amulet]].

==Powers==
This unique magic amulet contained strong [[hag]] magic that, once activated, could transform Soliana back to her original form of a [[hawk]]. When creatures other than Soliana wore her necklace, they did not ''[[polymorph]]'' into a hawk but rather gained enhanced abilities of a bird of prey. The wearer received the boon of hawk's alertness, its superb hearing, eyesight, and magically had their charisma improved. Additionally, the wearer could cast the ''[[eagle's splendor]]'' [[spell]] once per day.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a young "Princess" captured the heart of Sir [[Griswald]] and a corrupt money-hungry noble scion named [[Feldran Exeltis]]. The woman was captured via lies and hollow promises by the nobleman and kept in [[Castle Exeltis]]. Unbeknownst to most, the princess from a faraway exotic land was a ''polymorphed'' hawk and adopted daughter of the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh. Soliana's swamp-dwelling parent made this enchanted necklace in case she ever wanted to abandon the human shape and return to the simple life of a hawk. Soliana kept the necklace close to her heart, ready to transform herself into a bird. Some stories claimed that Soliana used the amulet's magic to escape imprisonment, while others talked about a more romantic fate–the woman reunited with her lover Sir Griswald and embraced humanity. If this was indeed true, she was said to have gifted the magic necklace to the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who helped Sir Griswald to bring Feldran Exeltis to justice.
