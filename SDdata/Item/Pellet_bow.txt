A '''pellet bow''' was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]]

==Description==
A pellet bow closely resembled a conventional [[bow]] in both construction and application. However, it deviated in its method of ammunition deployment. Instead of launching regular [[arrow]]s, it featured a small [[sling]] integrated into the bowstring, designed to hold a tiny stone, clay pellet, or lead projectile. The firing technique also differed from that of a typical bow. The specialized sling enabled a significantly more powerful ejection of the projectile when compared to a conventional sling.
