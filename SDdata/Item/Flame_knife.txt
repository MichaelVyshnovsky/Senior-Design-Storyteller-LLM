'''''Flame knives''''' were special weapons used by [[holy slayer]] [[assassin]]s in [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
These knives had a wavy blade.

==Uses==
Members of the [[Flamedeath Fellowship]] used these wicked blades smeared with [[pitch]] or even [[oil of liquid stars]]. The oil was set aflame and wielded in combat. Members of the Flamedeath Fellowship preferred using this tactic at night to intimidate their opponents. The dagger was often left behind as a warning sign to keep others from straying from the path the fellowship endorsed.

==Price==
''Flame knives'' cost 2 [[gold piece]]s.
