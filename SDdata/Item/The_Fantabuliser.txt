The Fantabuliser was a strange musical instrument created by a duo of artificers Evani and "Silhouette" of Waterdeep.

The device quickly became a famous and hight sought after act that Evani took on the road. In 1372 DR, she was convinced to perform in Holdfast Inn of Liams Hold, a venue popular among traveling patrons of the arts. After the musical set up her monstrous gadget, she retired to her room after a long journey. When she woke up - the the Fantabuliser was non-functioning. Sabotage! Evani feverishly tried to repair the machine bur it was missing an essential components and would never work without it.
