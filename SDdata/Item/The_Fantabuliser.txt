==Description==
''Evani's Fantabuliser'' was a highly eccentric and complex device. It could be described as a jumble of gears, lenses, and various rotating gizmos and gadgets.

==History==
''The Fantabuliser'' was concocted sometime before 1372 DR by Evani and her dear but mysterious friend known only as "Silhouette." The device quickly became a famous and hight sought after act that Evani took on the road. In 1372 DR, she was convinced to perform in [[Holdfast Inn]] of [[Liam's Hold]], a venue popular among traveling patrons of the arts. After the musical set up her monstrous gadget, she retired to her room after a long journey. When she woke up - the ''the Fantabuliser'' was non-functioning. Sabotage! Evani feverishly tried to repair the machine bur it was missing an essential components and would never work without it.
