        "mainbody": "clockwork amulet was a magical amulet that removed all variability due to chance from a single action.\nThe copper amulet contained small internal gears that constantly emitted a very faint sound of clicking and whirring.\nThe clockwork amulet drew its magic from the Outer Plane of Mechanus. Once per day, its wearer could use the amulet and invoke exact predictability from a single attack. The amulet ensured that the outcome of the attack was perfectly average, given the wearers abilities. The amulet then regained its magic at the next dawn."
