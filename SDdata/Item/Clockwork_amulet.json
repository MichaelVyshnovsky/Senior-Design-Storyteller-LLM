        "mainbody": "A '''''clockwork amulet''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] amulet that removed all variability due to chance from a single action.",
        "Description": "The [[copper]] amulet contained small internal gears that constantly emitted a very faint sound of clicking and whirring.",
        "Powers": "The ''clockwork amulet'' drew its magic from the [[Outer Planes|Outer Plane]] of [[Mechanus]]. Once per day, its wearer could use the amulet and invoke exact predictability from a single attack. The amulet ensured that the outcome of the attack was perfectly average, given the wearer's abilities. The amulet then regained its magic at the next dawn."
