        "mainbody": "A staff sling, also known as a fustibalus, was a staff that had a pocketed thong attached to its tip. They were available in many places across Faer√ªn, even in the Underdark.\nStaff slings were large ranged weapons, about  in length, used to launch bullets or heavy stones.\n* Keira Nierna\n* Drow were known to use staff slings to launch flash globes at their enemies.\n* Rangers specialized in killing large foes, such as giants, were proficient at using these weapons. As their targets were much larger than average, there was a much higher change of the launched missiles hitting. Protectors of the wilderness and those that explored mountains also made use of staff slings.\n* Clerics of the deities Corellon Larethian and Cyrrollalee sometimes carried these weapons when adventuring. The specialty priests and priestesses of several other deities were also known to be proficient in their use, such as the Halcyons of Aerdrie Faenya, Lone Wolves of Fenmarel Mestarine, Chronologians of Labelas Enoreth, Hoodwinkers of Baravar Cloakshadow, Greenfosters of Sheela Peryroyl, and the Peacemen of Eldath.\n* Some worshipers of deities of the Untheric pantheon and the Mulhorandi pantheon were also known to use these weapons. Specialty priests of Gilgeam, known as Martinets, were proficient at using staff slings, as were the Sunhawks of Horus-Re, and the Divine Arbitrators of Osiris."
