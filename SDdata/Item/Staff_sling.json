        "mainbody": "A '''staff sling''', also known as a '''fustibalus''', was a [[staff]] that had a pocketed thong attached to its tip. They were available in many places across [[Faerûn]], even in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "Staff slings were large ranged weapons, about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length, used to launch bullets or heavy stones.",
        "Notable Users": {
            "Individuals": "* [[Keira Nierna]]{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993}}",
            "Groups": "* [[Drow]] were known to use staff slings to launch [[flash globe]]s at their enemies.\n* [[Ranger]]s specialized in killing large foes, such as [[giant]]s, were proficient at using these weapons. As their targets were much larger than average, there was a much higher change of the launched missiles hitting. Protectors of the wilderness and those that explored mountains also made use of staff slings.",
            "Religions": "* [[Cleric]]s of the deities [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Cyrrollalee]] sometimes carried these weapons when adventuring. The [[specialty priest]]s and priestesses of several other deities were also known to be proficient in their use, such as the [[Halcyon (specialty priest)|Halcyons]] of [[Aerdrie Faenya]], [[Lone Wolf|Lone Wolves]] of [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], [[Chronologian]]s of [[Labelas Enoreth]], [[Hoodwinker]]s of [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], [[Greenfoster]]s of [[Sheela Peryroyl]], and the Peacemen of [[Eldath]].\n* Some worshipers of deities of the [[Untheric pantheon]] and the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] were also known to use these weapons. Specialty priests of [[Gilgeam]], known as [[Martinet]]s, were proficient at using staff slings, as were the [[Sunhawk]]s of [[Horus-Re]], and the [[Divine Arbitrators]] of [[Osiris]]."
