The '''''intricate rings''''' were a set of metal rings that were crafted and [[enchanted]] by [[Coriolis Rillevay]] for use in battle. It could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''rings'' hovered just above the wielder's head, and could be directed to strike at a nearby enemy, although sometimes the ''rings'' seemed to choose additional targets at random.

==Notable Owners==
