The intricate rings were a set of metal rings that were crafted and enchanted by Coriolis Rillevay for use in battle. It could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
The rings hovered just above the wielders head, and could be directed to strike at a nearby enemy, although sometimes the rings seemed to choose additional targets at random.
