Ithbank was a wine, produced in Tethyr. It was exported as far as the Western Heartlands, the lands along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.
Ithbank was known for its layered expressive flavor akin to a bards melody. It was sold in tall corked bottles of green glass.
