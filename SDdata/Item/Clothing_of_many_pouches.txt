A broad range of [[enchanted]] clothing in the Realms, united by the moniker "'''''of many pouches'''''" or "'''''of many pockets'''''", referring to their extra-dimensional [[pouch]]es that allowed wearers to carry large quantities of items. While they could take the form of [[apron]]s,{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-04-23 - Jotunslayers}} or [[robe]]s, they were most commonly belts or [[girdle]]s.

==Description==
These items bore a mundane appearance.

==Powers==
Some of these clothes radiated a strong [[aura]] of [[enchantment]] magic, as well as a faint aura of [[alteration]] magic, whilst others radiated a moderate aura of [[conjuration]] magic.

These clothes had eight small pockets or pouches. In the case of a ''girdle of many pouches'', these were located on the inner front surface. Within each of these eight pouches were hidden seven additional pouches, totaling up to 64. All of these pouches acted like miniature ''[[bag of holding]]s'', allowing their wearer to carry up to {{SI|1|cu ft|long=yes}} of material weighing up to {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}} within each pouch. Additionally, [[familiar]]s could be stored within a pouch regardless of its size of weight. While stored a familiar lost their need for air, food, or water. Any other creature of appropriate size stored within one of the pouches still experienced their bodily needs and would only have enough air to survive for one minute.

While worn, the contained items were effectively weightless, but whilst not worn the clothing would weigh {{Frac|1|10}} of the total weight of all items stored within.
