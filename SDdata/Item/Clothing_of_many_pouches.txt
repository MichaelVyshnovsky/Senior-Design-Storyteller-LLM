A broad range of enchanted clothing in the Realms, united by the moniker "of many pouches" or "of many pockets", referring to their extra-dimensional pouches that allowed wearers to carry large quantities of items. While they could take the form of aprons, or robes, they were most commonly belts or girdles.
These items bore a mundane appearance.
Some of these clothes radiated a strong aura of enchantment magic, as well as a faint aura of alteration magic, whilst others radiated a moderate aura of conjuration magic.
These clothes had eight small pockets or pouches. In the case of a girdle of many pouches, these were located on the inner front surface. Within each of these eight pouches were hidden seven additional pouches, totaling up to 64. All of these pouches acted like miniature bag of holdings, allowing their wearer to carry up to  of material weighing up to  within each pouch. Additionally, familiars could be stored within a pouch regardless of its size of weight. While stored a familiar lost their need for air, food, or water. Any other creature of appropriate size stored within one of the pouches still experienced their bodily needs and would only have enough air to survive for one minute.
While worn, the contained items were effectively weightless, but whilst not worn the clothing would weigh  of the total weight of all items stored within.
