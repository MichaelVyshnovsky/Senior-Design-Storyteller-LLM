        "mainbody": "'''''Doorknocker''''' was an [[enchanted]] bludgeon once wielded by an explorer named [[Pasi]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "This [[club]] possessed magics that dealt additional bludgeoning damage to its targets and discharged a ''[[knock]]'' spell onto locked objects when struck against them.",
        "History": "''Doorknocker'' accompanied its mistress, the [[tiefling]] adventurer Pasi, into dangerous treasure-hunting delves to [[Tier Lathadun‎]] where its magic came in handy dispatching [[undead]] monsters and opening ancient locked doors. Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Pasi met her doom in Tier Lathadun‎ after she slipped and plummeted to her death. Her body and the weapon were thought to be lost, until ''Doorknocker'' reappeared within a chest in [[Umgatlik's shrine]] on the [[Crab's Claw Coast]] in 1372 DR, which was being excavated by a group of [[Waterdhavian]] archeologists."
