'''Imp''' was a sentient [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] that delighted in causing problems.

==Description==
The sword was decorated lavishly with [[gem]]stones and had a [[gold]] and [[silver]] trim.

==Personality==
''Imp'' was extremely contrarian and mischievous, lying and misleading at random, and opposing any who seemed to have a [[lawful]] alignment. It was also extremely jealous of any other weapons its wielder might have, and would destroy them given the chance. If it ever controlled the wielder, it would prove its authority and power by forcing them to perform demeaning tricks.

==Powers==
''Imp'' could detect invisible objects, detect gems with great accuracy, and increase the bearer's strength once per day. It could also ''[[dispel magic]]'' with some effectiveness, and heal its wielder as it inflicted wounds.

==History==
According to ''Imp'', it was found by [[Adzerak]] in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]] and had remained in [[Barrenstone]] until it could've been found by [[adventurer]]s in the {{yearlinkName|1369}}.
