The '''''Heart of Bane''''' was a powerful [[artifact]] and an evil relic that possessed a fearsome power to corrupt.{{Cite trumpeter/1-9|2}}

==History==
The ''Heart of Bane'' was believed to had been stolen from the [[Outer Planes]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}} by a bold or foolish adventurer. The artifact was hidden within [[Ravens Bluff]]. By 1370 DR, it became overly clear that the hidden evil relic possessed a powerful corrupting influence and served as a beacon, attracting creatures from the [[lower planes]] to the Living City. The number of planar interlopers in Ravens Bluff was swelling, and soon, chaos, property damage, and civilian deaths began threatening the city as another threat – war in the [[Vast]] against warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] continued ravaging the region.

As the strife continued, Lady-Lord Mayor [[Amber Lynn Thoden]] decided to assemble a group of adventurers to be sent into the [[Ravens Deep]] in search of the artifact said to be able to counter the darkness of the ''Heart of Bane''. It was called the ''[[Orb of Protection]]''. The Lord [[Charles Blacktree]] was to helm the expedition for the lost artifact, missing for over 750 years after the last great [[drow]] invasion of the Vast. The expedition of numerous descents began around a [[tenday]] before [[Eleasis 10]] of 1370 DR. The stakes were real. Not just the lives of the citizens of Ravens Bluff but also the dark deity [[Bane]]'s possible return.{{Cite living city/A Shot in the Dark, Part I|3-4}}

Meanwhile, the ''Heart of Bane'' continued endangering Ravens Bluff. In [[Uktar]]-[[Nightal]] of 1370 DR,{{LCRB}} two temples of the Bluff fell to the ''Heart's'' corruption. The news of the [[Temple of Lathander (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Lathander]] and the [[Temple of Mystra (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Mystra]] both falling to the corruption made headlines of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]],'' and the cause of chaos became public knowledge. The reporter from the ''Trumpeter'' named [[Nadd Parker]] interviewed a renowned sage, [[Carlisle]], on the subject of the corruption's source. The wisened man revealed that the ''Heart of Bane'' corrupted all through mere touch. The ''Orb of Protection'' of the ancient fallen [[Sarbreen]] that the city-sponsored adventurers were searching for could end the crisis by fully absorbing the ''Heart's'' magic. The same issue of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter'' publicly announced Lady-Lord Mayor Amber Thaden's sponsorship of expeditions in search of the ''Orb of Protection''.

The threat loomed over the city as the year 1370 DR ended. The editorial staff of the ''Trumpeter'' and [[Fred Faber]] looked with hope into the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. The search for the ''Orb of Protection'' continued as the ''Heart of Bane'' continued to attract clerics of Bane, [[Cyric]] and [[Iyachtu Xvim]] to Ravens Bluff, adding to the tumult of the city, on top of the on-going war against Myrkyssa Jelan, despite her unsuccessful attack on the Bluff. Desperate for another solution, the Mayor ordered the [[Wizards Guild]] to find an alternative to the seemingly unending search for the long-lost artifact.{{Cite trumpeter/2-1|1}} In the [[Tarsakh]] issues of ''Ravens Bluff Trumpeter,'' the broadsheet reported on the recent kidnapping of Mayor Thoden during the winter festival. Banites held the Mayor hostage and had her replaced with a [[doppelganger]], eventually demanding the ''Heart of Bane'' in exchange for the Mayor's life. But the plot was foiled thanks to the efforts of several adventurers of the Living City.{{Cite trumpeter/2-4|6}} By [[Kythorn]], ''Heart of Bane's'' corruption spread on the city's livestock. Animals were born deformed and twisted by Bane's foul magic. Secretly, fields created a magical device that, if not stopped, would allow the [[Abyss]] to swallow Ravens Bluff, delivering the ''Heart of Bane'' to the tanar'ri.{{Cite trumpeter/2-6|4}} Meanwhile, demons and devils continued appearing the Ravens Bluff, turning the city into periodically flaring localized [[Blood War]]s.{{Cite trumpeter/2-6|5}} The same month, nearby volcano, [[Firestorm Mountain]] erupted. Some blamed the volcano's activity on the ''Heart of Bane''.{{Cite trumpeter/2-6s|2}}

In [[Eleasis]] of 1371 DR, the town of [[Mossbridges]] fell under an assault from hellish creatures. It was later revealed that [[Lord Lorien]] took the ''Heart of Bane'' for study – the action that provoked the deadly attack.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}

However, by [[Marpenoth]] of 1371 DR, no solution to any of the crises was found, and tanar'ri attacks were only getting worse across the Vast. Attracted to the radiating evil of the ''Heart of Bane'', [[fiend]]s had already raised several villages, including the settlement called [[Big Moe]].{{Cite trumpeter/2-10|1}} The following month, a bewildering thing happened. The [[Bard's Guild]] of Ravens Bluff plastered the city with posters that advertised that the "Heart of Bane" would be making an appearance at a performance. The aforementioned "Heart of Bane" was not the infamous relic but rather a new [[bard]]ic troupe that stupidly decided to adopt the name for publicity. The band consisted of [[Firmal]] playing [[illithid bagpipes]], [[Havoc Sen Thornclaw]] with the ''[[ax of deafening and destruction]]'', [[Vanduhar Gerenstalt Eisner]] playing the ''[[Illmataran organ of pain]]'', [[Everett Taber]] and his ''[[drums of panic]]'', and lastly, [[Nassar]] – the lead wailer...err...singer. Unsurprisingly, the advertisement brought a band of tanar'ri, led by a [[marilith]], to the performance. The ensuing slaughter ended the lives of a dozen innocents, and the  Bard's Guild was lit aflame, severely damaging the building.{{Cite trumpeter/2-11|2}}

As of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the ''Heart of Bane'' remained at large. Dame [[Irwina Austentell]] of Ravens Bluff was abducted by a mysterious lower planar creature that demanded the ''Heart'' in exchange for the woman's life.{{Cite trumpeter/3-1|2}}
