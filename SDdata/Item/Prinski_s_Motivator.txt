'''''Prinski's Motivator''''', or simply '''''Motivator''''', was a magical device that worked with a set of attuned ''[[incineration collar]]s'', used by the [[cultists of Bane]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Prinski's Motivator is the supreme Banite means of ultimate coercion, but it is useful solely as a deterrent and not as a weapon. When triggered, the user has only moments to deactivate it before the prison tank charges detonate and the hostages are killed - taking with it our leverage over the Gondian artificers. Threaten convincingly, but never go to full detonation unless the entire Foundry falls to our enemies!''|Excerpt from Banite kill switch protocol,}}

==Description==
''Prinski's Motivator'' was a device resembling a sharp-edged purse crystal encased in a chassis of gold. The crystal floated and glowed when activated.

==Powers==
Each ''Motivator'' was connected to a collection of ''incineration collars'' nearby; once activated, they could instantly kill all the collared persons. If the Black Gauntlet dropped the device, it would automatically activate with some delay, killing every shackled slave around it. If ''Prinski's Motivator'' was handled by someone unaware of its inner workings, it had a chance of detonating itself, along with the nearby ''incineration collars''.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''Motivators'' and ''incineration collars'' were used by the Black Gauntlets of [[Bane]] under the leadership of Lord [[Enver Gortash]] to "motivate" [[Gondian]] workers of the [[Steel Watch Foundry]] to produce [[steel watcher]]s around the clock. Followers of Bane, the god of tyranny, insisted that enslaved Gondians remained aware of what they were forced to do and suffered from knowing what they'd done.
