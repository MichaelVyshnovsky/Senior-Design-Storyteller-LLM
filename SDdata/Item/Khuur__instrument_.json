        "mainbody": "The khuur was a stringed musical instrument used by the nomads of the vast steppes of the Hordelands.\nA typical khuur was made from wood with horsehide stretched tightly over the front. Two strings were fitted from the long neck to the base of the instrument and played with a bow. The khuur was usually played while sitting cross-legged.\nThe musicians of the steppes, called kaychi, believed each instrument carried its own spirit, prompting them to make offerings in their honor. Because of this all khuur were handled with care and treated with honor."
