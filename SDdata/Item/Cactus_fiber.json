Cactus fiber was pressed into a crude type of fabric and thinner parchment-like material. In the land of Payit, rolled sheets of cactus fiber were used for writing messages to be carried between the cities of Ulatos and Tulom-Itzi.\nPlumaweavers of Maztica used cotton and cactus fiber for weaving of their pluma magic."
