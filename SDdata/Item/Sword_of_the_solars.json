        "mainbody": "Swords of the solars were exotic enchanted bastard swords wielded by solars of the Celestial planes.\nThese huge grand swords were enchanted to be used by the strongest of the angels, solars. Their fearsome might and a +5 enchantment could cleave almost any enemy with one strike, somewhat akin to the vorpal magical quality. These swords also burnt as bright as the brightest torch, emitting white light  around them.\nLong before 1374 DR, one of these swords was sealed underneath a chasm-ridden plain in Thar, not far from the swamps of Iyrauroth, the Wyrm of the Peaks. Of course, the sword was wielded by its owner at the time. She was the unnamed fallen solar who was the reason for the chasms that scarred the land around her magical prison."
