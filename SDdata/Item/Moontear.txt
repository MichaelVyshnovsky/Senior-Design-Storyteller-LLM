The '''''Moontear''''' was a [[artifact|relic]] associated with the [[elf|elven]] [[deity]] [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. In the 1490s DR, it was sought after by the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]], an adventuring company.

==Description==
The ''Moontear'' had the appearance of a crystal rock.

==Powers==
The relic was said to possess a fraction of Sehanine's divine essence, granting its owner the ability to heal injuries, cure madness, and resurrect the dead.

==History==
According to legend, Sehanine Moonbow shed a single tear for the gods who fell during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]]. Unbeknown to most, the relic was secreted away in an elven village, where it remained hidden until it was stolen in a [[drow]] raid. All the while, ambitious individuals both good and evil searched for the ''Moontear'', hoping to use the relic to further their ends.

In the 1390s DR, the brothers [[Gareth Dawntreader|Gareth]] and [[Roth Dawntreader]] founded the Order of the Burning Dawn, in the hopes of tracking down the ''Moontear'' and using its power to combat the spread of evil.

In the 1490s DR, the [[demon]] [[Belaphoss]] attempted to corrupt the ''Moontear'' and use it to ascend to godhood.
