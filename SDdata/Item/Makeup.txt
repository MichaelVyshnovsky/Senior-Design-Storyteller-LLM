Makeup was a term used for a wide variety of materials and substances, including powders and oils, that were applied to faces, usually for the purpose of coloring and beautifying them. Those who were skilled in applying makeup to the face of others were referred to as "makeup artists".
Makeup was widely varied in form and application. Some substances, such as coal dust and tar, were used to blacken facial features, add dramatic lines, or to better conceal themselves in darkness. Conversely, some substances were used for the purposes of lightening features, such as flour. Some were used to add color, such as the cochineal powder of Maztica, which used to redden lips and cheeks. Makeup could also include skin putty, which was used to add circles beneath ones eyes or make their nose appear longer, and oil to add a sheen of gloss to ones skin.
