Spoons were a kind of utensil used in cooking and eating, widely appreciated for their scooping and stirring qualities.
The average spoon was used in kitchens and dining rooms for preparing and eating food, alongside forks and knives. They were also a standard part of mess kits used by travelers. Their most important feature was the bowl-like protuberance that allowed them to scoop up liquid foods like soup and porridge. Cheap dining spoons were commonly made from brass, while fancier ones were crafted from silver. Spoons used in cooking were often made of wood. 
Spades and shovels were essentially massive spoons used for farming, mining, and other labor-intensive work. Ladles were more modest, resembling oversized spoons used to prepare and serve food.
