        "mainbody": "message plate was a magic item that could be used to send a message.\nOne message plate resembled a gold-hued disc, wide enough to rest on ones hand, with studs around the side. A glowing, colorless, animated image of the one who sent the message was projected above it. It made a plink sound when deactivated. \nAnother was a silver plate with a mirrored inner part and runes running around the border. The recipient could touch certain runes to prove their identity and activate it. It played only a voice message.\nIn the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, the wizard Parwyyd Hanifar sent a message plate with a false image of Priam Agrivar to lure Kyriani Agrivar to the site of the Great Door on the outskirts of Waterdeep. Kyriani believed it had been sent by Priam.\nIn the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Court Magician Vangerdahast posed as the poisoned King Azoun IV when he placed a voice message on a message plate intended for Princess Alusair Obarskyr. He had Laspeera Inthré deliver the message plate to Alusair.\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nlrbd7j07f7rivv9acykhv1now977xv9"
