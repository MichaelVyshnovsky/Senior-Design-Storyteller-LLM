'''''Safiya's robes''''' were a set of unique [[Red Wizard]] [[robe]]s, [[enchanted]] and worn by [[Safiya]], a companion of [[Kalach-Cha]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Safiya's robes'' were bright red, proudly announcing her affiliation with the Red Wizards of [[Thay]]. The garb had ''+3'' protection enchantment weaved into it, as well as magics that provided improved universal protections from magical and physical effects and hazards. ''Safiya's robes'' also dramatically improved the wearer's skills to concentrate. Because of its enchantments, the robe could only be worn by [[human]] Red Wizards and none other.

==History==
Safiya appeared wearing her magic Red Wizard robes in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, when she found the western hero Kalach-Cha deep within [[The Bear God's Barrow]] in [[Rashemen]]. She continued wearing the robes while traveling with the new companion, however, Safiya insisted on changing out of the red garb when entering [[Mulsantir]] and other Rashemi settlements due to the tense relationship between the Red Wizard and the inhabitants of the land of [[witch]]es and [[berserker]]s.
