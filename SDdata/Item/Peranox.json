        "mainbody": "Peranox was a deadly contact poison that originated from the south Faer√ªn and commonly used by members of the Fire Knives.\nPeranox had a distinct potent cinnamon smell. It was usually kept in small vials sealed with wax.\nIn 1357 DR,  the Fire Knives attacked Alias while trying to bring her in alive. Afterward, vials of peranox were looted from their bodies, giving her an important clue about the assassins true intent. The same bottles later found their way into halfling bard Olive Ruskettles pockets and gave her an important upper hand in negotiating with the famous red dragon Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco. Olive threatened to drink the cinnamon-smelling poison before the dragon was to eat her, which would kill the dragon as a result. Eventually, Olive threw the poison bottle into Mists maw, almost killing the dragon. But Mists life was saved by a saurial paladin Dragonbaits healing.\n* The Fire Knives used peranox to coat their blades with.\n* Alias of Westgate recovered two bottles of peranox from the bodies of assassins that were sent after her.\n* Olive Ruskettle eventually came to use one of Alias bottles against Mist, a red dragon."
