'''"The Prophet"''' was a painting found in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was considered "newer" by [[1479 DR]].

==Description==
It was a portrait of a female [[elf]] garbed in black with a purple [[sash]], with a mechanical [[owl]] perched on her arm. The title "The Prophet" was etched into the frame. The subject did not appear particularly prescient.

==History==
"The Prophet" was found in the [[Merchant Guild Hall]] in the [[Neverwinter/River District]]{{NWDistricts}} of Neverwinter in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, presumably having been left behind by the guild merchants or looted by the [[Many-Arrows]] [[orc]]s who occupied the district and turned the hall into a fortress. Although the orcs burned, smashed, or defiled all the artworks within, "The Prophet" survived curiously intact and left propped against some crates.
