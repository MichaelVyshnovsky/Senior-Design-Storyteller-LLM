        "mainbody": "The dominion rod was the control mechanism for the hollow of dominion, a massive artifact that could exert psychic control and madness over the southern Sword Coast North.\nIt was a crystal rod that sat in an indentation located at the center of the hollow of dominion. While it was quite sturdy, it could be destroyed through mundane means.\nEven if a creature was attuned to the hollow of dominion, they were not able to use its power unless the dominion rod was secured in its position. Removal or destruction of the dominion rod rendered the hollow of dominion completely inert.\nIf a creature other than the attuned wielder were to touch the dominion rod, this would temporarily join their mind to that of the wielder. When this happened, the two could engage in a battle of wills to inflict mental injuries on each other.\n* Gavmogon, a mindwitness who sought to use the hollow to kill or control everything near Phandalin to prove his superiority. He was highly protective of the dominion rod."
