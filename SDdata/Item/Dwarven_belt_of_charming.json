        "Powers": "Contrary to its name, or perhaps, ironically named, ''dwarven belts of charming'' did not enhance the wearer's charm and appeal. Instead, it plummeted their charisma below even dwarven low standards.",
        "History": "Several of the ''dwarven belts of charming'' were commissioned by [[Kurgin Stonehand]], following the clan's glorious defeat of [[Zarkursk]], an old and evil [[black dragon]] who resided in the swamps not far from the Clan Stonehand's mines. The proud warriors plundered the dead dragon's horde, a pile of [[gem]]s and precious stones worth a fortune. Many of the young warriors of the tribe suddenly became highly sought-after bachelors among the neighboring dwarven clans. One such clan was [[Clan Licehair]], whose females started hounding the Clan Stonehand's youth, seeking to woo them. Kurgin thought the sudden popularity to be an unwelcome nuisance and handed out these enchanted belts to the single men of the clan, scaring the \"gold diggers\" away.\n\nIn 1372 DR, one of these belts could be found among junk and antiques of [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]]."
