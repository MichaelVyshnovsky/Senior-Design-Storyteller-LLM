        "alignment": "[[Lawful Good]]Per Kiril Duskmourn, Nangulis had been \"saintly\", and was even more so after death. That word is often associated with the lawful good alignment, and the sword's tendency to become more aggressive against creatures aligned with chaos or evil seems to reinforce that conclusion. Furthermore, Bruce R. Cordell has confirmed in ''Candlekeep'' posts that the weapon's personality is supposed to bring to mind an excess of moral certainty. Per Gage in p. 50 of ''Stardeep'', he expected the sword to be \"good-aligned\"; p. 66 states it kept to a compact with him, in spite of everything, and both Kiril and Raidon expect the weapon to attack \"wastrels\", \"miscreants\" and \"scofflaws\" on sight, implying that its enmity extends to those who ignore a law. Its attack of the youths who were in violation of the Compact of Yuireshanyaar is considered proof positive of this. The sword is, furthermore, more than once stated to contain all that was pure, noble and good in Nangulis' soul. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that ''Angul'' is Lawful Good.",
        "mainbody": "'''''Angul''''' was a [[longsword]] made from a soul shard of [[Nangulis]], a [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]], around the year {{yearlink|1364}}. The intelligent weapon bore an overwhelming force of personality that threatened to subsume the will of most who attempted to wield it.\n\n{{quote|We do not suffer abominations!|The blade ''Angul''}}",
        "Appearance": "''Angul'' bore an inlay that read \"Keeper of the Cerulean Sign\" in [[star elf]] script. Kiril carried it in a white leather sheath as of 1374 DR.{{cite book/Darkvision|80|8}} There were runes on the blade, which glowed with white light when unsheathed. The hilt was wrapped in leather as of 1375 DR.\n\nThe sword sometimes groaned or howled an atonal sound in presence of aberrations.",
        "Powers": "The sword, even when not wielded, could cover itself with flickering fire that glowed blue, if it wanted to be noticed. More than that, if touched by something of a demonic nature, it could strike back with a backlash strong enough to destroy some demons.{{cite book/Stardeep|46}} ''Angul'' could use this power to punish its wielder, if it desired, too. It sometimes attempted to strike in its vicinity with this flame. The flame could also be used to evaporate dangerous fluids that covered the wielder.\n\n''Angul'' bore a very intense glow, like daylight, when unsheathed and wielded. It had no problem damaging incorporeal foes such as some [[undead]], and it could heal its wielder or help them power through pain as it desired, even inflicting pain sometimes.{{cite book/Darkvision|296|30}}{{cite book/Darkvision|262-265|27}} or grant strength. The weapon's light could hold some forms of darkness at bay, at least for a time.\n\nThose who wielded the blade had their doubts and hesitation burned to nothing in the blade's conviction,{{cite book/Darkvision|71|8}}\n\nIn a pinch, ''Angul'' could be thrown.{{cite book/Stardeep|67-72|8}}{{cite book/Stardeep|228|20}} When joined to the Cerulean Sign and wielded competently, ''Angul'' was used to scribe a Sign of Sealing that was expected to slay even the Eldest. In a similar situation, the sword was employed to seal anew the [[Far Manifold]], though this was its final task.\n\nLastly, it was wreathed in flames while attacking. Those were capable of reducing someone to bones in a blaze, or prevent trolls from regenerating.",
        "Personality": "Per Kiril Duskmourn, ''Angul'' was even more unbending in his saintliness as a sword than Nangulis had been.{{cite book/Darkvision|33-34|4}} The sword was made of the fractions of Nangulis' soul that aligned with purity, self-sacrifice, a higher ideal, and duty;{{cite book/Stardeep|281|27}} all of the righteousness, justice, and goodliness of his soul became a part of ''Angul'', and she found the weapon itself to have been especially effective at controlling her precisely by being similar to Nangulis. Kiril even insisted ''Angul'' was male.\n\nThe weapon acted with unyielding, holy conviction, and actively quelled its wielders' ability to consider consequences both to themselves and to others.{{cite book/Darkvision|140|14}}{{cite book/Darkvision|302|30}} It did not take notice of ignorance, in fact, it did not take notice of just about any circumstance or emotion other than to disregard it.{{cite book/Stardeep|113-114|10}}\n\nThe weapon was jealous, and it did not like wielder employing any other magical weapon, though it did not retaliate for that.{{cite book/Darkvision|210-211|22}} It was not above injuring a recalcitrant wielder, sabotaging them in battle{{cite book/City of Torment|121|11}} or causing them to come to injury as punishment, but it honored deals brokered with it.{{cite book/Stardeep|170-172|16}} At all times, it wanted to be in control.{{cite book/City of Torment|14-15|2}}\n\nIt gladly struck down [[demon]]s,{{cite book/City of Torment|239|21}}\n\nFor a few minutes in 1396 DR, ''Angul'' was showing signs of sorrow, remorse, and self-awareness, bemoaning Kiril's abandonment, and blaming its own lack of restraint for it. That lasted only until Raidon Kane asked for its help in cleansing abominations.{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|264-265|19}} However, after that point, ''Angul'' began to show some changes, actually providing warnings and reasoning with its wielder rather than simply taking them over,{{cite book/City of Torment|250-253|22}} and recognizing that accomplishing the latter might not be sufficient for its appointed tasks, going so far as to take its wielder's emotional state into account.{{cite book/City of Torment|268-273|24}} This could possibly have been because ''Angul'' felt its final battle was approaching.",
        "History": {
            "Creation (ca. 1364 DR)": "The weapon was created around the year {{yearlink|1364}}, during an escape attempt by [[the Traitor]] in [[Stardeep]]. Unable to stop the traitor at their present strength, both keepers, Nangulis and Kiril, as well as [[Cynosure (construct)|Cynosure]], the constructed intelligence that oversaw the fortress, required a stronger weapon. The crafting method they selected at the moment required the sacrifice of an ensouled being in order to complete the weapon, which would be imbued with the parts of their soul that were aligned with goodness and duty; almost out of time, the [[Keeper of the Cerulean Sign]] [[Nangulis]] was chosen as the sacrifice. The weapon was in turn wielded by Nangulis' fiancee, [[Kiril Duskmourn]], who, wielding it, managed to weaken and subdue the Traitor, then return him to his prison.",
            "Kiril Duskmourn (ca. 1364-ca. 1386 DR)": "Kiril kept the weapon afterwards. Its influence eventually drove her to slay a number of young [[elves]] who had become too curious about the gates of Stardeep in violation of the [[Compact of Yuireshanyaar]]. After she realized what she did under its influence, she fled Stardeep, and became a brigand.{{cite book/Darkvision|76-80|8}}{{cite book/Darkvision|135-137|14}} even where other weapons without an ego of their own were available, as the situation was dire enough to render half-measures unworkable.{{cite book/Darkvision|262-264|27}}{{cite book/Darkvision|282-283|29}}\n\nAfter Pandorym was sealed anew, she resolved to return to Stardeep. While lingering at Laothkund, her weapon was stolen by the [[Shadow Tongue]] crime ring. It was retrieved from the lair by her friend [[Gage]]; he too was forced to resort to ''Angul'' during his escape from the Shadow Tongue lair, despite it destroying one of his enchanted gloves, the ''[[Hands of Paymon]]''. He too became overwhelmed by the weapon.{{cite book/Stardeep|48-54|5}} Kiril relieved him of the weapon at the [[Laothkund#Green Warrior Inn and Tavern|Green Warrior Inn and Tavern]], relating to him afterwards the story of ''Angul''.\n\nKiril continued her path to Stardeep afterwards, accompanied by Gage. The weapon slew [[Sathra]] of the Shadow Tongue along the way.{{cite book/Stardeep|118-119|10}} Once she arrived at Stardeep, Kiril had to defend herself from the [[Empyrean Knights]], who wanted to take away her weapon; the sword itself chose not to help.{{cite book/Stardeep|147-149|12}} After the fight, Kiril parted ways with the thief, and was joined by two others, [[Raidon Kane]] and [[Adrik Commorand]] on a quest for a hidden path to Stardeep: ''Angul'' slew [[nilshai]] in [[SildÃ«yuir]], where the hidden path lay.{{cite book/Stardeep|219-220|20}} The weapon then accompanied her into the [[Underdungeon]], where the sword smote down [[revived fossil]]s until Kiril's courage failed her,{{cite book/Stardeep|253-254|23}} and then helped Keeper Telarian, who was armed with its twin sword,{{cite book/Stardeep|258|23}} slay the [[relic lich]].{{cite book/Stardeep|262-265|25}} Kiril bore the sword and joined Telarian's party as it returned to Stardeep. When Telarian, whom the sword saw as still keeping faith with the Cerulean Sign, attempted to slay Kiril, she blocked the strike with ''Angul''; on contact, ''Nis'' absorbed it, merging both weapons into ''''Angul''-Nis''.{{cite book/Stardeep|284-285|27}}\n\nAs ''Angul''-Nis, the weapon became Telarian's to wield. Within moments, he used it to strike down Keeper [[Delphe]] and sunder her [[Cerulean Sign]], smash Kiril's pet dragonet [[Xet]],{{cite book/Stardeep|288-289|28}} destroy Cynosure's body, and break the wards keeping the Traitor imprisoned.{{cite book/Stardeep|298-302|28}} At the same time, the reconstructed soul of Nangulis, whose halves had been used to create the twin swords, reached out to Kiril Duskmourn. After learning Telarian was actually trying to release the Traitor, the full soul attempted to part itself and the sword back into its component parts.{{cite book/Stardeep|296-298|28}} It did not succeed, however, until the thief Gage made his appearance again, and struck Telarian from behind, breaking his concentration. ''Angul''-Nis was once more split into two halves; ''Angul'' landed on the ground of the Chamber of Observation, while ''Nis'' was lost in the Traitor's prison.\n\nThe newly sundered ''Angul'' almost allowed its half of Nangulis' soul to move on to the afterlife, but at the last moment, Kiril took the weapon, thus binding the half-soul to continue on.{{cite book/Stardeep|311|29}}",
            "Raidon Kane (1396 DR)": "Kiril kept the new ''Angul'' until one point after the [[Spellplague]], when she traded it away to the [[Chalk Destrier]] at the [[Plaguewrought Lands]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]] in exchange for passage to [[Returned Abeir]].{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|250-251|18}} It remained there until it was retrieved by Raidon Kane and Cynosure in [[1396 DR]].{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|254-255|18}} Though the weapon was at first intent on abandoning its own existence, Raidon managed to reawaken its lust for destruction.{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|263-266|19}} At the island, ''Angul'' battled several [[kuo-toa]] and a dragon, [[Scathrys]], before its wielder decided to go straight for Gethshemeth.{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|297-301|22}}\n\nBefore ''Angul'' could sunder that artifact, it was stolen by the warlock [[Japheth Donard]] who used it to teleport away.{{cite book/Plague of Spells/MMP|303|22}} Some tendays later, Raidon caught up to Japheth, and attempted to run him through with the weapon; Japheth managed to escape at the last minute again.{{cite book/City of Torment|62|7}} Raidon made his next target the [[Eldest]] in [[Xxiphu]], an abomination he glimpsed in the ''Dreamheart'' just before Japheth took it.{{cite book/City of Torment|64-65|7}} Once in the underground city, ''Angul'' wounded the kraken Gethshemeth again,{{cite book/City of Torment|203-209|19}} slew a guardian [[aboleth]], and fought against the strange silver grass of the city.{{cite book/City of Torment|232-235|21}}\n\nUnfortunately for the sword, Raidon became disabled when the Eldest employed phantom children to attack his mind, which was still reeling from the loss of his daughter; disturbed almost to the point of catatonia,{{cite book/City of Torment|250-253|22}} ''Angul'' took full control of Raidon's body and slew the phantoms. Wielding Raidon Kane, ''Angul'' proceeded along the way to the top of the city of Xxiphu, where aboleth were attempting a ritual to awaken the Eldest. The sheer number of aboleths in the area forced it, however, to attempt to empathize with Raidon Kane, so as to be able to call on the power of his sign.{{cite book/City of Torment|265-269|24}} ''Angul'' eventually managed to rouse Raidon from his hopelessness;{{cite book/City of Torment|270-275|24}} with his power and that of the Sign, the weapon managed to destroy scores of aboleths and scribe a sign of Sealing that completely thwarted the ritual. Unfortunately, the sign's power fell short of actually killing the antediluvian horror,{{cite book/City of Torment|283-286, 289-290|25}} perhaps due to Japheth's meddling again.{{cite book/City of Torment|297|26}}\n\n''Angul'' found itself rebuffed by its wielder briefly during the latter's subsequent bout of heavy drinking,{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||2}} until the home of Anusha Marhana, his host, was attacked by [[Neifion]], who was after Japheth. Using the blade, Raidon managed to fight off Neifion, but ''Angul'' was prevented from slaying Japheth by [[Yeva]], whom he had previously rescued from Xxiphu.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||4}} Raidon later agreed to accompany Japheth to the [[Yuirwood]], looking for Stardeep. After the two crossed a portal to the [[Feywild]] to reach Stardeep's ruins, ''Angul'' helped slay an abomination summoned by the [[eladrin noble]] [[Malyanna]], a student of the Traitor, to cover her escape.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||12}} They were later attacked by Neifion again; ''Angul'''s offers of aid were rebuffed again for that fight.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||14}} Raidon and Japheth later joined the Feywild forces from the Watch on [[Forever's Edge]] that rushed out to do battle with [[Malyanna]] and [[Xxiphu]] at the [[Citadel of the Outer Void]]; on their march acros the void, ''Angul'' was essential to battling the abominations that tried to stop them.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||18}} At the Citadel of the Outer Void, Raidon drew ''Angul'',{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||20}} but then eschewed the weapon when it came to fighting [[Taal]].{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||21}} He later wielded it against more abominations, and finally Malyanna herself, though it turned out to be of limited use: Malyanna was only defeated when Taal, spurred on by Raidon, finally turned against her, well after she managed to unlock the ''Far Manifold''.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||24}}",
            "Destruction (1396-1475 DR)": "After the battle at the [[Citadel of the Outer Void]], [[Anusha Marhana]] pointed out that Raidon's spellscar was a Cerulean Sign, and thus could be used to seal anew the [[Far Manifold]]. Raidon agreed to do it, sacrificing himself, as he was one with the sign; he considered relinquishing ''Angul'', but the weapon explained this was to be its final task as well. Together, Raidon and ''Angul'' sealed the Far Manifold again, and were destroyed in the process.{{cite book/Key of Stars||25}}Though Raidon enters the Feywild in 1396, the Citadel of the Outer Void has very different flowing time. Given that all the events that led up to the happenings in the Citadel occur in 1396 DR and there is no further information as to the correspondence of events outside the Citadle, this article has chosen to ignore the exact year to which the sealing would correspond to and instead give the range of 1396 to 1475, the latter being the year in which the survivors of the trip returned to Toril. ''Angul'''s shell was laid to rest in [[Nathlekh]], on the {{yearlinkName|1475}}, atop the grave for Raidon's spent body.{{cite book/Key of Stars/MMP||27}}"
