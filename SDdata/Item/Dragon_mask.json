        "mainbody": "The '''''Dragon Masks''''' were a series of five [[mask (object)|masks]] associated with the \"Dragon Whisperers\" and the evil goddess of [[dragon]]s, [[Tiamat]].",
        "Description": "The five masks were crafted to resemble one of the five primary varieties of [[chromatic dragon]]s, those that corresponded with Tiamat's five heads. These included the [[White Dragon Mask|White]], [[Green Dragon Mask|Green]], [[Blue Dragon Mask|Blue]], [[Black Dragon Mask|Black]], and [[Red Dragon Mask]]s.",
        "Powers": "Each mask conferred upon its wearer a variety of magical powers, several of which involved an element associated with each of the five types of chromatic dragons. They granted protection from their given element, the ability to understand and speak the [[Draconic language]], [[darkvision]] up to a range of {{SI|60|ft}}, and reduced harm made upon them by physical attacks.\n\nAdditionally, each of the masks allowed the wearer to exert a limited form of influence over chromatic dragons.\n\nWhen two or more of the masks were brought together, they joined together as the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'', which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. Additional pieces of the five other ''dragon masks'' could later be added as well. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the [[ritual]] that could free Tiamat from the [[Nine Hells]].",
        "History": "In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the [[Cult of the Dragon]] began searching for the five ''Dragon Masks'' across the Realms. Their search spanned the breadth of [[Faer√ªn]], from an expedition in [[Frozenfar]] led by their [[Red Wizard]] ally [[Rath Modar]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 1}} to another in the [[Moonsea]] led by the \"cult traditionalist\" [[wizard]] named [[Ixas]].{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|5}} \n\nThe cult's leader [[Severin Silrajin]] recovered the ''[[Red Dragon Mask]]'' himself of the isle of [[Tuern]],{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 5}} while the ''[[White Dragon Mask]]'' was recovered, and subsequently lost to a devious [[Zhentarim]] [[Ratshadow|agent]] a short time later.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 6}} \n\nThe ''[[Green Dragon Mask|Green]]'' and ''[[Black Dragon Mask]]s'' and were found and stashed away at the [[Misty Forest]] and [[Skyreach Castle]] respectively. The former was secreted away to the cult's citadel at the [[Well of Dragons]] for use in their dark ritual, while the fate of the latter remained unknown for a time.\n\nEventually, all five of the masks were brought to the Well of Dragon, and Severin Silrajin assembled the complete ''Mask of the Dragon Queen''.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 8}} Unfortunately the cult's actions attracted the attention of the most powerful factions of the [[Sword Coast]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} Severin completed his ritual to summon his goddess [[Tiamat]] to the Realms, but the cult's success was brief. Tiamat was defeated and cast back down to the [[Nine Hells]], Severin was apprehended for his crimes, and the cult's forces were scattered.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}",
