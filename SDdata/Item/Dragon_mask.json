        "mainbody": "he Dragon Masks were a series of five masks associated with the \"Dragon Whisperers\" and the evil goddess of dragons, Tiamat.\nThe five masks were crafted to resemble one of the five primary varieties of chromatic dragons, those that corresponded with Tiamats five heads. These included the White, Green, Blue, Black, and Red Dragon Masks.\nEach mask conferred upon its wearer a variety of magical powers, several of which involved an element associated with each of the five types of chromatic dragons. They granted protection from their given element, the ability to understand and speak the Draconic language, darkvision up to a range of , and reduced harm made upon them by physical attacks.\nAdditionally, each of the masks allowed the wearer to exert a limited form of influence over chromatic dragons.\nWhen two or more of the masks were brought together, they joined together as the Mask of the Dragon Queen, which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. Additional pieces of the five other dragon masks could later be added as well. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the ritual that could free Tiamat from the Nine Hells.\nIn the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon began searching for the five Dragon Masks across the Realms. Their search spanned the breadth of Faer√ªn, from an expedition in Frozenfar led by their Red Wizard ally Rath Modar, to another in the Moonsea led by the \"cult traditionalist\" wizard named Ixas. \nThe cults leader Severin Silrajin recovered the Red Dragon Mask himself of the isle of Tuern, while the White Dragon Mask was recovered, and subsequently lost to a devious Zhentarim agent a short time later. \nThe Green and Black Dragon Masks and were found and stashed away at the Misty Forest and Skyreach Castle respectively. The former was secreted away to the cults citadel at the Well of Dragons for use in their dark ritual, while the fate of the latter remained unknown for a time.\nEventually, all five of the masks were brought to the Well of Dragon, and Severin Silrajin assembled the complete Mask of the Dragon Queen. Unfortunately the cults actions attracted the attention of the most powerful factions of the Sword Coast. Severin completed his ritual to summon his goddess Tiamat to the Realms, but the cults success was brief. Tiamat was defeated and cast back down to the Nine Hells, Severin was apprehended for his crimes, and the cults forces were scattered.\n* Varramzord, wearer of the White Dragon Mask.\n* Halander Hardingdale, temporary owner of the White Dragon Mask.\n* Neronvain, wearer of the Green Dragon Mask.\n* Rezmir, wearer of the Black Dragon Mask.\n* Severin Silrajin, owner of the Red Dragon Mask."
