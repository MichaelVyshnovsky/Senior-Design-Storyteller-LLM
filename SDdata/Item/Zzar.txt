Zzar was a fortified sherry wine popular in Waterdeep.
Zzar had a fiery orange color and an almond scent and flavor. Many elves disdained it, considering it vulgar.
Zzar was produced at wineries such as the House of Good Spirits in Waterdeep.
It was also available from the Yawning Portal, where it was commonly ordered by Esvele Rosznar.
