        "mainbody": "A '''''gem of insight''''' was a [[magic item]] that made it easier for whoever carried it to understand things.",
        "Description": "These items were always [[jewel]]s worth at least 5,000 [[gp]] without the magical enchantment.",
        "Powers": "After being carried for two weeks, a ''gem of insight'' began making it easier for its carrier to understand things and boosted their memory. After possessing the gem for three months, the carrier would actually become more intelligent and wise. If an individual no longer carried the gem after that three month period, their intelligence would remain boosted, but their wisdom would revert back to normal. A ''gem of insight'' could only provide these benefits once per individual.\n\nA variant, directly belonging to [[Labelas Enoreth]], allowed a person to delve within their own psyche and explore it, possibly achieving therapeutic ends.",
        "History": "*A party of malevolent [[wizard]]s had been slain, leaving behind a ''gem of insight'' within the caverns around the duergar dwellings in the mines of [[Bloodstone]].\n*The [[Thelaeneum]] in [[Myth Drannor]] had a belt with such a ''gem'' lying yet unclaimed as of {{yearlink|1367}}.",
        "Known Users": "*The [[archlich]] [[Bandaerl]] hid one such ''gem'' was hidden in a chest's fake bottom within a temple of [[Dumathoin]], later a part of [[Undermountain]]\n*[[Shur]], a [[human]] [[mage]] and nature-lover, carried a ''gem of insight''.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|544|Shur}}\n*[[Nicknack]], an [[ettin]] [[druid]], had one too.{{Cite polyhedron/60/The New Rogues Gallery: Two Heads Are Better Than One}}\n*[[Vartan Hai Sylvar]] had used a variant ''gem of insight'' sourced from [[Labelas Enoreth]] to save [[Dwalimar Omen]] from an unknown disease.{{Cite dragon/247/Reunification (Body & Soul)}}\n*[[Omar Hazeem Al-Malik]], a [[mummy]], possessed one too.{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|49}}\n*[[Eulaos]], a priest of [[Cyric]], had a ''medallion of insight'' that functioned essentially the same way.{{Cite dungeon/61/To Save a Forest|49}}\n*King [[Ornoth I]] had been entombed with such a gem.{{Cite dungeon/73/Eye of Myrkul|49}}\n*The hoard of [[Ralas]] included another such gem.{{cite book/Draconomicon (1990)|103}}"
