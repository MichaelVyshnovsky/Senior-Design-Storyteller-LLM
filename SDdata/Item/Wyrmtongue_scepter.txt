A '''''wyrmtongue scepter''''' was an enchanted scepter from [[Cormanthor]] with a variety of powers.

==Description==
The silver rod was fluted and chased, with one end tapering into a stylized flame, and the other end topped with a fist-sized [[sapphire]]. A slender, realistically depicted dragon was carved into a curling form around the scepter's body, with two eyes made of [[emerald]] and [[amber]]. At the tip of its tail, it curled around an [[alestone]].

==Powers==
By touching the emerald eye at the same time as the sapphire, the scepter launched a ray of white light that dealt grievous damage to [[undead]], and to undead only. The ray traveled for {{SI|90|feet|long=yes}} and hung in the air for a minute; it was possible to direct it during this time, effectively using it to attack.

Touching the amber and the sapphire, the scepter fired off a different straight beam of light. Up to three of them could be fired off within a minute; those dealt electric damage when they struck.

Touching the alestone and the sapphire, the scepter launched a ''[[backlash field]]''. This power was available only twice daily.

The scepter could also be willed to float in place, staying there indefinitely.

==History==
Several dozen such scepters were made in [[Cormanthor]], wielded by [[Elven high mage]]s of the realm and their agents, often to deal with renegade wizards.

In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Elminster]] purchased a '''''wyrmtongue scepter''''' from [[Surgath Ilder]], a prospector who was experimenting with the device after retrieving it from an elven tomb.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|30-34|1}}

==Reputation==
As of {{yearlink|1367}}, one such scepter was said to be hidden within the Royal Palace of [[Suzail]].
