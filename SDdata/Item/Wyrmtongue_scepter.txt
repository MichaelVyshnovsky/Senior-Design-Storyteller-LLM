A wyrmtongue scepter was an enchanted scepter from Cormanthor with a variety of powers.
The silver rod was fluted and chased, with one end tapering into a stylized flame, and the other end topped with a fist-sized sapphire. A slender, realistically depicted dragon was carved into a curling form around the scepters body, with two eyes made of emerald and amber. At the tip of its tail, it curled around an alestone.
By touching the emerald eye at the same time as the sapphire, the scepter launched a ray of white light that dealt grievous damage to undead, and to undead only. The ray traveled for  and hung in the air for a minute it was possible to direct it during this time, effectively using it to attack.
Touching the amber and the sapphire, the scepter fired off a different straight beam of light. Up to three of them could be fired off within a minute those dealt electric damage when they struck.
Touching the alestone and the sapphire, the scepter launched a backlash field. This power was available only twice daily.
The scepter could also be willed to float in place, staying there indefinitely.
Several dozen such scepters were made in Cormanthor, wielded by Elven high mages of the realm and their agents, often to deal with renegade wizards.
In , Elminster purchased a wyrmtongue scepter from Surgath Ilder, a prospector who was experimenting with the device after retrieving it from an elven tomb.
As of , one such scepter was said to be hidden within the Royal Palace of Suzail.
