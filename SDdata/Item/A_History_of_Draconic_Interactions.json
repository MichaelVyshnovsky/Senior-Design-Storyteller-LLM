        "mainbody": "A History of Draconic Interactions was a book that compiled human knowledge about dragons. The book had very detailed facts about dragon society, including a section about the Xorvintaal.\nWhen the former blue dragon Clytemorrenestrix read the book, in 1479 DR, she said that most of the knowledge compiled in that book was not only inaccurate but also illogical from the perspective of dragons."
