        "mainbody": "Oil of animate dead was a potion that could be rubbed onto a corpse or bones to create either a zombie or a skeleton. The first creature that it saw was regarded as its master and it would obey commands as if it were under the influence of the spell animate dead. It could only be used on a medium-sized or smaller creature. A vial was worth around 1500 gold pieces."
