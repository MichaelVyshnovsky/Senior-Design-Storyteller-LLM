Bane wands were enchanted wands that held magic unleashed upon command.
Bane wands had   shafts of braided design. They were usually made using bone, ivory, or wood. The total number of charges varied from wand to wand.
Each of these items held several charges of the bane spell. The magics held within the wand could be discharged at will using a command word. Upon expenditure of a wands last charge, it disintegrated.
