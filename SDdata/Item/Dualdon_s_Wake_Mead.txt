'''Dualdon's Wake Mead''' was an alcoholic drink brewed in the [[Ten-Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

==Availability==
The libation was sold as early as the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, in the towns surrounding lake [[Maer Dualdon]]. The [[mead]] was also served at [[The Salty Dog]] tavern in [[Targos]] where it was one of the cheaper intoxicants available. Sold for four [[gold]] pieces at the bar by its portly proprietor [[Gohar]] who was happy to share the town's latest rumors with paying customers.
