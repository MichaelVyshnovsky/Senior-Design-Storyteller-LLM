Sharkskin armor was tougher than leather armor but similar in appearance. The sharp scales of the sharkskin remained attached to the outer surface of the armor and shark teeth were often embedded along the forearms, shoulder and legs. These could be used to break from rope bonds or to deal more damage in combat.\nSharkskin armor possessed increased protection against fire and acid damage. When it was worn by anyone apart from aquatic humanoids, it felt too tight and restrictive, enough to negatively affect their movement and dexterity.\nIt was first developed by aquatic elves who were members of small, evil, reclusive sects. However, most aquatic elves didnt actually wear sharkskin armor, owing to their strong dislike of sharks, and found the idea repulsive. A studded leather armor variation existed â€“ shark skin and coral armor.\nWereseals wore sharkskin armor and carried sharkskin shields.\nAs of the , these types of armor were rarely seen on any other creatures apart from sahuagin of the Sea of Moving Ice."
