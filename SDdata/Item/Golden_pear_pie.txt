'''Golden pear pies''' were sweet baked pastry dishes made with ripened [[pear]]s.

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, golden pear pies were served at the art show titled "Strange Tides: Self-Portraits from the Sword Coast," hosted by [[Lady Jannath]] in her [[Lower City]] estate, along with wild [[mushroom soup]], [[steak]] medallions with [[asparagus]], and best wine procured from the [[Baldur's Gate/Manorborn|Manorborn]] district of the [[Upper City]].
