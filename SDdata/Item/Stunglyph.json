        "mainbody": "A '''''stunglyph''''' was a powerful [[handglyph]] weapon favored by the [[Geomancer]]s of [[Kadar]] used to stun their enemies.",
        "History": "[[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] sages were unsure of the exact method used to create these wondrous handglyphs, but believed an ancient precursor to the ''[[create soundstaff]]'' spell was involved.",
        "Powers": "When activated a ''stunglyph'' discharged a wave of sonic force that blasted anything in its path with powerful magic. The cone of force measured {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in length and spread to a width of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. Anything caught in this area was hit with an effect similar to the ''[[power word, stun]]'' spell.\n\nMost ''stunglyphs'' had between 2â€”8 charges and could not be recharged.",
        "Description": "These items could be found in a variety of shapes and sizes."
