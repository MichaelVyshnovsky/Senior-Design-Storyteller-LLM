Cloaks of stars, or cloaks of the stars,
A series of four silver stars were found around the neck and front hem of a cloak of stars.
When one of the stars was touched while Thalantas name was spoken aloud, the star would release the stored spell it held and then vanish forever. There were only a few wise sages in all of Faer√ªn who knew who to identify the spells stored within each of the four stars, so most of the time the user could not predict the spell that was released when triggered. Once triggered, the knowledge of the spell entered the wearers mind with enough time for them to properly target the spell before its magic took effect. 
Three variations of these cloaks existed containing the following spells 
* teleport, item enchantment, spiritwrack, and limited wish
* anti-magic shell, repulsion, reverse gravity, and imprisonment
* death spell, legend lore, statue, and shape change
Another variant allowed the wearer remove six stars from the cloak per day, each then could be thrown as a powerful enchanted +5 dart. After being thrown, the stars disappeared but reappeared on the cloak the following day.
In the , a ranger named Merella wore a cloaks of the stars when she was defeated and possessed by the Shade Lord, who infested an ancient ruined temple dedicated to Amaunator with darkness. When the creature was slain, Merella passed away, leaving her magic cloak on her lifeless body.
