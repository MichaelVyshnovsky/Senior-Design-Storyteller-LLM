Night ale was an ale brewed in Voonlar specifically for the Swords Meet inn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This strong ale was very dark in color and thus the name. It was available by the tankard for 1 sp each. The cost of a room at the inn included a meal and all the ale one cared to drink. Visitors could also buy a meal and a bottomless tankard of ale for 8 sp.
