        "mainbody": "Umojas armor was a set of enchanted hide armor worn by a druid of Ubtao named Umoja circa 1374 DR.\nThis hide armor was a surprisingly tough garment made of a hide of some unknown jungle beast. Apart from giving its wearer protection from the elements, Umojas armor possessed a +1 enchantment. Due to its Ubtaoan origins, this armor could only be worn by a druid.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the armor belonged to Umojaâ€Ž of Chult. Guided by his deitys commands, Umoja traveled to the nation of Samarach where he was attempting to uncover a yuan-ti conspiracy."
