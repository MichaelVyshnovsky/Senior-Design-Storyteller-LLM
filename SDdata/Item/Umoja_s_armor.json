        "mainbody": "'''''Umoja's armor''''' was a set of [[enchanted]] [[hide armor]] worn by a [[druid]] of [[Ubtao]] named [[Umoja]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].",
        "Powers": "This hide armor was a surprisingly tough garment made of a hide of some unknown jungle beast. Apart from giving its wearer protection from the elements, ''Umoja's armor'' possessed a ''+1'' enchantment. Due to its [[Ubtaoan]] origins, this armor could only be worn by a druid.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the armor belonged to Umojaâ€Ž of [[Chult]]. Guided by his deity's commands, Umoja traveled to the nation of [[Samarach]] where he was attempting to uncover a [[yuan-ti]] conspiracy."
