        "Powers": "''Armor of command'' was imbued with a ''+3'' enchantment. The potent magic of these sets surrounded the wearer with an aura of influence and admiration, increasing their charisma and persuasiveness.",
        "History": "Throughout history, these sets of armor were highly sought after by accomplished and aspiring generals. One notable incident that involved an ''armor of command'' happened at the [[Battle of Moregrade]] when an unlucky sycophant was granted command of an army just because they wore this beautiful enchanted armor.\n\nThese armors became more common in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], found in several cities across the [[Sword Coast]], [[Neverwinter]]. One set of ''armor of command'' could be found in catacombs underneath [[Voonlar]] in the [[Moonsea]] region ''circa'' [[1373 DR]]."
