        "mainbody": "Alarics charm was a simple-looking enchanted necklace that belonged to one of the members of House Ammath in the days of ancient Myth Drannor.\nAlarics charm granted its wearer enhanced intelligence in exchange for the diminished constitution.\nAlarics charm itself dated all the way to re-Weeping War Myth Drannor. The owner of the magic necklace was buried in the tomb under Glim-Gardens while wearing the charm. Eventually, one of many creatures that scavenged through the ruins desecrated the tomb and took the necklace for themselves.\nIn 1369 DR, Alarics charm found its way into the possession of a dark naga that made a home in the tombs under the Ammath mansion. The charm, along with the gauntlets of ogre size, the boots of the tortoise was locked away in nagas treasure chests."
