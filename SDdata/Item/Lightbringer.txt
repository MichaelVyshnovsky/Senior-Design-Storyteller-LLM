'''''Lightbringer''''' was an enchanted [[mace]].

==Description==
The holy mace glowed with a great radiance, and was made of [[brass]]. The end of ''Lightbringer'' was shaped like that of a sun breaking out from the clouds.

==Powers==
''Lightbringer'', which shone like a [[torch]] when commanded, had a ''+1'' enchantment, and allowed the wielder to cause extra damage to [[undead]] beings.

==History==
Some time in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], the explorer [[Urmon]] noted in his journal that the magical mace was commissioned by [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]] from artisans of the [[Forge of Spells]]. However, it was lost when [[Uruth Ukrypt]] raided the area.

''Circa'' [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the mace, as well as ''[[Dragonguard]]'', was watched over by a [[spectator]] [[beholder]] that was conjured by the original [[wizard]]s that dwelt in the [[Wave Echo Cave]].
