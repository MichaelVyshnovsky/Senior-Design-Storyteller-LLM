Lightbringer was an enchanted mace.
The holy mace glowed with a great radiance, and was made of brass. The end of Lightbringer was shaped like that of a sun breaking out from the clouds.
Lightbringer, which shone like a torch when commanded, had a +1 enchantment, and allowed the wielder to cause extra damage to undead beings.
Some time in the 10 century DR, the explorer Urmon noted in his journal that the magical mace was commissioned by clerics of Lathander from artisans of the Forge of Spells. However, it was lost when Uruth Ukrypt raided the area.
Circa 1491 DR, the mace, as well as Dragonguard, was watched over by a spectator beholder that was conjured by the original wizards that dwelt in the Wave Echo Cave.
