A '''nekode'' ({{Pronounce|neh|koe|deh|refs=}}) was a weapon and climbing tool.

==Description==
The nekode, a versatile tool utilized by [[ninja]]s, served dual purposes. Consisting of a pair of straps or gloves with spikes embedded in the palms, its primary function was to aid in climbing by securing a stronger grip through jamming the spikes into cracks. Additionally, the nekode could be employed as a means to inflict minor damage by clawing at an opponent. While wearing the nekode, one could still utilize other items with ease.

Typically, they were worn only when necessary, as they readily identified the user as a [[ninja]]. Outside of [[Kara-Tur]], the nekode was a common weapon in the [[Underdark]].

==Notable Users==
===Classes===
* [[Sohei]] were known to utilize the nekode.
