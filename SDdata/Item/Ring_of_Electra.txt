The ring of Electra was a powerful enchanted ring that allowed the wearer to discharge lightning out of their fingers.
The ring of Electra was a small band of electrum.
This ring allowed the wearer to cast the lightning bolt spell at will. It possessed six charges.
In 1369 DR, the ring of Electra and its sister item, the wand of Electra, could be found in the Cult of the Dragon-controlled upper levels of Eleven Catacombs underneath Castle Cormanthor. Each of the enchanted items was placed in a chest on the opposite rooms of a small healing alcove. Each room was guarded by several skeleton lords who came to life and attacked anyone who was bold enough to steal elven treasures.
