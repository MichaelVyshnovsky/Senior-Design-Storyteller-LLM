A robe was a long garment that was usually made of cloth. Many spellcasters and scholars, such as wizards, wore robes that were enchanted with magical powers.
Robes usually started at shoulder height, and ended close to the ankles. New, standard robes cost around 1 gp, and weighed 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). Extremely rare and enchanted robes could cost several tens of thousands of gold pieces.
Zakharan robes were known as caftans while aba or jellaba were robes worn over them to protect from the elements, the latter being of heavier weight worn during cold nights.
Robes could be enchanted with a myriad of different powers, from protecting the owner, to seeing invisible beings.
