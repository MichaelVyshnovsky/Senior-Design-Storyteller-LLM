A '''robe''' was a long garment that was usually made of cloth. Many spellcasters and scholars, such as [[wizard]]s, wore robes that were enchanted with [[magic]]al powers.

==Description==
Robes usually started at shoulder height, and ended close to the ankles. New, standard robes cost around 1 [[gp]], and weighed 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). Extremely rare and enchanted robes could cost several tens of thousands of gold pieces.

[[Zakhara|Zakharan]] robes were known as [[Caftan|caftans]] while [[aba]] or [[jellaba]] were robes worn over them to protect from the elements, the latter being of heavier weight worn during cold nights.

==Powers==
Robes could be enchanted with a myriad of different powers, from protecting the owner,{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1715}} to seeing invisible beings.

==Notable Groups That Used Robes==
* The [[Masked Lord|Masked]] [[Lords of Waterdeep]] covered most of their body with robes, whilst their faces were covered with masks, to retain anonymity.
* The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] wore characteristic red robes, which were sometimes lined with black material.
