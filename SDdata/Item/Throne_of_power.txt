A throne of power was a magic item that granted a variety of magical powers to those worthy enough to sit upon it.
This item was a large chair constructed of wood and metal and adorned with 100 gems.
Only individuals possessing royal blood could safely sit upon a throne of power and access its powers. Anyone lacking royal blood ran the risk of being instantly transported to the deepest, darkest dungeon on Toril. If the subject was deemed worthy the throne would bestow upon them all of the necessary knowledge on how to access its powers. The throne could cast the following spells once per day as if it were a powerful archmage charm person, detect magic, detect evil, detect invisible, hold person, protection from evil, 10 radius, dimension door, and remove curse. The throne came with 500 charges and would disappear when all of the charges were spent, or after 1001 days. Each spell cast from the throne used a single charge. Those with royal blood did not use a charge when casting a spell from the throne.
The users leadership skills were boosted significantly whenever they were seated on the throne. The throne was impervious to physical damage unless one of its gems was pried loose, which would cause the throne to lose all of its magic. The throne could only be moved by the approved user via mental teleportation so long as the destination was well known to the user.
