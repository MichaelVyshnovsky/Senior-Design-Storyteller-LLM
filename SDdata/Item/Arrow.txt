Arrows were a type of projectile shot by bows. A normal arrow consisted of a wooden shaft with a metal arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Arrows could also be made from stone, bone, horn, and more exotic materials.
Some arrows were enchanted in some way so they could deal larger damage, dispel, blind or silence their target.
Projectiles launched from a crossbow were known as bolts, while ballistae launched similar, but much larger missiles.
