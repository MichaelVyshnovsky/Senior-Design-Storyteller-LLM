'''Arrows''' were a type of projectile shot by [[bow]]s. A normal arrow consisted of a wooden shaft with a metal arrowhead attached to the front end, with fletchings and a nock at the other. Arrows could also be made from stone, bone, horn, and more exotic materials.

Some arrows were enchanted in some way so they could deal larger damage, dispel, blind or silence their target.

Projectiles launched from a [[crossbow]] were known as [[bolt]]s, while [[ballista]]e launched similar, but much larger missiles.

==Varieties==
;[[Ekaa arrow]]: An [[Iulutiun]] hunting arrow carved from antler and bone.
;[[Flight arrow]]: A long, light arrow designed for distance.
;[[Bow and arrow set (play)|Play arrow]]: Arrows that were designed for children to play with. Rather than having an arrowhead meant to inflict grievous injury, these were affixed with [[bean bag]]s.
;[[Sea arrow]]: An arrow made by [[sea elves]] for underwater use.
;[[Sheaf arrow]]: A heavy arrow designed for maximum lethality at shorter ranges.
;[[Signal arrow]]: An arrow that emulated a bird's call when shot.
