The '''''Great Wolf's Mark''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Raika]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Silverhand awarded this piece of headgear to Raika to aid in her mission to inspire other warriors toward victory in the midst of battle.

==Powers==
While wearing this helmet, Raika's taunts and battle cries energized and inspired her allies, and in some cases, could bestow speed reminiscent of the ''[[haste]]'' spell onto one of her allies.

==Notable Owners==
* Raika, a [[half-orc]] [[barbarian]] for whom Silverhand also crafted the ''[[Great Wolf's Fury]]'', the ''[[maul of focused destruction]]'', and the ''[[seal of harmony]]''.
