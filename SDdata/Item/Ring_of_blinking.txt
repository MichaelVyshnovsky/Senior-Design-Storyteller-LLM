A '''''ring of blinking''''' or simply a '''''ring of blink''''', was a [[magic]] [[ring]] that allowed the user to ''[[blink]]'' around their current position.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1991}}

==Description==
These rings were usually inscribed with their own [[command word]]. Thus, it was possible that one could be activated by someone other than its wearer, provided they were within {{SI|10|ft}} of the ring.

==Powers==
''Rings of blinking'' were activated via command words, which when spoken, would activate the powers of the rings for six minutes. Once activated, the rings would allow the wearers to disappear and reappear within {{SI|10|ft}} of their original locations. They had an equal chance to teleport the wearers to any available location: forward, backward, left, right, and each direction directly between them. After their activation period, the rings would stop functioning for an hour.

==History==
During the [[Golden Age of Netheril]], the effect of these magic rings was usually used in the form of [[mantle]]s. In [[1350 DR]], a ''ring of blinking'' was stashed in the ruins of the [[Galena Mountains]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Bigby]], a [[wizard]] of [[Oerth]] created one such ring for his [[hound]] [[Bigboy]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
