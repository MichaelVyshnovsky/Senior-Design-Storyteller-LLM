        "mainbody": "he Breath of Petron was a powerful dragonborn artifact.\nThe Breath of Petron was a flute that looked like a root made of red stone, branching in at least six different directions into finer tubes.\nThe Breath of Petron granted those who played it the power to control elemental air, earth, and lightning. The artifact demanded a price for its use, however, turning the lungs of those who played it into crystal. \nThe Breath of Petron was a piece of the lungs of a primordial named Petron. This artifact was made by a slave dragonborn named Haizverad, who stole a small part of the remains of Petron collected by the dragon Versveshardinazar.\nAfter the Spellplague, the dragonborn survivors of Tymanchebar used the Breath of Petron to construct Djerad Thymar, by lifting and fusing the remains of the capital djerad of Tymanchebar, the ruins of the God-Tomb of Nanna-Sin, and rocks from the Smoking Mountains. Since then, the artifact was guarded by members of Clan Shestandeliath.\nThe Breath of Petron was used again, in Hammer 9 of 1487 DR, by Shestandeliath Geshthax in order to create an earth barrier to protect Djerad Thymar against the advancing Untherite led by Gilgeam."
