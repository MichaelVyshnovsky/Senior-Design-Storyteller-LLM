Balance in All Things were enchanted kama created to enforce the Balance and neutrality.
Balance in All Things was enchanted with a simple +2 enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielders hand towards the target. Additionally, the kama dealt additional damage when used on creatures and individuals who venerated law or thrived in chaos.
Unsurprisingly, Balance in All Things was once a tool used by peasants in the fields, later adapted to be used in battle because they were forbidden from wielding swords. By the late 14 century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands.
