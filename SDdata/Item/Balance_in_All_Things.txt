'''''Balance in All Things''''' were [[enchanted]] [[kama]] created to enforce [[the Balance]] and neutrality.

==Powers==
''Balance in All Things'' was enchanted with a simple ''+2'' enchantment that made its slashes harmful even to creatures unaffected by mundane weapons and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the kama dealt additional damage when used on creatures and individuals who venerated [[law]] or thrived in [[chaos]].

==History==
Unsurprisingly, ''Balance in All Things'' was once a tool used by peasants in the fields, later adapted to be used in battle because they were forbidden from wielding [[sword]]s. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands.
