        "mainbody": "(bag) (bean)\nA bag of beans was a rare magical item.\nThe bag looked like a regular small sack and was made from heavy cloth. \nThe bag contained dried beans, which looked like regular ordinary beans but they contained powerful magical properties. If a bean was dropped on the ground, it exploded in a brilliant fireball. \nThe owner of the bag had no way of knowing what power a bean held. But if a bean was planted, the magical properties were revealed. The magical effects of the beans ranged from minor to incredibly powerful. \nThe known magical properties of the beans are listed below\n* Spawn a treant, although there was a risk it would be evil.\n* Summon an aggressive bulette.\n* Create a patch of toadstool mushrooms.\n* Create a statue that resembled the individual who planted the bean. It was rooted in place but for a day it was animate, and was verbally aggressive towards the individual who planted the bean.\n* Create a tree bearing fruit. The fruit had the effect of various potions.\n* Create a large pyramid, which contained a mummy lord.\n* Sprout a patch of shriekers.\n* Create a campfire of blue flame that burned for a full day.\n* Summon a geyser of liquid. The liquid could be water, beer, juice, tea or even oil.\n* Sprout a gigantic beanstalk."
