        "Description": "The shield was fashioned from the shell of a [[turtle|blackback turtle]] that had apparently naturally formed the image of a skull and crossed bones on it.",
        "Powers": "''Jhalanrojir'' reputedly enabled its bearer to breathe in water, invoke fear in one's foes, and swim as swiftly as a sea turtle. This was mostly true—while it was a ''+3 shield'' that granted the power of water breathing for an hour each day, it actually allowed the wielder to transform into a blackback sea turtle with the shield on its back whilst immersed in saltwater.",
        "History": "Although the provenance of the ''Pirateshield'' was understandably patchy, its name strongly suggested an origin in Turmish. However, scholars had their doubts, as ''Jhalanrojir'' was first recorded somewhat earlier, in the 1160s [[DR]] if not before.\n\nCertainly, the Great Pirate was well known to have used ''Jhalanrojir'' through much of his career, until at least the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, when documents in [[Lyrabar]], [[Impiltur]], recorded Immurk owning it when he and exiled Crown Prince [[Talryn]] established the settlement on [[Dragonisle]].<ref><ref>\n\n''Jhalanrojir'' resurfaced in the {{YearlinkName|1206}}, in the possession of another feared pirate by the name of [[Black Anzil]]. Three more pirates would wield the ''Pirateshield'', but it was lost for good long before Black Aznil died in the {{YearlinkName|1218}}.\n\nUnknown to all, by the late 14{{th}} century DR, ''Jhalanrojir'' lay within a shipwreck situated approximately {{SI|60|mile|k|long=yes}} north-northwest of [[Alaghôn]], the capital of Turmish. It was {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} below sea level and buried beneath {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} of silt. The site was indicated by the few exposed ribs of the wreck's hull, which were encrusted with [[coral|claw coral]].",
        "Legacy": "Although unconfirmed, many believed the ''Pirateshield'' inspired the traditional flag of piracy, both the black-and-white skull and crossbones symbol and its name, the Jolly Roger, which was thought to be a corruption of ''Jhalanrojir''."
