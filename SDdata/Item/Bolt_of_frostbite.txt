'''''Bolts of frostbite''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[crossbow]] ammunition.

==Powers==
These magic [[bolt]]s were colt to the touch. Each shaft was imprinted with a short message: "Warning: A Touch of Frost." Upon contact with their targets, ''bolts of frostbite'' dealt a freezing cold damage, additional to piercing. A stronger variation of these bolts was imbued with a ''+1'' enchantment and transformed into a rolling ball of ice that numbered and freeze-burned their targets.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''bolts of frostbite'' were often used along the [[Sword Coast]] region, as well as the [[Moonsea]].
