        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of Myrkul''''' was a magical ring originally worn by a [[priest]] of [[Myrkul]].{{Cite dungeon/71/Dreadful Vestiges|58}}",
        "Description": "A ''ring of Myrkul'' was a relatively thick gold band painted black adorned with an image of a white flaming skull (the symbol of Myrkul).\n\nEvil, intelligent creatures who passed within 30 feet of a ''ring of Myrkul'' were drawn to it.",
        "Known Powers": "''Rings of Myrkul'' served as keys for priests of Myrkul to enter a temple of Myrkul safely. They also allowed the wearer the ability to walk among the [[undead]] without being attacked (unless the wearer attacked the undead). Additionally, the rings had a few offensive abilities, including casting the spells ''[[chill touch]]'' and ''[[ghoul touch]]''.\n\nBefore the [[Time of Troubles]] ([[1358 DR]]), the rings had greater [[necromancy|necromantic]] powers that could be invoked by Myrkulites, but after the Time of Troubles those powers disappeared.",
        "Hidden Powers": "During an astronomical event, known as \"[[Eye of Myrkul|the Eye of Myrkul]]\", when a new moon passed through a ring of stars associated with the symbol of [[Mystra]], the ''rings of Myrkul'' manifested the power to raise the [[Uthtower]] from the swamps of the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. Three such rings were required to be within five miles of the tower to raise it, and the rings were able to magically guide a wearer toward the tower if so desired.\n\nWhile within the Uthtower, a ring's other powers to affect the undead and cast necromantic spells were also enhanced.{{Cite dungeon/73/Eye of Myrkul}}",
        "History": "When Myrkul was killed in [[1358 DR]], his secret temple in the Mere of Dead Men in the [[Sword Coast North]] sank into the swamp. The priests escaped into the Mere but were killed, their rings falling into the possession of the beasts of the Mere.\n\nAround [[1370 DR]], the cleric [[Varak Redshield]] found a ''ring of Myrkul'' in the [[Holk House]] in the Mere of Dead Men. Several other rings have also been found in the Mere.",
