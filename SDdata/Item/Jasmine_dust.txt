Jasmine dust was an exotic powder made out of jasmine plants in Kara-Tur that was commonly used as a type of perfume.
Jasmine dust was a pleasantly scented powder that, when sprinkled on skin, blended with bodys natural odors. It drastically improved even the most sweaty adventurers scent.
In 1372 DR, an exotic perfume merchant Quintessa could be found in the Chateau Elite inn in the Money Quarter of Daggerford selling jasmine dust along with other scented goods. She readily dispensed the pleasant dust as a free sample.
