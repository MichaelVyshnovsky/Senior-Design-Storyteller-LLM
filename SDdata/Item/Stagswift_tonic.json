        "mainbody": "Stagswift tonic was a type of alcoholic beverage found in the Western Heartlands, along the River Chionthar, and the city of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nStagswift tonic was a creation of several high Lathanderian monasteries. The drink possessed properties that kept the monks awake for the first rays of dawn light and, usually, staying awake from the previous evening. These concoctions were sold in small  bottles corked and decorated with the sun symbol of Lathander."
