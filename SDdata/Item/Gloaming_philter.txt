==Description==
The philter was a twice-enchanted [[glass]] [[flask]] that contained pure water from a [[Shadowfell]] spring. When thrown, it would shatter and spray the area with the liquid, afflicting victims with negative energy and draining their life force.

==History==
The [[Cult of the Dragon]] forces in [[Thunderholme]] that followed [[Aurgloroasa]] created a number of these philters in the 1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
