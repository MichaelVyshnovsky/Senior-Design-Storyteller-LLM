'''Hacksaws''' were a type of [[saw]] used to cut through metal.{{cite book/Dungeonscape|32}}

==Description==
Hacksaws were made by [[dwarf|dwarven]] craftsmen. The blades were made from hardened [[steel]], with a superior version including [[diamond]]-tipped blades. One could even find hacksaws made of [[adamantine]].

==Availability==
* In [[Athkatla]], one could find hacksaws for sale in the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]].<ref><ref group="note" name="Duty">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item featured in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold common hacksaws for 5 [[gold piece]]s and hacksaws of superior quality for 20 gp.

==Notable Users==
* Hacksaws were sometimes used by [[thieves]] or [[rogues]] throughout [[Faerûn]], such as for cutting through or around [[lock (item)|locks]], though this tactic could be quite noisy and took some time.<ref>
