An '''''ersatz eye''''' was a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] eye [[prosthetic|prosthesis]].

==Powers==
When embedded within one's eye socket, they could see through this orb as though it were a real eye. In addition, only the one wearing an ''ersatz eye'' could remove it from their eye socket.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the archeologist [[Marville DuCoot]] discovered the burial site of an ancient [[orc]] tribe in a cave system south of Bryn Shander.{{Cite adventurers league/Ice Road Trackers|14}} Within that burial site, he found an orcish-style ''ersatz eye'', which uniquely gave its wearer the additional ability of being able to read and understand [[Orcish]].{{Cite adventurers league/Ice Road Trackers|16}}

==Notable Owners==
* [[Volothamp Geddarm]] owned an ''ersatz eye'' in the late 15{{th}} century DR that had [[brass]] fittings.<ref>
