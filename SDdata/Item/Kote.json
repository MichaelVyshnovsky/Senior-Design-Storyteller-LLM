        "Description": "A pair of armored sleeves, a kote protected both arms from the back of the hand up to the shoulders. The sleeves were connected to each other by a strap of cloth or leather across the upper back. Kote were made from [[chainmail]] and sometimes had small plates of metal tailored into the chainmail as extra protection. Kote were light enough to be worn under clothing. Most kote were very plain and functional however they could be garishly decorated.\n\nKote was a key part of several suits of armor such as [[o-yoroi]].\n{{-}}"
