A '''fang''' was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
A fang is a robust iron weapon, taking inspiration from the elephant goad. It was {{SI|3|ft|c|long=yes}} in length, similar to that of a [[short sword]]. At one end, there was a sharp point, complemented by a sturdy hooked point positioned just below it.
