'''Tej''', or '''t'ej''', was an alcoholic beverage drunk in [[Chult]], where it was more common and popular than [[beer]] or [[ale]]. 

==Description==
It was made from fermented [[honey]] and [[buckthorn]], and had an amber hue. It was very sweet, which masked its fairly high alcohol content.

==Availability==
In [[Port Nyanzaru]], a [[mug]] of tej cost 4 [[cp]] and a 1-gallon cask cost 2 [[sp]], while in [[Fort Beluarian]], a mug cost 6 cp and a cask cost 3 sp.

==History==
In the late 1480s or early 1490s [[DR]], the sale of tej was controlled by the merchant prince [[Kwayoth√©]].
