        "mainbody": "'''Sinhalite''' was a rare find in streambed gravel, both active streams and ancient, dried up riverbeds. When polished cabochon or cut, these [[fancy stones]] were called '''sinhalas'''.",
        "Description": "In natural form, these crystals were rounded pebbles, tumbled and smoothed by water action. They were yellow-brown to pale straw-yellow and yielded gemstones up to 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "A sinhala could prevent magical ''[[darkness]]'' in a 20 ft (6.1 m) radius around the stone.",
