When polished cabochon or cut, these fancy stones were called sinhalas.\nIn natural form, these crystals were rounded pebbles, tumbled and smoothed by water action. They were yellow-brown to pale straw-yellow and yielded gemstones up to 1 in (2.5 cm) in diameter. A typical specimen had a base value of 100 gp.\nA sinhala could prevent magical darkness in a 20 ft (6.1 m) radius around the stone.\nCategoryGems\nCategoryFancy stones\nCategory100-149 gold pieces\nqfg30nqwhbdy2ylg8eu6thaki9vqqbj"
