        "mainbody": "'''Rab's Riotously Intense Ice Cream''' was a frozen treat made with [[garlic]], created by [[Rab Bitnez]] and featured in his cookbook ''[[101 Garlic Recipes]]''.",
        "Description": "Rab's Riotously Intense [[ice cream|Ice Cream]] was an easy recipe to make if you were an arcane spellcaster or a [[white dragon]].\n\nThe recipe consisted of four large eggs, sugar, copious amounts of cream, six cloves of garlic, and a pinch of salt. Egg whites needed to be whipped with sugar until the stiff peak consistency, then the cream needed to be whipped until light and fluffy. Both mixtures then were folded into each other gently. The next step was crushing garlic into pulp together with more sugar, then the garlic was beaten into egg yolks, and folded into the cream mixture. The tricky part came next, the wizard needed to angle the mixing bowl and cast the ''[[ray of frost]]'' into it without spillage. The iced treat then was left to soften a bit before enjoyment.",
        "Warnings": "Rab Bitnez recommended avoiding using ''[[ice storm]]'' in preparation of this sweet treat due to severe kitchen damage. [[Bards]] and [[rogues]] were recommended to use a [[wand of frost|''wand of frost'']], and residents of [[Icewind Dale]] could just leave the bowl outside in the cold for a few hours."
