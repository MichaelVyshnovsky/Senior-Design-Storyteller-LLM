        "mainbody": "A '''''crystal parrot''''' was a [[magic item]] used to detect trespassers.",
        "Description": "This item resembled a {{SI|12|in|c|long=yes}} tall parrot made from clear crystal.",
        "Powers": "''Crystal parrots'' were usually placed on a shelf or other such location with an unobstructed view of their surroundings. A [[command word]] was needed to activate the parrot. The magic caused a soft red glow to appear behind the parrot's eyes and lasted for thirty days, or it could be deactivated at any time with the command word. However, if deactivated, the ''crystal parrot'' could not be reactivated for another thirty days.\n\nA ''crystal parrot'' could see everything as a normal parrot would in a 180 degree arc in front of it up to a distance of {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}. The ''crystal parrot'' was instructed by the user as to the specific type of intruders it was to be on the watch for. This command could be as specific or as general as the user wanted. The ''crystal parrot'' would send the user a telepathic report whenever it viewed an appropriate intruder in the area. The specific actions taken by the intruders was not reported, though it would report when they entered and departed the vicinity. There was no limit on the distance the telepathic report would cover provided the user and parrot were on the same [[plane of existence]]. The user could not communicate back to the parrot. A ''crystal parrot'' would become useless if destroyed and the user would be instantly aware of its destruction.",
        "History": "Specialty priests of [[Waukeen]] called [[goldeye]]s had a chance of receiving a ''crystal parrot'' as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
