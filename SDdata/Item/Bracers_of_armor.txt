Bracers of armor were magical armor pieces for the forearms that protected the wearer with an invisible field of force that acted as a source of armor for his or her whole body.
Most bracers of armor appeared to be a pair of normal bracers.
They could come in a wide range of power levels, ranging from protection equivalent to the wearing of padded armor to the defensive capabilities of full plate mail.
Circa 1372 DR, a good number of the bracers of armor found in the wild around Neverwinter came from an armory of some unknown disbanded militia group.
Some bracers of armor, such as the bracers of the blinding strike, came with additional powers.
By 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon was using rare magically enchanted claw bracers that served as weapons and bracers of armor.
