'''''Bracers of armor''''' were magical armor pieces for the forearms that protected the wearer with an invisible field of force that acted as a source of armor for his or her whole body.

==Description==
Most ''bracers of armor'' appeared to be a pair of normal [[wikipedia:en:Bracer|bracers]].

==Powers==
They could come in a wide range of power levels, ranging from protection equivalent to the wearing of [[padded armor]] to the defensive capabilities of full [[plate mail]].

''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], a good number of the ''bracers of armor'' found in the wild around [[Neverwinter]] came from an armory of some unknown disbanded militia group.

Some ''bracers of armor'', such as the [[Bracers of the Blinding Strike|''bracers of the blinding strike'']], came with additional powers.

By [[1369 DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] was using rare magically enchanted ''[[Claw bracer|claw bracers]]'' that served as weapons and ''bracers of armor''.
