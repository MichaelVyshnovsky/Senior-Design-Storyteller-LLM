Saffron was a rare and expensive spice produced from the crocus flower.
Places in the Realms where one could find saffron being produced or sold included
* The only place in Faerûn where the crocus flower grew in abundance was Ormpur Bay in southwest Faerûn. From this flower, saffron was produced in Ormpur, which was named the "City of Saffron" for good reason.
* In interior Faerûn, saffron was commonly available in the republic of Turmish due to imports and trade.
* In Kara-Tur, saffron was one of the main spices traded through the town of Pursai in Malatra.
* Saffron was also known and used in the continent of Zakhara.
* In Ravens Bluff, where Lord Huehm Gultossan of the Gultoss family made his fortune trading saffron and other valuable spices.
Saffron was used as both a spice and a spell component. It was also one of the components in a specialized Zakharan ritual used to summon air spirits called sakina.
Saffron was said to be useful in treating measles.
Saffron was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. As a spell component, 4 ounces (113 grams) of ground saffron was sold for 4 gold pieces. As a spice, 1 ounce (28 grams) of whole saffron was sold for 45 gold pieces, making it the most expensive on offer. In general, 1 pound (0.45 kilograms) of saffron as a trade good might go for 15 gold pieces.
In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, the dowry of Chansreena (princess) Alabhansree Alanasker of Ormpur included a large quantity of saffron, as well as many magical blades. This dowry disappeared when she did.
