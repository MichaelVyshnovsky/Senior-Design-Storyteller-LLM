'''Firearms''', otherwise known as '''smokepowder weapons''', '''gunpowder weapons''',{{Cite dragon/321/The Way of the Gun|31}} '''gonnes''',<ref> or '''gunnes''' (a corruption of [[Gond]]),{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|36}} were an advanced and exotic form of ranged piercing weaponry that were great at piercing through most armors.

==Weaponology==
Firearms all utilized the same basic method of operation, requiring a high degree of hand-eye coordination to use them effectively. They fired front-loaded projectiles known as bullets.

The bullets of firearms were, much like [[bullet|sling bullets]], small ball-shaped projectiles typically made of [[bronze]], [[iron]], [[lead]], or [[steel]].{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|40}} Several magical types were known to exist, but they were quite rare.

Firearms required an explosive powder charge to propel their bullets, Depending upon the world, this was typically either [[smoke powder]] or [[gunpowder]]. Without these powders they were useless and the more common these powders were, the more prevalent firearms were.<ref><ref> This uselessness could be circumvented by incorporating melee weapons in a firearm's design, such as [[axe]]s, [[short sword]]s, hammers,{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|39}} [[dagger]]s, or [[mace]]s.

When the projectiles of these weapons were shot out they created a loud noise and cloud of thick smoke. 
The noise produced was loud regardless of substance, though smokepowder tended to produce a lower pitch, sounding more like a loud thump instead of a sharp "crack".<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2018-12-06 - Sound of Smokepowder}}

Typically firearms could only be fired once before needing to be reloaded, unless they had multiple barrels.{{Cite dragon/321/The Way of the Gun|32}} Loading could be a cumbersome process, requiring a fair amount of concentration.
===Malfunction===
Firearms had the potential to "misfire"{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}} every time they were shot,{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-04-15 - Out-of-Universe Origin of Smokepowder}} especially in worlds where the weapons were in their infancy. At its most severe this resulted in an explosion that could destroy the weapon and thus injure their operator. Otherwise, a firing mechanism might break or have something preventing it from firing.

Moisture or the wrong amount of the chosen powder could also prevent a firearm from firing, requiring it to be reloaded. The former was due to the fact that gunpowder and smokepowder were both rendered unusable after exposure to water.

===Defending Against===
Some of the best magical defenses against firearms included ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[shield]]'', most wind-based [[spell]]s, and anything that caused wetness.

==Varieties==
;[[Arquebus]]es: Otherwise known as '''hand cannons''', were relatively primitive firearms manufactured by cultures just starting to develop firearms. They were one of the first firearms in the Realms, which many others developed from.
;[[Bombard]]s: The largest of the smokepowder weapons. They could also be found be very rarely found used on ships on Toril.
;[[File:Gnome ceremorph-5e.jpg|thumb|273px|''A [[gnome ceremorph]] carries a laser pistol.'']]Laser Weapons: An incredibly rare type of firearms that came in the form of either a rifle or a pistol. Unlike other firearms, these weapons required neither bullets nor powder, being powered by something called an energy cell.Laser weaponry is documented here because of its appearance in a crashed [[nautiloid]] in the adventure ''[[Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden]]''. It is unknown where laser weaponry originates from or how common they are in wildspace in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. So taking the previously established prevalence of smokepowder into consideration, these weapons have been classified as "incredibly rare."
;[[Pistol]]s: Small single-shot firearms that only required one hand to operate.
;[[Ribald (weapon)|Ribalds]]: A type of battlefield artillery consisting of a series of small gun barrels.

==Availability==
* Firearms could be found in [[Realmspace]], both on [[Toril]] proper and on the [[Rock of Bral]],<ref> but they only used smokepowder. One particular establishment on Toril where one could purchase firearms was [[The Brigadier's Broadside]] in [[Skullport]].
* [[Cerilia]] had firearms to a limited degree, as for much of its history gunpowder and smokepowder were nonexistent. This world primarily used its own unique magical substance, known as '''hellpowder''', and even had bombards that utilized it.<ref>{{Cite dragon/232/Weapons of the Waves|14,17}}
* [[Eberron]] completely lacked firearms.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210303145901/http://keith-baker.com/firearms-in-eberron/| title = Dragonmarks: Firearms in Eberron | accessdate = 08-07-2021| date = 13-09-2018}}
* [[Earth]] had an abundant amount of firearms, many of which notably could fire multiple shots before needing to be reloaded.<ref>
* [[Mystara]] had firearms in the Savage Coast, a region in the far western portion of the planet.
* [[Oerth]] was largely absent of firearms, due to local physics and magic rendering inert the substances gunpowder
* [[Krynn]] had some primitive firearms, which were the work of [[tinker gnome]]s. Though no one on that world ever dared to enchant them, with tinker gnomes themselves regarding such a thing as "cheating."{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}}
* Beyond the planets themselves, all manner of firearms could be be found in the [[wildspace]] of many [[crystal sphere]]s,{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|38}}
* Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], firearms could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]. There their commonality varied depending upon the domain, making them not exactly a common sight, but wherever they went firearms were seen as the height of technical warfare.

==History==
Firearms were spread across the Known Spheres over time by mass migrations of tinker gnomes, by spacefaring [[human]]s, In many cases these spacefaring people were responsible for bringing firearms to worlds, such as the Smiths' Coster, a mercantile company that commonly traded with groundling nations.

During the [[Second Unhuman War]], [[humanoid]] armies and [[scro]]-led [[spelljammer]] navies sometimes carried firearms, though these were usually used only by elite or command units. When they were defeated in the war and forced to scatter, so too did their weaponry become scattered throughout wildspace.

In the wake of that war, the Smiths' Coster redoubled their efforts in spreading the use of firearms, leading them to make contact with the Lantanna, [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavians]], and other areas of Toril.
===History on Toril===
On Toril, firearms had never been extensively (or even adequately) researched and developed prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], save for a few eccentric [[wizard]]s. None of the major nations or organizations on the planet invested the time or money into producing firearms on a large scale. Not even the ancient [[Netheril|Netherese empire]] had the most basic of firearms, the arquebus.<ref>

In [[1246 DR]], the first recorded use of bombards by the island nation of [[Lantan]] occurred.<ref><ref> These bombards utilized gunpowder, as the deity [[Gond]] had yet to render the substance inert{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-08 - When Gunpowder Went Inert}} out of concern for his worshipers' safety.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}}

Everything changed during the [[Time of Troubles]], when Gond in his mortal [[avatar]] form washed up on the shore of Lantan. In return for the people there sheltering him, in [[1358 DR]] he revealed to the Lantanna how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder, such as the arquebus and its variations.

In the first three years that followed, arquebuses were introduced to the wider Realms. During these years they were viewed primarily as curios. Some tried to produce their own firearms, but they were inferior to those made by the Lantanna. The Realms also experienced a slow influx of arquebuses overtime from spelljamming sources.<ref>

From the third to fifth year of their existence, arquebuses and their variants became more common. Well-stocked weapon shops began to carry them, those who wielded them were no longer looked at strangely, and their price dropped significantly. From the fifth year onwards it was possible to find firearms in large stores.

[[Felogyr Sonshal]] slowly became a major reseller for Lantan, distributing their firearms across the [[Sword Coast]]. But he carefully controlled his stock, ensuring that merchant families and [[thieves' guild]]s could not amass large amounts.<ref>

By [[1372 DR]], firearms were available throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. Around that time many of Gond's clerics supported themselves financially by selling ammunition for smokepowder weapons.<ref> Many rulers at this time viewed the [[Church of Gond]] with ire for having introduced firearms to the continent, seeing the weapons as a threat to their authority.<ref>

Around this time, following the Lantanna pirate [[Gimlet Watersprecht]]'s creation of a ''[[portal]]'' between Lantan and the [[Pirate Isles]], there was a frightening rise in the number of smokepower and smokepowder weapons among pirates in the [[Inner Sea]]. This posed a great concern to the kingdom of Cormyr's then-princess and regent, [[Alusair Obarskyr]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of Lantan:Lantan to Pirate Isle}}

In the late-15{{th}} century DR, following the [[Second Sundering]] returning it from the parallel-world of [[Abeir]], the island nation of Lantan became more secretive. From the occasional glimpses that outsiders got of the Lantanna, they got the impression that their technology had become more advanced in the time since their absence. This in turn lead some to speculate about what developments the Lantanna may have made in regards to smokepowder weapons.
