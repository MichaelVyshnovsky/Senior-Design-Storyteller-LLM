Ironfell rings, commonly called iron rings, were signature enchanted rings worn by the Warlock Knights and Luminaries of Vaasa.
These rings were made of ironfell. Most looked no different than a plain iron ring (although perhaps with less luster and a somewhat crystalline structure), or runes. These rings were a symbol of a Warlock Knights status and power.
As they were made of ironfell, these rings allowed the Warlock Knight to channel the power of Telos, Higher-ranking Knights were known to enchant their rings with additional magic.
The Ironfell rings also served as the foci for the Pact of the Iron Ring, a ritual in which two or more Knights swore oaths to each other that were unbreakable, lest the Knight incur the pactbroken curse. Performing this ritual called for the Knights to present their rings, which would begin to glow purple as the ritual commenced. 
Ironfell rings were used by Luminaries in the raising of shardsouls.
By the late 15 century DR, the Warlock Knights produced nonmagical versions of their iron rings that could be given to their servants and allies, thus enabling them to form a Pact of the Iron Ring with them. The Knights were also known to call for pacts and promises to be made on their rings with allies who did not possess a ring of their own, although the consequences of violating such an oath were unclear.
