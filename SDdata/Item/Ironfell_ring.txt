'''''Ironfell rings''''', commonly called '''''iron rings''''', were signature [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s worn by the [[Warlock Knights]] and [[Luminaries]] of [[Vaasa]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|9}}

==Description==
These rings were made of ''[[ironfell]]''. Most looked no different than a plain [[iron]] ring (although perhaps with less luster and a somewhat crystalline structure),{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} or runes. These rings were a symbol of a Warlock Knight's status and power.

==Powers==
As they were made of ''ironfell'', these rings allowed the Warlock Knight to channel the power of [[Telos]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|12,14}} Higher-ranking Knights were known to enchant their rings with additional magic.

The ''Ironfell rings'' also served as the foci for the [[Pact of the Iron Ring]], a [[ritual]] in which two or more Knights swore oaths to each other that were unbreakable, lest the Knight incur the ''[[pactbroken curse]]''. Performing this ritual called for the Knights to present their rings, which would begin to glow purple as the ritual commenced. 

''Ironfell rings'' were used by Luminaries in the raising of [[shardsoul]]s.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Warlock Knights produced nonmagical versions of their ''iron rings'' that could be given to their servants and allies, thus enabling them to form a Pact of the Iron Ring with them.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|8}} The Knights were also known to call for pacts and promises to be made on their rings with allies who did not possess a ring of their own, although the consequences of violating such an oath were unclear.
