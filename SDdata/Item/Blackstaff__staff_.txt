The '''Blackstaff''' was the name for a series of powerful magical staves, created and used by [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and/or his successor.

==Description==
;Khelben's Blackstaff:
It was believed that Khelben Arunsun, who carried the first [[Blackstaff]] title, selected a new Blackstaff every time he left [[Blackstaff Tower]]. However, it always appeared as a long wooden staff. It was longer than an average human was tall, roughly seven feet from base to tip.  A ring of bulbs circled the staff at about eye level, and the staff was topped by a curved claw shape. The entire staff was pure black in color. 

;Samark's Staff
[[Samark Dhanzscul]], the sixth Blackstaff, carried a staff known as the Duskstaff, which was a twisted metal staff with a crystal on top that flashed various colors. It was unknown whether this was an iteration of a Blackstaff or a different staff. The Duskstaff could only be moved by the current Blackstaff or by someone wielding [[Ncral's Ring]].

;Vajra's Blackstaff:
[[Vajra Safahr]], the seventh Blackstaff, carried a silver-shod Blackstaff. The Blackstaff she carried when proclaiming her status as the new Blackstaff was the "true blackstaff", a large rune-inscribed [[duskwood]] staff with silver veins. The whole staff was blackened by use. Atop the staff was a large axe head in the shape of snarling wolf head, which had glowing green eyes.

==Known powers==
The Blackstaff had all the powers of a [[staff of power]]. 

The staff also had a [[permanent]] [[blackstaff (spell)]] upon it that could&hellip;
* &hellip;grant an [[enhancement]] when used in melee combat, 
* &hellip;[[dispel magic]] with a touch,  
* &hellip;cause a spellcaster to loose a spell or expend a bit of their magical power, and
* &hellip;channel various [[mind-affecting]] spells. 

A Blackstaff's Heir needed to touch the Blackstaff in order to be centered in his or her new powers. Only a Blackstaff or the Blackstaff's Heir could safely carry and wield a Blackstaff. As long as a Blackstaff's Heir was touching the Blackstaff, the powers of the actual Blackstaff (person) could be channeled through the staff.
