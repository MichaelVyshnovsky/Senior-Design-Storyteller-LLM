        "Description": "Gruel was a gooey mash, stew, or soup, made with bread and a common food made by travelers and adventurers on the road. Hearty gruel was often cooked from [[oat]]s, [[rice]], or [[barley]], with [[stock]], salted meats like [[coney]] or [[pork]], and seasoned with dried or fresh [[herb]]s and spices from travers' pouches.{{Cite living city/A Cleric in Crow's End|12}} [[Vani]] [[gnome]]s of the [[Samek Valley]] in the [[Cold Lands]] made their staple dish – hot gruel [[porridge]]. On the islands of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], gruel was made into [[congee]] using rice and flavored with [[fish]]. The gruel was served with deep-fried bread for dipping.",
        "History": "[[File:Murlynd's Spoon.png|thumb|''[[Murlynd's spoon]] and its magically generated nourishing gruel.''|295x295px]]\nGruel was a food consumed as early as the ancient empire of [[Netheril]], where it was made with bread and water. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], putrid grey [[maggot]]-infested gruel was fed to criminals imprisoned in the dungeons of [[Waterdeep]] as well as in the slave quarter of the monster city of [[Kushk]] in the [[Hordelands]]. Slightly more palatable simple gruel was fed to individuals captured and enslaved by the pirates and [[orc]]ish slavers that sailed the [[Korinn Archipelago]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[wizard]] [[Akabar Bel Akash]] who recently joined [[Alias]] the Sellsword's adventuring group, used his culinary skills to make hearty gruel soup, well spiced and seasoned. His [[hin]] traveling companion [[Olive Ruskettle]] happily devoured her serving and asked for seconds, despite Akabar seasoning her portion with excessive amount of fiery [[pepper]]s.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Zhentil Keep]] in the [[Moonsea]] region faced with famine under the deity [[Cyric]]'s tyrannical rule. Most commoners in the city, especially in the slums, saw little food apart from stale water and gruel. In the following year, the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] fed gruel to its abductees made slaves in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] while the cult worked on excavations and control of the city's ''[[mythal]]''."
