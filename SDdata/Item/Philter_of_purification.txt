Philters of purification were elven potions that cleansed the imbibers body from diseases and some other afflictions.
These potions were used for their curative properties that cleared almost all deceases as well as cured blindness and deafness of both magical and mundane nature.
Circa 1281 DR, these elvish positions were somewhat common in the lands of far north Faer√ªn. They could be found in cities of the Ten Towns and even in Castle Maluradek of Anauroch.
