        "mainbody": "A jump dagger was a seemingly mundane dagger that possessed three magical abilities.\nUpon grasping the blade, it affected the wielder with a constant feather fallâ€“like effect.\nThe wielder could also, at-will, jump into the air as per the spell jump. Doing so would negate the feather fall effect.\nBy pointing the dagger, the wielder could also move a certain, small, nonliving object, under 3 in diameter and 100 lbs in weight, up to 30 away.\nOne of the crafting methods of a jump dagger required the use of the spells feather fall, jump, and levitate along with a specific method of tempering. The oil used in this process contained the blood of a blink dog or displacer beast or the ichor of a beholder.\nAnother method involved the use of jump and mage hand spells."
