Goldenstar was a stuffed-bread snack food popular in Berdusk.
Goldenstars were triangular loaves of eggbread, stuffed with ground sausage, diced potatos (or other tubers), and drowned in chicken sauce. This handfood was often sold for only one copper piece.
A typical meal in taverns of Berdusk consisted of a cup of soup, stew, or broth, a tankard of ale, and a plate filled with goldenstars, seared bacon, sausage, or chicken, drowned in hearty gravy.
