        "mainbody": "'''Exeltis Ice Wine''' was a rare type of red [[wine]] pressed and bottled by the [[Exeltis]] family in their keep in the [[Blade Cliffs]] of the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Description": "Exeltis Ice Wine was considered one of the best wines in the [[Realms]]. The ice wine was fermented using the juice of small grey [[grape]]s that were cultivated along the Blade Cliffs, the lands that surrounded [[Castle Exeltis]].\n\nThe wine was aged in enormous wooden kegs in the castle's basements before being bottled in fanciful bottles of blueish and purple glass.",
        "History": "The original recipe for Exeltis Ice Wine was developed by [[Cedric Exeltis]]. The Exeltis family continued production of the fine red wine for several generations that followed. By [[1372 DR]], the Exeltis clan and their wine business were in decline. Due to its quality, reputation, and rarity, Exeltis Ice Wine was considered an extremely rare and valuable vintage."
