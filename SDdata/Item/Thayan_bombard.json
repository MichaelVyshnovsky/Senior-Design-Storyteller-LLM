        "Description": "Much like a standard bombard, these weapons were made from cast [[iron]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/11-29 - Waterdhavian Bombards and Boneballs}} with some describing the hulking immobile sentries as being larger than any manor house in the city of [[Waterdeep]].The [[Dungeon magazine]] adventure [[Dungeon magazine 66/Operation Manta Ray|\"Operation Manta Ray\"]] features Thayan bombards and states their dimensions on page 52. Though not stated in the text to be the \"heavy\" variant, the bombards in the adventure can be surmised as being such based on the targeting range given for them. The dimensions in the adventure for a \"heavy Thayan bombard\" are stated to be a length of {{SI|5|ft}} and a diameter of {{SI|5|ft}}, which are far smaller than being \"larger than a Waterdhavian manor house\".

        "History": "Development on the ''Thayan bombard'' began after Thayan spies reported upon the testing of standard bombards that was being conducted on the island nation of [[Lantan]], the first recorded instance of which occurred in {{YearlinkName|1246}},<ref><ref> as the Red Wizards declared it was necessary for Thay to command such armaments themselves. The first experiments were conducted in [[1312 DR]]. These experiments were quite disastrous, shredding some poor Red Wizards into little bits. The first successful experiment would be achieved in the {{YearlinkName|1314}}.\n\nThe first offensive use of a ''Thayan bombard'' occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1316}}, against a group of living targets that Red Wizards had surrounded. This group was chosen as the Red Wizards were certain that they had no chance of escaping and it was considered critical that the weapon remained a secret.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1349}}, development began on a new variety of ammunition, glass bombs that could mimic spell effects other than simply ''fireball''. Over the two decades that followed experiments would be conducted, first upon inanimate targets within Thay and later upon living targets along the nation's border with [[Mulhorand]], such as brigands.\n\nSometime long before [[1356 DR]],It is not known exactly when the pirates of the Pirate Isles obtained their ''Thayan bombards'', but all early sources repeat the fact that it happened \"a long time ago\". With the first ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' being our earliest source, it had to have occurred before the year 1356 DR. the pirates of the [[Pirate Isles]] somehow obtained eight ''Thayan bombards'',Nor is it known exactly how the pirates of the Pirate Isles got their hands on ''Thayan bombards'', considering that the Red Wizards are very defensive of their inventions. For example, on page 24 of ''[[Dreams of the Red Wizards]]'' one of the rules of the Red Wizards is stated to be that, \"...no enchanted item that has military usefulness may be sold outside the country or to a representative of some power outside the country.\" making them the only entities outside of Thay to possess those wondrous weapons. On the [[Citadel of Immurk's Hold|Citadel]] of [[Immurk's Hold]] each of these bombards were sat atop a free turning base, marked with 360 degree marks, and had a hand-screw mechanism that allowed them to be elevated from 45 to 85 degree angles. The hold's pirates ran daily drills to ensure their teams of human signal flag wavers and [[ogre]] bombardiers were quite efficient.\n\nHowever, this great defensive power for the Pirate Isles came at a great cost, for the ''Thayan bombards'' were reliant upon the fire-fluid  and precious powder needed to fire these weapons. The pirates purchased both from the [[tharchion]]ess of [[Bezantur]], [[Mari Agneh]],<ref> who parted with both precious substances at a high price. Around [[1359 DR]], a small contingent of [[Gondar]] [[cleric]]s were on Dragonisle, working with the pirates to discover if it was possible for the bombards to utilize [[Lantan]]na's smokepowder in place of the secret powder the bombards were designed to use. This was all done in secrecy, for the Thayans highly valued the monopoly they had on the substances needed to use their bombards and would consider the pirates to be enemies if they were to find out about this treachery.\n\nUp until the 1360's DR, This was due to a combination of their extreme value, the great effort that was required to transport them, and the Red Wizards' desire to keep them a secret. The ''Thayan bombard'' would finally see battlefield usage in the 1360's DR,\n\nWithin Thay itself, dozens of ''Thayan bombards'' were stationed on the island tharch of [[Alaor]], which housed the nation's main naval base as well as extensive shipbuilding and repair facilities.{{Cite web/theedverse/2016-10-25 - 15th Century Update on Status of Cannons}} the Thayans managed to circumvent this by specially designing ships that could handle them.\n\nThe first such ship was the ''[[Red Scourge]]'', an impressive warship constructed of enameled red iron and magic. It was outfitted with twenty four light bombards, twelve on each side. A Red Wizard was required to be stationed on the ship at all times in order to supervise the use of the bombards and command their bombardiers. For the sake of safety, the ship's five hundred bombs were kept within iron lockers that were enspelled with an effect equivalent to a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''. The ''Red Scourge'' continued to be in action by 1372 DR, but by then the Thayan navy had expanded, developing over a dozen [[dromond]]s that were each capable of being outfitted with a pair of light ''Thayan bombards''."
