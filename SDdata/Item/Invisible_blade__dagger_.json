        "Powers": "''Invisible blades'' appeared as only a hilt, their blades being all-but invisible, making them easily concealable. Although invisible, the blade struck as a regular weapon, was always silent when it struck, and never reflected light. Only the wielder of the dagger could see the weapon's blade, as if they were using the ''[[detect invisibility]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Creation": "To craft an ''invisible blade'', the spells ''[[invisibility]]'', ''detect invisibility'', ''[[gaze reflection]]'', and a form of magical ''[[silence]]'' were used on the dagger as it was being forged."
