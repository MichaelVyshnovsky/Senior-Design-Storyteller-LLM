The Jaws of Malice was a crude shortbow crafted by one of the orcish tribes that tried to carve out territory in the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.
The Jaws of Malice was bow of apparent poor craftsmanship, carved and decorated with tribal markings.
This bows peculiar construction allowed for an easier chance of landing a critical strike on a target however, it was hard to handle. The Jaws was also imbued with magic enhancing its damage output, similar to the ordinary +3 enchantment.
In 1369 DR, the Sharpstick clan of ormyrr made a home in the Deep Halls of the Dwarven Dungeons of Myth Drannor. Constantly struggling for territory, the clan was forced out by a tribe of strong orcs, who wielded the Jaws of Malice among other arms. After the orcish tribe was driven out by the Veiled Ones, ormyrr offered the adventurers Jaws of Malice, looted off one of the orc corpses who fell in the struggle.
