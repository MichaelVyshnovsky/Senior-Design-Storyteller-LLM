Marsember ice wine was a type of wine from the city of Marsember in Cormyr. It was exported to the Western Heartlands, the Chionthar Valley, and the city of Baldurs Gate, as of the late 15 century DR.
The ice wine had a light and refreshing taste, like the mist hanging over the citys many channels. Its flavor perfectly captured the feeling of its city of origin, apart from the aroma of dead monkfish.
