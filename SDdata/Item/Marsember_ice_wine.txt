'''Marsember ice wine''' was a type of [[wine]] from the city of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was exported to the [[Western Heartlands]], the [[Chionthar Valley]], and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ice wine had a light and refreshing taste, like the mist hanging over the city's many channels. Its flavor perfectly captured the feeling of its city of origin, apart from the aroma of dead [[monkfish]].
