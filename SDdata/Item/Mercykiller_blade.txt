'''''Mercykiller blades''''' were [[enchanted]] [[rapier]]s created to smite evil in the hands of worthy wielders.

==Description==
The blades of these rapiers were inscribed with runes that read as the following: "quick eradication of evil, that they will suffer no longer as creatures at odds with all that is good."

==Powers==
''Mercykiller blades'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and were especially deadly when wielded against creatures that venerated evil and malice.

==History==
Judging by the sweeping proclamation on the weapon, sages speculated that ''Mercykiller blades'' were a product of some radical organization that was happy and willing to use deadly force on evil individuals. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one such blade was in the hands of one of Lord [[Temar]]'s men stationed in his estate in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Blacklake District]].
