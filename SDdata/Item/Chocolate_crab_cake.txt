Chocolate crab cakes were a peculiar brand of gnomish highsunfeast dessert from the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast.
Chocolate crab cakes were a sweet variant of regular crab cakes, fried and dipped in a thick chocolate syrup that formed a shell round them. The dish tasted unique, while others called it delicious.
Chocolate crab cakes were the specialty dish of a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called Le PoTeete Café in the late 14 century DR. Less adventurous customers preferred the other dessert on the menu - simple berry bowls.
