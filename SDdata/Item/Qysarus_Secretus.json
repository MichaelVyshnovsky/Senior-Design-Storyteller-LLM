        "mainbody": "'''''Qysarus Secretus''''' was one of the twelve ''[[Qysari Rings]]'' made for the rulers of the [[Shoon Imperium]]. It protected the wearer from all forms of magical and [[psionic]] detection and [[scrying]].",
        "Description": "Magic rings made during the sixth age of [[Calimshan]] ([[27 DR|27]] â€“ [[450 DR]]), were constructed of twisted bands of two different metals and were known as ''[[shoonring]]s''. What easily distinguished the ''Qysari Rings'' from ordinary ''shoonrings'' was that they changed form depending on the nature of the person wearing them. When placed on the finger of a [[cleric]], [[druid]], or other priest, the direction of the metal weave turned at right angles to the circumference of the ring. If donned by [[warrior]]s or [[rogue]]s, the raised pattern became smooth to the touch but still visible. [[Wizard]]s saw no change in the design when it was placed on their finger.",
        "Powers": "The wearer of this ring became essentially undetectable  and unknowable by magical means, such as a ''[[crystal ball]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[detect evil and good]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', and ''[[detect undead]]''. It also protected against psionic means of detection or information gathering.",
        "History": "This ring was made for [[Shoon VII]] and presumably remained in his possession even after he faked his own death and his subsequent achievement of [[lichdom]]. Over the next seven hundred years he deteriorated into a [[demilich]] and it was believed that he hid most of his magical treasures in caches around the Shoon empire so they would not fall into the claws of [[Iryklathagra]], the [[blue dragon]] that collected a tribute from the [[Shoon Dynasty]] every century."
