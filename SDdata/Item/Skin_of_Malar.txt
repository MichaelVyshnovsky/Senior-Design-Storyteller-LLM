The '''''skin of Malar''''' was a minor [[artifact]] of [[Malar]].

==Description==
Fashioned from the hide of a [[beast of Malar]], the bloodstained ''skin'' had a hood made from the beast's head.

==Powers==
The ''skin of Malar'' acted as magically enhanced [[leather armor]], granting to its wearer resistance to numerous hazards, such as [[acid]], cold, electricity, [[fire]], and sound.

The cloak could only be worn by a worshiper of [[Malar]]. Anyone else attempting to don the cloak suffered extremely deleterious effects.
