The skin of Malar was a minor artifact of Malar.
Fashioned from the hide of a beast of Malar, the bloodstained skin had a hood made from the beasts head.
The skin of Malar acted as magically enhanced leather armor, granting to its wearer resistance to numerous hazards, such as acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sound.
The cloak could only be worn by a worshiper of Malar. Anyone else attempting to don the cloak suffered extremely deleterious effects.
