        "mainbody": "The '''''squatting toad''''' was a magical chalice carved in the shape of a [[toad]]. It was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.",
        "Powers": "The ''squatting toad'' could be used to cast the spell ''[[creeping darkness]]''.\n\nFurthermore, one who drank any kind of beverage from the cup would permanently gain slightly increased strength and agility but reduced charisma, as well as the ability to swim. They would also grow 1–4 inches (2.5–10 cm) in height. However, this would only happen once; repeating the ceremony or imbibing again would have no effect.",
        "History": "As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''squatting toad''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. The ''squatting toad'' came into the possession of the folk of the island of [[Saishu]].\n\nIn the mid–14th century [[DR]], the grateful people of Saishu presented the ''squatting toad'' as a gift to King [[Wanang Sun]], for lifting the oppressive regime of the [[Sillan Empire]]. It was in his possession by [[1357 DR]]."
