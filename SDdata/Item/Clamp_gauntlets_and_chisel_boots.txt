'''Clamp gauntlets''' and '''chisel boots''' were [[gnome|gnomish]] contraptions designed to aid in climbing surfaces.

==Uses==
Narrow-tipped fingers and toes, combined with a ratcheted clamp mechanism, allowed a climber to usually find a handhold on most exterior surfaces made from wood or stone. These items were favored by [[thieves]]. Wearing clamp gauntlets or chisel boots during combat did negatively affect the wearer's skill with their weapon and slowed them down.

These items could not be used effectively with other climbing equipment.

==Prices==
Clamp gauntlets and chisel boots cost 25 [[gold piece]]s for each pair through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]].
