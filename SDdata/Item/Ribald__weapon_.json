        "mainbody": "Ribalds, also known as Gonds Pipes, were a type of artillery and the closest that the Gondsmen had ever come to producing battlefield weaponry.\nRibalds consisted of a series of small gun barrels, twelve in total, laid side-by-side and clamped together, and mounted upon two-wheeled carts. These carts sometimes had a shield to protect the operators from arrows.\nTheir touch holes were arranged in such a way\nRibalds took quite some time time to load or reload. This was because all of their barrels had to be cleaned out, filled with a charge of smokepowder and a projectile, wadded, tamped down, and finally primed.\nThe projectiles fired by ribalds were far too small to breach walls.\nOn the world of Toril, the ribald originated on the island nation of Lantan, during the Time of Troubles, after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate firearms that utilized smokepowder."
