        "mainbody": "'''Ribalds''', also known as '''Gond's Pipes''', were a type of artillery and the closest that the [[Gondsman (class)|Gondsmen]] had ever come to producing battlefield weaponry.",
        "Description": "Ribalds consisted of a series of small gun barrels, twelve in total, laid side-by-side and clamped together, and mounted upon two-wheeled carts. These carts sometimes had a shield to protect the operators from [[arrow]]s.\n\nTheir touch holes were arranged in such a way{{Cite dragon/60/Firearms|24}}",
        "Weaponology": "Ribalds took quite some time time to load or reload. This was because all of their barrels had to be cleaned out, filled with a charge of [[smokepowder]] and a projectile, wadded, tamped down, and finally primed.\n\nThe projectiles fired by ribalds were far too small to breach walls.",
        "History": "On the world of [[Toril]], the ribald originated on the island nation of [[Lantan]], during the [[Time of Troubles]], after the deity Gond revealed to his followers how to make reasonably safe and accurate [[firearm]]s that utilized smokepowder."
