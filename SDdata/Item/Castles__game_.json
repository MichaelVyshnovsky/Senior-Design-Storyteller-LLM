The girl showed little interest and accused the jordaini of cheating when she swiftly lost the game. Lord Mayor Procopio loved strategy games such as chess, castles, various card games, and magically enchanted and immaculately-crafted miniature wargames depicting the Nath and the historic battle of the Mycontils Stand. Procopio Septus used them to prepare himself for the much-desired future as the next Netyarch of Halruaa."
