        "mainbody": "A chime of exile was a magic item that allowed its user to cast a more powerful version of the banishment spell.\nThe chime of exile was silver in color, adorned with magical sigils engraved into its surface.\nWhen holding the chime, the user could cast banishment. This enhanced version of the spell would always succeed in banishing its target, unless the target was very powerful. In such cases, the spell had a chance of failure, similar to casting it normally.\nIn the late 1490s DR, a chime of exile belonging to Alustriel Silverhand could be found at her sanctum in Sigil."
