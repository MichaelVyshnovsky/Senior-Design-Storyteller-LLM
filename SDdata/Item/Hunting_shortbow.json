        "Description": "''Hunting shortbows'' were strong and thick [[ash]]-[[wood]] weapons.",
        "Powers": "These bows were imbued with a [[ranger]]'s magic that felt like a [[ghost]]'s wisp in the shooter's hands. The wielder of this shortbow could place a ''[[hunter's mark]]'' on a creature once per day. Additionally, the weapon made it easier to shoot a monstrosity, and it possessed a simple ''+1'' magic of guidance and damage boost.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Dammon]], a [[tiefling]] smith from the town of [[Elturel]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
