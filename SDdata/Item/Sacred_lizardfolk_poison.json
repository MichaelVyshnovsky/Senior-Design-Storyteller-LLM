        "mainbody": "This '''sacred poison''' was used by the [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Vast Swamp]] in [[Cormyr]].<ref group=\"note\">The name of this poison is unknown; \"sacred lizardfolk poison\" is used here for linking purposes only.",
        "Effect": "When poisoning occurred, the victim suffered instant paralysis for two to twelve minutes unless they had the fortitude to resist it.",
        "Users": "The [[Poison Dusk]] lizardfolk of the Vast Swamp typically used this poison on their arrows to incapacitate foes, such as when they tried to ambush and capture a group of adventurers at the [[Skull Staff]] in the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]]. They typically laughed when a foe was paralyzed by it.\n\n[[Kessessek]], chieftain of the [[Sharptooth]] lizardfolk, declined to share it with the adventurers afterwards, saying it was sacred to the god [[Semuanya]].<ref group=\"note\">This poison is the only one used by lizardfolk in the ''[[Cormyr: The Tearing of the Weave]]'' module, and only by Poison Dusk lizardfolk, suggesting it might be specific to that tribe. However, Kessessek of the Sharptooth tribe has a response refusing to give it to PCs, in a scene where Poison Dusks are apparently no longer present. This article assumes he is referring to this specific poison, and not to any or all poisons the lizardfolk might have."
