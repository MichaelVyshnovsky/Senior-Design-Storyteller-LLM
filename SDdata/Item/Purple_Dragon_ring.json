In 1372 DR, it was reported that over 4,000 of these rings had been made.\nAn individual had to be wearing such a ring to enter an area protected by a ring ward.\nThe ring had the ability to produce magical light in a  sphere up to  away. This light source lasted ten minutes and could not be turned off except by dispelling of some sort.\nThe ring could also be activated to detect poison in gases, liquids, and solids that it came into contact with. It glowed a golden-green color if poison was present.\nWhile activated, it would also glow bright blue if placed in contact with anything carrying a magical enchantment.\nIf this ring was worn on the same hand as a commanders ring, they were treated as wearing only one ring.\nThese rings were valued at 2,125 gold pieces each. Other reports record their value at around 4,000 gold pieces.\n* Mirt the Moneylender\n* Bardanther Uleeyon, who went missing during the heist of Waevors Wagon in 1227 DR.\n* Faril Laheralson, garrison leader in Thunderstone circa 1370 DR.\n* Purple Dragons Ranks of lionar and above would normally have one of these rings.\nOne of these rings went missing along with its owner, Bardanther Uleeyon, in 1227 DR.
