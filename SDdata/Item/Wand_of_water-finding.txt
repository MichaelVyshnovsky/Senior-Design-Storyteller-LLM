A '''''wand of water-finding''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[wand]] that would alert the wielder to nearby water.

==Powers==
When activated, this wand would vibrate if potable water was within {{SI|50|mi|k|long=yes}} of the wielder. The intensity of the wand's vibrations would increase the closer the wielder came to the source of water. Additionally, the wand could shoot a beam of energy into the earth and draw water to the wielder from depths up to {{SI|500|ft|long=yes}}.
