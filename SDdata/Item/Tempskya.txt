Tempskya is what petrified wood was called in the Realms.
Specimens came in many colors, from black and white to red, yellow, brown, and sometimes pink. They could be as big as the original tree or plant was before it was buried, and they retained the trees structure. Tempskya was sometimes difficult to polish because of inclusions of quartz, opal, or chalcedony which fractured the surface and had different hardness than the substrate. Tempskya was usually cut in slabs, polished and used for inlays, but could be cut cabochon and used in jewelry. A typical price was 1 gp per pound (2.2 gp/kg).
Tempskya was a substitute for the material component in all arcane magic spells dealing with petrification. It was also used as a component when enchanting items that concerned petrification.
