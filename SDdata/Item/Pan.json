        "Description": "A pan was a shallow dish used for frying or baking food. Magically enhancement for pans was usually a practical property relating to their use in cooking.\n\nThey were often crafted from plain [[iron]], and could be easily made by casting freshly smelted iron into a simple [[clay]] mold. Along with being polished and finished from the raw metal, they could be fitted with a metal or wooden handle.{{Cite dragon/316/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Black Dwarf Mine|74-77}}{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}\n\n{{Border box float\n| theme        = \n| float        = right\n| contentalign = center\n| width        = 350px\n| styles       = \n| content      = '''''[[Merchants' map]] for the production of a skillet'''''<br/>{{Family tree}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftn|Mining and smelting ore}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{│}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftn|Casting and forging metal}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftn|Cutting and drying wood}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{└}}{{┬}}{{┘}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftn|Polishing and drilling, fitting handle}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{│}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftn|''[[Everbright]]'' enchantment<ref group=\"note\">It was extremely uncommon for a cast iron skillet to be given such an enchantment.}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{│}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftn|Packaging and transport}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{│}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/Row start}}\n{{Ftb}}{{Ftb}}{{Ftn|Sale}}{{Ftb}}\n{{Family tree/Row end}}\n{{Family tree/End}}\n}}",
