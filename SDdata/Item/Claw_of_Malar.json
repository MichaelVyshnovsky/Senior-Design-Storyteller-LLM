        "Description": "The Claw of Malar was an actual humanoid right hand, with gray skin and long, pointed fingernails. It clutched tightly a clear bauble. The wrist was set into an ornate golden cuff, which was suspended from a cord, enabling it to be worn around the neck.",
        "History": "The Claw of Malar came into the possession of [[Pasha]] [[Abon Duum]] of [[Manshaka]],{{Cite comic/The Last Betrayal|2}} With its power, he thought he could challenge the power of [[Tyr]], the Just God. Duum wore it on a cord around his neck.\n\nHowever, in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], when Duum finally came to [[Gladsheim]] to confront Tyr, he was surprised to find the thief [[Conner]] instead. The [[Catlord (old)|Catlord]] snatched away the Claw of Malar and passed it to Conner. Ultimately, the real Tyr showed up and took the Claw; Conner had made a secret deal to bring him the Claw. Duum was left to cower before the god."
