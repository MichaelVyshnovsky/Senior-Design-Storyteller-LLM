Shylos Slicer was an intelligent shortsword in the possession of Hogan Underwood, who once used the alias of Shylo Slick.
Shylos Slicer was not just a very powerful sword. It could teleport up to 600 pounds once per day, and it detected when passages sloped. It was also more than fairly intelligent.
