Many of them included examples of important families and organizations crests. Each case held enough pens, quills, waxes, gold and silver leaf, and inks of many colors to produce convincing documents of almost any complexity. A single case had enough supplies for ten forgeries.\nForgery kits were commonly used by various charlatans, smugglers, and shade fanatics of the Realms."
