        "mainbody": "Forgery kits were collections of tools and supplies used for various illicit activities and frauds, usually including such items as seal waxes, parchments, and inks, smuggled, or stolen from various officials desks.\nGenerally, forgery kits were small boxes or cases that held supplies necessary for the forgery of official documents, identifications, and other papers. Many of them included examples of important families and organizations crests. Each case held enough pens, quills, waxes, gold and silver leaf, and inks of many colors to produce convincing documents of almost any complexity. A single case had enough supplies for ten forgeries.\nForgery kits were commonly used by various charlatans, smugglers, and shade fanatics of the Realms."
