Gamalons gem of infravision and detect magic was an enchanted prosthetic, similar to the gems of seeing.
Gamalons gem was a large ersatz eye carved out of emerald.
The gem eye had as a permanent infravision spell active, allowing Gamalon Idogyr, its owner, to see even in the deepest darkness of the Underdark. Additionally, Gamalons gem had a permanent detect magic spell weaved into its enchantments.
Gamalon Idogyr lost his left eye at a relatively young age and had it replaced with a unique emerald – a gem of infravision and detect magic. Since then, Gamalon had been weeping the green gem in his left eye socket at all times, not only for its magical properties but also for the appearances – Gamalons gem made the mage memorable and fearsome.
