'''''Night extract''''' was a magical liquid used by [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadow fey]] to cast an area in darkness.

==Crafting==
''Night extract'' could be brewed by a spellcaster who knew the ''[[light]]'' spell and the art of crafting wondrous items.

==Powers==
When smashed open, usually by being hurled or dropped, a vial of ''night extract'' reduced the ambient light of an area to distance of 20 feet (6.1 meters), to the equivalent illumination of starlight. Mundane illumination was nulled, but magical illumination continued to function, countering the darkness. It also made it harder to spot lurking creatures. The ''night extract'' worked for 10 minutes.
