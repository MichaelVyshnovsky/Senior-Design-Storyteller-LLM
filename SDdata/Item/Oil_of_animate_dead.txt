'''''Oil of animate dead''''' was a potion that could be rubbed onto a corpse or bones to create either a [[zombie]] or a [[skeleton]]. The first creature that it saw was regarded as its master and it would obey commands as if it were under the influence of the spell ''[[animate dead]]''. It could only be used on a medium-sized or smaller creature. A vial was worth around 1500 [[gold piece]]s.
