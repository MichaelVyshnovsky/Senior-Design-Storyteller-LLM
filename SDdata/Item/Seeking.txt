Seeking was a weapon quality that could only be applied to ranged weapons.
When fired at a target, the ammunition of these weapons would veer toward the target, moving around anything concealing or obscuring it. However, it would not seek out enemies if their whereabouts were not known to the wielder.
It required a spell of true seeing in the weapons creation.
