        "mainbody": "Belt of Raumathar was a powerful enchanted item uncovered in the Ring of Gray Flames of the Endless Wastes sometime before the late 14 century DR.\nThis belt fortified the wearers abilities to wield arcane magics by giving them superior focus in handling evocation spells and granting the skill to weave penetrating spells. Additionally, the belt of Raumathar allowed the wearer to cast several powerful versions of the spells fireburst, magic missile, prismatic spray, and sunburst once per day, while the magic missile spell could be slung thrice per day.\nIt was unknown if the belt of Raumathar was a unique item, but one such waistband was recovered from the ruins known as the Ring of Gray Flames in the Endless Wastes sometime before the . The name of Raumathar being given to the belt was scholarly speculation on its unknown origins however, magics weaved into the belt suggested it was in use by Raumathari evokers. As the belt of Raumathar granted the wearer abilities that a Raumathari battlemage already could harness with ease, sages speculated that it belonged to an ally or a friend of a Raumathari battlemage.\nIn 1374 DR, the belt of Raumathar was worn by a Red Wizard of Thay, Khai Khmun, during his confrontation with the Kalach-Cha and Safiya in the Plane of Shadow echo of Mulsantir."
