        "mainbody": "A potion of growth was a magical potion that caused its drinker to temporarily grow to enormous size.\nPotions of growth were clear in color, with a small red bead suspended in the liquid that repeatedly expanded to color the entire contents of its vial and contracted again. This effect happened continuously and not even shaking the vial interrupted it.\nUpon drinking a potion of growth, the user gained the effects of an enlarge/reduce spell for a duration of between one and four hours.\nPaste of growth The people of Serôs had a thick, gelatinous paste version of this potion, suitable for use in their underwater environment. Like other pastes of Serôs, a paste of growth consisted of kelp and other viscous substances. It was stored in either clamshells or flexible tubes made from eelskin.\nthumb|Boo under the effect of a potion of growth.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the miniature giant space hamster Boo accidentally drank a potion of growth that had been dropped by Minsc and grew temporarily to the size of a giant space hamster."
