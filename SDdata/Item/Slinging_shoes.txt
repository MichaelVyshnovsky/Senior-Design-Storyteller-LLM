'''''Slinging shoes''''' were a pair of [[enchanted]] boots with some hits of sentience, created some time before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Slinging shoes'' possessed a simple enchantment that returned the boots back to their owner's feet. However, somehow, these boots showed a genius streak by kicking their owner in the ankles every time they wore slippers or high-heeled shoes. Unexpectedly, the same enchantment that made them return also made them a good thrown weapon, and when the boots hit a target, they dealt additional psychic damage. While wearing the boots, the wearer also gained a slight boost to their nimbleness and reaction.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of such ''slinging shoes'' belonged to [[Tara]], a [[tressym]] companion of the [[Waterdhavian]] [[mage]] [[Gale Dekarios]], who followed him to the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the [[Absolute crisis]]. She was ready to exchange the boots with a face friendly to Gale in exchange for some fresh [[fish]].
