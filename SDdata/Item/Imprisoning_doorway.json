Those that had spell or [[magic]] resistance were in no way resistant or immune to these effects.\n\nAnyone observing this nearby would simply see the creature disappear, as if it were entering a portal.",
        "Release": "These types of [[dread doorway]]s could only imprison a certain number of creatures. If the door went above its threshold, those that had been imprisoned the longest would be released. If any doorways were destroyed, they would release all the creatures it had taken in this manner."
