Those that had spell or magic resistance were in no way resistant or immune to these effects.\nAnyone observing this nearby would simply see the creature disappear, as if it were entering a portal.\nThese types of dread doorways could only imprison a certain number of creatures. If the door went above its threshold, those that had been imprisoned the longest would be released. If any doorways were destroyed, they would release all the creatures it had taken in this manner."
