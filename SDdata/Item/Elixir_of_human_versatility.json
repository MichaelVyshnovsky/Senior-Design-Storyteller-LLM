        "mainbody": "Elixirs of human versatility were potions created through sanguinous magic arts by Araj Oblodra of Crimson Draughts in the late 15 century DR.\nElixirs of human versatility were distilled from the blood of humans, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with human versatility – the ability to be universally proficient with most, if not skills, an adventurer would ever need. The blood-bound resourcefulness lost its effect in one day after imbibing.\nIn the , Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of humanss infected with the illithid tadpoles of the Cult of the Absolute to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in Moonrise Towers. After the death of Ketheric Thorm, she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of Baldurs Gate, where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments."
