        "mainbody": "'''''Elixirs of human versatility''''' were [[potion]]s created through sanguinous magic arts by [[Araj Oblodra]] of [[Crimson Draughts]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Elixirs of human versatility'' were distilled from the blood of [[human]]s, allowing the imbiber to adopt their racial abilities and properties. Once such a potion was consumed, it gifted the imbiber with ''human versatility'' – the ability to be universally proficient with most, if not skills, an adventurer would ever need. The blood-bound resourcefulness lost its effect in one day after imbibing.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Araj Oblodra, an [[alchemist]] and a Blood Vendor, was using the blood of [[humans]]s infected with the [[illithid]] tadpoles of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] to craft these potions during her stay with the cult in [[Moonrise Towers]]. After the death of [[Ketheric Thorm]], she returned to the Crimson Draughts – her apothecary in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], where she resumed her sanguinous magic experiments."
