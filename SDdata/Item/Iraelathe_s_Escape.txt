Iraelathes Escape was a unique set of potions held by Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn.
The set included a special silver case, which contained two square crystal vials with silver filigree. The vials contained a liquid that glowed blue-white under moonlight.
Iraelathes Escape was used to make one person appear as another to magical divination and mundane sight. To activate it, three hairs from the person to be hidden were tied around the finger of the person replacing them. Then, they each simultaneously drank a potion from the case. The person who gave up their hairs would have all but the most powerful divination instead lead to the other, who would also take on the physical appearance of the hidden one.
Once per month, when the case contained the empty vials and was bathed in the light of the moon, the potions would regenerate and be usable again.
The set was gifted to Moonshadow Hall in the 11 century DR by a devotee of Sel√ªne.
It was used by Julith Harkspur and Feena Archwood to divert attention from Feena as she avoided capture by the forces of the Hall.
