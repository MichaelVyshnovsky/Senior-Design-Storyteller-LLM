        "mainbody": "Mermaids breath was an alchemical draught used to revive the drowned.\nWhen applied into the mouth of a recently drowned person (no later than four minutes), it gave them a chance at reviving.\nThe synthesis of this concoction was extremely delicate, requiring both chemical and herbal knowledge in order to brew correctly. Hedge wizards often traded in it, stocking up if they were near bodies of water. It sold for about 1000 gold pieces."
