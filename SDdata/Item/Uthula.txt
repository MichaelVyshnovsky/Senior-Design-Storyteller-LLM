'''Uthula''' was a magical [[axe]] wielded by Lord [[Maiele Nierdre]] the leader of the [[gold elven]] [[House Nierdre]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, ''Uthula'' could be found in [[Leuthilspar]], on the isle of [[Evermeet]]. However, before the the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], centuries earlier, the [[enchanted]] axe was kept with House Nierdre in the City of Song of [[Cormanthor]].
