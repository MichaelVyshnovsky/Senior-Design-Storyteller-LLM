'''''Slow sand''''' was a powerful [[magical sand]] from [[Zakhara]] that literally had the power to stop time.{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}}

==Powers==
When thrown, this sand could affect up to three man-sized creatures so long as they stood within 10 feet (3 m) of each other, freezing each of them for up to 5 minutes similar to a ''[[hold person]]'' spell. Affected individuals entered a special stasis where they were unaffected by anything transpiring around them. A second handful of ''slow sand'' tossed on an individual in stasis increased the duration for one hour. Any creature able to resist the sand was merely slowed down for one minute.
