        "Description": "''Berserker axes'' usually were huge and deadly in combat.",
        "Powers": "These axes possessed a +1 enchantment and granted the wielder improved constitution. However, ''berserker axes'' were cursed. If the wielder succumbed to its influence in battle after being struck by an opponent, the wielder flew into a feral berserker rage, rampaging through the battlefield without differentiating between friend and foe. The berserk rage usually lasted until the wielder had no creatures they  could see or hear within {{SI|60'|'\"|long=yes}}. Another effect of the curse kept the attuned owner of the axe unwilling to part with the weapon.[[File:Berserker axe SCL.png|thumb|''[[Order of the Burning Dawn]]'s berserker axe.'']]Some of the ''berserker axes'' also granted the attuned user increased life energy and health.",
        "History": "The members of the [[Order of the Burning Dawn]] used the ''berserker axes'', and after the guild's almost complete destruction at the hands of the [[Knights of the Gilded Eye]], one of the ''berserker axes'' was left in the [[Burning Dawn Guild Hall]]'s armory in [[Luskan]]'s Market District ''circa'' [[1490 DR]]."
