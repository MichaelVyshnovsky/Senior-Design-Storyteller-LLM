The '''''Cloak of Mysteries''''' was an artifact of the [[Leiran]] faith from the [[Hidden House of Leira]] in [[Westgate]].

==Powers==
The ''Cloak of Mysteries'' was not just a festive religious garb, it also possessed a powerful ''+3'' [[enchantment]] that deflected harm from the wearer. Additionally, the item's magics gave the wearer innate knowledge and focus in ''[[illusion]]'' school of magics and dramatically increased their ability to bluff.

==History==
The Hidden House of Leira in Westgate's [[Undergate]], was a busy center of worship of the Lady of Deception. The ''Cloak of Mysteries'' was a celebrated ceremonial garb cherished by the [[Church of Leira]] and worn by high-ranking clerics during important festivals and ceremonies of the faith. When the goddess was believed to have been slain by god [[Cyric]], her temple in Westgate was abandoned and the ''Cloak of Mysteries'' â€“ lost, thought destroyed.

Unreality, the ''Cloak of Mysteries'' was hidden by the clerics of Leira within the trapped and illusion-filled abandoned Hidden House of Leira.
