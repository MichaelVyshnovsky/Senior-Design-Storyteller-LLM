        "mainbody": "singing bundle was the name given by the sahuagin to their own version of a book. Since they lived underwater, typical books were not an option, and sahuagin greatly feared magic, which logically meant they could not ensorcel books to keep them resistant to the elements.\nSinging bundles were made of bits of stone and shell stringed together with knots of sinew or on rings of bone. This book was not meant to be read with the eyes, but heard instead, for when the singing bundle was shaken or jerked, the knotted bits and pieces would click together in a series of sounds, in the fashion of the sahuagin language.\nThe clerical amulet of sahuagin priestesses of Sekolah used the same system, consisting of a circlet of shark teeth that chanted a prayer to Sekolah when shaken. Priestesses would address their prayers to Sekolah and shake the circlet before casting clerical spells.\nLaaqueel found a very old singing bundle when she stayed with the sea elves. Although it was written by Ronassic of Sigil, a human, and it contained many falsehoods, it surprisingly contained many truths as well. It was about an entity referred to as the \"One Who Swims With Sekolah\". This finding prompted her to try to locate him to prove her worth to the sahuagin despite her status as a malenti."
