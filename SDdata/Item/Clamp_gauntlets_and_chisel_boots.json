        "mainbody": "Clamp gauntlets and chisel boots were gnomish contraptions designed to aid in climbing surfaces.\nNarrow-tipped fingers and toes, combined with a ratcheted clamp mechanism, allowed a climber to usually find a handhold on most exterior surfaces made from wood or stone. These items were favored by thieves. Wearing clamp gauntlets or chisel boots during combat did negatively affect the wearers skill with their weapon and slowed them down.\nThese items could not be used effectively with other climbing equipment.\nClamp gauntlets and chisel boots cost 25 gold pieces for each pair through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue."
