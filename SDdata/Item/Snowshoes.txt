}}'''Snowshoes''' were a type of footwear common in arctic regions, and [[the North]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Snow Equipment}}

==Description==
Snowshoes were oval frames of wood, {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|1|ft}} wide, with a web-like layout

Those sold in ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' were typically constructed with [[duskwood]].

==Powers==
Snowshoes gave wearers the ability to walk upon the surface of snow, rather than having their feet sink within it. Thus they enabled a wearer to move faster and less impeded in arctic regions than normal footwear would allow.
