'''Hydrophane''' was a variety of [[opal]] that was highly prized by sailors and the [[aquatic creature|aquatic races]] of [[Faer√ªn]] because its true beauty was only visible when wet. 

==Description==
This [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] was typically used for inlay work or cut cabochon for jewelry. It was a rather plain, opaque, ivory or frosty-white color when dry, but when immersed in water it became transparent with a prism-like rainbow iridescence. A typical stone had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
Hydrophane was used in various potions and magic items related to water, especially those that allowed control over [[water elemental]]s or ''[[water breathing]]''. If used as an additional material component for the ''[[color spray]]'' spell, it decreased the chance that targets would resist the spell.
