        "Description": "Lassos were little more than lengths of [[rope]], typically thin, knotted with a slipknot at the end to create a large loop.",
        "Weaponology": "Lassos were used by simply twirling them in the air, then hurling them at a target and pulling the rope taut once the loop landed around their target.\n\nWithin this simple framework there was a variety tricks that could be done with lassos. They could be settled around a target's legs to trip them, settled around their necks to strangle, or settled about their torso and arms to pin them down. Though in the latter case, there was a chance a target might shrug the rope off before a wielder could pull their lasso taut.\nPeople were also known to settle lassos about a [[mount]]ed target's torso, bracing for impact as they pulled them to the ground off their mount.",
