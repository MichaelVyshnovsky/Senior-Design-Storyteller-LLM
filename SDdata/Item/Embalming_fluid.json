        "mainbody": "Embalming fluid, sometimes simply referred to as formaldehyde, or colloquially, \"everwater\", its major preserving agent, was a foul-smelling and toxic chemical used to embalm corpses for burial, interring rituals, or the creation of mummies.\nEmbalming fluid had a strong foul odor somewhat reminiscent of pickles.\nEmbalming fluid was the main ingredient of the mummy creation spell from the Old Empires. The corpse that was to become a mummy needed to be embalmed using 1,400 gold coins worth of formaldehyde and wrapped in bandages. The entire process took six hours.\nAmong the liquids more magical properties, a correctly mixed solution of embalming fluid and Keoghtoms ointment allowed certain monster bits to preserve their magics as well as tissues. One example being a beholders eye. When it was soaked in this solution it retained its anti-magic gaze for an indefinite time, making it a rare and valuable item to have.\nFor certain types of undead, embalming fluid could be used to restore a portion of their health and harden their dead tissues, temporarily increasing their defenses and hardiness.\nIn mid-14 century DR, Velsharoon-worshiping members of the Cult of the Dragon in the Chantry of St. Sammaster, on the northern slopes of Thunder Peaks, used embalming fluid for their dark unholy rituals.\nIn the late 14 century DR, embalming chemicals, simply labeled as \"formaldehyde\" were used in the mortuary mausoleum of Daggerford Graveyard to prepare deceased members of more well-off families to be interred in crypts and sarcophagi. The bottles of the embalming fluids were of blue and yellow color for the ease of identification and use. After embalming the wealthy corpses were made presentable via application of light makeup and blush and had two coins placed other eyes. Circa 1372 DR, funeral director Moris Olgrund was the primary person in charge of embalming the dead of Daggerford.\nIn the late 15 century DR, circa 1492 - 1494 DR, embalming fluid was used in the cemetery of Elturel. In the same century, embalming fluid was used to preserve bodies of previous Xanathars in the Xanathars lair.\nWorshipers of Velsharoon were known to use embalming fluids for their vile necromantic rituals in the catacombs and necropolises they gathered. Nauseating reek of formaldehyde was one of the telltale signs of the cultists presence, along with their undead servants.\nOutside the Prime Material plane, embalming liquid was used in abundance by the Dustmen of the city of Sigil inside its sprawling Mortuary."
