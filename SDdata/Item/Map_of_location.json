        "mainbody": "Maps of location were enchanted maps that were invaluable for naval vessel navigation and Aglarondan military commanders.\nEach map of location appeared to be a simple rolled-up sheet of parchment.\nMaps of location were used at sea. Once such an item was unrolled, it showed a naval map of the region relative to the users location. The map owners ship was marked with a moving icon on the map.\n*The Simbul, or the feared \"hedge wizard\" queen of Aglarond, was the supposed inventor of the maps of location. She created a number of these maps to be used by the countrys navy commanders sometime before the late 14 century DR.\n*High Autharch Blaze Mythalanir of Thay owned a map of location, kept in his private cargo aboard the Bounty. It was later presented as payment to adventurers of Ravens Bluff whod been tasked with escorting Mythalanir from the Living City to Bezantur in the late 14 century DR."
