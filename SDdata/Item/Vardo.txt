'''Vardos''',{{Cite trumpeter/1-3|2}} were a type of [[wagon]] used by [[gypsies]] in [[the Vast]] region of [[Faer√ªn]]{{Cite polyhedron/136/The House of Spice|19}}<ref group="note" name="gypsy">While it is not explicitly stated that "gypsies" use these "gypsy carts", gypsies have shown up in multiple [[Living City]] publications, cementing their existence in the Vast. and by the [[Vistani]] in the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Description==
These wagons were covered with curved roofs, often described as being "barrel-topped",

Vardos held great significance in Vistani culture, being viewed as symbols of prestige and signs of wealth. They were also important for providing Vistani with secure places to perform fortunetelling, [[scrying]], and [[spell component]] crafting.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Laurinda Brozik]], a [[Thesk]]ian fortuneteller in the [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]].<ref>
* [[Lela Moslavaric]], a Vistani of the [[w:c:ravenloft:Moslavaric|Moslavaric]] tribe.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Seer|12}}
* [[Sybil Rasia]], a [[Gur]] from [[Phlan]] who became trapped in [[Barovia]] for a time. While residing in that Demiplane of Dread she owned a brightly colored vardo adorned with images of red [[rose]]s.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Marionette|12}}
