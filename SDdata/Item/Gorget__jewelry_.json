Both their design and name were derived from the armor of the same name.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe) sold luxury one-size-fits-all gorgets in the \"Jewelry\" section of its catalogue for 50 gold pieces. These gorgets were filigreed of the finest gold and inset with Kozakuran pearls. They also had a silk fastening band, linen in coloration and of a jacquard weave, that were sewn by women in Sembia."
