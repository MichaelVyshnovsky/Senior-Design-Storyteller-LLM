The wand was crimson in color.\nThis wand allowed the user to cast the finger of death spell. Additionally, it dramatically enhanced the users charisma at the cost of reduced fortitude.\nIn 1369 DR, this crimson-colored rod could be found among treasures of a dark naga that laired in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor, along with a piece of the broken Orrery from the Speculum Grounds. The nagas treasure hoard also included  an idolon, a strange magical stone head, Kluusars Chain of Warding and an enchanted full plate armor."
