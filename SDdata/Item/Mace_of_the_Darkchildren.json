The mace-head was shaped like a skull with three screaming faces in each direction. It was forged of adamantine.\nThe mace of the darkchildren could be either a +1 or a +2 weapon. It was forged of adamantine, with all the strength of that metal.\nIn particular, the mace gave its wielder enhanced powers against undead, making them easier to control or rebuke, if the wielder was capable of that divine power. It also allowed them to control more undead than normal."
