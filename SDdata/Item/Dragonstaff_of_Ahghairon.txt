The '''''Dragonstaff of Ahghairon''''' was a powerful [[magic]] staff.

==Powers==
Any dragon touched by the ''dragonstaff'' became immune to the effects of ''[[Ahghairon's dragonward]]'' for a duration of time specified by the [[mage]] who controlled the staff. If a [[dragon]] was touched a second time, he was once again affected by the dragonward.

Additionally, the staff conferred several powers to its wielder. It had all the capabilities of a ''[[staff of power]]'' and could be used to cast the ''[[command]]'' [[spell]], which had additional compulsive power if used against any dragon or [[dragonkin]].

==History==
The ''dragonstaff'' was created by [[Ahghairon]] as a means to control and regulate the ''dragonward'' cast in [[1071 DR]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Lhoril Delhiirnyn]] stole the staff after Ahghairon's death in [[1256 DR]].
* [[Maaril]] The Dragon Mage took the staff from Lhoril after murdering her (sometime during his apprenticeship to her after [[1317 DR]]).
* [[Aurinax]] the [[gold dragon]] was given the staff by Maaril before he left the city (prior to [[1385 DR]])
* Sometime prior to [[1479 DR]], possibly during Aurinax's possession of the staff, it fell into the hands of the Open Lord, [[Dagult Neverember]], and the [[Blackstaff]], [[Samark Dhanzscul]]. They entrusted the staff to a noblewoman and [[Masked Lord]], [[Nazra Mrays]].
* The staff was returned to Aurinax in [[1492 DR]] in exchange for guarding a vault of gold that Dagult Neverember embezzled from Waterdeep during his time as the Open Lord.
