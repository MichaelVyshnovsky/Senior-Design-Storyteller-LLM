-century custodian, Aurinax.
The Dragonstaff of Ahghairon was a powerful magic staff.
Any dragon touched by the dragonstaff became immune to the effects of Ahghairons dragonward for a duration of time specified by the mage who controlled the staff. If a dragon was touched a second time, he was once again affected by the dragonward.
Additionally, the staff conferred several powers to its wielder. It had all the capabilities of a staff of power and could be used to cast the command spell, which had additional compulsive power if used against any dragon or dragonkin.
The dragonstaff was created by Ahghairon as a means to control and regulate the dragonward cast in 1071 DR.
* Lhoril Delhiirnyn stole the staff after Ahghairons death in 1256 DR.
* Maaril The Dragon Mage took the staff from Lhoril after murdering her (sometime during his apprenticeship to her after 1317 DR).
* Aurinax the gold dragon was given the staff by Maaril before he left the city (prior to 1385 DR)
* Sometime prior to 1479 DR, possibly during Aurinaxs possession of the staff, it fell into the hands of the Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, and the Blackstaff, Samark Dhanzscul. They entrusted the staff to a noblewoman and Masked Lord, Nazra Mrays.
* The staff was returned to Aurinax in 1492 DR in exchange for guarding a vault of gold that Dagult Neverember embezzled from Waterdeep during his time as the Open Lord.
