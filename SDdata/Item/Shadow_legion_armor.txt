'''''Shadow legion armors''''' were [[enchanted]] black [[leather armor]] sets that were believed to come from the hands of the infamous [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Amn]].

==Powers==
''Shadow legion armor'' had a potent ''+4'' enchantment that aided its wearers with hiding in shadows. And its pitch-black color did not hurt either.

==History==
''Shadow legion armor'' sets originated from Amn and were believed to be owned my elite members of the Shadow Thieves. Some of these armors were recovered after the events that the Thieves' were suspected in, however their involvement as well as the ownership of these expensive sets of leather armor were never confirmed.

By the late 15{{th}} century, these pitch-black leathers found their way into the hands of traders and professional criminals of the [[Sword Coast]] the [[Moonsea]] regions.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Elaith Craulnober]]: during his stay at the [[Alliance Arms Inn]] in [[Port Llast]] ''circa'' the [[Wailing Death]] epidemic of [[1372 DR]].
