        "Description": "This ''enchanted [[lute]]'' looked like it was through hells. The wood of the lute's body was worn down and spotted cracks. One of the larger ones was mended and splinters tied back to the instrument with a red thong. Another sign of repair could be seen on the lute's neck that was snapped off and mended in the past.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Calliope lute.jpg|thumb|''[[Calliope]] and her magic instrument.'']]\nBy playing this instrument, its owner could grant a beneficial boon on her allies, similar to that of the ''[[heroism]]'' spell.",
