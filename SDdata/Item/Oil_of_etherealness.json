        "mainbody": "Oil of etherealness was a magical substance that, when applied to a creature, gave them the effect of the spell etherealness. The oil affected the creature, the equipment it was wearing and belongings it was carrying. It took about 10 minutes to apply and lasted for on hour.\nThe oil appeared a cloudy gray, and the condensation would evaporate quickly from its vial.\n* Goldeyes, the specialty priests of Waukeen, had a chance of receiving some oil of etherealness as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
