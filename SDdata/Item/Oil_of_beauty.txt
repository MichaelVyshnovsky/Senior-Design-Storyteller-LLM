Oil of beauty was a magic oil that was used by priestesses of Ishtar of the Old Empires.
A mixture of olive oil, crushed pearl, and ash from the Plains of Purple Dust infused this item.
When applied to the skin, oil of beauty would greatly enhance the users physical beauty for 10 to 40 minutes. This did not compel those who beheld them to fall in love with them, but rather helped the wearer be well received.
