An '''instrument of illusions''' was a magical instrument that could be used to create simple [[Illusion|illusions]].

==Powers==
When an instrument of illusions was played, it could be used to create harmless, visual effects within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the instrument. [[Bards]] could create bigger illusions within 15 feet (4.5 meters). Examples of the visual effects that could be created include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow.

==Notable instruments==

*A '''lute of illusions''' was buried with the corpse of its former owner in a sarcophagus in the [[Dragon Barrow]].
