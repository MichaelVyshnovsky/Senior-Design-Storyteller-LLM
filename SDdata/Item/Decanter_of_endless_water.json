        "mainbody": "A '''''decanter of endless water''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] flask that could produce streams of [[water]] of different intensities.\n\n{{Quote|Now, remember: Under no circumstances should you utter the word 'geyser' in the same room asâ€•oh blast it!|[[Bindelhaim]], [[Baldurian]] merchant.{{Cite MTG|CLB|309|''[[decanter of endless water|Decanter of Endless Water]]''|[[Titus Lunter]]}}}}",
        "Description": "A typical ''decanter of endless water'' looked like an ordinary stoppered flask that produced a sound of sloshing water when shaken.",
        "Powers": "A user activated the decanter by unstoppering the flask and speaking a command word. There were three possible commands that a ''decanter of endless water'' accepted, each producing a different amount of fresh or salt water, depending on the user's choice. The command \"stream\" created {{SI|1|gal|l|long=yes}} of water; the command \"fountain\" generated {{SI|5|gal|l|long=yes}}; and the command \"geyser\" created a violent jet of {{SI|30|gal|l|long=yes}} of water that gushed out to a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, damaging and pushing back creatures and objects in the process, which lasted only for a few seconds.\n\nSome versions of the decanter produced a continuous flow that could only be stopped by the user speaking the command word again.",
        "Notable ''Decanters of Endless Water''": "A fountain located in the [[Shadowdusk Hold]] level of [[Undermountain]] was fueled by a ''decanter of endless water'' located within a statue of an [[aboleth]].\n\nThe private bath of the high priestess of the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]], [[Naneatha Suaril]], had water continuously supplied by a ''decanter of endless water'' built into the base of the pool. A secondary enchantment on the ''decanter'' allowed the water to be changed anywhere from freezing to boiling at but a touch.<ref>"
