        "mainbody": "'''''Talona's Tears''''' were [[enchanted]] [[Talonite]] thrown weapons, symbolic of the Mistress of Disease and Mother of All Plagues.",
        "Description": "These small chunks of [[amber]] could fit in one's hand. These stones emanated constant buzzing sounds from their cores.",
        "Powers": "When ''Talona's Tear'' was thrown, it shattered upon impact and from its core a deadly swarm of insects was unleashed to gnaw on everything in their way. This effect was similar to a powerful version of the ''[[creeping doom]]'' spell.",
        "History": "One of ''Talona's Tears'' was hidden deep inside a vault of the Temple of [[Bhaal]] in the town of [[Liam's Hold]], later known as the [[Stronghold (Liam's Hold)|Stronghold]]. The wondrous Talonite item was deposited there sometime before the temple's fall and abandonment during the [[Time of Troubles]]. As of [[1372 DR]], the ''Tear'' was still locked behind the vault's hidden door and guarded by three [[gargoyle]]s."
