        "mainbody": "A wyrmtooth dagger was a type of enchanted knife carved from a dragons tooth.\nWyrmtooth daggers were deadly weapons that could be enchanted to varying levels of power. Those struck with a solid blow found themselves stripped of any elemental resistances. Additionally, sorcerers could channel their magics through a wyrmtooth dagger to bypass these same resistances.\nThese daggers could be found from the Sword Coast to Tymanther. They were used by the frost giants of Kultaakarr and by members of the Cult of the Dragon.\n* Aldous Talbot, a Waterdhavian merchant active in the late 15 century DR."
