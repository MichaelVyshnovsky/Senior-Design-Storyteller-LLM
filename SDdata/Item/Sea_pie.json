        "mainbody": "'''Sea pie''' was a variety of savory pastry with a seafood filling, which originated from the coastal town of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "The pastry shell was made using [[bacon]]-fat dough, and was filled with a thick dark [[beef]]-base stew of [[potato]]es and diced aquatic creatures, such as [[skate]], [[squid]], and more. The filling was cooked for a long period until the [[fish]] flesh was soft and fell apart in the stew, then ladled into the dough crust and baked.",
        "History": "Sea pies were available from [[The Wight on a Waterdragon]], a crowded eatery of Marsember in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
