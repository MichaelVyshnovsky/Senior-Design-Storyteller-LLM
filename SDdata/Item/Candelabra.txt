'''Candelabra''', also known as '''Candelabrum''', were candleholders designed to hold multiple [[candle]]s. They could be found in many temples and other types of buildings across the Realms, serving both a decorative and religious function.

==Description==
Candelabra varied greatly in size, shape, the material used in their construction, and in the number of candles they could hold. They often ranged from holding four to sixteen candles.

==Availability==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold candelabras under its "Priest's Alcove" section made of either [[gold]] or [[silver]]. Those that could hold six candles sold for 35 gp and 20 gp respectively, while those that could hold twelve candles sold for 45 and 25 gp respectively.
* The [[Glow Shop]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] sold candleabras made of [[brass]] or [[iron]], but sometimes offered ones made of unusual or precious materials for a higher price.{{Cite polyhedron/48/The Living City: The Glow Shop|28}}
* [[Hillmarch]], a small mining town in northern [[Cormyr]], produced a great quantity of high-quality brass candelabras.

==Usages==
The spell ''[[Intensify summoning]]'' required a miniature, silver candelabra as a [[material component]].

==Notable Users==
* Candelabras were generally favored by various clerics and [[priest]]s.
===Businesses & Residences===
* The [[Cloak Tower]], a major [[wizard]] tower in [[Neverwinter]], lit many of its upper rooms with candelabras.
* [[Darroch Castle]], the residence of [[Neifion]] in the [[Feywild]],<ref> kept its foyer lit with a multitude of candelabra holding candles that burned green flames.
* The [[Peacock Resplendent]], a large inn in the city of [[Innarlith]], had hundreds of candelabra inside.
* The [[Shadowdark House]], a [[magic]] shop in [[Daerlun]], was dimly lit in part by candelabras that floated, had a scaly clawed fist as their centerpiece, and were [[animated object]]s.{{Cite dragon/287/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shadowdark House|70}}
