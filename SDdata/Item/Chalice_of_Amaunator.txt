The '''''Chalice of Amaunator''''' was a powerful and ancient [[Amaunatori]] [[artifact]]. It was considered a powerful weapon against the forces of darkness and the antithesis of anything related to the [[Shadow Weave]].

==Description==
The chalice was made from [[alabaster]], wrapped with bands of [[gold]] and inlayed with [[fire opal]]s, [[jacinth]]s, and [[topaz]]es. The sides of its bowl featured two removable seals, about the size of a [[currency|gold coin]], each inscribed with a sunburst that resembled [[Amaunator]]'s [[holy symbol]]. The chalice itself stood about two hand-widths tall.

==Powers==
The ''Chalice of Amaunator'' possessed several magical powers that could be evoked by anyone that held it. The chalice was a ''self-[[identify]]ing'' object; its wielder learned one of it's powers each minute until all were revealed. These revelations only occurred if both of the chalice's seals remained within their receptacles. It's powers included:

* Once per day, the chalice could drawn down ''[[sunbeam|destructive rays of sunlight]]'' from the skies above. In order to function, the bowl of the chalice had to be filled with some type of flammable solution.
* Once per month, the chalice could ''[[plane shift|transport its wielder and several others]]'' to another [[plane of existence]]. To accomplish this feat, the bowl of the chalice had to be filled with an unchanged substance found in the natural world.
* Approximately once per month, the bowl of the chalice could fill itself with ''[[liquid sun]]''. This substance held numerous potent properties in itself, including the ability to ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction|disjoin]]'' items, entities, or objects bound to the Shadow Weave.

==History==
The ''Chalice of Amaunator'' was created some time during the time of ancient [[Netheril]], an empire that collapsed over three centuries before [[Dale Reckoning]].

At some point, one of the chalice's seals was separated from the rest of the artifact. It somehow wound up within the [[Crypt of Augathra the Mad]].

During or after the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, a group of adventurers recovered the ''Chalice of Amaunator'' from [[Askilion's Tower]], in order to prevent [[Shadovar]] followers of [[Shar]] from uncovering until [[magic]]al secrets.

==Reputation==
It was said that the ''liquid sun'' produced by the ''Chalice of Amaunator'' could potentially melt down the ''[[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]]'', the golden tree that comprised one of the two sets of ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''. This could only be accomplished however, if the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar's creator, [[Tyvollus Aluviirsan]], released it from his protection.
