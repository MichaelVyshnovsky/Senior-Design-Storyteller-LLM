The Shadowstone was a powerful Shadow Weave heavy mace created by the goddess Shar.
The mace weighed 8 lb (3.6 kg), and radiated a strong necromancy and abjuration aura. The wielder of this magical item was protected as if they possessed a scarab of protection and they cast more powerful darkness spells. Individuals hit by this dark weapon could be struck blind. 
The Shadowstone was created by the goddess Shar, Mistress of the Night. She gave it to Damian Krale to aid him in uniting and leading the Sharran cells of the Western Heartlands.
