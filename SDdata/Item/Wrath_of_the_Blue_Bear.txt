The '''''Wrath of the Blue Bear''''' was one of the [[enchanted]] [[Uthgardt]] burial totems from the [[Stone Stand]].

==Description==
The ''Wrath of the Blue Bear'' was a small, oddly shaped statuette carved out of blue-gray stone to resemble the [[Blue Bear tribe]]'s totem beast rearing on its hind legs.

==Powers==
This particular Uthgardt burial totem allowed the owner to cast the ''[[animate dead]]'' spell once per day.

==History==
The Blue Bear tribe's burial totems were believed to be enchanted by the tribe's leader and [[shaman]], [[Tanta Hagara]], sometime before her death in [[1369 DR]]. Sages said that the totems could summon long-dead Blue Bear tribe warriors to defend the hidden ancestral treasures underneath the Stone Stand. Rumors of a [[curse]] or the wrath of the Blue Bear spirit prevented unwitting adventurers from stealing things from the burial mounds.

Sometime before [[1372 DR]], when most believed the Blue Bear tribe to be extinct, the ''Wrath of the Blue Bear'' was stolen from the Stone Stand and found its way to the [[Sword Coast]]. It moved through the hands of several collectors. The totem's last owner was [[Vladmyr]], a shady curio trader from [[Daggerford]]. He tasked the [[Hero of Daggerford]] with tracking down and recovering several pieces for his collection. These items were lost while transported in an unsecured trading wagon through an especially bumpy patch of the [[Trade Way]]. After falling out of the wagon they were swept away from the road by a rainstorm. The ''Wrath of the Blue Bear'' was found by some unfortunate person who met his doom at the fangs of [[dire spider]]s and [[ettercap]]s within the [[Brush of Barbs]]. Some believed that surviving members of the  Blue Bear tribe sought the item in order to return it to its rightful place.
