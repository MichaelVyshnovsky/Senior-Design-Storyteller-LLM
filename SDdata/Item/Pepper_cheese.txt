'''Pepper cheese''' was a spicy [[cheese]] from [[Tethyr]]. It was available for purchase from ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

==Description==
Pepper cheese consisted of a mixture of [[goat]] and [[cow]] cheese, mixed with southern [[spices]]. The rind was covered with peppercorns, which gave the cheese its unique appearance.

The spicy and tangy flavor of this cheese provided a good pairing with southern dishes.
