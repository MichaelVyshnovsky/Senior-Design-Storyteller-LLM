Genie slayer swords were magic weapons found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, that specialized in harming genies.
Though most commonly found as scimitars, any type of sword could be enchanted with "genie slaying" properties.
Genie slayer swords made it much easier for the wielder to strike and harm any opponent. When facing any form of genie this power was amplified even further. Additionally, each genie slayer sword was enchanted to cause even more harm to a specific type of genie.
