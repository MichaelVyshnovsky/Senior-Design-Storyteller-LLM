The '''Maze Engine''' was a powerful [[artifact]] capable of reshaping reality itself. [[Modron]]s called it '''The Orderer''', as its function was to bring order to chaos. It resembled an enormous working model of the [[Great Wheel]].

==Powers==
As it was capable of altering the fabric of reality, its possible uses were virtually infinite. Some examples of its effects included destroying [[magical item]]s, transporting creatures back in time, restoring the dead to life, summoning extraplanar beings such as [[slaad]]s, creating [[gem]]stones, casting the ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell, playing music, and more.

Once activated, it could be shut down by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or by coming into contact with an ''[[antimagic field]]''.

==History==
The Maze Engine lay deep within the [[Labyrinth]] in the [[Northdark]], and was sought by the [[beholder]] [[Karazikar]] after the creature learned about it from a captured modron.<ref name=OOA175>

''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the Maze Engine became damaged when a chasm opened up beneath it. Soon after, it was found by the [[demon lord]] [[Baphomet]]. He subsequently put the [[nalfeshnee]] [[Slaughtertusk]] to guard it while he went hunting for his rival, [[Yeenoghu]].
