'''''Torm's Tiny Circlet''''' was a unique magic [[ring]], part of the ''Fading Rings'' set, that bore the name of [[Torm]], the Hand of Righteousness.

==Description==
''Torm's Tiny Circlet'' was a thin band with tiny inlaid [[diamond]]s.

==Powers==
This ''Fading Ring'' possessed an enchantment that increased the wearer's constitution at the price of reduced initiative. Additionally, the ring had the ability to cast ''[[dominate person]]'' at high proficiency.

==History==
By [[1369 DR]], ''Torm's Tiny Circlet'' could be found in the possession of a mysterious monument, ''the Great Stone Head''. The statue was located in the [[Nightingale Court]] district of [[Myth Drannor]]. In exchange for one of the ''[[eidolon]]s'', small totem-like statuettes depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings. ''Torm's Tiny Circlet'' was one of the rings the monument produced.
