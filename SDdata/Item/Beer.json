        "Description": "Beer was a very popular beverage that was consumed all over [[Faerûn]]., though lager was much rarer than ale. Whilst ale was both flavorful and colorful, lager was light in both weight and color, and was often bland.",
        "Uses": "Beer was often consumed for enjoyment, as well as its intoxicative effects. It could be bought at many establishments, where it could either be consumed within, or purchased to take away. In pubs, beer was usually sold in [[mug]]s. In other places, such as shops, beer could be found in bottles, [[hand keg]]s, [[cask]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[butt]]s, and [[tun]]s. Depending on its volume, beer could sell from a few [[copper piece]]s to several [[gold piece]]s.",
        "Trivia": "* \"Gulletfire\" was a slang term in [[Common]] for beer or [[wine]] of a very bad or poor quality.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Realms Slang}}"
