Whilst ale was both flavorful and colorful, lager was light in both weight and color, and was often bland.\nBeer was often consumed for enjoyment, as well as its intoxicative effects. It could be bought at many establishments, where it could either be consumed within, or purchased to take away. In pubs, beer was usually sold in mugs. In other places, such as shops, beer could be found in bottles, hand kegs, casks, barrels, butts, and tuns. Depending on its volume, beer could sell from a few copper pieces to several gold pieces.\n* \"Gulletfire\" was a slang term in Common for beer or wine of a very bad or poor quality."
