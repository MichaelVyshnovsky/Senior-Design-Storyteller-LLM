'''''Storm armor''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] set of [[light armor]] from the [[City of Brass]] in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Powers==
''Storm armor'' possessed a powerful ''+3'' enchantment that shielded the wearer from harm. Additionally, it granted them resistance to fire and sonic energy, and limited resistance to magic [[spell]]s.

==History==
This set of armor was crafted by a renowned [[brass]]worker name [[Gisnervi]] in the planar City of Brass sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. ''Storm armor'' was intended to be a gift for the son of the city's sultan. When the armor was being delivered to its new owner, Gisnervi's enemies intercepted the package and ''[[curse]]ed'' the armor. When the curse was discovered, Gisnervi was disgraced and banished to the [[Prime Material plane]]. Subsequently, Gisnervi's new friend, a smith from [[Neverwinter]] named [[Samir]], was able to remove the ''curse'' from the ''storm armor''.

By 1372 DR, ''storm armor'' found its way into the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]], underneath the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]].
