Rods of beguiling were enchanted rods that could calm and charm even the angriest creatures.
Rods of beguiling were beautifully crafted oaken devices sometimes decorated with a couple of gemstones.
These rods allowed the wielder to cast charm person and dominate person spells. An average rod of beguiling held fifty charges and each use of the charm person spell exhausted one charge, while dominate person - two.

In the late 14 century DR, these rods could be found throughout the Sword Coast region, notably in the cities of Neverwinter and sold by an imp Boonmoppet in Daggerfords Western Farmlands.
