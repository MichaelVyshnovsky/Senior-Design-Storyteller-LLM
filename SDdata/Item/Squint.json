        "mainbody": "Squint was an enchanted spyglass found in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nSquint was a small collapsible tube with carved gem lenses. It was bound in golden metal and wrapped in a bright purple ribbon, forming a trellis pattern.\nApart from the ingenuity of lenses allowing the user to see distant objects up close, Squint possessed an enchantment that allowed the viewer to place the eyebite spell on the target as well as disarm them for a brief time.\n* Calliope, a bard adventurer, owned Squint during her time working with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR. She always mentioned that when she looked through the gadget, she felt like an giant angry one-eyed idol from some far off temple.\nVideo Games\nWarriors of Waterdeep\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryWondrous items\nCategoryItems from Waterdeep\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast North\nCategoryItems from Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nql3ovwxtkf1psbn41gqmhpwgzvysd4i"
