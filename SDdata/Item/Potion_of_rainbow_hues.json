Doing so their skin tone would take on that very hue. The imbiber could virtually any color or combination.\nThese potions typically had enough liquid within for seven swigs, each lasting a period of one hour. Alternatively, one could swallow the entire potion to obtain its effect for a full seven hours.\nIn the 14 century DR, a traveling mercantile store in the Mooney And Sons Circus known as Glitzs And Klaxs Potions And Philters would sell potions that had one-tenth their normal power. This included potions of rainbow hues.\nA feather from the golden tail of a simurgh could be used as an ingredient in potions of rainbow hues. As well as water that had been exposed to a rainbow.\n* Frank DeWilson\n* Salokin Bayrat"
