The '''tui-fa''', also known as the '''tonfa''' ({{Pronounce|tohn|fah|refs=}}), was a weapon unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
A tui-fa was a hardwood rod with a small off-center handle protruding from its side. Spanning a length of approximately {{SIrange|2|3|ft|c|long=yes}}, it was originally a millstone handle but has since evolved into a martial arts implement. 

With the tui-fa, a skilled practitioner could proficiently engage in blocking, weapon interception, weapon destruction, and effective offensive maneuvers. It was often used in regions where conventional weapons were prohibited or restricted.

===Classes===
* Both [[shugenja]] and [[wu jen]] were known to utilize the tui-fa.
