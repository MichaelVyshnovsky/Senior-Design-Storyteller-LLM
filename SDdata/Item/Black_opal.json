        "mainbody": "'''Black opal''' was a dark version of [[opal]] found in ancient active or dormant hot springs.",
        "Description": "This stone had a dim greenish matrix with blotches of black and flashes of gold. It was usually smoothed by tumbling and cut cabochon. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "Black opals had an affinity for force effects and could be used in the creation of [[wands]] that were particularly good at delivering [[:Category:Force spells|force spells]]. If powdered and mixed with crushed [[orl]], it formed a powerful explosive that could be touched off by an open flame, if done properly. The blast was extremely devastating to anything within 10 ft (3 m) and could still do significant damage to creatures and objects up to 30 ft (9.1 m) away.\n\nOne recipe for a ''[[Helm of darkness]]'' called for thirty-six black opals and a [[black sapphire]].",
        "Trivia": "Calling a [[rogue]] (or anyone who operated in the shadows, away from the spotlight) \"black as a black opal\" was an ironic way of saying that they had a good heart without causing them too much embarrassment.\n\nBack opals were considered a prized gem among the drow. It was actually one of their favorites.\n\nThe [[drow]] deity [[Vhaeraun]] showed his pleasure or displeasure by making his followers stumble on or change the quality of a black opal in their possession.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|9, 15}}"
