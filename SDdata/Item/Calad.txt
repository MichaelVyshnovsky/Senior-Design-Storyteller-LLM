'''Calad''' was a [[poison]] that was available in many places across [[Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
This opaque fluid had a hue that resembled liquid gold. It was distilled from the brain juices of [[basilisk]]s, [[catoblepas]], and [[disenchanter]]s.

==Effects==
Upon ingesting, the victim experienced a disorienting degradation in vision and hearing. This poison also corroded the victim's internal organs. Both effects did not last long, but rendered the victim vulnerable and damaged.
