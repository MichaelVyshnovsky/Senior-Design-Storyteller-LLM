The Four from Cormyr was a set of powerful magical items created by the Obarskyr dynasty. It consisted of the Seal of Iron, Silveredge, Deathsend, and Fireblood.
The Seal of Iron was a bronze disk that made the bearer fearless.
Silveredge was a decorated bastard sword of sharpness.
Deathsend was a +4 dagger that could only be used in honorable combat, or merciful executions.
Fireblood was a brilliant ruby that made the bearer immune to all forms of fire.
Silveredges scabbard had a small sheath for storing Deathsend and a slot that held the Seal of Iron. Fireblood was intended to be be fitted into the pommel of Silveredge itself.
When all four items were combined and borne by the same person, additional powers were bestowed that rivaled that of a lesser artifact. The wielder gained a significant boost to their ability to fight, and could heal once per day. Their allies gained a smaller improvement to their combat strength, and also found themselves far more fearless than usual.
The Four from Cormyr were originally created by (or on behalf of) the royal Obarskyr family, but came to be scattered across Cormyr centuries before the 14 century DR. The set was reassembled in the  by adventurers who obtained the individual items from the lich Adzerak of Barrenstone, Lord Partic Thistle of Thistleflame Keep, the ruins of Orvaskyte Keep, and the Tower of Ruin. In the process, they investigated an old rhyme tied to it provided by the bard Mendryll Belarod.
The items came together in the ruins of Darkenshield as Lord Vorik Aris began his campaign of raiding the Stonelands with his personal army. By invoking the Four from Cormyrs ties to the realm, the ghostly remains of the disgraced Starburst Swords Purple Dragons were summoned to battle against the traitorous noble, earning their passage to the afterlife.
After these events, Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle of Tilverton requested that the Cormyrean relics be turned over for safekeeping.
