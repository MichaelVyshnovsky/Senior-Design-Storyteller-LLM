The '''''Four from Cormyr''''' was a set of powerful [[magical item]]s created by the [[Obarskyr]] dynasty. It consisted of the ''[[Seal of Iron]]'', ''[[Silveredge]]'', ''[[Deathsend]]'', and ''[[Fireblood]]''.

==Description==
The ''Seal of Iron'' was a bronze disk that made the bearer fearless.

''Silveredge'' was a decorated [[bastard sword]] of ''[[Sword of sharpness|sharpness]]''.

''Deathsend'' was a ''+4 [[dagger]]'' that could only be used in honorable combat, or merciful executions.

''Fireblood'' was a brilliant [[ruby]] that made the bearer immune to all forms of fire.

''Silveredge's'' scabbard had a small sheath for storing ''Deathsend'' and a slot that held the ''Seal of Iron''. ''Fireblood'' was intended to be be fitted into the pommel of ''Silveredge'' itself.

==Powers==
When all four items were combined and borne by the same person, additional powers were bestowed that rivaled that of a lesser [[artifact]]. The wielder gained a significant boost to their ability to fight, and could ''[[heal]]'' once per day. Their allies gained a smaller improvement to their combat strength, and also found themselves far more fearless than usual.

The ''Four from Cormyr'' were originally created by (or on behalf of) the royal Obarskyr family, but came to be scattered across [[Cormyr]] centuries before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The set was reassembled in the {{yearlinkName|1369}} by [[adventurer]]s who obtained the individual items from the [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] of [[Barrenstone]], Lord [[Partic Thistle]] of [[Thistleflame Keep]], the ruins of [[Orvaskyte Keep]], and the [[Tower of Ruin]]. In the process, they investigated an old rhyme tied to it provided by the [[bard]] [[Mendryll Belarod]].

The items came together in the ruins of [[Darkenshield]] as Lord [[Vorik Aris]] began his campaign of raiding the [[Stonelands]] with his personal army. By invoking the ''Four from Cormyr's'' ties to the realm, the ghostly remains of the disgraced [[Starburst Swords]] [[Purple Dragons]] were summoned to battle against the traitorous noble, earning their passage to the afterlife.

After these events, Lady Regent [[Alasalynn Rowanmantle]] of [[Tilverton]] requested that the Cormyrean relics be turned over for safekeeping.
