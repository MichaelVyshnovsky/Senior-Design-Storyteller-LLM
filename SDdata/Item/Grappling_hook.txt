'''Grappling hooks''' were a type of tool used to secure [[rope]]s for the purpose of climbing.

==Description==
Their rigid hooks were typically made of either two, three, or four welded together cast [[iron]] bars. Though hooks that could be folded flat were known to exist, they tended to cost roughly twice as much as a standard hook.

==Weaponology==
Hooks were designed to be thrown and secured on protrusions, thereby allowing rope to support a climber's weight.

The intended use for grappling hooks was simply to make climbing easier and safer.<ref> However, [[thieves]] took advantage of the tool and over time it became considered a crucial tool in their line of work.

==Varieties==
A fold-able, single-pronged version of the grappling hook was included in a rope set sold by [[Aurora's Emporium]] in its "Thieves' Corner" assortment.

One type of grappling hook was the [[Griffon's claw (grappling hook)|griffon's claw]], which possessed a [[magic]]ally strong grasp.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}
