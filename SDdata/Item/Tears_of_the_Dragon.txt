The Tears of the Dragon were artifacts created when the gold dragon Tlanchass wept for Archveult Tattercloak the wizard in .
Each tear was a clear object of unknown composition, apparently indestructible, roughly the size of a hand, and with a silky feel and a teardrop shape. They gathered and stored light, releasing a faint, minty-green luminence at all times. They released a ringing note when struck or dropped it was so sad, it moved even an archmage who knew nothing of their story to tears.
As per Azuth, those carrying a tear were protected against any effect that drained their life energy, or possessed them, or that threatened to shock their system to the point of death.
The tears were known to, on contact, heal insanity and other damage to the mind revert scarring and disfigurement end diseases, even those such as lycanthropy and mummy rot break mental influences from spells and heal large amounts of damage every time. Once a tenday, they could act as a potion of vitality. Once a year per being, they could be used to contact their patron deity, and commune for up to five answers.
When Tlanchass wept over Ravens Bluff for the death of her beloved, Archveult Tattercloak, in the , the tears were found on the ground, sparkling and gleaming, as bright as diamonds. Within a day, however, the mage Muaralygrym sent his gargoyles out across the city and had them snatch every single one of them. This act earned him the attention of Inhil Lauthdryn, the Magister at the time, who sought him out and battled him neither was seen again after their fight, with the next Magister, Aralagath Tarsil, confirming their deaths.
However, Azuth was known to have shown a tear to a later Magister. Seventy tears were thought to exist.
