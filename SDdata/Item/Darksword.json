        "mainbody": "The '''''darkswords''''', also called '''''Melegaunt's darkblades''''', were a collection of twenty enchanted [[longsword]]s given by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] to [[Bodvar the Black]] of [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|81}} They were wielded by Bodvar's descendants in defense of the [[Granite Tower]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}",
        "Description": "The ''darkswords'' were perfectly balanced longswords crafted entirely from shining black glass that was as hard as [[steel]]. The blades seemed impossibly smooth and never dulled with use.{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|83}}\n\nEach ''darksword'' became bonded to the lineage of a certain family within the Granite Tower. While all twenty of the ''darkswords'' were physically identical, they could develop individual personality quirks and powers based on their family. While the ''darkswords'' were not sentient, these personality quirks could range from encouraging lustful behavior to mumbling to themselves at night, humming tunes during battle, craving to be dipped in alcohol, or releasing wispy shadows when swung.\n\nThe ''darkswords'' had been given to these families as part of a pact between Bodvar the Black and Melegaunt Tanthul of the [[Shade Enclave]]. As each new generation took up their ''darksword'', it was understood that they too were bound by this pact to the [[Netherese]] [[wizard]].",
        "Powers": "The ''darkswords'' were designed to be supernaturally precise, and could cut through any [[Weave]]-based defenses that an enemy might be using. Magical armor and shields offered no special protection against a ''darksword'', and the blades passed straight through protective [[spells]] and [[Ward|wards]]. The ''darkswords'' were also devastating against creatures of [[shadow]].\n\nA ''darksword'' could only be held by a member of the family to which it was bonded (or by Melegaunt Tanthul). To anyone else, the swords were excruciatingly cold to the touch, and in some cases this was true for those on the receiving end of the blade. Members of the family could also call their ''darksword'' to their hands, which would [[fly]] to them from anywhere on the same [[plane]].\n\nIn addition, each ''darksword'' had the capacity to develop unique powers suited to the quirks of the family to which it was bonded. For example, the ''darksword'' of the [[Vala Thorsdotter|Thorsdotter]] family allowed for limited [[clairvoyance]] within the living quarters of the Granite Tower.",
        "History": "The ''darkswords'' were created in the {{YearlinkName|1269}}, by Melegaunt Tanthul, a [[Prince of Shade]], using blood magic and the [[Shadow Weave]]. He crafted the blades in order to tempt Bodvar the Black, the chieftain of the [[Moor Eagle]] tribe of Vaasa, into making an oath to serve him. Melegaunt recognized that life in Vaasa was hard and dangerous, and so offered Bodvar a deal: in exchange for the twenty magical ''darkswords'' and a fortress to call their own, his clan would send their twenty best warriors to aid Melegaunt at some unspecified time in the future. Bodvar was wary of the evil wizard, but when an attack on his people necessitated that his warriors take up the ''darkswords'' to defend themselves, the pact was sealed. Bodvar himself only took up the final sword in anger to avenge the death of his pregnant wife. \n\nThe original nineteen wielders of the blades, aside from Bodvar who had claimed Melegaunt's own ''darksword'' as his, underwent a rapid transformation upon first grasping the swords in which their hair turned white and their eyes turned black. This transformation completed the ''darkswords''<nowiki/>' enchantments and bonded each sword to that warrior's lineage. Melegaunt then fulfilled his promise of a fortress by erecting the Granite Tower before the end of the year, and ultimately left the tribe to head west.\n\nA century later, in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Melegaunt called on the clan to fulfill their pact and assist him at [[Evereska]]. They dispatched twenty warriors, led by [[Vala Thorsdotter]] wielding her family's ''darksword''.\n\nOver the course of the next century, the descendants of these families and bearers of the ''darkswords'' came to be known as the [[Scions of the Granite Tower]], and saw it as their duty to use the blades to defend their home and clan. They trained from a young age to wield their ''darkswords'', and rarely were seen without them when they ventured out on patrol.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Bodvar the Black]] was the original recipient of the ''darkswords'' and the first member of the Moor Eagle clan to wield one.\n*[[Melegaunt Tanthul]] was the original creator of the twenty ''darkswords''. He weilded the first of the ''darkswords'', but gifted it to Bodvar. Later, he wielded a [[dagger]] with the same properties.\n*[[Vala Thorsdotter]] was a great-granddaughter of Bodvar whose ''darksword'' facilitated her more lascivious urges by allowing her to spy on people within the Granite Tower.\n*[[Dexon]] was the wielder of a ''darksword'' which talked in its sleep in the mid-to-late 14{{Th}} century [[DR]]. He journeyed to Evereska with Vala and Melegaunt, but declined to return to the Granite Tower once the quest was over.\n*[[Kuhl]] was the wielder of a [[cursed]] ''darksword'' which made its user vulnerable to the influence of the [[Shadow Weave]]. It would also lose its luster if not immersed in [[mead]] at least once a day. After Kuhl's death in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, his sword came into the possession of the [[elf]] [[Takari Moonsnow]] and was presumably passed on to their [[half-elf]] child."
