The '''''coiled dragon''''' was a magical chalice. It was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.

==Description==
Carved in the shape of a [[dragon]] coiled around the bowl, the vessel was huge at 1 foot (30.48&nbsp;cm) wide, but it was very shallow.

==Powers==
When filled with liquid silver (that is, [[Wikipedia:Mercury (element)|mercury]]) and a single drop of blood from the one who would use it, the pool of silver became a mirror revealing any sight in [[Kara-Tur]] from the perspective of the [[Celestial Heavens]] above. Through concentration, the viewer could direct the mirror to anywhere in the land, whether to seek something out to or to spy.

==History==
As perhaps the greatest of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''coiled dragon''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo.

History recorded the [[Chinhan]] people as the last to hold the ''coiled dragon'' in around the 7th century before [[Dalereckoning]], but it had been lost for two millennia by the 14th century [[DR]].
