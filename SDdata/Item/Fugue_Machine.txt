The Fugue Machine was a magic item that was powered by beings from the Fugue Plane. It was used by Red Wizards of Thay in the late 15 century DR to protect their fortress in the Thunder Peaks.
The Fugue Machine was a sphere made from crystal that was  across encircled by spinning rings made from adamantine. The device was both magical and mechanical, and was built to contain a portal to the Fugue Plane. It siphoned beings from the Fugue Plane into itself, and converted their energy its power source. It was installed in the top of the tallest tower of the fortress, in a room with a domed roof made from glass.
The Fugue Machine enveloped the fortress in a massive etherealness effect. The Red Wizards and their allies used the machine to enter into the ethereal plane at will. It was practically indestructible, and could only be damaged when attacked in the ethereal plane by magical means.
When damaged, the machine could produce a number of unpredictable and violent magical effects.
The Fugue Machine was created by a particular unnamed lich of the Red Wizards of Thay, who wore bracers of defense that were shaped like evening gloves and made from red satin. When the Red Wizards attempted to raise the dracolich Shargrailar in the late 15 century DR, the Fugue Machine was employed to defend their fortress. It was operated by its creator and guarded by a number of dangerous creatures, including an ultroloth and multiple stone golems.
