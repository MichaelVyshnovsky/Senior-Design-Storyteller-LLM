        "mainbody": "auntlets of the valorous were magical gauntlets that were created for the heroes of Myth Drannor.\nThese gauntlets were made in a wide variety of appearances, ranging from huge silvery gauntlets that extended to the elbows to five rings for fingers and thumb chain linked by chains to a bracelet.\nA single gauntlet of the valorous had the power of a +3 gauntlet. They offered no protective ability, but did not affect spellcasting ability.\nTypically, only one gauntlet from a pair was located, but when both were found and used together, an additional spell-like power was possible. These were chain lightning, flame blade, heal, hold monster, polymorph other, regenerate, repulsion, shocking grasp, stone to flesh or flesh to stone, or telekinesis.\nA single gauntlet would fetch around 18,000 gold pieces, but a pair could increase in value up to around 85,000 gold pieces depending on the powers they had.\nFRGantelets du valeureux\nCategoryGauntlets\nCategoryPlus-3 items\nCategory15000-19999 gold pieces\nCategory30000-39999 gold pieces\nCategory40000-49999 gold pieces\nCategory50000-59999 gold pieces\nCategory60000-79999 gold pieces\nCategory80000-99999 gold pieces\nCategoryItems from Myth Drannor\nCategoryItems from North Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nbc9nerajboda78kf3gdx8iak0epez84"
