        "mainbody": "'''''Gauntlets of the valorous''''' were [[magic]]al [[gauntlet]]s that were created for the heroes of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "These gauntlets were made in a wide variety of appearances, ranging from huge silvery gauntlets that extended to the elbows to five rings for fingers and thumb [[chain]] linked by chains to a bracelet.",
        "Powers": "A single ''gauntlet of the valorous'' had the power of a ''+3 [[gauntlet]]''. They offered no protective ability, but did not affect spellcasting ability.\n\nTypically, only one gauntlet from a pair was located, but when both were found and used together, an additional [[spell]]-like power was possible. These were: ''[[chain lightning]]'', ''[[flame blade]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[polymorph other]]'', ''[[regenerate]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', ''[[shocking grasp]]'', ''[[stone to flesh]]'' or ''[[flesh to stone]]'', or ''[[telekinesis]]''.\n\nA single gauntlet would fetch around 18,000 [[gold piece]]s, but a pair could increase in value up to around 85,000 gold pieces depending on the powers they had.",
