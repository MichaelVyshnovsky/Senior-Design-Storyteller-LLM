Wands of arcane disjunction were powerful wands that could remove magics and enchantments from their targets.
These wands were enchanted with spells that could dispel magic. Each use of the wand exhausted two charges, and at maximum, a wand could hold up to fifty charges.
As of the late 14 century DR, wands of arcane disjunction were a topic of heated discussion among sorcerers and wizards. Commonly, these wands were sold by enchanters to adventurers and militiamen only to be used to kill and harm fellow spellcasters. Many considered the wands in poor taste and found it disturbing that some wizards created items so deadly to their kin. Regardless of the sentiment, wands of arcane disjunction were in high demand, and merchants who sold them were only happy as heated discourse only bolstered sales.
Im the , a magical curio store â€“ Mintassans Mysteries of Westgate, was in possession of one of these wands.
