'''''Bracers of artifice''''' were powerful [[enchanted]] [[bracers]] created by the ancient [[Imaskari]].

==Description==
Despite their simple unassuming appearance, these [[copper]] bracers held powerful defensive magics.

==Powers==
The wearer of a set of ''bracers of artifice'' received a magical defense identical to that of a set of full [[plate armor]] but with no drawbacks. The bracers only weighed a fraction of plate mail's weight and imposed no restrictions on the wearer's gesticulations, making them perfect defensive items for [[mage]]s. In addition to protection, ''bracers of artifice'' boosted the wearer's focus, allowing [[sorcerer]]s to collect arcane energies more effectively and wizards to memorize an additional spell from the 8{{th}} circle of magic per day. Lastly, ''bracers of artifice'' granted the wearer minor resistance to magic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''bracers of artifice'' could be found on the wrists of [[Red Wizards of Thay]] at the [[Academy of Shapers and Binders]].
