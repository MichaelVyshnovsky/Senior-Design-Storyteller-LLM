The '''''Eye of Vecna''''' was a powerful and [[evil]] [[artifact]] that granted its wearer supernatural senses and access to powerful [[spell]]s.

==Description==
The ''Eye'' was bloodshot and appeared to have been forcefully torn from its socket. In order to use its powers, the wielder needed to remove an eye and place the artifact into the empty socket. The item then magically grafted itself onto its wearer's head, assuming a golden coloration and a vertical pupil similar to a [[cat]]'s. Removing the ''Eye of Vecna'' invariably killed its wearer.

==Powers==
Once attuned to the ''Eye of Vecna'', a creature changed its worldview towards a [[neutral evil]] disposition. The artifact granted [[truesight]] to its wearer, as well as an ability to see through solid objects similar to that of a ''[[ring of X-ray vision]]'', including the risk of exhaustion in case of repeated activations.

In addition, the ''Eye of Vecna'' allowed its wearer to cast the ''[[clairvoyance]]'', ''[[crown of madness]]'', ''[[disintegrate]]'', ''[[dominate monster]]'', and ''[[eyebite]]'' spells a limited number of times. It progressively regained its magic at every dawn. Using the artifact to cast any spells incurred a small risk of [[Vecna]] himself tearing the wearer's soul apart, devouring it, and taking control of the wearer's body, using it as a puppet.

If both the ''Eye'' and the ''Hand'' were to be attuned to the same creature, the wearer enjoyed numerous additional benefits, such as immunity to [[disease]] and [[poison]], premonitions of imminent danger, the ability to use the ''Eye's'' X-ray vision without risking exhaustion, regeneration powers, and the ability to cast ''[[wish]]'' once every 30 days.

==History==
The ''Eye of Vecna'' and the ''[[Hand of Vecna]]'' were the only remnants of the powerful [[lich]] Vecna, after he was betrayed and killed by his lieutenant [[Kas]]. The two appendages were left with a fragment of the lich's will and attempted to work his deeds wherever they went.

==Reputation==
It was said that the only way to permanently destroy the ''Eye of Vecna'' was if both the ''Eye'' and the ''Hand of Vecna'' were attached to the same creature, and then that creature was slain by the artifact known as the ''[[Sword of Kas]]''. Any other attempt to destroy either artifact merely transported it into a hidden vault in an unknown location.
