'''Jargoon''' was a rare variety of [[zircon]] found in the Realms.{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|19}}<ref group="note">The name jargoon was often incorrectly used to describe an assortment of gems, particularly by those of the [[pirate]] persuasion (as in "a cluster of jargoons, matey, with [[garnet (gem)|garnets]] as big as your hand").

==Description==
Jargoons were valued for their resemblance to deep red [[ruby|rubies]] in color and luster. A typical specimen had a base value of 100&nbsp;gp.

==Powers==
One powerful use of this gemstone was as a ''[[magic missile]]'' enhancer. The caster held a jargoon in a hand and cast ''magic missile'' through it. This caused the jargoon to explode, but the number of missiles was doubled with no alteration in targets, damage, range, ''etc.'' The drawback was that the explosion damaged the caster's hand as if struck by a single particularly strong ''magic missile''.

==Rumors and Legends==
An unproven legend stated that a jargoon could prevent a [[lycanthrope]] from changing out of [[human]] form.
