Jargoon was a rare variety of zircon found in the Realms.The name jargoon was often incorrectly used to describe an assortment of gems, particularly by those of the pirate persuasion (as in "a cluster of jargoons, matey, with garnets as big as your hand").
Jargoons were valued for their resemblance to deep red rubies in color and luster. A typical specimen had a base value of 100&nbspgp.
One powerful use of this gemstone was as a magic missile enhancer. The caster held a jargoon in a hand and cast magic missile through it. This caused the jargoon to explode, but the number of missiles was doubled with no alteration in targets, damage, range, etc. The drawback was that the explosion damaged the casters hand as if struck by a single particularly strong magic missile.
An unproven legend stated that a jargoon could prevent a lycanthrope from changing out of human form.
