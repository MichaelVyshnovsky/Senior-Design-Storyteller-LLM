        "mainbody": "'''''Longbite''''', originally called the '''''Gentle Rain''''', was an [[enchanted]] [[greatsword]] forged by one of the apprenticed of a famous [[elf|elven]] smith [[Quilin]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Longbite'' was a deadly blade with a ''+2'' enchantment and a magically enhanced ''[[keen]]'' edge that could easily decapitate a [[giant]] and cause opponents flee in ''[[fear]]''.",
        "History": "The blade named the ''Gentle Rain'' was created to be a lesser cousin of an infamous enchanted greatsword - the ''[[Veiled Tears]]''. The weapon was forged by one of the apprentices of virtuoso smith Quilin for mistress [[Lissial]]. The sward was renamed to ''Longbite'' after it was wielded by Lissial against a [[hill giant]] ambush. The woman knew she was outmatched and charged at the giant leader. With one mighty swing, she decapitated the bandit while the rest of hill giants fled in terror.\n\nBy 1372 DR, ''Longbite'' ended up in the scaly hands of [[lizardfolk]] of the [[Lizard Marsh]]. The greatsword could be found in the hut of [[Saslick]], a leader of one of the lizard tribes of the Marsh."
