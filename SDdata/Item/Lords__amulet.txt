A '''''Lords' amulet''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] given to all [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. It was one of three pieces of clothing referred to as the [[Lord's ensemble]].

==Description==
The medallion portion of the amulet was made from [[gold]] and affixed to a [[silver]] chain. Each individual amulet was stamped with the symbol of the Lord who wore it.

==Powers==
A ''Lords' amulet'' had the properties of an ''[[amulet of proof against detection and location]]''. These amulets also acted as keys for special [[magical]] portals created by [[Khelben Arunsun]] and spread across [[Waterdeep]].
