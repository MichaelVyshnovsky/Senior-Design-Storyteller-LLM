A Lords amulet was an enchanted amulet given to all Lords of Waterdeep. It was one of three pieces of clothing referred to as the Lords ensemble.
The medallion portion of the amulet was made from gold and affixed to a silver chain. Each individual amulet was stamped with the symbol of the Lord who wore it.
A Lords amulet had the properties of an amulet of proof against detection and location. These amulets also acted as keys for special magical portals created by Khelben Arunsun and spread across Waterdeep.
