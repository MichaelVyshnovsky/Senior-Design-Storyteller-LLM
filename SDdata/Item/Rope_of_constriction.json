        "Description": "A ''rope of constriction'' resembled a ''[[rope of climbing]]'' or ''[[rope of entanglement]]''.",
        "Powers": "Once activated, a ''rope of constriction'' became a deadly weapon. It coiled around the neck of the wielder and up to four other individuals within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. The rope continued to strangle its victims until a ''[[dispel magic]]'' [[spell]] was cast on it. Those entwined in the rope were unable to cast spells or break free by any means."
