They claimed that an unsightly item was an ''amulet of protection'' and convinced unwitting nobles to purchase it for a hefty price. The same scam came in handy when the scion of [[House Wyvernspur]], [[Giogioni Wyvernspur|Giogioni]] faced the family's dark secret - an evil spellcaster [[Flattery Wyvernspur]].",
