Additionally, these wands' enchantments granted the wielder significant sagacity at the coast of lowered physique constitution. These wands could only be used by [[cleric]]s, [[paladin]]s, and [[ranger]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a ''wand of magus'' could be found locked away in an ancient study of the Silverspear Armory in Castle Cormanthor. Along with the wand, the chest contained the magic ''[[death's head ring]]'', several ''[[healing potion]]''s, and a '''[[potion of bull's strength]]''."
