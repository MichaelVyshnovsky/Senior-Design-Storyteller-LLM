Sashes of heat endurance were magical items that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
These items were red silk sashes, brocaded with gold thread depicting writhing flames. These sashes could not be worn over armor heavier than leather.
These sashes protected the wearer from normal fires that were smaller than a lamp flame. The wearer could also easily endure air temperatures of up to  comfortably. Wearers did not suffer from dehydration while wearing the sash.
These items were specially crafted by members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame. Lower-ranking members of the Brotherhood were awarded them as gifts.
