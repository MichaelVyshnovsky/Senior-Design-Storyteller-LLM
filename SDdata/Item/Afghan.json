While searching for any lore and history on the areas around the town, especially [[Keldar of the Forest]] and [[Keldar's Shrine]], adventurers visited an old cranky but knowledgeable crone. [[Kala (Dragon Falls)|Kala]] wore a warm knitted afghan during the meeting. She refused to take the throw off, whilst demanding the guests to fan her."
