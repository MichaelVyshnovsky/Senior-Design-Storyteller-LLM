While searching for any lore and history on the areas around the town, especially Keldar of the Forest and Keldars Shrine, adventurers visited an old cranky but knowledgeable crone. Kala wore a warm knitted afghan during the meeting. She refused to take the throw off, whilst demanding the guests to fan her."
