Winter wolf cloaks were enchanted cloaks that carried magical properties of winter wolves pelt they were made of.
These cloaks granted the wearers resistance to mundane and magical cold. Additionally, the cloaks slightly improved the wearers charisma.
Circa , Oswald Fiddlebender crafted various magic items of clothing using pelts of winter wolves that followed the Cultists of Auril that plagued Icewind Dale. Some of other items included winter wolf scarves, winter wolf gloves, winter wolf hats, and winter wolf boots.
