        "mainbody": "Lapis lazuli, incorrectly called lazurite in the South, was an ornamental stone found in the Realms.\nLapis lazuli was an opaque gem ranging in color from sky blue to dark blue, usually bespeckled with gold. These ornamental stones were typically cut cabochon and polished to enhance the look of the gold flecks. Lapis cabochons were often carved into more artistic shapes, such as griffons, scarabs, or unicorns. The deep blue specimens were the most in demand and commanded the highest prices. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.\nA lapis gemstone could be used as substitute for a ruby in the making of a periapt of health. Lapis lazuli was also crushed and used as an ingredient in making potions of heroism and super-heroism.\nHalfling pottery from Luiren created between 750 DR and 830 DR was known to be intricately decorated with malachite and lapis. This was somewhat unusual as hin preferred functionality to decoration."
