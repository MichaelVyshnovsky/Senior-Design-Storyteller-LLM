        "mainbody": "'''Lapis lazuli''', incorrectly called [[wikipedia:en:lazurite|lazurite]] in the [[South Faerûn|South]], was an [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] found in the Realms.",
        "Description": "Lapis lazuli was an opaque gem ranging in color from sky blue to dark blue, usually bespeckled with gold. These ornamental stones were typically cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] and polished to enhance the look of the gold flecks. Lapis cabochons were often carved into more artistic shapes, such as [[griffon]]s, [[scarab]]s, or [[unicorn]]s. The deep blue specimens were the most in demand and commanded the highest prices. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.",
        "Powers": "A lapis gemstone could be used as substitute for a [[ruby]] in the making of a ''[[periapt of health]]''. Lapis lazuli was also crushed and used as an ingredient in making ''[[Potion of heroism|potions of heroism]]'' and ''[[Potion of super-heroism|super-heroism]]''.",
        "Usages": "[[Halfling]] pottery from [[Luiren]] created between [[750 DR]] and [[830 DR]] was known to be intricately decorated with [[malachite]] and lapis. This was somewhat unusual as hin preferred functionality to decoration."
