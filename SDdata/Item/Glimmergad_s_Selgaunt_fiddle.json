According to the stories, Fiddlesticks used his fiddle to play such tear-jerking ballads, bank guards never realized that the gnome's associates were emptying the vaults.\n\nBy {{YearlinkName|1492}}, this unique but mundane instrument was sold at the [[Chromatic Scale]] musical instrument shop located on the second floor of [[The Glitter Gala]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was among several unique instruments in [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]]'s inventory."
