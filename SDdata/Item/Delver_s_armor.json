        "Powers": "These sets of [[plate mail]] were enhanced with a ''+2'' enchantment and improved the wearers defenses against most natural and magical dangers encountered in the dark subterranean places.",
        "History": "The [[dwarves]] of the delver's guild faced many dangers in their profession, including deadly attacks by [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and hungry evil beasties. The Order of Delvers built these sturdy sets of heavy armor to better protect the delvers from all things dangerous underground. In the late late 14{{th}} century DR, some sets of ''delver's armor'' were in the hands of other persons other than the guild members, found in the cities such as [[Neverwinter]], in the depths of [[Undermountain]], and along the trade routes of the [[Moonsea]] region."
