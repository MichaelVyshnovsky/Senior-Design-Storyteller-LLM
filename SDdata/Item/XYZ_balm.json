        "mainbody": "XYZ balm was an alchemical balm sold by hedge wizards.\nIt was a general purpose ointment used to cure burns, scrapes, and poisons such as poison ivy. It wasnt magical and couldnt heal those outright, instead speeding up the bodys recovery.\nDespite being nonmagical, it still required water that had passed down a unicorns horn for its synthesis. Hedge wizards often traded in it.\nIt was popular with thieves."
