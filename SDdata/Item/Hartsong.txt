'''''Hartsong''''' was the [[longbow]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] [[goddess]] [[Mielikki]], the Supreme Ranger.

==Abilities==
After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], Mielikki sometimes used a bow, but its arrows struck not to inflict injury but to bring life—where they landed, forest plants appeared and grew in a matter of moments, even [[entangle|entangling]] whoever she wished.

After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, ''Hartsong'' was a ''+5 [[speed]] [[composite longbow]]'' that put the full force of her strength behind its arrows.
