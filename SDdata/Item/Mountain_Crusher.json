        "mainbody": "'''''Mountain Crusher''''' was a magical composite [[longbow]] belonging to [[Tavis Burdun]], the First Defender of [[Hartsvale]].",
        "Description": "''Mountain Crusher'' was eight feet long. It was strung with woven steel cord. It was reinforced with the ribs of a glacier bear, allowing Tavis to use his incredible [[firbolg]] strength to best effect without risking snapping the weapon. The bow was covered in runes, which were etched by Tavis' [[runecaster]] companion, [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] of [[Lyndusfarne]].",
        "Powers": "The weapon was a ''+5 composite longbow'', which allowed Tavis to apply his full strength to his attacks. When Tavis said, \"Basil is great,\" backwards, one of the runes on the bow would glow a ruby color and then vanish, granting the bow its magical power. An arrow shot from the bow would leave a trail of crimson behind it as it flew.",
        "History": "''Mountain Crusher'' was specially crafted for Tavis, after his first bow, ''[[Bear Driller]]'', was broken in Tavis' battle with [[Arno and Julian]]. It received its name from Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] after Tavis used the weapon to create a landslide which trapped a group of [[fire giant]]s in the [[Gorge of the Silver Wyrm]].\n\nTavis wielded his bow frequently in combat, using runearrows from Basil as ammunition.",
