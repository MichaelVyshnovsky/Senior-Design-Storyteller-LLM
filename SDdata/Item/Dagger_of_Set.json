        "mainbody": "dagger of Set was an enchanted throwing dagger that was used by warriors who served Set.\nThe blade of this dagger was shaped like a snake.\nThe magic of these daggers made it more likely for them to strike and cause additional harm to targets. Additionally, they were more likely to strike vital organs, often resulting in an instant kill. The dagger would cling to the wound and continue to cause harm until removed by someone of great strength. While embedded in a target the dagger would search for vital organs until removed."
