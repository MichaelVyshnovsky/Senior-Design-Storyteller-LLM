        "mainbody": "Oberons Airy Lash was a unique magic ring, part of the Fading Rings set, that bore the name of the sylvan deity Oberon .\nThis ring was a delicately woven band of tanned leather strips.\nOberons Airy Lash was only usable by sorcerers and possessed an enchantment that increased the wearers initiative in exchange for reduced spell resistance. Additionally, this leather ring allowed its owner to cast the chain lightning spell.\nIn 1369 DR, Oberons Airy Lash was locked inside a magical and mysterious monument, the Great Stone Head. The statue was located in the Nightingale Court of the ruined Myth Drannor. In exchange for one of the eidolons, small totem-like statuettes depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings. One such ring was the elegant leather Fading Ring, Oberons Airy Lash."
