        "Description": "This ring was a delicately woven band of tanned leather strips.",
        "Powers": "''Oberon's Airy Lash'' was only usable by [[sorcerer]]s and possessed an enchantment that increased the wearer's initiative in exchange for reduced spell resistance. Additionally, this leather ring allowed its owner to cast the ''[[chain lightning]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Oberon's Airy Lash'' was locked inside a magical and mysterious monument, ''the Great Stone Head''. The statue was located in the [[Nightingale Court]] of the ruined [[Myth Drannor]]. In exchange for one of the ''[[eidolon]]s'', small totem-like statuettes depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic rings. One such ring was the elegant leather ''Fading Ring'', ''Oberon's Airy Lash''."
