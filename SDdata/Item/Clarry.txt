Clarry was a blended wine crafted primarily in Cormyr and the neighboring Sembia and Westgate. It was also sold through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Clarry was made by blending common table wines with honey and spices. Pink Clarry was used for special occasions.
Clarry could be purchased in the following containers
* Hand keg (4 sp)
* Cask (2 gp)
* Barrel (5 gp)
* Butt (14 gp)
* Tun (35 gp)
The War Wizard Lindavar preferred clarry. When he came to stay with his former mentor Benelaius in Ghars, Cormyr, in Eleint of 1367 DR, Benelaius sent Jasper out to buy a cask. Jasper purchased one from the Bold Bard, the only place in town to get it.
