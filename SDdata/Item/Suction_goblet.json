        "mainbody": "'''Suction goblets''' were a variety of drinking cups invented in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "In appearance, suction [[goblet]]s looked the same as their ordinary variety. Their base hid a cleverly designed suction cup that prevented the goblet from tipping even in the roughest seas. However, unlike more expensive functioning suction goblets, there existed many cheap ripoff versions made of [[wood]].",
        "History": "Suction goblets were still a very recent invention ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, but they quickly proved to be very popular among honest sailors and pirates of the [[Sea of Swords]]. As of the late 14{{th}} center DR, cheap wooden suction goblets could be found on the [[Nelanther Isles]] off the [[Sword Coast]] and even sold by Sister [[Tasina]] of the [[Temple of Umberlee (Spindrift Town)|Temple of Umberlee]] in [[Spindrift Town]]."
