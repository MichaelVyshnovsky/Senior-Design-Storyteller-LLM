        "mainbody": "Zarbrina was the name given in the Realms to cerussite, an extremely soft lead-like mineral, colorless and easily cut into brilliant faceted gems.\nDue to its softness, this ornamental stone was often used in ceremonial or little-used jewelry, or set in small protective metal claw mounts on sleeves or collar-hems of gowns.\nPowdered zarbrina could be used as an ingredient for magical ink when dealing with illusion magic."
