        "mainbody": "A '''kama''' ({{SingPl}}) was a type of light, short bladed weapon and farming implement that was most commonly used in or originated from the land of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "The kama was similar in design to a [[sickle]]&mdash;which is what the word meant in [[Wa-an]]&mdash;or a small [[scythe]], and bore a strong resemblance to a [[heavy pick]], but without the backside peen. However, unlike sickles these implements had far less curvature to their blade and started out broader at the base before tapering to a sharp tip. This blade was mounted on a straight shaft, about the same size as a [[handaxe]].",
        "Weaponology": "It took special training to use kama effectively in melee combat, therefore it was considered an exotic weapon. The relatively long, curved blade allowed the kama to be used for trip attacks.",
        "History": "Since the earliest days of warfare, kama were repurposed by Kara-Turan peasants for use in battle as they were forbidden from wielding [[sword]]s.\n\nAround the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, a wide variety of different enchanted kama could be found in use around [[Neverwinter]] and the wider [[Sword Coast North]].",
        "Notable Kamas": "* ''[[Balance in All Things]]'', a variety of kama with an [[enchantment]] based around fighting those who would seek to upset [[the Balance]].\n* ''Bluefire kama'', a variety of kama that came from or were associated with the [[Order of the Blue Fire]].<ref>\n* ''[[Eye of the Sun|Eyes of the Sun]]'', a variety of enchanted kama that were created by members of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]].\n* ''[[Empty Fields]]'', a variety of enchanted kama that originated from the nation of [[Calimshan]].\n* ''[[Hideo's kama]]'', a variety of enchanted kama from the [[Kyo Prefecture]] that was named for its creator.\n* ''[[Honor's Edge]]'', a variety of enchanted kama that were created to fight creatures of [[law]].\n* ''[[Imaskari kama]]'', a variety of enchanted kama that were created in the ancient [[Imaskar Empire]].\n* ''[[Peasant Blade]]''\n* ''[[Peasant Dynasty]]'', a common variety of enchanted kama.\n* ''[[Rod of surprises]]'', an enchanted ''+1 [[rod]]'' that could transform in a variety of weapons, including a kama.\n* ''[[Ropecutter]]'', a rather common variety of enchanted kama.\n* ''[[Thread of Life]]'', a variety of enchanted kama that originated in Kara-Tur, created by the [[healer]] devotees of [[Aido Glade]].",
        "Notable Users": {
            "Classes": "* Kama were a common weapon among [[monk]]s, who could take full advantage of their quick slashing action when not weighed down by armor.\n* Kama were a common weapon among [[ninja]]s, as their role as farming implements made it easier for them to be carried around without arousing undue suspicion.\n* Some [[shukenja]] were known to wield kama.",
            "Groups": "* The [[Stone Knives tribe|Stone Knives]], a [[Batiri]] tribe in the jungles of [[Samarach]], commonly wielded kama."
