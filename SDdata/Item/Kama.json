        "mainbody": "A kama () was a type of light, short bladed weapon and farming implement that was most commonly used in or originated from the land of Kara-Tur.\nThe kama was similar in design to a sickle&mdashwhich is what the word meant in Wa-an&mdashor a small scythe, and bore a strong resemblance to a heavy pick, but without the backside peen. However, unlike sickles these implements had far less curvature to their blade and started out broader at the base before tapering to a sharp tip. This blade was mounted on a straight shaft, about the same size as a handaxe.\nIt took special training to use kama effectively in melee combat, therefore it was considered an exotic weapon. The relatively long, curved blade allowed the kama to be used for trip attacks.\nSince the earliest days of warfare, kama were repurposed by Kara-Turan peasants for use in battle as they were forbidden from wielding swords.\nAround the mid-to-late 14 century DR, a wide variety of different enchanted kama could be found in use around Neverwinter and the wider Sword Coast North.\n* Balance in All Things, a variety of kama with an enchantment based around fighting those who would seek to upset the Balance.\n* Bluefire kama, a variety of kama that came from or were associated with the Order of the Blue Fire.\n* Eyes of the Sun, a variety of enchanted kama that were created by members of the Order of the Sun Soul.\n* Empty Fields, a variety of enchanted kama that originated from the nation of Calimshan.\n* Hideos kama, a variety of enchanted kama from the Kyo Prefecture that was named for its creator.\n* Honors Edge, a variety of enchanted kama that were created to fight creatures of law.\n* Imaskari kama, a variety of enchanted kama that were created in the ancient Imaskar Empire.\n* Peasant Blade\n* Peasant Dynasty, a common variety of enchanted kama.\n* Rod of surprises, an enchanted +1 rod that could transform in a variety of weapons, including a kama.\n* Ropecutter, a rather common variety of enchanted kama.\n* Thread of Life, a variety of enchanted kama that originated in Kara-Tur, created by the healer devotees of Aido Glade.\n* Many sailors and pirates in the Nelanther Isles were known to wield ropecutter kama in the 14 century DR.\n* Kama were a common weapon among monks, who could take full advantage of their quick slashing action when not weighed down by armor.\n* Kama were a common weapon among ninjas, as their role as farming implements made it easier for them to be carried around without arousing undue suspicion.\n* Some shukenja were known to wield kama.\n* The Stone Knives, a Batiri tribe in the jungles of Samarach, commonly wielded kama."
