An amulet of proof against detection and location was a magical amulet that protected its wearer against divination magic such as scrying.
The amulet protected its wearer in a way similar to the nondetection spell. An attuned wearer was immune from being targeted by divination spells, although sufficiently powerful diviners could attempt to overcome its protection. Moreover, the wearer could not be perceived by sensors such as the ones created by the scrying spell.
