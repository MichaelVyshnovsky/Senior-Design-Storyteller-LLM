An '''''amulet of proof against detection and location''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[amulet]] that protected its wearer against [[divination]] [[magic]] such as [[scrying]].

==Powers==
The amulet protected its wearer in a way similar to the ''[[nondetection]]'' [[spell]]. An attuned wearer was immune from being targeted by divination spells, although sufficiently powerful diviners could attempt to overcome its protection.
