        "mainbody": "awkstones Bulwark was a magical shield made of a solid, 2-inch-thick slab of blue-tinted steel. It earned its name while in the possession of Hawkstone, a ranger from the Dragon Reach.\nThe shield possessed a +2 enchantment and quite a unique power. Upon utterance of its command word \"bulwark\", the shield would briefly disappear, and reappear as a 60-long, 2-wide bridge of reinforced steel. Speaking the word \"krawlub\" would cause the shield to revert back to its normal form.\nThe first known appearance of the Bulwark was within the hoard of the black dragon Yindoth, discovered after the wyrm was slain by Hawkstone. He wielded it during his crusade against the giants of the Great Glacier and ogres of Thar. Interred with Hawkstone after his death, the shield was taken by graverobbers along with his sword Durelva."
