        "mainbody": "'''''Hawkstone's Bulwark''''' was a magical [[shield]] made of a solid, 2-inch-thick slab of blue-tinted [[steel]]. It earned its name while in the possession of [[Hawkstone]], a [[ranger]] from the [[Dragon Reach]].",
        "Powers": "The shield possessed a +2 enchantment and quite a unique power. Upon utterance of its [[command word]] \"''bulwark''\", the shield would briefly disappear, and reappear as a 60'-long, 2'-wide bridge of reinforced steel. Speaking the word \"''krawlub''\" would cause the shield to revert back to its normal form.",
        "History": "The first known appearance of the ''Bulwark'' was within the hoard of the [[black dragon]] [[Yindoth]], discovered after the wyrm was slain by Hawkstone. He wielded it during his crusade against the [[giant]]s of the [[Great Glacier]] and [[ogre]]s of [[Thar]]. Interred with Hawkstone after his death, the shield was taken by graverobbers along with his [[sword]] ''[[Durelva]]''."
