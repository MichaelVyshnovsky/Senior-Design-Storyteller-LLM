'''''Eternal carafe of wine (or sometimes acid)''''' an [[enchanted]] [[carafe]] of dubious magics, a less useful version of a ''[[decanter of endless water]]''.

==Powers==
This strange enchanted item was seemingly an ordinary carafe that refilled every morning with [[wine]] and, on occasion, with [[acid]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an ''eternal carafe of wine (or sometimes acid)'' was displayed among splendorous enchanted rewards for those willing to partake in [[Akabi]]'s Wheel of Fortune game in the [[Circus of the Last Days]] during its stay in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]].
