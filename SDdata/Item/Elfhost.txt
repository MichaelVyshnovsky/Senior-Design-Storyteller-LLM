Elfhost was a sentient longsword of the House Floshin sun elves.
Forged especially to defeat elves foes, the swords pommel featured a large ruby and its blade was mithral.
A +5 longsword, Elfhosts strikes were especially damaging to goblinoids. The sword could teleport without error, locate objects, and heal those it touched in addition to magically defending its bearer. It also could detect nearby secret doors and gems.
The sword was given its name by its orc and goblin foes.
Elfhost belonged to Elorfindar Floshin in the late 14 century DR and had been passed down in the family for generations.
