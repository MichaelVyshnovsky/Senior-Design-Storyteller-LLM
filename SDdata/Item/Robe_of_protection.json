As mages fought unarmored, these robes were more likely to be worn by them, instead of others that were proficient at wearing armor. However, the robes could still be worn by those of other professions, such as clerics, providing their enchantment was strong enough.\n* Kirath, powerful mage and owner of a robe of protection +5.\n* Cordwainer, Minster of Enchantment in Ravens Bluff, and owner of a robe of protection +5.\n* Anastra Sylun√© Silverhand, whose brown robe was a robe of protection +4.\n* Tamoko, owner of a black silk night-suit that functioned as a robe or protection +3.\n* Illius, sorcerer and owner of a robe of protection.\n* Khenel Barony, owner of a robe of protection.\nIn the 1350s DR, a very strongly enchanted robe of protection could be found in Xanathars outer sanctum.
