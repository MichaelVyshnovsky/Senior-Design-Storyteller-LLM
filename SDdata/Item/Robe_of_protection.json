        "mainbody": "A '''robe of protection''' was a [[robe]] that was enchanted to protect the wearer.",
        "Description": "The [[magic]]al robes provided different levels of protection, depending on how highly enchanted they were. As [[mage]]s fought unarmored, these robes were more likely to be worn by them, instead of others that were proficient at wearing [[armor]]. However, the robes could still be worn by those of other professions, such as [[cleric]]s, providing their enchantment was strong enough.",
