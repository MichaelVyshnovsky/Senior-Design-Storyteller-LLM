        "mainbody": "The '''''black kumade''''' was a magical [[javelin]] wielded by [[Lin Goh]], clanmaster of the [[Panthers of Xi]] in [[Koryo]] around [[1357 DR]]. It became a symbol of that [[ninja]] clan.<ref group=\"note\">Although named as a [[kumade]], a kind of weaponized rake, the ''black kumade'' is only statted and described as a javelin. It is unclear if or how this weapon functions as a kumade. It may be that it has a barbed head.<ref group=\"note\">It is unknown what relation this weapon has to the [[black kumade (spear)|''black kumade'']] appearing in the ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' games.\n\nIt was an [[obsidian]] ''+2 javelin'' that would return to its wielder when hurled. It could also be spun like a baton to deflect attacks; while spinning, it served as a ''+3 [[shield]]''."
