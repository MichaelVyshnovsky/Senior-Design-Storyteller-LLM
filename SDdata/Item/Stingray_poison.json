        "mainbody": "Stingray poison was a type of venom produced by and extracted from a species of fish called sting rays. \nDespite not necessarily being deadly, stingray venom was still potent and dangerous. Those affected by the poison were recommended to immediately seek a healers aid. Additionally, the poison affected the targets constitution and caused bad nausea.  Individuals of good health and resilience were expected to fully recover from the potions effects within 24-48 hours.\nIf by some unlucky occurrence, a creature consumed stingray poison, the substance had a high chance of affecting the imbiber.\nVials of stingray poison were in common use around the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the deadly substance for sale."
