        "mainbody": "The Assad Head was a sculpture found in the Assad Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThis  tall figure was made of sandstone and resembled a lions head. Its eyes were closed and the mouth was open.\nMany locals believed the Assad Head would speak if certain events took place. Some even claimed that the head was facing a different direction than when they saw it from the previous night.\nSome believed that the statue was once an idol worshiped by isolated desert tribes. The statue was believed to have mysteriously followed the tribesmen into civilization once they became Enlightened. Once exposed to the Law of the Loregiver, the statue was said to have become Enlightened itself."
