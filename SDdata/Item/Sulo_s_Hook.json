        "mainbody": "Sulos Hook was an enchanted parrying dagger that gained notoriety whilst in possession of Captain \"Baron\" Sulo of Luskan, sometime before the early 14 century DR.\nSulos Hook had a peculiar design, created to be specifically used for parrying by duelists.\nThe blade was relatively harmless as a weapon, making it hard to wield it offensively. However, the items wide handguard and enchantments made it invaluable for defense, guiding the welders hand towards the enemys blows, deflecting them harmlessly.\nThe daggers origin was unknown, but its first recorded wielder was an infamous corsair Sulo. He first encountered the magic weapon while performing a sea heist off the coast of Port Llast, acquiring the jewels of the Leberm family of the Sword Coast North. Sulo faced a band of experienced adventurers who were guarding the precious cargo. One of the adventurers was wielding two identical parrying daggers. The duelist slew several corsairs and severed Sulos left hand. With Lady Lucks or her grim sisters blessing, the adventurer was killed by a stray ballista shot, saving \"Baron\" Sulos life. The duelist was dragged into the water, leaving behind only one of his daggers. That blade became known as Sulos Hook after the corsair fashioned a prosthetic out of it.\nSulos Hook remained attached to the corsairs stump for the next nine years until his death. The weapon was interred with its owner in a hidden tomb along with a significant treasure that the pirate accumulated through his career. The burial sight, however, was not as secret as once thought, and soon after, it was robbed, and Sulos Hook changed owners since then.\nIn the , Sulos Hook was found on a body of a man who perished within the Fell Wood, east of the village of Kuldahar, high on the Spine of the World. The daggers owner was likely lured into the forest by its population of hungry will-o-wisp, where he perished by a stone circle."
