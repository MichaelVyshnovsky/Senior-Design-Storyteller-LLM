A '''''cloak of poisonousness''''' was a [[magic]] [[cloak]] that would kill whoever wore it.

==Description==
This cloak was typically made of a woolly material, though ones made with leather were known to exist.

==Powers==
Upon wearing this cloak, a creature would usually be immediately killed, though those of high fortitude were able to resist its effect and merely handling it would pose no danger. The [[poison]] within the cloak could be detected through use of a ''[[detect poison]]'' [[spell]], after which a small label would be visible that bore the words, ''"Nesus Shirt company"''.

This poison made it impossible to bring the victim back to life with a ''[[raise dead]]'' or ''[[resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' spell until a ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell was used.

Removing this cloak from a victim required use of a ''[[remove curse]]'' spell, which would destroy its magical properties.

==Trivia==
Depending upon how skilled they were, an [[alchemist]] could identify a ''cloak of poisonousness'' and then negate its poison effect.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|35}}
