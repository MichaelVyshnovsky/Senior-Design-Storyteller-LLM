A greataxe was a double-bladed, two-handed melee weapon in the axe family.
The greataxe was a large, heavy battleaxe with a double-bladed head. The shaft was usually constructed of stout wood and longer than even a dwarven waraxe, with about half that length being just the grip alone.
Wielded two-handed, the double blades allowed an alternating forward/backswing attack with devastating results. Because they required some training to use effectively, greataxes were typically considered a martial weapon.
* Barbarians tended to favor the greataxe for their tremendous lethality.
