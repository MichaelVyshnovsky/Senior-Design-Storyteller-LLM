A '''greataxe''' was a double-bladed, two-handed melee weapon in the [[axe]] family.

==Description==
The greataxe was a large, heavy [[battleaxe]] with a double-bladed head. The shaft was usually constructed of stout wood and longer than even a [[dwarven waraxe]], with about half that length being just the grip alone.

==Weaponology==
Wielded two-handed, the double blades allowed an alternating forward/backswing attack with devastating results. Because they required some training to use effectively, greataxes were typically considered a martial weapon.
