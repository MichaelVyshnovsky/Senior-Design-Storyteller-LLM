A storm-sword or stormsword was a magical sword typical in Myth Drannor.
When drawn, purple lightning danced around the blade of these longswords, and around their hilts too.
Storm-swords bore a powerful offensive enchantment, and could sunder almost any magical barrier on a strike even a prismatic wall and related spells were pierced, one color at a time, per strike.
Every nine days, the weapon could be called upon to unleash a lightning bolt every minute for up to one hour, which swept a  area and stretched forward for . After the first lightning bolt was launched, the weapon could instead be used to teleport the wielder and up to one other creature they were touching, as per dimension door, instead of lightning bolts, but that consumed the bolt for that minute. If there was a storm overhead, the bolts potency was doubled.
Storm-swords were mass-produced in Cormanthor, yet they were borne only by heads of the Houses, war captains, and heirs. They were extremely expensive to create.
In the , three lords of Cormanthor—Lord Haladavar, Lord Urddusk, and Lord Malgath—drew their storm-swords to protest the Opening of Cormanthor during a meeting with Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl.
