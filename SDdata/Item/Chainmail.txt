'''Chainmail''' (also known as '''chain mail''' or simply '''chain''') was a type of armor used on Toril.

==Description==
Chainmail was a common form of armor made of interlocking metal rings.

Chainmail could comprise an entire set of armor, or it could be a specific article, such as a chain shirt or [[gauntlet]]. [[Boom's Garden]] sold chainmail chemises (45 [[gp]]), [[corset]]s (25 gp), leggings (35 gp), [[loincloth]]s (20 gp), bustenhalts/brassieres (15 gp), and skirts (40 gp). Chainmail was also often used for [[barding]]. 

Chain shirts covered only the torso, leaving the arms and legs free. Full chainmail armor covered most of the body and hung from the shoulders, making it uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Armor usually came with a padded hood known as a [[mail coif]], either as a separate garment or built-into the armor.

Lace mail was a variant of chainmail that was "airier" and showed off the skin beneath it.

Ring mail was a variant of chainmail in which large metal rings were sewn onto a backing of leather or cloth. It was harder to maintain and provided less protection than standard chainmail.

==Materials==
Chainmail was usually made from metal. In [[Faerûn]], the following special metals were typically used:
*[[Adamantine]]
*[[Arandur]]
*Magically-treated [[copper]]
*[[Darksteel]]
*[[Dlarun]]
*[[Fever iron]]
*[[Hizagkuur]]
*[[Living metal]]
*[[Mithral]]
*Treated [[platinum]]

Sometimes, other nonmetal materials could be used to make special chainmail:
*[[Silverweave]] (silver coral fronds), used by the races of [[Serôs]].
*[[Bluewood]], used by [[volodni]] in the [[Unapproachable East]].
