        "History": "The name of the master who crafted these longbows was long forgotten. Many ''Rippers'' were lost, stolen, and destroyed. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], only a handful of ''Rippers'' were known to exist and a few could be found on the [[Sword Coast]], in the city of [[Neverwinter]], and in [[Elventree]] in the [[Moonsea]] region."
