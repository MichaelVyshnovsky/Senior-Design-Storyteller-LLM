        "mainbody": "Rippers were ancient enchanted longbows that were once wielded by half-elven scouts in Anauroch.\nThese bows possessed +3 enchantments and had the capability of delivering devastatingly mighty shots. Additionally, Rippers made their wielders immune to any mind-affecting abilities and spells.\nThe name of the master who crafted these longbows was long forgotten. Many Rippers were lost, stolen, and destroyed. By the late 14 century DR, only a handful of Rippers were known to exist and a few could be found on the Sword Coast, in the city of Neverwinter, and in Elventree in the Moonsea region."
