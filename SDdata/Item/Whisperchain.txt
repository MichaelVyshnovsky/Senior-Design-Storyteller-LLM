'''''Whisperchain''''' was a unique suit of [[chain armor]] found in [[Lost Souls' Swamp]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The silvery armor covered most of the body and was made of [[mithral]]. While mithral would normally be light, ''Whisperchain'' was actually completely weightless.

==Powers==
The suit of armor was weightless and partially [[ethereal plane|ethereal]], and imparted it on the wearer. It let them strike effectively at incorporeal targets that otherwise slid out of material reality. It also made the wearer [[blur]]ry and harder to hit in turn, and boosted their awareness and reflexes in both dodging and striking.

==History==
The armor was stored in a secret loot stash in [[Lost Souls' Swamp]] by [[Evrim Whitehair]]. When they were killed by their friends, a [[shadow]] monster in the swamp trapped Evrim as a spectral [[undead]], and the armor (and the rest of the treasures) remained in the same pool Evrim's body was dumped in. It may have been recovered a few years later by [[adventurer]]s pursuing a piece of the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'' held by the [[medusa]] [[Sshaastess]], who had laired nearby.
