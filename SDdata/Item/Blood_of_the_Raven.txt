Blood of the Raven was a black wine consumed by the members of the Cult of the Raven, a secretive organization that was already quite old in 1370 DR.
Blood of the Raven was black in color and salty to taste. This wine was consumed communally among the worshipers of the spirit only referred to as the Raven. The wine had the ability to pass dream-like visions of the Ravens will to its worshipers, although that happened very rarely and only to the favored individuals.
