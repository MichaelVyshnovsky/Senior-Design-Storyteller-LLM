'''Feedbags''', also known as '''nosebags''', were a type of [[pouch]] used to feed domesticated animals, typically [[horse]]s.

==Description==
These pouches were typically made of either cloth or leather and designed to fit over an animal's mouth. They had large straps sewn onto their hem that were long enough to fit over an animal's head, allowing pouches to fit snugly in place while eaten from.
