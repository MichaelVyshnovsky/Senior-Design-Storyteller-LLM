Feedbags, also known as nosebags, were a type of pouch used to feed domesticated animals, typically horses.
These pouches were typically made of either cloth or leather and designed to fit over an animals mouth. They had large straps sewn onto their hem that were long enough to fit over an animals head, allowing pouches to fit snugly in place while eaten from.
