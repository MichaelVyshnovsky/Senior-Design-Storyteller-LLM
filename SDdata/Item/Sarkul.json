        "Description": "Sarkul was made using the [[fish]] from the [[Dragon Reach]]. The catch was beheaded, cleaned, gutted, and drenched in [[honey]] and local seasonings, before being hanged and smoked. The process of smoking took several days. The fish was cooked in enclosed smokehouses. The result was a savory food. Sarkul was never used as a filling for Tantran [[baeranth]] pies."
