Due to its small size, a buckler was of limited use in defending against missiles.\nBucklers could be made from various objects. Fighting clerics could strap a field brazier to their arm to serve as a buckler. The eladrin wizard Caelynna used a clamshell as a buckler. Ironwood saw usage throughout much of the Sword Coast, as the material made for very durable and lighter weight bucklers. And in Zakhara, many daraqs (Zakharan bucklers) were made from tortoise shells.\n*Danifae Yauntyrr wielded a morningstar and buckler.\n*Caelynna used a clamshell as a buckler.\n*Marckarius Millithor.\n* The Cultists of the Shattered Peak typically used bucklers. \n* Priests of Arvoreen were known to wear buckler amulets."
