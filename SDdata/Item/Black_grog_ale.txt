'''Black grog ale''' was a cheap watered down [[ale]] favored by the pirates and criminal elements of [[Waterdeep]] and [[Immurk's Hold]] of the [[Pirate Isles]].

==History==
Black grog ale was brought to Waterdeep by the immigrants from the Pirate Isles of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The pirates who found a new home in Waterdeep served as the core consumers of the grog and eventually the local taverns and inns started importing numerous [[barrel]]s of the grog from Immurk's Hold.

By [[1372 DR]], black grog ale was being moved from [[Waterdeep]] to other cities along the [[Sword Coast]] and down the [[Trade Way]], such as [[Daggerford]], (available from [[Happy Cow]] and [[Black Stone Inn]]), as well as [[Liam's Hold]].
