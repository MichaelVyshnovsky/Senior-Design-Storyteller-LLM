Black grog ale was a cheap watered down ale favored by the pirates and criminal elements of Waterdeep and Immurks Hold of the Pirate Isles.
Black grog ale was brought to Waterdeep by the immigrants from the Pirate Isles of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The pirates who found a new home in Waterdeep served as the core consumers of the grog and eventually the local taverns and inns started importing numerous barrels of the grog from Immurks Hold.
By 1372 DR, black grog ale was being moved from Waterdeep to other cities along the Sword Coast and down the Trade Way, such as Daggerford, (available from Happy Cow and Black Stone Inn), as well as Liams Hold.
