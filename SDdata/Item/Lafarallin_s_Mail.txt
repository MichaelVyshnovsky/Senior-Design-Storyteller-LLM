Lafarallins Mail was an enchanted suit of elven chainmail once worn by the great elven hero Lafarallin.
The armor felt weightless when worn and, in addition to providing magical protection from physical attacks, the armor made it easier to resist spell effects.
The suit of chainmail was preserved at Queen Amlaruil Moonflowers palace on Evermeet.
