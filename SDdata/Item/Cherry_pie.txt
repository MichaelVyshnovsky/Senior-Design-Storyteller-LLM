'''Cherry pies''' were sweet baked dishes of [[cherries]] cooked in [[sugar]] and wrapped in pastry dough.

==Description==
Cherry pies were cooked in soft buttery flaky pastry with a stuffing of delectable and succulent red and black cherries poached in [[elderflower wine]] and sugar.

==Availability==
These cherry pies were a staple of [[Nell's Pie Shop]] of [[Liam's Hold]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

[[Turmish]] folk created [[Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie]]s that were especially tart versions of these sweet treats.
