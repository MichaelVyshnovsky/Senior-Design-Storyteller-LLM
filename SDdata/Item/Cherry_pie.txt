Cherry pies were sweet baked dishes of cherries cooked in sugar and wrapped in pastry dough.
Cherry pies were cooked in soft buttery flaky pastry with a stuffing of delectable and succulent red and black cherries poached in elderflower wine and sugar.
These cherry pies were a staple of Nells Pie Shop of Liams Hold circa 1372 DR.
Turmish folk created Turmishite apple and bloodberry pies that were especially tart versions of these sweet treats.
