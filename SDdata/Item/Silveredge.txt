Silveredge was a sword of sharpness created by the Obarskyr dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the Four from Cormyr along with the Seal of Iron, Deathsend, and Fireblood.
Silveredge was an elaborately-finished bastard sword. The blade and handle was adorned with carved depictions of kings fighting giants and dragons, and the blade was trimmed in silver. It had a special recess in the pommel for Fireblood to be placed in.
Silveredges scabbard had a special compartment for storing the dagger Deathsend, and a circular indentation which was intended to hold the Seal of Iron.
Silveredge had all the properties of a sword of sharpness, allowing it to easily destroy objects and dismember creatures. The entire sword gave a sky-blue glow that illuminated the area.
Silveredge was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. By 1369 DR, Silveredge was kept by Torm inside the Tower of Ruin, where it was won by adventurers who proved their bravery and loyalty. They then went on to reassemble it with the other Four from Cormyr.
