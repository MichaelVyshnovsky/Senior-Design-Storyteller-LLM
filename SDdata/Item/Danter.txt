The '''danter''' (sometimes spelled '''dantar''', or lovingly â€“ "little pearl") was a [[gold]] coin minted in [[Amn]] and used as standard currency there. Its value was equivalent to one gold piece.

==Description==
Gold danters were pressed with the image of a circle of six tiny stars on one side. Gold coins were the default currency in Amn, and all prices were generally listed in Danters.

==Value==
A single gold danter was worth 200 [[fandar]]s, 20 [[taran]]s, or 2 [[centaur (currency)|centaur]]s, while 1 [[roldon]] was worth 5 danters. The two most common [[trade bar]] denominations pressed in Amn were for 500 or 1000 danters. However, there were trade bards worth as much as 3.5 million danters.

When dealing in currencies from other nations, [[Zazesspur]]'s [[gulder]] was less valued than Amnian danter. 100 danter could buy you 107 gulders in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. When dealing in [[Ithmong]]'s currency, 113 [[molean]]s bought 100 danters. 138 [[Myratma]]'s [[myrat]]s were worth 100 danters, and 175 Saradush's [[zoth]]s were worth 100 danters.

==Laws==
Counterfeiting Amnian coins was illegal in [[Tethyr]] to no surprise, punishable by a strict prison sentence and public shaming after the confiscation of assets of deemed equal value to the damages done to the country. The oldest counterfeiting practice in Tethyr consisted of melting [[copper]] coins down and pressing them into danter shapes. A gilding layer finished the illusion of an authentic danter.
