        "mainbody": "onnets were a type of hat common in agricultural communities.\nBonnets had wide brims and were rather flimsy, but were thick enough to shelter their wearers face and neck from the sun.\n* Shelaerra Blundfeather, the head of the household servants in Raventree Villa, sometimes styled her long hair into a bun and wore it under a bonnet.\n* In the Blade Kingdoms, fanciful bonnets were common among noble women.\n* Around the mid-14 century DR, one of the many common pieces of headwear for Waterdhavian women included pleated linen bonnets, often embroidered and featuring tassels."
