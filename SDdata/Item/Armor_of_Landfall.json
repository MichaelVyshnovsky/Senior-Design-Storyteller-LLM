        "mainbody": "The '''''Armor of Landfall''''' was a set of [[druid]]ic [[light armor]] that granted the wearer the ability to grow plant life magically, found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ''Armor of Landfall'' had a distinct non-unpleasant aroma of a wild garden of [[rose]]s, [[moss]], and [[hibiscus]].",
        "Powers": "This light armor possessed the power to boost the wearer's spellcasting abilities, guiding their [[spell]]s towards the targets. It also granted them an upper hand in resisting constitution-draining spells and effects. Lastly, the wearer could invoke druidic magic to cast the ''[[plant growth]]'' spell once per day, and whilst the wearer of the ''Armor of Landfall'' stood amidst the magically created plants, they received small amounts of magical healing.",
        "History": "The ''Armor of Landfall'' was once worn by a powerful but reclusive druid sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when the druidic garb found its way into the stock of the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] in Baldur's Gate."
