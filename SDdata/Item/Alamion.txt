'''''Alamion''''', also known as "'''''Frost Daddy'''''" or "'''''Frost Father'''''", was a magical [[longsword]] specialized against [[evil]] [[outsider]]s.

==Powers==
In addition to being more damaging to evil outsiders, Alamion also conferred the effects of an ''[[endure elements]]'' spell upon the wielder, granting limited resistance to fire. It also detected whenever fire-wielding creatures came within {{SI|100|yard|long=yes}} of the blade, changing in appearance to glowing, translucent ice. When in this form, the wielder left frost-covered footprints.

==History==
Around [[1081 DR]], the wizard [[Obren the Left-Handed]] of [[Shannath]] made a pair of swords, the longsword ''Alamion'' and the [[short sword]] ''[[Malamion]]'', on commission from priests of [[Auril]]. However, as a result of a conflict between the mage and the clergy over payment, the swords never came into the possession of Auril's faithful.

Thirty years later, around [[1111 DR]], the warrior [[Berdino]] was overheard by the thief [[Pellas the Fair]] in [[Procampur]], boasting about owning a sword that matched the description of ''Alamion''. Pellas, having come into the possession of Malamion around [[1097 DR]], learned of the short sword's counterpart, and desired to have both blades. Berdino's body was found two [[tenday]]s later, left for dead on a beach, riddled with poisoned [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s.

Some time later, Pellas met his end at the hands of the next owner of the two blades, the [[Torm]]ish [[paladin]] [[Garilon Renold]]. Garilon made heavy use of the blades in battling outsiders, and the weapons passed on to paladins belonging to his order for generations. The last member of the order known to have used the swords was [[Heleban]] of [[Ithmong]], who, it is believed, met his end in battle against pirates and slavers of the [[Sword Coast]].

By [[1281 DR]], Alamion was in the possession of [[Ilmadia Bariel]].
