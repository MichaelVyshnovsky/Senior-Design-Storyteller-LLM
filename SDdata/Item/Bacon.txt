'''Bacon''' was a fatty cut of [[pork]], generally from the side of a [[pig]] or [[boar]], eaten largely across northern and western [[Faerûn]].{{Cite dragon/277/The New Adventures of Volo: Dragonwing Stew|93}} Along the [[Sword Coast North]], pieces of bacon were sometimes simply referred to as slices of '''boar fat'''. 
{{Quote|''How the trembling [[Nine Hells|Hells]] do we go through so much bacon?''|[[Mardin Eftnacos]], owner of [[Mardin's Hearth-House]] in [[Waterdeep]]}}

==Description==
Bacon was used in all manner of dishes, but it was particularly common to eat it for morning meals as part of a [[dawnfry]] or [[morningfeast]]. In the [[Western Heartlands]], it was commonly served alongside toasted [[bread]] flavored with the bacon drippings, or in thick slabs garnished with [[fruit]] (such as [[quince]]) and [[scrambled eggs]], occasionally paired with [[coffee]]. In the [[Dalelands]], it might be accompanied by some or all of fresh [[milk]], [[dove]]'s [[egg]]s, [[grape]]s, [[radish]]es, savory [[tart]]s, fried [[mushroom]]s, [[cheese]], fried bread, [[tomato]]es and [[wine]].{{Cite digital book/Spellfire||12}} In the [[Lands of Intrigue]], it might be served alongside [[pancakes]] and [[honey]]-[[molasses]] syrup, with eggs, or in [[omelet]]s along with additions like [[sausage]], cheese, [[onion]]s, and [[pepper]]s. In the [[Moonsea]], it was eaten alongside eggs and [[honeycake]]s. In [[Ravens Bluff]], it was eaten with eggs and occasionally with [[Zakhara]]n coffee. In the [[Border Kingdoms]], it was eaten alongside eggs, [[ham]], toast, and fruit like [[apple]]s and [[melon]]s. The [[Ffolk]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] ate bacon with [[goose]] eggs and fresh [[cream]] paired with either [[cake]] or bread,{{Cite digital book/Darkwell||7}}{{Cite digital book/Darkwell||16}} and the [[dwarves]] of the Moonshaes kept it as travel food. On the [[Sea of Swords]], ships might stock bacon alongside breakfast [[steak]], fried [[potato]]es, [[wheat cake]]s, and [[orange]]s for morning meals. In the [[North]], bacon was often served along with fried bread, accompanied with things like a wedge of cheese, dark [[beer]], and a raw onion, or with eggs and fried [[fish]]. The dwarves of the North ate bacon with eggs, [[muffin]]s, and [[berries]].

Aside from being a morning food, bacon was an important ingredient in many other dishes and meals across dwarven, [[human]], and even [[orc]]ish cuisine. Examples included [[High Dale lamb]] (a traditional dish from [[Highcastle]]), dwarven [[Potato leek soup]], [[bloodlick]] in [[the Vast]] (a gravy-like spread eaten on bread by farmers),{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|21}} and [["orc" bacon]] (spiced or sweetened baked bacon strips). Bacon dishes were also popular as [[tavern]] food and in [[pie]]s and [[hand pie]]s, often paired with [[leek]], [[kidney]], or [[gooseberries]].

Bacon generally stored and travelled well, especially when wrapped in [[wax]] paper,{{Cite dungeon/19/The Serpent's Tooth|29}} which perhaps contributed to it being a reliable [[ration]] among manual laborers, sailors, soldiers,

===Other Uses===
Bacon fat was used to cook vegetables like mushrooms and onions{{Cite digital book/Spellfire||11}} and was an important ingredient in pastry dough throughout the [[Eastern Heartlands]]. The [[Watchful Eye (Essembra)|Watchful Eye]] in [[Essembra]] used bacon fat in the pastry of their [[Stuffed Turkey Pie]], and the [[Wight on a Waterdragon]] restaurant in [[Marsember]] used it to make the pastry shell of their "sea pie" (filled with various macerated sea creatures cooked in [[beef]] stew). Bacon fat was measured by the [[Knife (unit of measurement)|knife]].

In a pinch, flaming bacon could be used as a weapon.{{Cite dragon/145/Your Home Is Your Castle|34}}

==Availability==
While bacon was produced throughout north and west Faerûn, some locations' product had distinct reputations, such as the town of [[Hlintar]] in the Vast, which was was famous for its high-quality bacon, or [[High Helm]] in [[Cormyr]], known for their bacon being very salty. Outside of north and west Faerûn, bacon was eaten in the Border Kingdoms{{Cite digital book/Stardeep||6}} Bacon was not commonly eaten by elves to the extent that [[half-elves]] would sometimes add bacon to elven dishes as an act of rebellion.
