        "mainbody": "lfgates were enchanted portals that connected Evermeet with Faerûn.\nMost elfgates only offered one-way transportation from Evermeet to Faerûn, but a few could be used to move both ways. The elves strictly guarded the location, as well as the method of use, of all elfgates.\nAn elfgate was used by the assassin who slew King Zaor Moonflower. Another elfgate was destroyed within Synnoria on the Moonshae Isles by a rampaging beast.\nKhelben Arunsun guarded one end of an elfgate located in Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep."
