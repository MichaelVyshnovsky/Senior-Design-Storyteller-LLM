Ladles were a sort of kitchen utensil used in cooking and serving liquid foods.
Sharing some similarities with spoons, ladles were mainly used for measuring and serving liquids from pots like soup and stew. They were made from seasoned wood or metal, with a long handle connecting to a bowl-like cup that often had a notch, spout, or lip that allowed liquids to be carefully and accurately poured from it.
