'''Ladles''' were a sort of kitchen utensil used in cooking and serving liquid foods.

==Description==
Sharing some similarities with [[spoon]]s, ladles were mainly used for measuring and serving liquids from [[pot]]s like [[soup]] and [[stew]]. They were made from seasoned wood or metal, with a long handle connecting to a [[bowl]]-like cup that often had a notch, spout, or lip that allowed liquids to be carefully and accurately poured from it.
