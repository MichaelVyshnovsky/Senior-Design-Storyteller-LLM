Drowning Death was the favored weapon of the Faer√ªnian sea goddess Umberlee, wielded by her avatar form.
According to some sources, this trident was a +5 weapon that had the properties of frost, keen, and thundering. While others reported that it was a +3 trident that, while wielded by Umberlee, mimicked the effects of a trident of fish command and a trident of submission.
