        "Description": "[[Araneth Idogyr]] acquired the recipe for Old One Eye from a [[cyclops]] whom he met, and befriended, during the [[Goblin Wars (Erlkazar)|Goblin Wars]] of [[1358 DR]].\n\nSimilar to the brews from [[Calimshan]], this brew had a light coloring but a higher alcohol content compared to its northern counterparts. Old One Eye had a red coloration that developed during the brewing process. The aftertaste was decidedly hot due to its secret ingredients.\n\nIt was considered one of the best liquors one could purchase outside of the [[Purple Hills]].",
        "Prices": "Old One Eye could be purchased in the following containers:\n* Hand keg (15 [[cp]])\n* Cask (1 [[gp]])\n* Barrel (3 gp)\n* [[Butt]] (7 gp)\n* [[Tun]] (15 gp)",
        "History": "The adventurer [[Kendra]] had a mug of Old One Eye at the [[Bold Bard]] in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], in [[Eleint]] of [[1367 DR]].<ref>"
