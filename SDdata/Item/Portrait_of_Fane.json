        "mainbody": "'''''Portrait of Fane''''' was a painting depicting a [[spell]]casting [[undead]] creature, created many years before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This portrait was an exquisite work of art. Its subject was a skeletal creature in a red [[cloak]], enveloped in green swirling spell energy. The undead was so life-like it almost felt like its empty eye sockets followed those who looked at the painting, judgmentally.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Portrait of Fane'' was found within the ancient and abandoned [[Temple of Jergal (Sword Coast)|Temple of Jergal]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], after the structure was broken into by [[Gimblebock]] and his scavenger crew."
