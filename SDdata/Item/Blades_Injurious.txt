'''''Blades Injurious''''' was the name given to a unique [[gem]]-studded ''[[bracer of flying daggers]]'' owned by [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ornate design and many gems of the ''Blades Injurious'' meant it matched Jarlaxle's more exquisite and resplendent outfits. In truth, each gem and ornament worked into the bracer was a reminder of a secret, a promise, or a debt that kept the [[High Captains of Luskan]] under Jarlaxle's thumb.
