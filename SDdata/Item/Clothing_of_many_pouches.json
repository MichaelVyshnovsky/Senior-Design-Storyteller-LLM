        "mainbody": "A broad range of enchanted clothing in the Realms, united by the moniker \"of many pouches\" or \"of many pockets\", referring to their extra-dimensional pouches that allowed wearers to carry large quantities of items. While they could take the form of aprons, or robes, they were most commonly belts or girdles.\nThese items bore a mundane appearance.\nSome of these clothes radiated a strong aura of enchantment magic, as well as a faint aura of alteration magic, whilst others radiated a moderate aura of conjuration magic.\nThese clothes had eight small pockets or pouches. In the case of a girdle of many pouches, these were located on the inner front surface. Within each of these eight pouches were hidden seven additional pouches, totaling up to 64. All of these pouches acted like miniature bag of holdings, allowing their wearer to carry up to  of material weighing up to  within each pouch. Additionally, familiars could be stored within a pouch regardless of its size of weight. While stored a familiar lost their need for air, food, or water. Any other creature of appropriate size stored within one of the pouches still experienced their bodily needs and would only have enough air to survive for one minute.\nWhile worn, the contained items were effectively weightless, but whilst not worn the clothing would weigh  of the total weight of all items stored within.\n* These items were often prized by spellcasters, as they allowed for easy carrying and access of many spell components.\n* Kelvin Delshir owned a girdle of many pouches.\n* Mrella Ironkettle, a farmer in Hundelstone, was always known to wear an apron of many pockets.\n* Shalmaneser owned a robe of many pockets that was stated to be analogous to a girdle of many pockets.\n* Silmarien Silverleaf, a moon elf from Synnoria, wore a girdle of many pouches.\n* Talib the Lich-Killer, a Zakharan deathslayer, owned a robe of many pockets that he used to carry around his many spellbooks.\n* Vhondryl wore a girdle of many pouches.\n* The members of the Jotunslayers, a dwarven adventuring company, were outfitted with jerkins of many pockets.\n* Goldeyes, specialty priests in the Church of Waukeen, had a chance of receiving a girdle of many pouches as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy."
