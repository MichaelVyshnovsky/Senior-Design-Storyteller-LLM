The '''''Eye of the Witch''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[amulet]] from the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The amulet was shaped as a beautiful winged eye.

==Powers==
The ''Eye of the Witch'' possessed magics that boosted the wearer's intelligence and wisdom. Additionally, it allowed the wearer to tap into ''[[divine power]]'' at will. However, the amulet could only hold two charges of the [[spell]] at a time.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, opportunistic [[drow]] of [[House Freth]] uncovered a chasm that connected the [[Elven Catacombs]] of Myth Drannor with the [[Underdark]]. The drow forged an alliance with the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and started plundering ancient elven artifact from Myth Drannor's tombs. The ''Eye of the Witch'' was among the looted magics and it was deposited in House Freth's Treasure Archive. The amulet was stashed among several powerful ancient items, including the fabled ''[[Baneblade Faervian]]''.
