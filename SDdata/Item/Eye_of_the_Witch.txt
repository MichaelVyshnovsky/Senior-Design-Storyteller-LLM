The Eye of the Witch was a unique enchanted elven amulet from the City of Song, Myth Drannor.
The amulet was shaped as a beautiful winged eye.
The Eye of the Witch possessed magics that boosted the wearers intelligence and wisdom. Additionally, it allowed the wearer to tap into divine power at will. However, the amulet could only hold two charges of the spell at a time.
In the , opportunistic drow of House Freth uncovered a chasm that connected the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor with the Underdark. The drow forged an alliance with the Cult of the Dragon and started plundering ancient elven artifact from Myth Drannors tombs. The Eye of the Witch was among the looted magics and it was deposited in House Freths Treasure Archive. The amulet was stashed among several powerful ancient items, including the fabled Baneblade Faervian.
