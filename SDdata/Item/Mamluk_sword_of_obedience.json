        "Powers": "These weapons enhanced a wielder's fighting skill, but their main power was over all human, [[demihuman]], and [[humanoid]] creatures. When struck by the sword, these creatures were charmed unless they were able to resist. Charmed creatures immediately surrendered to the wielder and behaved as if under a ''[[charm person]]'' or ''[[charm monster]]'' spell.\n\nThe wielder did not have to be a [[mamluk]] to use the sword's power.",
