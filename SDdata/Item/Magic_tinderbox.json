        "mainbody": "A magic tinderbox was a tinderbox enchanted for better reliability. It was invented by the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist.\nA magic tinderbox resembled a perfectly ordinary tinderbox, being a set of typical tools for making a fire, including a piece of flint and steel and dry materials to burn. These were kept inside an engraved wooden box to keep them dry.\nThe tools of a magic tinderbox were used in the same way as those of a traditional tinderbox. The flint-and-steel was enchanted to always create sufficient sparks to ignite a fire. This worked in wind and rain, though extreme conditions such as a gale or torrential downpour were too great for proper functioning.\nThe Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist developed the magic tinderbox in the 1360s DR. His technique circulated in Faer√ªn, and magic tinderboxes came to be used by several well-equipped adventuring companies.\nDaltim wrote details of the magic tinderbox and notes for creating one in his spellbook Daltims Tome of Fire, which he lost in Tethyr in the 1360s DR."
