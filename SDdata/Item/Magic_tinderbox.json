        "mainbody": "A '''magic tinderbox''' was a [[tinderbox]] enchanted for better reliability. It was invented by the [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]] mage [[Daltim Flamefist]].",
        "Description": "A ''magic tinderbox'' resembled a perfectly ordinary tinderbox, being a set of typical tools for making a fire, including a piece of flint and steel and dry materials to burn. These were kept inside an engraved wooden box to keep them dry.",
        "Powers": "The tools of a ''magic tinderbox'' were used in the same way as those of a traditional tinderbox. The flint-and-steel was enchanted to always create sufficient sparks to ignite a fire. This worked in wind and rain, though extreme conditions such as a gale or torrential downpour were too great for proper functioning.",
        "History": "The [[Halruaa]]n mage [[Daltim Flamefist]] developed the ''magic tinderbox'' in the 1360s [[DR]]. His technique circulated in [[Faer√ªn]], and ''magic tinderboxes'' came to be used by several well-equipped adventuring companies.\n\nDaltim wrote details of the ''magic tinderbox'' and notes for creating one in his [[spellbook]] ''[[Daltim's Tome of Fire]]'', which he lost in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]]."
