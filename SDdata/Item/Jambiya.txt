Jambiyas were sharply curved daggers common to Calimshan and Zakhara.
The word for "dagger" in Alzhedo was jambiya, yet when most people used the term "jambiya", they were referring specifically to the style of curved dagger found among Calishites and Zakharans.
A jambiya was a sharply curved dagger, almost like a hook. They tended to leave long, narrow wounds in an opponent.
Nearly every Calishite male bore a jambiya at his side.
