        "mainbody": "The Dreamstone was an ancient enchanted item created by the Church of Mystryl during the days of ancient Netheril.\nThe Dreamstone possessed several powerful enchantments. The user of the item could cast several spells stored within. Casting cure light wounds expended a single charge, turning stone to flesh expended two charges, the spell of stonehold consumed four charges, and stoneskin was worth three. At the time of discovery, the Dreamstone held twelve charges. Sages also believed that the creator of the item imbued it with her unique spell that allowed the stones owner to communicate with another through symbolism and imagery in their sleep. However, no one knew how to access this part of the Dreamstones magic, and some even thought this to be a mere legend.\nThe Dreamstone was created by a priestess of Mystryl as a gift for the Church of Jannath in the days of the ancient empire of Netheril. The gift was an act of gratitude after clerics of Jannath aided the priestess named Dreamstone in the development of several powerful earth-related spells. Dreamstone named the magic item after herself and intended it to be used by the Church of Jannath as a powerful protective device.\nBy the , the Dreamstone could be found either lost, discarded, or stolen from the clergy of Jannath by creatures of vile darkness only known as the Fragments of a Corrupt God. The strange ancient shadow creatures were remnants of a long-forgotten evil gods power trapped in a lost temple deep in the Crabs Claw Coast caves on the Sword Coast."
