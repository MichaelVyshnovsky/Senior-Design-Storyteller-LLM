'''Canopic jars''' were a type of container used across many parts of the Realms to store preserved internal organs.{{Cite dragon/300/Shrouded in Death|78}}

==Description==
[[File:Mummy drag300.png|thumb|273px|''A mummy standing next to canopic jars that classically have the likenesses of varied animals.'']]
These [[jar]]s were typically made from pottery, like [[ceramic]]s or [[clay]], or carved from [[limestone]]. but some simply had religious hieroglyphs painted on or etched into them.

==Usages==
Canopic jars were considered to be an essential item for the creation of [[mummies]] and [[mummy lord]]s. After being used to store a mummy's internal organs, the jars had to be kept in the same tomb as it. Some sages claimed that canopic jars stored the life force of a mummy, a relationship akin to a [[lich]] and their [[phylactery]], and that destroying the jars could in turn destroy the mummy whose organs they preserved. Though others argued that this was not necessarily true of all mummies.

Beyond mummification, some used canopic jars simply for the purposes of burial or keeping organs preserved for later magical research, as was the case with the ancient [[star elves]].<ref>

==Notable Users==
* Some kept canopic jars within decoy chambers of their tombs, holding the organs of the servants they had in life. Such was the case with [[Brysis|Brysis of Khaem]] and [[Valin Sarnaster]].
===Creatures & Sentient Races===
* Canopic jars were used in the tombs of the ancient [[sarrukh]]{{Cite LFR/EAST2-1/Marauder's Spear|20}}{{Cite LFR/SPEC2-1 P2/Scout's Honor|25}} such as in the [[Maze of Sseth]].
===Individuals===
[[File:Jarred Mystic Carrion.png|thumb|''Mystic Carrion's canopic jar.'']]
* [[Mystic Carrion]], a mummy lord in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], who hid two of his canopic jars within the [[Undercity]] of [[Baldurs Gate]] and the third in the city's mortuary.
===Nations & Regions===
* In the ancient city-state of [[Cursrah]], canopic jars were kept by the kingdom's [[priest]]s for the purposes of mummification.
* As a burial practice, canopic jars were placed in the tombs of the ancient [[Mulhorandi]] rulers of [[Thay]].<ref>
* Beyond the [[Prime Material]], canopic jars could be found in the [[Domain of Dread]] known as [[Har'Akir]], often serving as mist talismans.<ref> In the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]], they were used for decoration and could be purchased at the [[Corpse Market]].
