'''Breeches''', also known as '''britches''' and occasionally as '''pants''', were a form of outergarment for [[humanoid]] races. They covered the hips and legs, all the way down to the knees.

==Description==
Breeches came in a wide variety of styles, colors, and materials.

==History==
Though the exact date of their invention on [[Toril]] was unknown, breeches dated back to the days of the [[Netheril]] empire.<ref group="note" name="Year">In the adventure module ''[[How the Mighty Are Fallen]]'', which is set within the Netheril empire, players encounter a frozen skeleton in the [[Eastern Forest]] that is described as wearing breeches. Netheril breeches had a style distinct from that of breeches in the [[Present Age]].

In [[1491 DR]], members of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] took up residence beneath a ruined temple of [[Cyric]] in [[Mulmaster]].{{Cite adventurers league/Embers of Elmwood|16}} There they wore leather [[apron]]s and breeches as they worked at [[brazier]]s to sacrifice people as part of a process to ''[[animate dead|reanimate]]'' [[azer]].{{Cite adventurers league/Embers of Elmwood|18}}

==Varieties==
; Cannon breeches: A fashionable, tube-like form of breeches that fit tightly to the wearer's legs. They were usually embroidered in [[gold]], [[silver]], silver thread, or colored silks.

==Reputation==
Up until the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], breeches were generally considered a form of clothing reserved for men. By the late-15{{th}} century it was commonplace for both men and women across the Realms to wear breeches, often of the leather variety.

Some people believed that breeches were a sign of civilized society, at least according to ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue''.
