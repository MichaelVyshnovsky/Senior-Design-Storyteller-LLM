An Ollamh harp () was a masterwork magic harp and the most powerful of the Instruments of the Bards.
Ollamh harps were superior in every way to ordinary harps. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.
Bards wielding an Ollamh harp had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic, in the same way that Anstruth harps did.

Like all Instruments of the Bards, these harps had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing an Ollamh harp could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, confusion, control weather and fire storm each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.
The first Ollamh harps were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Ollamh level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.
Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor.
