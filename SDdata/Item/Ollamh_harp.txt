An '''''Ollamh harp''''' ({{Pronounce|AL|lam|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a masterwork magic [[harp]] and the most powerful of the [[Instruments of the Bards]].

==Description==
''Ollamh harps'' were superior in every way to ordinary harps. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by [[bard]]s, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.

==Powers==
Bards wielding an ''Ollamh harp'' had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic, in the same way that ''[[Anstruth harp]]s'' did.

Like all Instruments of the Bards, these harps had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing an ''Ollamh harp'' could invoke the spells ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[Protection from evil|protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[control weather]]'' and ''[[fire storm]]'' each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.

==History==
The first ''Ollamh harps'' were created by a legendary bard in the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. He used them to test and reward the students of the Ollamh level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary [[New Olamn|bard college]] in its own right.

Over time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor.
