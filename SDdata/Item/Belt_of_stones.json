        "mainbody": "The '''''belt of stones''''' was a unique ''[[curse]]d'' item created by a treacherous and conniving [[sorcerer]] [[Valom]] of the Deep.",
        "Powers": "The ''belt of stones'' bestowed a curse upon its wearer immediately after it was put on, dramatically increasing the weight of its victim. Suppose the belt was put on while underwater, the wearer sank to the seafloor as if weighted down by bags of rocks. Like other cursed items, the ''belt of stones'' could only be removed by an experienced [[cleric]] or via the ''[[remove curse]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "[[Valom]] of the Deep operated out of his floating laboratory, the ship called the ''[[Dim Courser]]'' in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] sometime before [[1281 DR]]. The [[wizard]] \"rewarded\" unwitting hired swords for procuring rare magical ingredients with the ''belt of stones''. Once the belt's curse took place, Valom kicked the hirelings into the sea, where they promptly drowned. However, one such mercenary was [[Herred]] of [[Procampur]] who happened to have a ''[[potion of water breathing]]'' and a ''[[helm of underwater action]]'' on him when Valom pushed him after bestowing the cursed item. Herred survived and returned with a vengeance, accompanied by three [[paladin]]s of [[Tyr]]. Valom managed to kill two of the holy warriors but was slain nevertheless. Later, the ''belt of stones'' was sold to a traveling collector of cursed clothing.\n\nIn 1281 DR, the ''belt of stones'' could be found within the lair of [[marilith]] [[Yxunomei]] in [[Dragon's Eye]] of the [[Spine of the World]]."
