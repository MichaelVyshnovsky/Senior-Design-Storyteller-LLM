        "mainbody": "The belt of stones was a unique cursed item created by a treacherous and conniving sorcerer Valom of the Deep.\nThe belt of stones bestowed a curse upon its wearer immediately after it was put on, dramatically increasing the weight of its victim. Suppose the belt was put on while underwater, the wearer sank to the seafloor as if weighted down by bags of rocks. Like other cursed items, the belt of stones could only be removed by an experienced cleric or via the remove curse spell.\nValom of the Deep operated out of his floating laboratory, the ship called the Dim Courser in the Sea of Fallen Stars sometime before 1281 DR. The wizard \"rewarded\" unwitting hired swords for procuring rare magical ingredients with the belt of stones. Once the belts curse took place, Valom kicked the hirelings into the sea, where they promptly drowned. However, one such mercenary was Herred of Procampur who happened to have a potion of water breathing and a helm of underwater action on him when Valom pushed him after bestowing the cursed item. Herred survived and returned with a vengeance, accompanied by three paladins of Tyr. Valom managed to kill two of the holy warriors but was slain nevertheless. Later, the belt of stones was sold to a traveling collector of cursed clothing.\nIn 1281 DR, the belt of stones could be found within the lair of marilith Yxunomei in Dragons Eye of the Spine of the World."
