        "mainbody": "A potion of sleep, also known as potion of somnolence, was a powerful potion that put the imbiber to deep sleep and was extremely dangerous in its undiluted form.\nThe hazy liquid of the potion was swirled with hypnotic patterns. The concentrated liquid that composed a potion of somnolence created a puff of white mist when the vial was uncorked. It strongly smelled and tasted like blackberries. Drinking the potion made ones mouth tingle as if biting into a mint leaf.\nOne of the types of potion of somnolence was distilled out of dark purple mushroom caps, each the size of a dinner plate. These peculiar mushrooms were found in the Feywild all around Darroch Castle, growing in sporadic clusters.\nBlood of a werejackal was an ingredient of another recipe for the potion of sleep. It could be a telltale sign as the blood tended to  flake in the potions liquid. And some were known to use locks of nymph hair as an ingredient.\nUndiluted, potion of somnolence was an incredibly powerful and addictive substance. Just one sip of the highly watered down soporific liquid (one drop of the potion in a vial-full of drinking water) was enough to send the user to sleep in less time than it took to count down from ten. A typical dosage was just one mouthful and it was enough to last several hours.\nAround 1396 DR, Japheth Donard used a dangerously concentrated potion of somnolence to create a sleeping-aid-like elixir to help Anusha Marhana, a young spell-scarred human noble, to access her unusual power of projecting a ghost-like astral form in times of danger. The ability was only triggered during sleep."
