        "mainbody": "A wand of rotting was a magic item that carried the vile power of the rising rot spell.\nThe wielder of this wand could strike targets with a beam of brown energy that infected them with rotting mold. The mold would feed off of the targets nutrients and moisture, desiccating them from the inside out unless cured with a cure disease spell.\nThese items were associated with the priesthood of Moander."
