        "mainbody": "Rose Scythes of Chauntea were weapons used by worshipers of the Earthmother. They were enchanted with beneficial magic, empowering their users spells and protecting their allies against attacks.\nRose Scythes were sturdy tools carved with the images of wheat sheaves, and whose blades were engraved with the image of a single rose. They could be used as walking sticks and farming tools and could also provide help to divine spellcasters.\nRose Scythes empowered the magic of divine spellcasters, and protected healed allies against attacks from their foes.\nThe first Rose Scythe was crafted over the course of one year by a deva invoker who claimed to have been inspired by one of the rare battles waged by Chauntea in a distant past."
