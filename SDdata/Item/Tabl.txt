The tabl () was a double-sided Zakharan drum.
Pearl divers from the Pearl Cities referred to these drums as mirwas.
These small drums were covered with either horse or goat hides on both sides, though more exotic animal hides could be used as well. Tabls were beaten with the hands or cloth-covered sticks.
The tabl was used throughout the Land of Fate.
