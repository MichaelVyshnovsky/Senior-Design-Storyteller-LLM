The '''''tabl''''' ({{Pronounce|TAB|leh}}) was a double-sided [[Zakhara]]n [[drum]].{{Cite dragon/190/Sounds of Wonder & Delight}}

Pearl divers from the [[Pearl Cities]] referred to these drums as ''mirwas''.

These small drums were covered with either [[horse]] or [[goat]] hides on both sides, though more exotic animal hides could be used as well. ''Tabls'' were beaten with the hands or cloth-covered sticks.

==History==
The ''tabl'' was used throughout the Land of Fate.
