'''''Nameless Light''''' was the name given to a collection of [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]]s created with the blessing of the [[Harpers]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These exotic blades possessed ''+2'' enchantment that aided with both the deadliness and precision of the wielder's strikes with the weapon. Additionally, they were created to fight individuals and creatures of evil nature. When used against those who revered evil, ''Nameless Light'' effectively became a powerful ''+5'' magic weapon that landed additional strikes of lightning when the weapon reached its target.

==History==
Many legends claimed different origins for ''Nameless Light''. One story said a warrior named [[Alesia]] brought the bastard sword from another world among the stars, while another tale talked about a grieving father who forged the blade, and of course, there were those who claimed ''Nameless Light'' was wielded by a famed [[paladin]]. However, the truth was that there existed many ''Nameless Light'' swords, all forged with the aid of the Harpers and, over the years, wielded by many individuals across [[Faer√ªn]]. Sages poetically said that the true power of these mighty weapons was that "they competed people to craft heroes of their own."

As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one of ''Nameless Light'' bastard blades was stored in [[Ammon Jerro]]'s Haven, secret keep of an infamous [[warlock]].
