Nameless Light was the name given to a collection of enchanted bastard swords created with the blessing of the Harpers, sometime before the late 14 century DR.
These exotic blades possessed +2 enchantment that aided with both the deadliness and precision of the wielders strikes with the weapon. Additionally, they were created to fight individuals and creatures of evil nature. When used against those who revered evil, Nameless Light effectively became a powerful +5 magic weapon that landed additional strikes of lightning when the weapon reached its target.
Many legends claimed different origins for Nameless Light. One story said a warrior named Alesia brought the bastard sword from another world among the stars, while another tale talked about a grieving father who forged the blade, and of course, there were those who claimed Nameless Light was wielded by a famed paladin. However, the truth was that there existed many Nameless Light swords, all forged with the aid of the Harpers and, over the years, wielded by many individuals across Faer√ªn. Sages poetically said that the true power of these mighty weapons was that "they competed people to craft heroes of their own."
As of the , one of Nameless Light bastard blades was stored in Ammon Jerros Haven, secret keep of an infamous warlock.
