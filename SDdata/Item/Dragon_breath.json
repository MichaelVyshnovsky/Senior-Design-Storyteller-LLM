            "Biological": "[[File:Themberchaud breath.gif|thumb|273px|''The red dragon [[Themberchaud]] unleashes his own fire breath in glorious motion capture.'']]\nIn [[true dragon]]s, the elemental or magical energies that granted a dragon their breath weapon were said to be generated by the heart and suffused throughout their body within the blood. The source was previously thought to be a large blood vessel called the '''fundamentum''', or '''draconis fundamentum''',<ref> but that merely channeled energy from the heart to a chamber in the gizzard. This organ stored a dragon's magical energies until they were needed to be unleashed as dragon breath.\n\nSome breath types required an intrinsic temperature, which was maintained internally by the elemental or magical energy that flowed through a dragon's bloodstream. While other breath types, such as [[acid]], didn't have any such necessities.<ref> Additionally, dragon eggs were inherently resistant to harm from the breath weapon of their parents, though this resistance waned the closer they came to hatching.<ref><ref>",
            "Magic": "Dragon breath had an inherently magical nature to it. Some believed that the [[magic]] permeating the [[Prime Material plane]] empowered it. as well as [[metallic dragon|metallics]], were each imbued with [[elemental magic]] and their breath weapon was a manifestation of that elemental energy.\n\nSometimes, a dragon's breath could be affected by the magic that permeated within their lairs. Such as clinging to and lingering on those afflicted by it or recharging at an incredible rate.\n\nSome individual dragons and creatures of draconic heritage were capable of channeling the destructive energy of their breath into some other magical or supernatural effect.<ref> For example, with sufficient practice some dragons were capable of shaping their breath weapon into a bipedal, elemental creature known as an [[animated breath]]. \n\nThere were a variety of [[spell]]s that acted upon dragon breath. Such effects included [[compel breath|compelling]] a dragon to exude their breath, [[diminish breath weapon|diminish]]ing a breath's effectiveness, [[suppress breath weapon|suppressing]] a dragon breath entirely, or [[alter breath weapon|altering]] its appearance and properties.{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|94-95}} And some [[:category:draconic spells|draconic spells]]&mdash;that being, spells unique to dragonkind&mdash;required the use of dragon breath to cast, such as ''[[dispelling breath]]''.\n\nThere also existed spells that could protect someone against dragon breath. The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] had the spell ''[[protection from breath weapon, dragon]]''."

        "History": "On [[Toril]], some scholars from [[Candlekeep]] proposed the [[proto-dragon|proto-dragon theory]], claiming that the dragons of their world gradually developed breath weapons through evolution. This theory purported that a common ancestor, [[ignidraco]], developed a digestive tract that allowed them to regurgitate their own intestinal gas and ignite it with an enzymatic, hypergolic reaction in the back of their throats.<ref> The proto-dragon theory went on to claim that the ancestors of [[green dragon]]s and [[black dragon]]s developed their breath weapons from further modifying their digestive tracts.\n\nThere were many detractors to the proto-dragon theory, who pointed out that it could not fully explain the myraid of other elemental and non-elemental breath weapons that dragons possessed.",
