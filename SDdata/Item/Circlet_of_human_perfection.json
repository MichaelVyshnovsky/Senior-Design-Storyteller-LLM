        "mainbody": "A circlet of human perfection was a magical circlet that transformed its wearer into an attractive human.\nThe circlet was made of gold.\nUpon wearing a circlet of human perfection, an attuned humanoid instantly transformed into an attractive human. The wearer had no control over the gender or physical appearance of the human form, so attributes such as age, skin and hair color, and voice, were determined by the circlet. The height and weight of the human form were not far from the human average.\nThe transformation had no effects on any traits other than its wearers appearance. It reversed as soon as the wearer removed the circlet.\nThe goblin Yek wore a circlet of human perfection that he found in Undermountain sometime in . The other goblins in Yeks group resented him for it and believed the item to be a curse."
