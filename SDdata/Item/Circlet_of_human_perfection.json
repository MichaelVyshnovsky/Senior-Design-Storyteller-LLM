        "mainbody": "A '''''circlet of human perfection''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[circlet]] that transformed its wearer into an attractive [[human]].",
        "Description": "The circlet was made of [[gold]].",
        "Powers": "Upon wearing a ''circlet of human perfection'', an attuned [[humanoid]] instantly transformed into an attractive human. The wearer had no control over the gender or physical appearance of the human form, so attributes such as age, skin and hair color, and voice, were determined by the ''circlet''. The height and weight of the human form were not far from the human average.\n\nThe transformation had no effects on any traits other than its wearer's appearance. It reversed as soon as the wearer removed the ''circlet''.",
        "Notable Owners": "The [[goblin]] [[Yek]] wore a ''circlet of human perfection'' that he found in [[Undermountain]] sometime in {{Yearlink|1492}}.{{Waterdeep-time}} The other goblins in Yek's group resented him for it and believed the item to be a curse."
