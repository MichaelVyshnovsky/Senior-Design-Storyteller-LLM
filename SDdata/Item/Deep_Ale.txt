'''Deep Ale''', also referred to as '''Fire Ale''', was a popular [[Waterdhavian]] frothy alcoholic drink reinforced, or "warmed" with grain-based liquor.

==Locations==
In [[Waterdeep]], [[Westgate]], [[Beregost]], and many other places up and down the [[Sword Coast]], taverns sold pre-mixed "warmed" drinks or mixed and served them to-order. "Warming" drinks was a common practice of adding various stronger liquors, usually grain-based, to a drink. That practice was born out of the commonly watered down drinks served in the taverns of the Coast. The spirits used to "warm" drinks most commonly were clear distilled [[potato]] alcoholic drinks of no color or taste.
