        "Descriotion": "These warhammers appeared to be ordinary weapons made of [[steel]] with {{SI|18'|'\"|long=yes}} hafts.",
        "Powers": "''War hammers of phasing'' could be created with two enchantment strengths ''+2'' and ''+3''. Additionally, upon a successful strike, these hammers had a chance of dealing magical ''cold'' damage or ''phasing'' the targets for ten seconds. The phased targets received damage as long as the effects of the magic remained active.",
        "History": "[[1281 DR]], the leader of [[frost giant]]s of the [[Dorn's Deep|Wyrm's Tooth]] glacier on the [[Spine of the World]], [[Joril Frostbeard]] owned a ''warhammer of phasing'' of ''+2'' enchantment. During the same year, a blind [[dwarf|dwarven]] smith [[Tiernon Denthelm]] of the [[Gloomfrost]] ice caverns offered one of these hammers with a ''+3'' enchantment for purchase."
