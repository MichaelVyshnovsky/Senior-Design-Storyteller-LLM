        "mainbody": "Final Word was a set of decorative enchanted throwing knives originating from the kingdom of Cormyr.\nEach throwing knife was engraved with the word \"Enough!\". They were masterfully crafted and were created in a distinctly Cormyrean style.\nThe daggers carried a +1 enchantment and had a chance of silencing a target upon a successful hit. Final Word was not a fierce weapon, but its magic allowed the knives to fly true and far with undiscovered maximum range.\nThe design of these magic blades was evidence of their ornamental or ceremonial purpose in functioning of some fierce Cormyrean school of debate.

In the , Final Word could be found in the besieged small logging village of Shaengarne Ford in Icewind Dale."
