Boots of the north were enchanted boots that protected the wearer from the hard cold and severe weather of the north.
These boots were lovingly crafted using hides of northern beasts.
When someone put a pair of boots of the north on, the boots expanded or shrank to perfectly fit the wearers feet. They offered great comfort and superior protection from magical and mundane cold. As an additional feature, boots of the north never got wet. Those who wore boots of the north could also traverse difficult snowy or icy terrain without being slowed nor restricted while their steps left no tracks in the snow.
The boots of the north magic protected the wearer from temperatures as low as , and as low as  if the wearer was dressed in warm northern garb.
