Potato scone was a common type of potato dish served in the city of Baldurs Gate, the Western Heartlands, and West Faer√ªn in the late 15 century DR.
Potato scones were fried foods, satisfyingly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They were usually served with a ramekin of dipping sauce and a scoop of beans.
As of the late 15 century DR, potato scone platters were served at the Emerald Enclave in the Chionthar Valley, west of Elturel.
