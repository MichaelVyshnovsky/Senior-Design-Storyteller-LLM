        "mainbody": "Mermaid Whiskey was a whiskey exported from Tethyr.\nThis whiskey was described as having a very elegant and refined flavor, with its expressiveness being compared to a bards song. It was commonly sold in a wonderfully crafted blue bottle bearing a depiction of a mermaid.\nIt was sought after by the wealthy in Baldurs Gate and could be frequently found within their mansions. It was also stocked by taverns in the city, notably the Elfsong Tavern."
