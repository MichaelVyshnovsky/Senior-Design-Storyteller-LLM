'''''Rods of passage''''' were powerful [[enchanted]] tools that allowed its wielders to traverse the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] and planes alike.

==Powers==
''Rods of passage'' possessed several potent traversal magics. Each rod allowed the wielder to cast the following spells, one at a time: ''[[astral travel]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', ''[[phase door]]'', and ''[[teleport without error]]''. These rods possessed a limited number of charges. However, each charge simply activated the ''rod of passage''. Once activated, a rod could cast each of the listed spells once. The activation lasted for 24 hours, or until each spell was dispensed. If a wielder attempted to re-cast one of the rod's spells, it exhausted additional charge and reset all other spells, making them ready for use.

When a ''rod of passage'' used the ''astral travel'' function, it allowed for the transportation of up to five creatures, including the rod user. Upon activation of the ''astral travel'' function, rod could not be used again until the wielder returned from the [[Astral Plane]].

''Rods of passage'' radiated auras of the ''[[alteration]]'' and ''[[evocation]]'' magic. Recharging was extremely hard and only wizards of utmost arcane power could successfully accomplish that feat.
