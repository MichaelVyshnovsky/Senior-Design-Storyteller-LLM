A '''''katar''''' was a '''punching dagger''' common to [[Calimshan]] and [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]].

==Etymology==
The word for "knife" in [[Alzhedo]] was ''katar'', yet when most people used the term "katar", they were referring specifically to the punching dagger used by [[Calishite]]s.

==Description==
A katar was a dagger with an H-shaped handle,{{Cite dragon/189/Rhino's Armor, Tiger's Claws|38}} perpendicular to the length of the triangular blade.{{Cite dragon/61/Or with a weird one|21}}

==Weaponology==
Katars were held in a clenched fist, facing away from a user's knuckles, and typically used for either stabbing or slashing an opponent. However, the former was the more common method among its users. It put more force from one's punch behind it, making it capable of deadly attacks.

==Notable Users==
A punching dagger was the favored weapon of clerics of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] goddess [[Isis]].

Katars were one of the traditional weapons of the [[dragonborn]].
