Frost was a weapon quality that could be applied to weapons. Once applied, the wielder could sheathe the weapon in freezing cold.
A frost weapon dealt extra cold damage to whoever it struck, but the wielder was immune from the effects of the weapon. If firing from afar with a frost weapon, with such as a crossbow or longbow, the ammunition would also have the frost effect.
A spellcaster needed the chill metal or ice storm spells to create a weapon with this ability.
Some experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as weapons of frost. 
* The followers of certain deities &mdash Auril, Deep Sashelas, Labelas Enoreth, Mask, Mielikki, and Ulutiu &mdash would receive a +1 frost enchantment from casting the spell weapon of the deity and holding that deitys favored weapon. These weapons were a battleaxe, trident, quarterstaff, longsword, scimitar, and longspear respectively.
* Winters Eye was an enchanted longsword of frost that was lit aflame with multiple continual flame spells as a joke and method of misdirection. It belonged to the commander of the Cult of the Dragon named Ellis circa 1369 DR.
