The seal of devotion was a unique enchanted trinket crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Pikel Bouldershoulder in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
The seal of devotion was a wedge. When Pikel removed the pot that he used as a helmet, he used the wedge to make sure the pot sat level on the uneven ground of the great outdoors. This freed him to focus on whatever task was at hand, disregard distractions, and bring his full druidic power to bear.
* Pikel Bouldershoulder, a dwarf druid to whom Silverhand also gifted the sickle of careful kindness.
