The '''''seal of devotion''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] trinket crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The ''seal of devotion'' was a wedge. When Pikel removed the pot that he used as a [[helmet]], he used the wedge to make sure the pot sat level on the uneven ground of the great outdoors. This freed him to focus on whatever task was at hand, disregard distractions, and bring his full [[druid]]ic power to bear.

==Notable Owners==
* Pikel Bouldershoulder, a [[dwarf]] druid to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[sickle of careful kindness]]''.
