        "mainbody": "An orb of draconic influence was a powerful magic item that allowed a dragon to influence the behaviors of other dragons.\nThe orbs were spheres of dark green obsidian decorated with intricate geometric etchings and gold filigree.\nA dragon could use an orb to subtly influence the behaviors and dispositions of all dragons within . Usually, the wielder would concentrate on a single command or feeling they wished to impart on all nearby dragons, such as \"attack\" or \"friendly.\"\nAn orb also afforded some protections to its wielder its magic both blocked scrying of any kind and discouraged dragons and other members of dragonkind from attacking the wielder.\nOrbs of draconic influence were created by dragons in order to be used against other dragons. Some sages proposed a divisive theory that the orbs could be used to cause a so-called \"dragonflight\", the phenomenon wherein a large group of normally solitary dragons of various alignments would suddenly decide to behave in synchronicity."
