The '''''Bulwark of the Great Dragon''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[tower shield]] created out of bones and scaled of an ancient [[dragon]] by [[Darson]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
The shield possessed potent defensive ''+6'' enchantments and allowed the wielder to expel ''fire dragon's breath'' three times per day.

==History==
The shield's creator, Darson, bragged about killing the ancient dragon himself, using its body to create the ''Bulwark of the Great Dragon''. Such an outlandish claim was believed by very few, however. Most believed that the blacksmith simply came across a body of a slain wyrm and salvaged materials for the enchanted tower shield.

By [[1373 DR]], the ''Bulwark of the Great Dragon'' found its way to [[Hillsfar]] of the [[Moonsea]] region.
