Taco was a type of food found among the diasporas of the Radiant Citadel, floating within the Astral Sea. A variety of the same dish found in various places in Faer没n were known by several names fryhard along the Sword Coast, crunchtart in the Vilhon Reach, hotbite in South Faer没n.
Fryhards found in Faer没n were fried hardcrust thin and flat roundbreads made with corn. A variety of fillings existed, with mince-meats (lamb, rabbit, squirrel) and hot-spiced vegetables, such as fried onions, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, leeks, artichokes, radishes, fungi, and asparagus being the most common. Cheese-drenched tacos were a special variety available in most places. Crunchtarts in the Vilhon Reach and realms south of the Shaar were traditionally covered in sauces.
The foods were born somewhere in South Faer没n, from where it spread via trade routes to Chessenta, the Vilhon Reach, and traveled in a changed form to the Sword Coast, Amn, Calimshan, the Lake of Steam, and Tethyr, where they quickly became a popular new tavern food.
