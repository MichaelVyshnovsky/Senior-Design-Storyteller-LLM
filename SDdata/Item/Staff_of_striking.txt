A staff of striking was a very rare magic quarterstaff.
Staves of striking were made of timber from an oak tree.
Only those with knowledge of arcane and/or divine magic, such as mages and clerics, could wield such staves.
They were magic weapons with a +3 enchantment, and were particularly good at penetrating physical defenses. If a set of armor was prone to being bludgeoned, the staff striking it would act as a bludgeoning weapon, etc.
As did many other magical weapons, staves of striking had a certain number of charges. The staff could expend up to three charges on a single hit. The more charges used, the more additional damage was done.
