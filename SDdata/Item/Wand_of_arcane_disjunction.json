Many considered the wands in poor taste and found it disturbing that some wizards created items so deadly to their kin. Regardless of the sentiment, ''wands of arcane disjunction'' were in high demand, and merchants who sold them were only happy as heated discourse only bolstered sales.\n\nIm the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a magical curio store â€“ [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] of [[Westgate]], was in possession of one of these wands."
