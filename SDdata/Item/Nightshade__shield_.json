        "mainbody": "The Nightshade was a unique enchanted shield that dated back to Myth Drannors glory days.\nThe Nightshade was a small and round shield, patterned with stars.\nThe enchantments woven into the shield increased the wielders defense and reflexes at the cost of their constitution. Additionally, the Nightshade allowed its owner to cast the improved invisibility spell at will. This ability had only three charges.\nEven though the shield dated back to the times before the Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor, the Nightshade ended up on the bottom of one of the many magical waters reservoirs of the Elven Catacombs. The shield was still there in 1369 DR, but the pool was inhabited by a swarm of flesh-eating fish. Anyone who was able to pacify or kill the animals could retrieve this enchanted item."
