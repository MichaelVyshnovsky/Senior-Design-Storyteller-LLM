Drakulwyng was a unique enchanted serrated scimitar from the ancient elven city of Myth Drannor.
Drakulwyng possessed a powerful +4 enchantment to the damage dealt, and that guided the weapon towards its targets. It also enhanced the wielders fortitude, charisma, and physical strength. Additionally, Drakulwyng held four charges of the vampiric touch spell that the wielder could cast at will.
In the , Drakulwyng was excavated by agents of the drow House Freth who allied with the Cult of the Dragon in order to rod the ruined city of Myth Drannor of its ancient magics buried in the Weeping War. The scimitar was locked away in the armory of House Freth within the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor.
