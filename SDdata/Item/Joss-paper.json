        "mainbody": "'''Joss-paper''' was an uncommon type of [[paper]] made and used in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Description": "Joss-paper was made from [[bamboo]] pulp, and embedded with pieces of [[gold]] leaf. A typical piece of joss-paper was roughly {{SI|4|sq in|c|long=yes}} in size. Joss-paper was very difficult to make and only the best paper-makers were capable of producing joss-paper.",
        "Usage": "If ambushed by a [[kaluk]], a [[human]] could bribe the kaluk with a piece of high-quality joss-paper. Kaluks desired joss-paper so much that if offered, they lost the desire to attack the human. Instead they would add the piece of joss-paper to their cape and then find a body of water or another reflective surface in which to admire their cape."
