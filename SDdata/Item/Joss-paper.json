        "mainbody": "oss-paper was an uncommon type of paper made and used in Kara-Tur.\nJoss-paper was made from bamboo pulp, and embedded with pieces of gold leaf. A typical piece of joss-paper was roughly  in size. Joss-paper was very difficult to make and only the best paper-makers were capable of producing joss-paper.\nIf ambushed by a kaluk, a human could bribe the kaluk with a piece of high-quality joss-paper. Kaluks desired joss-paper so much that if offered, they lost the desire to attack the human. Instead they would add the piece of joss-paper to their cape and then find a body of water or another reflective surface in which to admire their cape."
