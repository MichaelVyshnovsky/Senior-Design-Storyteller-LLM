The foresters brush hook was a magical brush hook found in Uthe Lodge during the mid-1480s DR.
The brush hook had a long, straight handle and a hooked blade, similar to a kama.
Despite being a fairly mundane tool, the foresters brush hook was enchanted to adaptively change its material and even alignment in order to bypass defenses and target weaknesses. For example, this allowed it to become silver to a werewolf, or cold iron to a fey, or adopt good alignment against a demon. On top of that, it was simply extremely sharp and deadly.
The blade was recovered from Uthe Lodge, home of the ranger Peron Uthe after he was turned into a red musk zombie by Halsaime.
