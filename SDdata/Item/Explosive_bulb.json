The name given to it for this article is chosen arbitrarily, while trying to stay close to the description of the object. was an alchemical device known in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was a bulb, warm to the touch, and if dashed against a hard surface, it would break and then explode. They were powerful enough explosives to hurl a careless user far away if they were too close, and generated enough heat to set alight flammables in the area. They were considerably more expensive than a [[tenday]]'s stay at a [[festhall]]. The thief [[Gage]] from [[Laothkund]] was known to use them, as of {{yearlink|1375}}.{{cite book/Stardeep|248-249|22}}"
