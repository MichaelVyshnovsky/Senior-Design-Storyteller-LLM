Potions of heal were powerful restorative potions that not only cured wounds, but also could remedy harmful conditions such as blindness, deafness, poison, and many more.
Potions of heal were put into small non-transparent flasks that were immediately sealed tight. The liquid itself was uncannily light and a full flask could easily be confused for being empty.
Potions of heal had a similar effect to the heal spell, it could not only restore the imbiber to full health, but also cure all diseases, most poisons, blindness, deafness, insanity, feeblemindedness, and confusion.
Alchemists worked for centuries to master and perfect the recipe for this potion. Eventually, potions of heal entered into circulation sometime in the 14 century, and could be created or purchased throughout the Sword Coast and islands of the Sea of Swords.
