'''''Potions of heal''''' were powerful restorative [[potion]]s that not only cured wounds, but also could remedy harmful conditions such as blindness, deafness, poison, and many more.

==Description==
''Potions of heal'' were put into small non-transparent flasks that were immediately sealed tight. The liquid itself was uncannily light and a full flask could easily be confused for being empty.

==Powers==
''Potions of heal'' had a similar effect to the ''[[heal]]'' spell, it could not only restore the imbiber to full health, but also cure all diseases, most poisons, blindness, deafness, insanity, feeblemindedness, and confusion.

==History==
[[Alchemist]]s worked for centuries to master and perfect the recipe for this potion. Eventually, ''potions of heal'' entered into circulation sometime in the 14{{th}} century, and could be created or purchased throughout the [[Sword Coast]] and islands of the [[Sea of Swords]].
