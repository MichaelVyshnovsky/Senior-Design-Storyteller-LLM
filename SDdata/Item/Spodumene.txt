Spodumene was also known as kunzite or hiddenite, depending on the color.
Spodumene came in two distinct color families each with their own name. Stones in the pink to purple range were known as kunzite while the emerald-green variety was called hiddenite. Both types were hard, easily cleaved, durable, and produced beautiful large faceted gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.
If this stone was sprinkled with holy water (at least three drops) it had the ability to open wizard locked doors and items on contact. The gemstone was not consumed by this, but the holy water was used up the spodumene had to be anointed for each attempt.
