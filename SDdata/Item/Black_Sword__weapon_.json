        "mainbody": "The Black Sword was a unique intelligent bastard sword from the ancient Imaskari Empire, crafted to aid in the overthrowing of an emperor during its height. It possessed the special purpose of overthrowing tyrants. Made of obsidian, the sword had been used to commit dozens of regicides since its creation. In , the Black Sword might have been in the City of Solon, where it intended to slay Raja Ambuchar Devayam at the first opportunity.\nHaughty and unwavering in its aims, the Black Sword was only vocal in the hands of someone it believed to be worthy of its power. If it was wielded by a person it deemed undeserving, it would remain mostly silent, unless given the opportunity to defeat a tyrannical power. \nThis +3 bastard sword granted a number of spell-like abilities to its wielder. In  they could cast darkness, silence, and dispel magic thrice a day each, whereas in  they were believed to be able to use the first two powers indefinitely and at a higher level. It began to speak languages other than Roushoum sometime between  and . When wielded against a tyrant, its powers were further increased."
