'''''Dazzlers''''' were colorfully decorated and magically mesmerizing [[buckler]]s from the city of [[Westgate]].

==Powers==
The [[shield]] front was decorated with a bright, colorful spiral pattern around a face in its center. The face image's eyes seemed to have been following weaker-minded creatures that stared into them. Bright patterns and simple [[enchantment]] made the wearer of the shield capable of mesmerizing their opponents at will as if by the ''[[daze]]'' spell.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Dazzler'' shields were sold in [[Westgate]], among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's [[Market Triangle]].
