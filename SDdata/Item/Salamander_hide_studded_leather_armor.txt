'''''Salamander hide studded leather armor''''' was a common type of [[enchanted]] [[studded leather]] armor as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
These sets of armor were crafted using the hides of [[salamander]]s, lizard-like beings native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]]. Armorers used the material due to its magical nature, toughness, and malleability greater than that of [[dragon]]hide.

==Powers==
''Salamander hide studded leather armor'' possessed a simple defensive ''+1'' enchantment and offered the wearer resistance to fire. Additionally, items made out of salamander hide were significantly lighter than other items of the type.
