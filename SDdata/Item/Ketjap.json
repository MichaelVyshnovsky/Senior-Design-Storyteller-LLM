        "mainbody": "Ketjap was a condiment found in the Shining Lands in 1367 DR. It was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nKetjap was made by combining mingari from Ulgarth with rare fruits from Maztica. This thick and spicy sauce had a unique flavor, making it a prized commodity in the Shining South. It was a good condiment for otherwise ordinary grilled or roasted meats.\nKetjap was created in Durpar by chefs said to be working in the kitchens of caliphs and viziers. Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue brought it to western Faer√ªn for the first time, where it was thought to come from the lands east of Durpar (that is, Ulgarth)."
