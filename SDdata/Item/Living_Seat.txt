The '''Living Seat''' was one of the thrones of the [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]]. It was situated on the Isle of [[Estel]].

==Powers==
The Living Seat had a number of powers, which could be called upon by the [[mantle (Cormathan)|mantle]] of the [[Coronal]] when they were close by, owing to unique enchantments.{{Cite dragon annual/1997/The magic of Myth Drannor|90}} Such powers included the ability to bar any liquid or vapor, from rain to a [[green dragon]]'s breath, from anywhere within a small area centered on the throne or mantle, and a few [[evocation]] spells such as ''[[flame strike]]''.{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/05-18 Coronal's Thrones}}


==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|241}}, the Living Seat was in [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]'s chambers instead of the isle of Estel.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|5|Prologue}}
