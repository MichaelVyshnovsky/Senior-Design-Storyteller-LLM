        "mainbody": "Chainmail (also known as chain mail or simply chain) was a type of armor used on Toril.\nChainmail was a common form of armor made of interlocking metal rings.\nChainmail could comprise an entire set of armor, or it could be a specific article, such as a chain shirt or gauntlet. Booms Garden sold chainmail chemises (45 gp), corsets (25 gp), leggings (35 gp), loincloths (20 gp), bustenhalts/brassieres (15 gp), and skirts (40 gp). Chainmail was also often used for barding. \nChain shirts covered only the torso, leaving the arms and legs free.
