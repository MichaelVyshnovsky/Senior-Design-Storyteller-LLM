The prismatic cloaks were a set of magical cloaks found in Cormyr in the mid-1480s DR.
The cloaks each had a distinct color, but shared the same design of having the lighter and darker shades of their color party per bend across the cloak, with the shades reversed for the trim.
The prismatic cloaks were metaphorically or literally representative of the Empire of Shades ability to subvert, deceive, and conquer its divided enemies. Each cloak had a particular defensive enhancement that was not shared by the others.
Red
The red cloak warded off fire and extreme heat.
Violet
The violet cloak absorbed electrical shocks for the wearer.
Blue
The blue cloak protected the wearer from extreme cold.
Green
The green cloak absorbed acidic threats.
Grey
The grey cloak dampened thunderous bursts of sonic energy.
The cloaks were found among the forces of Thultanthar in the Storm Horns as Harpers and Cormyrean soldiers fought them around Archwizard Amskars new glacier enclave.
