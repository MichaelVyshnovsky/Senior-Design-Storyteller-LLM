The '''''prismatic cloaks''''' were a set of magical [[cloak]]s found in [[Cormyr]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The cloaks each had a distinct color, but shared the same design of having the lighter and darker shades of their color [[Wikipedia:Division_of_the_field#Common_divisions_of_the_field|''party per bend'']] across the cloak, with the shades reversed for the trim.

==Powers==
The ''prismatic cloaks'' were metaphorically or literally representative of the [[Empire of Shade]]'s ability to subvert, deceive, and conquer its divided enemies. Each cloak had a particular defensive enhancement that was not shared by the others.

Will the spectrum ever mend?

;Violet
{{Quote
|Caught in a Prism;<br/>
The colors suffered a schism.
}}
The violet cloak absorbed electrical shocks for the wearer.

;Blue
{{Quote
|Loyalty betrayed;<br/>
Lured by the shade.
}}
The blue cloak protected the wearer from extreme cold.

;Green
{{Quote
|The rainbow fought;<br/>
But the curse was wrought.
}}
The green cloak absorbed [[acid]]ic threats.

;Grey
{{Quote
|Hue lost, the world stands stark;<br/>
Trapped forever in the dark.
}}
The grey cloak dampened thunderous bursts of sonic energy.

==History==
The cloaks were found among the forces of [[Thultanthar]] in the [[Storm Horns]] as [[Harpers]] and [[Cormyr]]ean soldiers fought them around Archwizard [[Amskar]]'s new [[Amskar's enclave|glacier enclave]].
