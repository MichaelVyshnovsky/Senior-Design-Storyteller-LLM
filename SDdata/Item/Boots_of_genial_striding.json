        "Powers": "These boots' magic was evident when one examined the soles. They warped and shifted akin to [[clay]] being molded by a potter. This magic was the enchantment similar to the constant effects of the ''[[freedom of movement]]'' [[spell]] that allowed the wearer to easily stride across even the most difficult of terrains.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''boots of genial striding'' belonged to the [[orog]] [[Blurg]] of the [[Society of Brilliance]], during his stay within a friendly [[myconid]] colony of the [[Ebonlake Grotto]] in the [[Underdark]]."
