A spectral dagger was a magical dagger.
The hilt was carved from a bone of a creature that had had a violent death. However, it had no apparent blade until the hilt was held, when a "blade" made from light protruded from the bone hilt. It disappeared when released. The blade was insubstantial, formed of blue-glowing energy.
This spectral blade could inflict chill touch on creatures that the blade touched, but otherwise it did no damage, because the blade was not solid.
It was worth around 20,000 gold pieces.
