A '''''spectral dagger''''' was a magical dagger.

==Description==
The hilt was carved from a bone of a creature that had had a violent death. However, it had no apparent blade until the hilt was held, when a "blade" made from light protruded from the bone hilt. It disappeared when released. The blade was insubstantial, formed of blue-glowing energy.

==Powers==
This spectral blade could inflict ''[[chill touch]]'' on creatures that the blade touched, but otherwise it did no damage, because the blade was not solid.

==Cost==
It was worth around 20,000 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Cabrath Nelinderra]], [[drow]] [[cleric]] of [[Kiaransalee]] and second-in-command to [[Irae T'sarran]]
