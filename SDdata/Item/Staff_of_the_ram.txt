Staff of the ram was an enchanted quarterstaff wielded by the High Harper Jaheira sometime before the late 15 century DR.
Staff of the ram hummed and pulsed with energy of its powerful namesake creature contained within. It possessed a potent +2 enchantment that strengthened the weapons blows and aided the wielders aim. When wielded in battle, staff of the ram could knock one opponent  back and stun them every six seconds. However, that magic left huge creatures and dragons unaffected.
Jaherias staff of the ram was created by some unknown archmage who did not leave a crafters mark, nor any other identification on the weapon. At some point in her long adventuring life, Jaheria came across the staff and by the , had it stashed in a small hidden sanctuary underneath her home in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate alongside other treasures of her younger days, such as a Blem from Kara-Tur and priceless Khalids Gift.
