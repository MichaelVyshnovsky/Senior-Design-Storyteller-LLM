'''''Staff of the ram''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] wielded by the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Staff of the ram'' hummed and pulsed with energy of its powerful namesake [[ram|creature]] contained within. It possessed a potent ''+2'' enchantment that strengthened the [[weapon]]'s blows and aided the wielder's aim. When wielded in battle, ''staff of the ram'' could knock one opponent {{SI|7'|'"|long=yes}} back and stun them every six seconds. However, that magic left huge creatures and [[dragon]]s unaffected.

==History==
Jaheria's ''staff of the ram'' was created by some unknown [[archmage]] who did not leave a crafter's mark, nor any other identification on the weapon. At some point in her long adventuring life, Jaheria came across the staff and by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, had it stashed in a small hidden sanctuary underneath her home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] alongside other treasures of her younger days, such as a ''[[Blem]]'' from [[Kara-Tur]] and priceless ''[[Khalid's Gift]]''.
