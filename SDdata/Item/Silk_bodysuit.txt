Silk bodysuits were used by some rogues to eliminate noise generated from armor and clothing.
Silk bodysuits were typically black and made from a special fabric imported from Maztica. They helped the wearer to remain quiet and blend with the shadows.
The only draw-back from wearing a silk bodysuit is that they could not be worn with armor, leaving the wearer vulnerable if they were discovered.
A silk bodysuit could be purchased for 10 gold.
