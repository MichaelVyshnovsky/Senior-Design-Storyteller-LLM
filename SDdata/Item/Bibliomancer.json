        "mainbody": "he Bibliomancer was a magical device that could recall the contents of a library.\nThe Bibliomancer resembled a desk, covered with all sorts of controls. Once it had been linked with the mind amplification crystal, it was accompanied by a glowing blue humanoid shape made from crystal. The Bibliomancers dials could be used to select the first initial of a works author, and the first four letters of their surname. Its sliders could be used to select the works category and script. There was a hand reader that glowed when it needed authorization to access a restricted work it would only accept the hand of a sage. Once a book had been specified, the mind crystal retrieved the book from the library and delivered it to the operator. \nThe Bibliomancer also enforced library rules. When someone in its vicinity broke a rule, such as stealing, talking other than whispering, meddling with the console, misusing it, damaging books, or taking too long, the machine would punish them with a blast. These violent blasts came from the mind crystal, and could seriously hurt. The mind crystal followed the blast by gently scolding whoever had broken the rule.\nWhen the Bibliomancer detected an intruder, or the other amplification crystals in the tower had been neutralized, it would enter danger mode. Danger mode involved the mind crystal running around the vicinity and firing blasts. There was also a red button on the console of the Bibliomancer which could reset the device and stop danger mode. To be reset, it had to be configured to search for a work by A Sage, under General Works and with a script of Other. The title count had to be set to 1. Once it had been set like this, a press of the red button could stop danger mode.  \nThe Bibliomancer was invented by Crannaston, in Candlekeep. He intended for it to categorize books there, but the sages did not want to implement it. When Crannaston stole Sammasters Secret Notes and fled to Chult, he took the Bibliomancer with him. When he met the Mompono tribe and took control of the Silent Tower, he installed the device on the fourth floor, with the library. He connected it to the mind amplification crystal that was already in the tower. \nDuring the events of the death curse around , the sages Octavius and Augustus were sent from Candlekeep to investigate Crannastons activities. With a group of adventurers, they entered the Silent Tower and encountered the Bibliomancer.\nAlthough sages like Octavius were impressed with the usefulness of the Bibliomancer, other sages like Augustus took issue with the strict searching system. If someone did not know all the specifics of the book they wanted to search for, the Bibliomancer was not helpful. This negative view of the Bibliomancer was the prevailing one in Candlekeep."
