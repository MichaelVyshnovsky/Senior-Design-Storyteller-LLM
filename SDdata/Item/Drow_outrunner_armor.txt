Drow outrunner armor was a kind of leather armor used by drow scouts in the late 15 century DR.
The armor was light and didnt provide full body coverage, but was bedecked in straps, pouches, bandoliers.
The protections imbued in the armor made it exceptionally good at keeping the wearer alive in the face of all sorts of threats, especially magical attacks. It also made them immune to most natural poisons, and resistant to magical ones.
Suits of outrunner armor were found in Mistress Laerionvyrs drow outpost in the Stonelands.
