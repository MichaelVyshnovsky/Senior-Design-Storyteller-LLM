Abyssal blades were demonic enchanted vorpal bastard swords forged out of the rarest ore from the deepest part of the Abyss.
This massive serrated greatsword was made out of dark metal and glowed with red radiance of purest malice.
These exotic blades possessed +1 enchantment and the deadly vorpal edge. When these bastard swords were wielded against creatures not native to the Prime Material plane, their magics effectively became devastating +7 enchanted blade.
Due to the rarity of materials used in forging these grim blades, they were only wielded by the strongest and the most important demons of the Abyss, such as balor generals, namely, KazzTemmet. One such blade ended up in the Moonsea region after traveling the planes for a thousand years. That Abyssal blade remained its strong connection to the plane of its origin even past the events of the Order of the Crippled Fang crisis of 1373 DR.
