'''Spiked chains''' were type of exotic melee weapon.

==Description==
Spiked chains were a length of metal chain whose last few links on each end were enlarged and enhanced with spikes. The length and size of these links were usually proportional to the size of their wielder in order to ensure optimal performance. At the half-way point of the chain and/or the midpoints of the two halves, a link of the chain was often replaced with a ring for grasping..

==Weaponology==
Spiked chains were similar to the [[whip]] in that they were a melee weapon with great range, allowing their wielders to attack foes from as far as {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} away. They took two hands to wield effectively and could be used to trip an opponent. The spiked chain was especially effective at [[disarming]] foes by wrapping around their weapon or weapon arm. It took great skill to wield spiked chains without injuring one's self, thus they were typically considered an exotic weapon.

==History==
[[high elf|Eladrin]] duelists were believed to have been the first race to wield spiked chains.

==Notable Users==
* Among [[devil]]s, spiked chains were a common weapon of both [[cornugon]]s and [[kyton]]s. The latter, otherwise known as chain devils, had these chains wrapped tightly around their bodies as a sort of horrific armor.
* Among the [[celestial eladrin]], the [[shiradi]] typically fought with spiked chains.<ref>
* Spiked chains were a common weapon among the standard variety of [[air archon]]s.
* Spiked chains were a common weapon among [[kenku]].<ref>
* Spiked chains were a common weapon among all three of the races known as [[shadar-kai]]. The [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] that were a race of [[fey]], the [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] that were an offshoot of the [[Netherese]], and the [[shadar-kai (elf)|shadar-kai]] that were an offshoot of [[elves]].
* Whenever [[gloom golem]]s chose to use weaponry, they often favored the use of spiked chains.
