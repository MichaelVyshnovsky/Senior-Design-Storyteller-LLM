Daggers of truth were cursed weapons that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
As with non-magical daggers, these weapons were available in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
Daggers of truth did make it easier for the wielder to strike their target. However, the curse of the weapon prevented the wielder from ever telling a lie.
