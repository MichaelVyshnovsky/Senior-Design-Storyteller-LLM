A rod of divergence was a magical rod, or a staff, that protected the wielder against a particular kind of energy.
A rod of divergence was constructed to act against one type of energy and provided resist energy for that type of energy that was designated upon its creation. It could produce faerie fire of any color at will, and once per day, the rod would automatically deflect any incoming spell of the rods energy type within - of the rod, as if by the spell turning spell onto a target within -, provided it can be turned.
When such an item was created, it possessed fifty charges. Redirecting a spell as if by spell turning consumed three charges.
A rod or a staff of divergence could be created by a skilled crafter of encahnted rods with the use of the faerie fire, and spell turning spells.
