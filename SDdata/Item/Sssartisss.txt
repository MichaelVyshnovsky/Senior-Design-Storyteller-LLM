Sssartisss was a mixed poison distilled by the yuan-ti.
Sssartisss was a sticky, transparent liquid. If it came in contact with air, the outer surface would solidify into a thin film with a grooved texture. Below the film, it would remain a fluid and could maintain its potency for decades.
Sssartisss had a tangy flavor. It was distilled from the poisons of several venomous snakes.
When sssartisss entered the bloodstream through injury, it could induce paralysis in under ten seconds, followed by unconsciousness. The paralysis would last between two and twelve minutes, and unconsciousness, if it occurred, could last for up to four hours. All Scaled Ones were immune to the effects of this poison.
Sssartisss was one of only two mixed poisons&mdashthe other being tsous&mdashthat the yuan-ti were successful at creating. Ordinarily, it was very difficult to blend venoms from different snake varieties, because the toxins would negatively effect each other.
