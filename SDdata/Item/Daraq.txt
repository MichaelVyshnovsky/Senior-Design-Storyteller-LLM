'''Daraq''' were the [[Zakhara]]n counterpart to the common [[buckler]].

==Description==
Small, and light, these shields were favored by the desert warriors of Zakhara. Common daraqs were made from laminated hide or tortoise shell, but sturdier metal versions were available as well.

==Prices==
The buckler sold for around 1 [[gp]] and weighed around 2 lb in the bazaars of the [[Land of Fate]].
