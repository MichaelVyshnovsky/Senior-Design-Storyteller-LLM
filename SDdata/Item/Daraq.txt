Daraq were the Zakharan counterpart to the common buckler.
Small, and light, these shields were favored by the desert warriors of Zakhara. Common daraqs were made from laminated hide or tortoise shell, but sturdier metal versions were available as well.
The buckler sold for around 1 gp and weighed around 2 lb in the bazaars of the Land of Fate.
