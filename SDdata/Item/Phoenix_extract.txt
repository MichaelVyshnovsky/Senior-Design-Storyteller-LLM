'''''Phoenix extract''''' was a type of [[potion]] believed to be made out of [[phoenix]] blood.

==Description==
This blood-red concoction was rumored to be distilled out of the blood of a phoenix. Even if this was false, the concoction was still highly valuable and sought-after for its potency and powers.

==Powers==
Even a smallest sip of this elixir protected the drinker from extreme temperatures. When the entire potion was consumed, the imbiber became enveloped in magical protective ''[[elemental shield]]'' that guarded them from both, fire and ice.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], several vials of ''phoenix extract'' were sold by a [[half-orc]]ish merchant of [[Liam's Hold]] - [[Lashar‎‎]].
