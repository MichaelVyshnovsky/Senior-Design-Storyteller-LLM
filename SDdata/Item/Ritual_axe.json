        "mainbody": "Ritual axes were enchanted axes used as weapons and as torture devices by the members of the Church of Loviatar in the late 15 century DR.\nRitual axes were kept shiny and polished, but they ended up splattered in caked-on blood regardless.\nRitual axes possessed the Scourge Mistress bane, an enchantment that affected the wielder and their targets. Every landed slash with the axe had a chance of worsening the aim of the opponent and making them more vulnerable to mundane and magical effects. However, unless the axes wielder was severely wounded, each attack with it cut and bled the wielder.\nIn the , one such axe was wielded by a torturer of Loviatar, Abdirak, who was summoned to the Shattered Sanctum of Sel√ªne to interrogate prisoners of the Cult of the Absolute."
