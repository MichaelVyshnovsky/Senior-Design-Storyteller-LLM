A figurehead of speed was a magical statue attached to spelljamming ships that increased their tactical speed. Although it made the ship faster in combat, it became more difficult to maneuver.
This type of figurehead of wondrous power was a humanoid figure carved from beech. The eyes were beset with two glittering emeralds.
Although this statue increased the tactical speed of a spelljammer, it did not increase its travel speed. It could be used for one hour per week. Once this time was reached, its powers were unusable for a few days.
