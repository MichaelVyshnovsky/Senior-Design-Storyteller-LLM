A '''''quarterstaff of battle''''' was a potent magical [[quarterstaff]].

==Powers==
A ''+3 [[speed]] quarterstaff'', it was also immune to all cutting and piercing damage and gave the wielder a great boost to his or her ability to disarm opponents.

The staff could also be used up to three times per day to deflect medium-sized or smaller projectiles for a dozen seconds, including low-level ranged [[spell]]s. This could be used to protect oneself or an adjacent ally, and the staff was not damaged in the act.

Once a day, the wielder could use the staff to make a powerful "battlestrike". Much more damaging than a normal strike, this attack might stun and/or knock over the opponent.

In addition, the staff could be used once a day to create a ''[[repulsion]]'' effect.

==Cost==
This powerful weapon was worth 162,600 [[gold piece]]s.
