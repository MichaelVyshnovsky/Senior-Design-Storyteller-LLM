A quarterstaff of battle was a potent magical quarterstaff.
A +3 speed quarterstaff, it was also immune to all cutting and piercing damage and gave the wielder a great boost to his or her ability to disarm opponents.
The staff could also be used up to three times per day to deflect medium-sized or smaller projectiles for a dozen seconds, including low-level ranged spells. This could be used to protect oneself or an adjacent ally, and the staff was not damaged in the act.
Once a day, the wielder could use the staff to make a powerful "battlestrike". Much more damaging than a normal strike, this attack might stun and/or knock over the opponent.
In addition, the staff could be used once a day to create a repulsion effect.
This powerful weapon was worth 162,600 gold pieces.
