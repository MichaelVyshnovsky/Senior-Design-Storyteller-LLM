        "mainbody": "A '''''carpet of flying''''' was a wondrous item that had the power of flight. It was a rug that could fly through the air as if affected by a permanent ''[[overland flight]]'' spell.",
        "Description": "Typically, flying carpets were beautifully and intricately made. They typically came in three sizes&mdash;a {{SIAdj|5|ft}} square, a {{SIAdj|5|ft}}-by-{{SIAdj|10|ft}} rectangle, and a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} square.",
        "Powers": "Each carpet had its own command word to activate and could be controlled by spoken words, either from on top of the carpet or elsewhere within hearing range. The smallest size could carry {{SI|200|pounds|k|long=yes}} and still function at optimal capacity. The largest size could carry an {{SIAdj|800|pound|k}} load. Each carpet had average maneuverability and could hover when not moving.",
        "History": "It was said that flying carpets were invented by [[Calishite]] or other [[South Faerûn|southern]] [[Wizard|mages]] as a magical means of transportation that did not involve planar magic since most Calishites were afraid of the latter magics.",
        "Reputation": "''Carpets of flying'' were very common in [[Calimshan]] as a method of transportation, as most Calishites avoided [[evocation]] magic. They could usually be purchased in Calimshan at a ten percent discount relative to other places in [[Faerûn]]. The [[Qysaghanni|Imperial Guard]] of the [[syl-pasha]] of [[Calimport]] owned five ''flying carpets'' with which they patrolled the region around his palace.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Kane]] of the [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]\n* [[Damlath]], the \"Laughing Mage\" from [[Erlkazar]]\n* [[Devane]], the [[Helm]]ite Bishop of [[Maztica]]"
