A '''lajatang''' was a martial arts weapon common in the empire of [[Shou Lung]].

==Description==
The lajatang was a double-headed weapon, having a {{SIrange|3|5|feet|c|long=yes}} long staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. Some of them had smaller barbs coming from the outer edges of the blades.

This unsual weapon required the skill of a martial artist to use effectively. It was carried in two hands.

In [[Kara-Tur]], these weapons commonly sold for 7 [[tael]], but they could be as expensive as 90 [[gold piece]]s elsewhere.

==History==
The lajatang was invented in Shou Lung.

==Notable Owners==

[[Jirozu no Nakamaru]], the [[Wa-an dictionary#O|''oyabun'']] of the [[Big Head]] [[yakuza]] group, owned a lajatang. A monk in [[Aru]] named [[Yaemon]] also carried this weapon, as did the yakuza known as [[Naga (yakuza)|Naga]].

The [[Blue Kumi Bandits]] of the [[Fochu Peninsula]] also kept a lajatang in their weapons cache.

[[Wang-liang]], creatures related to the [[common oni]], were said to sometimes use exotic weapons like the lajatang.
