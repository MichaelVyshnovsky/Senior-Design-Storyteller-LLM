A lajatang was a martial arts weapon common in the empire of Shou Lung.
The lajatang was a double-headed weapon, having a  long staff with a crescent-shaped blade at each end. Some of them had smaller barbs coming from the outer edges of the blades.

This unsual weapon required the skill of a martial artist to use effectively. It was carried in two hands.
In Kara-Tur, these weapons commonly sold for 7 tael, but they could be as expensive as 90 gold pieces elsewhere.
The lajatang was invented in Shou Lung.

Jirozu no Nakamaru, the oyabun of the Big Head yakuza group, owned a lajatang. A monk in Aru named Yaemon also carried this weapon, as did the yakuza known as Naga.
The Blue Kumi Bandits of the Fochu Peninsula also kept a lajatang in their weapons cache.
Wang-liang, creatures related to the common oni, were said to sometimes use exotic weapons like the lajatang.
