A '''''helm of seabreathing''''' was a [[magic]]al [[helmet]] that granted the wearer the power of underwater breathing.

==Powers==
This item was essentially a less useful version of a ''[[helm of underwater action]]''. While it granted the ability of underwater respiration no matter how deep, it had no effect on the wearer's vision or movement while in that environment.
