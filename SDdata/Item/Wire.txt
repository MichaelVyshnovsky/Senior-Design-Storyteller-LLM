lengths of wireThe price of silver wire is presumed to be in error.
Wire was a manufactured length of flexible metal, a "coiled good" alongside chain and rope. It was extremely useful and in wide demand across the Realms for everything from common tools to fancy jewelry to elaborate mechanisms.
Wire was often quite brittle and soft from the drawing process, making it quite easy to snap under the right circumstances. Bending wire more than once in the same spot could snap it, and most wire produced was quite thick to ensure its durability.
Hard metals and alloys could respond poorly to being drawn into wire and become more fragile, while softer metals such as gold were the easiest to draw into fine wire. Adamant in particular was difficult to draw into wire because of its extreme brittleness, and had to be alloyed with molybdenum to make it usable.

Most blacksmiths could make relatively thick wire as needed, but thinner and more delicate wire was much rarer. Crafted by wiredrawers, the expertise and tools required to make good fine wire made it harder to come by in much of Faerûn compared to rope and chain, with the centers of such production found in the Calimshan and Tashalar regions. In many human communities, urban gnome and dwarf artisans pioneered fine wire and chain crafting,

* Wire was coiled on a lathe, then cut to make rings, such as for making chainmail armor. The process of coiling, cutting, knitting, and riveting them was extremely tedious and delicate. Copperbright armor resembled scale armor, and was held together with extensive wiring.
* Cable was an unusual form of woven rope that had a twisted wire core to give it incredible strength.
* As a strong, stiff, malleable line, wire was popular with merchants for tying down loose cargo. 
* Fashionable clothing, elaborate hairstyles and costumes, and accessories such as bustles and stomachers used wire to shape and support their forms, and many forms of jewelry used wire in their construction. The finest, most flexible wire (such as gold) could be used similarly to thread in clothing.

* Combs and brushes often used fine metal wire for their teeth and bristles.
* Small cages for animals and insects could be made from wire.
* Spectacles were made of wire wrapped around the glass lens.

Thread-of-gold was an exceptionally fine wire made by ancient dwarves, though the process of crafting it was long lost to modern dwarves.
Wire was made by the ancient human peoples of Faerûn, including the Rengarth of Netheril thousands of years before , and by the people of Calimshan by -6048 DR.
The consistent production of fine wire in Faerûn was still a developing art by the mid–14 century DR, as artisans continued to gradually refine the process over time. It was expected to still be an area of experimentation and notable improvements through to the mid–16 century DR.
Cable—rope woven around wire—was first developed around the mid-14 century DR.
