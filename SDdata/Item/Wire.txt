'''Wire''' was a manufactured length of flexible metal, a "coiled good" alongside [[chain]] and [[rope]]. It was extremely useful and in wide demand across the [[Realms]] for everything from common tools to fancy [[jewelry]] to elaborate mechanisms.

==Description==
Wire was often quite brittle and soft from the drawing process, making it quite easy to snap under the right circumstances. Bending wire more than once in the same spot could snap it, and most wire produced was quite thick to ensure its durability.

Hard metals and alloys could respond poorly to being drawn into wire and become more fragile, while softer metals such as [[gold]] were the easiest to draw into fine wire. [[Adamant]] in particular was difficult to draw into wire because of its extreme brittleness, and had to be alloyed with [[molybdenum]] to make it usable.

Most blacksmiths could make relatively thick wire as needed, but thinner and more delicate wire was much rarer.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|26}} Crafted by wiredrawers, the expertise and tools required to make good fine wire made it harder to come by in much of [[Faerûn]] compared to rope and chain, with the centers of such production found in the [[Calimshan]] and [[Tashalar]] regions. In many [[human]] communities, urban [[gnome]] and dwarf artisans pioneered fine wire and chain crafting,

===Trade===
[[File:Steel Wire Rings.png|thumb|''Steel wire rings.'']]
* Thanks to the consistent demand, "manygoods" traders tried to keep at least some wire in their inventory, as well as a [[chisel]] and two pairs of [[pliers]] for cutting off lengths on demand.
* [[Aurora's Emporium]] provided common wire by the foot (30 centimeters) in a variety of metals, including [[brass]], [[bronze]], [[copper]], gold, [[iron]], [[lead]], [[mithral]], [[platinum]], [[silver]], [[steel]], and [[tin]].
* [[Gleskur's Finemetals of Secomber]] produced fine, braided copper wire.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}
* The [[Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths]] and the [[Jewelers' Guild]] of [[Waterdeep]] made, traded, and used wire for sculpting and ornamentation.
* [[Mhaer's Alley]] in Waterdeep had a great concentration of shops that sold tailoring supplies, including fine wire.
* [[Rallogar Hardware]] in [[Wheloon]] sold all sorts of tools and supplies, including great stocks of rope, cable, and wire.
* [[Nelzol's Notions]] in [[Immersea]] sold various hardware supplies, including coils of fine wire.
* The [[Chandlers Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] oversaw maritime tools and equipment, including the development of new kinds of wired cable.
* The city of [[Khôltar]] was devoted to metalworking, and the shop of [[Oraundro Nempeth's]] sold rope, cord, twine, wire, tying rings, and chain.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}

==Usages==
[[File:Maillers Lathe.png|thumb|''A mailler's lathe.'']]
* Wire was coiled on a [[lathe]], then cut to make rings, such as for making [[chainmail]] [[armor]]. The process of coiling, cutting, knitting, and [[rivet]]ing them was extremely tedious and delicate. [[Copperbright]] armor resembled [[scale armor]], and was held together with extensive wiring.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/12-11 - Copperbright Armor, Part 1}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/12-14 - Copperbright Armor, Part 2}}
* [[Cable]] was an unusual form of woven rope that had a twisted wire core to give it incredible strength.
* As a strong, stiff, malleable line, wire was popular with merchants for tying down loose cargo. 
* Fashionable clothing, elaborate hairstyles and costumes, and accessories such as [[bustle]]s and [[stomacher]]s used wire to shape and support their forms,{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2008)/09-16 - Women's Hairstyles}} and many forms of [[jewelry]] used wire in their construction. The finest, most flexible wire (such as gold) could be used similarly to [[thread]] in clothing.
* Wire was a common form of ornamentation for all sorts of objects.
* Wire loops were used to store holed [[coin]]s such as the [[authokh]].
* Stringed [[instrument]]s could use metal wire for their strings.
* [[Wired cane]]s used a hard-to-see wire support to facilitate thefts.
* Some [[garotte]]s used a length of flexible, strong wire between two handles to throttle victims.
* Traps could use wire for a strong, hard-to-see trigger mechanism. Specially sharpened wire could be used as a trap itself, especially when stretched at neck-height.
* [[Clockwork]] devices used wire as part of their mechanisms.
* Professional [[lockpicks]] used lengths of wire to manipulate locks, and any short piece of sturdy wire could be used as an improvised lockpick.
* Basic hinging mechanisms could be made from a simple loop of wire, such as in [[sparker]]s.
* Taxidermized animals were often held together with metal wire, and entire skeletons could be wired together to be kept intact.
* Fine woven wire meshes could be used to stop small blades, and found some use in making thief-resistant coin [[pouch]]es, as well as masks for practicing fencing. Larger wire meshes could be used to make fences for animals.
* [[Comb]]s and [[brush]]es often used fine metal wire for their teeth and bristles.
* Small cages for animals and insects could be made from wire.
* [[Spectacles]] were made of wire wrapped around the [[glass]] lens.
* Priests of [[Gond]] were fond of gathering up small, useful bits of junk such as wire.
* [[Loviatan]]s celebrated the [[Rite of Pain and Purity]] by dancing on sharp objects, including barbed wire.

==History==
Thread-of-gold was an exceptionally fine wire made by ancient [[dwarves]], though the process of crafting it was long lost to modern dwarves.

Wire was made by the ancient human peoples of Faerûn, including the [[Rengarth]] of [[Netheril]] thousands of years before {{yearlinkConvert|0|NY}}, and by the people of [[Calimshan]] by [[-6048 DR]].

The consistent production of fine wire in Faerûn was still a developing art by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], as artisans continued to gradually refine the process over time. It was expected to still be an area of experimentation and notable improvements through to the mid–16{{th}} century DR.

Cable—rope woven around wire—was first developed around the mid-14{{th}} century DR.
