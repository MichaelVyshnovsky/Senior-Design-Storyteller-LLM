        "mainbody": "ethek was the name of a runic script used by the Dwarvish language, as well as some human languages, It consisted of letters, numerals and symbols for common words or phrases.\n\"Dethek\" was also sometimes used to refer to the Dwarvish language as a whole.\nThe Dethek runic alphabet consisted of 24 characters. The sounds \"w\", \"x\", and \"z\" were represented by the same character.The Dethek alphabet was originally shown in two sources, Dwarves Deep and the Forgotten Realms Campaign Set (1st edition). The runes for n and o vary between these sources. The images for this article were originally made in accordance with the Dwarves Deep alphabet. However, the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (2nd edition) and Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (3rd edition) both follow the alphabet of the older Campaign Set.\nthumb|300px|center|This image shows how the n and o runes vary between sources.\ncenter|630px\nThe Dethek method of counting used a collection of straight lines, joined together to create a number. This means that each number appeared as a single character. The characters for 1 and 5 were combined in various logical ways to create the numbers 1 to 9\ncenter|630px\nThe characters for 1, 5, and 10 were combined to created numbers up to 20\ncenter|630px\nNumbers from 20 to 99 could be created using logical combinations of the 1, 5, and 10 symbols\ncenter|450px\nTo make 100, simply invert a 10 on top of itself (10×10=100). The rest of the hundreds could be created using combinations of previous symbols\ncenter|630px\nTo make 1000, flip a 10 symbol on its side in front of 100 (10×10×10=1000).Unfortunately, no sources explain how how many extra thousands can be added or what symbol is used for any multiples higher than thousands. This may be because dwarfs had no need to describe any amounts larger than several thousand.\ncenter|400px\nClans and tribes and some of the most common words, races, or phrases had their own symbols. These were useful for sign-posting or creating runestones.\nEach of the main races in Faerûn had a collective symbol assigned to it. The symbol applied to both singular and plural, leaving the reader to work it out from context\ncenter|630px\nOther symbols were used for tracking and signposting. These were hieroglyphics based on commonly understood concepts a foot to mark a safe trail, an inverted helm or drinking horn to indicate fresh water, and so on\ncenter|450px\nOthers were \"Marthammor Marks\", after the dwarven god Marthammor Duin, the Finder-of-Trails.\nDethek was extremely lacking in punctuation.\nThe first letters of nouns and words that began sentences could be capitalized. This was achieved with a simple horizontal accent over the letter\ncenter|630px\nWords were generally separated by spaces. To end sentences, the most common method was a large line or slash across the line.\nTo emphasize or show contrast against the writing surface, the runes could be painted. Names of people, races, and locations were highlighted in red, while the rest of the text was painted black or left unadorned.\nAny numbers enclosed in boxes were dates, written as day followed by year.\nthumb|right|The dwarven [[warhammer Oath-Hammer was adorned with runes stating \"For my sons, Khondar and Khondos\nStonebreaker, slain at the hands of the dark elves, whose spilt blood I will avenge a hundredfold before I die, so I swear before the faces of Moradin, Berronar, and Gorm.\"\nDwarf-written Dethek runes were preferably carved into durable stone, and less often into metal, and rarely written on paper or cloth due to the short life and fragile nature of such materials. Dwarven runes were usually carved or scraped into the stone walls of a building or cave on a cairn, pillar, or standing stone, or inscribed or stamped on metal surfaces such as a weapon. Particular forms of dwarven writing were books of bound metal sheets or on stone tablets called runestones.\nThe simplicity of Dethek runes and their straight lines made carving them into metal and stone simple. Despite this, runes inscribed on runestones were typically written in a spiral-form, from outside in.\nThis example shows Dethek letters, symbols, and punctuation\ncenter|630px\nThis piece of text shows how written stories using the collective symbols can be misinterpreted\ncenter|630px\nDepending on how one wanted to tell the story, this passage could be read in two ways\n#Durlag slew the dragon with ease.\n#Durlag slew the dragons with ease.\nThis example is a partial phrase demonstrating runes written on parchmentThe image is taken from the background image of a number of 3rd and v.3.5 Forgotten Realms sourcebooks. The full text reads \"zhentil keep is also one of\" on the even-numbered pages and \"bases of operation of the zhentarim or black network\" on the odd-numbered pages, with \"the\" presumably lost in the binding. Written diagonally across the odd-numbered pages is also \"forgotten realms magic summoning magic\". In the triangular sigil on page 232 of the FRCS 3rd edition are the words \"good\", \"evil\", \"law\", and \"chaos\".\ncenter|630px\nIt transliterates to \"bases of operation of the zhentarim or black network\".\nDethek runes dated to back to the beginning of recorded history in Faerûn, but it was only one of a number of different runic scripts in use over the centuries, including individual clan codes. Dethek survived to become the most well known and commonly used runic script by the 14th century DR. The others became \"dead tongues\" and were little used at that time.\nStrong links between the gold dwarves of the Great Rift and the early people of Unther led to the Untheric language using Dethek runes.\nthumb|right|250px|Dethek runes were etched onto the entrances of many ancient vaults and dungeons throughout history.\nThe Siremun dwarves of the Firepeaks taught Dethek runes to the Raumviran people for the Raumvira language.\nThe Damaran language used Dethek runes as a result of cooperation between the people of Impiltur and the dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains early in their history.\nSpeakers of the Shaaran tongue picked up Dethek runes from gold dwarf traders from the Great Rift.\nThe following languages commonly used Dethek writing for their written forms\n* Damaran\n* Dwarvish\n* Giant\n* Gnome\n* Goblin\n* Raumvira\n* Orc (Hulgorkyn)\n* Shaaran\n* Tashalan\n* Terran\n* Untheric"
