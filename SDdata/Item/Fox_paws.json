        "mainbody": "The fox paws were enchanted boots designed to provide both defense and agility. They were sized for a halfling.\nThe fox paws were metal, and equivalent to the boots in a set of plate mail.\nA wearer of the fox paws was said to be as swift and sure-footed as a fox, allowing them to move about the battlefield at surprising speed and making them harder to hit.\n* Tommus Tallstep, a halfling fighter and adventurer active in Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR, possessed not only the boots but a matching helmet and armor."
