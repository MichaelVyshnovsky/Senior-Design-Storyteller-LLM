'''''Enkidu's full plate''''' was the [[full plate|suit of iron armor]] worn by the famous [[Kara-Tur]]an warrior [[Enkidu]].

==Powers==
The armor possessed a powerful ''+3  [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'' and offered its wearer limited protection from [[spell]]s and other [[magic]]al effects. Additionally, it offered complete protection from any cowardly backstabbing attacks, such as those made by [[rogue]]s, [[assassin]]s, or the [[Wu jen]]. 

Weaker copies of the same plate mail only held a ''+1'' enchantment and offered resistance to piercing and slashing weapons.

==History==
The first set of these enchanted plate mails was created for a famed and undefeated warrior Enkidu. His combat prowess was so great that no fighter was brave enough to challenge Enkidu. Instead, his enemies used the services of backstabbing assassins, [[ninja]]s, and [[wu-jen]]. ''Enkidu's full plate'' was crafted and enchanted to withstand such attacks. After his death, numerous copies and variants of the magic armor were created.

''Enkidu's full plate'' eventually made its way to the [[Faer√ªn]]ian realm of [[Calimshan]], and came into the possession of the [[Amkethran]] smuggler [[Carras]]. A copy of ''Enkidu's armor'' was brought from Kara-Tur in the {{YearlinkName|1374}} and sold in [[Okuzo's Imports]] of [[Westgate]].
