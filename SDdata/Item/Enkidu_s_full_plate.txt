Enkidus full plate was the suit of iron armor worn by the famous Kara-Turan warrior Enkidu.
The armor possessed a powerful +3  enchantment and offered its wearer limited protection from spells and other magical effects. Additionally, it offered complete protection from any cowardly backstabbing attacks, such as those made by rogues, assassins, or the Wu jen. 
Weaker copies of the same plate mail only held a +1 enchantment and offered resistance to piercing and slashing weapons.
The first set of these enchanted plate mails was created for a famed and undefeated warrior Enkidu. His combat prowess was so great that no fighter was brave enough to challenge Enkidu. Instead, his enemies used the services of backstabbing assassins, ninjas, and wu-jen. Enkidus full plate was crafted and enchanted to withstand such attacks. After his death, numerous copies and variants of the magic armor were created.
Enkidus full plate eventually made its way to the Faer√ªnian realm of Calimshan, and came into the possession of the Amkethran smuggler Carras. A copy of Enkidus armor was brought from Kara-Tur in the  and sold in Okuzos Imports of Westgate.
