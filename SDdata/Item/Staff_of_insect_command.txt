'''''Staff of insect command''''' was a ''[[hishna]]''-[[enchanted]] [[staff]] and an artifact variant of a more common ''[[staff of command]]'' with one major difference in function â€“ it affected insects and insectoid creatures.

==Powers==
''Staves of insect command'' allowed the wielder to cast ''[[summon insects]]'' [[spell]] and a variant of ''[[speak with animals]]'' that allowed the caster speak to insects only. It also allowed them to cast ''[[giant insect]]'' and ''[[repel insects]]'' spells. Use of each spell consumed a single charge stored within the staff. When the wielder expended two charges, they could summon an ''[[insect plague]]''. All creatures summoned or ''[[charm]]ed'' with the ''staff of insect command'' were under the absolute control of the staff's master.

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Mirandos]] of [[Helm]] rediscovered the lost city [[Ixtzul]] in the deep jungles of [[Far Payit]] in [[Maztica]]. She exhumed the grave of [[Greyst]], a [[Revered Counselor]] of Ixtzul, and stole the ''staff of insect command'' created by him. With the use of the magic item, she gained control of the insectoid [[bacar]]s and their queen.
