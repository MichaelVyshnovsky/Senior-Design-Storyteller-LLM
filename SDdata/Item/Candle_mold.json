        "mainbody": "Candle molds were a variety of mold designed specifically for the shaping of candles from tallow or wax.\nSometimes made of wood, these molds varied in the length, quantity, and style of candles they could produce.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold a particularly large candle mold at a price of 12 silver pieces. It could make eighteen tallow or wax candles at a time, all measuring  in length, but required  of either material. The Catalogue lauded them as being favored among innkeepers and custodial priests and advertised them as being capable of keeping a mansion fully stocked.\n* The Glow Shoppe, a store in Ravens Bluff that sold various light sources, kept candle molds in its backroom so that Sul Loman could make the tallow and wax candles they sold.\n* Gulmarin Reldacap, Lord High Smith and Artificer of the House of Gond in Essembra, was a brilliant inventor who made advancements in candle mold designs.\n* The Sharrans of Vanrakdoom used candle molds to create the black wax candles they used all throughout the temple."
