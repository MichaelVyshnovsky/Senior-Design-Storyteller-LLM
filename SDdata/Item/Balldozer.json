        "mainbody": "A '''''balldozer''''', or '''''binphallkahr''''' in [[Quevquel]], was a flying magical transportation device used by [[beholder]]s.",
        "Description": "The ''balldozer'' resembled a giant [[teacup]] or [[bowl]], about {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. When active, it hovered off the ground and had a translucent brown energy canopy with a circular patch of paler energy, mimicking the appearance of a beholder eye.",
        "Powers": "When a [[beholderkin]] settled inside it and uttered the [[command word]], a translucent brown energy field emanated from the hemisphere and formed a complete spherical canopy. The ''balldozer'' moved quickly and protected the pilot, and could violently ram targets with an effect similar to a ''[[horn of blasting]]''.\n\nThe balldozer was not invulnerable, and could be taken apart with sufficient physical damage. A ''[[dispel magic]]'' could also temporarily disable the device for a few minutes."
