Crampons were a tool designed for the purpose of aiding in the transversal of icy, snowy, and mountainous terrain.
Crampons were plates of metal, embedded with spikes and hooks. They were attached to the soles of shoes or boots, or to the side of gauntlets, with several straps of leather.
They were often made of steel and typically sold in pairs. However, crampons could also be constructed from the supplies found in most climbing kits.
Attaching crampons to a pair of boots would increase their traction. This improved a wearers ability to climb up mountainous terrain or walk across icy surfaces. This traction also gave wearers more stable footing on slick and slippery surfaces.
