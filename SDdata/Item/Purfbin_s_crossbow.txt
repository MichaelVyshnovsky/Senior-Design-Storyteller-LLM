Purfbins crossbow was a trusted weapon owned and improved upon by a gnome "professional treasure hunter" Purfbin Doogrick circa 1372 DR.
Purfbins crossbow appeared to be nothing but an ordinary wooden light crossbow that had been often tinkered with.
Over the years, Purfbins crossbow went from being a simple and mundane weapon to becoming a unique and powerful crossbow. Even though its locking grip sometimes jammed, the weapon had a clever rapid-reload spring installed, dramatically increasing its firing speed. The tinkering also gave the crossbow a +2 enchantment, the ability to easily be used in close combat, and, most importantly, the ability to generate a seemingly endless supply of bolts of lightning.
Purfbin famously used his unique crossbow while adventuring with the hero of Daggerford in the , aiding in stopping the Zhentarims plans of taking over the city, stopping the powerful fiend Gorgomorz from laying waste to the city, and rescuing the Duke and Duchess of Daggerford, all while filling his endless pockets with loot and treasures.
