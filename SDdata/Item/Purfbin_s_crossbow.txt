'''''Purfbin's crossbow''''' was a trusted weapon owned and improved upon by a [[gnome]] "professional treasure hunter" [[Purfbin Doogrick]] ''circa'' ''[[1372 DR]]''.

==Description==
''Purfbin's crossbow'' appeared to be nothing but an ordinary wooden [[light crossbow]] that had been often tinkered with.

==Powers==
Over the years, ''Purfbin's crossbow'' went from being a simple and mundane weapon to becoming a unique and powerful crossbow. Even though its locking grip sometimes jammed, the weapon had a clever rapid-reload spring installed, dramatically increasing its firing speed. The tinkering also gave the crossbow a ''+2'' enchantment, the ability to easily be used in close combat, and, most importantly, the ability to generate a seemingly endless supply of ''[[bolt of lightning|bolts of lightning]]''.

==History==
Purfbin famously used his unique crossbow while adventuring with the hero of [[Daggerford]] in the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, aiding in stopping the [[Zhentarim]]'s plans of taking over the city, stopping the powerful [[fiend]] [[Gorgomorz]] from laying waste to the city, and rescuing the Duke and Duchess of Daggerford, all while filling his endless pockets with loot and treasures.
