        "mainbody": "Vale sounders were magical horns used to defend the Welcome Gates in the Visitorsâ€™ Vale on the island of Suj.\nVale sounders were iron horns  in length with a dual-tone output.\nUpon activation, they emitted a shrill screech alongside a deep thrum, creating a cacophony of sound waves that clashed disharmoniously. This sonic assault radiated in a  cone. The sounders low rumble caused the ground to shake intensely.\nCreatures caught within the sonic cone lost concentration due to the horns ear-piercing shriek and became deaf for several days. The silence spell mitigated these effects, although it did not prevent the ground quakes."
