        "Description": "Vale sounders were iron horns {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} in length with a dual-tone output.",
        "Powers": "Upon activation, they emitted a shrill screech alongside a deep thrum, creating a cacophony of sound waves that clashed disharmoniously. This sonic assault radiated in a {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} cone. The sounder's low rumble caused the ground to shake intensely.\n\nCreatures caught within the sonic cone lost concentration due to the horn's ear-piercing shriek and became deaf for several days. The ''[[silence]]'' spell mitigated these effects, although it did not prevent the ground quakes."
