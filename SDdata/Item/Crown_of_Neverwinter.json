[[Rucas Sarfael]], [[Elyne Tschavarz]], and [[Montimort]] used the box to obtain the ''Crown'', but the ''Crown'' was then stolen by Lord Protector [[Dagult Neverember]]'s spymaster, [[Dhafiyand]], who revealed that his true master was [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] of [[Thay]]. Following a failed assassination attempt on Neverember, Dhafiyand was slain and Neverember gained possession of the the ''Crown''. Meanwhile, the box was destroyed, but its emerald golem was recovered by Valindra Shadowmantle, who was able to learn of the ''Crown's'' location from the construct.\n\nThat same year, a noble from [[Waterdeep]] commissioned the creation of a false ''Crown of Neverwinter'' with unknown purposes, although it was later believed that it was done to foil Dagult Neverember's efforts to claim the rulership of Neverwinter. [[Seldra Tylmarande]] obtained the false ''Crown'' shortly thereafter—believing it to be the real one—and used it in her bid to claim the throne of Neverwinter. This false ''Crown'' was magically tuned to Seldra, and if someone other than her donned it, they would suffer the same ice and [[fire]]. This was done to match the legend of the original ''Crown'' and lend credence to Seldra's claim. The false ''Crown'' also had the property of enhancing the power derived from [[spellscar]]s.\n\nThe false ''Crown'' was stolen in the {{YearlinkName|1479}} by a [[Red Wizard]] named [[Tolivast]], who cursed it to make the wearer go mad in an attempt to use the fake ''Crown'' (which he also believed was the original) to advance the [[Thay]]an's agenda in Neverwinter. It was retrieved by a group of [[adventurer]]s. Seldra later used the fake ''Crown'' to try and take control of the city, by using the persona of the \"Lost Heir of Neverwinter\". However, as the false ''Crown'' was cursed, Seldra went mad after using it and the adventurers had to deal with her. The adventurers retrieved the false ''Crown'' for a second time and disposed of it as they saw fit.\n\n[[File:Neverwinter_MMO_-_Quest_-_The_Thief_of_The_Crown_(Cutscene).png|thumb|''The theft of the crown.'']]\nThe real ''Crown of Neverwinter'' was stored in the vaults beneath the [[Hall of Justice]].

The Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge were able to locate the thieves, who pointed out their leader, [[Karzov]]. The heroes followed and killed Karzov, bringing the ''Crown'' back to the [[Protector's Enclave]].\n\nSome years later, the leader of the returned members of the [[Many-Starred Cloak]], [[Gyrion|Gyrion the Ascendant]], claimed to wear the ''Crown'' and therefore to be the true ruler of Neverwinter,. However, the heroes discovered this to be another deception, as the ''Crown'' was still locked in the vaults beneath the Hall of Justice.",
        "Description": "The ''Crown of Neverwinter'' was a warrior king's crown made out of [[mithral]] inlaid with four blue [[sapphire]]s.",
        "Powers": "The ''Crown of Neverwinter'' had the property to protect its wearer from extreme temperatures of cold and heat, and could magically enhance the majesty of the wearer, giving its wearer an advantage when talking with or intimidating someone. The ''Crown'' could also emit a burst of cold and heat to damage the wearer's enemies.\n\nIt said to kill any pretender to the crown. That is, only those of the Alagondar bloodline could wear the ''Crown of Neverwinter''. If someone who wasn't a descendant of [[Nasher Alagondar]] donned the ''Crown'', the individual would be destroyed by a burst of cold and heat. A treatise titled \"[[The Crown is the Key]]\" argued that the ''Crown'' was itself a magical key.",
        "History": "During Nasher Alagondar's reign, Neverwinter became concerned about losing the ''Crown'' after Nasher was injured in a battle at [[Highcliff]]. Thus, the city commissioned the creation of a [[magic]] puzzle box from a [[Red Wizard]] that would be able to retrieve the ''Crown'' if it was ever lost or stolen. If the box's puzzle was solved, it summoned an [[emerald golem]]&mdash;which appeared as a tall woman wearing a vest and trousers&mdash;who could then be commanded to ''[[teleport]]'' to the exact location of the ''Crown'', retrieve it, and return with it. The Red Wizard conspired to use the box to steal the ''Crown'' for himself, but was thwarted and killed. Unfortunately, he had hidden the box by this point, and its location remained unknown.\n\nThe ''Crown of Neverwinter'' was lost during the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]]. Some believed the ''Crown'' was hidden in a secret vault in [[Castle Never]], but only the [[ghost]]s that haunted the place knew for sure.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = A crown?
