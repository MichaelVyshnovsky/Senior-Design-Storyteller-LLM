Spellchain was a type of enchanted chainmail often worn by drow spellswords.
Spellchain was crafted out of an unusually light metal, making it flexible, allowing spellcasters to wear them without losing the ability to work the Art.
These sets of armor possessed +4 enchantment.
In the late 14 century DR, these rare pieces of magic chain armor began appearing in locations within the dreaded Underdark and even reached the Moonsea region.
