        "mainbody": "A wand of sleep was a magic item that forced targets to fall asleep.\nThese wands were made from green willow vines from the Ganathwood. They became as hard as stone once enchanted.\nOnce the command word was uttered, the wand would emit a beam of energy  long that was  wide at the beginning and widened to  at the end. Anything caught within this beam would fall asleep for 3â€“12 minutes.\n*Harkon Lukas, a one time native of Cormyr, owned a wand of sleep.\n*Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes of Candlekeep owned a wand of sleep circa 1368 DR."
