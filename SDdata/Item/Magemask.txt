Magemasks were leather halfmasks with crystal lenses fitted within the eye openings.
Anyone wearing a magemask viewed their surroundings as if under the active effects of a detect magic spell, allowing them to easily spot magic items, hidden runes, and other wizardly writings.
Additionally, the wearer also enjoyed infravision and read magic abilities, though those unskilled in the magical arts would only be able to discern the general nature of the magic.
A magemask could not be worn with any other mask or spectacle.
