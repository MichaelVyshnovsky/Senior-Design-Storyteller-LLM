'''''Magemasks''''' were leather halfmasks with crystal lenses fitted within the eye openings.

==Powers==
Anyone wearing a ''magemask'' viewed their surroundings as if under the active effects of a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell, allowing them to easily spot magic items, hidden runes, and other wizardly writings.

Additionally, the wearer also enjoyed ''[[infravision]]'' and ''[[read magic]]'' abilities, though those unskilled in the magical arts would only be able to discern the general nature of the magic.

A ''magemask'' could not be worn with any other mask or spectacle.
