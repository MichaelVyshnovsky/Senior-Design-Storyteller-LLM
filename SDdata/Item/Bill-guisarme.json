        "mainbody": "The bill-guisarme, sometimes known simply as a bill, was a combination polearm derived from the agricultural tool known as a billhook. It was similar to another agricultural-based polearm, the guisarme.\nThe bill-guisarme consisted of a long pole, measuring around  in length. Over the years since its inception, the design of polearms head went through many iterations. The most common of these consisted of three implements. The first was a sharp, jutting back spike, typically L-shaped and pointing forward. The second was a sturdy hook whose inner or \"concave\" edge was sharpened, as were sometimes its outer edge, to the point of being a cutting edge on the weapon. And the third was a heavy cutting blade, reminiscent of a meat cleaver.\nDue to the variety of cutting and piercing implements on a bill-guisarme, there was a wide range of ways it could be utilized in combat.\nLike most polearms, the bill-guisarme required lots of room in order to be used properly and two hands to wield.\n* Bill-guisarmes were sometimes utilized by ninjas."
