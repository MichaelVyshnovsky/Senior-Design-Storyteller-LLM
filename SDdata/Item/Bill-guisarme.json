        "mainbody": "The '''bill-guisarme''', sometimes known simply as a '''bill''', was a combination [[polearm]] derived from the agricultural tool known as a [[billhook]]. It was similar to another agricultural-based polearm, the [[guisarme]].",
        "Description": "The bill-guisarme consisted of a long pole, measuring around {{SIrange|7|8|ft|long=yes}} in length. Over the years since its inception, the design of polearm's head went through many iterations. The most common of these consisted of three implements. The first was a sharp, jutting back spike, typically L-shaped and pointing forward. The second was a sturdy hook whose inner or \"concave\" edge was sharpened, as were sometimes its outer edge, to the point of being a cutting edge on the weapon. And the third was a heavy cutting blade, reminiscent of a [[meat cleaver]].",
        "Weaponology": "Due to the variety of cutting and piercing implements on a bill-guisarme, there was a wide range of ways it could be utilized in combat.\n\nLike most polearms, the bill-guisarme required lots of room in order to be used properly and two hands to wield.",
        "Notable Users": "* Bill-guisarmes were sometimes utilized by [[ninja]]s.<ref>"
