        "mainbody": "'''''Shimmering''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] with a spearhead on one end, that was hidden within the [[Haunted Halls]] of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''The ultimate irony - a giant in life, bones bound in death.''|[[Merith Strongbow]], [[Knight of Myth Drannor]]}}",
        "Powers": "A staff made out of [[steel]], ''Shimmering'' possessed a ''giant bane'' enchantment that made the weapon deadly to [[giant]]s, dealing additional damage to these creatures, and making strikes extremely hard to avoid. Additionally, ''Shimmering'' dealt [[radiant]] damage with each attack.",
        "History": "Sometime long before the 15{{th}} century DR, a giant was killed by ''Shimmering'' deep within the Haunted Halls. The giant's body was pinned to the ground with the weapon and eventually, time ravaged the giant's body to be nothing more than a massive armored [[skeleton]]. As of the 15{{th}} century DR, the Fallen Giant was still in the dungeon. Anyone who were to remove ''Shimmering'' from the skeletal undead would end up awakening the angry undead giant."
