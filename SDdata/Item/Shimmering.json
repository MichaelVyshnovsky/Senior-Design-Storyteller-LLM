        "mainbody": "Shimmering was a unique enchanted quarterstaff with a spearhead on one end, that was hidden within the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar in Cormyr in the 15 century DR.\nA staff made out of steel, Shimmering possessed a giant bane enchantment that made the weapon deadly to giants, dealing additional damage to these creatures, and making strikes extremely hard to avoid. Additionally, Shimmering dealt radiant damage with each attack.\nSometime long before the 15 century DR, a giant was killed by Shimmering deep within the Haunted Halls. The giants body was pinned to the ground with the weapon and eventually, time ravaged the giants body to be nothing more than a massive armored skeleton. As of the 15 century DR, the Fallen Giant was still in the dungeon. Anyone who were to remove Shimmering from the skeletal undead would end up awakening the angry undead giant."
