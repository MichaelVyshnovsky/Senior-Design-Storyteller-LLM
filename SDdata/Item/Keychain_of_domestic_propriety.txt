'''''Keychains of domestic propriety''''' were handy [[magical item]]s that were first made by a [[Cormyr]]ean [[mage]] that was inspired by a visit to [[Calimshan]].

==Description==
A ''keychain'' was usually made of [[silver]], [[gold]], or [[electrum]] and had six charms on it: a broom, a cloth, a feather duster, a scrub brush, a [[rose]], and a coiled spring. It could even be used for the normal purpose of storing keys. The ''keychain'' also had a variant form that resembled a charm bracelet, usually used by maids.

==Powers==
The ''keychain'' could be activated by touching a token and uttering a [[command word]], one token at a time. Each activation lasted a few seconds, and each token then required a few more seconds before it could be used again.
* Broom: Activated with a "whooshing" sound, it created a magical broom and dustpan which could sweep up {{SI|2|pound|long=yes}} of material. The swept-up mass would disappear along with the dustpan when the activation ended.
* Cloth: Activated by saying "gleam", it conjured a cloth that would rub against a target object, cleaning and shining it.
* Feather duster: Activated by saying "dust", it created a magical feather duster that whisked away dust and dirt from as much as {{SI|16|sq ft|long=yes}}.
* Scrub brush: Activated by saying "rub-a-dub", it created a wet, soapy brush that cleaned away mundane dirt and stains.
* Rose: Activated with a "phew" sound, it filled a {{SIAdj|30|foot|long=yes|adj=square}} area with a pleasant rose scent, and masked any disgusting odors for the duration.
* Spring: Activated by saying "smooth", it smoothed rumpled fabric, straightened askew furnishings, and flattened carpet lumps.

==Notable Owners==
The butler [[Moorefield]] of [[Thistleflame Keep]] had a ''keychain'' to aid in his domestic duties.
