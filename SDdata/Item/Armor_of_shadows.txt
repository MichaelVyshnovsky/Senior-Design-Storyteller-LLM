==Description==
Erik's ''armor of shadows'' was a set of darkened leathers.

==Powers==
This armor held a ''+3'' enchantment and increased speed and reactions of its wearer. Additionally, the ''armor of shadows'' granted its users resistance to spells, spell-like abilities and effects.

==History==
Long before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Weeping War]], the [[Elven Catacombs]] deep underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Erik Sliphand was one of the ancient heroes interred within one of the crypts within the catacombs. In [[1369 DR]], the ''armor of shadows'' was still within its original owner's sarcophagus. Erik's spirit, along with several other heroes' in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the ''armor of shadows'' were to be removed from the sarcophagus, Erik Sliphand's [[wraith]] was there to punish the grave-robbers.
