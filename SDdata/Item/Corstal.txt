'''Corstal''', also infrequently known as '''[[wikipedia:en:petalite|petalite]]''', was a rare mineral and especially hard to find without impurities. They were worn by nomadic tribes and those that could not afford better jewelry.

==Description==
These [[ornamental stones]] were fairly hard but brittle and ranged in hue from colorless to pink. The rare stone that was free of impurities could be [[wikipedia:faceted|faceted]], but otherwise these stones were cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]]. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

==Powers==
Corstal crystals could become light sources for a short time by exposing them to magically generated radiance. Any source of light from ''[[fairie fire]]'' to ''[[flame strike]]'' that touched a corstal gem was mimicked in the heart of the crystal as it glowed with the same hue and intensity for a few minutes before fading away suddenly. The longest duration of this mirroring behavior ever observed was twenty-four minutes.
