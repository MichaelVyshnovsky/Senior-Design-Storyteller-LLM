'''''Infernal tack''''' was a set of magical equipment used exclusively by [[narzugon]].

==Desciption==
''Infernal tack'' was a set of special horse tack. It included a [[bit]], [[bridle]], [[reins]], [[saddle]], [[spur]]s, and [[stirrup]]s.

==Powers==
Narzugon used ''infernal tack'' on their [[nightmare]] steeds. Once equipped, the nightmare dutifully served their narzugon. This bond was forced on a nightmare, as they despised forced servitude. However, some nightmares were known to form a strong bond with their narzugon master. A narzugon summoned their mount by tapping the spurs together or passing them though blood. ''Infernal tack'' only summoned a nightmare who was already in service of the narzugon.
