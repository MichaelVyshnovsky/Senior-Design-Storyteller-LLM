A '''shield +1/+4 vs. missiles''' was a variety of [[body shield]]s that carried a basic [[item enchantment]] for greater protection, especially against projectiles.

==Powers==
These shields offered a ''+1'' protection against most attacks, but were four more times effective against projectiles or hurled weapons. Additionally, they carried a small chance of negating attacks from the ''[[magic missile]]'' [[spell]], though only if the missiles came at the wielder's front-side.

==Notable Owners==
* [[John (Tyrran)|John of Kurth]], a [[Tyrran]] [[cleric]] from the town of [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/At Last, Ravens Bluff|8}}
* Some high-ranking priests in the [[Church of Ubtao]] wielded [[hlang]] equivalents of these shields.<ref>
