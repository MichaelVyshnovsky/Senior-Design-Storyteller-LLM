A shield +1/+4 vs. missiles was a variety of body shields that carried a basic item enchantment for greater protection, especially against projectiles.
These shields offered a +1 protection against most attacks, but were four more times effective against projectiles or hurled weapons. Additionally, they carried a small chance of negating attacks from the magic missile spell, though only if the missiles came at the wielders front-side.
* John of Kurth, a Tyrran cleric from the town of Kurth.
* Some high-ranking priests in the Church of Ubtao wielded hlang equivalents of these shields.
