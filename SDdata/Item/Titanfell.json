        "mainbody": "The Titanfell was the ambitiously-named enchanted sling that was used by Ikathilo of Gond.\nTitanfell possessed a powerful +5 enchantment. Its masterful construction and magics of this sling allowed for dramatically increased critical damage dealt to its targets. Unlike other weapons of its kind, the more physically stronger the wielder was, the more devastating damage output of the Titanfell was.\nNot much was known about Titanfells history. Even though indubitably a skilled wielder could bring down a titan using this sling, it was merely a conjecture that such feat has been ever achieved. However, one thing was known for sure, Titanfell slain quite a few giants over the years.\nIn 1373 DR, Titanfell could be found in the extraplanar laboratory of the famous Gondar invented and artificer, Ikathilo. Even though he was dead, his Mechanus lab was accessible to the clerics of The Purple Portals. Subsequently, the heroes of Moonsea were able to retrieve Titanfell as well as the highly sought-after manuscript of The Art of Golem Crafting."
