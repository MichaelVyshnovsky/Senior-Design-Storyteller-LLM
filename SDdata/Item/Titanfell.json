        "mainbody": "The '''''Titanfell''''' was the ambitiously-named enchanted [[sling]] that was used by [[Ikathilo]] of [[Gond]].",
        "Powers": "''Titanfell'' possessed a powerful ''+5'' enchantment. Its masterful construction and magics of this sling allowed for dramatically increased critical damage dealt to its targets. Unlike other weapons of its kind, the more physically stronger the wielder was, the more devastating damage output of the ''Titanfell'' was.",
        "History": "Not much was known about ''Titanfell's'' history. Even though indubitably a skilled wielder could bring down a [[titan]] using this sling, it was merely a conjecture that such feat has been ever achieved. However, one thing was known for sure, ''Titanfell'' slain quite a few [[giant]]s over the years.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], ''Titanfell'' could be found in the extraplanar laboratory of the famous Gondar invented and [[artificer]], Ikathilo. Even though he was dead, his [[Mechanus]] lab was accessible to the [[cleric]]s of [[The Purple Portals]]. Subsequently, the heroes of Moonsea were able to retrieve ''Titanfell'' as well as the highly sought-after manuscript of ''[[The Art of Golem Crafting]]''."
