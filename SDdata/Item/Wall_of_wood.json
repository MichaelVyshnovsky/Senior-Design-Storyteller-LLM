        "mainbody": "The wall of wood was a magical large shield found in the Cormyrean village of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR.\nThe shield was a large and solid piece of wood, carved with swirling designs.\nThe wall of wood was exceptionally tough and sturdy, and did well at protecting the bearer. It also greatly amplified the positive energy and other sources of healing that the bearer both produced and received.\nThe shield was recovered from Uthe Lodge by adventurers after defeating the wood woads Prinus, Robur, and Falcata."
