'''''Belchorzh's Teeth''''' was an enchanted pair of claw-like weapons, encountered in [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
Some believed that ''Belchorzh's Teeth'' were, in fact, teeth of a [[Chultan]] [[beholder]] [[Belchorzh]]. These claws possessed a potent ''+4'' enchantment and enhanced a [[druid]] wielder's powers. Additionally, the wielder was granted the ability to ''[[see invisibility]]''.

==Notable Owners==
[[Qawasha]]: a [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]] from [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
