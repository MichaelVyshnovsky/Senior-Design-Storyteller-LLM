'''''The Cittern of War''''' was an [[enchanted]] musical instrument that, along with its copies, was the only musical instrument approved to be used by the [[Church of Tempus]].

==Powers==
Those [[bard]]s who stung the instrument could summon ''[[emotion|emotion, courage]]'' twice per day, which made the companions of the bard stronger, quicker, more valorous, and unable to lose their morale in combat. This magical inspiration lasted for an entire hour.

==History==
''The Cittern of War'' was crafted by a [[halfling]] instrument maker [[Relias Blackseed]] before the {{YearlinkName|1013}} and blessed by [[priest]]s of [[Arvoreen]] the Defender. Relias' creation was not made to be used by the halfling himself, so the cittern was sold to the [[bard]] named [[Gallow Deely]]. He used the instrument to make music and songs capturing his adventuring companion's great deeds. One such group was the [[Company of Frozen Trees]]. Gallow used ''The Cittern of War'' to her them overcome a young [[green dragon]] in [[1013 DR]], the event immortalized in the rollicking tune called ''[[The Fight of Green Thirteen]]''. Copies of such instruments were wielded in battle by both churches, of [[Church of Tempus|Tempus]] and [[Church of Arvoreen|Arvoreen]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''The Cittern of War'' ended up in the treasure hoard of [[white wyrm]]s who inhabited the ice caverns of the [[Wyrm's Tooth Glacier]] on the [[Spine of the World]] and led by [[Frostbite (white wyrm)|Frostbite]].
