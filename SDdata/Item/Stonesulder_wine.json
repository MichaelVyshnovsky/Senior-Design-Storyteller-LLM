        "mainbody": "'''Stonesulder wine''' was a white [[wine]] produced by crushing berries and vines found in the [[Abyss]]. It took its name from the merchant [[Arlast Stonesulder]] who popularized its use.",
        "Description": "This wine was yellow in color and had a sharp flavor. Stonesulder wine was often used in cooking because it could bind sauces and gravies to food.\n\nIt had to be fermented in hardwood barrels and, unlike other wines, in a damp and warm environment."
