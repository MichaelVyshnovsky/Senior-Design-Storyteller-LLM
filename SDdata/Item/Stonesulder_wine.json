        "mainbody": "Stonesulder wine was a white wine produced by crushing berries and vines found in the Abyss. It took its name from the merchant Arlast Stonesulder who popularized its use.\nThis wine was yellow in color and had a sharp flavor. Stonesulder wine was often used in cooking because it could bind sauces and gravies to food.\nIt had to be fermented in hardwood barrels and, unlike other wines, in a damp and warm environment."
