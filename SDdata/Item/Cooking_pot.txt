Cooking pots were common pieces of cookware found in Faerûn, alongside pans and cauldrons.
A pot was a deep dish used for cooking food, such as boiling or roasting, and often had two handles and a matching lid. They could be made from plain iron cast into a simple clay mold.
A jingasa was a simple Kara-Turan helmet worn by poor soldiers, which was appreciated for its ability to be used as a cooking pot in a pinch.
* In Thentia, the merchant Dost Birneir sold for low prices brass and clay pots that he had imported from other parts of Faerûn.
* In Waterdeep, cast metal pots with lids could be bought on average for 5 gold pieces, though this price could vary depending upon the size and quality of a pot.
* The harvest cauldron was a magical cookpot (or small cauldron) worn as a helmet by the eccentric Pikel Bouldershoulder, who habitually wore pots on his head.
