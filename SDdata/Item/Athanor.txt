==History==
Over the course of many years, the [[alhoon]] known as the [[Beast Lord]] used athanors of varying sizes to create [[mongrelmen|twisted creature]]s<ref group="note">While the terms "mongrelmen" or "mongrelfolk" never appear in the The Nether Scroll novel, the story does include creatures fitting their description that were associated with Beast Lord, who historically has created mongrelmen. from the [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]] population of [[Dekanter]]. Eventually, it create  a [[human|man]]-sized, egg-shaped athanor made of [[brass]] that was powered by one of the lost ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].
