        "mainbody": "The '''''Eye of Gruumsh''''' was a powerful [[relic]] associated with the [[orc pantheon|orcish]] god [[Gruumsh]], that allowed him to view the [[Prime Material Plane]] from his home realm.",
        "Description": "The ''Eye'' was a giant stone, that appeared to made of milk-colored [[quartz]]. Veins of [[red iron]] came together at the sides of the eye to a large circular iris of [[false gold]]. Within the iris was a pupil of [[obsidian]], that expanded and contracted as if it belonged to a living being.",
        "Powers": "Any person that looked directly at the eye was filled with horrible desires of savagery and lust.",
        "History": "Some time during or before the {{yearlinkName|1486}}, a [[heartwarder]] named [[Joelle Emmeline]] and the Seraph of Lies [[Malik el Sami]] retrieved the ''Eye'' from the [[Hidden Temple of Nishrek]] from the orc stronghold of [[Big Bone Deep]], at the request of the goddess [[Luthic]]. at his underground temple in the [[Underchasm]], to prove that she truly wished him to remain on [[Toril]] after the [[Second Sundering]].\n\nAt the same time, the goddess [[Shar]] sought to separate Luthic and Grumbar, by sharing their dalliance with Luthic's mate [[Gruumsh]] and preventing delivery of the ''Eye'', in order to carry out the [[Cycle of Night]].\n\nIn [[Uktar]] of that year, Joelle and Malik took the ''Eye of Gruumsh'' to [[Marsember]] where they joined up with [[Kleef Kenric]] and [[Arietta Seasilver]]. The group carried the relic across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the lands of the [[Vilhon Reach]], through the [[Chondalwood]], and into Grumbar's temple within the [[earthmote]] known as [[Sadrach's Spire]].",
        "Notable Owners": "Malik el Sami was designated as the bearer of the ''Eye''. He kept it hidden away within an extra-dimensional pocket in his cloak, connected to the [[Fugue Plane]]."
