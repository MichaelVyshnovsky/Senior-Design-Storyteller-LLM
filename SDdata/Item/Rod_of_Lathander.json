        "mainbody": "The '''''rod of Lathander''''' was a unique [[magic item]] that glowed with powerful ''[[daylight]]'' from sunrise to sunset.",
        "Description": "The [[rod]] was {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} long and had a tapered end that flattened into a serrated half-disc. The blades of the disc were embedded with [[rubies]], rose-colored [[diamond]]s, and [[corundum]]s. Removal of any of the [[gemstone]]s would cause them to crumble into dust and the rod's [[magic]] would cease to function until they were replaced with a similar stone worth at least 5,000 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "Creatures within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the shining ''rod of Lathander'' were protected by a ''[[Death ward (spell)|death ward]]'' effect.",
        "History": "Commissioned by a [[paladin]] named, [[Dahaerlin|Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand]], the ''rod of Lathander'' was created within the [[Spires of the Morning]] in the {{YearlinkName|1024}}. The rod was wielded by Dahaerlin in the [[Shadow Plane]] while he rescued the lost villagers of [[Hespheira]]. Following Dahaerlin's death, the rod sat upon the altar of the Morninglord within the Spires of the Morning for over a century until the {{YearlinkName|1136}}, when it was needed again to rescue Hespheira from shadow creatures. The rod returned to its place of honor until the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, when it was stolen by [[thieves]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Following its theft, a rumor persisted of a brightly illuminated cavern in [[Undermountain]] that led many of the Morninglord's faithful to believe it was the power of the ''rod of Lathander''. Several expeditions ensued but none met with success in retrieving the rod."
