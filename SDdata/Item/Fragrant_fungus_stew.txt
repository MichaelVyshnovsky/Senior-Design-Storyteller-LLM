'''Fragrant fungus stew''' was a common dish found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Western Heartlands]], and the [[West Faerûn]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
An expensive and filling dish, [[duergar]] fragrant fungus stew was a concoction of simple and common ingredients that came together in a bright like [[glowcap]] flavor, which was not surprising as glowcaps were among the ingredients.
