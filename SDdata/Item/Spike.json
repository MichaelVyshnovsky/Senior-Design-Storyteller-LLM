        "mainbody": "'''Spikes''' were large metal rods that were pointed at one end (essentially giant [[nail]]s), used in carpentry, construction, and adventuring. They belonged to a class of hardware that also included [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]] and [[peg]]s, and were very similar to [[piton]]s.",
        "Description": "Spikes were most often between {{SIAdj|6|inch|c|long=yes}} and {{SIAdj|12|inch|c|long=yes}} long, made from [[iron]] with a square cross-section. Depending on their purpose they could be made with a simple flattened head, or with an eyehole for looping a [[rope]], [[carabiner]], or some other device.\n\nAside from bolts, nails, and pegs, spikes also had a resemblance to [[stake]]s.",
        "Availability": "Nails were made by blacksmiths as part of their regular work.\n\n''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of spikes and related tools. Spikes could be had in {{SIAdj|6|inch|c|long=yes}} (3 [[gp]]/dozen) and {{SIAdj|12|inch|c|long=yes}} (5 gp/dozen) lengths.",
        "Usage": {
            "Magic": "''[[Hold monster]]'' used a metal rod as a [[material component]], such as a nail or spike.\n\nThe ''[[statue]]'' spell could be cast using a mixture of [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[sand]], and water stirred by an iron nail or spike."

        "Notable Spikes": "* ''[[Blast spike]]'', an explosive [[dwarf|dwarven]] mining tool."
