        "Description": "''Fochlucan bandores'' were 3-string instruments similar to [[lute]]s.",
        "Powers": "''Fochlucan bandores'' were superior in every way to ordinary bandores. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by [[bard]]s, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.\n\nBards wielding a ''Fochlucan bandore'' had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\n\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these bandores had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a ''Fochlucan bandore'' could invoke the spells ''[[fly]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[protection from evil|protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[shillelagh]]'' and ''[[speak with animals]]'' each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.",
        "History": "The first ''Fochlucan bandores'' were created by a legendary bard in the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. He used them to test and reward the students of the Fochlucan level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard [[College of Fochlucan|college]] in its own right.\n\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataer's honor."
