        "mainbody": "A Fochlucan bandore (|audio=Fochlucan.ogg) was a masterwork magic bandore and one of the Instruments of the Bards.\nFochlucan bandores were 3-string instruments similar to lutes.\nFochlucan bandores were superior in every way to ordinary bandores. Like other Instruments of the Bards, they could only be used properly by bards, and could be dangerous if anyone else attempted to play or even carry them.\nBards wielding a Fochlucan bandore had their charming abilities greatly amplified by their magic.\nLike all Instruments of the Bards, these bandores had the capability of storing spells. A bard playing a Fochlucan bandore could invoke the spells fly, invisibility, levitate, protection from evil and good, entangle, faerie fire, shillelagh and speak with animals each once a day, until the instrument recharged its magic at the next dawn.\nThe first Fochlucan bandores were created by a legendary bard in the Moonshae Isles named Falataer. He used them to test and reward the students of the Fochlucan level of his bardic college, which came to be regarded individually as a legendary bard college in its own right.\nOver time, other bards have copied the original design, while retaining the original name in Falataers honor."
