        "mainbody": "'''''Amulets of the master''''' were [[enchanted]] pendants that gave the wearers skills of a master [[thief]].",
        "Powers": "These [[amulet]]s granted the wearer abilities on par with a member of a thieves' guild. Once an ''amulet of the master'' hung on the owner's neck, they became proficient in disarming traps, opening locks, searching for hidden details and mechanisms, their persuasiveness soared, and they gained knowledge of rare items and magics lore. Additionally, ''amulets of the master'' gave the wearer spell resistance.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a [[Harper]] agent [[Ciressa Gind'ra]] infiltrated the notorious [[Night Masks]] guild of [[Westgate]]. Despite being a [[wizard]], Ciressa found a way of giving herself thieving abilities on par with masters of the guild. She created the first ''amulets of the master''. The wizard Harper used the amulet's magics to break into the [[Night King]]'s chambers. However, she did not realize that the guildmaster's private guard had ''[[Permanency|permanent]]'' ''[[detect magic]]'' aura cast on the chambers. Ciressa was captured, betrayed by her amulet's bright glow. The Night King tortured her, and her body was left in a puddle in front of her home. Westgate's city watch very convincingly concluded the Harper drowned in a puddle two inches deep on the city street.\n\nHer ''amulet of the master'' was taken by the guild and replicated to be sold throughout the Realms to benefit the Night Masks. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these amulets could be found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] as well as the city of [[Mulmaster]] on the [[Moonsea]]."
