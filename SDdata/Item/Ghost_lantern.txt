A '''''ghost lantern''''' was a magical [[lantern]] that held a restless [[spirit]], granting it a variety of powers.

==Powers==
The spirit trapped inside the lantern could be ordered by the lantern's owner to shed light. It could also be commanded to perform an activity remotely, effectively emulating the ''[[mage hand]]'' spell. Finally, the spirit magically stabilized an owner that fell unconscious within a distance of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the lantern.

While the spirit remained trapped in the lantern, it could not be harmed or returned to its body as per the ''[[raise dead]]'' spell. However, it could be released from the lantern and into the [[afterlife]] if someone cast ''[[dispel evil and good]]'', which also rendered the lantern itself nonmagical.

==Notable ''Ghost Lanterns''==
* A ''ghost lantern'' holding the spirit of a [[moon elf]] [[warlock]] called the [[Starfallen]] was brought to the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]] sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Coriolis Rillevay]], a [[gnome]] [[sorcerer]] from [[Waterdeep]], brought a ''ghost lantern'' on some of her adventurers during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
