        "mainbody": "Orbakhs bone mantle was odd enchanted garment made out of bone that belonged to the necromancer of the Tower of Bones, Orbakh.\nThis garment was made out of bone-carved disks and spheres that were held together with wire. The mantle was worn over other clothes.\nOrbakhs bone mantle possessed a +4 enchantment to the wearers armor. Unlike other armor it did not negatively affect spellcasting. The bone mantle gave the wearer the ability to cast protection from good once a day on themselves. When this mantle was worn by any creature of good alignment it sapped their energies and experience, and the effect was only reversed once the mantle was removed.\nOrbakhs bone mantle could be created by a capable crafter of wondrous items with the use of mage armor and protection from good spells.\nOrbakhs bone mantle was placed indie the tomb of its owner when her was interred sometime before the Weeping War that destroyed Myth Drannor. The crypt was unsealed in 1369 DR and the mantle, along with Orbakhs ivory scepter, was taken by the adventurers seeking to stop the activities of the Cult of the Dragon and destroy the cults dracolichs phylactery."
