        "mainbody": "'''''Orbakh's bone mantle''''' was odd enchanted garment made out of bone that belonged to the [[necromancer]] of the [[Tower of Bones]], [[Orbakh (Myth Drannor)|Orbakh]].",
        "Description": "This garment was made out of bone-carved disks and spheres that were held together with [[wire]]. The mantle was worn over other clothes.",
        "Powers": "''Orbakh's bone mantle'' possessed a ''+4'' enchantment to the wearer's armor. Unlike other armor it did not negatively affect spellcasting. The ''bone mantle'' gave the wearer the ability to cast ''[[protection from good]]'' once a day on themselves. When this mantle was worn by any creature of good alignment it sapped their energies and experience, and the effect was only reversed once the mantle was removed.",
        "Creation": "''Orbakh's bone mantle'' could be created by a capable crafter of wondrous items with the use of ''[[mage armor]]'' and ''[[protection from good]]'' spells.",
        "History": "''Orbakh's bone mantle'' was placed indie the tomb of its owner when her was interred sometime before the [[Weeping War]] that destroyed [[Myth Drannor]]. The crypt was unsealed in [[1369 DR]] and the mantle, along with ''[[Orbakh's ivory scepter]]'', was taken by the adventurers seeking to stop the activities of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and destroy the cult's [[dracolich]]'s ''[[phylactery]]''."
