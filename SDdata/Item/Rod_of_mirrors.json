        "mainbody": "A rod of mirrors, was a magical rod that protected against gazes and illusions and granted the power of true sight.\nIt gave the holder the ability to make an insubstantial round mirror at its top end,  in diameter, which lasted for eleven minutes, once a day. When the holder looked through the back of the mirror, they could see what lay beyond as with the spell true seeing. Allowing them to see through shapechanged disguises, making them immune to illusion magic, and perceive things that were invisible.\nThe spells darkness, prismatic sphere, prismatic spray, and prismatic wall would all be reflected by it. While the spells alter reality, dispel magic, limited wish, and wish could destroy the mirror.\nThe earliest versions of these rods were only usable by clerics, druids, illusionists, and magic-users.\nThe first of these rods was created by the archmage Glendar, who conceived of it as a means of protecting adventurers from the basilisks and medusae he despised so much. Glendar made twenty of these rods and after his demise the knowledge of how to create them was lost for quite some time.\nCrafting such a rod required the spells obscuring mist and true seeing. Each was worth around 40,000 gold pieces around 1372 DR."
