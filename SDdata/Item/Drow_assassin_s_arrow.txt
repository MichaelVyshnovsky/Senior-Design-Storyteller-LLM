Drow assassins arrows were powerful arrows created for the use of drow assassins of House Freth.
Drow assassins arrows were slightly heavier than regular arrows and were tipped with adamantine.
Drow assassins arrows were brought to the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR. The assassins of House Freth armed with the deadly missiles were dispatched to eliminate the competing drow House Kilsek and a group of adventurers from Phlan that were active in the ruins and the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor.
