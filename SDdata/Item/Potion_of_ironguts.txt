Potions of ironguts were magical concoctions that increased imbibers protection against poisons.
These potions functioned similarly to the ironguts spell, magically increasing the drinkers fortitude and their defenses against all types of poisons.
Circa 1372 DR, potions of ironguts could be found sold in the Hellbreath Tavern in Cania of the Nine Hells. The same year, a single bottle of this potion could be found among the "junk" available for sale at Torleths Treasures in Gillians Hill.
Circa 1373 DR, the Zhentarim Enclave created and distributed several minor magical items, including potions of ironguts.
*Mordak Brelliar one of the apprentices of First Lord Maalthiir of Hillsfar, aligned with the Zhentarim circa 1373 DR.
