'''''Potions of ironguts''''' were magical concoctions that increased imbiber's protection against [[poison]]s.

==Powers==
These [[potion]]s functioned similarly to the ''[[ironguts]]'' spell, magically increasing the drinker's fortitude and their defenses against all types of poisons.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], ''potions of ironguts'' could be found sold in the [[Hellbreath Tavern]] in [[Cania]] of the [[Nine Hells]]. The same year, a single bottle of this potion could be found among the "junk" available for sale at [[Torleth's Treasures]] in [[Gillian's Hill]].

''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] Enclave created and distributed several minor magical items, including ''potions of ironguts''.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Mordak Brelliar]]: one of the apprentices of First Lord [[Maalthiir]] of Hillsfar, aligned with the Zhentarim ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].
