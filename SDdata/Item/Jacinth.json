        "mainbody": "Unique to the Realms, '''jacinth''', also known as '''hyacinth''' and '''flamegem''', was a [[wikipedia:en:corundum|corundum]] gemstone similar to [[sapphire]].",
        "Description": "This rare [[jewels|jewel]] had a fiery orange hue and was as hard and durable as sapphire and [[ruby]]. Each stone had a heart of fire that flickered like a candle&mdash;bright enough to be seen in the dark but not enough to illuminate even nearby objects. This property made it highly prized for adornment on cloaks and gowns worn by the well-to-do. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000&nbsp;gp",
        "Powers": "Powdered jacinth was used in potions and in the immersions used for the creation of magic items that provided protection against fire.\nWhole jacinths were used in the ornamentation of such devices, ''e.g.'', a ''[[ring of fire resistance]]''.",
        "Reputation": "Jacinth was considered a prized gem among the [[drow]] and was favored in particular by their [[wizard]]s.",
        "Notable Jacinths": "* Half of the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' were inlaid with tiny jacinths, making the \"red set\". The \"green set\" pieces were inlaid with [[beljuril]] shards."
