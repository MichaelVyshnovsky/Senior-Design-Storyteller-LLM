        "Description": "A ladder was basically two parallel wooden poles connected by a series of evenly-spaced rungs. It was used by leaning it against a wall, and once in place it allowed the user to reach the higher vantage point. A ladder could also be set horizontally across a gap, creating a simple bridge, though they did not bear the weight as easily then.\n\nExceptionally large ladders used for scaling castle walls were known as '''siege ladders'''. Though a simple and direct solution, siege ladders were highly dependent on the defenders being taken by surprise or otherwise distracted, often in conjunction with other [[siege engine]]s.\n\n[[Rope ladder]]s were flexible and able to be bundled up, while [[spider poles]] were a collection of metal rods that could be assembled into a climbing frame. The [[ladder of Elminster]] was a performer's piece that could stand up without support.",
        "Availability": "[[File:Ladder Aurora.jpg|thumb|''Aurora's ladder.'']]\n''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of ladders for the discerning climber which could support {{SI|500|lb|k|long=yes}} vertically and {{SI|400|lb|k|long=yes}} horizontally. They were made of [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and came in {{SIAdj|2|ft|long=yes}} (7 [[sp]]), {{SIAdj|6|ft|long=yes}} 3 [[gp]], {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} (5 gp), and {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} (10 gp) lengths. For an addition gold piece, the 10\" and 20\" ladders could be fitted with [[hook]]s that allowed them to be connected to each other or hung from windows and roofs.",
        "Magic": "If one was unable to procure a ladder, then the ''[[Ladder (spell)|ladder]]'', ''[[smoke ladder]]'', or ''[[force ladder]]'' spells would allow an ambitious spellcaster to imitate their power."
