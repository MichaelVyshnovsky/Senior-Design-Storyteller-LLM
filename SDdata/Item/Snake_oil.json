        "Powers": "When ''snake oil'' was used to anoint special types of green [[candle]]s, they turned into magical curative items. One such candle could be burned to heal any [[disease]] of affliction, similarly to the ''[[cure disease]]'' spell. Each vial of ''snake oil'' held enough to anoint three green candles. Each candle could cure up to four creatures who inhaled its vapors. ''Snake oil'' was ineffective against magical afflictions, such as [[lycanthropy]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Crawl|14}}\n\nThe entirety of a vial could also be swallowed. When done so, it acted akin to the ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell. When it was rubbed into a wound, it could offer some limited healing.{{Cite organized play/LC/Big Trouble/Certificates}}",
        "History": "A vial of ''snake oil'' was recovered from the buried and abandoned [[Temple of Lolth (Mossbridges)|Temple of Lolth]] near the trail that led to the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. The wizard named [[Tromor Zemhired]] hired a team of adventurers from [[Ravens Bluff]] to delve into the ruined temple's depths. ''Snake oil'' and three special green candles were found wrapped in [[silk]] and guarded by a [[raggamoffyn]]."
