        "mainbody": "Rings of power were pieces of protective enchanted jewelry that gained popularity in the late 14 century DR across the Sword Coast North.\nThese enchanted ring were created of two types regular rings of power and lesser rings of power. The lesser variation simply granted the wearer magical defenses against cold, electricity, and fire harm as well as the powers of regeneration. Regular rings of power granted significantly more potent magical defenses, regeneration, and gave the wearer the boon of freedom.\nOriginally, rings of power created on the behest of Mynseril Lostbone a powerful Malarite priest. He cherished blood-soaked brawls and wanted to find a way to prolong the ferocious pleasure. Mynseril started studying trolls and their uncanny regenerative powers, eventually coming up with the idea to outfit the most savage warriors with regenerative magics. Mynseril Lostbone commissioned the creation of rings of power and routinely gifted them to the strongest warriors from opposing factions who were to meet on the battlefield against each other.\nIn 1372 DR, regular and lesser rings of power were available for purchase in the Temple of Tyr of Port Llast, from cleric named Neurik and later in Beorunnas Well. The same year, Oleff Uskar of the Hall of Justice in Neverwinter offered these rings to his allies in the war with Luskan.\nCirca 1372 DR, several powerful magical items were brought to Toril by a planeswalking wizard Vejoni H. Wyzz who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of Liams Hold. Lesser rings of power could be found in his collection."
