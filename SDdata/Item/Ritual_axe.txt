'''''Ritual axes''''' were [[enchanted]] [[axe]]s used as weapons and as torture devices by the members of the [[Church of Loviatar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Ritual axes'' were kept shiny and polished, but they ended up splattered in caked-on blood regardless.

==Powers==
''Ritual axes'' possessed ''the Scourge Mistress' bane'', an enchantment that affected the wielder and their targets. Every landed slash with the axe had a chance of worsening the aim of the opponent and making them more vulnerable to mundane and magical effects. However, unless the axe's wielder was severely wounded, each attack with it cut and bled the wielder.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, one such axe was wielded by a torturer of [[Loviatar]], [[Abdirak]], who was summoned to the [[Shattered Sanctum]] of [[Sel√ªne]] to interrogate prisoners of the [[Cult of the Absolute]].
