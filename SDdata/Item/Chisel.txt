A chisel was a simple and useful tool found in the Realms. One particular variation of it was called a graver.
A chisel resembled a metal rod with a knife-like wedge at one end, able to be driven into material with a hammer-blow.
Chisels could be used in almost every trade that required material to be cut, etched, or chipped away, including metalworking,
A variation called tatami nomi was used by ninjas to chisel away the wood around locks.
