'''''Rhondang''''' was a powerful [[magic]]al [[warhammer]] and the chosen [[weapon]] of [[Flandal Steelskin]].<ref name=frcs-3e-p240">

==Description==
''Rhondang'' was made of [[mithril]] and was coated with [[gold]]. Instead of a flat back, it had an [[axe]]-blade on its back.

==Powers==
This warhammer had a ''+5'' enchantment. Creatures that made use of cold-based attacks or lived in cold places were vulnerable to this [[weapon]]. On the other hand, the weapon spoke the [[language]]s of every [[fire]]-using creature, such as [[fire elemental]]s.

Flandal's favored weapon was able to launch a ''[[fireball]]'' every minute, as well as burst into a flame at will.
