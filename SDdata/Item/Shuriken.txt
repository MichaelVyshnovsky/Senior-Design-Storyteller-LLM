A '''shuriken''' was a small bladed throwing weapon.

==Description==
A piece of sharpened metal, there were many sizes and shapes in use, but there were three main kinds of shuriken: the spike, the small star, and the large star. The spike was simply a large pin that tapered to a sharp point. A star could have three to eight razor-edged points; the design ensured that at least one point would strike a target.

==Weaponlogy==
A shuriken could only be used as a throwing weapon, thrown with the hand, and was not used in melee. It inflicted small piercing injuries. Their effective range was quite short; typically {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.

Owing to their small size, shuriken were easy to conceal, being tucked within [[sash]]es or folds of clothing. The spike shuriken could even be worn as a pin in the hair.

==Training==
The shuriken was an exotic weapon that required special training to use effectively. It was commonly wielded by [[monk]]s, who could use it with their special martial arts techniques. However, they were primarily used by [[ninja]].

==Notable shurikens==
* ''[[Stars of Ojy-do]]''
* ''[[Throwing Stars of Ojy-do]]''

==Notable Users of Shurikens==
===Religion===
* [[Monk]]s within the [[Dark Moon heresy]] were known to be capable of manifesting shurikens from the shadows.
* The shuriken was the favored weapon of the deity [[Mystra]]. The knights that served in the Mystran [[Order of the Blue Moon]] referred to shuriken as '''whirlstars'''. Shurikens were also a favored weapon of the goddesses [[Lliira]] and [[Tymora]].
