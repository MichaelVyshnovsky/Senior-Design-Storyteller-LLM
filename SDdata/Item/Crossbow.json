A pair of them could be wielded and fired simultaneously, but two hands were required in order to reload each light crossbow, usually by inserting a bolt and pulling a lever. They typically cost around 35 [[gp]].",

            "Repeating Crossbow": "Repeating crossbows were available in both light and heavy varieties, and held a case of five bolts. Two hands were required to operate the repeating crossbow, owing to the need to draw the bow each time a bolt was fired.\n\nA light repeating crossbow cost around 250 gold pieces, whereas a heavy repeating crossbow cost around 400 gold pieces.\n\nAn [[enchanted]] variety of ''repeating crossbows'' existed in the [[Moonsea]] region. These enchanted ''+3'' light crossbows gave its users the boon of ''[[haste]]'' that not only affected the crossbow's firing speed, but also the wielders movement speed.\n\nThere also existed the [[chu-ko-nu]], a variety of light repeating crossbows unique to the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].",
            "Double Crossbow": "A crossbow that had another crossbow built just above the foregrip.{{cite web/Kobolds: Playing to their Strengths}} Though it could shoot two bolts at the same time, some of them had reduced range relative to single crossbows.\n\nThe [[Yawning Portal]] staff had a heavy double crossbow for protection."
        },
        "Ammunition": "Crossbows of all sizes fired bolts, otherwise known as quarrels. Though shaped like arrows, their shafts were much thicker and shorter. Bolts used in active warfare would often had conical or pyramidal-shaped heads. Ten bolts usually cost around 1 gold piece, while a case of five bolts for a repeating crossbow of any size typically cost the same amount."
