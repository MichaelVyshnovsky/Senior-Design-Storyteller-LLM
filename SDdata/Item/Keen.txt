'''''Keen''''' was a magical [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be added to any bladed weapon, making it more deadly.

==Creation==
Applying the ''keen'' property required the spell ''[[keen edge]]''. Only an edged or pointed weapon could be so enhanced.

==Abilities==
It made a weapon magically sharp, making the wielder more likely to inflict wounding, critical cuts.

==History==
Keen magic such as this was first invented by the old noble houses of the [[elf]] realm of [[Cormanthyr]]. By [[1372 DR]], this legacy survived in the ''[[Cormanthyrian elfblade]]s'', ''keen'' [[longsword]]s that carried the symbols of these houses.

==Examples==
* ''[[Cormanthyrian elfblade]]'', the original ''keen'' weapons.
* ''[[Razor's Edge]]'', the personal weapon of the god [[Cyric]]
* The ''[[Moonsword]]'', personal weapon of the goddess [[Eilistraee]]
* ''[[Ever Watchful]]'', personal weapon of the god [[Helm]].
* ''[[Stealthwhisper]]'' and ''[[Shadowblade]]'', the twin swords of the god [[Mask]].
