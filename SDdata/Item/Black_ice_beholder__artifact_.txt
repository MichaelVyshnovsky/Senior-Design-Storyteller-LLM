'''''Black ice beholder''''' was an [[artifact]], a unique ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'' that captured a memory of a [[black ice beholder]] that once plagued [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

This ''figurine of wondrous power'' was a twisted and corrupted artifact, tainted by the evil magic of the ''[[black ice]]''. Instead of conjuring forts a creature, it manifested a memory of a black ice beholder. The image then moved forward, where its summoner was looking, and once it reached an enemy, the beholder exploded violently.

When the ''figurine of wondrous power'' was wielded by someone who also possessed the ''[[cloak of black ice]]'' and the ''[[greater belt of black ice]]'', the set boosted all of its items' offensive power.

==History==
The ''black ice beholder'' appeared for the first time in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, during the ''black ice'' crisis in Icewind Dale.
