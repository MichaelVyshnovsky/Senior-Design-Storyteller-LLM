A '''blanket''' was soft rug used to cover one's body in order to keep warm and comfortable.

==Description==
Blankets were made of comfortable material, such as [[wool]]. Some used their [[cloak]]s as blankets when journeying through cold locations or during winter, or to protect themselves from scorching [[sand]]. Furthermore, they could also be used to cool others down or drive off swarms of flying vermin. 

Blankets were used all over [[Faerûn]],, [[Zakhara]] Specific types of [[saddle blanket|blanket]]s were sometimes placed between the [[saddle]] or the [[barding]] and a mount, in order to make the ride more comfortable, and to protect the mount.

==Powers==
[[Magic]]al blankets were known to exist throughout the [[multiverse]].{{Cite dragon/259/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Sleep on It}}

==History==
When [[Zhengyi]] the Witch-King plagued [[Vaasa]], part of his citadel was occupied by a [[banshee]]. She covered herself in a blanket, and sobbed, drawing adventurers towards her as if she was an upset girl. The banshee aimed to spring unwary adventurers and attack them, should they approach her.

Throughout the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]], one could set up a vending stall by simply placing a blanket on the ground.

==Notable Producers==
* ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold both single and double blankets made of [[flannel]] or wool.
* [[Keshtin Pueblo]], a [[Maztica]]n village, was known for its embroidered blankets.
