The Pavilion of the Enlightened Throne was found within the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The pavilion stood 10 ft. (3 m) off the ground. A lavish golden dome covered the platform.
This platform served as oratory station for important speakers. The Grand Caliph himself used the pavilion during his Ascension Day ceremonies.
The pavilion was enchanted so that a speaker could project their voice to every soul in attendance of the court. A special command word was needed in order to activate this feature. If someone standing on the pavilion did not have the command word then their voice would not be heard at all. The pavilion also held enchantment to protect the speaker from hostile magic.
