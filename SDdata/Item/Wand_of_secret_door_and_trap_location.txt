Wands of secret door and trap location were magic items used to reveal the locations of both hidden doors and traps.
The effective range of these wands was a radius of  around the wielder for revealing secret doors and double that distance for traps. The wand would pulse with energy when pointed at a secret door or trap. It could only be used to detect doors or traps for each charge expended, but the wand could be recharged.
* Filarion Filvendorson, an elf inhabiting Daggerford, carried a wand of secret door and trap location.
