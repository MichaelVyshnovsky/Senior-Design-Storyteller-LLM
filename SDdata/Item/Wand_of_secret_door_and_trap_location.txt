'''''Wands of secret door and trap location''''' were [[magic item]]s used to reveal the locations of both hidden doors and [[trap]]s.

==Powers==
The effective range of these [[wand]]s was a radius of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} around the wielder for revealing secret doors and double that distance for traps. The wand would pulse with energy when pointed at a secret door or trap. It could only be used to detect doors or traps for each charge expended, but the wand could be recharged.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Filarion Filvendorson]], an [[elf]] inhabiting [[Daggerford]], carried a ''wand of secret door and trap location''.
