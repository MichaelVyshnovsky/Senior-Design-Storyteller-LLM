        "mainbody": "'''Tanlarl''' was a kind of aphrodesiac [[perfume]], commonly found in the cities and communities along the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Description": "Tanlarl was a greasy ointment of reddish-brown color that turned clear and stopped feeling oily upon contact with the user's skin. Tanlarl had a very peculiar reaction with different types of skinâ€”generally the ointment smelled pleasantly of wood smoke, but on some bodies it lost all smell completely. When applied to most females, tanlarl exuded a smell of mildew, and when applied to most males, it gained a warm, leathery smell that generally proved very attractive to women.\n\nA perhaps unintended side effect of tanlarl was that it acted as an extremely strong aphrodisiac for [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s who happened to smell it.",
        "Preparation": "It was a popular belief that tanlarl was made from the secretions of rare monsters, but it was actually derived from common vegetable [[oil]]s, [[herb]]s, and [[ox]]en livers."
