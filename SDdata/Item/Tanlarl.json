        "mainbody": "Tanlarl was a kind of aphrodesiac perfume, commonly found in the cities and communities along the Sword Coast.\nTanlarl was a greasy ointment of reddish-brown color that turned clear and stopped feeling oily upon contact with the users skin. Tanlarl had a very peculiar reaction with different types of skinâ€”generally the ointment smelled pleasantly of wood smoke, but on some bodies it lost all smell completely. When applied to most females, tanlarl exuded a smell of mildew, and when applied to most males, it gained a warm, leathery smell that generally proved very attractive to women.\nA perhaps unintended side effect of tanlarl was that it acted as an extremely strong aphrodisiac for orcs and half-orcs who happened to smell it.\nIt was a popular belief that tanlarl was made from the secretions of rare monsters, but it was actually derived from common vegetable oils, herbs, and oxen livers."
