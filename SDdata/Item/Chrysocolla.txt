Chrysocolla was a translucent variety of chalcedony found in the Realms.
These ornamental stones ranged in hue from green to blue-green because of varying amounts of copper in their forming. The most valuable specimens were free from inclusions and exhibited no variation in color. Chrysocolla stones were most often tumbled smooth for use as earrings and pendants but were also seen in a faceted style. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.
Chrysocolla stones were crushed to a powder and used in magical ink to inscribe animate dead spell scrolls. The powder could also be used in the animation ritual, typically by being tossed into a fire or sprinkled over a hot brazier.
Chrysocolla stones or powder could be used to neutralize alcohol by adding them to a drink or including them in the crafting of a drinking vessel. The alcohol had to come in direct contact with some form of chrysocolla to be neutralized.
