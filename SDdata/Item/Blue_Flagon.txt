'''Blue Flagon''' was a type of [[ale]] concoction found in the fishing town of [[Tulmene]] on the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
Blue Flagon was served at [[the Fast Sails]] tavern in Tulmene. It was more expensive than the tavern's swirl â€“ [[Red Wyrm Ale]]. The Flagon was a dark nutty ale with an after taste that cleared up one's throat. Some called it almost [[minty]].
