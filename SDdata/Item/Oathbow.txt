An oathbow was a magical longbow that could be set to become particularly deadly to a sworn opponent of its user.
Every time an arrow was notched on an oathbow, it whispered a phrase in elvish to its attuned user acknowledging its readiness to accept a sworn opponent. If the user responded with the command phrase upon loosing the arrow towards an opponent, that target became the bows sworn enemy for seven days, or until death. The magic of the oathbow rendered it extremely precise when shooting arrows toward its sworn enemy, even if behind cover or at extremely long distances. Arrows that hit the oathbows designated target were also rendered extremely deadly. At the same time, a committed oathbow became considerably ineffective at shooting at any target other than its current sworn enemy.
An oathbow could be reset to a new enemy the dawn after its previous target died. It could only have one designated target at a time.
