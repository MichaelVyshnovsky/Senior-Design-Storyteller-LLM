'''Diamond shields''' were a type of [[shield]] typical of the [[Shoon Imperium]].

==Description==
These shields, whose name came from their typical shape made of four isosceles triangles, were meant to protect the off-hand forearm and upper-arm of a combatant. They were usually reinforced by a {{SIAdj|2|inch|c|long=true|adj=wide}} strip of [[:category:metals|metal]] riveted along their edge.

==Notable Diamond Shields==
*[[Kuraltaar]] and twelve other [[demonshield]]s were magical diamond shields containing bound [[fiend]]s. They were created by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] during the 1{{st}} century [[DR]].
