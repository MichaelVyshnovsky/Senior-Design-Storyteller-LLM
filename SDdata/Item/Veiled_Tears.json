        "History": "The ''Veiled Tears'' was created sometime before [[1372 DR]] by an elven master smith named [[Quilin]]. Subsequently, the powerful enchanted sword gained a negative reputation. With time, a lesser cousin of the ''Veiled Tears'' was created by one of Quilin's apprentices for mistress [[Lissial‎]]. That sword was originally named the ''[[Gentle Rain‎]]''."
