The mirror of perfection was a magic item in Koryo in northeast Kara-Tur.No powers or statistics are given for the mirror, so it is unknown what, if anything, it actually does, nor why it is important.
Around 607 DR, the mirror of perfection was hidden in the Caves of Ghazz on the island of Saishu off the coast of Koryo.This is 750 years before the setting date of 1357 DR.
It was thought to still be there by 1357 DR, but the exact location of the caves was unknown. This was one of the local legends that Dan Zor, the former king and governor of Saishu, wished to investigate. By 1357 DR, he sought adventurers who would seek out the caves for him.
