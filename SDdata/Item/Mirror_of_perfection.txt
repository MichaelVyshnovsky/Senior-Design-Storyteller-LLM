The '''''mirror of perfection''''' was a magic item in [[Koryo]] in [[northeast Kara-Tur|northeast]] [[Kara-Tur]].<ref group="note">No powers or statistics are given for the ''mirror'', so it is unknown what, if anything, it actually does, nor why it is important.

Around [[607 DR]], the ''mirror of perfection'' was hidden in the [[Caves of Ghazz]] on the island of [[Saishu]] off the coast of Koryo.<ref group="note">This is 750 years before the setting date of 1357 DR.

It was thought to still be there by [[1357 DR]], but the exact location of the caves was unknown. This was one of the local legends that [[Dan Zor]], the former king and governor of Saishu, wished to investigate. By 1357 DR, he sought adventurers who would seek out the caves for him.
