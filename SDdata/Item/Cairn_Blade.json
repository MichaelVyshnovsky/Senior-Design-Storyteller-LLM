        "History": "''Cairn Blade'' was the sword of the mercenary leader Adal Kerrn, named in equal parts as a pun on its owner's name and for its ability to lay enemies low. Adal gained his skills as a heavy infantryman and later assembled a group of mercenaries under his wing. Adal Kerrn often sold his services to warlords, bandits, [[wizard]]s, and various churches. ''Cairn Blade'' was in Adal's possession until his death in [[1054 DR]] when he was crushed by a [[horse]] he accidentally slew when fighting a heavily armored opponent. The same battle wiped out the rest of Kerrn's Breakers. Even though Adal Kerrn's body was never recovered, ''Cairn Blade'' was found and appropriated by the [[Church of Helm]].\n\nBy [[1281 DR]], ''Cairn Blade'' ended up in the hands of an [[orog]] commander named [[Krilag]] who occupied [[Dorn's Deep]]. With his death, ''Cairn Blade'' changed hands once again, potentially picked up by the heroes of [[Kuldahar]]."
