Dragontail was a type of ale found in the fishing town of Tulmene on the Dragons Head Peninsula in Tethyr.
Dragontail was a dark and nutty-flavored ale. It had a warm and yeasty taste. The drink was served at The Fast Sails tavern in Tulmene and was considered a little more expensive libation than what they called the Red Wyrm Ale â€“ a concoction of many cheap local beers and ales, the taverns budget offering.
