'''Dragontail''' was a type of [[ale]] found in the fishing town of [[Tulmene]] on the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
Dragontail was a dark and nutty-flavored ale. It had a warm and [[yeast]]y taste. The drink was served at [[The Fast Sails]] tavern in Tulmene and was considered a little more expensive libation than what they called the [[Red Wyrm Ale]] â€“ a concoction of many cheap local beers and ales, the tavern's budget offering.
