        "mainbody": "Hamadryad eggs were stones used as a holy symbol by worshipers of the Treefather.\nHamadryad eggs were white egg-shaped stones bearing a carved symbol representing an oak leaf. The carving would turn green when used by a faithful to focus divine magic.\nSome eggs were known to empower the casting abilities of their users, and granted them limited teleportation abilities.\nThe first egg was carved by a cleric of Silvanus, who offered it as a joke to Metiai, a hamadryad. It was said that on the night of the next full moon, she gave the cleric the stone back imbued with potent enchantments."
