Sapphire pendants of mage armor were enchanted pieces of jewelry worn by the aarakocra elders of Kir Sabal in the late 15 century DR.
These enchanted amulets were inlaid with a single deep-blue sapphire.
Sapphire pendants of mage armor protected the wearer from magical attacks and enhanced the wearers defensive spellcasting abilities. Additionally, the sapphire pendants allowed the wearer to cast the mage armor spell.
