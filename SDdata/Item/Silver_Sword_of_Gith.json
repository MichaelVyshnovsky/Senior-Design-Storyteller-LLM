        "Description": "The ''Silver Sword of Gith'' appeared to have a wavy, jagged-edged silver blade and a golden hilt. It weighed {{SI|4|lb|k|long=yes}}. Although reformed in 1374 DR, several pieces remained missing and these appeared as gaps in the blade, with a ghostly outline to mark where they should be.",
        "History": "According to legend, the ''Silver Sword'' was originally forged by the mystic [[Zerthimon]], who gave it to Gith, leader of the rebellion of [[Gith (race)|their enslaved race]] against the [[illithid]]s. She wielded it much in their battles against the mind flayers. But after their liberation, Gith and Zerthimon came into conflict over the future of their race, which in turn split into the githyanki and the [[githzerai]]. Gith took the ''Silver Sword'' with her.\n\nWhen Gith ventured into the [[Nine Hells]] to seek an alliance with [[Tiamat]] and the [[red dragon]]s and never returned, the ''Silver Sword'' was lost. It would have a number of owners in its long history.\n\nThe god of the dead [[Myrkul]] later retrieved the ''Silver Sword of Gith'' from the Nine Hells and gifted it to [[Akachi]], his high priest and [[Chosen]]. The ''Silver Sword'' was used as the key to [[Betrayer's Gate|a portal]] to the [[Fugue Plane]] located in the [[Death God's Vault]], a [[Myrkulyte]] temple on the [[Plane of Shadow]] in [[Mulsantir]]. But in time, Akachi turned against his god. He led a [[Betrayer's Crusade|crusade]] through the portal and used the blade to try and destroy the [[Wall of the Faithless]] and free his dead love, known as the [[Founder]], a [[Faithless]] whom Myrkul would not spare judgement. But the crusade was defeated and Akachi punished, becoming the spirit eater curse. Apparently returned to the Nine Hells, the fate of the ''Silver Sword of Gith'' is unknown.\n\n[[File:Ammo Jerro and King of Shadows.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''Ammo Jerro swinging the ''Silver Sword'' against the King of Shadows.'']]\nYet the [[warlock]] [[Ammon Jerro]] learned of ''Silver Sword of Gith'' from his dealings with the githyanki, [[devil]]s including [[Levistus]] and [[Mephasm]], and an ancient [[crystal dragon]] named [[Nolalothcaragascint]] and determined the blade to be the only weapon powerful enough to defeat the ancient, corrupted Guardian of [[Illefarn]]. He ultimately found the artifact but when he fought the [[King of Shadows]] with it in battle in [[West Harbor]], it shattered into dozens of shards, one of which buried itself inside the body of a baby who would grow up to be called the [[Kalach-Cha]]—\"shard bearer\" in the [[Gith language]].\n\nThe [[slaad]] lord [[Ygorl]] also desired the artifact to increase his own power. At the time, the sword was in the hands of [[Cireka]], a githyanki general. The two battled over it, pitting their armies against each other until their fight spilled over into [[Toril]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]] trapped them in a magical stone. When adventurers released the two in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, their fight resumed until Cireka was slain by the [[red dragon]] [[Caminus]]. [[Rannek]] of [[Nesmé]] retrieved the blade and used it to help defeat Ygorl. He was concerned, however, that the githyanki would return to retrieve it at some point.<ref group=\"note\">''Demon Stone'' and ''Neverwinter Nights 2'' appear to be in conflict, with the former having Cireka and the sword trapped within a stone and the latter having the sword shattered over a similar period. However, the timeline of both events is unknown and it is possible shards were broken off a still mostly complete sword, or that there are actually two different swords identified as the ''Silver Sword of Gith''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Kalach-Cha collected the scattered shards, whilst being pursued by the zealous githyanki led by [[Zeearie]], and eventually reassembled them at the site where the blade originally shattered, the ruins of West Harbor, with the aid of the githzerai [[Zhjaeve]]. Though it could not be fully restored, the sword gained several new powers, owing to the fractured nature of the blade and a shard still being embedded in the Kalach-Cha's chest, forming a close bond between sword and wielder. The still-powerful blade was then used to finally defeat the King of Shadows.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Because you had the will to ''master'' the Blade of Gith.\n| source = The Founder's reason for choosing the Kalach-Cha.\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nWhen the Kalach-Cha was abducted into the land of [[Rashemen]] by the Founder shortly after vanquishing the King of Shadows, the prime shard that was buried in the Kalach-Cha's chest was torn out violently.

        "Powers": {
            "Partially Reformed": "Following its partial reforming in 1374 DR, the ''Silver Sword'' was a ''+3 [[alchemical silver]] [[longsword]]'',\n\nUniquely, the Kalach-Cha, who served as its master and whose embedded shard provided the binding force holding the blade together, could control the individual shards purely through force of will, and thus break apart and reform the blade elsewhere as desired. In this way, the Kalach-Cha developed a variety of unique powers and tactics, so long as the ''Silver Sword'' was in hand. By simply swinging the sword, a hail of shards could fly at an opponent, piercing and cutting them; this could be done as often as desired. Other powers had more limited usage. In one, a storm of fast-flying shards would sweep through a group of foes or assail a single target, injuring and knocking them over. In another, the shards formed a barrier around the Kalach-Cha, striking all enemies who got close and even slowing, blinding, and deafening them.\n\nTo restore the energy needed for these powers, the Kalach-Cha had to take time after a battle to meditate and reestablish the bond. The Kalach-Cha could always reform and call the ''Silver Sword of Gith'' back, thus ending the storm or barrier powers on command. Even when separated, a basic ''silver sword'' remained in hand.",
            "Fully Reformed": "When fully reformed later in 1374 DR, it became more powerful, being an enchanted ''[[keen]] alchemical silver longsword''. It was more damaging in battle and especially to [[outsider]]s and could inflict injurious cold or emit a [[sound burst|damaging sonic wave]]. It also bestowed immunity to paralyzing magics such as ''[[hold person]]'' and to [[:Category:Mind-affecting spells|mind-affecting magic]]. Wielding it also generally enhanced the Kalach-Cha in mind and body.\n\nUsing a power called 'chilling wrath', the ''Silver Sword'' could fire three beams of freezing energy at a single target, and if all three struck, an icy explosion would occur, knocking down the target and harming all in range. With 'infinite resonance' it could emit a wave of intense sound in all directions, that harmed, deafened, and bowled over those who could not withstand it.\n\nMoreover, all who beheld the blade were influence by its power and 'unity of will'. Allies of the wielder were united in their goals, their [[Heroism|courage greater]] and their [[Mind blank|minds protected]]. Foes who lacked the will to resist were demoralized, being struck with [[fear]] and [[crushing despair]].\n\nThe Kalach-Cha could create an 'unbroken circle' that [[Premonition|lessened the severity of physical damage]] and [[spell mantle|absorbed magical assaults]]. With 'perfect rejuvenation', the Kalach-Cha could also [[Regenerate|heal injuries]] and [[greater restoration|shake off ill-effects]].\n\nFinally, the Kalach-Cha could alter the blade's edge for different advantages in battle for a short time. With a penetrating edge, the blade struck with maximum effect. With a defensive edge, the Kalach-Cha was better protected. And with an anti-magic edge, it [[Mordenkainen's disjunction|cancelled magic]] on the target.\n\nHowever, the energy available was limited, and of the sword's six charges, each of these special abilities consumed two. It could be recharged by casting [[spell]]s on the sword, with this magic being absorbed, but it would also recharge slowly through regular use in battle."
