'''''Coins of Life''''' were [[enchanted]] [[coin]]s dispensed by the [[Church of Waukeen]] in exchange for a large donation, in [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Description==
These [[gold]]en coins bore the likeness of the Marchant's Friend, the goddess of trade and commerceâ€”[[Waukeen]].

==Powers==
''Coins of Life'' were intercessions of two deities, Waukeen and [[Kelemvor]]. Each coin represented Waukeen's purchase of Kelemvor's powers over the dead. Each ''Coin of Life'' possessed the power to bring back a recently deceased creature. To tap into its divine magics, a coin had to be placed under the dead individual's tongue.

==History==
The ''Coins of Life'' first appeared several years following Waukeen's return after being presumed dead for a decade. The Church of Waukeen in Samarach quickly grew in popularity, and eventually, these coins became quite popular by the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
