'''''Potions of icedust''''' were special concoctions designed as protection against fire magic.

==Powers==
When consumed, a ''potion of icedust'' generated a shower of ice shards that surrounded the imbiber in a {{SI|15'|'"|long=yes}} mist of protective cold particles that cooled down and diffused any destructive magical flames, including [[spell]]s like ''[[fireball]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a [[wizard]] slaver allied with [[yuan-ti]] under the command of [[Haegan]] in [[Athkatla]]'s [[Athkatla/River District|River District]] slums carried a vial of ''potion of icedust.'' Another notable user was [[drow]] [[elf]] [[N'ashtar]] of [[Ust Natha]] in the perilous [[Underdark]] who carried a vial the same year.
