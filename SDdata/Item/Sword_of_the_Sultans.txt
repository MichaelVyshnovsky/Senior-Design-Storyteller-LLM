The '''''Sword of the Sultans''''' was an [[enchanted]] blade that once belonged to a ruler of a distant realm, far east from the [[Sword Coast]].

==Powers==
The ''Sword of the Sultans'' was enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment and given a magically sharp [[keen edge]]. The bearer of this [[longsword]] also became more vulnerable to certain conditions and magics that created cold.

==History==
This blade came from somewhere far to the east of the Sword Coast. Much of its history remained unknown, apart from the fact that the sword was procured by [[Lashar‎‎]], a merchant of [[Liam's Hold]], some time in or shortly before [[1372 DR]]. The [[half-orc]] merchant appreciated rare, exotic, and beautiful items of unique designs and far-off lands, but he was glad to part with the ''Sword of the Sultans'' for a price.
