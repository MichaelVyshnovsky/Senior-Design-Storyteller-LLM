'''''Shatter shot''''' was a specific variety of particularly explosive [[mage shot]].

This type of ammunition consisted of a resilient clay pot filled with fluid that exploded upon impact after being hurled by a catapult from the deck of a [[spelljammer]]. The mixture would rapidly expand when exposed to air, typically found within the air envelope of a ship. It was capable of destroying structures such as the hull of a ship or even stone constructs.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}
