        "mainbody": "Speaking daggers were a variety of enchanted daggers that allowed one to send an audible message. \nIn addition to having a +4 enchantment, when a speaking dagger was thrown it emitted an audible message upon impact.\nThis message could be up to 50 words in length, perfectly mimicked the accent and tone of the speaker, could contain any phrase, passcode or instructions and had few limitations to its content. The only phrases that could not be relayed were spell incantations, triggers of any delayed spells, or command words to activate magical items. Only one phrase could be linked to a dagger each day.\nThe message itself was activated and ceased by a code word.\nThese daggers were favored among Calishite torturers, who would throw them to recite mocking phrases at chained prisoners in utter darkness.\nThe crafting of speaking daggers involved crushing certain gems, use of the magic mouth spell, and designation of the unchangeable code word."
