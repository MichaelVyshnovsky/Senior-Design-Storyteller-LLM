        "mainbody": "'''''Speaking daggers''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[dagger]]s that allowed one to send an audible message. {{Cite dragon/169/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A dozen deadly daggers from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}",
        "Powers": "In addition to having a ''+4 enchantment'', when a ''speaking dagger'' was thrown it emitted an audible message upon impact.\n\nThis message could be up to 50 words in length, perfectly mimicked the accent and tone of the speaker, could contain any phrase, passcode or instructions and had few limitations to its content. The only phrases that could not be relayed were [[spell]] incantations, triggers of any delayed spells, or [[command word]]s to activate magical items. Only one phrase could be linked to a dagger each day.\n\nThe message itself was activated and ceased by a code word.",
        "Usage": "These daggers were favored among [[Calishite]] torturers, who would throw them to recite mocking phrases at chained prisoners in utter darkness.",
        "Creation": "The crafting of ''speaking daggers'' involved crushing certain [[gem]]s, use of the ''[[magic mouth]]'' spell, and designation of the unchangeable code word."
