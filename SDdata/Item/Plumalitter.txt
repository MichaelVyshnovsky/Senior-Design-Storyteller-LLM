A '''''plumalitter''''', was a variety of [[litter]]s in [[Maztica]] that had been [[enchanted]] with the [[pluma]] [[spell]] ''[[create talisman]]''.

==Description==
The entire litter was weaved with feathers. The litter was roughly rectangular measuring {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} long by {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} thick. It could safely carry up to {{SI|750|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
The magic enchanting the ''plumalitter'' allowed it hover over the ground once the [[command word]] was spoken. The litter would follow whoever uttered the command word up to a speed matching a normal brisk jog. The ''plumalitter'' could alter its altitude at a rate of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} per minute.
