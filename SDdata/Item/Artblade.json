        "mainbody": "he Artblade (also known as the Noble Sorcerers Sword, or AryFaernKerym in Elven), is one of three Elfblades created in ancient Cormanthyr to help the elves establish a ruling family.  This particular blade is used to name the Spell-Major, the Defender by Art, as he is called. The wielder of the Artblade is responsible for the upkeep of magical defenses of the realm, and command of the AkhFaer, the arcane arm of the military. \nThe Artblade, like others of its type, shares some common characteristics with its kin (see Elfblade), but also has its own special powers, described here.\nThe blade appears as if made of darkness, and its shape is a tangible black void, outlined in a crimson streak which is the source of the blades light. It crackles like lightning when drawn, and creates a sharp buzzing sound when swung, like that of an angry bee.  Oddly, when the blade strikes a foe, there is no sound from the hit, despite the strength behind it. An elven rune near the pommel signifies a thing of magic.\nThe Artblade like all of the elfblades has a bladerite, a test of character given by the blade itself. Passing the bladerite established a magical bond with the sword where the sword recognizes its prospect as its rightful wielder. Failing the Artblade would sever the prospects connection to the Weave leaving them barren of magic for up to two decades. The blade favored arcane casters that had a selfless love for the Art and the people of Cormanthyr.\nThe bearer could sense magic and negate others. In battle the blade could be used as a weapon while still allowing the wielder to cast. The blade channeled the bearers magic acting as their material focus and used the wielders swing and its own buzzing to complete the casting. This also allowed the wielder to wear heavier armors without fear of hindering their casting. The blade also enchanced the wielders evocation magics.\nThrough the bond with the blade the wielder could call the blade to themselves from any location. This made the blade nearly impossible to be lost or stolen. This bond was only broken upon the death of the wielder.\nThe Artblade was created by Elven High Magic alongside its mates, the Warblade and the Rulers Blade in , at the behest of the ill Coronal of Jhyrennstar, Oacenth, who desired the magical swords to determine the rulers of the united tribes and new nation of Cormanthyr.\nFor over four millennia, the sword served the elves well.  However, in 450 DR, the Spell-Major Zaos Durothil lost the blade while battling the Red dragon Edallisufanxar.  For a time, the sword was replaced by Faervian, a Baneblade, created by the human wizard Demron.\nIn 500 DR, the elven noble and bladesinger Josidiah Starym embarked on a famous quest to retrieve the Warblade from the Twisted Tower with a band of his adventuring friends but when he returned in 674 DR he had found the Artblade instead. Josidiah bore the Artblade until his demise in 714 DR during the Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor, when the blade was consumed in a great magical attack by the Starym noble.\nCategoryElfblades\nCategoryMagic blades\nCategoryMagic weapons\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryLongswords\nCategorySlashing weapons\nCategoryMelee weapons\nCategoryOne-handed weapons\nCategoryOne-handed swords\nCategoryItems from Myth Drannor\nCategoryItems from Cormanthor\nCategoryItems from North Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nbwif45zxfby9il33cwuoluhv1somisw"
