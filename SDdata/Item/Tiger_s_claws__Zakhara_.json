        "Description": "Tiger's claws were straps or gloves fitted with spikes,{{Cite dragon/189/Rhino's Armor, Tiger's Claws|37}} This bar was connected along the wearer's palm and back of hand by a metal strip that was attached to another bracelet-type bar that went around the wearerâ€™s wrist.{{Cite dragon/61/Or with a weird one|19}}\n\nThe claws were were situated in such a way that they emerged between a wearer's fingers whenever they made a fist,",
        "Weaponology": "Tiger's claws were typically used for assassinations, rather than in warfare. The most common form of an attack with them was an upward slash.\n\nThough similar in appearance to the [[nekode]] of [[Kara-tur]], tiger's claws could not assist their wearer in acts of climbing.",
        "Notable Tiger's Claws": "* ''[[claws of the shadow]]'': An [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] set of bagh nakh that were used by cultists of [[Kiga]].",
        "Notable Users": "* Since these weapons were small and easily concealed, they were favored by slayers and [[assassin]]s, who often coated the spikes with [[poison]].",
        "Price": "In the land of Zakhara a pair of tiger's claws generally sold for 6 [[silver]] pieces. Outside this region they were considered exotic and thus fetched a much higher price, going as high as 5 [[gold]] pieces."
