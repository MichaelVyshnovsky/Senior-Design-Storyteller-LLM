The most common form of an attack with them was an upward slash.\nThough similar in appearance to the nekode of Kara-tur, tigers claws could not assist their wearer in acts of climbing.\n* claws of the shadow An enchanted set of bagh nakh that were used by cultists of Kiga.\n* Since these weapons were small and easily concealed, they were favored by slayers and assassins, who often coated the spikes with poison.\nIn the land of Zakhara a pair of tigers claws generally sold for 6 silver pieces. Outside this region they were considered exotic and thus fetched a much higher price, going as high as 5 gold pieces."
