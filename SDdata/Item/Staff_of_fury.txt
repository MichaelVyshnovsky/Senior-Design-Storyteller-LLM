A staff of fury was an enchanted staff that augmented a wizards memorized spells.
Holding the staff while casting a spell increased the casting time, but also augmented all other aspects of the spell in question to include the amount of physical harm the spell causedcaused, making the spells effects harder to resist, etc. Using the staff of fury in this manner drained a single charge.
The staff could also be used defensively. The wielder could choose to forgoe any other immediate actions and use the staff to successfully block the next three physical attacks directed at them to include ranged attacks. Another charge was used for each blocked attack. This staff was rechargeable.
