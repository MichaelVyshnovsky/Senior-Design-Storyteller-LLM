        "mainbody": "'''''Air spores''''' were artificially created, [[magic]]al pollen-like spores. Only very few [[mage]]s knew how to create them.",
        "Powers": "When ingested by a creature, ''air spores'' made their way into the lungs where they then grew, reproduced, and eventually died. In environments devoid of oxygen, they would create oxygen for their host to breathe. But in normal, oxygen rich environments, ''air spores'' would hinder a host's respiration. Every twelve hours of breathing in a normal environment, for each day that the ''air spores'' were used, would clear them from a creature's lungs.",
        "Notable Users": "* These were among the magical items commonly used by [[planewalker]]s and could be purchased in the markets of [[Sigil]] at prices lower than those on the [[Prime Material plane]].\n* Powerful [[wizard]]s often had them as specimens of study within their laboratories.\n* Dissolved ''air spores'' were one of the ingredients of the [[steel dragon]] [[Zundaerazylym]]'s magical mixture ''[[longbite]]''.{{Cite dragon/259/Wyrms of the North: Zundaerazylym|72}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors claimed that these spores were created by some [[wizard]] named [[Mordrom]]."
