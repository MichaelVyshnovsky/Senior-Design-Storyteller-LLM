'''Iokharic''' was the name of a script used by the [[Draconic language]], as well as by the [[Auran]], [[Ignan]], and some [[:Category:Human languages|human languages]]. It consisted of runic characters equivalent to letters and numbers in human scripts.

==Alphabet and punctuation==
To give emphasis to important concepts, Iokharic employed a special character consisting of five (or six) lines radiating outwards, similar to a star or an asterisk (*), or the five heads of [[Tiamat]]. When this character was written, the word was spoken with both the first and last syllables stressed.

==History==
[[File:NW Cult of the Dragon graffiti.jpg|thumb|right|''Graffiti of Cult of the Dragon symbol and Iokharic writing.'']]
[[Dragon]]s believed Iokharic was created by the dragon god [[Asgorath]] so his creations could record their impressions of the world he hoped they would inherit.

[[Elven]] scholars had the theory that [[kobold]]s, rather than [[dwarves]], were the ones who actually created Iokharic, as it was widely believed that the earliest kobolds served dragons, learning dragon ways. The oldest historical records of kobold history began with paintings, then pictograms, and gradually developed into the Iokharic script.

''Circa'' [[1479 DR]], someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and a symbol. Locals believed the images were evil and worried of a [[Ashmadai|devil-worshiping]] cult in the area. They were mistakenâ€”it was a [[Cult of the Dragon|dragon-worshiping cult]].
