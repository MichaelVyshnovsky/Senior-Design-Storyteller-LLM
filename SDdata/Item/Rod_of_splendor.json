        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of splendor''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[rod]] capable of turning its wielder into a natural leader.",
        "Powers": "Anyone who carried one of these rods was granted the charisma of a natural leader so long as the rod remained in their possession. The rod also created an [[illusion]] making any garments or equipment worn by the wielder to appear to be of the highest quality. The wielder could activate the rod to actually transform their current clothing into a fine outfit complete with [[gem]]s and [[jewel]]s. The ensemble would be valued at 7,000–10,000 [[gp]]. This new apparel would remain in existence so long as the wielder did not have it forcibly removed from their person or try to sell it. The clothing would simply vanish in either case. However, the wielder could give the clothing as a gift to another person.\n\nA ''rod of splendor'' could also create a luxurious pavilion of silk complete with extravagant furnishings and delicious food. The size of the pavilion was between {{SI|1500|sq ft}}–{{SI|3000|sq ft}}, allowing the entertainment for up to 100 people. The tent would last for one full day before vanishing but could be maintained by expending another of the rod's charges. Any items taken from inside of the tent would disappear when the tent vanished.\n\nThese items could not be recharged.",
