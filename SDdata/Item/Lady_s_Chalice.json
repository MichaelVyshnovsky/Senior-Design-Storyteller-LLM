        "mainbody": "The Ladys Chalice was a magical cup used in the ceremony held in Loudwater every Shieldmeet to select the Chosen of Mielikki known as the Green Regent, as well as the Scions of the Green Regent. It was in the possession of the druids of the Circle of the Stag in the High Forest.\nIt was a simple clay cup, with a painted relief depicting stags prancing with unicorns in a field beneath the sky, while the base and stem resembled a tree trunk rising from the ground.\nThe cup radiated auras of multiple schools of magic when examined, but its exact item enchantment was unknown. It could not be broken by any available means.\nAll who would volunteer for the role, either as Green Regent or as a Scion, assembled at the Risen Moon Market, in front of the High Lords Hall in Loudwater. There, they were asked to imbibe a secret concoction known as the Greendraught from the Ladys Chalice. Those whom Mielikki accepted as Scions were marked with her holy symbol upon their brow. But those whom she declined could not keep the Greendraught down and, nauseated, vomited it back up.\nKept safe by the Circle, the Ladys Chalice and the recipe for the Greendraught were believed to be crucial to the ceremonyâ€”without them, there could never be another Green Regent."
