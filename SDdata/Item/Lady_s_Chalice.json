        "mainbody": "The '''''Lady's Chalice''''' was a magical cup used in the ceremony held in [[Loudwater]] every [[Shieldmeet]] to select the [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]] known as the [[Green Regent]], as well as the [[Scions of the Green Regent]]. It was in the possession of the [[druid]]s of the [[Circle of the Stag]] in the [[High Forest]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"The Howling of a Mighty Storm\" Plot Recap}}",
        "Description": "It was a simple clay cup, with a painted relief depicting stags prancing with unicorns in a field beneath the sky, while the base and stem resembled a tree trunk rising from the ground.",
        "Powers": "The cup radiated auras of multiple [[schools of magic]] when examined, but its exact [[item enchantment]] was unknown. It could not be broken by any available means.\n\nAll who would volunteer for the role, either as Green Regent or as a Scion, assembled at the [[Risen Moon Market]], in front of the [[High Lord's Hall]] in Loudwater. There, they were asked to imbibe a secret concoction known as the [[Greendraught]] from the ''Lady's Chalice''. Those whom Mielikki accepted as Scions were marked with her [[holy symbol]] upon their brow. But those whom she declined could not keep the Greendraught down and, nauseated, vomited it back up.",
        "Significance": "Kept safe by the Circle, the ''Lady's Chalice'' and the recipe for the Greendraught were believed to be crucial to the ceremonyâ€”without them, there could never be another Green Regent."
