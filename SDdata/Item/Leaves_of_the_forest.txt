The '''''leaves of the forest''''' was a set of magical [[armor]] found in [[Thorngap]], a [[druid]]ic circle in [[Cormyr]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

==Description==
The armor was made of a combination of leather, fabric, and living wood and leaves that fitted to the body. It was roughly equivalent to [[scale mail]] in function.

==Powers==
The wood joined with the wearer's skin when worn, actively protecting and holding them together in the face of oncoming threats. It made them functionally immune to deep, crippling wounds as a result.

==History==
The ''leaves of the forest'' were found in Thorngap after [[adventurer]]s investigated the maddened [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] and overcame his subordinate druids [[Thomren]], [[Drien]], [[Larres]], [[Flinbeck]], and [[Garick]].
