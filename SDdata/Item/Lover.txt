The '''''Lover''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[throwing knife]] once wielded by a notorious thief [[Fehll Brownbriars]] before [[1281 DR]].

==Description==
The dagger was decorated with a small heart-shaped [[ruby]].

==Powers==
The ''Lover'' possessed a formidable ''+4'' enchantment and had magics that returned the dagger back into the hands of the one who threw it, similar to the ''[[dagger of returning|daggers of returning]]''.

==History==
The ''Lover's'' first known owner was a [[Waterdhavian]] [[half-elven]] [[thief]] Fehll Brownbriars, notorious for his burglaries and romantic conquests. Fehll's reputation brought a small army of rivals and enemies, all of whom wanted to get their hands on the thief's enchanted knife. Eventually, Fehll Brownbriars was killed by a clever seductress who warmed her way to his heart and ended his life, to the thief's great surprise. The seductress's name was [[Prespera]] of [[Orlumbor]], who claimed the coveted dagger and sold it to the highest bidder. After that, the ''Lover'' disappeared into the roll of years until it reappeared once again in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, among the hoards of treasures inside the temple dedicated to [[Icasaracht]] the [[white dragon]] on the island in [[Lac Dinneshere]].
