        "mainbody": "The guidance of Shar was a powerful magical holy symbol of Shar, found in Cormyr in the 15 century DR.\nThe symbol was a simple thin, flat, black steel disk with a purple border about the edge, forming the common symbol of Shar.\nThe disk had several effects upon its bearer, even without their devotion to Shar. It passively improved the bearers force of personality, granted them a blurring effect that made them harder to target, and could temporarily blind enemies in melee. Shars blessing was double-edged, however, and the bearer of the symbol also found themselves being blinded by Shars darkness at times.\nMagistrate Abella Toth granted the symbol as a reward to trustworthy adventurers, who had captured the infamous Sharran priest Dedryk Black for her."
