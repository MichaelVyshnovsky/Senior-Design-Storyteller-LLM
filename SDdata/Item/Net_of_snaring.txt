A '''''net of snaring''''' was a [[magic item]] that could entangle targets. It was generally only usable underwater.

==Powers==
This net could be targeted at any single creature within {{SIrange|10|120|ft}}, entangling them to the point where it was difficult for them to move and perform any actions. Ensnared targets would be held for ten minutes unless released by the wielder. [[Dragon]]s and creatures of similar size could break free of the net within one minute.

==Creation==
The hair of [[korred]]s could be used to manufacture these nets.

==Notable Owners==
[[Minak al-Zafyi]], a shopkeeper in the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]], owned a ''net of snaring''.
