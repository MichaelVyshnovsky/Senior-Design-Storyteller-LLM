The '''''Inferno Knife''''' was an ancient enchanted [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[dagger]] from [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''Inferno Knife'' was a sturdy small blade made out of burgundy-colored metal.

==Powers==
The ''Inferno Knife'' possessed a ''+3'' enchantment and allowed its wielder to spray arcane flames, similarly to the ''[[burning hands]]'' spell. The dagger held ten charges.

==History==
This enchanted blade was sealed within a chest in the [[Halls of Light]] of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] sometime before the  underground complex was sealed by the fleeing survivors of the [[Weeping War]].

In [[1369 DR]], the chest containing the magic dagger was discovered by a [[halfling]] [[rogue]], merchant, and a scavenger [[Nottle]]. The chest was guarded by three [[wraith]]s, somehow bound to the chest as its defenders. The halfling was captured by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] before retrieving the item. Later, Nottle told of the item's location to the [[Veiled Ones]] as a reward for his freedom.
