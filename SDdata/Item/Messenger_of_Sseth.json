        "Description": "The ''Messenger of Sseth'' was visually distinct. The [[bow]]'s grip was banded with red and black â€“ colors of the [[yuan-ti]] archer [[Apali]]'s pious [[priest]] family. The bow's ends were carved to depict [[snake]] heads, symbolizing the yuan-ti deity [[Sseth]].",
        "Powers": "The longbow was a powerful ''+2'' enchanted weapon that allowed the wielder to launch three [[arrow]]s per six seconds.",
        "History": "This bow was crafted thousands of years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, by a warm-blood hater named Apali. The yuan-ti was a powerful and long-living archer who slew countless men, women, and children with the ''Messenger of Sseth'' over the course of several centuries he lived through. Apali was killed in [[Chessenta]] by a cleric of [[Assuran]] in revenge for the murder of the cleric's great-grandparent in [[Chult]] a century earlier.\n\nThe bow changed hands until it reached the [[Dragon's Eye]] on the [[Spine of the World]]. In 1281 DR, the ''Messenger of Sseth'' was wielded by a yuan-ti High Archer in service of a [[marilith]] [[Yxunomei]]."
