        "mainbody": "'''''Nature's scythes''''' were once dreadful magic weapons of war left behind by the creatures of the [[Army of Darkness]] after the [[Weeping War]].",
        "Description": "''Nature's scythes'' were crudely made weapons that usually looked like they were assembled using a gnarled branch of an  old [[oak]] tree and a terrifying-looking rough finish blade of [[cold iron]].",
        "Powers": "This exotic weapon possessed a ''+1'' enchantment but was especially powerful when wielded against [[human]]s, making it a ''+4'' enchantment.",
        "History": "''Nature's scythes'' dated back to the Weeping War and were left behind in the great forest of [[Cormanthor]] by the creatures under [[Malimshaer]]'s and [[Gaulguth]]'s leadership. The evil scythes were left among the debris of battle alone for centuries as the pure nature's effects on the items leached the evil essence out of the enchanted magic. ''Circa'' [[1372 DR]] ''Nature's scythes'' could be found along the [[Sword Coast]], often in possession of [[Chauntea]]'s devotees with no taint of evil magics remaining on the items."
