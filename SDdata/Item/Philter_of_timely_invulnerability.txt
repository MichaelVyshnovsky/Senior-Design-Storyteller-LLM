A philter of timely invulnerability was a potion that rendered its drinker almost invulnerable.
When imbibed, the drinker was temporarily transformed into an insubstantial, misty form similar to the effects of the wraithform spell. While under the influence of the potion, the affected creatures eyes glowed with a silver light.
When struck, instead of suffering damage, the affected creature was healed.
In addition, the affected creature was protected with effects similar to the neutralize poison spell.
This potion was used by Harpers to escape captivity or to evade a group of enemies.
