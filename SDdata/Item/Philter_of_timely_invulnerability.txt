A '''''philter of timely invulnerability''''' was a [[potion]] that rendered its drinker almost invulnerable.

==Powers==
When imbibed, the drinker was temporarily transformed into an insubstantial, misty form similar to the effects of the ''[[wraithform]]'' spell. While under the influence of the potion, the affected creature's eyes glowed with a silver light.

When struck, instead of suffering damage, the affected creature was healed.

In addition, the affected creature was protected with effects similar to the ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell.

==History==
This potion was used by [[Harper]]s to escape captivity or to evade a group of enemies.
