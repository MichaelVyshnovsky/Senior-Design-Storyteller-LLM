A wind fan was a magic item capable of creating a strong burst of wind.
These items were made of wood, papyrus, and cloth.
When the proper command word was uttered, using the wind fan released an effect similar to a gust of wind. This could be done once per day without risk, but more frequent use of a wind fan risked breaking it. Some models could not be used again until the recharged during the next dawn.
