Alchemists supplies were an array of supplies that were used by a prospective alchemist.
A typical set of alchemists supplies included two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients such as salt, powdered iron, and similar materials.
