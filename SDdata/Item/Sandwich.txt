'''Sandwiches''' were a type of handfood made from a variety of ingredients, such as [[spice]]d [[chicken]] or [[ham spread]], all stacked and affixed on to the rich and powerful.

==Variations==
A [[Waterdhavian]] establishment called [[Mother Teshla's Turret Club for Adventurers]] served hot dripping [[butter]]-and-[[bacon]] sandwiches to its guests.

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] in [[Cormyr]], [[prawn]]-and-[[cress]] sandwiches were all the rage in the king's court. In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, sandwich platters could be found served in taverns and inns, such as [[The Hidden Lady]] of [[Suzail]]. Some of these sandwiches were stacks of folded meat and [[millet]]. In [[Immersea]], [[cheese]] sandwiches were a common snack.

The [[Elfsong Tavern]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] served plain or spiced melted cheese sandwiches among its many foods in its taproom.

[[The Happy Hippocampus]] in the town of [[Hill's Edge]], the [[Sunset Vale]], served a distinct variation of open-faced sandwiches called [[hot bites]].

In the metropolis of [[Ravens Bluff]], the [[Dancing Bear]] tavern served [[gypsy]] dishes made by the [[Stravinsky]] family. [[Gyro]] sandwiches were among the unique delicacies served.{{Cite organized play/LC/Taps!|3}} Another establishment that served sandwiches was a [[gnome|gnomish]] out-of-the-way café named [[Le PoTeete]]. Its gnomish dishes included [[Rosto]], a sandwich of roast [[rothé]] on [[rye bread]], served with gnomish pale [[ale]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Revenge Is Harder than Stone|3}} [[Frieda's Fish Emporium]] of [[Ylraphon]] in [[the Vast]] was an eatery that specialized in fresh and fried fish. One of the items on offer was a fish sandwich.

Sandwiches were made as far south as the [[Border Kingdoms]] and the settlement of [[Gallard]], where fried-fish sandwiches were a common and fragrant occurrence.{{Cite polyhedron/122/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: Gallard|23}}

Platters of cold-meats-and-cheese sandwiches accompanied by [[jug]]s of ale were served in taverns of the planar metropolis of [[Sigil]].

==History==
Sandwiches were eaten as far back and the ancient [[Empire of Netheril]], where meats were smoked to be made into sandwiches.
