Gogondy, also known as gorgondy wine, was a deep gnomish wine made from water drawn from the Fountains of Memory. Those who drank it were oftentimes granted visions.
Gogondy was crimson-colored, supposedly due to it containing powdered ruby. It had a notably intoxicating aroma.
A glass of Gogondy could grant its imbiber the effects of any of a number of divination spells, including vision and contact other plane. The latter effect could either bring the drinker in contact with either the Elemental Plane of Earth or an intermediate deity of the Outer Planes. However, rather than enjoying these benefits, it was noted that humans could fall into a coma or even die from even one glass of the drink.
