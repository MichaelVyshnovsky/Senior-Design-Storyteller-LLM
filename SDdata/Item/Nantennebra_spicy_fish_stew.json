        "mainbody": "Nantennebra spicy fish stew was a well-guarded family recipe served at the Wallside, the only inn in the fishing village of Jhaansciim in Tethyr.\nNantennebra spicy fish stew was one of the two things that made the sleepy village of Jhaansciim notable. The other was a doom-bringing dread ghost â€“ the Crimson Tread. These fish stews were cooked up by Illuse Nantennebra in the late 14 century DR, locally known simply as Mother Nantennebra. Her spicy fish stews were thick, oily, and brown, reminiscent of the dirty swamp waters where things have died long ago. Despite the unassuming and unappealing appearance, Nantennebra stews were exquisite in taste, consumed by every mouth in the village, and brought visitors from afar to try the marvel of rural cuisine. The stews tasted marvelous, be they hot or cold.\nMother Nantennebra happily filled potfuls of her stew to anyone who brought their own receptacle to The Wallside. However, the recipe for the delicacy was a family secret, and she never sold the stew in bigger quantities than a single pot. Despite its popularity and financial potential, Mother Nantennebra refused to move to a bigger and richer town, despite many merchants trying to lure or bribe Illuse and her stew away from Jhaansciim."
