        "mainbody": "he mitbiq () was an interesting Zakharan wind instrument that appeared to be two instruments in one.\nMitbiqs were double clarinets made from reed tubes. Each of the clarinet tubes was complimented by a smaller tube that vibrated to create sound.\nA mitbiq required a great deal of practice to master because it involved inhaling on one clarinet and then exhaling on the other, allowing for continuous tone production."
