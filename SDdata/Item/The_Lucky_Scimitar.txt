'''''The Lucky Scimitar''''' was the unique [[enchanted]] [[scimitar]] from [[Zakhara]].

==Powers==
This aptly named scimitar had a ''+2'' enchantment and improved the luck of its owner in everything they did. This luck included battles, skills, spells, defenses, etc. Additionally, this weapon allowed its user to cast the ''[[luck]]'' spell once per day.

==History==
''The Lucky Scimitar'' originated from the land of Zakhara, where it was in possession of a famous gambler [[Kadan Ibn-Kadur]]. Stories claimed that his enchanted scimitar was what made him renowned for winning countless foolish bets. Eventually, the gambler of magical luck met someone even luckier than he was. [[Nido Ochita Inazuma]], the son of a [[Cormyr]]ean knight and a noble lady from [[Kara-Tur]], was believed to have been born on the edge of the [[Fateful Coin]], after his mother was struck by lightning twice while pregnant. Not being affected by [[Tymora]] nor [[Beshaba]], Nido won the gamble that took the fabled ''Lucky Scimitar'' away from Kadan Ibn-Kadur.

By [[1281 DR]], ''the Lucky Scimitar'' ended up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]].
