Tanarukk bolts were a type of crude, but effective crossbow bolt ammunition created by the tanarri-tainted orcs, Tanarukka.
These crude and heavy bolts possessed fire enchantments. Once fired, Tanarukk bolts started rapidly heating up, causing piercing, and additional searing damage to their targets.
Tanarukk bolts were used by the tanarukka and orc forces of the demon Gorgomorz, circa 1372 DR during the Zhentarim plot against Daggerford.
