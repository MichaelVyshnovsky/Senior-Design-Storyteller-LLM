'''Flails''', also known as '''horseman's flails''' or sometimes '''morningstars''' or '''mace-on-a-sticks''', were a type of one-handed, martial melee weapon.

==Description==
Flails consisted of a haft about {{SI|2|lb|long=yes}} long with a heavy metal ball or rod attached by [[chain]] to the end of the haft. This ball or rod was often spiked.

==Weaponology==
These lighter flails were typically used as one-handed weapons from horseback, but there were also [[heavy flail]]s and [[dire flail]]s for infantry that required two hands. Flails could be used to trip opponents and their flexible chains increased the chance of entangling an enemies weapon, thereby disarming them.

==History==
These military flails evolved from [[threshing flail]]s, a type of farming implement used to thresh grain, replacing its linking [[rope]] with a sturdy chain and [[iron]] weights. 

On [[Toril]] this occurred sometime before {{YearlinkConvert|1265|NY}}, when military flails first became available in the [[Netheril|Netheril Empire]].

==Realmslore==
Flails are often used by priests, although several warriors of note, including the [[genasi]] [[Cephas]] preferred the flail to other weapons.

==Notable flails==

: from [[Baldur's Gate (game)]]
