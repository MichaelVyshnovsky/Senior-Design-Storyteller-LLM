Rings of dwarven bone were enchanted rings carved from the bones of dwarves.
Those that wore one of these rings were imbued with a minor boon to their strength.
These rings were typically worn by the more savage and malicious orcish clans of the North. Orc shamans crafted them from the gathered remains of dwarves and then enchanted them with their foul magic.
