        "mainbody": "Amulets of mental resolve were a type of mind protecting amulet made of cold iron.\nThese amulets enhanced the minds of their wearers, giving them an improved chance to resist charms, illusions, and magical effects that would put one to sleep.\nAmulets of mental resolve came in enchanted variants ranging from +1 to +6.\nAround the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers operating in Tymanther were sent into an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke to recover Melnar, a member of the Gem Assayers Union that had gone missing.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. While exploring a mausoleum in the area that was guarded by a skull enchanted with Skull Watch, the adventurers came across a stone sarcophagus belonging to a Lathanderite named Jagress Dawnlion. Hidden beneath a false bottom in the sarcophagus the adventurers found a number of gold pieces, a +1 amulet of mental resolution, and a +1 symbol of turning."
