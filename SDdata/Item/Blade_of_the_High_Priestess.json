        "mainbody": "The blade of the High Priestess was the sacrificial dagger of High Priestess Hekta Szind of Sschindylryn in the late 15 century DR.\nThe blade had a curved point and many barbs angled backwards, ensuring that it would tear apart the victim when pulled from a wound.\nThe dagger bore a number of enchantments that improved its ability to inflict gruesome wounds, as well as being able to drain the willpower from and paralyze the victim when struck. It also helped channel magical power for the user.\nThe High Priestess Hekta carried the blade during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the Darkening, when she conspired to steal the Thread of the Weave and gift it to Lolth. She used the blade to perform countless dark and bloody rituals while she had it, and was eventually defeated at the Temple of Lolth atop the Sschindylryn Ziggurat."
