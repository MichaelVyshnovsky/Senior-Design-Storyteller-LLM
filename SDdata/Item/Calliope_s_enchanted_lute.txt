Calliopes enchanted lute was a magic instrument owned by an adventuring bard in the late 15 century DR.
This enchanted lute looked like it was through hells. The wood of the lutes body was worn down and spotted cracks. One of the larger ones was mended and splinters tied back to the instrument with a red thong. Another sign of repair could be seen on the lutes neck that was snapped off and mended in the past.

*Calliope a bard adventurer who worked with other warriors of Waterdeep, performing missions on behalf of Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR.
