        "Description": "Tabasheer was found in irregular nuggets that were usually tumbled smooth and then polished to velvety sheen. They were worn in rings and decorated the fringes of shawls and pectorals, mainly in the [[South Faerûn|South]] where this gemstone was used as currency in trade deals, especially when bartering with northern barbarian tribes. A typical specimen has a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "Ground to a powder and placed on the tongue or in an open wound, tabasheer had a remarkable effect on the subject when ''[[cure light wounds]]'' was cast upon it: the recipient of this treatment gained a temporary health boost that lasted for 24 hours or until the health was lost due to subsequent injury, poison, or illness.",
