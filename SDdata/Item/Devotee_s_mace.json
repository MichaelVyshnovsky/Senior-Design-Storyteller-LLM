        "mainbody": "A '''''Devotee's Mace''''' was a powerful and exceedingly rare bludgeoning [[weapon]] used by [[celestial]]s and mortals alike.",
        "Description": "''Devotee's maces'' seemed to be made of some metallic substance similar to [[gold]] in color. They also glowed with a yellow-orange light.",
        "Powers": "In addition to being powerful bludgeoning tools, these ''+3 [[mace]]s'' were able to burn targets with [[radiant energy]] on successful hits. Wielders of these weapons were able to quickly summon an [[aura]] of [[Healing domain|healing]] [[incense]] around themselves, which healed them and nearby allies in a 30-foot (9 meters) radius for around a minute. A seemingly magical glow surrounded these weapons.",
        "History": "The process of creating a ''devotee's mace'' is mostly unknown. ''Circa'' the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], some [[Deity|deities]] were known to answer calls for help from their more powerful [[cleric]]s by offering them these weapons as an act of divine intervention. The weapon that appeared in a cleric's hand as the result of such an intervention was said to be forged in the fires of the holy bond between the worshiper and their deity. While healing and radiant energy were associated mostly with good deities, these weapons could be rewarded by gods of [[evil]] alignments. ''Devotee's maces'' were favored by [[deva]]s."
