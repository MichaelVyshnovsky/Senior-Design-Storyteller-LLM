'''''Effigies''''', or '''''poppets''''' were small innocent-looking dolls crafted in a creature's likeness and used in dark magic rituals.

==Description==
''Effigies'' varied greatly in their appearance, materials, and functionality, depending on the items used in their creation and skills of the crafter. Some of them were created using rags similarly to how rag dolls were sewn.

==Powers==
In order to gain power over another creature via dark magics, an ''effigy'' needed to represent its target, bearing some likeness. A personal item needed to be a part of the poppet. For example, a strand of hair could serve this purpose.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], a [[lizardfolk]] [[shaman]] [[Uzzak-Szalzik]] stole a strand of greasy hair from the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] and created an ''effigy'' of the old witch. The shaman used the ''effigy'' to torture his old enemy, ''cursing'' her with rash from bites of hundreds of [[fire ant]]s. The [[green hag]] was worried the lizardman was going to end her life at any moment and sent an adventurer to steal the poppet. Later, she crafted her own ''effigy'' in likeness of Uzzak-Szalzik and bestowed an infestation of [[dragon lice]] iron him.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an ''effigy'' depicting [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was stashed in the [[Willowwood]] of [[Undermountain]], wrapped in an aura of ''[[conjuration]]'' magic.
