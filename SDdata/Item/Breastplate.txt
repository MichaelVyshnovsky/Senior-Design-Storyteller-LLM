A '''breastplate''' was one of the better forms of medium [[armor]].  

==Description==
The armor covered the wearer's front and back with a metal [[wikipedia:Cuirass|cuirass]], and included a [[helmet]] and [[greave]]s. A light suit of [[studded leather]] beneath the breastplate finished the armor suit, protecting the wearer's limbs without restricting movement much.

==Notable Wearers of Breastplates==
===Individuals===
* [[Aviss]]{{Cite comic/Summer in the City}} and the [[drow]] [[magic-user]] [[Kilili]] both typically wore a golden-hued breastplate.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|7-8}}

===Religions===
* Worshipers of [[Bane]] typically wore black breastplates with a red fist painted on and below the shoulder blades.
