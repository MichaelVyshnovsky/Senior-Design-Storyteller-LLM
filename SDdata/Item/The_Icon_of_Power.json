        "mainbody": "'''''The Icon of Power''''' was a traditional [[enchanted]] [[Loviatan]] [[halberd]] from the temple called the [[Black Spires of the Maiden]].",
        "Powers": "''The Icon of Power'' bore a powerful and deadly ''+3'' enchantment and allowed the wielder to brand their opponents with the ''[[symbol of pain]]'' three times per day, magically reducing their agility and defense, making them a much easier target for the heavy halberd.",
        "History": "The temple of the Black Spires of the Maiden stood in the [[Vale of Wailing Women]] and was mostly ignored by the churches of good deities who considered [[Loviatar]] an enemy. Nevertheless, the Black Spires had a significant garrison, led by the [[Whip of Obedience]], traditionally armed with ''the Icon of Power''. The blade's name and reputation inspired the temple's troops to strive for perfection and do better in their duties.\n\nSometime before [[1281 DR]], an unnamed [[thief]] from [[Elturel]] made stealing ''the Icon'' a personal challenge. The heist was successful and the halberd was sold to the [[Church of Bane]]. The weapon remained within the Banite temple in [[Anauroch]], called the [[Obsidian Chapel]], out of contempt for the Whip of Obedience's failure to protect ''the Icon of Power''. Eventually, the Obsidian Chapel was plundered and razed during a [[Bedine]] raid.\n\nSome time later, by [[1281 DR]], ''the Icon of Power'' ended up stored within the frozen [[Icasaracht's Temple]] on [[Lac Dinneshere]] in [[Icewind Dale]]."
