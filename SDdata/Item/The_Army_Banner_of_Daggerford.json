        "mainbody": "he Army Banner of Daggerford was the famous banner, wielded by the forces of the Duke Daggerford during the Second Dragonspear War of 1363 DR.\nThe Army Banner of Daggerford was a simple banner that showed the signs of age and battles. It bore white and blue colors of the city of Daggerford and the symbol of a sword on a background of blue and white waves.\nDuring one of the battles of 1363 DR, the Second Dragonspear War, the Army Banner of Daggerford militia was lost as the forces of the Duke were forced to retreat back to Daggerford. The orcs and devils dragged the banner back into Dragonspear Castle, reveling in a battles victory. The Army Banner was erected on top of the tallest spire of Dragonspear as a proud war trophy. With the enemy stronghold being perceived as impregnable, the Daggerford militias morale plummeted. The Duke knew that demoralization was sure to result in a crushing defeat, and recovering the banner was essential to survival. However impossible the task seemed, one soldier stepped forward as a volunteer. Her name was Kaylet Wespil. She was known for her recklessness nor heroics. However, her father was a renowned hero for his bravery and risk-taking during the sellsword days. Kaylet was not a reckless woman. She had a plan of how to get to the banner and return it to the militia.\nWith Dukes permission, the woman rode to her cottage a few miles away from Daggerford and retrieved a small lockbox left to her by her heroic parent. A small enchanted whistle was inside the box. As she blew into it, a giant shadow fell on the cottage. Several hours later, Kaylet Wespil returned to the Dukes tent, carrying the Army Banner of Daggerford. The ruler was speechless at the feat, and when he asked how she accomplished such a task, Kaylet pointed to the tents entrance. There, in front of shocked militiamen, stood a powerful bronze dragon. Kaylet called in a favor from her fathers old ally and flew him into Castle Dragonspear, snatching the banner before any of the orcs could notice. The Duke commissioned the dragons help with the ensuing battle. The militia morale was high once again, and Daggerford, along with its allies, won the Second Dragonspear War soon after.\nEventually, the famous banned ended up in the hands of Torleth Mindulspeer of Gillians Hill, where it was proudly displayed within Torleths Treasures circa 1372 DR."
