A kaleidoscope was a type of optical instrument and toy in the Realms.
Kaleidoscopes resembled a spyglass and were typically made from brass. But rather than clear glass, their tubes sported an array of colored glass and gems that were mirrored back at the observer, creating a vivid multicolor display.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold kaleidoscopes that were imported from Calimshan. Advertising it as a toy great for all ages, the catalogue offered them at a price of 50 gold pieces.
* Black blood kaleidoscope, an artifact created by the binder Zceryll.So little is known about this artifact that it isnt even guaranteed that it is a literal kaleidoscope.
* Uxmas kaleidoscope, a Maztican kaleidoscope that was enchanted with pluma magic.
The existence of kaleidoscopes on Toril dated as far back as the Netherese Empire. During that time they were occasionally used by mages—in place of telescopes, glass eggs, or the far more common option of mirrors—as a medium through which to peer into other worlds or planes of existence.
