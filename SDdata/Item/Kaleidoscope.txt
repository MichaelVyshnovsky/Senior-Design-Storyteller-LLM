A '''kaleidoscope''' was a type of optical instrument and toy in the Realms.

==Description==
Kaleidoscopes resembled a [[spyglass]] and were typically made from [[brass]]. But rather than clear [[glass]], their tubes sported an array of colored glass and [[gem]]s that were mirrored back at the observer, creating a vivid multicolor display.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold kaleidoscopes that were imported from [[Calimshan]]. Advertising it as a toy great for all ages, the catalogue offered them at a price of 50 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Kaleidoscopes==
* ''Black blood kaleidoscope'', an [[artifact]] created by the [[binder]] [[Zceryll]].<ref>{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Binders}}<ref group="note" name="name">So little is known about this artifact that it isn't even guaranteed that it is a literal kaleidoscope.
* ''[[Uxma's kaleidoscope]]'', a [[Maztica]]n kaleidoscope that was [[enchanted]] with [[pluma]] magic.

==History==
The existence of kaleidoscopes on [[Toril]] dated as far back as the [[Netherese Empire]]. During that time they were occasionally used by [[mage]]s—in place of [[telescope]]s, glass eggs, or the far more common option of [[mirror]]s—as a medium through which to peer into other worlds or [[planes of existence]].<ref>
