The great crossbow was a unique variety of siege engine developed by the gnome inventor Nadul DaRoni in the late 14 century DR.
As its name implied, the great crossbow looked like a crossbow but massively scaled up, with three wheels mounted along each side of its base. Moving and aiming the weapon required a team of four demihumans and horses, while loading it required a team of eight demihumans and four horses.
The great crossbow was designed particularly with trees in mind, having them emulate the quarrels used in crossbows, though earth or stone could also be used as ammunition. The largest size of straight trunk the weapon could hold was  and  wide. DaRoni recommended pine trees stripped of their branches as the most ideal option and suggested that covering the weapon in dry pine needles made for a much slicker launch.
In tests conducted by DaRoni, it was observed that the great crossbow was capable of smashing solid towers and razing walls that were  thick.
The great crossbow was originally made for King Azoun Obarskyr IV of Cormyr, but never saw use during his reign. The catalogue listed the great crossbow for a price of 1250 gold pieces, though Aurora noted that all of the listed prices for DaRonis inventions were only rough estimates of what he would actually charge.
