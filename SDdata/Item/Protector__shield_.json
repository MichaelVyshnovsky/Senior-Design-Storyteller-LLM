        "mainbody": "Protectors were small enchanted military hin shields from Luiren.\nThese shields were proudly decorated with the markings of Luiren, indicating their military purpose.\nProtectors were functionally buckler for anyone bigger than a halfling. They possessed a +2 enchantment and had an ability to soak part of the damage dealt to it.\nProtectors originated from the strongheart halflings of Luiren. These shields were standard equipment of Luirens well-organized militia and blessed by the leaders of said militia, halfling clergy.\nGenerally, these shields never left Luiren unless taken off a fallen soldiers body. Most protectors that could be found along the Sword Coast in the late 14 century DR were likely looted or stolen from the hardy strongheart halfling."
