        "mainbody": "'''''Protectors''''' were small enchanted military [[hin]] [[shield]]s from [[Luiren]].",
        "Description": "These shields were proudly decorated with the markings of Luiren, indicating their military purpose.",
        "Powers": "''Protectors'' were functionally [[buckler]] for anyone bigger than a halfling. They possessed a ''+2'' enchantment and had an ability to soak part of the damage dealt to it.",
        "History": "''Protectors'' originated from the [[strongheart halfling]]s of Luiren. These shields were standard equipment of Luiren's well-organized militia and blessed by the leaders of said militia, halfling clergy.\n\nGenerally, these shields never left Luiren unless taken off a fallen soldier's body. Most ''protectors'' that could be found along the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] were likely looted or stolen from the hardy strongheart halfling."
