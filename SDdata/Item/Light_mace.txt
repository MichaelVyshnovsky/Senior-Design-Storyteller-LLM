A '''light mace''' was a simple melee bludgeoning weapon and a smaller form of the [[heavy mace]].

==Description==
A light mace was little more than a [[club]] with flanges, knobs, or ridges of metal placed symmetrically around the head. It was made completely out of metal, making it a heavy but difficult to break weapon. A typical light mace weighed {{SI|4|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Cost==
An average light mace cost 5 [[gp]].

==Use==
This weapon was intended to be used one-handed and was simple enough for most combatants to use without any training.

==Realmslore==
The light mace was the [[favored weapon]] of the deities [[Amaunator]] and [[Lathander]], who also treated the [[heavy mace]] the same.
