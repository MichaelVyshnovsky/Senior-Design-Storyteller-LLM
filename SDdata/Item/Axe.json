The haft was usually made of wood to reduce the overall weight. The term \"axe\" is used here as an archetype of hand-held slashing weapons that fit this description and where the [[Blade]] length is considerably less then the overall weapon length.\n\nAxes were the favored weapons of many [[fighter]]s and [[barbarian]]s (especially [[dwarves]]).",
