==Powers==
This item appeared to have the properties of both ''[[oil of slipperiness]]'' and a ''[[potion of delusion]]'' if examined with magic. What a dose of ''universal solvent'' would actually do was to dissolve any adhesive or sticky material that it was applied to. This included cement and magical substances such as ''[[sovereign glue]]'', as well as the goo from a [[tanglefoot bag]] and the adhesive made by [[kuo-toa]].

A single ounce of ''universal solvent'' would work on {{SI|1|cu ft||long=yes}} of adhesive material. A typical container held {{SI|27|fl oz|l}} of fluid. If distilled to one-third of its normal potency, one ounce would cause {{SI|1|cu ft||long=yes}} of organic and inorganic material to ''[[disintegrate]]''.

==Creation==
Creating it required skill at crafting [[magical item]]s and the [[spell]] ''[[disintegrate]]''.

==Notable Owners==
===Individuals===
* [[Torm (adventurer)|Torm]], a member of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] who was a notorious hoarder of magic devices and trinkets, owned some ''ultimate solution'' and sometimes kept it on his person.
===Religions===
* [[Goldeye]]s, [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Waukeen]], had a chance of receiving a [[vial]] of ''universal solvent'' as one of the miscellaneous gifts they received upon admission to the clergy.
