'''Powder of coagulation''' was a type of [[magic]]al, yellow powder that helped to heal wounds.

==Description==
This powder typically came in either packets or pouches that contained around four to sixteen pinches.

==Powers==
When an open wound was applied ''powder of coagulation'' all bleeding ceased and the recipient's body healed to a small degree. If one used a whole packet or pouch, they could apply the powder to all creatures in an area by means of a [[blowpipe]].

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], three pinches of the ''powder of coagulation'' were one of the many rewards that [[Calvin Longbottle]] gave to a group of adventurers after they had brought back artifacts from the legendary ship ''[[Strongwind]]''.{{Cite polyhedron/130/Strongwind|35}}

Following the [[Time of Troubles]], this powder was one of many [[magical item]]s that a newly admitted [[goldeye]] could obtain, curtesy of the [[Church of Waukeen]].

==Notable Users==
===Individuals===
* [[Pizentios]], a gruesome [[necromancer]] from the isle of [[Sahu]] in [[Zakhara]], carried several pouches of ''powder of coagulation''.
===Regions & Settlements===
* Among the [[warrior]]s of the [[drow]] city of [[Sshamath]], this powder was commonly carried while out on patrol.<ref>
