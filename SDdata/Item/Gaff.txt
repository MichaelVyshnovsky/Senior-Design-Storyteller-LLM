'''Gaffs''', otherwise known as '''hooks''', were a type of tool used by both fishermen and sailors.

==Description==
The gaffs typically used by fishermen consisted of a metal hook with a crossbar at the base, made of either metal or wood. When wielded, the hook would protrude between a user's middle and ring fingers. Those utilized by sailors were often attached to a pole that was {{SIrange|10|20|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Weaponology==
Fishermen used the one-handed form of gaff to hook and land fish. The pole-attached version was primarily used by sailors to pull their craft to a dock or another ship. They were also used to rescue cargo or men that fell overboard.

Besides these intended uses, gaffs were occasionally improvised as a sort of piercing weapon that was difficult to disarm. And for sailors who lost their hands, gaffs were often attached to a wooden cup for use as a [[prosthetic]] replacement.

==Availability==
These tools were typically available for purchase wherever fishing was conducted.
