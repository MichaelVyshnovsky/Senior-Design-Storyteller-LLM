        "mainbody": "Starwheels, also known as wheel locks or wheel-locks, that originated somewhere beyond Toril.\nUnlike arquebuses, which had a match-lock mechanism,\nStarwheels typically weighed around .\nWhen its trigger was pressed, the pistols wheel would spin and shower sparks into the enclosed pan where the smokepowder was held.\nThis weapon required only a single hand to operate and inflicted rather little damage, but compensated with an improved ability to aim accurately.\n* These weapons were typically rather rare on Toril.\n* Starwheels were sometimes sold or traded across Toril by spelljammer crews, such as the Smiths Coster trading company, or stolen from those crews by thieves. \n* One particular establishment on Toril where one could purchase starwheels was The Brigadiers Broadside in Skullport.\nOn Toril in the midâ€“14 century DR, a starwheel typically cost around 1,000 gold pieces.\nIn many areas of Wildspace, these pistols would cost around 700 gold pieces, but on the Rock of Bral they sold for only 400 gold pieces.\n* Gnome artificers often wielded starwheels.\n* Advisors of the Elven Imperial Fleet often wielded starwheels.\n* Lancilon Seenabuck\n* Captain Morgan, a dreaded pirate that sailed the Dragon Reach in the 14 century DR, owned a wheel lock.\n* Wealthy scro often owned and fought with starwheels.\nMany in Wildspace considered starwheels to be erratic and untrustworthy, on par with muskets.\nA starwheel over a shield was the symbol of the Smiths Coster trading company."
