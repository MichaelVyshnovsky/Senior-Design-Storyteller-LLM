        "mainbody": "'''''Ghost gauntlets''''' were a variety of [[enchanted]] [[gauntlet]]s that allowed one to both harm [[ghost]]s and be partially incorporeal like them.",
        "Description": "These gauntlets were made of a pale, grey metal that seemed almost transparent at times.",
        "Powers": "Upon a ''ghost gauntlet'' being equipped it would fade into a near complete transparency, leaving behind tattoo-like runes along the wearer's fingers, and activates all its effects.\n\nThe effects of a ''ghost gauntlet'' included temporarily imbuing the ''[[ghost touch]]'' [[weapon quality|quality]] onto any weapon wielded with them. The ability to make parts of the gauntlet, along with the corresponding parts of the hand inside, incorporeal. And the ability to once per day touch and then transport an object to a distant location on the [[Ethereal plane]], much like the ''[[teleport object]]'' [[spell]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]] owned a ''ghost gauntlet'' around [[1374 DR]].<ref>"
