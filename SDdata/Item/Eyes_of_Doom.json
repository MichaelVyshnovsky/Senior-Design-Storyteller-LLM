        "mainbody": "'''''Eyes of Doom''''' were [[enchanted]] [[helmet]]s used by [[Bane]]-worshiping [[Zhentarim]] agents in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The name of the ''Eyes of Doom'' was in reference to two [[lenses]] that were part of the item's design and were mounted over the wearer's eyes. Those to observed a person wearing ''Eyes of Doom'' saw two swirling infinite voids through the helmet's opening. A prominent ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Bane was inscribed upon these items.",
        "Powers": "The wearer was able to cast the ''[[doom]]'' spell once per day by simply meeting their target's gaze with the helmet's void eyes.",
        "History": "Before Bane's demise during the [[Time of Troubles]], ''Eyes of Doom'' were worn by Bane-worshiping Zhents. After the Zhentarim adopted first [[Cyric]] and the Bane's son [[Iyachtu Xvim]], the helmets quickly lost favor and were sold, entering the general population. With Bane's return in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Zhentarim embarked on a mission to reclaim ''Eyes of Doom''.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} center DR, ''Eyes of Doom'' were spread as far as the [[Nelanther Isles]] off the [[Sword Coast]]."
