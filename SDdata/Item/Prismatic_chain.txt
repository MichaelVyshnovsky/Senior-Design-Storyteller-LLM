'''''Prismatic chain''''' was a type of [[enchanted]] [[iron]] [[chainmail]] from the city of [[Westgate]].

==Powers==
The ''prismatic chain'' was imbued with the power of the ''[[color spray]]'' spell. The [[enchantment]] became apparent as the armor absorbed enough magic from the ''[[Weave]]'', and it changed color from that of regular chainmail to a multi-colored hue. The wearer could release pent-up magic once a day from the armor in the form of the ''color spray'' spell. Once it was done, the chainmail returned to its drab color. It took a day for the ''prismatic chain'' to regain its magics and colors. Additionally, the armor possessed a ''+2'' defensive enchantment.

==History==
It was unknown who imbued the ''prismatic chain'' with its colorful magic. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''prismatic chain'' was sold in [[Westgate]], among countless unique and rare weapons and armor on the city's [[Market Triangle]].
