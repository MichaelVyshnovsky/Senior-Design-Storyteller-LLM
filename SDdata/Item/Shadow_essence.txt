'''Shadow essence''' was a [[poison]].

==Effect==
Inflicted via wounding, shadow essence greatly sapped the strength of a victim, and left them permanently slightly weakened.

==Usage==
[[Dark stalker]]s favored shadow essence poison for their ''[[short sword]]s'' and ''[[javelin]]s''.

The poison was often known to be applied to ''[[blowpipe]]'' darts.
