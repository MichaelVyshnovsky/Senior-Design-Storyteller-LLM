The '''''monocle of Bagthalos''''' was a holy [[artifact]] of [[Helm]]. Worn over one eye, it gave its user magically enhanced eyesight. The ''monocle'' was crafted by [[Bagthalos Deszhummer]], Archpriest of Helm, in the 1100s [[DR]], and was imbued with his spirit, which could also curse any who wore the ''monocle''.

==Description==
The ''monocle'' consisted of a clear, circular lens of crystal surrounded by an [[adamantine]] frame that was studded with six loops. Fastened in these loops were six colorful ribbons, allowing the wearer to securely hold the ''monocle'' over their eye, even in the face of physical turmoil.

==Powers==
The ''monocle'' gave its user constant ''[[true seeing]]'', and caused immunity to gaze attacks and any form of hypnotism, whether [[magic]]al or [[psionic]] in nature.

Three times per day, the monocle-wearer could cast ''[[searing light]]''. Furthermore, the ''monocle'' allowed its wearer to ''[[analyze dweomer]]'' at will.

Bagthalos's spirit, trapped within the relic, whispered regrets, guilt, and sorrow into the wearer's mind. A careless user could find themselves magically compelled by the ''monocle'' to rectify a past wrong. This compulsion was similar to a ''[[geas]]'' or ''[[quest]]'' spell, could not be dispelled, and would cause the relic to not function until fulfilled.

==History==
Bagthalos Deszhummer was an Archpriest of Helm in [[Zazesspur]] in the 1100s DR. His order's temple, the [[House of the Steadfast]], was beset by constant thefts from the [[Skeletal Finger]] thieves guild, and Bagthalos suspected magical invisibility was employed to slip past the temple guardians. To combat this, Bagthalos began fashioning a magical detection device for his guards. When Helm learned of Bagthalos's ambition, he gave his Archpriest a stern warning. Helm did not approve, feeling magical aid should not be used in place of vigilance. He warned Bagthalos that continuing his vain research would lead to the death of a being dedicated to Helm. However, Helm did not tell his Archpriest to cease his efforts.

Over the years, Bagthalos continued crafting his device, but found himself agonizing over Helm's warning. The Archpriest had no desire to prosper at the cost of another, and this guilt gnawed at him whenever he made progress. He eventually fell into obsession, his temple duties shirked, and his body wasting away. On his deathbed Bagthalos uttered the final prayers needed to finish his device. However, this also trapped his spirit within the ''monocle'', unknown to all.

[[1142 DR|The next year]], the temple was robbed again by the Skeletal Finger guild, and the ''monocle'' was carried off amidst other loot. For many years, the ''monocle of Bagthalos'' circulated in the black markets of [[Athkatla]] and [[Darromar|Ithmong]], where shady merchants, acting on behalf of the original thieves, offered it for the price of 45,000 gp, far below the item's true value. No buyers were interested, however, and the ''monocle'' languished in the Skeletal Finger's headquarters in the [[Small Teeth]]. Eventually, the mountain stronghold was attacked by the [[blue dragon]] [[Iryklathagra]], who drove the thieves away. The blue dragon settled in the stronghold, and the ''monocle of Bagthalos'' became part of her hoard.

==Reputation==
Since the creator of the ''monocle'' perished immediately after crafting the artifact, it was virtually unknown. Bagthalos took the secrets of its creation with him to his grave.
