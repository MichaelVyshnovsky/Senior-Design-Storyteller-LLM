Brick was a gnomish highsunfeat dish from the city of Ravens Bluff in the Vast.
Brick was an aptly-named wheat bread loaf, stuffed with mushrooms and cheddar, often served with gnomish pale ales, such as Rockgrit, Stint, or Greentart. The loaf was baked until it formed a crunchy shell and served with a portion of white sauce.
Brick was a staple of a gnomish out-of-the way café in Ravens Bluff called Le PoTeete Café in the late 14 century DR. The only other highsunfeat alternative on the menu was Rosto, a type of a sandwich.
