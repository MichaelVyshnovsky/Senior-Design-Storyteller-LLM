        "mainbody": "A '''''knave's eye patch''''' was a [[magic]] [[eye patch]] that granted its wearer a number of benefits. It was particularly effective when worn by [[drow]] and other creatures that were sensitive to [[sunlight]].",
        "Powers": "While attuned to the ''knave's eye patch'', the wearer gained a magically enhanced eyesight, becoming able to discern more minute details within their field of view. It also shielded the wearer's mind, effectively blocking any magic that could read thoughts and even blocking unwanted [[telepathy|telepathic]] communication.\n\nThe ''eye patch'' also made it easier for creatures that were overly sensitive to sunlight―such as drow, [[drider]]s, [[duergar]], [[kobold]]s, [[kuo-toa]], and [[troglodyte]]s―to withstand it. Such creatures suffered no ill effects from exposure to sunlight while wearing a ''knave's eye patch''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* The drow mercenary [[Jarlaxle Baenre]] wore a ''knave's eye patch'' as part of his extensive magic item collection."
