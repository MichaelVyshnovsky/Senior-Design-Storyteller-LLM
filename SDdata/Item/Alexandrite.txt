'''Alexandrite''' was once considered a [[Fancy stones|fancy stone]], but by the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], it had surged in price to that of a [[Precious stones|precious stone]], and maintained its value through the [[Spellplague]] and beyond.

In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], one of these stones had a base value of 100 [[gp]], but since that time a typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp.
