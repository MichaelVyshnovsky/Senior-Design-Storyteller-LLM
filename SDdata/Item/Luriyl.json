        "mainbody": "Luriyl, also known as apatite, was a semi-precious stone widespread and popular in the Realms.\nFound in crystals, luriyl often yielded attractive faceted gems of vivid yellow, green, yellow-green, and (rarely) blue and purple. It was a soft stone and easily worked without specialized tools or extensive knowledge and experience, so it was widely used throughout the Realms for ornamentation. Large specimens of blue or purple were in great demand and mostly included in necklaces, pendants, belts, and insets in gowns or cloaks. A typical yellow or green specimen had a base value of 50 gp, blue and purple stones were priced up to six times higher than the other colors.\nLuriyl gems were sensitive to scrying and would give off a soft glow and a gentle vibration when subjected to magical probes such as clairaudience/clairvoyance."
