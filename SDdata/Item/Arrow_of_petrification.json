        "Powers": "Upon impact, ''arrows of petrification'' acted as a powerful version of the ''[[flesh to stone]]'' spell, [[Petrification|petrifying]] creatures vulnerable to such magics.",
        "History": "These enchanted arrows were famously wielded by Bliney Granter, a renowned basilisk hunter. He shot the missiles at his prey to either slow them down or petrify them, then finishing them up close with the ''[[Shattermaster]]'', his enchanted [[hammer]]. Bliney Granter's career ended ironically, when he accidentally pricked his finger on an ''arrow of petrification''. His petrified remains were later proudly displayed in the Granter widow's manor courtyard."
