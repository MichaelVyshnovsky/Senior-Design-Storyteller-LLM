        "mainbody": "Arrows of petrification were enchanted arrows that could turn their targets to stone.\nUpon impact, arrows of petrification acted as a powerful version of the flesh to stone spell, petrifying creatures vulnerable to such magics.\nThese enchanted arrows were famously wielded by Bliney Granter, a renowned basilisk hunter. He shot the missiles at his prey to either slow them down or petrify them, then finishing them up close with the Shattermaster, his enchanted hammer. Bliney Granters career ended ironically, when he accidentally pricked his finger on an arrow of petrification. His petrified remains were later proudly displayed in the Granter widows manor courtyard."
