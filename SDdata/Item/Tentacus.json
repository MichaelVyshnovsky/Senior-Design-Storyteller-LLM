        "mainbody": "The tentacus was the holy symbol of Garagos, the Reaver. \nThe tentacus was a flattened disc with five sharp protrusions extending from its perimeter. \nThe clergy of Garagos carried the tentacus to honor their lord, but they were quite adept at using it in combat as well. Garagos faithful could wield the tentacus effectively in hand to hand combat as well as when thrown."
