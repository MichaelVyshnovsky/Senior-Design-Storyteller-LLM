Ropes of climbing were magically animated ropes that could be commanded to tie or untie themselves.
A rope of climbing was a rope made from silk and weighed 3 pounds (1 kilogram), was  long, and was about as thick around as a wand. To those able to detect magic, the rope gave off a faint aura of transmutation magic. It could hold up to  in weight.
In magic shops, ropes of climbing sold for about 3,000 gold pieces in most economies. In the Underdark, superior versions of the ropes sold for almost double that value.
A rope of climbing was strong enough to support upwards of 3,000 pounds (1,400 kilograms), a feat in and of itself, but its special ability to knot or unknot itself was what made it so helpful when climbing. As long as someone were to hold one end of the rope, it could be commanded to fasten itself securely to any object within its reach in any direction. The rope could climb sideways, up, or down, moving like a snake to reach its goal where it would secure itself. When snaking along the ground or up or down a wall toward its goal, it moved at about a third the speed of a typical human.
A rope of climbing could also be ordered to form knots all along its length, making it easier to climb. The rope would knot itself every foot (30 centimeters) using up about 10 feet (3 meters) of its length to do so.
The superior ropes of climbing crafted in the Underdark also granted the user improved skill at climbing, and felt somewhat sticky.
To craft a rope of climbing, a spellcaster needed to be able to cast the animate rope spell. Crafting one of the superior versions typically took about six days.
