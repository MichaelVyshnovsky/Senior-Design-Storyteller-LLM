The '''Birthing Furnace''' was a powerful [[artifact]] created by the [[primordial]] [[Nehushta]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|79}}

==Abilities==
The Birthing Furnace had the ability to create living [[genasi]] babies. It was believed that the Birthing Furnace produced more babes than the handful that emerged from it, but that, due to malfunctions, those with manifestations other than [[Firesoul genasi|firesoul]] were consumed by the forge's fires before they could crawl forth.

The Birthing Furnace could only be activated once per year by using a special key at the proper time.

==History==
The Birthing Furnace was used by members of the [[Dominion of the Burned]] to replenish their numbers by creating new genasi babies each year. As of [[1479 DR]], the owner of the Furnace's key was the leader of the Burned, [[Brindol]]. 

The existence of this artifact was used to lend credence to the legend that estated Nehushta was the creator of the genasi race.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}}
