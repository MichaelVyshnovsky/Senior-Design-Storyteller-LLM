        "mainbody": "A waterskin was a bag or pouch of skin that was used to hold water, particularly in hot regions.\nWaterskins were often shaped like kidneys and made of goatskin, but they could also come in a variety of other styles. Faer√ªn,\nMagic waterskins existed throughout the Realms, particularly in Maztica.\n* A notable magical waterskin was the Maztican waterskin of pouring. This magic feathered waterskin was always full and could pour out a gallon of water every minute.\n* The decanter of salt water, which could be found in Undermountain, could turn any liquid poured into it into salt water.\n* Pikel Bouldershoulder carried a waterskin that had a nozzle attached to it he loved to fill it with holy water and squirt undead."
