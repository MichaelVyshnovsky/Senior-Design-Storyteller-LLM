        "Powers": "By simply grasping this wand the wielder was able to recognize any written or seen conjuration spell. The wielder could expend one of the wand's charges to cast ''[[unseen servant]]'' or ''[[monster summoning]]''. The wand could also be used to conjure a curtain of pure blackness that absorbed all light. The curtain could attain a maximum size of {{SI|600|sq ft}} but needed to reach from floor to ceiling and wall to wall wherever it was placed. A ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' could also be created with the wand, with a single color of the sphere appearing at a time from red to violet.",
