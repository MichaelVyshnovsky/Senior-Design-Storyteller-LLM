A '''''ring of negation''''' was a [[curse]]d [[ring]] useful for controlling captive [[mage]]s. The purpose of the ring was to prevent the wearer from casting spells. Whenever the mage wearing the ring attempted to use magic, searing pain shot up their arm.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4406|12}} In theory, the ring could be removed by cutting off the finger. However, since so many spells depended on complicated hand gestures, removing the ring by amputating a finger wasn't a practical option.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4410|13}}
