The '''''Sunphelm of Shaundaular''''' was jeweled crown that has at one point been the symbol for the rulership of the kingdoms of [[Ashanath]], [[Eltabranar]] and [[Arkaia]].

==Appearance==
The ''Sunphelm'' was a simple circlet crafted of [[silver]] with [[gold]]en runes. The crest of the crown had seven spikes, the peaks of which were inlaid with [[beljuril]]s that would glimmer with light, similar to the [[spell]] ''[[holy star]]''. The front of the ''sunphelm'' had three [[king's tears]] dangling from silver chains. Each of these exotic [[jewels]] held a vision from centuries before:

*A northern view from the ''arch'' in [[Shandaular]], showing the city c.{{Yearlink|-1000}}
*An opposite view from the same location showing the southern half of the city c.[[200 DR]]
*A view of [[Arkatuil]] and the [[bay of Dancing Dolphins]] c.[[750 DR]]

==Powers==
In addition to the ''holy star'' light effect given off by the ''Sunphelm's'' beljurils, it also contained contingent restorative magic. It would cast ''[[heal]]'' upon the wearer if they were about to die from injury, or ''[[energy drain]]''.

==History==
The origins of the ''sunphelm'' were unknown and it was originally discovered by the [[wizard]] [[Shan the Golden]] while working for the [[gold dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]]. It was found in a crypt beneath the [[Akanamere]], shortly before the [[Orcgate Wars|Orcgate opened]]. Shan wore the crown from the time she lead [[the Nars]] mercenaries, through her reign as queen of Ashanath and unto her death. It passed down for generations as her family ruled the kingdom from the city of Shandaular. It was during the era of [[Arkaius]] the [[archmage]] that the ''Sunphelm of Shaundaular'' earned its name.

The current whereabouts of the regal crown are unknown, but there have been rumors that it was being worn by a [[matron mother]] in the [[Underdark]] city of [[T'lindhet]].
