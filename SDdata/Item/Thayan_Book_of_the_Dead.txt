The '''''Thayan Book of the Dead''''' was an [[artifact]] [[book]] penned by a long-forgotten [[Thay]]an [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]], many years before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Thayan Book of the Dead'' not only held dark [[spell]]s of the [[Red Wizards]], but it also imbued the wielder with the power and knowledge needed to perform its horrific rites and rituals. In addition to its [[arcane]] power, the tome allowed the wielder to summon deadly [[undead]] creatures under the book's owner's control. Lastly, when the ''Thayan Book of the Dead'' was used alongside the ''[[Carcanet of the Dead]]''  and ''[[Lacings of the Dead]]'', the book granted the wielder boosted blocking, sprinting, and dodging skills, as well as increased their movement speed and physical power.

==History==
The ''Thayan Book of the Dead'' dated back to the years before [[Szass Tam]] claimed the position of the Zulkir of Necromancy from his [[vampire]] predecessor. The book's author was a Zulkir of Necromancy, whose name was lost to time. Only several copies of the book existed as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
