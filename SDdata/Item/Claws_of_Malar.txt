Claws of Malar were unique claw bracers that belonged to followers of Malar and were used in ritualistic hunts, ceremonies, and as personal weapons.
Typically created by the carrier, they were fashioned to mimic clawed beast paws, such as lion, or other clawed beast such as a tiger, or bear.
These weapons possessed a +1 enchantment wounding claw bracers.
The True Talons of the God were a specialized variety of these claws, only crafted from Malarite followers in the Divine Den in Bezentil.
