        "mainbody": "'''''Ogien's Scale''''' was the set of [[enchanted]] [[scale armor]] that belonged to a great [[barbarian]] hero from [[North Faer√ªn]] named [[Ogien]].",
        "Powers": "''Ogien's Scale'' allowed the wearer to plunge into animal rage up to three times per day for ninety seconds. This rage dramatically increasing their strength, speed, endurance, and reaction, however it made the wearer unable to cast divine of arcane spells. There was a small chance that the person in the state of animal rage could go [[Berserker|berserk]].",
        "History": "Long before [[1281 DR]], ''Ogien's Scale'' served a barbarian hero during his numerous conquests. The hero was renown for his [[bear]]-like stature and was said to wrestle wild [[wolves]] for entertainment. His death was prophesied to be \"under white paws\". Eventually, this prediction came to pass when the barbarian was killed in [[Icewind Dale]] by a pack of [[polar bear]]s. The enchanted scale mail was believed to have been buried with its master.\n\nIn 1281 DR, ''Ogien's Scale'' was found in the Field of Bones of the [[White Wyrm Iceberg]] deep in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The glacier served as [[Icasaracht]]'s lair."
