        "mainbody": "Ogiens Scale was the set of enchanted scale armor that belonged to a great barbarian hero from North Faer√ªn named Ogien.\nOgiens Scale allowed the wearer to plunge into animal rage up to three times per day for ninety seconds. This rage dramatically increasing their strength, speed, endurance, and reaction, however it made the wearer unable to cast divine of arcane spells. There was a small chance that the person in the state of animal rage could go berserk.\nLong before 1281 DR, Ogiens Scale served a barbarian hero during his numerous conquests. The hero was renown for his bear-like stature and was said to wrestle wild wolves for entertainment. His death was prophesied to be \"under white paws\". Eventually, this prediction came to pass when the barbarian was killed in Icewind Dale by a pack of polar bears. The enchanted scale mail was believed to have been buried with its master.\nIn 1281 DR, Ogiens Scale was found in the Field of Bones of the White Wyrm Iceberg deep in the Sea of Moving Ice. The glacier served as Icasarachts lair."
