'''''Keoghtom's ointment''''' was an unguent used to clear [[poison]]s and disease, and heal wounds.

==Description==
The salve was a magic item that was named after Keoghtom.<ref group="note">Keoghtom is the hero-deity of [[Oerth]] who befriended [[Mordenkainen]] and traveled the [[Astral Sea]]. He mainly appeared in the [[Greyhawk]] campaign setting. The unguent [[jar]] was small, about {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|1|in|long=yes}} deep. One to three jars were commonly found together. It was a thick mixture that smelt faintly of aloe.

==Powers==
When placed upon a poisoned wound, or swallowed, it detoxified poisons and diseases. If rubbed on the body, it healed moderate wounds.

''Keoghtom's ointment'' could be used alongside [[everwater]] to create a magical solution that allowed for preservation of monster tissues as well as magic that was held inside. Such preserved items included [[beholder]] eyes that, when soaked in this solution, retained their magical gazes for indefinite amount of time.{{Cite dragon/164/Treasures that lead to adventures|81}}
