Keoghtoms ointment was an unguent used to clear poisons and disease, and heal wounds.
The salve was a magic item that was named after Keoghtom.Keoghtom is the hero-deity of Oerth who befriended Mordenkainen and traveled the Astral Sea. He mainly appeared in the Greyhawk campaign setting. The unguent jar was small, about  in diameter and  deep. One to three jars were commonly found together. It was a thick mixture that smelt faintly of aloe.
When placed upon a poisoned wound, or swallowed, it detoxified poisons and diseases. If rubbed on the body, it healed moderate wounds.
Keoghtoms ointment could be used alongside everwater to create a magical solution that allowed for preservation of monster tissues as well as magic that was held inside. Such preserved items included beholder eyes that, when soaked in this solution, retained their magical gazes for indefinite amount of time.
