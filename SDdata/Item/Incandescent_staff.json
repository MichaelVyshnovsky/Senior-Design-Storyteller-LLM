An incandescent staff also granted them resistance to magical and mundane flame and improved their spellcasting aim. Lastly, the wielder could cast the fire bolt cantrip at will and the fireball spell once per day, using the staffs magic.\nIn the , one such staff was in stock of Talli, a Harper quartermaster who followed the druid Harper hero Jaheira into the Shadow-cursed Lands in the Western Heartlands."
