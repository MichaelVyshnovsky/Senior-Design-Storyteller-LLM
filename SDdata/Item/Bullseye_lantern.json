        "mainbody": "A '''bullseye lantern''' was a type of lantern which focused the source of light to illuminate only in a specific direction.",
        "Description": "Like [[hooded lantern]]s, typical bullseye lanterns consisted of a metallic frame enclosing glass panels, within which a [[wick]] connected to a reservoir of [[oil]] burned and shed light as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for {{SI|1|pint|ml|long=yes}} of oil. The difference was that a bullseye lantern was almost entirely covered in a reflective metal housing with only a single aperture (the \"bullseye\") which allowed light to escape, illuminating significantly farther than a hooded lantern, but only in a limited direction.",
        "Availability": "* In [[Athkatla]], one could find bullseye lanterns for sale in the market [[Waukeen's Promenade]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"Duty\">''[[For Duty & Deity]]'' states that every nonmagical item featured in the ''[[Arms and Equipment Guide]]'' can be purchased at Waukeen's Promenade.\n* Bullseye lanterns were available for purchase through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']].\n* In [[Zhentil Keep]], the store [[Lita's Equipment]] sold similar bullseye lanterns to those sold in ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' for 14 [[gold piece]]s.<ref>"
