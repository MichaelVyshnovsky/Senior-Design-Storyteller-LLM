        "mainbody": "A bullseye lantern was a type of lantern which focused the source of light to illuminate only in a specific direction.\nLike hooded lanterns, typical bullseye lanterns consisted of a metallic frame enclosing glass panels, within which a wick connected to a reservoir of oil burned and shed light as long as the supply of fuel lasted, typically 6 hours for  of oil. The difference was that a bullseye lantern was almost entirely covered in a reflective metal housing with only a single aperture (the \"bullseye\") which allowed light to escape, illuminating significantly farther than a hooded lantern, but only in a limited direction.\n* In Athkatla, one could find bullseye lanterns for sale in the market Waukeens Promenade.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* Bullseye lanterns were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\n* In Zhentil Keep, the store Litas Equipment sold similar bullseye lanterns to those sold in Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 14 gold pieces."
