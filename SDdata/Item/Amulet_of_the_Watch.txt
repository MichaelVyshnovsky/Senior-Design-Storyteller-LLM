An amulet of the watch was a magical amulet that was worn by the captains of the City Watch of Waterdeep during the 14 century DR.
The amulet was crafted in the shape of a tiny shield and was emblazoned with the Waterdhavian city crest.
Once per day, the wearer of the amulet could cast whispering wind as per the spell. This ability was often used to summon additional members of the Watch or request help from the City Guard.
