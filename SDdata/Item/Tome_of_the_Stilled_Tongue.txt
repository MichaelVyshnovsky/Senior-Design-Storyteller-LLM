The '''''Tome of the Stilled Tongue''''' was a heinous [[spellbook]] created by a treacherous servant of [[Vecna]]. There existed five copies of the tome, though which of them was the original was unknown.

==Description==
These books were thick volumes bound in leather, each grisly decorated with a dessicated tongue [[nail]]ed to their cover. The first few pages of each tome were taken up by indecipherable script. The tongue on the first copy of this tome belonged to the treacherous [[priest]] of Vecna, who was terrible at keeping secrets, whilst the tongues on the other four copies belonged to [[spellcaster]]s that had crossed Vecna. These tongues could only be removed by those attuned to the book and once done it would permanently erase all spells written within it.

==Powers==
Each copy of the ''Tome of the Stilled Tongue'' contained variety of [[wizard]] [[spell]]s, instructions for creating a [[lich]]'s [[phylactery]], and eldritch mental exercises for improving one's spellcasting abilities. There were also 500 blank pages that one could write their own spells in. These pages functioned similarly to those found within a copy of ''[[Boccob's blessed book]]'', Additionally, the book could function as a [[spell focus]] and could be used to cast spells without the need of [[somatic]] or [[verbal]] components.

Originally these tomes could only be utilized by worshipers of Vecna,

==Crafting==
Crafting a copy of the ''Tome of the Stilled Tongue'' required not only knowledge of how to craft wondrous items and sanctify relics, but one had to have the spell ''[[secret page]]'' and be a worshiper of Vecna.
