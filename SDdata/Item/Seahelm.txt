The Seahelm was a magical helmet that provided the wearer with protection.
This helm had a +2 enchantment.
In 1358 DR, the helmet was stashed amongst treasure in Orlumbor. Specifically, it was hidden in a temple of Talos to the south of the city-state, and was protected by those of the Kraken Society, Host Tower of the Arcane, and Zhentarim. However, the Heroes of Ascore slew them, and found vital intel, as well as the helm.
