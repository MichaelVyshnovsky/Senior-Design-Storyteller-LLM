Sarutobis Stone Breakers were unique enchanted bracers created in the distant land of Shou Lung.
Created to be worn only by law-abiding human monks, these gauntlets increased the wearers strength, allowed for increased damage done when the monk used their fists in combat, and dramatically increased critical damage.
Sometime before 1281 DR, Sarutobis Stone Breakers were commissioned by a good-meaning merchant for a legendarily skilled Shou monk Sarutobi for his upcoming battle with a fearsome rock giant. The legend stated that the martial artist declined the gift thinking his talent was enough to crush the giants skull, and he needed no magical aid. Sarutobi was right. He won the duel, and the Stone Breakers were locked away in the merchants vault. Subsequently, the martial artist went missing after entering a gate that took him to the part unknown. Following Sarutobis presumed death, the merchant gifted the Stone Breakers to the monks son, who devoted the rest of his life to unsuccessful search for his father.
Years later, by 1281 DR Sarutobis Stone Breakers found their way to the freezing Icewind Dale and into the hands of a halfling cleric of Waukeen. Quinn Silverfinger, the cleric of the Golden Lodge in Lonelywood offered these unique bracers for sale.
