'''''Sarutobi's Stone Breakers''''' were unique [[enchanted]] [[bracer]]s created in the distant land of [[Shou Lung]].

==Powers==
Created to be worn only by law-abiding [[human]] [[monk]]s, these gauntlets increased the wearer's strength, allowed for increased damage done when the monk used their fists in combat, and dramatically increased critical damage.

==History==
Sometime before [[1281 DR]], ''Sarutobi's Stone Breakers'' were commissioned by a good-meaning merchant for a legendarily skilled [[Shou]] monk [[Sarutobi]] for his upcoming battle with a fearsome [[rock giant]]. The legend stated that the martial artist declined the gift thinking his talent was enough to crush the giant's skull, and he needed no magical aid. Sarutobi was right. He won the duel, and the ''Stone Breakers'' were locked away in the merchant's vault. Subsequently, the martial artist went missing after entering a ''[[planar gate|gate]]'' that took him to the part unknown. Following Sarutobi's presumed death, the merchant gifted the ''Stone Breakers'' to the monk's son, who devoted the rest of his life to unsuccessful search for his father.

Years later, by 1281 DR ''Sarutobi's Stone Breakers'' found their way to the freezing [[Icewind Dale]] and into the hands of a [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Waukeen]]. [[Quinn Silverfinger]], the cleric of the [[Golden Lodge]] in [[Lonelywood]] offered these unique bracers for sale.
