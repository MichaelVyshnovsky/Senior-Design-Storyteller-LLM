The ''[[crown of Corellon]]'' was a legendary [[cleric]]'s [[circlet]] from [[Waterdeep]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The crown of Corellon was encrusted with glowing magical [[gems]], each represented Halbenet's friend whom they failed to save. Their crown glowed with gentle radiance, reminding them to always defend the friends who were still surrounding them.

==Powers==
The ''crown of Corellon'' enhanced the divine magical abilities of the cleric who wore it and provided some level of defense. The crown's main powers, however, laid in the supremely powerful ''[[heal]]ing'' it bestowed on the wearer and their allies.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Halbenet Soladonel]]: a [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Corellon Larethian]] who worked with other warriors of [[Waterdeep]], performing missions on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
