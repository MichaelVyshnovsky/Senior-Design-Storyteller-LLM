        "mainbody": "he harness of Seker was a boon granted by Seker to those in need.\nThe device was shaped like a glove with holes for fingers, and a harness extending down the wrist and forearm.\nThe harness only worked for good-aligned clerics and even then only to destroy undead it was in fact harmful to touch by anyone who was not good-aligned.\nThe harness vibrated if undead were within . While worn by a good-aligned cleric, should they extend this arm towards an undead in sight within that range and speak Sekers name, the harness would blast the undead with an extremely powerful bolt, certain to annihilate any but the most powerful undead on the spot.\nThe harness granted by the altar in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak held up to five charges, depending on the object sacrificed to it.\nAn altar of Seker granted the harness of Seker to those who sacrificed a magical item in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak. When that one ran out of charges, it returned the item sacrificed no individual would be granted the harness twice."
