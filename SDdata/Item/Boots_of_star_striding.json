        "Powers": "In addition to allowing travel across gravity planes, albeit at half speed, these boots continually oriented their wearer to, and between, these planes. The wearer could leap between, fall, or otherwise maneuver between the planes, or the surface of spelljammers, with no oscillation.\n\nLike most magical footwear, ''boots of star striding'' shrunk or grew to snugly fit the feet of their wearer.",
