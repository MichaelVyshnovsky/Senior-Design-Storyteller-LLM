        "mainbody": "A gloom candle was a darkly enchanted candle used by necromancers.\nWhen lit, a gloom candle filled a  sphere with inky shadow that negated any form of light or darkness within the area. Evil-doers within the sphere found it easier to control any undead also found within the sphere, or could attempt to control undead if they were not previously able, while clerics of the light found it much harder to control or turn undead. Undead bathed by the shadows of a gloom candle would regenerate from physical harm.\nA gloom candle could burn for up to one hour once lit.\nNebt Bhakau of Zakhara detailed the recipe for making a gloom candle in his tome the Book of Shadows. Only a skilled necromancer or cleric of death could make one."
