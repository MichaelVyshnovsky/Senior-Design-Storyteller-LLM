A '''shovel''' was a digging tool that had a curved blade on its end. A very similar tool was the '''spade'''.

==Description==
The ideal shovel had a four-foot-long wooden handle and a curved metal head with a blunt edge, allowing it to carry soil and not be damaged from cutting into heavy earth. [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]] [[Hoe]]s served a similar purpose in breaking up soil, though they were used quite differently.

==Availability==
{{Quote
|A farmer's main weapon in battling the land, shovels come in as many varieties as do [[sword]]s.
|Advertisement from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]
}}

Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold generic and specialized shovels. Basic [[coal]] shovels cost 2 [[gp]], gardening and snow shovels cost 3 gp, whilst postholers cost 4 gp each. Small hand spades could be had for only 2 [[sp]].

==Magic==
There were several [[magic]]al shovels known around the [[multiverse]].

* A mysterious shovel was kept in a chamber of the [[Hordelands]]. When touched, the shovel would disappear, having teleported to another chamber and leaving a ''[[fireball]]'' in its place.
* Shovels could be found on a ''[[robe of useful items]]''.
* A miniature version of such a tool was a required [[material component]] in casting the ''[[dig]]'' [[spell]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|249}}, the [[Magister]] [[Galeerie Mulurkrath]] was killed by a shovel to the head.

The symbol of [[Fireshear]] was that of a crossed [[pickaxe]], [[blade]], and shovel.

In [[Zakhara]], the [[Pick and Shovel Corps]] was a group of ex-[[slave]]s that won their freedom. The "shovels" indicated the dwarf members of the corps.
