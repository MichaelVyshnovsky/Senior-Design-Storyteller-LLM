A shovel was a digging tool that had a curved blade on its end. A very similar tool was the spade. 
The ideal shovel had a four-foot-long wooden handle and a curved metal head with a blunt edge, allowing it to carry soil and not be damaged from cutting into heavy earth. Kara-Tur, and Zakhara Hoes served a similar purpose in breaking up soil, though they were used quite differently.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold generic and specialized shovels. Basic coal shovels cost 2 gp, gardening and snow shovels cost 3 gp, whilst postholers cost 4 gp each. Small hand spades could be had for only 2 sp.
