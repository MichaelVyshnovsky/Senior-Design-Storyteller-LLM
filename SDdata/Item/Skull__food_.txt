'''Skulls''' were a traditional type of pastry from the nation of [[Chessenta]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Description==
Skulls were named after their round shape and white [[sugar]] icing. These handfoods were small dough balls made with heavy [[cream]], [[flour]], [[egg]]s, and copious amounts of sugar. The balls were shaped and pinched at one spot to give them a rough but distinct skull-like shape. After cooking, skulls were covered in white icing.

These pastries were a traditional holiday treat in Chessenta during the annual [[Deadwinter Day]] celebration.
