        "Description": "Heartwine was a famous [[wine]] that originated in the [[planes]] from the town of [[Curst (gate-town)|Curst]], where its recipe was kept in great secrecy. Despite being made out of a species of less-than-appealing plants, heartwine possessed a breathtaking bouquet, and as to its taste, it was full-bodied, fruity, and ever so slightly sour.\n\nRazorvine leaves were harvested and fermented to make heartwine.",
        "Availability": "Curst exported its famed wine. It could be found served by Barkis, the proprietor of the [[Smoldering Corpse Bar]] in the planar City of Portals, [[Sigil]], where it was valued at 100 [[gold pieces]]. The recipe was known to the Cilenei Brothers, who originated on the [[Prime Material plane]]. The brothers were [[mage]]s who'd developed some magical means of creating the wine. On the Prime, heartwine was fermented by [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] of Menzoberranzan in the [[Underdark]]. The vintage of [[1353 DR]] was in some demand among the [[drow]]."
