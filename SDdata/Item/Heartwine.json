Despite being made out of a species of less-than-appealing plants, heartwine possessed a breathtaking bouquet, and as to its taste, it was full-bodied, fruity, and ever so slightly sour.\nRazorvine leaves were harvested and fermented to make heartwine.\nCurst exported its famed wine. It could be found served by Barkis, the proprietor of the Smoldering Corpse Bar in the planar City of Portals, Sigil, where it was valued at 100 gold pieces. The recipe was known to the Cilenei Brothers, who originated on the Prime Material plane. The brothers were mages whod developed some magical means of creating the wine. On the Prime, heartwine was fermented by House Barrison DelArmgo of Menzoberranzan in the Underdark. The vintage of 1353 DR was in some demand among the drow."
