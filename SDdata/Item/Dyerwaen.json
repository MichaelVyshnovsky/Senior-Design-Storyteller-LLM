        "mainbody": "'''''Dyerwaen''''' was a unique, ''+2 non-[[intelligent item|intelligent]] [[chaotic good]]'' [[magic]]al [[broadsword]] from ancient [[Myth Drannor]], which aided its wielder when traveling through forested areas. Despite having no sentience, it was regarded as possessing a [[chaotic good]] alignment.{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}}",
        "Description": "The sword ''Dyerwaen'' was a fine [[steel]] broadsword with the etching of a rose along its blade and a hilt wrapped tightly with green velvet. When drawn in forest settings, the sword's wielder was [[magic]]ally camouflaged, appeared more charming to [[elves]] and [[fey]] creatures and, when so desired, could radiate light 10' (3 m) outward from the blade. In addition, ''Dyerwaen'' would always point true north when suspended from a [[rope]], granted insight in tracking animals and discerning weather patterns to its wielder and, upon uttering a selected [[command word]], allowed them to ''[[speak with plants]]'' or gain ''[[invisibility to animals]]'' as per the respective [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "The sword nicknamed the ''Forester's Friend'' was forged by the [[gray elves]] of Myth Drannor, during the years when [[human|men]] first forayed into the region that would come to be known as the [[Dalelands]]. It was gifted to the patriarch of the first human settlement, [[Torek Graybeard]], as a memento of the growing friendship between the two races. After Torek's death, the blade was passed down to his nephew [[Tireen]], who bore it for six years until his untimely disappearance after an excursion out hunting.\n\n''Dyerwaen'' reappeared generations later, during the mid–14{{th}} century, in the possession of a band of [[goblin]] raiders. After the creatures were killed by a group of adventurers, the blade was taken to an auction house in [[Cormyr]] where it was sold, and while ''en route'' to being delivered, stolen by [[thieves]]. Its whereabouts after the heist continue to be unknown."
