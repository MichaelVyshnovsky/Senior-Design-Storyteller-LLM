        "mainbody": "A '''''graystaff''''' was a powerful [[wizard]]s' [[staff]] that could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was associated with the [[Blackstaff Academy]].",
        "Powers": "The wielder of a ''graystaff'' was said to become inspiring to their allies. It could be used to cast both offensive and supportive [[spell]]s simultaneously, so a wielder might be able to blast an enemy and apply ''[[haste]]'' to an ally at the same time. However, this feature of the staff did not always work properly.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Vajra Safahr]], the [[Blackstaff]] of Waterdeep during the late 15{{th}} century DR, was said to also possess a ''graystaff''."
