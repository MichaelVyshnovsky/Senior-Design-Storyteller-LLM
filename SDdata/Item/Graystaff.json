        "mainbody": "graystaff was a powerful wizards staff that could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR. It was associated with the Blackstaff Academy.\nThe wielder of a graystaff was said to become inspiring to their allies. It could be used to cast both offensive and supportive spells simultaneously, so a wielder might be able to blast an enemy and apply haste to an ally at the same time. However, this feature of the staff did not always work properly.\n* Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaff of Waterdeep during the late 15 century DR, was said to also possess a graystaff."
