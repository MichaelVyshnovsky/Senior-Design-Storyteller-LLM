        "mainbody": "Blade boots, or bladeboots, were nasty footwear with concealed, spring-loaded daggers in the soles, worn by some rogues and adventurers.\nBlade boots were constructed from sturdy leather and typically custom-designed to an already existing pair of boots. The sole assembly was sturdy and hid the steel blade, which was activated by a heel-kick mechanism. Modified boots weighed about .\nBlade boots were most effective when used in a surprise attack, typically after the wearer was apprehended and stripped of weapons. Blade boots housed a dagger-sized blade within the sole of the boot. The blade was triggered by clicking the heels together, causing it to spring forward where it could be used with kicking attacks.\nAs long as the blade was hidden, a wearer could move just as easily as in a normal pair of boots, but with a blade out, it made it difficult to run.\nA blade boot was also handy for escaping from ropes if bound.\nthumb|right|250px|A spelldancer wearing a blade boot.\nA single boot cost 15 gold pieces to modify. Pairs of blade boots were available for purchase through Auroras Emporium for that same price, though they cost double that most places elsewhere.\nThey were commonly employed as an escape device, since captured thieves were usually relieved of their weapons but not their footwear."
