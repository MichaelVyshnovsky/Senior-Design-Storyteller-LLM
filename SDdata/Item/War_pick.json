        "mainbody": "'''War picks''', also known as '''military picks''', were a type of [[pick]]axe designed specifically for warfare.",
        "Description": "War picks generally consisted of one or two curved, heavy piercing flukes mounted upon a shaft. Some shafts were known to be spiked at the end. These thick curved flukes, also known as \"crow's beaks,\" help to balance the war pick's hammer head.",
        "Weaponology": "All war picks were designed to pierce through heavier armor types, from [[chain mail]] all the way up to full [[plate armor]]. However, they could get stuck if swung too hard. Some training was required to wield them effectively, thus they were often considered martial weapons.\n\nDespite having a similar appearance, ''war picks'' were noted as being ineffective tools for climbing compared to [[ice axe]]s.",
        "Variations": {
            "Footman's pick": "'''Footman's picks''' were the larger and heavier variety of war pick. Their name derived from the fact that they were most often wielded by infantry soldiers. They generally were {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} long.",
            "Horseman's pick": "'''Horseman's picks''' were the lighter variety of war pick, their name derived from the fact that they were most often wielded by mounted [[knight]]s and heavy mercenary horsemen."

        "Notable Users of War picks": {
            "Groups": "* Despite being designed for the purpose of warfare, footman's picks were often utilized by prospectors as a digging tool.\n* Footman's picks were a common weapon among both [[human]] and [[demihuman]] races all across [[Faerun]].\n* War picks were known to be frequently used by smaller races such as [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, [[deep gnome]]s, [[duergar]], and [[halfling]]s. Gnomes often favored the lighter variety as an off-hand weapon, though they and halflings were both known for using the heavier variety as a two-handed weapon.\n* War picks were popular among knights and the footmen of some mercenary companies."
