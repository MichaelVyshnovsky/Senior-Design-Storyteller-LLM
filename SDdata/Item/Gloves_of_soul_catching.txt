The '''''gloves of soul catching''''' was a unique set of [[monk]] gloves once used by [[Autumnal Baskin]], a professional meditator and a bare-knuckle champion, sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''gloves of soul catching'' could be worn by anyone, but they were most useful to a monk or a similar hand-to-hand combatant. The wearer's unarmed attacks received a magical force damage boost; additionally, once per six seconds, one successful unarmed attack restored the wearer's health. However, the wearer could choose to dismiss healing magic and receive a boost of another nature instead – an advantage in aiming and landing hits, as well as a slight boost to their reactions and protections for the next six seconds. Lastly, the gloves significantly boosted constitution while the gloves were worn.

==History==
The ''gloves' of soul catching'' original owner was a well-known negotiator and a mêlée fighter – Autumnal Baskin, sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the gloves were in the hands of [[Hope]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[cleric]], imprisoned in the so-called [[House of Hope (Avernus)|House of Hope]] in [[Avernus]] by [[Raphael]], a [[cambion]] spawn of [[Mephistopheles]].
