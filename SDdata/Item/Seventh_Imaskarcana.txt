==Description==
The ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' resembled a large, golden key.{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|8}}

==Powers==
The ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' held the entire body of Imaskari knowledge about creating permanent extradimensional spaces. It likely had other powers as well; those probably put it in line with the powers and abilities of the [[First Imaskarcana|''First Imaskarcana'']] and [[Fifth Imaskarcana|''Fifth Imaskarcana'']], as well as probably the [[Third Imaskarcana|''Third Imaskarcana'']].

==History==
The ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' was created under the orders of Lord Omanond in {{yearlink|-3891}}.


It may have been rediscovered by a priest of Bhaal, named [[Tyaral]], from a ruin known as [[Maskana]]. The ruin was an outpost, which had been built atop an abandoned Imaskari complex razed by the Mulan slaves during their revolt. The Imaskari in the complex took all their books and valuables before abandoning it, but an earlier cohort of artificers had secretly hidden the ''Seventh Imaskarcana'' there, so that the inhabitants of the complex could serve as unwitting guards.

==Notable Owners==
