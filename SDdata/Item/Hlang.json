        "mainbody": "A '''hlang''' was a [[Chult]]an oval-shaped, hide shield, most common in the cities of [[Mezro]]",
        "Description": "An oval hlang was {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} wide and between {{SIrange|4|6|ft|long=yes}} tall. It consisted of animal hide&mdash;often [[dinosaur]] hide&mdash;fitted over a wooden frame. The shield was designed to be collapsible; the hide could easily be removed, rolled up, and used as a chair or pillow, while the frame could be folded up for easy storage.\n\nA hlang was approximately equivalent to a typical [[tower shield|large wooden shield]] in terms of weight and defensive capabilities.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Priest]]s in the [[Church of Eshowdow]].<ref>\n* High-ranking priests in the [[Church of Ubtao]].<ref>\n* Members of the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] tribe were particularly known to be proficient in the use of hlangs."
