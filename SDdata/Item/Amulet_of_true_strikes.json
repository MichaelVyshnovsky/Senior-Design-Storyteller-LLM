        "mainbody": "The amulet of true strikes was an enchanted amulet worn by rangers around Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe wearer of an amulet of true strikes was more deadly in battle. When the amulet activated, the wearers attacks struck truer and more powerfully, akin to being under the effect of a true strike spell. However, the amulet did not always activate reliably.\n* Saarvin, a dragonborn ranger and adventurer possessed an amulet of true strikes while working with Laeral Silverhand in the late 15 century DR."
