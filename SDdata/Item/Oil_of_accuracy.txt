Oil of accuracy was a magic oil used to coat weapons to improve the wielders aim.
The effects of the oil of accuracy was similar to that of a +2 enchantment that guided the wielders hand towards the targets. Unlike a weapon enchantment, effects of this magic oil were temporary.
One of the oil of accuracy recipes was made using ashes of the daggerroot plant and special types of alchemical salts.
