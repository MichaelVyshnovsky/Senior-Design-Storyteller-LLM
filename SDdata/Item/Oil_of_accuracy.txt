'''''Oil of accuracy''''' was a [[magic]] [[oil]] used to coat [[weapon]]s to improve the wielder's aim.

==Powers==
The effects of the ''oil of accuracy'' was similar to that of a ''+2'' [[enchantment]] that guided the wielder's hand towards the targets. Unlike a weapon enchantment, effects of this magic oil were temporary.

==Creations==
One of the ''oil of accuracy'' recipes was made using ashes of the [[daggerroot]] plant and special types of alchemical [[salt]]s.
