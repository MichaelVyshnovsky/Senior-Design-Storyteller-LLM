        "Powers": "If this dart missed a living target, it did nothing and could be reused. However, if it successfully struck a target, it emitted a shrill, shrieking noise. This scream disrupted the target's ability to cast [[spell]]s and acted as an unmistakable alarm. The sound emanated from a precise location, making the target easily trackable. Even if the dart was removed, the noise continued to accompany the victim for a short period after the impact."
