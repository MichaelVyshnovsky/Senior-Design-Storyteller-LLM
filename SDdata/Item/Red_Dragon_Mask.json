It was worn by the cults leader, Severin Silrajin for a time during the 1480s DR.\nThe Red Dragon Mask was a lustrous, crimson color and featured the archetypical rear-facing horns and ridge spikes associated with red dragons.\nThe wearer of the Red Dragon Mask gained resistance to any any harm caused by fire, along with protection from physical harm. Whenever they struck a creature or ignitable object with flame-related magic or any incendiary weapons, their target would catch aflame. The wearer was also granted darkvision and blindsight, along with an the understanding of the Draconic language.\nThe main feature of the Red Dragon Mask, along with the other dragon masks, was to transform its wearer into a wyrmspeaker. These individuals were granted thought processes similar to those of dragons, and granted slight influence over their behavior.\nWhen two or more of the masks were brought together, they reformed as the Mask of the Dragon Queen, which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the ritual to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells.\nAs of the 1480s DR, the Red Dragon Mask was believed to be found somewhere in Icewind Dale. The Red Wizard Rath Modar led the search for the mask on behalf of the Cult of the Dragon, and of course his own aims, but his efforts were thwarted by a band of adventurers directed by five of the most powerful factions of the Sword Coast.\nIt was finally uncovered on the isle of Tuern, in the Trackless Sea, and taken by the dragon cults leader, Severin Silrajin. He took the powerful artifact back with him to the Well of Dragons, the site where he planned to summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells."
