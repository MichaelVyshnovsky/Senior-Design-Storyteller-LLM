        "Powers": "The wearer of the ''Red Dragon Mask'' gained resistance to any any harm caused by fire, along with protection from physical harm. Whenever they struck a creature or ignitable object with flame-related magic or any incendiary weapons, their target would catch aflame. The wearer was also granted [[darkvision]] and [[blindsight]], along with an the understanding of the [[Draconic language]].\n\nThe main feature of the ''Red Dragon Mask'', along with the other ''dragon masks'', was to transform its wearer into a [[wyrmspeaker]]. These individuals were granted thought processes similar to those of [[dragon]]s, and granted slight influence over their behavior.\n\nWhen two or more of the masks were brought together, they reformed as the ''[[Mask of the Dragon Queen]]'', which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the [[ritual]] to free Tiamat from the [[Nine Hells]].",
