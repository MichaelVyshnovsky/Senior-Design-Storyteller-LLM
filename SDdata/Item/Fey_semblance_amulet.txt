The '''''fey semblance amulet''''' was a [[magic]]al [[amulet]] from the [[Feywild]] created some centuries before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''fey semblance amulet'' was made using [[gem]]stones that, in reality, were kidney stones of some unknown [[archfey]].

==Powers==
The amulet's wearer had their intelligence, wisdom, and charisma fortified greatly, similarly to the qualities of many fey that resided in the Feywild.

==History==
The ''fey semblance amulet'' had been "passed down through the centuries" until it ended up in the hands of [[Mayrina]] of the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]] who sought to end the sinister child-abducting plots of the [[hag]] who called herself [[Auntie Ethel]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The ''fey semblance amulet'' could've been passed down as a reward for ending the hag's life.
