A zombie door was an enchanted door that attacked intruders.
A zombie door was bound in human skin, and two or three pairs of arms were affixed to it.
The arms were capable of clutching at people passing by, and of using weapons to attack. Those weapons could be concealed in the folds of the human skin around the door.
However, they could be turned, destroyed, or controlled.
The zombie doors were created by The Trapmaster in the late 13 century DR.
