A '''''rod of flailing''''' was a [[magic item]] that could be used as a weapon in combat.

==Powers==
These items gave off a hint of [[alteration]] [[magic]] under scrutiny from a ''[[detect magic]]'' [[spell]].

When the [[command word]] was uttered the rod would transform into an enchanted double-headed [[flail]]. The flail would be an appropriate size for the wielder's current surroundings. Each of the flail's heads could be used to attack a target at the same time, effectively doubling the amount of potential harm from an attack. The heads could be used twice on a single target, or once each for two targets standing side by side.

Regardless of if the item was in rod or flail form, the wielder could expend a single charge to make it more difficult for opponents to strike them in combat. This magical effect lasted for ten minutes once activated.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Mathlas]], a high [[priest]] of [[Bane]].<ref>
* [[Rukn ud-Din Mahmud]], a caravan guard captain in the [[Hordelands]], carried a ''rod of flailing''.
