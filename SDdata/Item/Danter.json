        "mainbody": "he danter (sometimes spelled dantar, or lovingly â€“ \"little pearl\") was a gold coin minted in Amn and used as standard currency there. Its value was equivalent to one gold piece.\nGold danters were pressed with the image of a circle of six tiny stars on one side. Gold coins were the default currency in Amn, and all prices were generally listed in Danters.\nA single gold danter was worth 200 fandars, 20 tarans, or 2 centaurs, while 1 roldon was worth 5 danters. The two most common trade bar denominations pressed in Amn were for 500 or 1000 danters. However, there were trade bards worth as much as 3.5 million danters.\nWhen dealing in currencies from other nations, Zazesspurs gulder was less valued than Amnian danter. 100 danter could buy you 107 gulders in the late 14 century DR. When dealing in Ithmongs currency, 113 moleans bought 100 danters. 138 Myratmas myrats were worth 100 danters, and 175 Saradushs zoths were worth 100 danters.\nCounterfeiting Amnian coins was illegal in Tethyr to no surprise, punishable by a strict prison sentence and public shaming after the confiscation of assets of deemed equal value to the damages done to the country. The oldest counterfeiting practice in Tethyr consisted of melting copper coins down and pressing them into danter shapes. A gilding layer finished the illusion of an authentic danter."
