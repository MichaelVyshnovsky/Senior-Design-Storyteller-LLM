        "Description": "The Calishites added [[curry]] to give this cheese some extra kick while preserving it at the same time. The [[spice]] also added a pale beige, Its taste was called ''rumnund'' in Calimshan and it had a long-lasting shelf life and was the least-crumbly among a wide variety of curry cheeses made in the nation.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-02-24 - Elturian Grey and Green Calishite}}",
        "Prices": "Green Calishite cheese could be purchased in the following sizes:\n* Loaf, 1/2 lb. (0.23 kg.) 4 [[sp]]",
        "Reputation": "This cheese was considered to be far too spicy for the tastes of most [[North Faerûn|northerners]]. It was said that a northerner could be incapacitated if they took an unsuspecting bite of it.\n\nTraditionally, Green Calishite was eaten by itself or used to thicken sauces. The cheese paired well with [[wine]]s, [[cordial]]s, and spirits."
