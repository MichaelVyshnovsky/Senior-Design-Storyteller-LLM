        "mainbody": "'''''Runepowder''''' was a dangerous and extremely volatile [[gnome|gnomish]] substance that was believed to be a myth by many as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The recipe for ''runepowder'' was a tightly guarded secret believed to be lost or rare and almost mythical. The substance was a certain mixture of [[smokepowder]] and gnomish magics.",
        "Powers": "It was said that a single vial of ''runepowder'' packed more wallop than a barrelful of smokepowder. Some exaggerated the substance's power claiming it was volatile enough to level the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. In reality, a vial of ''rune power'' had more than double the explosive power of a barrel of smokepowder.",
        "History": "It was believed that ''runepowder'' was a creation of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], a gnomish deity known as the Shield of the Golden Hills. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, all records of the substance had been stricken from historic records due to the dangers associated with the substance. The only creatures who still remembered of its existence were gnomes, yet even among them, many believed ''runepowder'' to be a children's tale.\n\nShortly before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a [[svirfneblin]] of the [[Ironhand]] gnomes named [[Wulbren]], from the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], uncovered a ''runepowder'' formula. Its written copy was destroyed in an encounter with members of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in 1492 DR, making Wulbren's mind the last existing record of the invaluable recipe. A deep gnome named [[Philomeen]] tried to claim an unknown amount of ''runepowder'' and escape from [[duergar]] slavery. She hoped to use the substance to aid her people."
