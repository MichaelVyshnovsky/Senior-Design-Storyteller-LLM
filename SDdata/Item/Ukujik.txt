An '''ukujik''', also referred to as a cutting house, was a structure used by [[Iulutiun]].

==Description==
An ukujik was a dome with a diameter of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} that served the purpose of animal butchering. Within the dome, a snow partition separated it into two halves, rising approximately {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} from the floor. One half contains two pits that were {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} deep, known as the [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''ijukujik'']], while the other half without pits is called the [[Ulutiun dictionary#A|''akukujik'']]. Each section had its own doorway for access.

In the akukujik, hunters carried out the task of game butchering, while they discarded organs and blubber over the partition into the ijukujik. The organs were placed in one pit, while the blubber was deposited in the other pit. The surplus in the ijukujik pits was available for villagers to freely take for themselves.
