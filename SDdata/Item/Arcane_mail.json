        "mainbody": "'''''Arcane mail''''' was the enchanted set of [[plate mail]] that once belonged to one of the original [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], [[Jelde Asturien]].",
        "Description": "''Arcane mail'' was a set of heavy armor covered in magical sigils and runes.",
        "Powers": "This unique plate armor had a ''+2'' enchantment and dramatically improved the wearer's defense. The most notable thing about the ''arcane mail'' was that this item's magic allowed a [[wizard]] to wear it with no adverse impact on their spellcasting ability, apart from the armor's weight.",
        "History": "At some point before [[1369 DR]], while exploring the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], Jelde Asturien found his way into the ancient tomb under the mansion of [[House Ammath]] in the [[Glim-Gardens]] district and created a vault in one of its secret rooms. In  1369 DR, the vault still contained Jelde's ''[[blade of destruction]]'' and a set of ''arcane mail'', with a message written by him that offered these enchanted items as aid to future explorers as their original owners no longer needed them. However, a [[dark naga]] nested in the adjacent room to the hidden vault making it dangerous to access."
