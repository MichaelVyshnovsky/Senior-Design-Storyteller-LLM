The Wyrmcrown was a powerful dragon artifact.
The Wyrmcrown allowed its bearer to magically poison any dragon who was blood-related to it, or a dragon whose blood the bearer had tasted. The Wyrmcrown could affect any dragon within the continent of Laerakond.
As of 1479 DR, the Wyrmcrown was in the possession of the Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal.
