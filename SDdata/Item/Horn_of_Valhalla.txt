A '''Horn of Valhalla''' was a wondrous item that had the power to summon forth the [[spirit]]s of [[barbarian]]s from the [[afterlife]] to fight for the summoner. 

==Description==
The horns came in five ''Ivory horns of Valhalla'' pressed three charges, each summoned an [[ivory shieldmaiden]] [[construct]] to aid the horn's owner in battle.

==History==
Sometime long before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, a [[bard]]-specific ''Horn of Valhalla'' was created by the respected [[Reghedmen]] bard, [[Beogin]], whose songs were sang across many of the northern barbarian tribes. The bard took his ''Horn of Valhalla'' into many gran d battles of his tribe. Beogin was ordered by his chieftain to blow the horn were he ever in grave danger, however the bard's pride kept him from doing so as he died in battle with the horn hidden under his fur [[cloak]].

Another variety, an ''ivory horn of Valhalla'', was created by the powerful [[bard]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] named [[Falataer]]. The original horn was used to test his students and reward them when appropriate. With years passing, ''ivory horns of Valhalla'' were copied and imitated.

Years later, Beogin's ''Bardic Horn of Valhalla'' ended up in possession of [[Gerth]], a trader proprietor of ''[[Gerth's Equipment Shoppe]]'' of [[Kuldahar]] and a collector of ancient missilery.

''Circa'' [[1368 DR]], the traveling merchant and instrument-maker [[Maheer yn Kadar el Saddith]] was capable of "upgrading" a ''horn of Valhalla'' to the version of next higher potency.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the world of [[Toril]] traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|2}} While traveling in [[Asgard]], they stopped at the hall of [[Gloamingard]] at the same time as the [[Seelie Court]] was visiting. Queen [[Titania]], desiring some entertainment,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|25-26}} challenged the adventurers to a series of friendly competitions against her [[fey]] entourage. For their trouble she offered as prizes an ''[[ice sapphire]]'', a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', and a ''horn of Valhalla''<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|27}} made of iron that she referred to as ''Tyjar's horn''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|27,36}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well/Certificates}}
