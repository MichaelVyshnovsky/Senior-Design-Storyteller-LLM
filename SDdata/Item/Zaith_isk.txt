A '''zaith'isk''' was a device used by the [[githyanki]] to treat [[ceremorphosis]].

{{quote|''The zaith'isk. Vlaakith's purity, distilled. My duty. My right.''|[[Lae'zel]]}}

==Description==
A zaith'isk was a partly organic, partly mechanical githyanki device that was an ingenious synthesis of [[illithid]] anatomy and metal alloys. It hummed with [[psionic]] energy, hinting at paths into unknown minds and unseen [[planes]].

It purportedly purified a mind flayer tadpole from an infected victim. When activated, psionic forces battered the victim. The device targeted the tadpole but its approach was haphazard. Without precise control, it could inflict lasting harm on the victim's mental faculties.

However, the device's curative properties were a lie fed to the githyanki. In truth, the device was lethal and its purpose was to harvest the mind and memory of the infected githyanki, and ending their lives.

==Usage==
Ghustil [[Stornugoss]], a githyanki scholar and physician, operated a zaith'isk in [[Cr√®che Y'llek]].
