Although it made the ship faster in combat, it became more difficult to maneuver.{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}",
        "Description": "This type of ''[[figurehead of wondrous power]]'' was a [[humanoid]] figure carved from [[beech]]. The eyes were beset with two glittering [[emerald]]s.",
        "Powers": "Although this statue increased the tactical speed of a [[spelljammer]], it did not increase its travel speed. It could be used for one hour per week. Once this time was reached, its powers were unusable for a few days."
