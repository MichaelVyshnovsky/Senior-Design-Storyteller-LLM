Nelvine, also known as pigeon stone, was the Realms name for a variety of feldspar called albite which was found in large quantities in older rock formations.
The gem quality version of these ornamental stones had a blue iridescent flash known as peristerism.
Nelvine was used as a component in spells that disguised a person or object without changing the targets true nature. It was also powdered for the magical ink to inscribe such spells on scrolls.
