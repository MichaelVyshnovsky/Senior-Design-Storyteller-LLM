{{wikipedia article|Albite}}
'''Nelvine''', also known as '''pigeon stone''', was the Realms name for a variety of [[feldspar]] called [[wikipedia:en:albite|albite]] which was found in large quantities in older rock formations.

==Description==
The [[gem]] quality version of these [[ornamental stones]] had a blue iridescent flash known as ''peristerism''.

==Powers==
Nelvine was used as a component in spells that disguised a person or object without changing the target's true nature. It was also powdered for the magical [[ink]] to inscribe such spells on scrolls.
