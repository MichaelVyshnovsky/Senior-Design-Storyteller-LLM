'''''Maps of location''''' were [[enchanted]] [[map]]s that were invaluable for naval vessel navigation and [[Aglarond]]an military commanders.

==Description==
Each ''map of location'' appeared to be a simple rolled-up sheet of [[parchment]].

==Powers==
''Maps of location'' were used at sea. Once such an item was unrolled, it showed a naval map of the region relative to the user's location. The map owner's ship was marked with a moving icon on the map.

==Notable Owners==
*[[The Simbul]], or the feared "[[hedge wizard]]" queen of Aglarond, was the supposed inventor of the ''maps of location''. She created a number of these maps to be used by the country's navy commanders sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[High Autharch]] [[Blaze Mythalanir]] of [[Thay]] owned a ''map of location'', kept in his private cargo aboard the ''[[Bounty (ship)|Bounty]]''. It was later presented as payment to [[adventurer]]s of [[Ravens Bluff]] who'd been tasked with escorting Mythalanir from the Living City to [[Bezantur]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
