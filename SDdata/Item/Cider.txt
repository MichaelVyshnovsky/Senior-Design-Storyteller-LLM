'''Ciders''' were a type of alcoholic drink, widely produced and consumed in the [[Realms]].

==Description==
[[File:Apple Cider.png|thumb|200px|''A mug of apple cider.'']]
Ciders were fermented from various fruits, either on their own or combined to make particular flavors. [[Apple]]s were extremely common, but other fruits used included [[cherries]], [[plum]]s, [[blueberries]], [[pear]]s, [[quince]]s, and [[gooseberries]], with the final appearance and alcoholic strength of the drink varying significantly based on the recipe.

==Availability==
The sparkling variety of apple cider was pressed by the [[dwarves]] and found sold in the town of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Notable Ciders==
* [[Elfsong Cider]], a fruity but flat cider named after a tavern in [[Baldur's Gate]].
* ''[[Hell's Teeth Cider]]'', an [[enchanted]] variety of cider from the [[Yawning Portal]].{{Cite adventurers league/Last Orders at the Yawning Portal|63}}
