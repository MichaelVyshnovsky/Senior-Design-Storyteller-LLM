A '''''minyan''''' (or '''''minyarn'''''

==Description==
Even though it was a small shrine, a ''minyan'' was still quite large, being some {{SIrange|10|20|ft|long=yes}} in length. Similar to a [[palanquin]], it was mounted on poles carried by bearers. They were heavy enough that twenty men were needed to lift and transport them. ''Minyans'' could contained holy texts or the remains of important figures in the faith.

==Uses==
In [[Kara-Tur]], many [[monasteries]] and temples possessed their own ''minyans''. These were overseen and maintained by the senior priest or a chosen underling; such a person must have morals matching their faith. They were carried by groups of [[sohei]], whether into battle or in processions through communities.

As a ''minyan'' represented its deity, it required veneration in a like manner. Each day, [[incense]] and offerings must be placed before it and a [[shukenja]] of the religion must perform services. Moreover, on holy days, the ''minyan'' must be paraded through the streets outside for all to witness and respect the deity. If these duties were not kept up, then the ''minyan'' lost its magical power forever.

==Powers==
Empowered by its deity, a ''minyan'' had several magical powers to bestow on those of the faith, and on those against it. It could be used to [[remove curse|remove a curse]] on allies thrice a day or lay an [[ancient curse]] on foes once a month. In battle, it bolstered the morale of allied sohei who could see it, while causing fear in those of opposing ethos who approached within {{SI|30|yard|long=yes}}, who might flee in panic for a minute. Finally, it could [[heal]] someone to full health once every seven days.

==Notable ''Minyans''==
The [[Blue Stork monastery]] of the [[Path of Enlightenment]] in [[Shou Lung]] had a ''minyarn'' of an altar holding holy texts and its founder's remains. When this ''minyarn'' was stolen by bandits, the sohei [[Shyarn Feng]] was charged with recovering it, but the effort cost the lives of all his team and the ''minyarn''s power was lost.

The [[Floating Cloud School]] of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Kozakura]] contained [[Zezen Ito]]'s "Great Interpretation of the Way of Enlightenment".

The [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Wa]] had a very large ''minyan'' that needed thirty [[pilgrim]]s to carry it. It was paraded through the town of [[Aru]] in the [[Ceremony of the Three Thousand]] steps.
