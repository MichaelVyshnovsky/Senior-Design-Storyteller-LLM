'''''Onglore's amulet of war''''' was a divinely blessed piece of magical jewelry that belonged to [[Onglore]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] lord of ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
''Onglore's amulet of war'' was a locket decorated with the symbol of [[Haela Brightaxe]], the deity who blessed the item. ''Onglore's amulet'' was made of [[gold]] and glowed with Haela's radiance.

==Powers==
''Onglore's amulet of war'' possessed a simple enchantment that enchanted the wearer's constitution and strength.

==History==
The dwarven lord Onglore was a devotee of Haela Brightaxe, the Lady of the Fray, and for his valor and bravery in battle, he received a blessed divine ''amulet of war''. He cherished the locket that accompanied him into countless battles. Onglore met his demise in the {{YearlinkName|714}} during the [[Weeping War]] that brought down the City of Song. He was interred along with his amulet within a crypt in the Main Halls of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] underneath Myth Drannor.

By [[1369 DR]], Onglore was returned to a semblance of life as a ravenous [[ghast]], still guarding his ''amulet of war''. The item came to be owned by the [[Veiled Ones]] who slew the restless dwarven lord. During the same time, a [[dark naga]] [[Preybelish]] sought for unique magical [[amulet]]s in the dungeons; ''Onglore's amulet of war'' was among the items he wanted to add to his collection.
