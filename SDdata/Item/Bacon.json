        "mainbody": "Bacon was a fatty cut of pork, generally from the side of a pig or boar, eaten largely across northern and western Faer没n. Along the Sword Coast North, pieces of bacon were sometimes simply referred to as slices of boar fat. \nBacon was used in all manner of dishes, but it was particularly common to eat it for morning meals as part of a dawnfry or morningfeast. In the Western Heartlands, it was commonly served alongside toasted bread flavored with the bacon drippings, or in thick slabs garnished with fruit (such as quince) and scrambled eggs, occasionally paired with coffee. In the Dalelands, it might be accompanied by some or all of fresh milk, doves eggs, grapes, radishes, savory tarts, fried mushrooms, cheese, fried bread, tomatoes and wine. In the Lands of Intrigue, it might be served alongside pancakes and honey-molasses syrup, with eggs, or in omelets along with additions like sausage, cheese, onions, and peppers. In the Moonsea, it was eaten alongside eggs and honeycakes. In Ravens Bluff, it was eaten with eggs and occasionally with Zakharan coffee. In the Border Kingdoms, it was eaten alongside eggs, ham, toast, and fruit like apples and melons. The Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles ate bacon with goose eggs and fresh cream paired with either cake or bread, and the dwarves of the Moonshaes kept it as travel food. On the Sea of Swords, ships might stock bacon alongside breakfast steak, fried potatoes, wheat cakes, and oranges for morning meals. In the North, bacon was often served along with fried bread, accompanied with things like a wedge of cheese, dark beer, and a raw onion, or with eggs and fried fish. The dwarves of the North ate bacon with eggs, muffins, and berries.\nAside from being a morning food, bacon was an important ingredient in many other dishes and meals across dwarven, human, and even orcish cuisine. Examples included High Dale lamb (a traditional dish from Highcastle), dwarven Potato leek soup, bloodlick in the Vast (a gravy-like spread eaten on bread by farmers), and \"orc\" bacon (spiced or sweetened baked bacon strips). Bacon dishes were also popular as tavern food and in pies and hand pies, often paired with leek, kidney, or gooseberries.\nBacon generally stored and travelled well, especially when wrapped in wax paper, which perhaps contributed to it being a reliable ration among manual laborers, sailors, soldiers,\nBacon fat was used to cook vegetables like mushrooms and onions and was an important ingredient in pastry dough throughout the Eastern Heartlands. The Watchful Eye in Essembra used bacon fat in the pastry of their Stuffed Turkey Pie, and the Wight on a Waterdragon restaurant in Marsember used it to make the pastry shell of their \"sea pie\" (filled with various macerated sea creatures cooked in beef stew). Bacon fat was measured by the knife.\nIn a pinch, flaming bacon could be used as a weapon.\nWhile bacon was produced throughout north and west Faer没n, some locations product had distinct reputations, such as the town of Hlintar in the Vast, which was was famous for its high-quality bacon, or High Helm in Cormyr, known for their bacon being very salty. Outside of north and west Faer没n, bacon was eaten in the Border Kingdoms Bacon was not commonly eaten by elves to the extent that half-elves would sometimes add bacon to elven dishes as an act of rebellion.\nBacon could generally be purchased from pig farmers butchers, and provisioners.\nNotable establishments selling bacon dishes included\n* The Battlescarred Bard, an inn on the Trade Way between Proskul and Imnescar, was known for the platters of fried bacon and onions served in the wintertime, often alongside dried apricots, buttery rice, and hot bread.\n* In the town of Berdusk, bacon was served in gravy alongside gondenstars at taverns.\n* The Cutlass in Luskan served mussels wrapped in salty bacon.\n* The Fast Sails tavern in Tulmene was known to make particularly delicious bacon tarts.\n* The Goblet and Gems in Mirabar was known for its bacon twists, one of the few things on its menu.\n* The House of Pity, a meager inn about 6 days south of Elturel, served a bad breakfast of bacon grease on bread.\n* The Inn of the Dripping Dagger in Waterdeep served thick-cut bacon cooked to order (or raw, if desired) with parsley and bread rolls for 6 copper pieces.\n* On the High Moor, the Maid of the Moors restaurant in Mornbryns Shield served a fryplate consisting of bacon and fried tomatoes and mushrooms topped with almonds and buttery scrambled eggs and finished with pepper and a few drops of brandy. \n* The Moonstone Mask in Neverwinter served a hot bacon and kidney pie.\n* Mother Teshlas Turret Club for Adventurers in Waterdeep served bacon and butter sandwiches.\n* The Old Trolls Foot in Kirinwood, Cormyr served local wild board bacon flavored with strong herbs. \n* The Shepherds Rest in High Dale served a delicious dawnfry with bacon and Reddan wine.\n* The Stag Triumphant in Mosstone was known for its omelets, including ones with bacon.\n* Stargath House in Purskul was known for its \"Welcome Soup\", a creamy stew of smoked bacon, black beans, and chives garnished with mint.\n* The Whispering Maiden inn in Zazesspur served a simple breakfast of bacon, quail eggs, and spiced ale.\n* The Worried Wyvern in Hills Edge served a breakfast of toast with bacon, sausage, and drippings.\nBacon was eaten in northern Faer没n as far back as ancient Netheril.\nElminster was a fan of bacon, and enjoyed sandwiches featuring cheese and bacon heated in an Earth microwave.\nDruth, a flatfish found in the Akanamere, was said to taste like bacon.\nHighmoon Dark was a beer brewed at the Oak and Spear tavern in Highmoon which was said to have an aftertaste similar to bacon."
