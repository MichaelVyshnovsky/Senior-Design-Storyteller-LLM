Its pommel looked like a spider's head, with two dull [[emerald]]s for its eyes.\n\nIt was later merged with Drizzt's ''[[Twinkle]]'' by [[Catti-brie]] on the Great Forge in Gauntlgrym, creating a new powerful blade.",
        "Abilities": "The sword was imbued with magic by a [[djinni]]. It could defeat some magical energy.",
        "History": "The legendary weaponsmith [[Gol'fanin]] forged ''Vidrinath'' in [[Gauntlgrym]] for Tiago Baenre in [[1463 DR]]."
