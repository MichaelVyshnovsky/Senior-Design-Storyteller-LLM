'''''Scarabs of goodwill''''' were enchanted [[amulet]]s of the [[Nephthys]]an faith typically found only in [[Mulhorand]], also popular among the [[cleric]]s of [[Waukeen]].

==Powers==
''Scarabs of goodwill'', like other [[scarab]] amulets, were carved in the shape of scarab beetles. Only usable by clerics, these items were imbued with a beneficial enchantment that allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[friends]]'' spell on themselves, dramatically increasing their charisma once a day for approximately one and a half minutes.

==History==
''Scarabs of goodwill'' were created by a priest of Nephthys from [[Mulhorand]], named [[Ani Haloua]]. She created her amulet to be more effective in negotiations with the local merchants and regular folk of her town. With time, similar scarabs started appearing in [[Faerûn]] and were especially beloved by the clergy of Waukeen.

In [[1281 DR]], two of these scarabs were located in the far north of Faerûn. One was in possession of [[Orrick]] the Gray, a reclusive [[wizard]] studying ''[[mythal]]''s in [[Kuldahar]], not far from the [[Spine of the World]]. And the second one - sold by [[Quinn Silverfinger]] in the [[Golden Lodge]] temple of [[Lonelywood]], [[Ten Towns]].
