Wyvern poison was the deadly venom extracted from wyverns and commonly used throughout the East Faer√ªn.
The substance had a telltale bitter scent.
The deadly poison could be used to coat blades. Once the substance was introduced into a targets wound, it sapped their constitution, by burning through the bloodstream, collapsing veins and arteries, eventually resulting in death as the poison reached the heart.
