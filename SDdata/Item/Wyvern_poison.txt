'''Wyvern poison''' was the deadly [[poison|venom]] extracted from [[wyvern]]s and commonly used throughout the [[East Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
The substance had a telltale bitter scent.

==Powers==
The deadly poison could be used to coat blades. Once the substance was introduced into a target's wound, it sapped their constitution, by burning through the bloodstream, collapsing veins and arteries, eventually resulting in death as the poison reached the heart.

==Notable Users==
*[[Eshenesra]], a notorious [[elf|elven]] [[rogue]] and [[assassin]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Nettie]], a healer in the [[Emerald Grove]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
