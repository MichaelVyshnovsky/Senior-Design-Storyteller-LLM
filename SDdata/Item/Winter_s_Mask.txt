Winters Mask was a unique enchanted face-covering crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Shevarith Kendia in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
Silverhand crafted this mask according to Shevariths own design. It was intended to evoke the land of Rashemen.
The Mask allowed Shevarith to create a powerful wind blast to push her enemies around the battlefield.
* Shevarith Kendia, a Rashemi wizard to whom Silverhand also gifted the dagger of lasting memory and the seal of readiness.
