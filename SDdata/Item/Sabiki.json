        "mainbody": "A '''sabiki''' was a [[Kozakura]]n fishing device.",
        "Description": "A sabiki rig consisted of a set of multiple hooked lines with a single lure and sinker. It was developed by [[Kozakuran]] fishermen for catching oceanic baitfish.",
        "History": "Originating in Kozakura, the sabiki eventually found its way to [[northwest Faer√ªn]] by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], where it proved especially adept at snaring [[candlefish]] and clumps of [[marimo]]. Fishing contest organizers found its use unfair, given the amount of hooks involved."
