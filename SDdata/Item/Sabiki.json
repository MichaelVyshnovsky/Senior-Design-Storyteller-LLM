        "mainbody": "sabiki was a Kozakuran fishing device.\nA sabiki rig consisted of a set of multiple hooked lines with a single lure and sinker. It was developed by Kozakuran fishermen for catching oceanic baitfish.\nOriginating in Kozakura, the sabiki eventually found its way to northwest Faer√ªn by the 15 century DR, where it proved especially adept at snaring candlefish and clumps of marimo. Fishing contest organizers found its use unfair, given the amount of hooks involved."
