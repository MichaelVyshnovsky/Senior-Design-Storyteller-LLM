        "mainbody": "han Tien, or Lightning, was a legendary magical spear of Shou Lung history.\nOf artifact-level power, Shan Tien was a +4 spear with a number of magical powers. It could break any weapon thrice a day. It also could be used for teleportation three times a day and could heal someone to full health once a day. It was of lawful good nature.\nThe ancient Shou hero Chung Hsin Te was the first known wielder of Shan Tien. In time, he passed it on to Tan Chin, the heroic emperor of the First Kingdom of Shou Lung.\nIn Shou Year −120 (−1370 DR), Tan Chin wielded Shan Tien when he fought the Black Leopard Cult at Durkon. There, with a sweep of Shan Tien, Tan Chin cut the Ivory Chain of Pao and freed the Black Leopard, who quickly seized the corrupt high priest Nan Kung Chi and dragged him screaming into the night, giving Tan Chin victory over the remaining cult.\nHowever, when Tan Chin grew corrupted to evil, he was no longer able to wield Shan Tien. It was stored in the Library of Kuo Meilan, the imperial capital.\nWhen the First Kingdom fell and Kuo Meilan destroyed, Shan Tien was stolen and never seen again.\n* Chung Hsin Te\n* Emperor Tan Chin"
