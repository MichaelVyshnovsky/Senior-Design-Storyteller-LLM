'''Sund''' was a [[wine]] made in the village and vale of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|20-21}}

==Creation==
In Maskyr's Eye, vineyards were planted on the steep hillsides at the vale's eastern edge to avert erosion and landslides. However, the cold, damp weather caused them to be troubled by the [[blackweb]] blight and the [[grape]]s grew bitter and stunted. These were fermented to make sund.

==Description==
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the resulting wine was thin and yellow-green in hue and had a sharply sour flavor in both taste and smell, making it quite an acquired taste. Fortunately, the Maskyrians had acquired such a taste and had a small number of sund-lovers among them. Further afield, even in [[Calaunt]] it was named '''sheeprun''' after its alleged similarity to the [[goldflow]] of [[sheep]]. Nevertheless, it traveled well, so some traders and caravaneers preferred it for personal use.

==Availability==
Accordingly, a large skin of sun cost only 2 [[cp]], while a [[barrel]] big enough for a man to carry would set one back 1 [[sp]]. It was sold as a beverage at [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn in Maskyr's Vale, but otherwise there was little profit to be had in trading it.
