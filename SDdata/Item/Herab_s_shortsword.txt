'''''Herab's shortsword''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[short sword]] wielded by Captain [[Herab]] who sailed the [[Sea of Swords]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The armor possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and it offered the wielder ''vampiric regeneration'' that rejuvenated them with the enemy's spilled blood.

==History==
''Herab's shortsword'' was a typical weapon and an implement of torture used by many officers of the [[Zhentarim]]. These weapons had the ability to absorb spilled blood and transfer its healing power to the wielder. Many owners of such blades became addicted to the daily bloodletting of their prisoners and slaves. At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Captain Herab pried the sword from the hands of a dead Zhent.

Captain Herab wielded the blade during her time working for the [[Black Network]], transporting smuggled weapons and supplies of an [[orc]]ish army that menaced the city of [[Daggerford]]. She used the shortsword when faced the [[Hero of Daggerford]] and his allies in the pirate hideout of the [[Crab's Claw Coast]]. With her life likely being forfeit, the fate of ''Herab's shortsword'' was unknown after that point.
