'''Cumin''' was a flowering plant with its seeds used as [[spices|spice]] and a valuable trade commodity that could be found as far north as the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] and as far south as the scorching sands of [[Zakhara]].

==Availability==
Cumin was sold through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']], priced at two [[silver]] [[coin]]s per {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}}.

Ground powdered cumin was known to be available in [[Luskan]] and in the Ten Towns.

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], cumin grew within the [[Domains of Dread]] and was used for its protective qualities against ''[[paralyze|paralyzation]]''.{{Cite book| author =Â William W.

==Usage==
Cumin seeds were available in [[Liham]] of [[north Zakhara]] and used to flavor [[lamb ragout]].

In [[Cursrah]], [[Calimshan]], cumin-dusted [[almond]]s were a common treat.

Cumin seeds possessed some minor medicinal stimulant properties.

The spell of ''[[endurance]]'', a reversed version of ''[[fatigue]]'', used a pinch of cumin seeds or [[poison nut]] as its [[material component]].{{Cite dragon/130/Arcane Lore: Magic from East to West|17}}

Some believed that cumin seed, sprinkled in a habitat's doorway, could provide the dwelling with protection from evil.{{Cite dragon/33/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magical Oils|47}}

==History==
''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], cumin, along with other items such as [[bay leaf]] packages, [[cinnamon]], and [[Death Cheese]], were regularly exported into the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale from Luskan. One merchant who dealt in these goods was [[Boswell Peddywinkle]].

==Trivia==
In [[1492 DR]], a [[homunculus]] named [[Cumin (homunculus)|Cumin]] inhabited [[Fistandia's mansion]] and worked diligently in its aroma-filled kitchens.
