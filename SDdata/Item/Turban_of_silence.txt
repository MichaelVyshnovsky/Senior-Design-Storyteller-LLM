Turbans of silence were magical turbans that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. They were only used by holy slayers.
Three times per day the wearer of this turban could create a spherical region of silence exactly like the wizard spell silence, 15 radius. The silence could be dispelled at any time from a mental command by the wearer.
