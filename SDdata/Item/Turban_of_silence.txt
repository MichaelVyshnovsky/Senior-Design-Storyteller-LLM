'''''Turbans of silence''''' were [[magical item|magical]] [[turban]]s that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. They were only used by [[holy slayer]]s.

==Powers==
Three times per day the wearer of this turban could create a spherical region of silence exactly like the [[wizard]] [[spell]] ''[[silence, 15' radius]]''. The silence could be dispelled at any time from a mental command by the wearer.
