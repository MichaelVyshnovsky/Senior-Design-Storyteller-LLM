        "mainbody": "Iron bands of Bilarro were magic shackles that were capable of restraining creatures up to the size of giants.\nWhen not in use, the iron bands of Bilarro took the shape of a small rusty iron sphere 3 in (7.6 cm) in diameter. When deployed, they opened into a series of metal straps that tangled around their intended target.\nThe user activated the iron bands of Bilarro by speaking a command word and throwing the sphere at the desired target. On a successful hit, the bands were deployed and entrapped the target. Once in place, a sufficiently strong individual could in principle break free and destroy the iron bands through sheer strength, but only with great difficulty.\nThe bands could be deployed once per day and recovered their power at dawn.\nIn 1492 DR, a set of iron bands of Bilarro was used to hold Ott Steeltoes, an operative of the Xanathars Thieves Guild, by members of Bregan Daerthe."
