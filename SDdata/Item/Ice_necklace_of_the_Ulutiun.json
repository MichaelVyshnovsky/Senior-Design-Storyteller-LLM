        "mainbody": "An '''''ice necklace of the Ulutiun''''' was a type of [[magic item|magic]] necklace that originated from the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "Each necklace was made up of six acorn-sized ice crystals that had been magically hardened and preserved. Two of these crystals were opaque, while the other four were transparent.",
        "Powers": "When one of these crystals was detached and thrown by the wearer at a distance of {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} or less, the crystal would explode upon reaching the end of its trajectory and unleash one of two [[spell]] effects depending upon the type of crystal. The opaque crystals would unleash an effect similar to the spell ''[[sleet storm]]'', while the transparent crystals caused an effect similar to the spell ''[[ice storm]]''.",
        "History": "These necklaces were said to have been created by a half-mad [[sorcerer]] that wandered among the [[Ulutiun]] tribes of the Great Glacier."
