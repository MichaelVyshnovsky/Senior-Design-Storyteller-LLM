        "mainbody": "A robe of cold resistance was a type of enchanted robe common among wizards throughout the Sword Coast region. It was more common in the northern reaches of the region, in places such as Icewind Dale and Neverwinter.\nThese robes were largely white, with some yellow flourishings around the chest and shoulders.\nWhoever wore one of these robes was imbued with a minor resistance to harm from severe cold.\nYoung mages in the Sword Coast region would often receive one of these robes as a gift from their instructor for completing their first five years of study."
