A '''''dweomered door''''' was a term used to describe one of many types of magical doorways.

==Description==
These doors often came in odd shapes and sizes, and were masterfully crafted from exotic woods and materials. Other times a ''dweomered door'' was simple and plain in appearance, perhaps to disguise the treasures that were found behind.

==Use==
''Dweomered doors'' were often used as a deterrent against potential thieves from reaching treasure caches or other valuables. On the other hand, they could simply be placed as a punishment for overly curious explorers. For example, the ''[[animating door]]'' would [[animate dead|animate]] any corpse that was brought through its threshold, while the ''[[door of beasts]]'', when opened, would burst open and release several monsters.

These unique passageways often, especially in the former instance, had additional locks and traps, both mechanical and [[magic]]al attached to them.

These magical doors were widely used in the [[South Faerûn|Shining South]], especially [[Halruaa]] where they were often installed in [[wizard]] sanctums.
