'''''Rings of power''''' were pieces of protective [[enchanted]] jewelry that gained popularity in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] across the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Powers==
These enchanted [[ring]] were created of two types: regular ''rings of power'' and ''lesser rings of power''. The lesser variation simply granted the wearer magical defenses against cold, electricity, and fire harm as well as the powers of ''[[regeneration]]''. Regular ''rings of power'' granted significantly more potent magical defenses, ''regeneration'', and gave the wearer the boon of ''[[freedom]]''.

==History==
Originally, ''rings of power'' created on the behest of [[Mynseril Lostbone]] a powerful [[Malar]]ite priest. He cherished blood-soaked brawls and wanted to find a way to prolong the ferocious pleasure. Mynseril started studying [[troll]]s and their uncanny regenerative powers, eventually coming up with the idea to outfit the most savage warriors with regenerative magics. Mynseril Lostbone commissioned the creation of ''rings of power'' and routinely gifted them to the strongest warriors from opposing factions who were to meet on the battlefield against each other.

In [[1372 DR]], regular and ''lesser rings of power'' were available for purchase in the Temple of [[Tyr]] of [[Port Llast]], from cleric named [[Neurik]] and later in [[Beorunna's Well]]. The same year, [[Oleff Uskar]] of the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Neverwinter]] offered these rings to his allies in the war with [[Luskan]].

''Circa'' 1372 DR, several powerful magical items were brought to [[Toril]] by a planeswalking [[wizard]] [[Vejoni H. Wyzz]] who pitched his extraplanar tent just outside the town of [[Liam's Hold]]. ''Lesser rings of power'' could be found in his collection.
