A '''thelarr''' was a simple wind instrument cut from a reed. It was considered a rustic [[longhorn]].

==Description==
Thelarrs made a characteristic buzzing sound due to the dry fibers inside them. They were very simple instruments to construct, so that skilled [[bard]]s made them to give away to children.

If purchased through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', they could be obtained individually or as complete sets that could be played together to form melodies and chords.
