'''Dwarfbane''' was a [[poison]] that was especially effective against [[dwarves]].

==Description==
Dwarfbane was gummy in its consistency.

==Uses==
The [[duergar]] of the [[Underdark]] often coated [[dart]]s and other weapons with this poison for the use in traps.

==History==
Though the duergar were completely immune to the poison, dwarfbane was lethal to all other dwarves.

Dwafbane was one of sixteen formulas for poisons recorded in the book known as ''[[The Nathlum]]''. It was thought that the formulas were originally written down by the [[mage]], [[Lethchauntos the Black]], during his time spent with an [[orc]] tribe. Some of these same formulas were copied from the book by the mage, [[Phrandjas]] of [[Port Llast]] and sold to local [[alchemist]]s.
