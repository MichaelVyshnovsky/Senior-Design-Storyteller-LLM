        "Powers": "This unassuming-looking ring had tiny barbs that nicked the wearer when they were injured, as if encouraging them to flee for their lives. This [[enchantment]] was called ''frantic urgency''â€”it boosted the wearer's speed when they sustained significant injuries.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''spurred band'' was found among the bones of its previous owner in the caverns underneath the ruined town of [[Moonhaven]] that were connected to the dreaded [[Undermountain]]."
