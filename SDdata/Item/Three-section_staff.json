        "mainbody": "Three-section staves, also known as three-piece rods, were a type of Kara-Turan martial arts melee weapon. Some considered it to be a member of the flail family of weapons, due to having similar origins.Encyclopedia Magica Volume II states that this can be considered a type of flail weapon, but on page 32 of The Complete Ninjas Handbook they are listed in a separate group of weapons from flails.\nA three-section staff was composed of three sections of hard wood that were of equal length, typically measuring around  in length. These sections were connected at their ends by either chain, leather, or rope.\nA three-section staff required two hands to use. The weapon was considered useless in the hands of those who werent properly trained in its use. They could be used to strike at an opponent, block their attacks, or to catch and break an opponents weapon.\nMuch like how the threshing flail later developed into the flail, and nunchaku were developed from them.In a portion of \"Marshalling the Martial Arts\" mentioning how agricultural tools became weapons, it states that the \"grain flail became the nunchaku.\" However, since the threshing flail is more of a Western weapon it can be assumed that the \"grain flail\" referred to is the three-section staff as its design is more similar.\n* Three-section staves were a commonly utilized weapon among monks.\n* Ninjas were known to utilize three-section staves.\n* Shugenja were known to utilize three-section staves.\n* The aging shugenja Ce-ishi was proficient in the use of three-piece rods.\n* The shugenja adventurer To Fang Jio was known to wield a three-piece rod and was considered to be quite deadly with it."
