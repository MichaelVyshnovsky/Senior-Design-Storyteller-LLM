        "mainbody": "'''Three-section staves''', also known as '''three-piece rods''', were a type of [[Kara-Tur]]an martial arts melee weapon. Some considered it to be a member of the [[flail]] family of weapons, due to having similar origins.''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume II]]'' states that this can be considered a type of flail weapon, but on page 32 of ''[[The Complete Ninja's Handbook]]'' they are listed in a separate group of weapons from flails.",
        "Description": "A three-section staff was composed of three sections of hard wood that were of equal length, typically measuring around {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} in length. These sections were connected at their ends by either chain, leather, or [[rope]].",
        "Weaponology": "A three-section staff required two hands to use. The weapon was considered useless in the hands of those who weren't properly trained in its use. They could be used to strike at an opponent, block their attacks, or to catch and break an opponent's weapon.",
        "History": "Much like how the [[threshing flail]] later developed into the flail, and [[nunchaku]] were developed from them.{{Cite dragon/122/Marshalling the Martial Arts|47}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"development\">In a portion of \"Marshalling the Martial Arts\" mentioning how agricultural tools became weapons, it states that the \"grain flail became the nunchaku.\" However, since the threshing flail is more of a Western weapon it can be assumed that the \"grain flail\" referred to is the three-section staff as its design is more similar.",
        "Notable Users": {
            "Classes": "* Three-section staves were a commonly utilized weapon among [[monk]]s.\n* [[Ninja]]s were known to utilize three-section staves.\n* [[Shugenja]] were known to utilize three-section staves.",
            "Individuals": "* The aging shugenja [[Ce-ishi]] was proficient in the use of three-piece rods.\n* The shugenja adventurer [[T'o Fang Jio]] was known to wield a three-piece rod and was considered to be quite deadly with it."
