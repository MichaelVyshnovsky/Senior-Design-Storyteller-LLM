        "Description": "This ''+3 [[medium shield]]'' was forged entirely from [[mithral]]<ref group=\"note\">[[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|''Lands of Intrigue: Erlkazar and Folk of Intrigue'']] states the shield was \"made entirely of [[adamantine]] or mithral\". save for the outer rim of riveted [[silver]]. Inset within the \"top\" of the shield was an eye of crystal, also rimmed with silver.",
        "Powers": "The shield reflected the eye beams of [[beholder]]s and their kin, save for the ''[[antimagic]]'' beams that emanated from their central eyes. When the wielder of the shield looked through its crystal eye, he was protected from the gaze of [[basilisk]]s, [[catoblepases]] and [[medusa]]s. Its natural reflective properties could even reflect the gaze of these creatures back onto themselves.\n\nThree times per day, the bearer of the shield could gaze into the crystal eye and open up communication with the wielder of the ''Eye of Zahyra''.",
        "History": "[[File:Silvam versus beholder.png|thumb|right|280px|''King [[Silvam Ithal]] using the ''Shield of Silvam'' in battle against a [[beholder]].'']]\nThe shield was created before the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]] by First Vizera [[Zahyra Ithal]] and her mentor and gifted to the king before he set off with his armies. The shield contributed to Vizera Zahyra's efforts to observe and record the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]] from afar. It even inspired the formation of the [[Knights of the Shield]] in the year [[-170 DR|âˆ’170 DR]]. After the wars, it was stored within the Tethyrian royal vaults but eventually went missing some time during the [[Strohm Dynasty]].\n\nThe artifact was recovered some time before the [[Reclamation Wars]], and was given to [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Prince Haedrak]] prior to his meeting with [[Zaranda Star]] in [[Uktar]] of [[1368 DR]]."
