Enduring vestments were enchanted protective wizardly robes used by members of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan in the late 14 century DR.
Enduring vestments possessed a simple +1 protective enchantment and granted the wearer resistance to spells. Additionally, the wearer could cast the false life spell once per day.
Some time before the , the first set of enduring vestments were created by a wizard of the Host Tower of the Arcane named Nimreth Aragodar after almost losing her life at the claws of one of the creatures the wizard experimented on. Even though the created mages garb protected her from spells and physical harm, it did not save Nimreth when a summoned water elemental filled her lungs with water.
In 1374 DR, a  robe of enduring vestments was worn by an appraise of the Arcane Brotherhood who operated out of the Brotherhoods spy outpost north of Neverwinter.
