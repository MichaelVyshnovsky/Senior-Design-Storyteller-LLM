'''''Gloomstrand shields''''' were [[enchanted]] [[shield]]s that were said to originate from [[Gloomwrought]] in the [[Shadowfell]].

==Powers==
''Gloomstrand shields'' were believed to be created from the Prince of Gloomwrought's locks of hair. Through this, the shields were connected to the Shadowfell and allowed the wielder to be more stealthy and blend in with shadows more easily.

==History==
A ''Gloomstrand shield'' was left within an old tollhouse in the town of [[Reithwin]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], surrounded by an ancient decaying battlefield where a force of [[Harpers]] clashed with the [[Dark Justiciars]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
