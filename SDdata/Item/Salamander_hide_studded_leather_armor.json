        "mainbody": "Salamander hide studded leather armor was a common type of enchanted studded leather armor as of the late 14 century DR.\nThese sets of armor were crafted using the hides of salamanders, lizard-like beings native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Armorers used the material due to its magical nature, toughness, and malleability greater than that of dragonhide.\nSalamander hide studded leather armor possessed a simple defensive +1 enchantment and offered the wearer resistance to fire. Additionally, items made out of salamander hide were significantly lighter than other items of the type."
