        "mainbody": "The '''''Lens of Oghma''''', part of the ''Fading Rings'' set, was a unique enchanted [[ring]] that bore the name of [[Oghma]], the Lord of Knowledge.",
        "Description": "The ''Lens of Oghma'' was a signet ring decorated with two [[gem]]s of chilling blue color, resembling a pair of eyes.",
        "Powers": "This ring was only usable by [[sorcerer]]s and possessed the power to cast the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell. Additionally, it enhanced the wearer's chances of hitting their target with a spell or a weapon, similarly to a ''+4'' enchantment.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Lens of Oghma'' was possessed by ''the Great Stone Head'', a monument in [[Myth Drannor]]'s the [[Nightingale Court]]. In exchange for one of the ''[[eidolon]]s'', small totemic statues depicting various gods, the monument dispensed powerful magic ''Fading Rings''. This ring was one of the set depicting the cold eyes of Oghma and gave the wearer the gift of true sight."
