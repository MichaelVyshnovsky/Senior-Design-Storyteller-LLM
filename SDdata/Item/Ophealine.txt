'''Ophealine''' ({{Pronounce|oh|FEE|leen|refs={{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|16}}}}), or more commonly '''glass stone''', was the name in the Realms for [[wikipedia:axinite|axinite]]. The purple or violet variety was called '''yanolite'''.

==Description==
Ophealine occurred in large crystals that yielded faceted gemstones of impressive size, and was hard enough to be used in jewelry, especially rings, that were subject to the wear and tear of everyday use. The typical brown hue was so intense that bigger crystals looked opaque.

The purple yanolite was considered sacred by followers of [[Ghaunadaur]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}
 
==Powers==
Ophealine had an anti-magic quality such that it could not be used as a material component in any spell, potion, [[ink]] or other magical preparation&mdash;the magic always failed. When worn as an ornament, ophealine prevented ''[[hold person]]'' spells and all manner of magical paralyzing effects from being effective.
