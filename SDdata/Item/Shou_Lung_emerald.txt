Shou Lung emeralds, known as the bureaucrats stone in Kara-Tur, had a rich color and were highly valued in western Faer√ªn. A legend surrounding these stones held that there were only three of them in existence, but this was clearly a myth as there were at least a dozen known stockpiles of them in various locations around the West.
Shou Lung emeralds were similar to western emeralds but were much harder and had a more lustrous polish. A typical specimen had a base value of 5,000 gp.
If this stone had powers, they have not been documented.
