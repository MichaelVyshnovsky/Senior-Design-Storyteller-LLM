        "mainbody": "Annasker was a type of ale, or \"small beer,\" named after the family who produced it and renowned for its refreshing taste throughout the Sword Coast in the late 15 century DR.\nAnnasker was a lightly pink-colored sparkling ale. It tasted refreshingly sweet yet tart, somewhat similar to the taste of lemonade mixed with berry juice.\nAnnasker was popular among merchants and traders for its ease of transportation. Because of that, annasker was found commonly on the Sword Coast, all along the Trade Way, as far north as the city of Luskan."
