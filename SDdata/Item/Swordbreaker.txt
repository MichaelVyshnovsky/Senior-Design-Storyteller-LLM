'''Swordbreaker''' weapons, also known as '''clabbards''', were serrated [[sword]]s that varied in size, from [[dagger]] or sunder opponents' blades and [[shield]]s.

==Description==
Swordbreakers' many shapes could also have several types of serrations on on side of the blades. Greatsword swordbreakers possessed serrated edges that resembled a saw, ripping and sawing through wood and leather with effortless savagery. 

Longsword swordbreakers were medium-sized weapons with thicker and deeper metal teeth on one side of the blade. They were usually forged out of tempered [[steel]] and were used in dueling and gladiatorial battles.{{Cite dragon/303/Glory and Triumph|32}}

Knife, or dagger swordbreakers were short, wide, and heavy noted blades, sometimes dual-wielded. Same could be said about short sword swordbreakers. They were wielded in off-hand and used to patty and trap opponents' blades in  between the tines.

==Availability==
*Swordbreaker knives were in use in [[Selgaunt]], [[Sembia]].
*Short sword swordbreakers were in use in the [[Blade Kingdoms]], notably in the city-states of [[Colletro]] and [[Sumbria]]. They saw use in dueling as an off-hand weapon.

==Notable Users==
*[[Gilberto Ilégo]]: the [[Blade Captain]] from Colletro, the Blade Kingdoms ''circa'' [[1217 DR]].
*[[Vox]]: the personal guard of [[Thamalon Uskevren II]], nobleman from [[Selgaunt]], [[Sembia]] ''circa'' [[1373 DR]], who dual-wielded his swordbreaker knives in close combat with masterful finesse.
