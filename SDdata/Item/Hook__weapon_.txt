Haman, better known for his nickname, "the Shadow," was a feared assassin in service of the Night Masks. He was well known ho wielding his two blades, Hook and dagger called Skinner, to strike down his targets and disappear back into the shadows. Reportedly, he was also a capable duelist. Hamans favorite battle stance was with Hook in his right hand and the dagger in the left. The rapier guided his opponents into Skinners range to meet their demise.
In 1374 DR, Haman worked for the corrupt owner of the Track in Westgate. The Shadow protected Mordecai with his Hook and Skinner while representing the Night Masks and dealing with the businessman.
