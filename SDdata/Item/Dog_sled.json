        "Description": "For swift transportation across the snowy plains of the Great Glacier, the dog sled offered the easiest and most efficient means of travel. This sled featured a sturdy framework crafted from wood or bone, designed to carry goods and supplies. It was equipped with a small wooden platform at one end for a person to stand on, while the other end featured a wooden lattice for attaching the dog team. The sled was fitted with runners made of wood or bone, coated with blubber for smooth gliding. Typical dimensions ranged from {{SIrange|8|12|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} in width. A team of six to ten dogs exhibited remarkable strength, effortlessly pulling loads of up to {{SI|1000|lb|k|long=yes}}.",
