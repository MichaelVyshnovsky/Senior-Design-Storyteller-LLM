The Bloodaxe was an enchanted battleaxe that was the personal weapon of the First Axe of Ruathym, Rhaumon Bloodaxe.
This powerful axe had a +3 enchantment. Its companion shield was the Redshield.
Circa 1358 DR, several undead beings, such as wights, spectres, and wraiths, watched over the final resting place of the First Axe of Ruathym, Rhaumon Bloodaxe. Patrolling the mansion to the northwest of Ruathym, they would attack intruders on sight, making it difficult for anyone to access the magical axe and shield that lay there.
