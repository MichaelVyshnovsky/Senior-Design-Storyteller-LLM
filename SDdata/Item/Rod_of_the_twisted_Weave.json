        "mainbody": "he rod of the twisted Weave was an item with properties similar to a rod of absorption except instead of storing spell energy it released it as a backlash of negative energy.\nA rod of the twisted Weave was a long scepter that tapered to a point at one end made of a black-colored material. The other end of the rod was constructed with intricate strands that had been woven loosely together. Nestled amid this basket of strands was a plume of pale green raw magical energy.\nSimilar to a rod of absorption, the rod of the twisted Weave could absorb incoming spells and spell-like abilities that targeted the wielder or the wielders possessions. However, unlike a rod of absorption, the rod of the twisted Weave did not store spell energy for later use. Instead it immediately released is as a backlash of negative energy that targeted the original caster of the spell.\nFurthermore, certain spells, like negative energy protection, could ward an individual against the negative energy backlash and undead spellcasters were even healed by this effect.\nIn 1372 DR, Irae Tsarran made use of this item to great effect during the Silence of Lolth in Maerimydra.\n* Irae Tsarran"
