        "mainbody": "The '''''rod of the twisted Weave''''' was an item with properties similar to a ''[[rod of absorption]]'' except instead of storing [[spell]] energy it released it as a backlash of [[negative energy]].",
        "Description": "A ''rod of the twisted Weave'' was a long scepter that tapered to a point at one end made of a black-colored material. The other end of the rod was constructed with intricate strands that had been woven loosely together. Nestled amid this basket of strands was a plume of pale green raw magical energy.",
        "Powers": "Similar to a ''[[rod of absorption]]'', the ''rod of the twisted Weave'' could absorb incoming spells and spell-like abilities that targeted the wielder or the wielder's possessions. However, unlike a ''rod of absorption'', the ''rod of the twisted Weave'' did not store spell energy for later use. Instead it immediately released is as a backlash of [[Negative Energy Plane|negative energy]] that targeted the original caster of the spell.\n\nFurthermore, certain spells, like ''[[negative energy protection]]'', could ward an individual against the negative energy backlash and [[undead]] spellcasters were even healed by this effect.",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], [[Irae T'sarran]] made use of this item to great effect during the [[Silence of Lolth]] in [[Maerimydra]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Irae T'sarran]]"
