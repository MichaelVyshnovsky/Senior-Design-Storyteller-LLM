        "mainbody": "The Fist of the Gloomfrost was a powerful enchanted mace, forged from the black ice of Gloomfrost glacier in Icewind Dale.\nEven though forged out of strange black ice, the Fist of the Gloomfrost was only slightly cold to the touch, remaining unbelting even in the hottest flames.\nApart from having a powerful +5 enchantment, the Fist of the Gloomfrost granted the wielder minor resistance to fire and cold. Upon a successful strike, the Fist had a chance of dramatically increasing crushing damage dealt to its target. On top of that, this black ice mace allowed the wielder to activate its storm shell ability once a day, granting them resistance to fire, cold, and lightning for ten minutes.\nThe Fist of the Gloomfrost was forged in 1281 DR by a blind dwarven smith who inhabited the icy depths of Gloomfrost in Icewind Dale. Blinded by the Seer, Tiernon Denthelms hands were guided by the hands of the heroes of Ten Towns in a long process of shaping the magical black ice of Gloomfrost into this enchanted mace."
