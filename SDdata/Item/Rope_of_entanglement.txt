Ropes of entanglement were enchanted ropes used to restrain creatures.
Ropes of entanglement appeared to be ordinary hempen ropes,  long and weighted between  and .
When a user of a rope uttered the items command word while holding to its end, the rope of entanglement flew forward to entangle a single visible creature within  from the wielder. The target could avoid being restrained with quick enough reflexes, and if restrained, a strong creature could break free. If a rope sustained significant damage, it was destroyed.
Ropes of entanglement had several variations. Most differed in length, while others were unbreakable by her strength and could only be damaged by edged weapons. Longer variants or when used on smaller creatures, the ropes could entangle multiple targets.
When a  rope of entanglement was brought within  of a Methilds harp being played, its magics released any creatures restrained by the rope.
Ropes of entanglement could be created by capable crafters of wondrous items with the use of animate objects, animate rope, and entangle spells.
Among the baatezu, erinyes carried ropes of entanglement to be used in battle.
Deity Khurgorbaeyag, a lieutenant of Maglubiyet, carried a  whip enchanted with magics of a rope of entanglement in his avatar form.
