'''''Ropes of entanglement''''' were [[enchanted]] ropes used to restrain creatures.

==Description==
''Ropes of entanglement'' appeared to be ordinary [[hemp]]en ropes, {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} long and weighted between {{SI|3|lb|k|long=yes}} and {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Powers==
When a user of a ''rope'' uttered the item's command word while holding to its end, the ''rope of entanglement'' flew forward to entangle a single visible creature within {{SI|20'|'"|long=yes}} from the wielder. The target could avoid being restrained with quick enough reflexes, and if restrained, a strong creature could break free. If a ''rope'' sustained significant damage, it was destroyed.

''Ropes of entanglement'' had several variations. Most differed in length, while others were unbreakable by her strength and could only be damaged by edged weapons. Longer variants or when used on smaller creatures, the ''ropes'' could entangle multiple targets.

When a  ''rope of entanglement'' was brought within {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} of a ''[[Methild's harp]]'' being played, its magics released any creatures restrained by the ''rope''.

===Creation===
''Ropes of entanglement'' could be created by capable crafters of wondrous items with the use of ''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[animate rope]]'', and ''[[entangle]]'' [[spell]]s.

==Reputation==
Among the [[baatezu]], [[erinyes]] carried ''ropes of entanglement'' to be used in battle.

Deity [[Khurgorbaeyag]], a lieutenant of [[Maglubiyet]], carried a {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} [[whip]] enchanted with magics of a ''rope of entanglement'' in his avatar form.
