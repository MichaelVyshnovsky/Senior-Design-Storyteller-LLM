        "mainbody": "The '''Sleeping Dragon''' was an unusual [[artifact]] that floated over a permanently barren spot in the center of the [[Dragon Wood]], deep in the [[Evermoors]] of [[northwest Faer√ªn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|88}}",
        "Description": {
            "The Wink": "[[File:SleepingDragon-Wink.png|thumb|right|250px|''Cut-away view of the Wink's open hatch and compartment with a chest and some potion vials.'']]\nThe Wink was located on top of the Sleeping Dragon and required sliding the curved panel in a certain direction until a catch released  it with a click. (The direction of \"up and to the right\" was only meaningful once the compartment was opened, since it was relative to the orientation of objects inside.) Once released, the hatch swung open to reveal a rounded hollow about {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} wide, {{SI|1.5|ft|long=yes}} tall, and {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} deep. If not recently plundered, the cavity was mostly filled with a chest that could be removed by pulling on one of the large carrying handles.{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|89}} Above the chest was a stone crossbar that had ten cylindrical compartments for holding [[potion]] [[vial]]s.\n\nThe chest appeared newly made of solid [[Duskwood (tree)|duskwood]] and the seams were treated with [[tar]] to prevent moisture seepage. The corners and lid were bound with [[rivet]]ed [[iron]] bands, and there were two handles for easy portage. The chest had three [[lock]]s of a claw design, and the keys were usually found in the locks. A wide variety of things were found in the chest over the years. Examples included:{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|91}}\n* Three coils of hemp [[rope]].\n* Dry duskwood kindling.\n* Two dozen [[baldric]]s, belts, and [[scabbard]]s.\n* A half-dozen pairs of hard [[leather]] [[hobnail boot]]s.\n* [[Bottle]]s of [[ink]], writing [[quill]]s, and sheets of [[parchment]].\n* Thousands of buttons carved out of bone in myriad sizes and styles.\n* More than a dozen fine [[steel]] [[dagger]]s with scabbards.\n* Three dozen thick [[tallow]] [[candle]]s.\nIf the trunk was removed from its resting place, it (or an identical copy) magically returned in about two [[tenday]]s with fresh contents. If the trunk was emptied and replaced, it took about the same interval for it to fill up again.\n\nThe potions, when present, usually numbered six, and were all in identical frosted glass vials sealed with preserved wooden stoppers and no indication of the function of their contents. There was no rhyme or reason to what sort of potion would appear in which slot, nor which slots would be left empty. If they were taken, replacements usually appeared like the chest, but seldom if ever to the same person or group twice in a row, ''i.e.'', if someone camped there and checked every day for new potions, they were likely to be disappointed.",
            "Darkhole": "[[File:SleepingDragon-Darkhole.png|thumb|right|275px|''Cut-away view of Darkhole, complete with a body wrapped in a shroud and bound with ropes.'']]\nAt the opposite end from the Wink was another, larger panel on a single pivot [[hinge]] that swung out over the downward curvature of the Sleeping Dragon. The slab was almost {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} wide, {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} high, and quite heavy. Even though it rested on a ridge in the design, the open door could be lifted out of its socket and removed. If the cover to the Darkhole was ever displaced or broken, it eventually reappeared, in place and intact. The chamber below was {{SI|2|ft}} deep and extended into the artifact for {{SI|6.5|ft|long=yes}}, seemingly sized to hold a tallish, [[human]]-sized body. Indeed, the word \"darkhole\" was an old slang term for a sepulcher or burial cavity in the wall of a tomb or catacomb.\n\nReports of the contents of the Darkhole varied from empty, to a pile of bones, to a body in a shroud, to an [[undead]] [[skeleton]] that attacked when disturbed. Once in a great while, [[adventurer]]s would lay a fallen comrade to rest in the Darkhole, but that rest likely lasted only until the next explorers came along, or possibly even less time.{{Cite dragon/292/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Sleeping Dragon|90}}",
            "The Wizard's Door": "[[File:SleepingDragon-WizardsDoor.png|thumb|right|400px|''Cut-away view of the Wizard's Door showing reclining couch, shelves with drinks and books, a lantern, and the eye of Savras judging the explorers.'']]\nThis panel was quite large, measuring out to {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} high by {{SI|7|long=yes}} long, and had to be pressed in two places simultaneously to release the catches before sliding it open enough to get fingers in and swing the panel fully open. Inside was a claustrophobic room with almost no floor space because the great majority was occupied by a human-sized reclining couch that could accommodate a fairly tall person. At the foot of the couch was room for a pair of boots and not much else. Above the recliner were two shelves carved into the stone. The upper one contained a number of bottles, [[flask]]s, and [[decanter]]s that contained water and  various [[wine]]s. The lower shelf contained three magnificent books and a squat, cylindrical [[lantern]] with three feet on the bottom and a loop on the top. The lantern was always lit with a ''[[continual flame]]'' inside.\n\nThe three books had locks, ribbon bookmarks, and metal-bound corners. Inside were pages of parchment that were often blank, but sometimes contained an [[arcane magic|arcane]] spell or two. The presence or lack of spells, and their rarity, seemed to be random. Spell collectors were advised to copy any spells they found because the books would mysteriously disappear from the possession of whomever tried to take them out of Dragon Wood, and reappear on the shelf. Likewise, if the lantern was removed from the Wizard's Door or destroyed, it reappeared on the shelf less than half a tenday later.\n\nMany adventurers who opened the Wizard's Door reported encountering a human-looking eye giving off a pale glow and hovering over the couch, staring at them, unblinking. Spells, ''[[turn undead|turning]]'', or physical force all had no effect on the eye and it soon faded away. Those that were brave enough to touch it with their bare hand reported seeing visions, hearing whispered messages, or, in one case, gaining a voice in their head that cajoled them to do things and haunted their dreams. At least one reliable report avowed that the eye was a manifestation of the god [[Savras]] the All-Seeing, and that the witness was recruited to serve him.",
            "The Splendor": "[[File:SleepingDragon-Splendor.png|thumb|right|250px|''Close-up view of the Splendor.'']]\nA swirling pattern of something akin to flames, force, or flora was carved near one end of the Sleeping Dragon, and it was known as the Splendor. All manner of properties were attributed to this strange glyph, but with the presence of the pixies, it was difficult to separate fact from fiction. As rumors went, the most numerous were about touching a magic item to the pattern and causing something to happen. Reports varied from no effect to wondrous explosions of light. Some claimed that their magic item was drained, or infused with awesome powers. The most reliable story was that of the Splendor draining a charge from an item and causing the [[moss]]y bottom of the Sleeping Dragon to give off a faint glow that reached to the ground in a shimmering curtain of dweomercraft. All those who placed themselves beneath the megalith felt physical comfort and satisfaction, as if they were simultaneously wearing a ''[[ring of sustenance]]'' and a ''[[ring of warmth]]''. This succor lasted for 24 hours and could only be called upon once per visit to the artifact."

        "Defenses": "The Dragon Wood had its own \"defense\" against the intrusion of large predators, ''[[teleport]]ing'' them many miles away. The Sleeping Dragon did the same to anyone that struck it with sufficient force, or cast a spell at it.Roughly based on a maximum distance of {{SI|500|mile|long=yes}} from the approximate location of the Dragon Wood. The Sleeping Dragon seemed to be impervious to any attempt to move it. As of the [[1370 DR|1370s DR]], the elements had taken a slight toll on the megalith's carvings, and it had moss growing on its underside, but no significant cracks or faults marred its ornate surface."
