        "mainbody": "Zucchini Saiyama style was the name given to a dish of the Ancients from the Living Jungle of the Malatran Plateau.\nZucchini Saiyama style was a stewed vegetable dish made using all the ingredients native to the Malatran Plateau. The recipe called for sweating diced onions, red bell peppers, with garlic. Once the vegetables turned tender, diced tomatoes and zucchini were added and simmered together. The stew was seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oregano. Lastly, cooked cannelloni beans were added. Once all the ingredients were done, the stew was served on ancient ceramic platters on a bed of cooked rice.\nIn the Year of Despair of the Malatran calendar (1375 DR), a band of heroes of the Living Jungle were recruited by Reesta, the chief of the Saiyama tribe, to recover an ancient plate of ceramic from a ruin of the Ancients. The adventurers embarked on their quest, thinking they were recovering a great treasure. Instead, they realized that the plate held a recipe for a dish of the Ancients, later named zucchini Saiyama style. Later, Reesta and his adventurers gathered the ingredients and participated in a great cooking competition among the jungle tribes. The Nubari were surprised to find out that the jungles spear-shaped zucchini were not just weed and garuda food, but also a delicious edible vegetable."
