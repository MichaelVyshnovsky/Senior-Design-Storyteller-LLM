A psychic reservoir was an item that was used by a mind flayer to store psionic energy for later use.
A reservoir looked like illithid mucous that was bound in a clear membrane. It was often mounted on its owners neck chain.
A reservoir could be recharged with psionic energy. Recharging cost one hour of an illithids concentration, as well as three times the energy that was stored in the end.
It was often supplied to illithid sentinels in major tunnels that led into Oryndoll.
