'''''Staves of banishment''''', also known as '''''wands of banishment''''', were a type of [[magic]]al [[staff|short staff]] created to rid the [[Prime Material plane]] of powerful other-worldly creatures.{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|78}}

==Description==
These light staves were usually crafted from [[shadow-wood]].

==Powers==
The staves possessed a limited number of charges of the [[spell]]s ''[[banishment]]'', ''[[dismissal]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'' and ''[[slow]]'', which could be cast by the wielder upon utterance of a [[command word]].

==History==
This type of staff was conceived by the young [[mage]] [[Savengriff]], apprentice of [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]]. He crafted just over a dozen of these powerful staves and distributed them among his friends and colleagues in [[the North]], including Khelben. He later lost one of these while exploring the [[Dungeon of the Crypt]] with the [[Company of Crazed Venturers]].

When [[Elminster Aumar]] examined one of these staves, he discovered its command word was ''"Baerlaguth"''.
