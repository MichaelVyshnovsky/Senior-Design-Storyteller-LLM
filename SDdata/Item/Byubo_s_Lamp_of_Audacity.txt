Byubos Lamp of Audacity was a unique magic item that could be found within the Rainbow Monastery in the Hordelands. It was associated with Byubo, the Padhasattva of Nyum (audacious courage).
This magic item looked like a normal butter lamp.
Only a true follower of the Padhran religion could hold the lamp without suffering harm, and they would instantly learn its powers. All others would instantly be struck dumb.Anyone who did not follow the Padhran religion would lose points of Wisdom when touching the lamp.
Followers of the Padhran religion (whether a priest or not) gained one of the following clerical spells at random if they filled the lamp with oil, lit it, and then meditated with it as a focus for three hours
* creeping doom
* confusion
* regenerate
* chariot of Sustarre
* conjure earth elemental
* earthquake
* fire storm
* wind walk
* resurrection
* control weather
Users were only allowed to access one of these spells per day and they were required to use the spell within 24 hours or it would disappear.
The lamp was held by a seated statue of Byubo in the Purple Priory of the Rainbow Monastery.
