        "mainbody": "The '''''Silverleaf rod''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[mace]] created in the glory days of the City of Song, [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "The ''Silverleaf rod'' was created with a distinctly dwarven shape and design. The bludgeon's head was [[silver]]-plated.",
        "Powers": "The ''Silverleaf rod'' carried a simple ''+2'' enchantment, however, when wielded against [[orc]]s and [[orog]]s, it became functionally an enchanted ''+3'' weapon. Additionally, when battling orcs and orogs, the weapon magically improved the wielder's defenses, similarly to a ''+1'' enchantment.",
        "History": "The bludgeon was created by the dwarven smiths and enchanters of Myth Drannor, before the city's destruction in the [[Weeping War]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the ''Silverleaf rod'', along with its sister weapon â€“ ''[[Silverleaf hatchet]]'', fell into the clawed hands of [[lizardfolk]], led by a mysterious [[sorcerer]] [[Malgi Hi]] who laired in tunnels of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]."
