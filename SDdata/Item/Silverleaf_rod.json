        "mainbody": "The Silverleaf rod was an enchanted dwarven mace created in the glory days of the City of Song, Myth Drannor.\nThe Silverleaf rod was created with a distinctly dwarven shape and design. The bludgeons head was silver-plated.\nThe Silverleaf rod carried a simple +2 enchantment, however, when wielded against orcs and orogs, it became functionally an enchanted +3 weapon. Additionally, when battling orcs and orogs, the weapon magically improved the wielders defenses, similarly to a +1 enchantment.\nThe bludgeon was created by the dwarven smiths and enchanters of Myth Drannor, before the citys destruction in the Weeping War. By the , the Silverleaf rod, along with its sister weapon â€“ Silverleaf hatchet, fell into the clawed hands of lizardfolk, led by a mysterious sorcerer Malgi Hi who laired in tunnels of the Dwarven Dungeons."
