        "Description": "''Fullblades'' were enormous, two-handed swords that were longer than ''[[greatsword]]s'' by {{SI|18|in}}",
        "Weaponology": "Medium-sized creatures were only capable of wielding a ''fullblade'' two-handed and even then needed special training. Large-sized creatures were capable of wielding it with either one or both hands.   Due to their size, ''fullblades'' dealt extremely heavy damage and had a higher propensity for lethal blows.",
        "Notable Users": "''Fullblades'' were often favored by [[fighter]]s and [[paladin]]s."
