        "mainbody": "The '''''moonlight glaive''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[Selûnite]] weapon that once belonged to [[Dame Aylin]], a daughter of [[Selûne]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The ''moonlight glaive'' was a magic [[polearm]] that glowed, illuminating an area of {{SI|20'|'\"|long=yes}} around it. It also possessed a strong ''+2'' enchantment that strengthened the weapons and guided the blade toward its targets. The ''moonlight glaive'' also dealt additional [[radiant]] damage with each slash. The wielder could also unleash the ''moonlight butterflies'' with a swing of the glaive. This magic summoned a vortex of illusory [[butterflies]] that glowed with Selûne's pale light. Swarmed by the magical insects, creatures trapped inside their area were made much easier to attack and suffered [[psychic]] damage.",
        "History": "The ''moonlight glaive'' belonged to the [[Nightsong]], Dame Aylin, who was imprisoned in the [[Shadowfell]] by [[Shar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. Aylin was ready to gift the powerful Selûnite glaive to those who would free her from the ancient prison."
