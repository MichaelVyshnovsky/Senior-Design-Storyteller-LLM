'''''Deathsend''''' was a ''+4 [[dagger]]'' created by the [[Obarskyr]] dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the ''[[Four from Cormyr (item set)|Four from Cormyr]]'' along with the ''[[Seal of Iron]]'', ''[[Silveredge]]'', and ''[[Fireblood]]''.

==Description==
''Deathsend'' was of relatively simple design, and made of fine steel. It gave off a soft golden glow at all times.

''Deathsend'' was intended to be kept in a compartment on the scabbard of the [[bastard sword]] ''Silveredge''.

==Powers==
''Deathsend'' had all the lethality of a ''+4 dagger'', and was intended to only be used in honorable combat and to deliver killing blows to fallen enemies. It could be pointed at a target and determine if they were a dishonorable, treacherous sort who deserved death (at least according to the standards of [[lawful good]] martial rules). If the bearer attempted to throw or backstab with ''Deathsend'', the dagger would refuse to permit such a dishonorable course of action and sabotage the attack.

==History==
''Deathsend'' was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. At some point, it had been claimed by the [[lich]] [[Adzerak]] and was kept in his lair of [[Barrenstone]]. In [[1369 DR]], it was found by [[adventurer]]s who went on to join it with the other ''Four from Cormyr''.
