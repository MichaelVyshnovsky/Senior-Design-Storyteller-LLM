Deathsend was a +4 dagger created by the Obarskyr dynasty. It was part of the set of magical items known as the Four from Cormyr along with the Seal of Iron, Silveredge, and Fireblood.
Deathsend was of relatively simple design, and made of fine steel. It gave off a soft golden glow at all times.
Deathsend was intended to be kept in a compartment on the scabbard of the bastard sword Silveredge.
Deathsend had all the lethality of a +4 dagger, and was intended to only be used in honorable combat and to deliver killing blows to fallen enemies. It could be pointed at a target and determine if they were a dishonorable, treacherous sort who deserved death (at least according to the standards of lawful good martial rules). If the bearer attempted to throw or backstab with Deathsend, the dagger would refuse to permit such a dishonorable course of action and sabotage the attack.
Deathsend was the property of the Obarskyr family, and was traditionally held by them. At some point, it had been claimed by the lich Adzerak and was kept in his lair of Barrenstone. In 1369 DR, it was found by adventurers who went on to join it with the other Four from Cormyr.
