Girdle of ogre blood was a unique belt imbued with protective magics and created by Caldinar the Wily some years before the late 13 century DR.
Caldinars girdle of ogre blood was a broad-sided belt made of tanned ogre hide and decorated with lozenges filled with black ogre blood.
This item possessed regenerative enchantments that made the wearer slowly yet continually heal. Additionally, the wearer of the belt could summon five ogres per day that would remain under the summoners command and disappear seventeen minutes later.
Caldinar the Wily created the girdle of ogre blood some years before the , along with many other magic items to protect himself during adventuring. Caldinar often wore the best and parted ways with it after death when his companions auctioned the girdle off. Eventually, the belt found its way to Icewind Dale by 1281 DR.
