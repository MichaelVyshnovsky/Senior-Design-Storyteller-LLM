'''''Blades of Chult''''' were [[enchanted]] [[greatsword]]s wielded by cruel slavers from the danger-filled jungles of [[Chult]].

==Powers==
These hefty blades were imbued with ''+1'' enchantments and were ensorcelled to produce potent [[poison]] that sapped the target's health and withered their physique.

==History==
These gruesome weapons originated from the jungles of Chult, wielded by its [[yuan-ti|serpentine]] slavers. In order to keep their "cattle" cooperating, the slavers used swords imbued with deadly poisons on the most spirited captives or on those who were brave enough to attempt an escape. A single cut was enough to make the unruly captives sick and suffering. It often took a promise of ''[[antidote]]'' to keep poisoned slaves in line. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, one ''Blade of Chult'' was sold in [[Westgate]], among countless unique rare weapons and armor on the city's [[Market Triangle]].
