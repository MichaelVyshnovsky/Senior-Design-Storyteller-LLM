Paper of forms was an enchanted sheet of paper that could be transformed into various objects with an application of origami skills.
Paper of forms was a colored sheet of paper.
A person skilled in origami could fold paper of forms into a variety of origami forms. With an utterance of a command word, folded paper transformed into a fully functional life-sized version of the origami piece. There were limits on what could be created with paper of forms. Only non-magical items could be created, both man-made and items created by nature, as well as mundane non-intelligent creatures. A single paper of forms could create an object not bigger than a small house.
The resulting creation radiated faint magic but otherwise was indistinguishable from what it was imitating. However, it was vulnerable to fire mundane flames almost always set the created item on fire and magical fire did the job one hundred percent of the time.
Paper of forms returned to its paper form only when the owner voiced the second command word, and it was reusable. If the origami was ever unfolded, paper of forms lost all of its magic and became useless.
A sheet of paper of forms could be created by an experienced maker of wondrous items with the use of animate objects and major creation spells.
