        "mainbody": "Empty Fields were enchanted kama that originated from the West Faer√ªn nation of Calimshan.\nEach of the Empty Fields weapons was enchanted with a simple +1 enchantment, and each of its slashes had a cointoss of a chance to reduce the opponents combat abilities by afflicting them with the doom spell.\nThe original Empty Fields were created in the area of southern Calimshan dotted with a number of small destroyed settlements sometime long before the 14 century DR. The details of the villages destruction were lost to history. Still, some sages suggested they were ravaged by some unrecorded pestilence that affected the baronys harvests, sending the villages inhabitants into bouts of violent dementia, leading to slaughter and mutual destruction of all inhabitants. The only things recovered from the massacre were blood-crusted kama later called the Empty Fields.\nBy the late 14 century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of Neverwinter and nearby lands."
