        "Powers": "Each of the ''Empty Fields'' [[weapon]]s was enchanted with a simple ''+1'' enchantment, and each of its slashes had a [[coin]]toss of a chance to reduce the opponent's combat abilities by afflicting them with the ''[[doom]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "The original ''Empty Fields'' were created in the area of southern [[Calimshan]] dotted with a number of small destroyed settlements sometime long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The details of the villages' destruction were lost to history. Still, some sages suggested they were ravaged by some unrecorded pestilence that affected the barony's harvests, sending the villages' inhabitants into bouts of violent dementia, leading to slaughter and mutual destruction of all inhabitants. The only things recovered from the massacre were blood-crusted kama later called the ''Empty Fields''.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these enchanted kama or copies made from the original, were found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] and nearby lands."
