A '''bo stick''' was a large stick used in combat, and was particularly favored by [[monk]]s.

==Description==
These sticks were approximately {{SI|5|ft}} long. They were slightly slower to use than the shorter [[jo stick]]s. Some bo sticks were made to be even taller than typical wielder, with lengths of {{SI|7|ft}}. They were very commonly used in [[Kara-Tur]].
