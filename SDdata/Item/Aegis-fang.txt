'''Aegis-fang''' was the weapon of [[Wulfgar|Wulfgar, son of Beornegar]], of the [[Tribe of the Elk]].

==Description==
The head of this beautiful, cold-forged weapon was made from [[mithral]], and the shaft was made from [[adamantite]]. A [[diamond]] coating was magically adhered to the entire weapon after its forging. The head was engraved with magical inscriptions, which were covered by the symbols of the dwarven gods [[Dumathoin]], [[Moradin]], and [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]].

Aegis-fang was a cumbersome weapon, but was perfectly balanced for Wulfgar. Any person under {{SI|6'5"|ft-in|long=yes}} in height and without considerable strength would have a hard time wielding it properly. 

==Power==
Aegis-fang was specifically attuned to its wielder Wulfgar and would magically return to his hands upon his telepathic command. In the hands of anyone else, the weapon would merely function as a warhammer with a generic ''+3'' [[enchantment]].

==History==
After Wulfgar's servitude to [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] was complete, the dwarf-king forged Aegis-fang for his adopted son as a special gift.

Wulfgar trained extensively with his new weapon. He used it in two battles against dragons &mdash; [[Ingeloakastimizilian]] ('''Icingdeath''') and [[Haerinvureem]] (Shimmergloom) &mdash; both with triumphant results. The battle against Icingdeath was directly ended by Aegis-fang, when Wulfgar threw it into a large icicle, which fell, piercing the dragon's heart.

He also used it in a battle beside [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and Bruenor when they were victorious in their brutal fight against the [[balor]] [[Errtu]].

In [[1365 DR]], [[Josi Puddles]] stole Aegis-fang, selling it off to the pirate captain [[Sheila Kree]]. The weapon was later recovered when the [[Companions of the Hall]] tracked down and defeated the pirate.<ref>
