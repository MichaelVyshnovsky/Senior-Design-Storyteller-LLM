Aegis-fang was the weapon of Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, of the Tribe of the Elk.
The head of this beautiful, cold-forged weapon was made from mithral, and the shaft was made from adamantite. A diamond coating was magically adhered to the entire weapon after its forging. The head was engraved with magical inscriptions, which were covered by the symbols of the dwarven gods Dumathoin, Moradin, and Clangeddin Silverbeard.
Aegis-fang was a cumbersome weapon, but was perfectly balanced for Wulfgar. Any person under  in height and without considerable strength would have a hard time wielding it properly. 
Aegis-fang was specifically attuned to its wielder Wulfgar and would magically return to his hands upon his telepathic command. In the hands of anyone else, the weapon would merely function as a warhammer with a generic +3 enchantment.
After Wulfgars servitude to Bruenor Battlehammer was complete, the dwarf-king forged Aegis-fang for his adopted son as a special gift.
Wulfgar trained extensively with his new weapon. He used it in two battles against dragons &mdash Ingeloakastimizilian (Icingdeath) and Haerinvureem (Shimmergloom) &mdash both with triumphant results. The battle against Icingdeath was directly ended by Aegis-fang, when Wulfgar threw it into a large icicle, which fell, piercing the dragons heart.
He also used it in a battle beside Drizzt DoUrden and Bruenor when they were victorious in their brutal fight against the balor Errtu.
In 1365 DR, Josi Puddles stole Aegis-fang, selling it off to the pirate captain Sheila Kree. The weapon was later recovered when the Companions of the Hall tracked down and defeated the pirate.
