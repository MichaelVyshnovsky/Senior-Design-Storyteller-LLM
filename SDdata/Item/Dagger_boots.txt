Dagger boots were utilitarian boots that were used to aid climbers and also served as weapons.
They were available for sale from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
These boots were made from fine leather and tempered steel, allowing a climber to easily find purchase when scaling surfaces. The heavy tread on these boots did make it much more difficult for the wearer to conceal their tracks.
Auroras catalogue did not list the price of this item.
