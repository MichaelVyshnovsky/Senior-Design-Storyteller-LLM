'''Dagger boots''' were utilitarian boots that were used to aid climbers and also served as weapons.

They were available for sale from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']].

==Uses==
These boots were made from fine leather and tempered steel, allowing a climber to easily find purchase when scaling surfaces. The heavy tread on these boots did make it much more difficult for the wearer to conceal their tracks.

==Prices==
Aurora's catalogue did not list the price of this item.
