        "Description": "Horseshoes were typically made of an [[iron]] or [[steel]] bar and hammered into a \"U\" shape. They were attached to horses by nailing them into their hooves, a process that was known as \"shoeing.\"",
        "Powers": "Horses equipped with these were capable of traveling farther, faster, and for much longer.\n\nWhen a horse's shoe became loosened, it made a clattering sound as it walked or ran. If the shoe came off completely, they were said to \"throw a shoe\" or \"lose a shoe\", and the horse was forced to slow and limp until it was replaced.",
