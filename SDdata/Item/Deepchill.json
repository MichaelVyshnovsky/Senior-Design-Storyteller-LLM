        "mainbody": "eepchill was a sentient dwarven frostbrand broadsword that came into the possession of Vinjarek the Mound King sometime before the mid&ndash14 century DR.\nThe blade reflected light as if it were made of ice.\nAs a dwarven weapon, Deepchill was only happy when underground, and moreso if its owner was a dwarf. It was intelligent and could speak Dwarvish as well as the lawful neutral alignment language, although its preference was always for using Dwarvish. It despised anyone with whom it was unable to speak.\nDeepchill was referred to both as \"it\" and as \"he/him\".\nThe sword had an exceptionally powerful magic edge and was twice as mighty when fighting wielders of fire. It also had the automatic ability to detect secret doors, detect sloping passages, and detect elevator/shifting rooms/walls, although the blade had to be within  or closer for these powers to function.\nIn ancient times, Deepchill belonged to a dwarven king in the North.\nThe blade was later found and claimed by the great wight Vinjarek, who declared himself the Mound King of the Tombs of Deckon Thar. While Deepchill was Vinjareks most prized possession, the sword disliked its lawful evil owner, who was unable to understand or speak with it. However, this did not stop the Mound King from gaining complete mastery over Deepchill. \nOver the centuries that followed, Deepchills fine scabbard rotted away, leaving only the gems that had once adorned it."
