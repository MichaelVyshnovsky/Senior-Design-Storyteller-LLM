        "mainbody": "'''''Deepchill''''' was a [[Sentient item|sentient]] [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ''[[frostbrand]]'' [[broadsword]] that came into the possession of [[Vinjarek|Vinjarek the Mound King]] sometime before the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The [[blade]] reflected light as if it were made of ice.",
        "Personality": "As a dwarven weapon, ''Deepchill'' was only happy when underground, and moreso if its owner was a dwarf. It was intelligent and could speak [[Dwarvish]] as well as the [[lawful neutral]] [[alignment language]], although its preference was always for using Dwarvish. It despised anyone with whom it was unable to speak.\n\n''Deepchill'' was referred to both as \"it\" and as \"he/him\".",
        "Powers": "The sword had an exceptionally powerful [[magic]] edge and was twice as mighty when fighting wielders of [[fire]]. It also had the automatic ability to ''[[detect secret doors]]'', ''[[detect sloping passages]]'', and ''[[detect elevator/shifting rooms/walls]]'', although the blade had to be within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} or closer for these powers to function.",
        "History": "In ancient times, ''Deepchill'' belonged to a dwarven king in [[the North]].\n\nThe blade was later found and claimed by the [[great wight]] Vinjarek, who declared himself the Mound King of the Tombs of Deckon Thar. While ''Deepchill'' was Vinjarek's most prized possession, the sword disliked its [[lawful evil]] owner, who was unable to understand or speak with it. However, this did not stop the Mound King from gaining complete mastery over ''Deepchill''. \n\nOver the centuries that followed, ''Deepchill''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fine scabbard rotted away, leaving only the gems that had once adorned it."
