A '''''ring of truth''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[ring]] capable of detecting any lie.

==Powers==
This [[magic item]] was both a blessing and a curse to whoever wore it. It allowed them to know whenever anyone was lying to them, no matter how small. However, it also prevented them from lying or telling a harmless fib. The voice of anyone lying to the wearer of this ring would rise to a falsetto when they lied. A ''ring of truth'' could not penetrate magical lies created either by [[spell]]s, [[potion]]s, etc. Instead, the wearer would not be able to hear the voice of anyone attempting to lie via magical means, which in effect gave away their lie.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Akyid al-Neti]], the Headmaster of [[Al-Bidir Sallah]] in [[Huzuz]], wore a ''ring of truth''.
* [[Maerovyna]], a [[druid]] of [[Chauntea]] who lived in [[Daggerford]], carried a ''ring of truth''.
* [[Vurgrom]], a pirate captain in the [[Pirate Isles]], came into possession of a ''ring of truth'' around [[1359 DR]].
