        "mainbody": "'''Ka figures''', also known as '''spirit statues''', were a variety of funerary statuettes that the people of [[Sokkar]] would place inside the tombs of their deceased. They were believed by the Sokkarans to hold the deads' ''ka'' ([[spirit|soul]]) once their physical remains were properly mummified and interned.",
        "Description": "The details and features of ka figures varied greatly, with the rich and powerful of Sokkar having more intricate and opulent ones. They were made to depict the person whose ''ka'' they were meant to hold. In the more elaborate tombs of Sokkar, one could find multiple vaults depicting servants sacrificed to serve in the afterlife, including concubines, dancers, guards, musicians, porters, slaves, wives, and even pets.",
        "History": "When [[Edimu]], a beloved [[horse]] from [[Jazirat al-Sayyad]], passed from the world [[Stable of Eternity|a mausoleum]] was constructed for him in Sokkar. Placed within this mausoleum was a life-sized ka figure made of [[alabaster]]. It was adorned with a [[gold]]en [[bit and bridle]], However, [[ghoul]]s later looted the chambers and stole Edimu's bit and bridle, breaking his ka figure in the process, and thus untethering his spirit from the afterlife.\n\nIn [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} a group of [[adventurer]]s came to Sokkar and Edimu's spirit pleaded with them to retrieve his bit and bridle from the ghouls, showing them to his mausoleum and the smashed ka figure within."
