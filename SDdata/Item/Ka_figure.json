        "mainbody": "Ka figures, also known as spirit statues, were a variety of funerary statuettes that the people of Sokkar would place inside the tombs of their deceased. They were believed by the Sokkarans to hold the deads ka (soul) once their physical remains were properly mummified and interned.\nThe details and features of ka figures varied greatly, with the rich and powerful of Sokkar having more intricate and opulent ones. They were made to depict the person whose ka they were meant to hold. In the more elaborate tombs of Sokkar, one could find multiple vaults depicting servants sacrificed to serve in the afterlife, including concubines, dancers, guards, musicians, porters, slaves, wives, and even pets.\nWhen Edimu, a beloved horse from Jazirat al-Sayyad, passed from the world a mausoleum was constructed for him in Sokkar. Placed within this mausoleum was a life-sized ka figure made of alabaster. It was adorned with a golden bit and bridle, However, ghouls later looted the chambers and stole Edimus bit and bridle, breaking his ka figure in the process, and thus untethering his spirit from the afterlife.\nIn 1367 DR, a group of adventurers came to Sokkar and Edimus spirit pleaded with them to retrieve his bit and bridle from the ghouls, showing them to his mausoleum and the smashed ka figure within."
