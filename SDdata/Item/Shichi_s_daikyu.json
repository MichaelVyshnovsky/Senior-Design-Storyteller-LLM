        "mainbody": "hichis daikyu was the magical daikyu (great bow) of Shichi No Ken, a paladin of Amaterasu, in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIt was a +2 daikyu. Designed for Shichis size and strength, only archers with great strength could draw it far enough to take advantage of its accuracy and power others would have to rest for a number of minutes or not use it at all. In addition, twice a day, an arrow loosed from it could fly unerringly and strike with maximum impact.\nAlong with a katana, the daikyu was enchanted and gifted to Shichi by the Grand Master of Flowers when she departed the Seven Roses Monastery in Pe Nok to become a \"walking initiate\"."
