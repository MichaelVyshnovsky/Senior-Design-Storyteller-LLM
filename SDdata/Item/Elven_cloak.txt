An '''''elven cloak''''' was a [[magic item]] that allowed the wearer to become [[invisibility|invisible]].

==Powers==
When worn, an ''elven cloak'' made the wearer completely invisible most of the time. The invisibility would wear off if they attacked or cast a [[spell]] and could not be used again for ten minutes.

==Notable Owners==
[[Shoon VII]], one of the vile rulers of the [[Shoon Imperium]], wore an ''elven cloak''.
