An elven cloak was a magic item that allowed the wearer to become invisible.
When worn, an elven cloak made the wearer completely invisible most of the time. The invisibility would wear off if they attacked or cast a spell and could not be used again for ten minutes.
Shoon VII, one of the vile rulers of the Shoon Imperium, wore an elven cloak.
