        "History": "''Larloch's Soul Stealer'' was created by the infamous [[necromancer]] and lich, Larloch. The ring was used to harvest souls for the [[undead]] mage's magical experiments. At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Larloch's Soul Stealer'' was accepted by [[Mintassan]] the Magnificent. The planeswalking [[wizard]] added the precious ring to his collections of curios from across the worlds, displayed in [[Mintassan's Mysteries]], his site on Westgate's [[Market Triangle]]. Mintassan warned the uninitiated to dabble with the ring's dangerous magics at their own peril."
