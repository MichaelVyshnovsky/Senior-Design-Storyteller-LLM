        "mainbody": "Gloves of swordplay were magical items that increased the wearers aptitude with blades.\nThe gloves appeared as simple leather gloves.\nGloves of swordplay and their greater iteration increased the users ability to safely parry incoming melee attacks.\nThe first gloves of swordplay were commissioned by Eisneid Clume, a hapless dueler. She has been badly hurt in seven duels before she sought the help of magic. Once she started using these magical gloves, she won over thirty duels without a single scratch. Eventually, the rumors of her skills origins led to the dramatic increase in swordplay skill all across Hillsfar.\n* Eisneid Clume, the original owner."
