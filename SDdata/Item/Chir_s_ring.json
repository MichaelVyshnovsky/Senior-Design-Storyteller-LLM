        "mainbody": "'''''Chir's ring''''' was created and [[enchanted]] by the [[deep gnome]] [[wizard]] [[Chir Darkflame]], active in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "''Chir's ring'' was nothing but a small bent wire that held a small sliver of [[amethyst]] in place, only vaguely resembling an actual ring.",
        "Powers": "The item's unimpressive appearance hid a useful enchantment that slightly increased the wearer's intelligence and allowed them to memorize once additional lower-complexity [[spell]] per day. Chir's enchantments made sure that the ring could only be used by wizards, those who despised [[law]], and [[gnome]]s only.",
        "History": "Chir Darkflame proudly claimed that her ring was the first thing she's enchanted and refused to part with the piece of makeshift jewelry willingly. The ring was enchanted sometime before her capture by the [[illithid]] slavers of the black market in the mountains of [[Samarach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
