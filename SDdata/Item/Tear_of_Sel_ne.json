        "mainbody": "The '''''Tear of Sel没ne''''' was a major [[artifact]] of both great value and power that naturally made any [[magic]] in its vicinity more intense and dangerous. When combined with three other magical items, it could also be used to bring about great destructive force against evildoers.",
        "Description": "This artifact was quite massive in size, comparable to an [[ogre]]'s clenched fist, its surface formed of rough, unpolished crystal. Unlike other meteorites, it was in fact a great [[diamond]]. Anyone attuned to magical doings could feel that it radiated incredible energy.",
        "Powers": "Simply by its own passive nature, the Tear had a significant effect on magic in its vicinity, for any spell cast within a hundred feet (30 meters) of it would act at maximum effect, as well as if cast by a caster much greater in power.\n\nAny bearer of the Tear who also possessed the two steel keys was capable of unleashing stunning power from the skies, as they could summon a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' at will, which could strike anywhere in the Realms within their sight (whether directly or by [[scry]]ing). If only one key was employed, the wielder would have to perform a complex litany of prayers to the Moonmaiden in order to call upon this power, as well as to protect themselves from the Tear's more dire effects. The goddess was also known to sometimes dispatch a ''swarm'' of her own accord so as to protect her followers.\n\nHaving both keys, which joined together to form a steel rod of twice the length of either, allowed the Tear's owner to draw down ''[[meteor swarm]]''s without danger. Without them, however, the wielder was also in increasing danger of being divided by the artifact's cosmic energy into two identical undead beings. One was of pure good and the other evil, both with the full memories of the original and the belief that they were the original. They would be bound to struggle against one another forever or until one was destroyed.\n\nThe ''[[staff of the Shard]]'', which was otherwise only used to track down the Tear's location when lost, had other powers mysterious and unknown, although Sel没nite lore suggested it could be employed in healing, locating the lost in general (whether people, places, or items), striking enemies to explosive effect, and radiating light.",
        "History": {
            "Destruction": "Unsurprisingly, many sages believed that the Tear would only return to the heavens if Tymora and Beshaba merged to once more become Tyche. Since the likelihood of that event was quite remote, other arcanists suggested that it could be destroyed by an avatar of [[Shar]], but only during a time when [[Mystra]] was either dead or in some manner blocked from the Realms, something which would greatly weaken both the new Mystra and Sel没ne herself.<ref group=\"note\">Whether Shar took advantage of the death of Mystra that she had engineered through Cyric in [[1385 DR]] to destroy the Tear, and if so whether this had any effect on the severity of the [[Spellplague]], is unknown. If it remains in the Realms, it is also unknown what the damage to the Weave may have done to the Tear and its powers. Still others said that the meteorite, as well as the keys and staff, would only shatter if employed to release their power in the name of true evil."
