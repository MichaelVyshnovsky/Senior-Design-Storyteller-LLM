        "mainbody": "A rod of the bloodthorn was a type of enchanted rod that was said to thirst for blood.\nA blow from a rod of the bloodthorn was very powerful, but it became even more powerful in the presence of blood. The rod did not distinguish between the blood of an enemy or of its wielder.\nIf a rod of the bloodthorn was used to land a particularly fierce blow, the wielder could use the item to drain the life from their target. This power could be used only once each day.\n* The Ice Queen Iyraclea kept a rod of the bloodthorn in her tower on the Great Glacier."
