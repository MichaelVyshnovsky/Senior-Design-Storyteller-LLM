        "mainbody": "A ring of truth was an enchanted ring capable of detecting any lie.\nThis magic item was both a blessing and a curse to whoever wore it. It allowed them to know whenever anyone was lying to them, no matter how small. However, it also prevented them from lying or telling a harmless fib. The voice of anyone lying to the wearer of this ring would rise to a falsetto when they lied. A ring of truth could not penetrate magical lies created either by spells, potions, etc. Instead, the wearer would not be able to hear the voice of anyone attempting to lie via magical means, which in effect gave away their lie.\n* Akyid al-Neti, the Headmaster of Al-Bidir Sallah in Huzuz, wore a ring of truth.\n* Maerovyna, a druid of Chauntea who lived in Daggerford, carried a ring of truth.\n* Vurgrom, a pirate captain in the Pirate Isles, came into possession of a ring of truth around 1359 DR."
