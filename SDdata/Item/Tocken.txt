A '''tocken''' was a set of wooden carved oval open-ended [[bell]]s that could be played either with hammers or open handed. There was also a version that used [[silver]] bells that was popular in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/335/New Olamn Bard College|26}}

==Description==
Wooden tockens were often made of [[phandar]]. Tockens were usually mounted hanging from a crossbeam of cane or a wooden branch (sometimes the whole thing was attached to a pole){{Cite dragon/123/Music of the Forgotten Realms|14}} and struck with mallets. Their sound was very pleasant and brought out subtle tones from the wood,{{Cite dragon/335/New Olamn Bard College|26}}

Wooden tockens were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
