Weapon masters scale was a magical suit of scale mail armor intended solely for weapon masters to wear.
It was +2 scale mail that granted the wearer greater readiness for combat and the ability to knock down foes. It could only be worn by a weapon master.
Circa 1374 DR, the kobold bard turned merchant Deekin Scalesinger had the armor in his stock in the Merchant District of Neverwinter.
