Jellied eggs was an appetizer dish from the Red Wizards nation of Thay.
Jellied eggs were served on a bed of pickled rice as a meal starter in Priadors capital â€“ Bezantur. The dish was quite delicate and the jelly was green in color while the eggs inside were still soft with blood-red runny yolk. Each egg was encased in a green oval-shaped jelly. The appetizer was sometimes served before a main dish such as peppered gnolls tongues.
As of the , Aznar Thrul, the Zulkir of Evocation and the Tharchion of Priador considered peppered gnolls tongues to be a delicacy while jellied eggs reminded him of delicate flesh easily parted with a knife, similarly to how he experimented on his slaves flesh.
