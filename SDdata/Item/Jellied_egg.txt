'''Jellied eggs''' was an appetizer dish from the [[Red Wizards]]' nation of [[Thay]].

==Description==
Jellied [[egg]]s were served on a bed of [[pickled rice]] as a meal starter in [[Priador]]'s capital â€“ [[Bezantur]]. The dish was quite delicate and the jelly was green in color while the eggs inside were still soft with blood-red runny yolk. Each egg was encased in a green oval-shaped jelly. The appetizer was sometimes served before a main dish such as peppered [[gnolls' tongues]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Aznar Thrul]], the [[Zulkir of Evocation]] and the [[Tharchion]] of Priador considered peppered gnolls' tongues to be a delicacy while jellied eggs reminded him of delicate flesh easily parted with a knife, similarly to how he experimented on his slaves' flesh.
