        "mainbody": "'''''Dust of disappearance''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] substance that could be used to turn a number of creatures temporarily invisible.",
        "Description": "''Dust of disappearance'' resembled very fine metallic dust. It was common for it to be found in small silk that contained enough of it for a single use. It was also known to be stored in bone tubes. The powder resembled fine [[sand]],",
        "Powers": "Upon throwing the dust up in the air, it rendered all creatures and objects within a {{SIAdj|10|ft}} radius invisible for a few minutes. For each individual creature, the invisibility could be cut short if the subject cast a [[spell]] or performed an attack or aggressive action.\n\nThe effect resembled the ''[[greater invisibility]]'' spell, and could not even be detected by magical means such as ''[[see invisibility]]'' or ''[[invisibility purge]]''.",
