A '''''teleport ring''''' was a small, brass finger ring that allowed its wearer to ''[[teleport without error]]'' as per the [[arcane]] [[spell]]. The only difference was they did not allow for travel across [[cosmology|the planes]].

==History==
These rings were once more common in [[Faer√ªn]] but were very rare circa [[1369 DR]].
