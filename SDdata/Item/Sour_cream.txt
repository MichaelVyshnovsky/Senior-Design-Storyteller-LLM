'''Sour cream''' was a dairy product eaten in the [[Savage Frontier]], [[the Vast]], and [[Tethyr]].

==Availability==
In the [[Western Heartlands]] and the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], sour cream was often eaten with [[baguette]]s.

In the Savage Frontier, sour cream could be found in the town of [[Yartar]]. [[Beldar's Rest]] inn had fried [[potato]]es on offer, flavored with a sauce of [[parsley]], [[chive]]s, and sour cream.

Further south, sour cream was consumed in Tethyr. [[Morgan's Inn]] in the city of [[Velen]] served highsunfeast of marinated [[herring]] topped with spur cream.

In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the [[Dragon Reach]], massive two-pound potatoes were filled with [[butter]], [[cheese]], and sour cream. This simple dish was worthy of the nobility's table, including [[Lauren Devillars]]'s feasts.

During his visits to [[Earth]] to meet [[Mordenkainen]] and [[Rautheene]] in [[Ed Greenwood]]'s estate, [[Elminster]] was known to have some of the Earth's sour cream with potato chips.{{Cite dragon/344/A Dark and Stormy Knight|60}}
