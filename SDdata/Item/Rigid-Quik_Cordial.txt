Rigid-Quik Cordial was a medicinal potion concocted and sold by Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak of Bonecloaks Apothecary, Baldurs Gate, in the late 15 century DR.
In the , Lady Madeline Whitburn of the Whitburn family of the Upper City, made a discrete purchase of Rigid-Quik Cordial via her butler, Blathers, to aid Lord "Whit" Whitburns problem of "stiffness". Lady Whitburn used double the recommended dosage, mixing it with a glass of evening sherry to absolutely no effect. Madeline mailed a complaint letter to the proprietors of Bonecloaks Apothecary demanding money back or an alternative potion that would aid Lord Whitburn. She asked the Bonecloaks to discretely offer an alternative upon Blatherss next visit.
