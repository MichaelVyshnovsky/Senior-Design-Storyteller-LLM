The headdresses were created by shamans of the Shattered Spear tribe to be used by younger generations of Batiri. When worn, jungle headdresses whispered advice, secrets of the wild, and survival tips into the owners ears.\n*Taelunangul, the chieftain on the Batiri Shattered Spear tribe circa a 1374 DR."
