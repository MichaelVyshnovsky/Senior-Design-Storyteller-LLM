'''Violine''' gems were purple and volcanic in nature.<ref group="note">This stone was originally named "violane" after a real-world gemstone and appeared in [[Dragon magazine 72]] on pages 15 and 17, but was misspelled when the description was reprinted in ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'', page 134, ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', page 53, and ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'', page 300.

==Description==
Found in deposits mixed with other minerals and occasionally of exceptional (up to [[human]] fist) size, this [[ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] was usually cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] and polished, or [[wikipedia:facet|faceted]] baguette style. A typical stone had a base value of 10 gp.

Violine stones were considered sacred by followers of [[Ghaunadaur]]&mdash;appropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}

==Powers==
This gem was proof against [[mummy rot]]. A creature with mummy rot only had to touch a violine crystal and the mummy rot was removed. The violine was completely consumed by this process. If this stone came into contact with an actual [[mummy]], it burst and damaged the mummy. If a mummy was destroyed by contact with violine, the resulting [[mummy dust]] was inert and could not be used as a spell component or for other magical purposes.
