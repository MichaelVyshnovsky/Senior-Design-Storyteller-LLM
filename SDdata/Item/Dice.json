Though dice also came in a variety of other geometric shapes that sported more numbers. Typical dice sets came in leather cups, which were often used for rolling them, though others simply shook them in their hands before throwing them on to the floor or table.\n\nMultiple games could be played with dice, such as various gambling games and other bar-entertainment.",
