        "mainbody": "'''''Rings of magic defences''''' were [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s designed specially for use in [[wizard]]s' duels.",
        "Powers": "These simple-in-appearance rings were imbued with enchantments that improved the wearer's spellcrafting skills, increased their resistance to magic, and allowed them to cast ''[[dispel magic]]'' once per day.",
        "History": "These rings were especially popular in cities among spellcasters who often entered into magical duels. Even the weakest [[wizard]] could stave off powerful spells, albeit for only a short period of time. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these rings could be found in many huge settlements along the [[Sword Coast]], including the city of [[Neverwinter]]."
