        "mainbody": "Breastplates of silent moves were sets of magically enchanted and well-oiled medium armor that allowed the wearer to move silently without suffering the negative effects of wearing bulky armor.\nBreastplates of silent moves varied in appearance.\nThese sets of armor were specifically created to help the users of medium armor remain undetected, making as little sound as possible. The armor was well-oiled, making it significantly quieter than regular breastplates, and the magic enchantment on the sets dampened sound around it. The use of the breastplates of silent moves enhanced the owners silent movement.\n* Kesefehon, an elf commander of Myth Drannor wore his +2 breastplate of silent moves adorned with a wolf insignia in battle and was entombed with it. His set of armor was valued at 16,350 gp."
