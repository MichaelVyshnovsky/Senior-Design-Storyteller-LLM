        "mainbody": "'''Glowstones''' were artificial gems developed by ancient [[dwarves]] and whose method of creation was lost to time.",
        "Description": "''Glowstones'' were transparent, faceted, and oval gemstones the size of a palm.",
        "Powers": "''Glowstones'' continuously emitted a white radiance, comparable to the spell ''[[continual light]]'', but did not produce any heat. ''Glowstones'' could not be dimmed by magically induced darkness or ''[[dispel magic]]''. Each possessed 1,000 charges and were unable to be recharged, except by another ''glowstone''. When this latter action was performed it was said that the transference of energy between two stones would cause any poisons, diseases, or parasitic infestations to be purified from their wielder's body.\n\nWhen brought into contact with any [[magical item]] a ''glowstone'' would adhere to it, as if magnetized, and would slowly siphon out energy to restore whatever empty magical charges the item may have. If a magical item had no charges, but did have a limited number of uses, then the energy released by a ''glowstone'' would bestow upon the item an extra use. The amount of charges of magical energy lost was always equal to the amount transferred. Whenever transferring this energy to an item a ''glowstone's'' radiance would pulsate and flicker.  \n\nDwarven [[clerics]] were capable of releasing the magical energy within ''glowstone'' in the form of a beam of radiant force by using the spell ''[[glowglory]]''. This beam was known to be capable of easily cutting through flesh, wood, and stone.\n\nOnce fully drained of their energy by natural means a ''glowstone'' would grow dim and crumble into dust. If deliberately destroyed through use of magic, physical force, or a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell then they would violently explode with a blast of radiant light.",
        "History": "''Glowstones'' were developed by expert dwarven blacksmiths in the city of [[Myth Drannor]].",
