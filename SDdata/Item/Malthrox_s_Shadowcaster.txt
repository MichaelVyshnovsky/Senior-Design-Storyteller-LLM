'''''Malthrox's Shadowcaster''''' was a [[enchanted|magical]] [[lantern]].{{Cite dragon/179/7 Enlightening Lanterns|29}}

==Description==
''Malthrox's Shadowcaster'' appeared to be an ordinary [[oil]] lantern made of bluish metal, featuring shutters on all four sides. The lantern had a wooden handle with a bone grip. Two of the shutters bore inscriptions, which could only be read using ''[[read magic]]''. When handled by anyone other than a [[mage]], ''Malthrox's Shadowcaster'' functioned as a regular lantern. However, when held by a mage, its powers were communicated telepathically.

==Abilities==
The runes inscribed on the outside of the shutters read "''Bizzait''" and "''Missathac''." When only the shutter marked "''Bizzait''" was opened and the word was spoken, the narrow beam of light produced had the power to ''[[dispel magic]]''. This power could be used three times per day. The area of effect encompassed a {{SIAdj|30|ft|long=yes|adj=square}} area upon which the lantern's light first fell, including any creatures within this area, with a range of {{SIrange|10|20|yd|long=yes}}. Interestingly, beyond this range, the light beam maintained the same diameter, although it was roughly conical before that point.

When the word "''Missathac''" was uttered and the corresponding shutter was opened, a {{SIAdj|1|ft|c|long=yes|adj=wide}} bright beam of light flashed forward, striking the nearest object within a {{SIAdj|60|ft|long=yes}} range. If the beam hit a living creature, it produced a ''shadowclone''.

The ''shadowclone'' was a spectral replica of the creature caught in the lantern's beam. This clone mirrored the original in terms of size, speed, and held weapons, but with notable differences. The ''shadowclone'' was incapable of casting [[spell]]s or using [[psionic]]s, and any magical items it duplicated were devoid of magical properties. The clone could only be harmed by weapons that were enchanted, though it remained susceptible to spells unless they were countered by the clone's magic resistance.

The ''shadowclone'' was completely under the control of the lantern bearer, requiring the bearer's concentration to remain active. If the bearer's concentration was interrupted, either by a successful attack or other disturbances, the clone was dispelled. This power was limited to once per week. If any other shutters were open when the command was spoken, the power did not activate.
