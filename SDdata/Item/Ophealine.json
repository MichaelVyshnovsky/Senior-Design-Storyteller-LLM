The purple or violet variety was called yanolite.\nOphealine occurred in large crystals that yielded faceted gemstones of impressive size, and was hard enough to be used in jewelry, especially rings, that were subject to the wear and tear of everyday use. The typical brown hue was so intense that bigger crystals looked opaque.\nThe purple yanolite was considered sacred by followers of Ghaunadaur&mdashappropriate for sacrifice, or to be consecrated for use, or recognized as boons or omens when found.\nOphealine had an anti-magic quality such that it could not be used as a material component in any spell, potion, ink or other magical preparation&mdashthe magic always failed. When worn as an ornament, ophealine prevented hold person spells and all manner of magical paralyzing effects from being effective."
