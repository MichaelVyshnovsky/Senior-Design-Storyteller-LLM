'''''Frost''''' was a [[weapon quality|quality]] that could be added to a magical weapon, making it dangerously cold.

==Powers==
When commanded, a sheath of intense cold enveloped the weapon, causing it to inflict freezing injuries. A ranged weapon with this enhancement would pass it to its ammunition. The icy cold didn't hurt the weapon's wielder, and the effect could be ended with another command.

==Uses==
[[Helmed horror]]s could enhance their blades with several magical qualities, including ''frost''.

==Creation==
The creator must use either ''[[chill metal]]'' or ''[[ice storm]]'' when crafting the weapon to add this property.

==Known ''Frost'' Weapons==
* ''[[Icingdeath]]'', [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]'s right-hand [[scimitar]].
* ''[[Stealthwhisper]]'' and ''[[Shadowblade]]'', the twin weapons of the thief god [[Mask]].
* ''[[Drowning Death]]'', the personal weapon of [[Umberlee]], the sea goddess.
