        "mainbody": "horn of bubbles was a type of cursed horn that produced an array of soapy suds to inconvenience those who blew them.\nThese horns were known vary widely in appearance. Some resembled mere mundane horns, while others bore a resemblance to known types of magical horns.\nIn the hands of most individuals, a horn of bubbles would produce no sound upon being blown. The cursed effect of the horn was delayed, triggering the next time someone was actively trying to kill the individual who had blown the horn. When this occurred, the horn would sound a note and manifest an array of soapy suds, similar to the breath weapon of a pink dragon, that completely surrounded and blinded the horn blower for anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes.\nIn the hands of a proper bard, a horn of bubbles would instead sound upon being played and expel a mass of bubbles, covering a  conical area. Those caught in this barrage of soapy sups would similarly find themselves blinded for a period of 2 to 20 minutes. However, a horn of bubbles was not without danger for the bard, as it had a 5% chance of backfiring, or a 1% chance in the case of a jester. When this occurred a horn of bubbles would suck the blower through it and polymorph them into the bubbles it expelled. If the bard was not polymorphed back before all bubbles popped, they would be irrevocably dead.\n* Perizade, a dragon turtle that lived in a small network of underwater caves below the island of Sahu, had a horn of bubbles as part of her treasure horde in 1367 DR.\nIn the , a small pack of leucrotta were lairing within the Arcane Chambers level of Undermountain. Within the room they settled down in, the leucrotta amassed a sizeable horde of treasure, which included a gold-plated steel horn of bubbles."
