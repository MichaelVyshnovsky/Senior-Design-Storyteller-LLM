Shou Lung Topaz was found in Shou Lung and the other mysterious nations to the east of Faerûn. It was imported to western Faerûn by travelers from those lands.
This bold yellow stone was a form of corundum making it harder than regular topaz and able to make fine gems.
This gem stone recalled the fiery yellow of some cats eyes and was used in the construction of magic items associated with felines. Rumor gave it many magical properties but what they might have been has not yet been documented.
