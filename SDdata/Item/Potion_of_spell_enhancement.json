        "mainbody": "A potion of spell enhancement was a potion that increased the power of the casters spells.\nWhen a mage consumed such a potion, the spells they cast became much more powerful. This potion, however, only lasted for a short duration.\nIn 1358 DR, a chamber to the southwest of Leilon was highly guarded by undead such as spectres and wights . The undead guardians appeared to be protecting a potent potion of spell enhancement."
