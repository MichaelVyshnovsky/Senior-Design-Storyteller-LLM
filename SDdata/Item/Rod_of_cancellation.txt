A rod of cancellation was a powerful magic item that drained other magic items of their enchantments.
For a rod of cancellation to drain the power from another magic item, the rod needed to physically touch the target item. Once drained, a magic item could never have its lost powers restored even via a wish. A rod of cancellation became brittle and useless once its power was used successfully.
Thardock, who was an officer in the Purple Dragons, carried a rod of cancellation.
