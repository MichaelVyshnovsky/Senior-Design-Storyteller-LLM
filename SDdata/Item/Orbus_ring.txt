An '''''orbus ring''''' was a type of [[magic]]al jewelry that improved the speed at which a [[mage]] could navigate a [[spelljammer]] while at its [[Spelljamming helm|helm]].{{Cite dragon/159/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Magic from the stars}}

==Description==
These extremely sought-after rings were carved from [[ivory]] intertwined with [[platinum]]. Their power was drawn from residual magic of the remains of an [[orbus]].

==Powers==
When not at a spelljamming helm, the wearer of an ''orbus ring'' experienced no magical effect or enhancement of abilities.

==History==
An original, and more powerful, set of ''orbus rings'' was crafted long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], although the secret of their construction was lost for over a hundred years. However, a cache of these rings were eventually discovered on the [[Rock of Bral]]. The only known dealer of these 2{{nd}} generation rings was the [[spelljammer|spelljamming]] expert, [[Gamalon Idogyr]].
