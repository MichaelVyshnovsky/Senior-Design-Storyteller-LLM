Boots of tumbling were enchanted boots worn by the Scarlet Mummers of Lliira in the late 14 century DR.
Boots of tumbling and their weaker version, lesser boots of tumbling, were simple magic boots that boosted the wearers ability to tumble out of harms way.
Boots of tumbling were created to be used exclusively by the acrobatic militant order of Lliira, the Scarlet Mummers, and worn in their war against the agents of the Maiden of Pain. By the late 14 century DR, these boots found their way into the hands of merchants and adventurers of northwest Faer√ªn and the Sword Coast North.
