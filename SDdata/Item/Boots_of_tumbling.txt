'''''Boots of tumbling''''' were [[enchanted]] boots worn by the [[Scarlet Mummers]] of [[Lliira]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
''Boots of tumbling'' and their weaker version, ''lesser boots of tumbling'', were simple magic boots that boosted the wearer's ability to tumble out of harm's way.

==History==
''Boots of tumbling'' were created to be used exclusively by the acrobatic militant order of Lliira, the Scarlet Mummers, and worn in their war against the [[Church of Loviatar|agents]] of the [[Loviatar|Maiden of Pain]]. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, these boots found their way into the hands of merchants and adventurers of [[northwest Faer√ªn]] and the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Notable Owners==
*[[Dela Nereth]], a black-market merchant of the [[Bloodsailors]] of [[Neverwinter]] in [[1372 DR]].
