'''''Bolts of Sekolah's fire''''' were [[enchanted]] aquatic [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s of [[sahuagin]] make.

==Description==
''Bolts of Sekolah's fire'' were long and thin tubes that ended with a plunger. The hollow space within the tubes was filled with foul fish-smelling thick gooey liquid.

==Powers==
When one of these unique bolts was shot from a crossbow, the plunger at the back end of the bolt pushed out the liquid inside in a thin {{SI|40'|'"|long=yes}} long stream. The moment the liquid left its tube, it reacted with oxygen in air or water and ignited, becoming thin but deadly streams of living flame. To make the weapon even more deadly, the flaming viscous goo coated its targets, continuing sizzling the targets.

==History==
These bolts were most often seen in the weed hands of high-ranking sahuagin. As of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, sahuagin that dwelt within an ancient temple on the [[Isle of the Great Wyrm]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] were armed with crossbows that fired ''bolts of Sekolah's fire''.
