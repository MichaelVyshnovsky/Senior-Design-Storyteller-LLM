A talisman of pure good was a magic item that a goodly priest could use to smite a wicked priest.
The talisman contained a stone for each charge.
In the hands of a pure-hearted priest, a talsiman of pure good could open a crack in the ground beneath the feet of a wicked priest, swallowing them forever and hurtling them to the center of the earth. Any hints of impurity in the heart and mind of the wielding priest gave the wicked priest a chance to resist the talismans magic. These items contained seven charges and could not be recharged.
Any priest who was not pure of heart suffered great harm when touching a talisman of pure good. Non-priests could touch the item without harm but could not use its magic.
Anhurs lance possessed the magical properties of a talisman of pure good.
