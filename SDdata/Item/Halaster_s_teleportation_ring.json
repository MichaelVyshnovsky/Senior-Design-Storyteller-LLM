        "mainbody": "'''''Halaster's teleportation rings''''' were [[magic item]]s that allowed the wearer to ''[[teleport without error]]''.",
        "Powers": "Once relatively common, these rare rings could teleport the wearer from their current location to a predetermined location on the same [[plane]] upon speaking a [[command word]] or through sheer force of will. However, [[Halaster]] cursed these rings to transport the wearer to a location of his choosing. To make matters worse, all of the equipment carried by the wearer, including the ''teleportation ring'', would be stripped from them during the teleportation and scattered throughout [[Undermountain]].\n\nThe command word for these rings was \"Athlas\", which meant \"lost\" in an ancient northern dialect.",
        "History": "These rings were placed throughout the ruins of Undermountain."
