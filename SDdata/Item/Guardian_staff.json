They possessed +1 and +2 enchantments that guided the wielders hands towards the targets and made attacks more deadly and, at the same time, granted magical protection to the wielder. They also slightly increased their spell damage and fortified their will and physique.\nSeveral of the guardian staves found use in the city of Neverwinter and the nearby Crags in the late 15 century DR."
