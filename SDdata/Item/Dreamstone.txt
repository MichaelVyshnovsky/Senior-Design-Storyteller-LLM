The '''''Dreamstone''''' was an ancient [[enchanted]] item created by the Church of [[Mystryl]] during the days of ancient [[Netheril]].

==Powers==
The ''Dreamstone'' possessed several powerful enchantments. The user of the item could cast several spells stored within. Casting ''[[cure light wounds]]'' expended a single charge, turning ''[[stone to flesh]]'' expended two charges, the spell of ''[[stonehold]]'' consumed four charges, and ''[[stoneskin]]'' was worth three. At the time of discovery, the ''Dreamstone'' held twelve charges. Sages also believed that the creator of the item imbued it with her unique spell that allowed the ''stone's'' owner to communicate with another through symbolism and imagery in their sleep. However, no one knew how to access this part of the ''Dreamstone's'' magic, and some even thought this to be a mere legend.

==History==
The ''Dreamstone'' was created by a [[priestess]] of Mystryl as a gift for the Church of [[Jannath]] in the days of the ancient empire of Netheril. The gift was an act of gratitude after clerics of Jannath aided the priestess named [[Dreamstone (priestess)|Dreamstone]] in the development of several powerful earth-related spells. Dreamstone named the magic item after herself and intended it to be used by the Church of Jannath as a powerful protective device.

By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the ''Dreamstone'' could be found either lost, discarded, or stolen from the clergy of Jannath by creatures of vile darkness only known as the [[Fragment of a Corrupt God|Fragments of a Corrupt God]]. The strange ancient shadow creatures were remnants of a long-forgotten evil god's power trapped in a lost temple deep in the [[Crab's Claw Coast]] caves on the [[Sword Coast]].
