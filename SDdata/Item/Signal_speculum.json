        "mainbody": "'''''Signal specula''''' were [[magic]]ally heated plates.",
        "Description": "A ''signal speculum'' was a metal plate that was on one side insulated and bare on the other. The bare side of the plate was heated with magic.",
        "Powers": "The metal plate was heated, so it looked like bright light to creatures who had [[infravision]]. Using this property, ''signal specula'' were used as signaling devices by creatures with such vision.\n\nThey were created by [[wizard]]s and [[cleric]]s but could be used by anybody.",
        "History": "''Signal specula'' were [[magic item]]s associated with the [[drow]]. They used it as signaling devices but also to treat chilled, wounded, or otherwise immobilized people with warmth, to warm drinks or limbs, or warm torn or cramped muscles."
