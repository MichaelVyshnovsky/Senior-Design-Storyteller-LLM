        "mainbody": "ignal specula were magically heated plates.\nA signal speculum was a metal plate that was on one side insulated and bare on the other. The bare side of the plate was heated with magic.\nThe metal plate was heated, so it looked like bright light to creatures who had infravision. Using this property, signal specula were used as signaling devices by creatures with such vision.\nThey were created by wizards and clerics but could be used by anybody.\nSignal specula were magic items associated with the drow. They used it as signaling devices but also to treat chilled, wounded, or otherwise immobilized people with warmth, to warm drinks or limbs, or warm torn or cramped muscles."
