        "Description": "These massive metal cylinders and plates were struck with large pieces of wood wrapped in protective cloth. Some storm bells were small enough to be carried in a cart pulled by oxen, but others were so large that they were permanent fixtures on buildings.",
        "History": "Though the modern cities of Zakhara used these items to draw crowds to important events or announcements, the historical purpose of a storm bell was to announce the coming of a deadly sandstorm out in the open desert. The sound of a storm bell rung clearly for miles, granting the desert tribes plenty of warning before an approaching sandstorm.\n\nStorm bells were also positioned along cliffs surrounding particularly deadly reefs to warn sailors of treacherous water."
