'''''Breastplates of silent moves''''' were sets of magically enchanted and well-oiled [[medium armor]] that allowed the wearer to move silently without suffering the negative effects of wearing bulky armor.

==Description==
''Breastplates of silent moves'' varied in appearance.

==Powers==
These sets of armor were specifically created to help the users of medium armor remain undetected, making as little sound as possible. The armor was well-oiled, making it significantly quieter than regular breastplates, and the magic enchantment on the sets dampened sound around it. The use of the ''breastplates of silent moves'' enhanced the owner's silent movement.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Kesefehon]], an elf commander of [[Myth Drannor]] wore his ''+2 breastplate of silent moves'' adorned with a [[wolf]] insignia in battle and was entombed with it. His set of armor was valued at 16,350 [[gp]].
