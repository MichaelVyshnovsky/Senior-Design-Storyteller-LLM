Jingasa was a type of helmet used in Kara-Tur.
The jingasa was a basic headgear worn by common soldiers. It was essentially an iron adaptation of the round straw hat traditionally worn by peasants. Unlike more elaborate helmets, the jingasa lacked protective guards for the ears, cheeks, and back of the neck. Nevertheless, its practicality was appreciated as it doubled as a makeshift cooking pot during military campaigns.
* Shugenja were known to wear jingasa.
