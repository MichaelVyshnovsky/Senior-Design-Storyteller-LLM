        "mainbody": "'''Iomic crystal''' was a purple crystal found on the island of [[Ioma]] in the [[Nelanther Isles]].",
        "Descriptions": "These crystals came in a variety of shapes and sizes, but largely resembled [[amethyst]]s in appearance. They had a peculiar structure that made them well-suited for holding and releasing [[psionic]] energy, though this was largely unknown.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Crystal Clear|4}}",
        "Price": "The value of these crystals was comparable to that of [[quartz]].",
        "History": "After the [[Spellplague]], the mineral was believed to have anti-[[magic]] properties, protecting against the various afflictions and [[curse]]s brought aboutbby the Spellplague. This led the [[Amn]]ians occupying Ioma to mine the substance and turn it into [[amulet]]s to ward off [[wild magic]]. It was eventually discovered by reputable scholars and [[wizard]]s that the iomic crystals actually had no special properties. Despite this, the Amnians continued to mine and sell the stones. Sometimes passing them off as amethysts, and in other cases selling them as bracelets or charms to the poor and less-educated folk of the Realms who were unaware of their status as snake oil.\n\nAt some point the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] discovered the psionic properties of iomic crystals and began to conduct experiments with them. One of these involved months of infusing specially-treated groups of Iomic crystals with a variant of the aboleth curse. After much careful testing and refining, they sought a much wider test and stole a large shipment of the crystals that was bound for [[Athkatla]]. Once imbued with the aboleth curse, these iomic crystals were sold in Athkatla's low market by a merchant named [[Ormust]].",
        "Notable Users": "* Various folk remedies utilizing ground up ionic crystals claimed that they could perform miracle cures or remove curses."
