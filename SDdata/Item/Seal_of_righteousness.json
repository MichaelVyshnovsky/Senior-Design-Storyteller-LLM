        "mainbody": "The '''''seal of righteousness''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] trinket crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Nayeli Goldflower]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"[[Silverhand gear]]\" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Description": "The ''seal of righteousness'' was a precious medallion inlaid with unusually sharp [[gemstone]]s, which required Nayeli to handle it with care and respect. According to Silverhand, this was intended to draw a parallel with how Nayeli had to pay similarly close attention to her behavior and oath as a [[paladin]].",
        "Powers": "While the ''seal of righteousness'' was in her possession, Nayeli had good fortune in combat.",
        "Notable Owners": "* Nayeli Goldflower, a paladin of [[Tyr]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[halberd of swift admonition]]''."
