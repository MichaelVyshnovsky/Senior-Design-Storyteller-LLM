A chill blade was a magical dagger.
When active, the blade glowed a pale and ghostly white.
When activated at the bearers will the dagger dealt extra damage to a target. Furthermore, if they couldnt resist the spell, the targets ability to attack was hampered for a full hour. The more times they were struck, the more hampered they were.
The blade did less damage against the undead, but could turn them, forcing them to flee temporarily.
A chill blade was resistant to cold.
These blades could be created from a well-made ferrous-bladed dagger, a snowflake or chunk of ice, a chill touch spell, lightning or electrical discharge of some kind, and a piece of rock crystal. As of 1368 DR, chill blades were worth around 1,000 gold pieces.
