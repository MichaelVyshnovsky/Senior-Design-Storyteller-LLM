'''Bustards''' was a complex but heavenly delicious dish, according to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], that was cooked with freshly-caught [[ground quail]]s of the [[Evermoors]]. The restaurant of note that served bustards was the [[Maid of the Moors]] of [[Mornbryn's Shield]].

==Description==
Bustards usually included two birds on a platter with various garnishes, but the preparation of the dish was noteworthy.

The first step of the dish's preparation was butchering fresh quails, removed heads, guts, and claws. The birds then were smothered in [[clay]] and baked on the open fire until the clay hardened. The clay coverings then were cracked and peeled off along with the feathers. The birds then were transferred into covered [[pot]]s, placed in a hot freshly made [[gravy]] of quail [[egg]]s, [[beef]] fat, stock from steamed [[cabbage]], and [[asparagus]] (both grew in abundance in the moors), with [[flour]] added as a thickener. The birds were slowly cooked in this silky sauce.

When cooked, bustards were served in the resulting thick gravy, with fried [[flatbread|flatbreads]] for dipping.
