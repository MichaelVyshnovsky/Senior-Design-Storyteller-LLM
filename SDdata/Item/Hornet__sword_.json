        "mainbody": "'''''Hornet''''' was a unique ''[[sword of dancing|short sword of dancing]]'' that was wielded by the [[avatar]] of [[Arvoreen]] alongside his favored [[weapon]], ''[[Aegisheart]]''.",
        "Powers": "''Hornet'' was a ''+4'' short sword of dancing. However, this was no typical blade of this type, as when dancing, the blade hit much harder, and this scaled with the strength of the wielder. As per ''Aegisheart'', Arvoreen was able to transform this ''Hornet'' into another form via ''[[weapon shift]]''."
