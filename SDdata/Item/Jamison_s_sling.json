        "mainbody": "'''''Jamison's sling''''' was a powerful enchanted [[sling]] that belonged to the hero named [[Harl Jamison]] of the [[Sons of Green Hills]], sometime before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The sling was ensorcelled with a ''+4'' enchantment to make it significantly easier to hit its targets and hit them hard.",
        "History": "''Jamison's sling'' was a rather simple name given to the magic sling wielded by the powerful [[gnome]] hero Harl Jamison during his adventuring days with the troupe called the Sons of Green Hills. In his hands, the sling ended the lives of many [[ogre]]s and [[goblin]]s in defense of the group's homelands. The sling was interred with Harl Jamison after his death of old age in the {{YearlinkName|845}}. It was believed that the sling was plundered from the hero's grave sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|890}}, and by the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, it ended up in the hands of a [[Kieran Nye]], a disgraced member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who posed as the simple innkeeper and the owner of the [[Whistling Gallows]] in the town of [[Lonelywood]]."
