        "mainbody": "east Day Cheese Bake was a comfort food dish made with cheese, vegetables, and pasta, found in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn in the late 15 century DR.\nThe dish consisted of two recipes, one for the filling and the second one for the sauce. The filling was made using one diced onion, quartered mushrooms, diced red pepper, a generous heaping of greens (spinach, peas, courgette, or anything else in season), and diced and fried bacon or chorizo. Lastly, the recipe called for a generous amount of boiled pasta.\nThe sauce was made with butter, flour, Cormyte mustard, milk, aged cheddar, and a fistful of breadcrumbs.\nThe cook was to cook onions in oil until softened, adding peppers and mushrooms in and sautéing them together, later stirring in meat and greens, while a pot of pasta was being boiled. Then, the sauce was made by melting butter in a saucepan and mixing with flour for one minute whilst on high flame. Next, the milk was whisked into the butter as well as grated cheese. When the pasta was cooked, it was strained and mixed into the cheese sauce alongside cooked vegetables and meat. The entire mass was then placed in a square stoneware dish with a floral pattern and baked, topped with breadcrumbs and more cheese. The dish was cooked until the top was golden and bubbling.\nEmmeline Hallowleaf suggested that unsalted pasta water could be bused to feed plants in ones garden.\nIn the , the recipe for Feast Day Cheese Bake was known to Emmeline Hallowleaf, the mother of Shadowheart, one of the Absolute Adversaries. She may have had shared the recipe with her daughter following the conclusion of the Absolute crisis in Baldurs Gate."
