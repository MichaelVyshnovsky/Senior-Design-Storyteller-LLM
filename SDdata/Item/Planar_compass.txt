'''''Planar compasses''''' were magical navigational tools that pointed in the direction of the nearest way to a particular [[plane]], allowing users to locate interplanar [[portal|gate]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/Another Serious Matter|5,19}}

==Description==
Despite their name, these devices did not resemble mundane [[compass]]es, but rather were [[iron]] spheres measuring {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} in diameter. They were designed to be easily separated into two halves, revealing a hollow cavity that measured {{SI|4|in|long=yes}} in diameter, and equally rejoined with ease.

==Powers==
After placing an object within the hollow cavity of a ''planar compass'' and rejoining its two halves, the instrument would proceed to spin around until eventually stopping, with a small arrow jutting out from one of its halves. This arrow pointed towards the direction of the nearest pathway to the [[plane]] from which the item originated, whether it be a gate, [[astral conduit]], or [[elemental vortex]]. This effect remained active, the ''planar compass'' pointing unerringly, until either the device entered the planar destination or the object placed within it was removed.

==History==
Around the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] came into possession of ''planar compasses''.{{Cite organized play/LC/Into the Depths|24}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Messengers|3,13}} One of the first was a group tasked by either [[Alcides Von Tighe]] or [[Simon Regulus]] with delivering a ''planar compass'', secured within a magical lockbox, to the [[githzerai]] sage [[A'Rinthorm]] as a substance held within it would aid in the sage's studies. Much later, another group had a compass offered to them in return for 5,000 [[gold piece]]s by [[Bob Nuhard|Bob]] and [[Susan Nuhard]], proprietors of the [[Gates of Hell Inn]] in the city of [[Dis]]. And finally, a group of adventurers were loaned a ''planar compass'' by the [[ruvkova]] [[Kharn]] after providing him [[positive energy]], promising it would help lead them to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum]].
