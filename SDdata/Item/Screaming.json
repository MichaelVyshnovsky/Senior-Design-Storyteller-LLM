        "Description": "When active, the weapon made a low and irritating humming noise. It changed to a painful screaming when it struck a target.",
        "Powers": "It inflicted [[sonic]] damage, even within the area of a ''[[silence]]'' spell. It had no special effect on creatures with enhanced hearing, but it was especially annoying to them.\n\nIf it was applied to ranged weapons, the effects applied to their ammunition.",
        "Creation": "It required a ''[[shout]]'' or ''[[sound burst]]'' spell to enchant a ''screaming'' weapon."
