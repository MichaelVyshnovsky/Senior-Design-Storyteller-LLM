They could also be used to communicate with the elven homeland. The magic of these items would only work for the specific person to whom they were gifted.\nQueen Amlaruil Moonflower gave these tokens to her allies in Faer√ªn. Both Mirt the Moneylender and Carreigh Macumail were known to have possessed an elfrune at one time."
