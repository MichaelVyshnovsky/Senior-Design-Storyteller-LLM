This equipment could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe blade of the warriors duo hit harder than a mundane blade, and when it hit particularly hard, the duo released protective magic that bolstered the defenses of not only the wielder but their allies as well.\n* Tommus Tallstep, a halfling fighter who worked as an adventurer on behalf of Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep, during the late 15 century DR."
