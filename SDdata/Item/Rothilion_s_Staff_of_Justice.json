        "mainbody": "'''''Rothilion's Staff of Justice''''' was the enchanted [[staff]] that belonged to [[Rothilion]] the Honorable, Wizard and Judge of [[Myth Drannor]], that served him in life and was [[Crypt of Rothilion|entombed]] with his body after his death.",
        "Description": "''Rothilion's Staff of Justice'' appeared to be a simple wooden, although masterfully crafted, quarterstaff.",
        "Powers": "The staff's owner was granted the ability to cast a set of spells: ''[[light]]'' (1 charge), ''[[magic missile]]'' (5 missiles), ''[[see invisibility]]'' (1 charge), and ''[[dimension door]]'' (2 charges).\n\nAny evil creature that attempted to use ''Rothilion's Staff of Justice'' was punished by being weakening and drained of life experience as long as the creature was holding the staff. That magical punishment was not curable by any means, including ''[[restoration]]'' spells.",
        "Crafting": "A staff of similar power and abilities could be created by a skilled staff crafter, using the ''dimension door'', ''magic missile'', ''see invisibility'' spells.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Rothilion's Staff of Justice'' was still with his body inside of his crypt in the [[Polyandrium]] of Myth Drannor. The staff was protected by the defensive enchantments placed on the crypt and the coffin itself. The tomb was enchanted with the ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell and trapped any creature touching it with the ''[[dimensional anchor]]''."
