        "mainbody": "othilions Staff of Justice was the enchanted staff that belonged to Rothilion the Honorable, Wizard and Judge of Myth Drannor, that served him in life and was entombed with his body after his death.\nRothilions Staff of Justice appeared to be a simple wooden, although masterfully crafted, quarterstaff.\nThe staffs owner was granted the ability to cast a set of spells light (1 charge), magic missile (5 missiles), see invisibility (1 charge), and dimension door (2 charges).\nAny evil creature that attempted to use Rothilions Staff of Justice was punished by being weakening and drained of life experience as long as the creature was holding the staff. That magical punishment was not curable by any means, including restoration spells.\nA staff of similar power and abilities could be created by a skilled staff crafter, using the dimension door, magic missile, see invisibility spells.\nIn 1369 DR, Rothilions Staff of Justice was still with his body inside of his crypt in the Polyandrium of Myth Drannor. The staff was protected by the defensive enchantments placed on the crypt and the coffin itself. The tomb was enchanted with the protection from evil spell and trapped any creature touching it with the dimensional anchor."
