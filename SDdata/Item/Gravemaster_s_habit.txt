Gravemasters habit was an enchanted robe to be used by a lich, designed sometime before the late 15 century DR.
Gravemasters habits were thoroughly enchanted and intricately sown to be the most prized possessions of Thayan liches. These robes boosted the wearers vitality, increased their defense, aim, and strengthened their life-stealing magics. When in battle, the robe ensured the wearer could easily land the most critical and lucky of attacks within the first two minutes.
In the late 15 century DR, the Red Wizards of Thay dispatched agents to the Jungles of Chult as the dangerous death curse began spreading across Faer√ªn. Gravemasters habit was one of the rare pieces of enchanted gear brought to Chult by Szass Tams mages and his undead servants.
