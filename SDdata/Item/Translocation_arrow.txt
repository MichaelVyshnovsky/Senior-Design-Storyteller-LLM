'''''Translocation arrows''''', also known as '''''arrows of transposition,''''' were extremely rare types of enchanted ammunition, almost never found in bulk.

==Description==
Usually, ''translocation arrows'' appeared to be regular well-crafted [[arrow]]s with a green crystal attached to the arrow's shaft, right at the arrowhead. Even when they were kept in quivers, some users could swear their ''translocation arrows'' constantly switched places with one another.

==Powers==
''Translocation arrows'' were imbued with potentially dangerous magics. When used as regular weapons, they dealt minuscule damage to their targets. However, their purpose was not offensive, but utilitarian or strategic. Upon a successful hit, ''translocation arrows'' ''[[blink]]ed'' the shooter to the arrow's target. When used in combat, these arrows could be wielded by warriors handy with [[bow]]s. They shot the arrow to instantly be transported into melee fighting range.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, several of these rare arrows could be found in [[Lonelywood]] and the wider [[Ten Towns]] area of [[Icewind Dale]]. And by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''arrows of transposition'' were known to see use in the [[Western Heartlands]] and in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. Some of their notable users were [[Harper]] quartermaster [[Talli]] who served under the [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]], a [[tiefling]] refugee smith [[Dammon]], and the [[deep gnome]] named [[Barcus Wroot]], all in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
