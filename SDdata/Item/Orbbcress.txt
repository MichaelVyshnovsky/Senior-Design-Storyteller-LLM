Orbbcress (or Spiderweb) was a shield belonging to Tiago Baenre.
The shield had grips formed like black spiders with blue sapphire eyes. It was made of glassteel.
The shield could defeat some magical energy. It could also magically enlarge, spinning around to cover a larger area.
Tiago was able to attach the shield to a surface and hang from it (although perhaps only for a short time).
The legendary weaponsmith Golfanin forged Orbbcress in Gauntlgrym for Tiago in 1463 DR.
Following a duel with Drizzt DoUrden that resulted in Tiagos death, Drizzt obtained Tiagos sword, Vidrinath, and shield, Orbbcress. Catti-brie combined both Bruenors foaming-mug shield with Orbbcress using the magic of a primordial, with the resulting shield keeping the ability to produce dwarven holy water and Orbbcresss magical enchantments.
