'''''Orbbcress''''' (or '''''Spiderweb''''') was a shield belonging to [[Tiago Baenre]].

==Description==
The shield had grips formed like black spiders with blue [[sapphire]] eyes. It was made of [[glassteel]].

==Abilities==
The shield could defeat some magical energy. It could also magically enlarge, spinning around to cover a larger area.

Tiago was able to attach the shield to a surface and hang from it (although perhaps only for a short time).

==History==
The legendary weaponsmith [[Gol'fanin]] forged ''Orbbcress'' in [[Gauntlgrym]] for Tiago in [[1463 DR]].

Following a duel with [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] that resulted in Tiago's death, Drizzt obtained Tiago's sword, ''Vidrinath'', and shield, ''Orbbcress''. [[Catti-brie]] combined both [[Bruenor]]'s foaming-mug shield with ''Orbbcress'' using the magic of a [[primordial]], with the resulting shield keeping the ability to produce [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[holy water]] and ''Orbbcress'''s magical enchantments.<ref>
