Sahandrian was an enchanted longsword wielded by Corellons avatar.
Sahandrian was a powerfully enchanted longsword that caused immense pain for anyone attempting to hold the blade aside from Corellon. The effect was even more severe for any goblinoids.
In the legendary conflict between Gruumsh and Corellon, Sahandrian was destroyed by Gruumsh with the help of Corellons wife, Araushnee, as one of the first acts of Araushnees betrayal. It was later restored by Sehanine Moonbow. # Elaine Cunningham (1999). Evermeet Island of Elves. (Wizards of the Coast), pp. 19â€“28. ISBN 0-7869-1354-1.
