        "mainbody": "'''''Daern's instant fortress''''', commonly known as an '''''instant fortress''''', was a type of [[magic item]] that allowed the owner to summon a nigh-impregnable fortress made of [[adamantine]].",
        "Description": "When inactive, an ''instant fortress'' appeared to be a small cube that was {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}} on each side.",
        "Powers": "By placing the cube on the ground and speaking a [[command word]], the ''instant fortress'' rapidly grew from a small cube into a square fortress {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} on each side with adamantine walls that were {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} high and which extended a further {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} into the ground, thus making the fortress very sturdy even before the enchantment ensuring that it was impossible to tip over. The walls all had arrow slits and were topped with either [[Wikipedia:Battlement|crenellated]], [[Wikipedia:Machicolation|machicolated]], or closed battlements. The enchanted adamantine structure was resistant to most forms of [[magical]] damage and was impervious to attacks by normal weapons, although it could be damaged by [[catapult]]s or other [[:Category:Siege weapons|siege weapons]]. An ''instant fortress'' could not be repaired by any normal means, and accumulated damage had to be removed with ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[miracle]]'' spells (which could only repair some of the fortress per casting, thus requiring the caster to specify which part of the fortress they intended to repair).\n\nThe rapid growth of an ''instant fortress''&mdash;with one reaching full size in anywhere between six and could only be returned to its small metal cube state by using a command word to dismiss it from the outside. This command was usually different than the word used to activate it in the first place, and would not work unless the fortress was empty.\n\nThe interior of the ''instant fortress'' was accessible through a small door that always appeared on the wall facing the item's owner when the fortress arose. and was not insulated, meaning that aside from blocking out the wind, it was the same temperature inside as outside.",
        "History": "Beginning in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a functionally permanent ''instant fortress'' was erected in a low cavern—so low that the tower had crashed through the ceiling—in the [[Northdark]] northwest of [[Blingdenstone]]. This place was known as [[Fendlestick's Folly]], named for the [[human]] [[wizard]] who chose the ill-fitting place for his fortress before being killed and taking the command words with him to the grave.\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, crafting an ''instant fortress'' required access to the spell ''[[Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion]]''.\n\nThe properties of the ''instant fortress'' changed somewhat during the era of the [[Spellplague]]. For example, it could only be activated once per day, and it would refuse to grow to full size if it there were obstacles in its intended footprint. It could also be dismissed while people were inside of it, and they would be harmlessly shunted out of the fortress as it shrunk. In addition, the walls were said to be even more invincible; however, the small door was less secure and could be forced open. Following the [[Second Sundering]], the properties were once again the same as they had been prior to the Spellplague.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, a wizard erected an ''instant fortress'' within a region of the Northdark known as the [[Labyrinth]], but she was subsequently slain by [[shadow demon]]s. Her [[demon]]-haunted fortress came to be known as the [[Adamantine Tower]].",
        "Reputation": "''Instant fortresses'' were rare items that were particularly valued by [[adventurer]]s and the like who traveled in dangerous environs. They could easily withstand hurricane- or tornado-force winds.\n\nThe ancient [[Netherese]] ''[[fortressmantle]]'' was an enchanted [[cloak]] that could create a structure similar to a double-strength ''instant fortress'' by pulling the hood over one's head.\n\nThe powers of the rook from the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' were the same as those of an ''instant fortress'', except that it could repair itself between uses.\n\nThe [[archdevil]] [[Malphas]] of [[Avernus]] was innately able to summon a temporary fortress similar to an ''instant fortress'', except that the door was not beholden to only his command.{{Cite dragon/75/The Nine Hells|20}}",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Brister Fendlestick]], who erected his ''instant fortress'' in the [[Underdark]] and was killed in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Jarlaxle]], the leader of [[Bregan D'aerthe]], possessed a special type of ''instant fortress'', known as ''[[Caer Gromph]]'', which resembled a giant stalagmite and which could be shrunk to its portable cube size with soldiers hidden inside of it.\n* [[Joppa]], an [[Oerth]]ian [[monk]] active around [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Kardhel Terov]], a [[Warlock Knight]] of [[Vaasa]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, who used it to house himself and his entourage while traveling.\n* The [[Doomguard]] of [[Sigil]] were said to use ''instant fortresses'' when traveling to the [[Abyss]], such as in [[Twelvetrees]]."
