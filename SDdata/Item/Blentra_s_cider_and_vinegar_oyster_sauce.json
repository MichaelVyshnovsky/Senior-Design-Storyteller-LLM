        "mainbody": "'''Blentra's cider and vinegar oyster sauce''' was a seafood sauce made at the [[Platter of Plenty]] in [[Marsember]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was attributed to [[Blentra Whaelbuckler]].",
        "Description": "A serving of sauce was sufficient to smother a large meal of raw [[oyster]]s, enough to feed a very hungry patron. It started with a large, tart greenheart [[apple]] being peeled and diced, then mashed and mixed with a spoonful of crushed black [[pepper]], a pinch of dried [[mustard]], and a half-cup of of red-[[wine]] [[vinegar]]. A handful of [[shallot]]s or [[scallion]]s were then minced and mixed in, along with a half-cup of apple [[cider]] and finally a pour of [[zzar]] or [[almond]] [[sherry]]. The mixture was then chilled for an hour and then stirred before being spooned onto the chilled, raw, half-shell oysters.",
        "Availability": "The sauce was made in large cauldrons by low-ranking kitchen staff at the Platter of Plenty, alongside a multitude of other sauces that doused the meals of the Platter."
