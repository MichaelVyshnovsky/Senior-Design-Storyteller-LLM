        "mainbody": "lentras cider and vinegar oyster sauce was a seafood sauce made at the Platter of Plenty in Marsember in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was attributed to Blentra Whaelbuckler.\nA serving of sauce was sufficient to smother a large meal of raw oysters, enough to feed a very hungry patron. It started with a large, tart greenheart apple being peeled and diced, then mashed and mixed with a spoonful of crushed black pepper, a pinch of dried mustard, and a half-cup of of red-wine vinegar. A handful of shallots or scallions were then minced and mixed in, along with a half-cup of apple cider and finally a pour of zzar or almond sherry. The mixture was then chilled for an hour and then stirred before being spooned onto the chilled, raw, half-shell oysters.\nThe sauce was made in large cauldrons by low-ranking kitchen staff at the Platter of Plenty, alongside a multitude of other sauces that doused the meals of the Platter."
