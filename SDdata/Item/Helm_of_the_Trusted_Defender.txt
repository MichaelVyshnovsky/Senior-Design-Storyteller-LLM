The Helm of the Trusted Defender was an enchanted helmet designed to be worn only by halflings and gnomes.
This helmet not only protected the wearers head, increasing their defense, it also possessed enchantments that shielded the wearer from fatigue and removed the need to sleep, as well as made them immune to magical compulsion or sleep spell.
The helm of the Trusted Defender was created circa 881 DR in a little-known halfling and gnome town of Shepherds Valley. The communitys watch captain wore the helmet with it being handed from the captain in charge of the Night Watch to the captain helming the Day Watch. And at dusk, the helm was passed along to the Night Watchmen once again. This continued until Pheldon Tock, one of the Night Watch captains, traded the item to the Gibling Armstrongs Curious Shoppe. Eventually, the helm of the Trusted Defender was purchased from the store by a bored dwarf who used it as a mantlepiece at a land far away from Shepherds Valley.
By 1281 DR, the helm of the Trusted Defender found its way into the stock of Conlans Smithy in Kuldahar in Icewind Dale.
