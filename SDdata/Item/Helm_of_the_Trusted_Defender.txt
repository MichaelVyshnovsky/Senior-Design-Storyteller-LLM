The '''''Helm of the Trusted Defender''''' was an enchanted [[helmet]] designed to be worn only by [[halfling]]s and [[gnome]]s.

==Powers==
This helmet not only protected the wearer's head, increasing their defense, it also possessed enchantments that shielded the wearer from fatigue and removed the need to sleep, as well as made them immune to magical compulsion or ''[[sleep]]'' spell.

==History==
The ''helm of the Trusted Defender'' was created ''circa'' [[881 DR]] in a little-known halfling and gnome town of [[Shepherd's Valley]]. The community's watch captain wore the helmet with it being handed from the captain in charge of the Night Watch to the captain helming the Day Watch. And at dusk, the helm was passed along to the Night Watchmen once again. This continued until [[Pheldon Tock]], one of the Night Watch captains, traded the item to the [[Gibling Armstrong's Curious Shoppe]]. Eventually, the ''helm of the Trusted Defender'' was purchased from the store by a bored [[dwarf]] who used it as a mantlepiece at a land far away from Shepherd's Valley.

By [[1281 DR]], the ''helm of the Trusted Defender'' found its way into the stock of ''[[Conlan's Smithy]]'' in [[Kuldahar]] in [[Icewind Dale]].
