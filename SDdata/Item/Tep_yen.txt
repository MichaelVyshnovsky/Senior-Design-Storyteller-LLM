'''Tep yen''' was a variety of spice found in the Realms.{{cite book/Sentinelspire||9}}

==Description==
Though its composition was not public knowledge, [[Berun]], a [[druid]] of the [[Shalhoond]], took it to be the crushed seeds of some plant. He kept it in containers not made from leather, such as glass, clay, or bone. It was extremely spicy, or "hot", and very painful when it got into the eyes.

==Availability==
It was sold in [[Almorel]] in the [[Hordelands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Berun blew some of his own stash in the eyes of two [[assassins]] holding him captive on the night of [[Tarsakh 15]] of {{yearlink|1374}} as part of his escape.
