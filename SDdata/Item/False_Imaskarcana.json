        "mainbody": "The '''''False Imaskarcana''''' were a collection of seven [[artifact]]s created before the collapse of the ancient [[Imaskar Empire]]. By their name, they were associated with the genuine ''[[Imaskarcana]]'', seven artifacts that recorded the empire's knowledge of [[magic]].\n\nOne of the ''False Imaskarcana'' was ''[[Dhonas's Shroud]]''.{{Cite dragon/281/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Imaskarcana: Faces of Magic}}<ref group=\"note\">While the nature of the ''False Imaskarcana'' is unknown, but it may be assumed that if ''Dhonas' Shroud'' is amongst them, so are its sister artifacts: all of them were shown as the ''Imaskarcana'' in dragon magazine before [[Lost Empires of Faer√ªn]] and [[Underdark (sourcebook)]] began revealing the actual ''Imaskarcana'' slowly. [[The Grand History of the Realms]] names ''Dhonas' Shroud'' as a false Imaskarcana, while showing the actual origin of the ''Imaskarcana''.\n\nAfter the empire's fall, in {{Yearlink|-2487}}, the surviving artificer [[Kujawa]] carried ''Dhonas's Shroud'' and claimed the Dragon Throne in the [[Khati]] city of [[Saikhoi|Thakos]], the former capital of Upper Imaskar. With that, he declared himself Emperor and founded a new realm, [[Anok-Imaskar]]."
