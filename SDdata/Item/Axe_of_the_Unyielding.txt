The '''''Axe of the Unyielding''''' was a powerful [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[battleaxe]].

==Powers==
The axe possessed a ''+3 enchantment'' and conveyed several boons upon its wielder. It both enhanced their natural defenses, and gave them a form of [[regeneration]].

==History==
At one point the ''Axe of the Unyielding'' was in the possession of [[Glimred Heavyhand]], an elder [[dwarf]] who was considered to be a hero among his people. Some time after Glimred disappeared beneath the [[Marching Mountains]], the weapon came into the possession of the [[minotaur]] called [[Rock (minotaur)|Rock]].

==Rumors & Legends==
According to the [[imp]] [[Cespenar]], the ''Axe of the Unyielding'' could be further improved by a skilled and knowledgeable smith who happened to have the claw of a [[balor]] on hand.
