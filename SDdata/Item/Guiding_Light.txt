Guiding Light was a magic ring that belonged to the cleric of Mystra L. De Hurst, the resident mistress of the Arcane Tower.
The ring had the power to reflect light even if there was no available source.
It was used by its original owner as a key to access their secret study in the basement of the Arcane Tower.
De Hurst wore Guiding Light during her travels into the Underdark during the 1480s DR.
