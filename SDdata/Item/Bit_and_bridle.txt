A '''bit and bridle''' was an essential piece of tack, consisting of a mouthpiece and a head harness to control a mount.<ref group="note">Though bits and bridles can be considered separate items, they are almost always paired together within the Forgotten Realms and related settings.

|Any [[horse]]man will tell you that the difference between a good bit and bridle and a poor one is a stiff neck, an aching back, and a bad temper.

==Description==
These coupled items were often essential for riding mounts, particularly [[horse]]s. The bridle was a large set of leather straps or a [[rope]] set around a mount's lower jaw. Bits came in many types. A bit could be inserted into a horse's mouth and attached to the bridle.

Bits and bridles were sold all over [[Faer√ªn]], [[Zakhara]], ''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'' sold bits and bridles, and were suitable for those embarking on a lengthy journey or participating in a race.

The ''[[phantom steed]]'' spell summoned a spectral mount with both bit and bridle and a [[saddle]].

==History==
When the beloved [[Zakharan]] [[horse]], [[Edimu]], passed from the world, a mausoleum was constructed for him in [[Sokkar]]. Edimu's [[gold]]en bit and bridle were buried alongside him. However, [[ghoul]]s later looted the chambers, stealing the valuable [[gem]]-studded bit and bridle and breaking the [[ka figure]] it rested upon, thus bringing Edimu's [[spirit]] back from the afterlife. In [[1367 DR]], the legendary spirit horse asked a group of adventurers to recover his bit and bridle. The heroes were successful in their task, and Edimu's spirit was finally laid to rest.

==Notable Bits and Bridles==
