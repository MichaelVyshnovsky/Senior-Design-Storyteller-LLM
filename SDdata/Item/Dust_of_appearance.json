        "mainbody": "'''''Dust of appearance''''' was an [[enchanted]] powder capable of revealing invisible objects.",
        "Powers": "When thrown into the air, this fine metallic powder would coat everything, revealing all hidden objects, including those that were invisible, out of phase, ethereal, etc. The dust also revealed ''[[mirror image]]s'' and ''[[project image|projected images]]'' for their true nature. The effects of items such as a ''[[cloak of displacement]]'' or ''[[Robe of blending (warning 3-speed)|robe of blending]]'' were negated as well. The dust worked to reveal both living and nonliving things, lasting for 2â€“20 minutes.\n\n''Dust of appearance'' was stored in hollow bone blow tubes within a pouch or in small packets made of [[silk]]. Each tube represented a single use, covering a {{SI|10|ft}} radius when thrown. The dust would cover a cone area measuring {{SI|1|ft}} at the base by {{SI|20|ft}} long and {{SI|15|ft}} wide at the end if blown from the tube.",
