'''Surcoats''' were a type of loose-fitting outer garment worn, for the purpose of staying warm, by [[humanoid]] races overtop of either a cote or [[tunic]].

==Description==
Surcoats came in a variety of styles. Variations included having sleeves, hoods, [[cape]]s, or a combination of the three. or [[samite]]. Surcoats that were of a white hue were noted as being able to minimize the body's absorption of exterior heat.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-16 - What the Waterdhavian Guard Wears in the Summer}}

==Availability==
* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold linen surcoats for a price of 6 [[silver piece]]s and quilted ones for a price of 2 [[gold piece]]s. At a cost of 20 gold pieces they offered a unique variety of hooded surcoat, designed for arctic environments, that they called a "peltcote". Peltcotes reached to below the knees, were made of two layers of quilted [[wool]], lined with fur, lined with pockets and hasps, and came with a [[belt]] for tools.
