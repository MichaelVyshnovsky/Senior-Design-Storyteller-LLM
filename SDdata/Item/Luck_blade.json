        "mainbody": "A '''''luck blade''''' (or '''''luckblade''''') was a powerful [[magic item|magical]] [[sword]] that increased its wearer's luck by granting a number of benefits.",
        "Description": "Any type of sword could be enchanted to become a ''luck blade''. However, [[shortsword]]s were more common in the pre-[[Spellplague]] period.",
        "Powers": "The wielder of a ''luck blade'' enjoyed a number of magical benefits. The blade itself was enchanted to improve its accuracy in combat and conferred an improved resistance to general detrimental effects and misfortunes, magical or otherwise.\n\nAdditionally, the blade granted its wielder with the power of good fortune, giving them the ability to turn one immediate bad turn of events into a good one, once per day. The sword regained this ability in the following dawn.\n\nFinally, a ''luck blade'' was granted with up to three uses of the ''[[wish]]'' [[spell]], each of which could also be cast only once a day. Once all the uses were expended, the sword could no longer provide new ''wishes'', but all its other enhancements remained.",
        "Notable Owners": "*[[Artus Cimber]] had a ''luck blade'' in his possessions in the late 1480s [[DR]], during travels with [[Dragonbait]] in [[Chult]].{{Template:Cite game/Tales from Candlekeep: Tomb of Annihilation}}\n*[[Meredin Sandyfoot]], the [[hin]] guildmaster from the [[Rock of Bral]] in the 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|82|Meredin's Short Sword +1 Luck Blade}}\n*[[Mirt]] the Moneylender owned a ''luck blade''.
