Gold dragon armor were sets of heavy armor crafted out of scales and hides of gold dragons. Because of benevolent nature of gold wyrms, these armors were significantly rarer than similar sets crafted out of evil chromatic dragons.
Gold dragon armor possessed a powerful +6 enchantment and granted the wearer resistance to normal and magical fire. As these armors were crafted out of dragon scales, they were significantly lighter than other sets of heavy armor.
As of 1373 DR, a set of gold dragon armor could be found in a treasure hoard of Iyrauroth, the Wyrm of the Peaks. Because of natural antipathy between gold and black dragons, it was believed that Iyrauroth had a hand in creation of this set of enchanted armor.
