'''''Gold dragon armor''''' were sets of [[heavy armor]] crafted out of scales and hides of [[gold dragon]]s. Because of benevolent nature of gold wyrms, these armors were significantly rarer than similar sets crafted out of evil [[chromatic dragon]]s.

==Powers==
''Gold dragon armor'' possessed a powerful ''+6'' enchantment and granted the wearer resistance to normal and magical fire. As these armors were crafted out of [[dragon]] scales, they were significantly lighter than other sets of heavy armor.

==History==
As of [[1373 DR]], a set of ''gold dragon armor'' could be found in a treasure hoard of [[Iyrauroth]], the Wyrm of the Peaks. Because of natural antipathy between gold and [[black dragon]]s, it was believed that Iyrauroth had a hand in creation of this set of enchanted armor.
