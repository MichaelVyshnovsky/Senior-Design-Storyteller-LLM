        "mainbody": "'''Taco''' was a type of food found among the diasporas of the [[Radiant Citadel]], floating within the [[Astral Sea]]. A variety of the same dish found in various places in [[Faerûn]] were known by several names: '''fryhard''' along the [[Sword Coast]], '''crunchtart''' in the [[Vilhon Reach]], '''hotbite''' in [[South Faerûn]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-11-13 - Tacos}}",
        "Description": "Fryhards found in Faerûn were fried hardcrust thin and flat round[[bread]]s made with [[corn]]. A variety of fillings existed, with mince-meats ([[lamb]], [[rabbit]], [[squirrel]]) and hot-[[spice]]d vegetables, such as fried [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es, [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[leek]]s, [[artichoke]]s, [[radish]]es, [[fungi]], and [[asparagus]] being the most common. [[Cheese]]-drenched tacos were a special variety available in most places. Crunchtarts in the Vilhon Reach and realms south of the [[Shaar]] were traditionally covered in sauces.",
        "History": "The foods were born somewhere in [[South Faerûn]], from where it spread via trade routes to [[Chessenta]], the Vilhon Reach, and traveled in a changed form to the Sword Coast, [[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], the [[Lake of Steam]], and [[Tethyr]], where they quickly became a popular new tavern food."
