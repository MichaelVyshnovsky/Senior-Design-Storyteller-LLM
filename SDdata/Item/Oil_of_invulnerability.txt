Oil of invulnerability was a magical substance that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.
This oil had a strong scent of burnt almonds.
When spread on a surface, this wonderful oil protected the surface from damage for 1â€“2 hours.
