Cable was a term describing several distinct manufactured products, similar to common rope, though on occasion was confusingly also used to refer to common rope.
The most common use of cable referred to immensely thick and strong ropes, such as thigh-thick hawsers used for mooring and anchoring large ships or the lines used to support the movements of massive mechanisms.
A less common form of cable found in the Realms was a thinner, lighter construction made of a thick twisted wire with rope woven around it. It was extremely strong for its weight, able to hold surprising amounts of weight, and highly resistant to cutting thanks to the core.
A rare form of cable was wholly made of metal or another material, without including any woven rope.
* Tantras was a center of rope production, and thick hawser cables could be had for 150 gp per  (this was the exorbitant price set by shops when a ship cable was required immediately in emergency, rather than ordered normally).
* Urcandle Alley in Waterdeep sold all manner of ropes, including thick cables.
* Nueths Fine Nets in Waterdeep sold a variety of useful implements used on ships, including thin, waxed, wire-cored climbing cable favored by thieves for 30 gp per .
* The Chandlers Guild of Ravens Bluff oversaw the citys maritime tools and equipment, including the development of new kinds of wired cable.
* Rallogar Hardware in Wheloon sold tools and supplies, including rope, cable, and wire.
* Winched heavy cables installed by dwarven artisans were used to guide and control the passage of shipping on the River Chionthar at Berdusk, as the Breaking Steps rapids nearby made normal water travel impossible.
* The earthmotes of Airspur were connected by suspension bridges that used metal cabling.
* The bridge to Sadrachs Splinter was supported by crystalline cables.
* Spells that were normally used with ropes such as bind, knot, tie, and animate rope could manipulate even very heavy cables.
* A rod of sylvan prowess could launch a line of steel cable, intended to affix to a surface and carry people and cargo.
Wire-cored cable was first developed in the Realms around the mid-14 century DR.
