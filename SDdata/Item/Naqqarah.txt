The naqqarah () was a small Zakharan drum often worn at the side.
The naqqarah was fixed with a leather thong worn over the shoulder. The body of the drum was made of fire-hardened clay with hide stretched over the head. It was played with a pair of thin sticks.
Naqqarahs were popular among messengers and criers throughout the Land of Fate.
