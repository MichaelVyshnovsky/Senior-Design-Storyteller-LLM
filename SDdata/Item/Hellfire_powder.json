        "mainbody": "Hellfire powder was a dangerous and volatile substance used to increase flames temperature.\nThis substance was a fine powder of reddish-orange hue, packed in  pouches. When added to regular fire, hellfire powder dramatically increased its temperature. Because of that, hellfire powder was used by master smiths to melt and work such tough metals as adamantine. However, with usefulness came danger. Hellfire powder was an unstable substance that could become a fireball at any moment.\nHellfire powder retained its potency and properties for centuries, even if left untouched within ruins for many generations. The substance was in use in the forges of the ancient Imaskar. And by the late 14 century DR, hellfire powder was in use in Rashemen,"
