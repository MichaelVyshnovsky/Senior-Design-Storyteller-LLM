The '''''knife of the bowyer''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[knife]], used by the best craftsmen of the ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
The ''knife of the bowyer'' was quite mundane in its appearance, apart from the enchantments that cept the decay and ravages of time away from it.

==Powers==
This magic blade was enchanted to dramatically improve the wielder's crafting and bowmaking skills.

==History==
The ''knife of the bowyer'', was displayed within the Artisan's Hall within the [[Crypt of Rothilion]]. The magic tools could be found in the Fletcher's Alcove, the second alcove to the right from the entrance to the tomb. The Crypt of Rothilion was sealed before the advent of hte [[Weeping War]] and the fall of Myth Drannor. The tomb remained undisturbed until it was unsealed in [[1369 DR]] buring the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s attempts to take over the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' within the ruined City of Song.
