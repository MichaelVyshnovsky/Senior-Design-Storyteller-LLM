'''Rods''' were scepter-like objects that could be used by spellcasters to focus their spells. They were particularly favored by [[warlock]]s. Some magical rods had unique magical powers.

==Description==
Typical rods were usually 2&ndash;3 ft (61&ndash;91 cm) long cylinders made of metal, wood, or bone.

==Powers==
The primary use of rods was to channel the spellcasting powers of [[arcane]] spellcasters such as [[artificer]]s, [[bard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s or [[wizard]]s, aiding them when casting their spells. By doing so, someone using a rod as a spellcasting focus could eschew most of the more ordinary material components required for a spell.

==History==
The [[Spellplague]] changed the nature of rods in the Realms. Infused with dark, eldritch energy rods often possessed the touch of some creature with which a warlock had formed a pact. As such, many rods were particularly potent in the hands of specific warlocks, who had forged the appropriate pacts with [[outsider]]s.

==Reputation==
Rods were popular in [[Mulhorand]]. [[Dreadmaster]]s of [[Bane]] also had a special affinity for rods, and often created them.

It was known that some spellcasters carried rods in sheaths on their hips.
