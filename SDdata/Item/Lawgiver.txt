'''''Lawgiver''''' blades were [[enchanted]] [[bastard sword]]s that were created for one and only purpose â€“ to enforce law, when its authority was questioned or challenged.

==Powers==
''Lawgiver'' possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantments, however, if wielded against creatures of chaos and discord, the weapon effectively became a powerful ''+3'' magic blade.

==History==
''Lawgivers'' were created sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] to be used against creatures of chaos and individuals of dubious morals.'' Lawgiver'' swords enforced the law, regardless of whether the concepts of law and justice were aligned. Because of this, ''Lawgivers'' were often wielded in a very polarizing fashion throughout history.

As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, a ''Lawgiver'' bastard sword could be procured in the docks of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].
