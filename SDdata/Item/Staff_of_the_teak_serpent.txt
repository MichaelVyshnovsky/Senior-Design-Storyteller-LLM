The '''''staff of the teak serpent''''' was an improved version of the ''[[staff of the serpent]]'' that could be found in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region of [[east Zakhara]].

==Description==
A ''staff of the teak serpent'' was {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} long.

==Powers==
This staff could be wielded as a potent magical weapon during combat.

If wielded by a [[priest]], the staff would change into a giant [[teak serpent]] when thrown to the ground. The teak serpent measured {{SI|35|ft|long=yes}} in length and was under the complete control of the wielder. However, the staff would be destroyed if the teak serpent was slain.
