A lute was a stringed instrument with a neck and a wooden soundboard, which was often ovoid or shaped as a teardrop. Lutes were often used by bards of the Realms.
Lutes typically had a round back, so they rested easily on the players stomach. Doubled strings could be used to emit a fuller sound, and these were easily tuned by pegs.
