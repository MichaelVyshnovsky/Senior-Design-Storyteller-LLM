A '''lute''' was a stringed instrument with a neck and a wooden soundboard, which was often ovoid or shaped as a teardrop. Lutes were often used by [[bard]]s of the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]].

==Description==
Lutes typically had a round back, so they rested easily on the player's stomach. Doubled strings could be used to emit a fuller sound, and these were easily tuned by pegs.

==Availability==
* Several types of doubled-string lutes built by craftsmen in [[Calimshan]] were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
* [[Black Dugal's Music Shoppe]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Living City: Black Dugal's Music Shoppe|24}}
* [[Halambar Lutes & Harps]] in [[Waterdeep]] was a well-known musical instrument shop that sold lutes. [[Kriios Halambar]]'s lutes produced a distinctive mellow sound recognized all along the [[Sword Coast]].
* [[The Mute Lute]] in [[Neverwinter]] made lutes that were highly prized in the Realms and even offered to custom-make lutes.

==Notable Lutes==

* ''[[Doss lute]]'': One of the seven [[Instruments of the Bards]], this superior magical lute was capable of channeling [[spell]]s when played.

==Notable Users==
===Groups===
* Lutes were popular instruments for minstrels playing in royal courts and were known to be played as far north as [[Sundabar]].
===Individuals===
* [[Drake Bluenote]], a member of the [[bard]]ic group [[Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds]], occasionally played the lute ballads and songs done by the string ensemble.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/54/The New Rogues Gallery: Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds|8-9}}
* [[Felratha]]
* [[Roland the Minstrel]]

==Trivia==
