Jesseret was a poison manufactured in Faerûn, circa the .
Jesseret was a purple-colored powder that had a strong peppery flavor that numbed the tongue. It was typically used in spicy dishes in order to disguise its presence. It was created by boiling certain ingredients and possibly required other processes which were kept secret by those that dabbled in poison-making. The well-known guidebook author, Volothamp Geddarm, reported that there were at least seven ingredients, one of which was a specific type of snail. A batch of Jesseret stayed potent for about a tenday before its effectiveness faded.
The result of ingesting Jesseret was usually death, but some people were naturally partially or wholly immune to it. Most goblinkin were at least partially immune to Jesseret and it was ineffective against minotaurs and lizardfolk. The antidote for this poison was a gray powder made from a mixture of fire ash and ground horn or bone from a particular type of creature (another well-kept secret).
This poison was known in Faerûn for centuries before 1370 DR. Jesseret was the thief who invented it, and it was named after her.
