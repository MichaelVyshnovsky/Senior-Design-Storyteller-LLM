Penfalls Pot was the enchanted helmet that belonged to a dwarven writer, scribe, and scholar Angus Hammerfall who worked under a nom de plume of Artimal Penfall sometime before 1372 DR.
Penfalls Pot slightly reduced the wearers hearing but improved their resistance to sonic magic and its effects. It also increased the wearers intelligence.
Penfalls Pot traveled the world on the head of Artimal Penfall, often helping him on his war corresponding missions. In 1372 this helmet ended up in the hands of a dwarven criminal Karragh of Daggerford, very likely acquired by some unsavory means.
*Angus Hammerfall - the original owner of Penfalls Pot.
*Karragh - a murderous caravan robber who kept the helmet in his loot chest in Daggerford.
