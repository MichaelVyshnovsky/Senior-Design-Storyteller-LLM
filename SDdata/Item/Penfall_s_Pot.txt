'''''Penfall's Pot''''' was the enchanted [[helmet]] that belonged to a [[dwarf|dwarven]] writer, scribe, and scholar [[Angus Hammerfall]] who worked under a nom de plume of Artimal Penfall sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Powers==
''Penfall's Pot'' slightly reduced the wearer's hearing but improved their resistance to sonic magic and its effects. It also increased the wearer's intelligence.

==History==
''Penfall's Pot'' traveled the world on the head of Artimal Penfall, often helping him on his war corresponding missions. In 1372 this helmet ended up in the hands of a dwarven criminal [[Karragh]] of [[Daggerford]], very likely acquired by some unsavory means.

==Notable Owners==
*Angus Hammerfall - the original owner of ''Penfall's Pot''.
*Karragh - a murderous caravan robber who kept the helmet in his loot chest in Daggerford.
