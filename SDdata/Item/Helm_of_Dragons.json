        "mainbody": "The '''''Helm of Dragons''''' was a potent [[magical item]] made in [[Myth Drannor]] that was forged to defeat [[Tyranthraxus]] the Flamed One but which bestowed powers over all [[dragon]]kind.",
        "Description": "Accounts described it as a [[gold]] circlet, despite its name. On its brow was a green-hued gem, inside which was the image of a dragon standing upon its hind legs.Obviously the depiction of the ''Helm of Dragons'' in the ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' video game's \"Adventurers Journal\" is very different from that described in the ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' adventure module.",
        "Powers": "On donning the ''Helm of Dragons'', the wearer learned of its powers.\n\nIts primary, and highly specific, power was to locate the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' in which Tyranthraxus dwelled. This functioned up to {{SI|500|mile|k|long=yes}} away. Moreover, it granted the wearer greater resistances against Tyranthraxus's [[magic]].\n\nMoreover, it also enabled the wearer to speak with all dragons in their [[Draconic language|native languages]]. Most significantly, however, the wearer of the ''Helm of Dragons'' was made immune to all attacks by all living dragons. ([[Undead]] dragons, like [[dracoliches]], did not count.)\n\nHowever, all these powers were only active when Tyranthraxus was present on [[Toril]]. Once he was killed or banished, it fell dormant and only awakened at the Flamed One's return. \n\nIn any case, as a helmet, it of course also protected the wearer's head.",
        "History": "The [[elves]] of Myth Drannor fashioned the ''Helm of Dragons'' at the height of that city's prosperity, some time before its [[Weeping War|fall]] in the {{YearlinkName|714}}.<ref> Although their intent was to create an instrument with which to combat the evil entity known as Tyranthraxus, the Possessing Spirit, it was later discovered to have an array of other powers, particularly over dragons.\n\n[[File:Dracandros.png|thumb|right|250px|''Dracandros of the Crimson facing the adventurers. The ''Helm of Dragons'' not shown.'']]\nAt some point, in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a disgraced and banished [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] named [[Dracandros|Dracandros of the Crimson]] sought out the ''Helm of Dragons''. He believed that by using the ''Helm'' to speak with many of the great dragons of the [[North]] he could trigger a new [[Flight of Dragons]] and devastate the Realms, all just to win glory among his old peers and be readmitted to their ranks. Dracandros made an ally of the dracolich [[Crimdrac]] and established himself in [[Hap]], [[Battledale]]. and finally found the ''Helm of Dragons''.\n\nThen Tyranthraxus himself contacted Dracandros, under the codename \"Lord T\", and invited him to join the [[New Alliance of the Bonds]]. Dracandros accepted, believing the New Alliance would only aid his mad scheme.\n\nHowever, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, following instructions from [[Elminster]], [[adventurer]]s bearing the ''azure bonds'' confronted Dracandros in his tower on [[Haptooth Hill]]. They defeated Dracandros and dealt with the dragons he was negotiating with, lifted the curse of the ''azure bonds'', and took the ''Helm of Dragons''. It gave them the whereabouts of Tyranthraxus so they might finish their quest, with the protection of the helm and other items.<ref group=\"note\">The fate of the ''Helm of Dragons'' is unknown, but if it survived the battle with Tyranthraxus, it is possible Elminster received it, as he was later in possession of the ''Gauntlets of Moander''.",
