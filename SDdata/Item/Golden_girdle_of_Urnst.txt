'''''Golden girdles of Urnst''''', or simply ''golden girdles'', were [[enchanted]] [[belt]]s imbued with defensive magics.

==Description==
''Golden girdles'' were weaved out of red [[silk]] and strewn with flakes of [[gold]].

==Powers==
The wearer of a ''golden girdle'' gained increased protection against slashing damage.

==History==
The first ''golden girdles'' were created ages before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by a powerful [[wizard]] who sought to protect themselves from a group of evil swordsmen.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a band of the [[Knights of Solamnia]] from the world of [[Krynn]] became trapped in a massive ''[[Planar Sphere]]'' that crash-landed in the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. One of the Knights was in possession of a ''golden girdle''.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Elan Garaq]], a bound [[rakshasa]] merchant from the [[Black Pits]] of the [[Underdark]].
*[[Kirian]], the leader of an arrogant adventuring group from [[Waterdeep]], active in the mid 14{{th}} century DR.
*[[Simmeon]], a one-time ally of [[Dorn Il-Khan]], active in the  mid 14{{th}} century DR.
