        "mainbody": "'''''Gorothir's Girdle''''' was a holy text of the [[church of Shar]] that took the unusual form of a black leather [[corset]] instead of an actual [[book]]. It was said to be one of the oldest garments in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Description": "The ''Girdle'' was a black leather [[corset]] studded with many small figures carved out of [[jet]]. There were a total of 28 figures decorating it, each of them as tall as a small man's palm and sporting empty eye sockets. Those visages were particularly life-like, and were easily recognizable from each other. They were described as follows:\n:A laughing lady &bull; a sad old bearded man &bull; a jester &bull; a knight &bull; a fat woman &bull; a hook-nosed man &bull; a cowled man &bull; a bearded man in a feather cap &bull; a girl child &bull; a weeping lady &bull; a grim scarred warrior &bull; a scowling dwarf &bull; a sneering elf &bull; a crying boy &bull; a baby &bull; an idiot man &bull; a whistling man &bull; a man with his tongue sticking out &bull; a staring man &bull; a bald man &bull; a howling man &bull; a man with many tufts of hair &bull; an alluring lady &bull; a woman with her tongue sticking out &bull; a screaming woman &bull; a smiling lady &bull; a jolly man &bull; a woman with scaly skin\n\nWhile made to be worn by an individual with a small waist, the laces holding the Girdle together allowed almost anyone to wear it&mdash;albeit sometimes in a ridiculous fashion.",
        "Powers": "This sacred item was protected by enchantments against deliberate attacks and the ravages of time, making it as resistant as [[bone]] or [[ivory]]. It also benefited from a permanent [[Lesser ironguard|ironguard]] spell.\n\nThe knowledge contained in the Girdle could be revealed by placing the correct [[gem]]s in the jet figures' empty eye sockets. When a correct gem was inserted, it would stick in place and glow slightly. When a wrong gem was used it would vanish, consumed by the divine item. Once both gems in a specific figure were matched properly the corresponding spell would appear within that face in midair, in vertical floating letters of green fire. Doing so would not consume the gems, which were safeguarded by the divine relic's protective powers and could only be removed deliberately.\n\nWhile typical [[holy book]]s could only be used by faithful of the corresponding deity, [[Shar]] allowed the Girdle to be used by [[priest]]s of any faith&mdash;even against her own clergy. On occasions, Shar proved capable of corrupting the possessor of the girdle if they were not her followers already, turning them into faithful servants. She would also take actions if she deemed the current owner of the item to be too weak, whispering to more worthy priests so they could make the girdle their own.\n\nIn some cases, the ''Girdle'' granted its owner the ability to cast spells once a day such as ''[[aberrate]]'', ''[[damning darkness]]'', ''[[fiendish clarity]]'', and ''[[slow consumption]]''. It would also sometimes damages creatures of [[good]] alignment that made contact with it.",
        "Contents": "[[File:Gorothir's girdle 2.png|thumb|right|150px|''A priestess wearing the Girdle, dealing with some pesky interloper.'']]\nAs a [[spellbook]], the ''Girdle'' contained information on 28 spells, which were represented by the many visages ornamenting it: \n:''[[animate dead]]'', ''[[armor of darkness]]'', ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[circle of privacy]]'', ''[[crawling darkness]]'', ''[[creature of darkness]]'', ''[[crushing walls]]'', ''[[dark road]]'', ''[[darkbolt]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[dissension's feast]]'', ''[[efficacious monster ward]]'', ''[[greater creature of darkness]]'', ''[[grounding]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[hovering road]]'', ''[[imbue with spell ability]]'', ''[[invisibility to undead]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[mind read]]'', ''[[mindshatter]]'', ''[[miscast magic]]'', ''[[mistaken missive]]'', ''[[modify memory]]'', ''[[monster mount]]'', ''[[obscurement]]'', ''[[telepathy]]'', and ''[[whip of Shar]]''.\n\nOn the inside of the girdle, a tale described how Gorothir felled an empire with only a lie and a secret. This text also contained the specifications of the ''[[false sending]]'' spell. Some sages believe that this text wasn't originally present on the girdle, but was an addition by a former owner.",
        "History": "The ''Girdle'' was first used ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-310}} by [[Gorothir]], the Dark Prophet of the Night, a priest of Shar. While some believed that Gorothir made the item, others thought he received it from the goddess or from one of her servants.\n\nThis belt had a bloody history, moving from one owner to the next through murder and deceit.",
        "Rumors": "* The ''Girdle'' was said to be haunted by the spirits of some of its famous owners, such as Rulgond and Klaunauthe.\n* It was said amongst the clergy of Shar that secret combinations of gem placements could let the owner summon some of the spirits haunting the belt, of even the presence of the goddess herself, to answer questions and provide advice.\n* It was rumored that a 29{{th}} spell could be learned from the girdle, by placing the correct sort of stone in ''all'' eye sockets. It was unclear which stone should be used, but probably some lesser ornamental variety. The 29{{th}} spell was supposed to be ''[[mass resurrection]]''.\n* The belt was said to have appeared in markets and shops regularly and sold at a very high price, only to disappear again not long afterwards.",
        "Notable Owners": "The known owners of the ''Girdle'' are listed below in chronological order.\n* [[Gorothir]], the first owner, rumored to be the creator of the belt (''circa'' {{Yearlink|-310}})\n* [[Jurguth Goroth]], a descendant of Gorothir (''circa'' [[446 DR]])\n* [[Klaunauthe Draeyl]], a priestess of Shar (''circa'' [[469 DR]])\n* The adventurer [[Rulgond]] (''circa'' [[554 DR]], until its death in the {{YearlinkName|576}} from the blades of fellow adventurers)\n* [[Lalondra Worul]], a priestess of Shar sent by the goddess to retrieve the belt after it went through several nameless hands (''circa'' [[617 DR]]). She lost the belt after achieving [[lich]]dom in the {{YearlinkName|697}}{{Cite web enhancement/Vanrakdoom|24}} and being deserted by Shar.\n* [[Zesstra Aleanrahel]], a female drow who recovered the Girdle from the body of a dead [[illithilich]] and converted to the worship of Shar (''circa'' [[1370 DR]])."
