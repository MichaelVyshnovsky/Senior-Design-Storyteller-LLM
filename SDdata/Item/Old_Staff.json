        "Description": "Both ends of the wooden, rune-scribed [[staff]] were shod in iron. At the top a fist-sized [[sapphire]] pulsed with enormous arcane energies.",
        "History": "In [[1385 DR]], [[Zasian Menz]] (serving [[Cyric]]) and [[Kashada]] (serving [[Shar]]) traveled to [[Dweomerheart]] and were able to steal the Old Staff. Cyric subsequently used the Old Staff to slay [[Mystra]], causing the Realms-wide catastrophe known as the [[Spellplague]].\n\nAfter the Spellplague, [[Asmodeus]] somehow got the Old Staff and handed it to [[Bryseis Kakistos]] as part of their covenant. In [[1400 DR]], after Bryseis turned against Asmodeus, she gave the Old Staff to [[Caisys]] and told him to hide it so Asmodeus didn't have the opportunity to use Azuth's powers to the fullest. Caisys hid it in a cave of the [[Dead Stone Mountains]], in the world of [[Abeir]].\n\nIn [[1487 DR]], as part of a plan to separate the gods Asmodeus and Azuth, [[Farideh]] and her allies went to the Dead Stone Mountains and [[Isltan Nyaril]], [[Chosen]] of Azuth, retrieved the Old Staff. After Isltan sacrificed his life to bring back Azuth, the God of Wizards was able to claim his staff at last."
