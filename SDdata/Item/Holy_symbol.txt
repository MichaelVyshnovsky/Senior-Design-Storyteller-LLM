'''Holy symbols''' were [[divine magic|divinely]] powered implements used by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s alike to enhance their prayers or unleash the fury of their [[god]]. The holy symbol is a representation of a god or [[pantheon]].

==Description==
Holy symbols came in a wide variety of designs, though all shared the common quality of being directly blessed by a god, godlike being, or the servants of the former two for the purpose of aiding agents of the divine. In many ways, holy symbols were to clerics and paladins what [[sword]]s were to [[fighter]]s or [[wand]]s were to some [[wizard]]s.

Typical holy symbols took the form of [[amulet]]s, emblems on [[shield]]s, or reliquaries that contained fragments of sacred material.

An assortment of holy symbols made of different materials was available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. They needed to be blessed by their corresponding church in order to be effective for channeling divine magic.

==Powers==
A [[cleric]] or [[paladin]], when casting a divine spell, could use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus by holding or visibly presenting it, thereby eschewing most ordinary material components that the spell might otherwise require. Because this is a focus, their enemies will remove the holy symbol from their possession upon imprisoning them to prevent advantages.
