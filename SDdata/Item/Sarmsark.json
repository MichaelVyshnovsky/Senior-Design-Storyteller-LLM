        "mainbody": "Sarmsark was a common type of ale found and brewed all around the Sea of Fallen Stars as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe ale was a bitter and strong-tasting drink, flavored with orange rind, leaving a marmalade-like aftertaste in the drinkers mouth. Despite its flavor, Sarmsark was low in alcohol and allowed tavern goers to consume a great amount before becoming incapacitated. This made the drink a popular libation in cheap taverns.\nThe brewing recipe was widely-known, and Sarmsark was created all around the nations of the Inner Sea, such as Sembia, Thesk, Turmish, and many others."
