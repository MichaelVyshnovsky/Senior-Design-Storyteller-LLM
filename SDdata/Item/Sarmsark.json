        "mainbody": "'''Sarmsark''' was a common type of [[ale]] found and brewed all around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The ale was a bitter and strong-tasting drink, flavored with [[orange]] rind, leaving a [[marmalade]]-like aftertaste in the drinker's mouth. Despite its flavor, Sarmsark was low in alcohol and allowed tavern goers to consume a great amount before becoming incapacitated. This made the drink a popular libation in cheap taverns.\n\nThe brewing recipe was widely-known, and Sarmsark was created all around the nations of the Inner Sea, such as [[Sembia]], [[Thesk]], [[Turmish]], and many others."
