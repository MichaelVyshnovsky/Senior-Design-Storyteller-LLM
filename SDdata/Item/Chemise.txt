'''Chemise''', or '''shift''', was a kind of garment (often feminine, but broadly gender neutral) that resembled a [[smock]], typically made of [[linen]]. A chemise could be worn as a simple overgarment (as favored by [[commoners]]) or layered under more fancy clothing like a [[cote]], [[dress]], [[robe]], or [[doublet]] to protect them from sweat and bodily [[oil]]s.

==Description==
A typical chemise was a smock that covered a woman beginning from her shoulders and to her thigh or mid-calf. Some were sleeveless, while others had short or long sleeves. Some were designed to be held together with ties. Light colors, like white or yellow, were used to dye chemises in [[Halruaa]] in the [[Shining South]].{{Cite digital book/Depths of Madness||1}} Tightly laced chemises were known to wrap bodies of women in the [[Savage Frontier]] and in [[West Faerûn]].

==Variants==
Chemises sold via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' were sturdy and pretty enough to be worn as outerwear, not just undergarments. The chemises were priced depending on the material: simple sackcloth was valued at 8 [[copper]] [[coin]]s, linen went for two [[gold]]s, imported [[Maztica]]n [[cotton]] – three gold pieces, and [[silk]] – six gold pieces. ''Aurora's'' chemises came only in white, beige, or gray colors.

[[Cormyr]]ean chemises were [[dye]]d in loud red color, but, unlike other variants, were fitted and woven of fine silk.{{Cite digital book/Cormyr: A Novel||9}} When white chemise of any sleeve length was worn, it was topped with a smock or a [[bodice]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|72}}

Commoners of [[Tethyr]] wore a significantly simpler variant. Their chemises were drab and brown, made of simple burlap.

Chemise weaved by the [[drow]] of [[Underdark]] were made of light, almost whisp-like gauzy fabric that offered little to no warmth to the wearer. Elvish chemises were made using pale gray silk and worn underneath [[gown]]s.

==History==
Female chemises were worn as far back as the days of the ancient [[Netheril]]. Some of the Netherese wearers included the [[Church of Shar]], whose priestly garb included black [[velvet]] chemise for the women. That fashion was still worn by [[Shar]]'s clergy into the late 14{{th}} century DR.
