The '''''Wand of Silvias''''' was an ancient [[magic]]al [[wand]] that had the power to repel seemingly any creature.

==Description==
The unique wand was beautifully crafted, made of a sleek gold material and held a blue orb. It was etched in runes across its top. Part of it was made from a [[beholder]]'s eyestalk, and thus was one of the few magical items that could affect beholders.

==History==
A mysterious robed figure may have told the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]-to-be that [[Xanathar]]'s drow minions wanted to steal the wand from the [[dwarves]] residing above them. They would use this to raid Waterdeep, however, this would alert the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to the immensity of the threat of Xanathar's plans. Thus, the evil beholder's conquest would be delayed.

After King [[Teirgoh]] was cured of his coma, he handed the Heroes of Waterdeep-to-be the powerful wand. They may have used it to force Xanathar into his own trap, killing him.

==Notable Owners==
* King [[Teirgoh]]
* The [[Heroes of Waterdeep]]
