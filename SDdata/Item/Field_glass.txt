A field glass was a popular export from the Shining Lands in 1367 DR. It was available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Field glasses were used to magnify the users vision over great distances. A field glass typically at least doubled the distance vision of any scout or lookout.
A field glass was made by attaching special lenses, shaped by gnome artificers in Ormpe, to either end of a cylinder.
Field glasses were coveted by captains sailing both the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Sword Coast.
They were extremely popular among sailors on the Great Sea, allowing them to spot pirates long before the pirates even knew they were there.
