When the sword was wielded in the owners dominant hand, it dealt additional piercing damage.\nOrin the Red, the murderous daughter of Sarevok Anchev, wielded the Crimson Mischief since she was a mere child, entertaining her sadistic tendencies. She still used the sword as one of her favorite blades in the  and it only left her cruel hands after her death."
