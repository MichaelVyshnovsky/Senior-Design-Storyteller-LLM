        "Powers": "''Charged battle axes'' possessed ''+2'' enchantment that made the weapon's edge more deadly and guided the wielder's hand towards the target. Additionally, the axe had a [[coin]]toss of a chance of dealing lightning damage to the target and a three out of every twenty successful slashes stunned the target.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''charged battle axes'' could be found in the ruined labyrinthine dungeons of [[Dorn's Deep]] in the [[Spine of the World]]. Another such axe belonged to [[Doogal]], a thuggish trapper from the town of [[Lonelywood]] of the [[Ten Towns]]."
