{{wikipedia article|Variscite}}
'''Variscite''', also known as '''lucinite''' and '''peganite''', was an [[Ornamental stones|ornamental stone]] found in nodules or in rock seams.

==Description==
This stone was translucent and came in deep to pale shades of yellowish green. When cut [[wikipedia:cabochon|cabochon]] and polished they occasionally displayed gray and yellow bands or rings ("eyes").

==Powers==
Variscite was poisonous to [[lycanthrope]]s and, if delivered into the bloodstream on the tip of a weapon, caused triple the normal damage for that strike. Once a lycanthrope was infected with variscite, further exposure did no additional harm until the subject recovered&mdash;a process that took a full 24 hours. Infection could also be accomplished if a variscite stone, say mounted in a ring or other jewelry, were pressed into an open wound on a lycanthrope, or touched to the creature's tongue.
