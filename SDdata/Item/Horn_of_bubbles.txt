A '''''horn of bubbles''''' was a type of [[curse]]d [[horn]] that produced an array of soapy suds to inconvenience those who blew them.

==Description==
These horns were known vary widely in appearance. Some resembled mere mundane horns, while others bore a resemblance to known types of magical horns.

==Powers==
In the hands of most individuals, a ''horn of bubbles'' would produce no sound upon being blown. The cursed effect of the horn was delayed, triggering the next time someone was actively trying to kill the individual who had blown the horn. When this occurred, the horn would sound a note and manifest an array of soapy suds, similar to the [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] of a [[pink dragon]],<ref>{{Cite dragon/156/Not Necessarily the Monstrous Compendium|18}} that completely surrounded and blinded the horn blower for anywhere from 2 to 20 minutes.

In the hands of a proper [[bard]], a ''horn of bubbles'' would instead sound upon being played and expel a mass of bubbles, covering a {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} conical area. Those caught in this barrage of soapy sups would similarly find themselves blinded for a period of 2 to 20 minutes. However, a ''horn of bubbles'' was not without danger for the bard, as it had a 5% chance of backfiring, or a 1% chance in the case of a [[jester]]. When this occurred a ''horn of bubbles'' would suck the blower through it and [[polymorph]] them into the bubbles it expelled. If the bard was not polymorphed back before all bubbles popped, they would be irrevocably dead.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Perizade]], a [[dragon turtle]] that lived in a small network of underwater caves below the island of [[Sahu]], had a ''horn of bubbles'' as part of her treasure horde in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a small pack of [[leucrotta]] were lairing within the [[Arcane Chambers]] level of [[Undermountain]]. Within the room they settled down in, the leucrotta amassed a sizeable horde of treasure, which included a [[gold]]-plated [[steel]] ''horn of bubbles''.
