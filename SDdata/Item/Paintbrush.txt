A paintbrush was a basic tool used by artists, scribes, and limners.
A paintbrush was usually made of a wooden or ceramic handle with an attached hair head that picked up and applied paint or ink.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a wide selection of brushes for scribes and artists made with camel hair from Calimshan. Small and medium scribes brushes were had for 3 sp and 4 sp, as well as 4-inch brushes for painting buildings (4 gp), 1-inch brushes for sighwriting (5 gp), and 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16-inch and hairline brushes for fine painting and portraiture.
