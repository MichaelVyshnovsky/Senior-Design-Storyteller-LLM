A potion of fire breath, also known as an elixir of fire breath, was a potion that gave its drinker the temporary power to breathe fire a limited number of times.
Typical potions of fire breath were glimmering orange in color and covered in smoke that filled the top of any closed containers they were kept in. Once opened, the smoke drifted away.
Upon drinking a potion of fire breath, a creature gained the ability to breathe fire out to a range of  up to three times. This effect lasted for 1 hour, or until all breaths were expended. The fire was powerful enough to deal substantial damage to anyone within range not able to escape it in time. Pre-Spellplague versions of the potion had a range of  and could only be aimed at a single target.
Ash from something burned by a dragons fire could be used in crafting one of these potions.
