        "mainbody": "The Stone Mouth was a strange magical trinket that could act as an interpreter between gargoyles and creatures who did not speak their language, found in the ruins of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR.\nThe Stone Mouth was a hefty stone pedant. It was carved to closely resemble a grotesque mouth of a gargoyle.\nWhen worn, the Stone Mouth became animated, as if part of a living creature. The amulet repeated the wearers words in the language of gargoyles and margoyles (terran) when spoken in common (or any other language the user was familiar with), and when the amulet heard a response in terran, it did repeated them back in the users native tongue.\nNot much was known of this strange item. It was created at some point long before 1369 DR and left in an ancient dvarven tomb under Glim-Gardens in Myth Drannor. Centuries later, the item was recovered by the Veiled Ones. Taken from the undead hands of two shadows, a mysterious red-hued spectre who seemed to be waiting for the adventurers arrival, and two hungry ghasts. The Veiled Ones used the Stone Mouth to communicate with friendly gargoyles in the ruins of the city."
