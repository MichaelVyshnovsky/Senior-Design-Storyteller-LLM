        "mainbody": "The '''''Stone Mouth''''' was a strange magical trinket that could act as an interpreter between [[gargoyle]]s and creatures who did not speak their language, found in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "The ''Stone Mouth'' was a hefty stone pedant. It was carved to closely resemble a grotesque mouth of a gargoyle.",
        "Powers": "When worn, the ''Stone Mouth'' became animated, as if part of a living creature. The amulet repeated the wearers' words in the language of gargoyles and [[margoyle]]s ([[terran]]) when spoken in [[common]] (or any other language the user was familiar with), and when the amulet heard a response in terran, it did repeated them back in the user's native tongue.",
        "History": "Not much was known of this strange item. It was created at some point long before [[1369 DR]] and left in an ancient [[dwarf|dvarven]] tomb under [[Glim-Gardens]] in Myth Drannor. Centuries later, the item was recovered by the [[Veiled Ones]]. Taken from the [[undead]] hands of two [[shadow]]s, a mysterious red-hued [[spectre]] who seemed to be waiting for the adventurers arrival, and two hungry [[ghast]]s. The Veiled Ones used the ''Stone Mouth'' to communicate with friendly gargoyles in the ruins of the city."
