        "mainbody": "The '''Imaskarran Tome of Ice''' was a heavy and tattered tome with a single rune on the cover, translating simply to \"Ice\". The Imaskarran Tome of Ice detailed the process of creating an [[amulet of natural armor]] from a [[quartz]] crystal and the knuckle of a [[skeleton]], using the spell ''[[mage armor]]''.\n\n[[Eltoora Sarptyl]] sought, maybe with the help of the [[Hero of Neverwinter]], this tome around [[Port Llast]]. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]. It was in the possession of the wizard Wanev, close to Port Llast.{{cite game/Neverwinter Nights}}"
