The Imaskarran Tome of Ice detailed the process of creating an amulet of natural armor from a quartz crystal and the knuckle of a skeleton, using the spell mage armor.\nEltoora Sarptyl sought, maybe with the help of the Hero of Neverwinter, this tome around Port Llast. Though allegedly of Imaskarran origin, they were readable to the Hero of Neverwinter. It was in the possession of the wizard Wanev, close to Port Llast."
