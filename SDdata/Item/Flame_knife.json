        "mainbody": "Flame knives were special weapons used by holy slayer assassins in Zakhara.\nThese knives had a wavy blade.\nMembers of the Flamedeath Fellowship used these wicked blades smeared with pitch or even oil of liquid stars. The oil was set aflame and wielded in combat. Members of the Flamedeath Fellowship preferred using this tactic at night to intimidate their opponents. The dagger was often left behind as a warning sign to keep others from straying from the path the fellowship endorsed.\nFlame knives cost 2 gold pieces."
