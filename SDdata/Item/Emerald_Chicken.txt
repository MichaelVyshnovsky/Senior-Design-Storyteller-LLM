'''Emerald Chicken''' was one of several specialty dishes served at the ramshackle [[Owlroost Head Inn]] of the [[Amn]]ian town of [[Purskul]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Emerald Chicken was a dish seasoned with the hottest [[spice]]s. It was a collection of cooked and chopped greens, [[onion]]s, [[chicken liver]]s, and other sporadic bits of a local breed of [[chicken]] that was the dish's namesake. The chopped and spiced dish was served on a bed of [[rice]].

==History==
As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, Emerald Chicken was just as popular of a dish as the inn's house [[pork dumpling]]s.
