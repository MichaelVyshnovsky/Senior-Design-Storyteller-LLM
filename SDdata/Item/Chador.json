        "Description": "These robes covered a woman's entire body and came with hoods and special face-coverings that allowed the wearer to see clearly while still shielding her eyes from view. This garment was common in regions where moralists had power. Chadors were available in white for unmarried women, black for married women, and red for widows.\n\nUnderneath a chador, a woman would wear [[trousers]], a [[blouse]], and a [[tunic]], and sometimes a vest, or they would wear a [[caftan]].",
        "Prices": "A typical chador sold for 8 [[silver piece]]s.{{cite book/Arabian Adventures|86}}"
