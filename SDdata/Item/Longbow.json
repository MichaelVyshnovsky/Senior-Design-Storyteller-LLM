        "mainbody": "A longbow is a two-handed, martial ranged weapon of the bow family.\nThe longbow is a flexible shaft of wood (or horn or bone) about  long with the ends connected by a bowstring that was a little shorter than the shaft, causing the wood to bend and keep the string under tension. For a composite longbow, the shaft is made from laminated materials (again, horn, wood or bone) and fashioned with a recurve, meaning the bow remains bow-shaped even when unstrung.\nIt was commonly known that it took about five years of training to become proficient at the use of the longbow.\nThe length of a longbow can vary up to about the height of the archer but it quickly becomes unwieldy, getting caught on things or tripping the user. Composite bows are stronger than normal bows and therefore can translate more of the archers strength into range and damage. Bows require two hands to fire and a good amount of practice in order to hit a target. Therefore, the longbow is considered a martial weapon. You may not use a longbow while mounted, however you may use a composite longbow from the back of a mount.\nThe longbow seems to have been invented by the elves.\n Aquatic longbow  A weapon favored by the aquatic elves with a kelp string.\n* Catti-brie owned a magic longbow by the name of Taulmaril.\n* Saarvin used longbows, including one he fashioned himself from the jaw of a white dragon and another known as the Outlander.\n* The Oerthian nature goddess Ehlonna was known to favor longbows."
