The '''''medallion of proof''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[amulet]] and changed its appearance depending on which deity the wearer drew powers from, worshipped, or was aligned with.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|26}}

==Powers==
The ''medallion of proof'' radiated a strong aura of [[alteration]] magic. Its transformation was not a conscious decision of the wearer but was guided by their true feelings and alignment. In a case when the wearer venerated several deities, the ''medallion of proof'' changed to reflect the god that the wearer was most aligned with. On rare occasions when the wearer had no power they worshiped – the amulet turned into a blank disk. The ''medallion of proof's'' magic could not be blocked by [[spell]]s nor other enchanted items, and the ''medallion'' could not be used as a ''[[holy symbol]]'' by [[paladin]]s nor [[cleric]]s.

When the amulet represented [[Chauntea]], it depicted a flower bulb on the background of a shining sun with the amulet being encircled by small vines.

==History==
After the war against the [[Tuigan Horde]] ended in [[the Vast]], a young [[priest]] of Chauntea took over the [[Morden Winery]] located in a valley outside the village of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]]. But soon after, the priest – [[Larn]], was [[petrified]] by the [[maedar]] winemaker [[Vorlon]] and his consort – [[medusa]] [[Samanthiss]]. For the decade that followed, Larn was left a statue with the ''medallion of proof'', adorned with Chauntea's ''holy symbol'' hanging on his neck. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the ''medallion of proof'' could've been given to a group of heroes from [[Ravens Bluff]] as a reward for killing the medusa or peacefully negotiating the vinery and Larn's freedom.{{Cite organized play/LC/Before Its Time|23}}
