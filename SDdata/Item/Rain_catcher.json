        "mainbody": "A '''rain catcher''' was a simple contraption used to collect rainwater in the wilderness. They were considered an important tool for [[adventurer]]s journeying into regions where sources of freshwater were unsafe to drink, such as in the jungles of [[Chult]].",
        "Description": "The purpose of a rain catcher was to serve as a lightweight and mobile basin for catching rainwater. It comprised a {{SIAdj|5|sq. ft|long=yes}} tarp made of [[leather]] that was stretched across a wooden frame that could easily be folded for transport. When erected, it could collect rain water at a rate of about {{SI|2|gallons|l|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}} of rain, and it could hold up to {{SI|8|gallons|l|long=yes}}.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], explorers in Chult were advised to use rain catchers or to boil any river water in the jungles The sale of rain catchers was strictly regulated in [[Port Nyanzaru]]&mdash;the only city in Chult at the time&mdash;with all sales being controlled by the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Ekene-Afa]]. They could be bought at the city's [[Red Bazaar]] for one [[gold piece]]."
