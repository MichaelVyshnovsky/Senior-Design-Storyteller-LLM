        "mainbody": "Raegens sword was a rare magical longsword blessed by Helm himself that belonged to an adventurer and mercenary Raegen Brunegar circa 1372 DR.\nBlessed by the God of Guardians, Raegens sword was imbued with holy enchantments that were deadly to undead. Apart from additional divine damage done to the undead, this sword possessed a +1 enchantment, had a keen edge that made critical strikes especially divesting, and glowed with dim yellow light in  radius.\nRaegen Brunegar wielded her sword famously using it while adventuring with the hero of Daggerford in 1372 DR, aiding in stopping Zhentarims plans of taking over the city, stopping a powerful fiend Gorgomorz from laying waste to the city, and rescuing the Duke and Duchess of Daggerford."
