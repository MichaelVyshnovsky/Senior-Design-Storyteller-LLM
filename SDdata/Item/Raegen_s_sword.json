Apart from additional divine damage done to the undead, this sword possessed a ''+1'' enchantment, had a keen edge that made critical strikes especially divesting, and glowed with dim yellow light in {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} radius.",
        "History": "Raegen Brunegar wielded her sword famously using it while adventuring with the hero of [[Daggerford]] in [[1372 DR]], aiding in stopping [[Zhentarim]]'s plans of taking over the city, stopping a powerful [[fiend]] [[Gorgomorz]] from laying waste to the city, and rescuing the [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke]] and [[Bronwyn Daggerford|Duchess]] of Daggerford."
