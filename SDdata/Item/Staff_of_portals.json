        "mainbody": "A '''''staff of portals''''' was a [[magic]]al [[staff]] that had a plethora of powers over ''[[portal]]s''.",
        "Description": "A ''staff of portals'' was built from different wooden and metallic materials. The general staff was built using [[darkwood]], purple [[heartswood]], [[mahogany]], and [[ash]]. The varied woods were bound together by means of ferrules, again made of different materials like [[iron]], [[mithral]], [[steel]], and [[adamantine]].",
        "Powers": "A ''staff of portals'' was a charge-based [[magic item]]. If a person was willing to deplete only the minimum amount of stored power, the ''staff of portals'' could be used to cast ''[[analyze portal]]'' or ''[[portal view]]''. On using double the amount of energy, it provided ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[portal barricade]]'', and ''[[portal-to-portal redirect]]''. A person willing to deplete the staff even more could cast either ''[[etherealness]]'' or ''[[portal reformat]]'' from it.",
        "Creation": "A ''staff of portals'' could only be created by someone who was capable of casting a large array of spells, namely ''analyze portal'', ''dimension door'', ''etherealness'', ''portal barricade'', ''portal-to-portal redirect'', and ''portal view''.",
        "History": "The ''staff of portals'' was invented some time before [[1372 DR]] in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Reputation": "A ''staff of portals'' was a magical staff that could be only be used by divine spellcasters with access to the [[Portal domain]] to its full potential. Other casters could make use of the staff, just not all of its properties."
