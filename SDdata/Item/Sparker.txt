Sparkers were simple, non-magical items in the Realms often used by wizards during scientific experiments to induce a fiery spark into a beaker of vapor.
A sparker was a small hand-held device consisting of flint and steel set on a wire loop hinge.
These items were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue for 5 silver pieces.
* Sparkers were favored by wizards.
