        "Description": "The uhkerek, a transportation sled akin to the [[jakerek]], boasted a larger size and employed two [[caribou]] as pulling animals. Its platform took on a box-like shape, with sides standing at approximately {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} in height. The bottom of the platform was lined with [[seal]] skins, generously coated in blubber to minimize friction. Typically utilized for transporting supplies, the uhkerek also accommodated up to three passengers when necessary."
