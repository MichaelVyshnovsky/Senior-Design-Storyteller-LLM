The '''Blazing Banner of Ologh the Overking''' was the famous battle standard of [[Ologh]], the [[Overking]] of the [[orc]]ish kingdom of [[Vastar]] in the 6{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|66}}

==History==
Ologh carried the Blazing Banner into battle, before being slain by the [[black dragon]] [[Iyrauroth]] in the [[572 DR|Year of Writhing Darkness, 572 DR]].

At some point, the [[sapphire dragon]] [[Bleucorundum]], a collector of important military artifacts, obtained the Blazing Banner of Ologh the Overking. He kept it in his lair in the [[Halls of the Sleeping Legion]] in the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] of [[Tethyr]] by [[1370 DR]].

==Powers==
The Blazing Banner had the powers of a ''[[law's banner]]'', boosting the morale of lawful armies. When raised in battle, it also turned into a tapestry of fire.
