        "mainbody": "Warning is a quality that can be applied to magical weapons, making it so the wielder is not at a disadvantage if taken by surprise in battle. \nWielders of a weapon of warning could not be surprised and were able to act with greater initiative in battle. Such a weapon could further awaken its owner and their companions if fighting started nearby.\n*Auspex was a longsword of warning kept at the House of Thalivar by the Neverwinter garrison occupying Leilon in the late 15 century DR."
