Gorothirs Girdle was a holy text of the church of Shar that took the unusual form of a black leather corset instead of an actual book. It was said to be one of the oldest garments in Faer√ªn.
The Girdle was a black leather corset studded with many small figures carved out of jet. There were a total of 28 figures decorating it, each of them as tall as a small mans palm and sporting empty eye sockets. Those visages were particularly life-like, and were easily recognizable from each other. They were described as follows
A laughing lady &bull a sad old bearded man &bull a jester &bull a knight &bull a fat woman &bull a hook-nosed man &bull a cowled man &bull a bearded man in a feather cap &bull a girl child &bull a weeping lady &bull a grim scarred warrior &bull a scowling dwarf &bull a sneering elf &bull a crying boy &bull a baby &bull an idiot man &bull a whistling man &bull a man with his tongue sticking out &bull a staring man &bull a bald man &bull a howling man &bull a man with many tufts of hair &bull an alluring lady &bull a woman with her tongue sticking out &bull a screaming woman &bull a smiling lady &bull a jolly man &bull a woman with scaly skin
While made to be worn by an individual with a small waist, the laces holding the Girdle together allowed almost anyone to wear it&mdashalbeit sometimes in a ridiculous fashion.
This sacred item was protected by enchantments against deliberate attacks and the ravages of time, making it as resistant as bone or ivory. It also benefited from a permanent ironguard spell.
The knowledge contained in the Girdle could be revealed by placing the correct gems in the jet figures empty eye sockets. When a correct gem was inserted, it would stick in place and glow slightly. When a wrong gem was used it would vanish, consumed by the divine item. Once both gems in a specific figure were matched properly the corresponding spell would appear within that face in midair, in vertical floating letters of green fire. Doing so would not consume the gems, which were safeguarded by the divine relics protective powers and could only be removed deliberately.
While typical holy books could only be used by faithful of the corresponding deity, Shar allowed the Girdle to be used by priests of any faith&mdasheven against her own clergy. On occasions, Shar proved capable of corrupting the possessor of the girdle if they were not her followers already, turning them into faithful servants. She would also take actions if she deemed the current owner of the item to be too weak, whispering to more worthy priests so they could make the girdle their own.
In some cases, the Girdle granted its owner the ability to cast spells once a day such as aberrate, damning darkness, fiendish clarity, and slow consumption. It would also sometimes damages creatures of good alignment that made contact with it.

On the inside of the girdle, a tale described how Gorothir felled an empire with only a lie and a secret. This text also contained the specifications of the false sending spell. Some sages believe that this text wasnt originally present on the girdle, but was an addition by a former owner.
The Girdle was first used circa  by Gorothir, the Dark Prophet of the Night, a priest of Shar. While some believed that Gorothir made the item, others thought he received it from the goddess or from one of her servants.
This belt had a bloody history, moving from one owner to the next through murder and deceit.
* The Girdle was said to be haunted by the spirits of some of its famous owners, such as Rulgond and Klaunauthe.
* It was said amongst the clergy of Shar that secret combinations of gem placements could let the owner summon some of the spirits haunting the belt, of even the presence of the goddess herself, to answer questions and provide advice.
* It was rumored that a 29 spell could be learned from the girdle, by placing the correct sort of stone in all eye sockets. It was unclear which stone should be used, but probably some lesser ornamental variety. The 29 spell was supposed to be mass resurrection.
