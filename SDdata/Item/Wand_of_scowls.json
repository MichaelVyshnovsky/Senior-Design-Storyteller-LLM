        "mainbody": "wand of scowls was a common magical wand that forced a creature to scowl.\nWith this wand, a caster was able to target any creature within 30 feet (9 meters). It forced the target creature to scowl for one minute. The wand had three charges, which were recharged daily at dawn. There was a chance that, after using up the last charge, the wand could spontaneously become a wand of smiles"
