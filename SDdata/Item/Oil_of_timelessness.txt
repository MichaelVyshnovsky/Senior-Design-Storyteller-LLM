'''''Oil of timelessness''''', or '''''unguent of timelessness''''',{{Cite web enhancement/Ghostwalk Update for D&D V.3.5}}While oil and unguent are definitely not the same, the two magic items appear to have been used interchangeably. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that they are the same item: see Ghostwalk conversion booklet. was a concoction employed to guard against deterioration and spoiling.

==Description==
The smooth oil itself was of dubious appearance, possibly even calling to mind poisonousness.

==Powers==
When labeled as oil, the substance was usually bottled in fractions enough to coat a [[horse]] or eight men. After {{yearlink|1372}}, when it was more often labeled ''unguent'', most containers held enough to coat eight men, four horses, or two [[elephant]]s. If used on any substance that was only alive, the oil slowed down decay to the point that every year affected it as if only a day had passed. It also rendered the item somewhat more resistant to all forms of damage until removed.

It coated twice as much in the [[Demiplane of Time]].{{cite book/Chronomancer|73}}

==Preparation==
''Oil of timelessness'' had several recipes over the years; it required the essence of [[elemental]]s from the [[Demiplane of Time]] in recipes from {{yearlink|1357}},{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|35}} powdered amber in recipes from {{yearlink|1367}},{{cite book/Book of Artifacts|122}} and just experience in construction of magic items by {{yearlink|1372}}.

==Notable Oils==
* [[Tessele Whitehorn]] carried some ''oil of timelessness'' on her person.{{cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|5}}
* A chamber in [[Undermountain]] held some oil.{{cite book/The Ruins of Undermountain/Campaign Guide to Undermountain|101}}
* ''Oil of timelessness'' was a common [[Mulan]]i magic item.{{cite book/Races of Faer√ªn|97}}

==Trivia==
