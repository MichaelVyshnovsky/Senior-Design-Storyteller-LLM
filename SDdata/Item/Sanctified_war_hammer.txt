Sanctified war hammers were enchanted warhammers often wielded by clerics and paladins.
These weapons appeared fairly mundane. The bone-crushing hammer heads were cast entirely out of steel and affixed atop a  shaft.
Imbued with beneficial magics, sanctified war hammers possessed a +3 enchantment and if wielded by a priest, expanded their minds, allowing them to memorize three additional divine magic spells.
By 1281 DR, several of these sanctified bludgeons could be found around the Spine of the World, and within the ruined citadel of Seldarines Hand.
