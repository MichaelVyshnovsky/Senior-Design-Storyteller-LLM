Wands of negative energy were offensive magic wands imbued with arcane negative energy.
These wands were crafted out of elven femurs. The bone shafts were smoothed and yellowed by many hands that held these wands since their creation. The gruesomeness of these magic items was accentuated by fetishes that dangled off these wands. The negative energy at the core of these wands made anyone touching them feel the unpleasant sensation of their flesh crawling.
Usable by bards, sorcerers, and wizards, fully-charged wands of negative energy held fifty uses of the negative energy ray.
In the late 14 century DR, these evil-looking wands could be found throughout the Sword Coast region, notably in the cities of Neverwinter and Daggerford.
