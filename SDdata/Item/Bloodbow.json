        "mainbody": "The '''''Bloodbow''''' was an enchanted [[longbow]] that belonged to an ancient [[elf|elven]] hero [[Arianna|Arianna the Archer]].",
        "Description": "The ''Bloodbow'' was a relatively simple-looking longbow of elven crafting, its most notable feature was its blood-red color.",
        "Powers": "The ''Bloodbow'' had a ''+4'' enchantment as well as it gave its owner the ability to cast the ''[[slay living]]'' spell. In [[1369 DR]] the bow only had three charges of theft spell left.",
        "History": "The ''Bloodbow'' was laid to rest long before the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Weeping War]], in the [[Elven Catacombs]] deep underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]]. Arianna the Archer was one of the ancient elven heroes interred within one of the crypts within the catacombs. In [[1369 DR]], the ''Bloodbow'' was still within its mistress' sarcophagus. Arianna's spirit, along with several other heroes' in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the ''Bloodbow'' were to be removed from the sarcophagus, Arianna's [[wraith]] was there to punish the grave-robbers."
