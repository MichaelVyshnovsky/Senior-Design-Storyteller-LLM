        "mainbody": "The Bloodbow was an enchanted longbow that belonged to an ancient elven hero Arianna the Archer.\nThe Bloodbow was a relatively simple-looking longbow of elven crafting, its most notable feature was its blood-red color.\nThe Bloodbow had a +4 enchantment as well as it gave its owner the ability to cast the slay living spell. In 1369 DR the bow only had three charges of theft spell left.\nThe Bloodbow was laid to rest long before the fall of Myth Drannor during the Weeping War, in the Elven Catacombs deep underneath Castle Cormanthor. Arianna the Archer was one of the ancient elven heroes interred within one of the crypts within the catacombs. In 1369 DR, the Bloodbow was still within its mistress sarcophagus. Ariannas spirit, along with several other heroes in the same crypt, was still trapped inside the ruined city and corrupted by the magics of the Weeping War. If the Bloodbow were to be removed from the sarcophagus, Ariannas wraith was there to punish the grave-robbers."
