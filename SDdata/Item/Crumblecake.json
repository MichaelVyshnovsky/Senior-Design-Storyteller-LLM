        "mainbody": "'''Crumblecake''' was a moist loaf from the town of [[Red Larch]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], in [[northwest Faer√ªn]], made from nuts, chickpea mash, chopped roots and greens, turkey, and wildfowl scraps, and then baked together.\n\nWhen ordering a crumblecake in an inn, they were often served with strong sauces, and usually with fried onions.",
        "Reception": "It was said to have health benefits, but it was not regarded as a \"tasty\" dish.",
        "History": "Around [[1360 DR]], a crumblecake was sold for between one and three copper pieces depending on the size and quality.\n\nAs of [[1489 DR]], it was known to be served at the [[Swinging Sword]] and the [[Blackbutter Inn]] in Red Larch, and ingredients were often sourced from a nearby walled abbey with farms, named [[Goldenfields]].",
        "Prices": "* A loaf for 1 to 3 [[cp]]"
