{{Quote
|Many desert travelers carry these, true?
|[[Jamilia]]
}}

==Description==
{{Quote
|Perhaps it is a mistake for desert travelers to carry small waterskins. Wouldn't it be wiser for them to emulate the [[turtle]], and carry containers the size of their backs?
|[[Jamilia]]
}}
Waterskins were often shaped like kidneys and made of [[goat]]skin, but they could also come in a variety of other styles. [[Faer√ªn]],

==Powers==
[[Magic]] waterskins existed throughout the [[Realms]], particularly in Maztica.

==Notable Waterskins==
* A notable magical waterskin was the Maztican ''[[waterskin of pouring]]''. This magic feathered waterskin was always full and could pour out a gallon of water every minute.

* The ''[[decanter of salt water]]'', which could be found in [[Undermountain]], could turn any liquid poured into it into salt water.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]] carried a waterskin that had a nozzle attached to it; he loved to fill it with [[holy water]] and squirt [[undead]].
