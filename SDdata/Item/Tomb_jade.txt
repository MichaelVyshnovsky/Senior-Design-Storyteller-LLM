'''Tomb Jade''' was the name for [[jade]] that had been buried for centuries and turned from green to red or brown.

==Description==
Tomb jade was rare and commanded a high price in the Realms. A typical specimen had a base value of 1,000 gp. Note that jade turned green if buried with items made of bronze which rendered it equivalent in value to normal jade.

==Powers==
Powdered tomb jade was an ingredient in ''[[potion of undead control|potions of undead control]]''. It could also be used as a talisman for turning [[undead]], granting a priest a second chance to turn an undead creature after a failed attempt.
