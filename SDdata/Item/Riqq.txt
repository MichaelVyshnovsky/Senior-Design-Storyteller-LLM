A riqq () was a Zakharan instrument similar to the tambourine.
Riqqs were essentially tiny drums fixed with chimes or bells into slots around the sides.
Riqqs were often used by dancers to keep tempo during a performance. A smaller version of riqqs, called daffs, were used by the natives of the Furrowed Mountains.
