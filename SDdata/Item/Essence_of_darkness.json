        "mainbody": "'''''Essence of darkness''''' was a type of [[magic]] [[oil]] was a concentrated, liquefied darkness that had multiple applications for [[thieves]].",
        "Description": "These oils were typically kept in light-proof containers, often bottles or [[vial]]s, but sometimes small [[ceramic]] or [[glass]] spheres that were referred to as ''darkness bombs''. On average, a container of this substance held around five to eight doses.",
        "Powers": "''Essence of darkness'' was a volatile substance. It would dissipate upon one hour of exposure to [[sunlight]] and would explode if its container was violently struck. A full container of ''essence of darkness'' usually issued in a magical effect akin to the [[spell]] ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'', whilst a single dose of the substance would only cover a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} area with magical ''[[darkness]]''. Some thieves took advantage of this property, crafting the aforementioned ''darkness bombs'' and throwing them against hard surfaces.\n\nIf imbibed, ''essence of darkness'' would cause every aspect of a creature's body to become matte black for a period of 40 to 80 minutes.''[[The Complete Thief's Handbook]]'' states that the duration when imbibed is \"the same duration as a standard potion\". Within the 2{{nd}} edition [[Dungeon Master's Guide 2nd edition|Dungeon Master's Guide]], this duration is stated to be \"four complete turns plus 1d4 additional turns\". On occasion, an imbiber might issue forth a {{SI|5|ft}} radius area of ''darkness'' if violently struck.\n\nIf diluted in {{SI|1|gal|l|long=yes}} or so of water, ''essence of darkness'' could be used to make a black [[dye]] that would impart slight concealment or enhanced stealthiness effect upon any [[armor]], clothing, or weapon that was treated in it, allowing their wielders better chances at hiding within the shadows. {{SI|1|gal|l}} was usually sufficient enough to coat all of the equipment of a single individual. This effect would persist for six hours and ten to six minutes. On occasion, dyed equipment might issue forth a {{SI|5|ft}} radius area of ''darkness'' if violently struck.",
        "Availability": "* [[Laric Cigam]], a traveling merchant in [[the Vast]], sold ''essence of darkness'' alongside many other [[potion]]s.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Vengeance|5,28}}\n* The [[Tower of the Masked Mage]] in [[Sshamath]], whose residents were known to fashion magical items related to concealment, sometimes created ''essences of darkness''.<ref>\n* [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|11}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stakeout|11}}",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[Black Crows]], a short-lived criminal gang in Ravens Bluff in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], utilized ''essence of darkness''."
