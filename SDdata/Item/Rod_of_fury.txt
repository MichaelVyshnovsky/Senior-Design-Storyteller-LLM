A rod of fury was a magical rod that protected a spellcaster and could be used to enhance their spells.
They were originally a creation of the wizards of Mulhorand.
The end of the rod was usually carved into the shape of a Mulhorandi deity.
The rods gave varying levels of protection to the bearer. Once per day, a spellcaster bearing the rod could freely increase the power of a spell.
Creation of a rod of fury required a protection from evil/good/chaos/law spell and the ability to increase the potency and effectiveness of a spell.
Depending on the quality of the rod, it could be worth between 26,800 gold pieces and 95,600 gold pieces.
