A '''''druid's cudgel''''' was a [[magic]]al [[club]] unique to the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Powers==
These cudgels were the equivalent of a ''+1 club'' and could be further enchanted with a ''[[shillelagh]]'' [[spell]] (despite the normal restriction that the [[weapon]] used in the spell had to be nonmagical).

==Creation==
The ''druid's cudgel'' could be crafted by a [[druid]] using the branch of an [[oak]] [[tree]] that was newly dead. The tree could only have been killed through natural forces (such as lightning, disease, drought, or flooding) and the dead wood must have retained its original strength. A tree that was killed by mortal hands could not be used for this purpose. On the day before the [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]] was full, the cudgel had to be shaved of bark and carved until completely smooth. It was then kept submerged in a [[Moonwell]] from sunset to sunrise throughout the full moon night.
