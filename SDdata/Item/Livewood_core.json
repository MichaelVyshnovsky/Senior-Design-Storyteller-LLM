        "mainbody": "he livewood core was a magical device similar to an Eberronnian warforged docent, recovered from Thorn Hollow in the Kings Forest in the mid-1480s DR.\nThe livewood core provided wide-ranging protection and fortification against most threats. It caused vines, bark, and moss to grow over the warforged body and add a layer of magical defenses.\nThe core was found in the Thorn Hollow caverns of Thorngap, at a time that the druid Halsaime had taken over and corrupted nature into being his tool."
