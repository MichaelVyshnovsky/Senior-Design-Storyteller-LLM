        "mainbody": "Golden mirrors were magic items that adorned each major stronghold of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nThese mirrors were the same size as a large circular shield. The glass was encircled in a golden frame.\nEach golden mirror was linked with all of the others of its kind, allowing for instant communication between strongholds. Communication was achieved similar to a crystal ball with clairaudience properties.\nNar-Aidiya, the Bonfire, owned a special golden mirror that allowed him to appear wreathed in flames to anyone using a regular golden mirror. The Bonfires mirror also functioned the same as a mirror of mental prowess, allowing him to further dominate others."
