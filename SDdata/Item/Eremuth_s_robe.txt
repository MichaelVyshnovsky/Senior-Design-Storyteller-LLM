Eremuths robe was the enchanted robe that belonged to Eremuth Silverwind, the bastard of the Hawkwinter  noble family of Waterdeep, and later, the malaugrym agent of the Unseen who assumed Silverwinds identity.
Eremuths robe was masterfully crafted clothing of the finest quality.
This robe possessed a minor enchantment that enhanced the wearers ability to dodge out of the harms way as well as granted them small resistance to fire, mundane and magical.
Eremuths robe was created to be at the hight of Waterdhavian fashion circa 1323 DR. Strangely outdated design, however, did not bother Eremuth Silverwind when he, secretly a malaugrym, joined the Hero of Daggerfords adventuring party. The hero wondered how Eremuth hasnt been killed for audacity to wear this outfit in the Moonsea region.
