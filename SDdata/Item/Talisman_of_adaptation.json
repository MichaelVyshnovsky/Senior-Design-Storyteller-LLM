        "mainbody": "A talisman of adaptation was a magical jewel that altered the physiology of an aquatic creature, allowing the wearer to breathe air and survive outside water for one week.\nIt took the form of a multicolored coral pendant.\nThis talisman allowed a water-dweller to breathe air and to suffer no penalty for being outside water. Its effect lasted for one week, after which the talisman lost all its power, becoming a mundane decorative object. \nCrafting one required a water breathing spell."
