        "mainbody": "The Black Dragon Mask was one of the five dragon masks that carried the blessings of Tiamat in the efforts of the reformed Cult of the Dragon to summon her to Toril. \nThe Black Dragon mask was crafted to resemble a shiny black color skull, akin to the visage of a black dragons.\nThe wearer of the Black Dragon Mask gained protection from harm caused by acid or physical attacks. Whenever they struck a creature or ignitable object with flame-related magic or any incendiary weapons, their target would catch aflame. The wearer was also granted darkvision and blindsight, along with an the understanding of the Draconic language.\nThe main power of the Black Dragon Mask, along with the other dragon masks, was to transform its wearer into a wyrmspeaker. These individuals were granted thought processes similar to those of dragons, and granted slight influence over their behavior.\nWhen two or more of the masks were brought together, they reformed as the Mask of the Dragon Queen, which combined their respective properties and granted them each upon the wearer. Additional pieces of the five other dragon masks could later be added as well. This valuable artifact was the essential piece needed to complete the ritual that could free Tiamat from the Nine Hells.\nAs of the 1480s DR, the Black Dragon Mask remained in possession of Wyrmspeaker Rezmir of the Cult of the Dragon. It was taken to the cloud giant stronghold Skyreach Castle for a time, before being taken to the cults citadel at the Well of Dragons, and used to summon Tiamat to the Realms for a brief time."
