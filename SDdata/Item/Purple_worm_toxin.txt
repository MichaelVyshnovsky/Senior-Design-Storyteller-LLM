'''Purple worm toxin''' was a strong and rare type of [[poison]], used to coat weapons or needles, extracted from a [[purple worm]]'s gullet.

==Powers==
This toxin was among some of the strongest poisons. A needle dipped in a potent enough vial of purple worm toxin could destroy the victim's brain and collapse their capillaries with a single prick. When the poison was introduced into the victim's bloodstream through an injury, it weakened them, sapping their strength.

==Creation==
Purple worm toxin could be extracted from purple worm unique and highly toxic digestive system. An experienced [[alchemist]] could create a suspension of purple worm slime from a worm's gullet, which later was combined with certain types of alchemical vitriol to create purple worm toxin, to be used by [[assassin]]s and [[rogue]]s.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Krinth]] soldiers from the [[Shadowfell]] carried purple worm toxin in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Viln Tirin]], a [[drow]] bandit from [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
