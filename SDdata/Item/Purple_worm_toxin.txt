Menzoberranzan, Underdark
Purple worm toxin was a strong and rare type of poison, used to coat weapons or needles, extracted from a purple worms gullet.
This toxin was among some of the strongest poisons. A needle dipped in a potent enough vial of purple worm toxin could destroy the victims brain and collapse their capillaries with a single prick. When the poison was introduced into the victims bloodstream through an injury, it weakened them, sapping their strength.
Purple worm toxin could be extracted from purple worm unique and highly toxic digestive system. An experienced alchemist could create a suspension of purple worm slime from a worms gullet, which later was combined with certain types of alchemical vitriol to create purple worm toxin, to be used by assassins and rogues.

* Viln Tirin, a drow bandit from Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.
