        "mainbody": "The '''''Skin of the Forest''''' was a unique set of bark-like [[light armor]] that was created by some mysterious means in [[Neverwinter Wood]] of [[northwest Faerûn]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The ''Skin of the Forest'' possessed magical defenses on par with a set of [[enchanted]] ''+1'' [[leathers|Leather armor]]. Its bark-like material allowed the wearer to blend in with the environment with ease and made their steps more silent. Lastly, the wearer of the ''Skin of the Forest'' could cast the ''[[camouflage]]'' [[spell]] on themselves once per day. This set of armor could only be worn by [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s.",
        "History": "The ''Skin of the Forest's'' first known owner was the druid named [[Henna (druid)|Henna]]. Much of her life was unknown, apart from the story behind how she acquired this item. Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Henna became lost in the depths of the Neverwinter Wood, pursued by a gang of hungry [[troll]]s. As the rain began its downpour, Henna found shelter by an old [[oak]] [[tree]]. Eventually, her pursuers got close. By some strange magic, Henna began feeling a strange warmth that gently enveloped her. The trolls lumbered past the druid, none the wiser. When she emerged from the shelter, she found herself wearing bark-like armor.\n\nEventually, by 1372 DR, the miraculous armor left Henna's possession. Sometime later, the armor found its way into the hands of [[Jacoby]], a smith and merchant who ran his workshop out of the [[Crossroad Keep]] after the [[Shadow War]] of [[Neverwinter]] ended devastating the region."
