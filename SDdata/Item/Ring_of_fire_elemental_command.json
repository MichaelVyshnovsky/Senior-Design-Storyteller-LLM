        "mainbody": "A ring of fire elemental command was a powerful magic item that granted the wearer many benefits related to its element.\nA ring of fire elemental command would appear to be a ring of fire resistance until a specific condition was met which unlocked the rings true potential.\nThese rings provided a boon of fire-related advantages to the wearer. Fire elementals could not approach within  of the wearer unless desired by the wearer. The wearer could attempt to charm any fire elemental they came in contact with, but if the charm failed the creature could easily approach the wearer.\nAny creature from an elemental plane outside of the ring found it slightly more difficult to physically strike and harm the wearer. Additionally, it was much easier for the wearer to strike and harm creatures from other elemental planes even with non-magical weapons.\nThe wearer could converse with any creature native to the Elemental Plane of Fire.\nOnce unlocked, a ring of fire elemental command provided the following powers to the wearer burning hands once per ten minutes, pyrotechnics twice per day, wall of fire once per day, flame strike once per week, and a constant resistance to fire.\nOne drawback to the wielder of one of these rings was a significant vulnerability to water- or cold-based attacks.\nDaltim Flamefist, the famed Halruaan wizard, wore a ring of fire elemental command."
