        "Powers": "The effects of these potions were similar to those of the ''[[luck]]'' [[spell]]. After being consumed, the magic effects lasted for  three minutes, making them more likely to hit their target and avoid affects of an attack or spell, as well as became slightly better in thievery skills, such as pickpocketing and sneaking.",
        "History": "''Potions of luck'' could be found ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1312}} in [[Targos]] of the [[Ten Towns]], and sold in the city of [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}."
