        "mainbody": "Potion of explosions was a volatile magic potion that exploded into a deadly ball of fire upon contact with air or physical disturbance.\nPotion of explosions were kept in safely-sealed air-tight vials. They were usually made of glass or ceramic materials and kept in shock absorbent frames or wrapped in a cloth to keep the glass from accidental breakage.\nDespite its appearance as a seemingly regular harmless potion, drinking the concoction was not recommended. When uncorked, the potion had a high chance of exploding. If swallowed, a small amount of the liquid heated up the imbibers insides, similarly to what drinking a potion of speed felt like. If the entire potion was consumed, the imbiber almost certainly entered the state of full system shock and exploded from the inside. If by some miracle, the explosion was not triggered, the imbiber fell extremely sick, unable to perform any actions for the period of time between three and six hours.\nThese potions were used as a bottled up slightly weaker versions of the fireball spell that upon impact, engulfed between  and  around it in flames.\nAs of the 14 century DR, potions of explosions were extremely rare due to the dangers of holding the end product and dangers of the brewing process."
