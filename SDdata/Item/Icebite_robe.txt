Icebite robes were enchanted wizardly robes created sometime before the late 14 century DR.
These blue robes were declared with delicate glittering ferns of frost.
The wearer of the robes was granted resistance to mundane and magical cold. Once per day, they could cast the armour of Agathys at a higher casting proficiency.
A single icebite robe was interred with its original owner within one of the sarcophagi near Reithwin, long before the area round it was consumed by the shadowcurse in the late 14 century DR.
