'''''Radiant vests of heroism''''' were enchanted suits of [[heavy armor]], encountered in [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
These sets of armor were imbued with a ''+5'' enchantment to the wearer's defense as well as improving the wearer's vitality. ''Radiant vests'' were also blessed with beneficial magics that filled the allies of the wearer with drive and will for victory, similar to the effects of the ''[[heroism]]'' spell.

==Notable Owners==
[[Dragonbait]]: a [[saurial]] paladin and a one-time companion of [[Artus Cimber]] during their foray into the jungles of [[Chult]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
