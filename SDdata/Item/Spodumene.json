        "Description": "Spodumene came in two distinct color families each with their own name. Stones in the pink to purple range were known as kunzite while the emerald-green variety was called hiddenite. Both types were hard, easily cleaved, durable, and produced beautiful large faceted gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.",
        "Powers": "If this stone was sprinkled with holy water (at least three drops) it had the ability to open ''[[wizard lock]]ed'' doors and items on contact. The gemstone was not consumed by this, but the holy water was used up the spodumene had to be anointed for each attempt."
