'''''Lesser ice necklaces of the Ulutiun''''' were [[enchanted]] [[amulet]]s, inspired by the [[Ulutiun]] tribes of the [[Great Glacier]] from the [[Northeast Faerûn]].

==Description==
These necklaces consisted of magically hardened and preserved ice crystals. Each ''ice necklace'' had four large transparent detachable crystals.

==Powers==
Each of the four necklace's crystals were enchanted with powerful ''[[ice storm]]'' spell. When detached and thrown, the crystals exploded with the magics similar to those of the ''ice storm'' spell.

==History==
''Lesser ice necklaces of the Ulutiun'' were created by a half-mad [[sorcerer]] who traveled among the members of the Ulutiun tribes of the Great Glacier. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some of these magic necklaces reached the areas of the [[Sword Coast North]] and the lands of the [[Moonsea]].
