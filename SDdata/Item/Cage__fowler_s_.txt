'''Cages''', also called '''fowler's cages''', were tools sometimes used by [[ranger]]s or woodsmen throughout [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Cages were typically constructed from [[brass]] or [[bamboo]] imported from [[Hungtse province]] in [[Shou Lung]]. They collapsed to a flat panel for easy storage when not in use. A bamboo cage weighed {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}}, while brass cages weighed around {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==History==
These items were used to train [[bird]]s and small [[animal]]s.

Cages were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 8–12 [[gold piece]]s depending on the material used for their construction.
