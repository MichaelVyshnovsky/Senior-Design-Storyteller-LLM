        "mainbody": "A '''scroll''' is a rolled or folded document.  Unlike a tome, a scroll is usually a single piece of parchment.  [[Magic|Magical]] scrolls contain the words of a spell that is released when the caster reads the words on the page.  Magical scrolls may be scribed by [[wizard]]s, [[cleric]]s, or [[druid]]s. \n\nScrolls of the appropriate magic may be read by the classes that can scribe scrolls.  In addition, [[rogue]]s can read magic well enough to activate a scroll and occasionally other classes may have the ability to use scrolls although this may be risky for non magic-users.\n\n{{Quote|Many a Mage has wasted their life seeking scrolls with spells to add to their collection.|[[Volothamp Geddarm]].<ref>{{Cite document/Sword Coast Survival Guide|64}}}}"
