        "mainbody": "he One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen was a ballad about the many near-death escapes of a Cormyrean halfling warrior Ket Stillpond.\nThis ballad was popular among bards and a simple but long-winded tune. Ket the Keen, also known as Ket Stillpond had an uncanny luck for avoiding certain death with nothing but the help of his wits and two enchanted arms, Reliance and Bloodfarmer."
