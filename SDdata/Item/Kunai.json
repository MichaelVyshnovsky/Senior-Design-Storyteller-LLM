        "mainbody": "A kunai or tobi-kunai was a basic handheld utility tool that found use by ninja operatives in Kara-Tur.\nThe kunai was a broad, flat knife that somewhat resembled a trowel. Its blade widened out and then narrowed to a point, taking a spatulate shape.\nThe kunai was a versatile tool and could be used for digging earth, boring wood, and otherwise cutting, wedging, or prying anything that needed it.\nNinjas used the kunai as a general-purpose tool for their illicit work, as a single kunai filled many potential roles. They most notably used it to dig through the earth at surprisingly high speeds."
