'''''Corwin's armor''''' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of [[chainmail]] [[armor]] that was custom-made for Captain [[Schael Corwin]], an officer of the [[Flaming Fist]].

==Description==
Extremely well-crafted and lightweight, especially for chainmail, the armor granted Captain Corwin great freedom of movement and allowed her to move at a brisk pace.

==Powers==
The armor possessed a ''+2 enchantment'' and partially protected its wearer from harmful [[magic]].

==History==
It was commissioned by Schael's father [[Audamar Corwin|Audamar]], and gifted to her when she gained admittance into the Flaming Fist.
