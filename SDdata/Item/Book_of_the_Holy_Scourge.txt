The '''''Book of the Holy Scourge''''' was a sacred book of the [[Church of Ilmater]]. Though not the holiest book of the faith (that honor went to the ''[[Tome of Torment]]''), it was probably the most well-known and useful by [[1370 DR]].

==Abilities==
The ''Book of the Holy Scourge'' contained but a single [[spell]]. Reading it caused spectral [[whip]]s to appear and lash at enemies some distance away.

==History==
Thieves once stole the ''Book of the Holy Scourge'' and attempted to sell it. In response, no less than twenty high priests of the church, from all across [[Faerûn]], appeared by [[magic]] and hurled killing spells at the thieves. Despite their own great power and a hard fight, the thieves were slain.
