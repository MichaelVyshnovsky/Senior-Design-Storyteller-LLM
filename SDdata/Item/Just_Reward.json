        "mainbody": "Just Reward was the personal weapon of the avatars of Osiris, the Mulhorandi deity of death.\nThis weapon resembled a ceremonial flail. Accounts varied on whether it was equivalent to a light horsemans flail or a heavy footmans flail, though the harm it caused was far greater than both.\nJust Reward carried a +3 enchantment and had the same powers as a mace of disruption."
