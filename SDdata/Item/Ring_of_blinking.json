        "mainbody": "ring of blinking or simply a ring of blink, was a magic ring that allowed the user to blink around their current position.\nThese rings were usually inscribed with their own command word. Thus, it was possible that one could be activated by someone other than its wearer, provided they were within  of the ring.\nRings of blinking were activated via command words, which when spoken, would activate the powers of the rings for six minutes. Once activated, the rings would allow the wearers to disappear and reappear within  of their original locations. They had an equal chance to teleport the wearers to any available location forward, backward, left, right, and each direction directly between them. After their activation period, the rings would stop functioning for an hour.\nDuring the Golden Age of Netheril, the effect of these magic rings was usually used in the form of mantles. In 1350 DR, a ring of blinking was stashed in the ruins of the Galena Mountains.\n* Bigby, a wizard of Oerth created one such ring for his hound Bigboy sometime before the late 15 century DR.\n* Ilyana Wyrmmruff\n* Norrin Blackgrove\n* Spite Harrowdale\n* Tiztor"
