A '''fishing rod''', or a '''fishing pole''', was a tool that was used to catch [[fish]]. However, there were many other types of tool for this purpose, such as nets and harpoons.

==Description==
Fishing rods were usually made of wood, and were made of a stick, a line, and a hook. Wooden fishing rods were included in the assortment of general fishing tackle, and they were found in several places over [[Faer√ªn]].

==Powers==
Although most fishing rods were regular items, a wondrous item known as a ''[[pole of angling]]'' could transform into a fully functional rod with a single [[command word]].

==History==
Throughout the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and onward, the [[Companions of the Hall|Companion of the Hall]], [[Regis]], would place the curved stick of his "fishing pole" between two of his toes, and lazily wait for fish to bite.
{{quote
|The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of [[Maer Dualdon]].
|Excerpt from ''[[The Crystal Shard]]''.

In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Rendaril's Emporium]] stocked fishing rods made of [[elf|elven]] [[yew]], and fishing hooks of [[mithral]]. A [[hobgoblin]] who called himself the [[Watermaster]] of [[Grudd Haug]] used a fishing pole to catch fish from a nearby river.

==Notable Owners==
