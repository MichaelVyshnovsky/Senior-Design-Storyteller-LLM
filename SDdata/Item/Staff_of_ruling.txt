The '''''Staff of Ruling''''' was one of the possessions of [[Amun-Re]], the last [[pharaoh]] of [[Bakar]]. When he called down the curse to dry the Athis, he named the staff in his curse.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}}
==Description==
The Staff of Ruling was a golden staff.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|61}}
==Powers==
The staff had three powers that a knowing owner could summon. By hitting the staff against the ground once and then pointing it towards the sky, it could produce a clap of lightning that would strike everyone within 1000 feet with fear. Striking the staff twice against the ground instead allowed the user to spin it in the air; it would generate a ball of lightning that would continue to grow more intense every round that spinning continued. The spinning did not allow the user to move, be hit, or get distracted without the ball of lightning attacking them instead of their target. If struck thrice against the ground, the staff would transform into a large venomous snake aligned the same as the wielder of the staff. As of {{yearlink|1356}}, the staff had five charges of each type left.
==History==
Around the year {{yearlink|300}}, Amun-Re called down a death curse on the [[River Athis]], drying it in retaliation for his own death. The curse was called down in the name of the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]], [[Osiris]], and his own staff of ruling. After his death, Osiris granted the curse, but decided that Amun-Re would not be allowed within Heaven Westward until the Star of Mo-Pelar and his own staff were plundered from his tomb.

In {{yearlink|1356}}, adventurers recovered both items, ending the curse of Amun-Re.{{Cite dragon/424/Martek and the Desert of Desolation|17}}
