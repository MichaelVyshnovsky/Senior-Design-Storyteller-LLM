        "mainbody": "The dire old lute of Pellon Kay was a unique lute that was enchanted by an avatar of Talos, The Storm Lord.\nWhen played, the old lute of Pellon Kay could unleash the dire charm spell once per day, driving those who heard the music into a murderous rage.\nThe dire old lute was the only claim to fame of a mediocre Sembian musician named Pellon Kay. The entertainer had a knack for making enemies, and his acidic personality ensured he partook in a fair share of brawls. Milil looked down on the musician, while Talos was amused by the rowdy minstrel. One day, Pellon Kay was knocked out in a bar brawl with over twenty opponents. An avatar of the Storm Lord witnessed the fight, and as the minstrel laid unconscious, Talos touched Pellons lute, imbuing it with his divine magics.\nAs Pellon discovered the items new magic, he started giddily using it to drive sailors and mercenaries berserk and at each others throats. His luck ran out when a grim-faced adventurer pierced the minstrel with crossbow bolts, ending his life. The dire old lute of Pellon Kay was then tossed overboard into the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThis did not destroy the item, however. As of the , the old lute belonged to a conniving drow merchant, Nym, who traveled the North and sold his magical curios. The drow was still in possession of the lute during his visit to the Wandering Village, east of the town of Kuldahar in 1312 DR."
