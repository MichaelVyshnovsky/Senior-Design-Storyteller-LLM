        "mainbody": "A '''''quarterstaff of battle''''' was a potent magical [[quarterstaff]].",
        "Powers": "A ''+3 [[speed]] quarterstaff'', it was also immune to all cutting and piercing damage and gave the wielder a great boost to his or her ability to disarm opponents.\n\nThe staff could also be used up to three times per day to deflect medium-sized or smaller projectiles for a dozen seconds, including low-level ranged [[spell]]s. This could be used to protect oneself or an adjacent ally, and the staff was not damaged in the act.\n\nOnce a day, the wielder could use the staff to make a powerful \"battlestrike\". Much more damaging than a normal strike, this attack might stun and/or knock over the opponent.\n\nIn addition, the staff could be used once a day to create a ''[[repulsion]]'' effect.",
        "Cost": "This powerful weapon was worth 162,600 [[gold piece]]s.",
