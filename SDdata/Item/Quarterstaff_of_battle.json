        "mainbody": "A quarterstaff of battle was a potent magical quarterstaff.\nA +3 speed quarterstaff, it was also immune to all cutting and piercing damage and gave the wielder a great boost to his or her ability to disarm opponents.\nThe staff could also be used up to three times per day to deflect medium-sized or smaller projectiles for a dozen seconds, including low-level ranged spells. This could be used to protect oneself or an adjacent ally, and the staff was not damaged in the act.\nOnce a day, the wielder could use the staff to make a powerful \"battlestrike\". Much more damaging than a normal strike, this attack might stun and/or knock over the opponent.\nIn addition, the staff could be used once a day to create a repulsion effect.\nThis powerful weapon was worth 162,600 gold pieces.\nFRBÃ¢ton de bataille\nCategoryPlus-3 items\nCategoryStaves\nCategory150000-199999 gold pieces\nb13f4xx0q2ovyczctnzhqgbvmttfyf1"
