'''''Drow spidersilk armor''''' was a magical [[spider-silk]] woven [[chainmail]] that belonged to [[Dreydre Freth]], who was one of the two leaders of the [[House Freth]] operations under [[Myth Drannor]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
''Drow spidersilk armor'' was a lightweight chainmail that was made out of a type of gray fabric that could pass for a simple item of clothing. Upon closer examination, the fibers of the armor were woven using the silk of the spiders of [[Underdark]].

==Powers==
This finely-woven chainmail possessed uncannily resistance to damage, dramatically increasing the wearer's defense. Additionally, a set of ''drow spidersilk armor'' increased the wearer's dexterity and reflexes. These sets of armor also granted the wearer the spell-like ability to cast ''[[web]]''. Like other sets of chainmail armor, these sets given a small chance of the arcane spell failure, even though significantly lower than chainmail made of other materials, making it easily wearable by arcane spellcasters.

==History==
The drow of House Freth found a way into deep catacombs under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in 1369 DR. They used it as an opportunity to outfit an operation to loot ancient elven burial sites for powerful magic, transporting the booty back to [[Underbark]]. The operation was led by [[Greyanna Freth|Greyanna]] and [[Dreydre Freth]]. Eventually a group of heroes sent by [[Elminster]] to stop the activities of [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the ruined elven city were able to defeat both Freth leaders. Upon Dreydre's death, they recovered three powerful enchanted items of drow making: ''[[Venom (dagger)|Venom]]'', ''[[medallion of Lolth]]'', and a set of ''drow spidersilk armor''.
