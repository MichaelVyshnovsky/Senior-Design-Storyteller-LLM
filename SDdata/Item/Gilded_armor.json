        "mainbody": "Gilded armor were elaborately decorated enchanted breastplates, worn by loyal ranking servants or the council of Samarach.\nGilded armor possessed +1 enchantment and enhanced the wearers ability to assert dominance and intimidate creatures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, gilded armor was commonly worn by Captains of the Patrol in the nation of Samarach. In 1374 DR, one of these Captain, along with a band of patrolmen, invaded the hamlet of Nimbre, after hearing of the possible yuan-ti corruption. A group of adventurers hired by a merchant SaSani walked in on the harassment of peaceful villagers. Even though the outcome of the encounter remained unclear, some said that the gilded armor mightve changed hands that day."
