        "mainbody": "Potions of longevity were magical potions that reduced the drinkers age by a number of years, potentially extending their lifespan.\nA potion of longevity was an amber-colored liquid. An examination from outside its sealed vial revealed a number of objects suspended in the liquid a scorpions tail, an adders fang, a dead spider, and a still-beating heart. Upon opening the vial, the suspended objects disappeared.\nWhen a creature drank a potion of longevity, its age was reduced by between 7 and 12 years. The potion could not make an individual return to an age less than 13 years old.\nRepeated use of potions of longevity was dangerous, however. After each subsequent use, there was a small but growing risk that the potion might instead increase the drinkers age. After the tenth use, age reduction became impossible and the potion could only make the drinker older.\nIt was rumored that the long age of Ahghairon was due either to his finding a cache of potions of longevity or to having developed the ability to brew his own.\nBy 1362 DR Maligor, the Zulkir of Alteration in Thay has been brewing and consuming his own version of the potions of longevity for decades prolonging his life. The liquid of his creation was pale, pearly green and quite viscous. Consuming the potion caused the drinker tremendous pain burning them from the inside. The result was arguably worth it as it made the drinker younger by decades.\nAfter the war between the city of Ravens Bluff and warlord Myrkyssa Jelan of the , aging High Priestess Morlain of the Palace of Passion was trying to procure an elixir of longevity to remain in the position of power and beauty.\n* Maligor\n* Arghorst Talandor, a magister.\n* The guildmaster Rial Potjian owned several of these potions.\n* Mirt claimed that he and Durnan drank at least six potions of longevity each.[https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcaivjAu0ww&ab_channel=RodInFlagon Rod in Flagon Episode 27 Mirt the Merciless with ]Ed Greenwood\n* Harpers archmage Zelraun Roaringhorn kept his youth with these potions.\n* The witch Setara attempted to use these potions to maintain her youth and beauty however a badly made potion aged her greatly."
