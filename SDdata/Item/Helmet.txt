A '''helmet''', or '''helm''', was a piece of armor used for defending the head and face of the wearer. They were used all around [[Toril]] and could also be used as martial weapons.

==Description==
Helmets came in all shapes and sizes, and could be [[magic|magically]] enchanted. There were several distinct types of helmets and they were an essential part of most heavy armor. Many could be separated into two categories, closed-faced and open-faced, which referred to how much visibility they offered the wearer in place of protection.

==As a Weapon==
As well as the standard usage of a helmet, to protect the head, they were often used for attacking, mainly by [[dwarves]]. [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] wore a one-horned helmet<ref>, and [[Ivan Bouldershoulder]] used a helmet with [[stag]] horns attached.<ref> Both of them used it to headbutt their foes to push them away, or for raw damage.
* Horned helmet: A standard helmet with bull's horns attached. It dealt high damage when charging a foe with it.
* Spiked helmet: A helmet with a single large spike protruding out of the front. It also dealt high damage when charging a foe. It was less costly than a horned helmet.

* [[Crested helmet]], an open-faced style of helmet that was distinguished by a tufted crest that went across its front axis.{{Cite adventurers league/The Iron Baron|8}}
* [[Great helm]], a type of helmet that covered the entirety of its wearer's head.
* [[Morion]], an open-faced helmet with a brim and crest.
