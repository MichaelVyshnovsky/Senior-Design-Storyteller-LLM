        "Description": "This stone was usually gritty and its major use was for sharpening. Occasionally the grit was fine enough to make large cabochon [[ornamental stones]]. Sharpstone's hardness made it difficult to polish to full luster.",
        "Powers": "This stone could be used to increase the area of effect of a spell with a corresponding decrease in damage (or duration if the spell did not have a damage effect). Any size or amount of sharpstone could be used and was consumed in the casting.",
