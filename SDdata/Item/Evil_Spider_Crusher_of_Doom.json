        "Powers": "This club had a ''+2'' enchantment, but when wielded against [[spider]]s its effectiveness doubled into a ''+4'' enchantment.",
        "History": "This club was designed by an arachnophobic [[halfling]] named [[Caligope]], who sought to finally confront both his fear and the evil [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] [[Eli-Makar]], whose wizard tower was filled with a variety of abnormal arachnid minions.\n\nOver time this weapon changed hands, until ending up in the possession of the blacksmith [[Conlan]] in [[Kuldahar]] in [[1281 DR]]."
