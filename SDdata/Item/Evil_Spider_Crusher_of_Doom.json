        "mainbody": "The Evil Spider Crusher of Doom was a unique enchanted club.\nThis club had a +2 enchantment, but when wielded against spiders its effectiveness doubled into a +4 enchantment.\nThis club was designed by an arachnophobic halfling named Caligope, who sought to finally confront both his fear and the evil elven wizard Eli-Makar, whose wizard tower was filled with a variety of abnormal arachnid minions.\nOver time this weapon changed hands, until ending up in the possession of the blacksmith Conlan in Kuldahar in 1281 DR."
