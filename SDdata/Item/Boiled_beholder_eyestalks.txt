'''Boiled beholder eyestalks''' was a common and gruesome dish of [[githyanki]] cuisine found in gith cr√®ches and the [[Astral Sea]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Even in death, the beholder's eyes regard you with a mix of hauteur and suspicion.''}}

==Description==
This straightforward dish was made using [[beholder]] eyestalks, severed at the base and boiled whole, skin and eyeballs included. They were served whole, plated on large trays, and garnished with sprigs of [[parsley]] and [[lemon]] wedges, presumably for drizzling over this gourmet meat.
