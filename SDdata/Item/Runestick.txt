A '''''runestick''''' was a [[magic]] [[wand]] made by a [[druid]] to store a certain number of [[spell]]s for later use.

==Description==
''Runesticks'' were made of [[oak]] and measured around 12 inches (30 centimeters) in length. They had runes carved into their surfaces and were bound in [[mistletoe]] or [[holly]].

==Powers==
A ''runestick'' served as a repository for a limited number of druidic spells that could then be cast directly from the wand itself, similar in general principle to a ''[[ring of spell storing]]''. It could store a maximum of five spell levels, and only druids of sufficient power could fashion such an item. After carving the ''runestick'', the druid would then cast the desired spells directly into it to be stored. The wand could then be used by any druid when the proper word of command was spoken. The power of the magic contained in the ''runestick'' was equal to that of the druid who originally created it.

==Restrictions==
The lifespan of a ''runestick'' was limited. A month after it was created, the wand deteriorated to inert dust whether the spells stored in it were used or not, and it could not be recharged before that time. The only non-druids capable of using the wand were maidens of "pure heart" (provided they knew the command word), but in such cases the magic was only half as effective.

==History==
In [[1358 DR]],<ref group="note" name="PresentYear">'''The explanation for this date is divided into three points:'''<br />'''(1)''' Page 16 of ''The Shattered Statue'' (February, 1988) describes the destruction of [[Phlan]] by [[dragon]]s as having occurred "several years ago." Since the conflict "[[Dragon Run]]" did not exist until ''[[The Moonsea]]'', this has to be referring to the [[Flight of the Dragon]] ([[1356 DR]]), which was introduced in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]''.<br />'''(2)''' ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'' (August, 1988), is set in [[1358 DR]] and has [[Amelior Amanitas]] refer to its events in past tense.<br />'''(3)''' Page 18 of ''The Shattered Statue'' describes the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as having long had no presence in [[Volkumburgh Vale]], but ''[[TSR Jam 1999]]'' has the cult re-establishing themselves there in [[1359 DR]].<br />'''Conclusion:''' All together, this info suggests that ''The Shattered Statue'' takes place in 1358 DR. in the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]] some time prior to the [[Feast of the Moon]], the [[Volkumburgh]] shepherd [[Deker]] was clearing out the [[High Pasture]] in hopes of constructing a new barn. While doing so one of his [[sheep]] walked up to and bit a ''runestick'' that made it seemingly disappear. Later on a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Suzail]], seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled [[Awtawmatawn]] on behalf of [[Amelior Amanitas]], came to enquire about this incident and found that the ''runestick'' acted as a two-way ''[[portal]]'' to another ''runestick'' near the ruins of the [[College of Rune Magics]].

==Notable Users of Runesticks==
===Groups===
* The [[adept]]s of the [[College of Rune Magics]] practiced a form of [[rune magic]] that heavily revolved around the use of ''runesticks'' in casting both spells and [[ritual]]s. They were known to construct ''runesticks'' from [[ash]]wood, [[aspen]]wood, [[cedar]]wood, [[chestnut]]-wood, gilded metal, [[silver]]ed metal, [[mistletoe]], [[oak]], [[pine]]wood, and [[yew]]-wood.
===Individuals===
* [[Genna Moonsinger]], as the Great Druid of [[Moonshae Isles|Moonshae]], was able to enchant ''runesticks'' with up to twenty spell levels instead of the normal five. She gave one of these to [[Robyn Kendrick]] to use in her battles against the evil forces that threatened Moonshae.

==Usages==
* Some used ''runesticks'' to help them read omens.
