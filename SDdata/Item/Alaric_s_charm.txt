'''''Alaric's charm''''' was a simple-looking enchanted necklace that belonged to one of the members of [[House Ammath]] in the days of ancient [[Myth Drannor]].

==Powers==
''Alaric's charm'' granted its wearer enhanced intelligence in exchange for the diminished constitution.

==History==
''Alaric's charm'' itself dated all the way to re-[[Weeping War]] Myth Drannor. The owner of the magic necklace was buried in the tomb under [[Glim-Gardens]] while wearing the charm. Eventually, one of many creatures that scavenged through the ruins desecrated the tomb and took the necklace for themselves.

In [[1369 DR]], ''Alaric's charm'' found its way into the possession of a [[dark naga]] that made a home in the tombs under the Ammath mansion. The charm, along with the ''[[gauntlets of ogre size]]'', the ''[[boots of the tortoise]]'' was locked away in naga's treasure chests.
