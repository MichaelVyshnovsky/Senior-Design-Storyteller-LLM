        "mainbody": "Martial exertion gloves were enchanted gloves that allowed the wearer to push past their physical threshold in the heat of battle.\nThe wearer of the gloves could activate the gloves magic once between two periods of rest of at least four hours. They allowed the wearer to push their bodys limits in the heat of battle so much that they inadvertently hurt themselves in the process. In exchange, they were able to land additional attack on their opponents and double their movement speed.\nIn the , a pair of martial exertion gloves was sold by merchant Bumpnagel of the Clan Ironhand, a deep gnome clan of artificers from Baldurs Gate."
