        "mainbody": "'''''Martial exertion gloves''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that allowed the wearer to push past their physical threshold in the heat of battle.\n\n{{quote|''You drop and give me thirty you sumbitch; you think a bugbear's gonna roll over and let you rub his tummy? One two three four - keep going maggot! Stronger, better, tougher!''|Any [[Sword Coast]] drill sergeant, invariably}}",
        "Powers": "The wearer of the gloves could activate the gloves' magic once between two periods of rest of at least four hours. They allowed the wearer to push their body's limits in the heat of battle so much that they inadvertently hurt themselves in the process. In exchange, they were able to land additional attack on their opponents and double their movement speed.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''martial exertion gloves'' was sold by merchant [[Bumpnagel]] of the [[Clan Ironhand]], a [[deep gnome]] clan of [[artificer]]s from [[Baldur's Gate]]."
