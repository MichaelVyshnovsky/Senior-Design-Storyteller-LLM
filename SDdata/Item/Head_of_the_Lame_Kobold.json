        "mainbody": "The Head of the Lame Kobold was an enchanted helmet made out of the head of Sholsarrath the Lame, a dim-witted kobold warlock of the Skulking Dragon clan, some years before the late 14 century DR.\nThe Head of the Lame Kobold possessed enchantments that were only usably by warlocks. The helmet boosted the wearers charisma at the cost of the wearers intelligence. Additionally, the wearer could cast the fear spell thrice per day.\nSholsarrath was a kobold shaman who, in order to avoid a grisly death, entered a warlocks pact with the demon Yargulbuzul, who offered him power and, subsequently, the leadership of the clan.

The dim-witted warlock agreed frantically to Yargulbuzuls demands – the kobolds head. When the five adventurers reached the shamans lair, they witnessed a happy imp decapitating Sholsarrath and carrying his soul to the Abyss.\nSometime later, Sholsarrath the Lames head was fashioned into an enchanted mask fashioned to be worn by warlocks.
