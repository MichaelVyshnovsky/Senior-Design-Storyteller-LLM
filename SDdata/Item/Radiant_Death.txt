Radiant Death was an epic powerful magical katana from Kara-Tur that may have appeared in Faerûn in the mid–14 century DR.
Radiant Death was the personal weapon of the famed warrior Viromoto, who fought a hundred duels and was victorious each time. However, he slowly came to mistrust Radiant Death, until he ultimately switched to another weapon for one fateful duel in which he suffered his first, and final, defeat.
Circa 1372 DR, Radiant Death was in the hands of a creature called Gargamesh in Cania in the Nine Hells.
The weapon was incredibly well-crafted and razor-sharp, yet felt almost too light. It had a dark and jagged blade.
It was a +6 keen katana that dealt more devastating injuries when it scored critical strikes on foes. However, it felt so light in weight that even a weapon master found it difficult to wield effectively. This greatly impeded their ability to defend themselves. It was also highly exclusive only a weapon master could wield it, and only a weapon master focused in the katana would use it.
