'''''The Shield of the Revenant''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[shield]] wielded by [[paladin]]s who dedicated themselves to [[The Triad]] – [[Torm]], [[Tyr]], and [[Ilmater]].

==Description==
This shield was decorated with red and white enamel.

==Powers==
This item was ''[[bless]]ed'' by the deities of the Triad to be wielded against the [[undead]] but those who stood in the front lines. The shield's holy magic fortified the area before its owners entered battle with the forces of evil.

==History==
''The Shield of the Revenant'' was used in central and northern [[Faerûn]] long before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. Its most known wielder was [[Kardod]] of Tyr, who died battling an overwhelming horde of [[wight]]s. After Kardod's death, ''The Shield of the Revenant'' was sold by the [[necromancer]] [[Shanin]] to a [[priest]] of [[Myrkul]]. Subsequently, in [[1281]], ''The Shield of the Revenant'' ended up in the hands of [[Edion Caradoc]], an aging [[necromancer]] who resided on the [[Burial Isle]] of [[Icewind Dale]], among numerous other enchanted items, which were flush with magic.
