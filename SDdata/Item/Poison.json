        "mainbody": "A poison was a substance that damaged or affected the abilities of a creature, either instantly or over time. A poison could be administered by contact, inhalation, ingestion, or through a wound. The ability to use poison effectively was a skill that had to be learned and a person utilising such substances had a small chance of poisoning themselves. The effects of poisons varied widely, but common ones included paralysis, sleep, loss of ability, injury, or death.\nPoisoned creatures had a chance to avoid or resist the effects of a poison, and some had natural resistances or immunities to poisons. or druidic magic. Some poisons wore off after a period of time and had little or no lasting effect, but without help, it could take days to recover. \nPoisons were often rare, expensive, and illegal to purchase. Crafting a poison from natural ingredients, or harvesting poisonous substances and venoms from creatures was also a risky endeavor that usually required knowledge of nature and some specialized equipment.\n* Some drows from Bregan Daerthe used poisonous pistols to defeat their foes."
