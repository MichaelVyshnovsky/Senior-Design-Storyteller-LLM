        "mainbody": "heasant tail soup was a dish originating from Elturel in the Western Heartlands. It was an Elturian favorite circa 1366 DR.\nIt was a soup made of a thick simmered meat stock and served hot. In quality establishments like the Phontyrs Unicorn inn in Elturel, this was made from pheasant or other small game fowl depending on availability. In dishonest places, like The Raging Lion in Scornubel, it could well include small rodents or what other meat happened to come to hand. \nIt was actually named for the three pheasant feathers standing upright beside each bowl as adornment. Volo described it as one of the more adventurous dishes at the Phontyrs Unicorn."
