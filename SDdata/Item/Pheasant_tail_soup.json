        "mainbody": "'''Pheasant tail soup''' was a dish originating from [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was an Elturian favorite ''circa'' [[1366 DR]].\n\nIt was a [[wikipedia:soup|soup]] made of a thick simmered meat [[wikipedia:Stock (food)|stock]] and served hot. In quality establishments like the [[Phontyr's Unicorn]] inn in Elturel, this was made from [[pheasant]] or other small game fowl depending on availability. In dishonest places, like [[The Raging Lion]] in [[Scornubel]], it could well include small [[rodent]]s or what other meat happened to come to hand. \n\nIt was actually named for the three [[pheasant]] feathers standing upright beside each [[bowl]] as adornment. [[Volo]] described it as one of the more adventurous dishes at the Phontyr's Unicorn."
