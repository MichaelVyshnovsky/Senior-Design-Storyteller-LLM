{{Quote|Never listen to a tale from a wyrm&mdash;they tend to drag on!|An example of the corny jokes associated with the ''jester's bracers''}}

==Powers==
Whoever wore the ''bracers'' was forced to continually tell corny jokes, to the chagrin of themselves and others. Once equipped, the ''bracers'' could only be removed through a [[spell]] of ''[[remove curse]]''.

==History==
The ''jester's bracers'' were originally a standard pair of protective bracers owned by a traveling [[bard]] famous for his quick wit and sharp tongue. While performing at a rickety inn on the road to [[Shadowdale]] one rainy night, he drew the ire of an old woman in the audience. She exclaimed, "You think it clever to insult and belittle others? Do so, then, for as long as you live!", thereby cursing the bard's bracers. He was forced to consult a [[wizard]] to have them removed.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the ''jester's bracers'' were owned by the [[djinni]] merchant [[Nazramu]].
