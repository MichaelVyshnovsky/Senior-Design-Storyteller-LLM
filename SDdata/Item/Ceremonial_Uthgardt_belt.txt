Ceremonial Uthgardt belts were enchanted belts created for the wild Uthgardt folk.
These belts were ensorcelled to protect their wearers from any types of death magic and diseases, and improved their fortitude.
A long time before the , a long-forgotten druid conclave infected Uthgardt barbarians with a virulent pox in order to control the tribes. The sickness spread out of control and threatened complete Uthgardt extinction. To heroically resolve the problem the druids themselves created, the conclave crafted numerous ceremonial Uthgardt belts and dispersed them among barbarian leaders. Thanks to the belts, Uthgardt tribes survived however, this only made their distrust of outsiders more extreme.
By the late 14 century DR, ceremonial Uthgardt belts could be found in several locations across the Sword Coast North, including Beorunnas Well, and the city of Hillsfar of the Moonsea.
* Gorgotha, a dragon who resided in the Spine of the World and held grave animosity towards Klauth, a red dragon, circa 1372 DR.
* Yusam of Beorunnas Well, had one of these belts in his inventory circa 1372 DR.
