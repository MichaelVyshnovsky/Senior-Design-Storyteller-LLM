A '''''ring of three wishes''''' was an extremely powerful magic ring.

==Description==
A ''ring of three wishes'' was set with three rubies when it was initially created.

==Powers==
The ''ring'' contained three charges. Each charge could be spent by its wearer to cast the ''[[wish]]'' spell.

==Notable ''Rings of Three Wishes''==
Sometime before the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], a ''ring of three wishes'' with two charges remaining was acquired by [[Omar McDauphin]], an extremely introverted and fearful inhabitant of the city of [[Trondheim]] on the [[Oman]] island in the [[Moonshaes]]. Oman cast ''wish'' asking for complete isolation, that his possessions never be robbed, and that his family never be harmed. The ''wish'' caused him to be transformed into a [[stone giant]], for his family to be turned into part of a gang of assassins, for his entire [[Caer Windlauer|estate]] to be thrown into space orbiting [[the sun]], and for the final charge in the ring to be destroyed.

[[Szass Tam]] was known to always have a ''ring of three wishes'' on his person wherever he traveled.
