'''Candles''' were employed in an enormous variety of purposes throughout the [[Realms]], by adventurers, [[cleric]]s, [[wizard]]s, and common folk alike. They were often snuffed out by [[candle snuffer]]s.

==Description==
Typical adventurers' candles burned for approximately 1 hour. They could shed light that was useful to aid vision out to a range of up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} and cost 1 [[cp]] each in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were an integral part of [[burglar's pack]]s, [[entertainer's pack]]s, and [[priest's pack]]s.

Different varieties of adventuring candles were also sold by [[Aurora's Emporium]] that illuminated out to a range of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} for up to 4 hours. They came in a variety of sizes and shapes, including twisted. Their starting length was {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} and starting diameter was {{SI|0.5| in|c|long=yes}}, but they were available in longer and thicker sizes for additional prices.

Specialty candles, however, ran a much wider variety of prices, sizes, and applications. Certain types of candles were used to mark the passage of time, while others decorated temples or were used as a healing aid for the infirm. Some candles employed by [[cleric]]s included:
* Altar candles that varied in size between {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} and {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}}; the larger varieties could burn for weeks;
* 12-hour candles that could be inscribed with marks on their sides that were reached once every half hour;
* Vigil candles that were infused with [[incense]] and were lit next to injured patients.

Other specialty varieties of candles were also mandatory components in [[wizard]]s' laboratories, and were available uncolored or in a variety of colors, including red, black, and yellow. Candles relevant to wizards included:
* Timekeeping candles that were notched to mark the passage of half-hours;
* Incense candles that cleared the laboratory's air;
* [[Vial]] heaters, steady-burning candles that burned for long times;
* Tapers that provided illumination for reading.
A complete laboratory required at least 30 candles of each type to operate properly.

Candles that were typically used in households were also available in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and materials. They could be made from [[beeswax]], tallow,{{Cite dragon/179/Magic by Candlelight|17}} And they could be colored blue, green, red, white, or yellow. Different shapes included:
* Tall, thin tapers;
* Short and thick votives;
* Knobbed candles, which could also be used to mark the passage of time. The knobs could mark hours or days.

Candles were also employed instead of a [[wick]] in certain types of [[lantern]]s, such as [[self-dousing lantern]]s.

A lit candle onboard a [[spelljammer]] that entered the [[phlogiston]] immediately exploded into a small ''[[fireball]]'' {{SI|4|in|c|long=yes}} in diameter.

==Powers==
Incense-infused vigil candles lasted for about 8 hours. Their curative properties slightly accelerated the recovery of injured patients.

===Candle Magic===

{{Main|Candle magic}}
[[Mystic]]s in the Realms were capable of using their knowledge of [[herb]]s to manufacture magically enchanted candles. The material was laborious to produce: every 10 minutes of burning time took roughly 3 days to create, so that a candle that burned for up to an hour and a half took up almost one entire month to produce. These magic candles, after burning for their full duration in the presence of a subject within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}, granted a variety of effects, some of which increased with longer exposition times. Mystic-produced candles included:
* ''[[Love candle]]s'', red candles that produced an effect similar to that of a ''[[philter of love]]''.
* ''[[Protection candle]]s'', blue candles that created the effect of a ''[[protection from evil]]'' or ''[[protection from good]]'' [[spell]].
* ''[[Truth candle]]s'', purple candles that forced a subject to truthfully answer a number of questions that depended on the burning duration.
* ''[[Healing candle]]s'', gold-colored candles that provided magical healing that increased for longer burning durations.
* ''[[Telepathy candle]]s'', yellow candles that permitted [[Telepathy|telepathic]] communication between a mystic and the subject, for as long as the candle burned.
* ''[[Fortune candle]]s'', green candles that created the effect of a ''[[stone of good luck]]'' for a number of days that depended on the burning duration.
* ''[[Purification candle]]s'', white candles that created the effects of the ''[[remove curse]]'', ''[[abjure]]'', or ''[[banishment]]'' spells, or that provided the benefits of drinking an ''[[elixir of health]]''.
* ''[[Empowerment candle]]s'', silver candles that empowered the subject's spells in an effect similar to an ''[[incense of meditation]]''.
* ''[[Curse candle]]s'', black candles that inflicted a number of [[curse]]s on the subject.

==History==
Temples of [[Lathander]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century DR typically used two {{SIAdj|6|ft}} altar candles per fortnight.

==Reputation==
The [[holy symbol]] of [[Deneir]] consisted of a lit candle above an open eye.

==Notable Candles==
* ''[[Candle of the deep]]'', a magical candle that burned underwater.
* ''[[Candle of invocation]]'', a powerful candle dedicated to a certain [[deity]] that, when lit, greatly benefited nearby followers and sympathizers of that deity.
* ''[[Candle of truth]]'', a white tallow candle that created a ''[[zone of truth]]'' effect while it burned.
* ''[[Ritual candle]]'', a magical, inexhaustible candle that assisted with the casting of certain [[ritual]]s.
