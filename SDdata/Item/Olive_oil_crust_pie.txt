'''Olive oil crust pies''' were savory handfoods served at the [[Oak-Father's Boon]], the best inn in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
[[Olive oil]] crust pies were types of savory [[tart]]s sold in various kinds. Some of the pies available were called "upland tart", "forester's tart", "streamside", and "bounty". Pie stuffings were local and varied seasonally. They often followed an appetizer dish of simple grilled [[leek]]s.

==History==
Olive oil crust pies were a popular treat at the Boon in the mid-to-late-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were favorably mentioned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s rave review of the inn in one of his published travel guides. These little bites were beloved by many traveling merchants who often purchased them in a sack-full to snack on on the road.
