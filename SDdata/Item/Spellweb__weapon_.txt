'''''Spellweb''''' were [[magic]] [[weapon]]s, that were rumored to be used as tools to defend the island nation of [[Lantan]] from pirates and invaders.

==Powers==
These weapons fed off magic, [[enchantment]]s, and [[spell]]s, unleashed and even those spells that were still held within a [[mage]]'s mind. Any spellcaster that entered the area of a ''spellweb'' was rendered ''[[feeblemind]]ed'' and lost all magical abilities for a period of time, or even forever.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[hin]] [[thief]] named [[Jonslyn Windtongue]] managed to steal one of the ''spellwebs''. The [[Ayrorch]], the Council of Twelve, dispatched the [[Hands of Gond]] agents to find the halfling thief and return what was stolen by all means.
