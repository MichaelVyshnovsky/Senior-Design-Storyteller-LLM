Following it, during the celebration, the fellow members of the Circle, [[Otiluke]] and [[Bigby]] pranked Tenser, but, thanks to the hood, they found their [[vodka]] glasses ensorcelled with a spell that transformed their earlobes into sassy [[pixie]]s.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Hood of the Weave'' ended up in the hands of a powerful [[mummy lord]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] â€“ the [[Mystic Carrion]]. The hood and its [[undead]] master could be found in [[Philgrave's Mansion]] in the Gate's [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
