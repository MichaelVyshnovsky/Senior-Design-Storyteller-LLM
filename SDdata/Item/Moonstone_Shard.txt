The Moonstone Shard was a masterpiece statue standing in the House of the Moon temple to Sel√ªne in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
The statue represented one of the Shards, The Moonstone Shard was life-sized and fashioned from no less than 10,000 tiny moonstones, all held in place by magic alone. The entire statue swayed and glittered.
It was displayed in a large dedicated chamber on the fourth floor of the House of the Moon. Two Knights of the Half Moon stood guard here constantly and patrols were frequent.
Legend held that the Moonstone Shard would animate to defend the temple if it came under attack. If it did, it would be a unique glassteeled golem, comparable to an iron golem.
Of all the works of art in the House of the Moon, the Moonstone Shard was by far the most valuable. Circa 1370 DR, it was estimated to be worth no less than 100,000 gold pieces, if there was even any buyer for it.
