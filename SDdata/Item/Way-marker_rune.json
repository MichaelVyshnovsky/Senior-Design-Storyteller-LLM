        "mainbody": "ay-marker runes were one of the three types of drow runes, the other two being house defense glyphs and sacred glyphs.\nDrow runes were always limned in black, be it with ink, paste, or inlay. The runes were elegant. \nThey were used in places where the drow patrolled but did not live and were found in side-caverns, alcoves, and other places where said patrols could rest use as a defensive spot against monsters.\nUnlike other drow runes, way-marker runes were safe for all drow but harmful to all who were not of the drow race. Their power remained intact for years, the exact length depended on the creators skill.\nThese runes had only one power with the following eight being the most common. However, drow runecasters were known to create special ones for chosen locations.\nBy the 14 century DR, the technology to create way-marker runes was already old.\nThe secret of how to crate way-marker runes was one of the best-kept ones and was not common knowledge outsider of chosen members of the clergies or noble households."
