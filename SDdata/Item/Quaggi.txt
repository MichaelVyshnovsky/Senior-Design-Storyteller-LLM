A '''quaggi''' was a structure found in [[Iulutiun]] villages.

==Description==
Traditionally, Iulutiuns gathered for communal feasts and celebrations in outdoor settings. However, during inclement weather, they resorted to using a quaggi, which was a feast house specifically designed for such occasions. The quaggi was a spacious dome, towering between {{SIrange|15|20|ft|long=yes}} in height and boasting a diameter of at least {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. At the center of the dome, there was a prominent [[Ulutiun dictionary#Q|''quidlirin'']], a communal hearth.

Inside the quaggi, two ledges constructed from snow served as seating arrangements. The first ledge, positioned along the interior wall, stood approximately {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} tall, while a second ledge sat just below it, measuring around {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} in height. Typically, a village was equipped with one quaggi for approximately every hundred adults, ensuring ample space for gatherings and festivities.
