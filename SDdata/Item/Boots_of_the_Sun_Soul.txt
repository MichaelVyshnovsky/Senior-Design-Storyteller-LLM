Boots of the Sun Soul were enchanted boots that originated from Kara-Tur and designed to be worn by monks.
Boots of the Sun Soul, when worn by monks, enhanced their movements making it much harder for them to be hit by the opponent, additionally, they increased the monks dexterity.
The original pair of the Boots of the Sun Soul belonged to a wise old wandering monk named Teki Jin from the far-off land of Kara-Tur. Eventually, growing in wisdom and strength along his journeys, he started accumulating apprentices who followed his teachings. When a student of his finished the training and went on their way, Teki Jin gifted the departing student with a  pair of boots of the Sun Soul. The gift was supposed to remind the leaving students of the importance of the wisdom of the past.
When Teki Jin passed away of old age, copies of the boots of the Sun Soul started appearing in merchants inventories, each claiming the authenticity of the items. In reality, most of these boots that could be found around the Sword Coast in the late 14 century were nothing but forgeries. They did, however, possess the enchantments and were worth the coin.
