        "mainbody": "The Chariot of Re, which was also called the Chariot of Ra, was a powerful artifact that was constructed by an obcure god named Ptah.\nThe chariot was made from pure gold and emblazoned with the god Res symbol of a solar disc set against an ankh.\nThe Chariot of Re was capable of moving at great speed without the need for any animal to pull it. Anyone fighting from the chariot was extremely difficult to strike in combat because of the speed at which they moved. Additonally, riders within the chariot enjoyed a large boost to their resistance to all forms of magic.\nAnyone struck by someone riding in the chariot was blinded for 20–80 minutes. Viewing the chariot had positive effects for allies within , boosting their morale while having the opposite effect to enemies.\nThree of these chariots existed at one point—one for Ra, Horus-Re, and Osiris. The Chariot of Re was the only one known to exist following the Orcgate Wars."
