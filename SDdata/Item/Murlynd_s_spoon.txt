Murlynds spoon was a type of enchanted spoon capable of creating a nourishing gruel.
These utensils were usually fashioned from horns.
When placed within a smaller empty container, Murlynds spoon would create enough gruel to fill the container. The gruel was warm and relatively flavorless, but quite nourishing. The spoon could create enough gruel to feed up to four human-sized individuals for the entire day.
Specialty priests of Waukeen called goldeyes had a chance of receiving a Murlynds spoon as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy.
