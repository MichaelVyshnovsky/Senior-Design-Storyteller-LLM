        "mainbody": "'''''Amulet of Valindra's favor''''' were [[enchanted]] [[amulet]]s and [[cloak]] clasps that were created to be boons for [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s most loyal servants in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The wearers of the amulets received boosts to their vitality, ability to land lucky devastating strikes, accuracy, and constitution. When an ''amulet of Valindra's favor'' was worn together with a ''[[belt of Valindra's guard]]'' and a ''[[shard of Valindra's crown]]'', the amulet greatly fortified the wearer's resistance to enthralling and controlling [[spell]]s and, in turn, strengthened the wearer's own such spells.",
        "History": "These amulets were given out to Valindra Shadowmantle's lieutenants as a sign of favor. Despite their empowering magics, Valindra could use the amulets to strangle those lieutenants who displeased her. After Valindra's defeat by the defenders of Neverwinter in the late 15{{th}} century DR, some of these amulets were recovered from the villains' bodies."
