        "mainbody": "The '''''Molten Throne''''' was a magic throne used by [[Nar-Aidiya]] within [[Krak al-Mazhar]]â€”the secret fortress of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}",
        "Description": "The Throne sat upon a stone column in the [[Infernal Hall]] that measured 10 feet in diameter and usually sat 10 feet above the ground. The height of the column could be altered at any time by a mere thought from the Throne's occupant. The column could also rotate a full 360 degrees by using basalt studs found on the throne's arms. A blazing moat filled with ever-burning ''[[wall of fire|walls of fire]]'' surrounded the base of the column.\n\nThe Throne itself was a translucent pillar of flame that appeared to be frozen in time.",
        "History": "The ''Molten Throne'' was created by a [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[artist genie]] at the request of the Sultan of the Efreet, [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan]], to given as a gift to [[Nar-Aidiya]].",
        "Powers": "Whoever was seated upon the Throne was completely immune to all forms of fire. The occupant could cast ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[chastise]]'', and ''[[flame of justice]]'' at will. Once per day the Throne could be used as a ''[[rod of rulership]]'', forcing the occupant's will upon their servants.\n\nAnyone sitting on the ''Molten Throne'' who was not a member of the Brotherhood of the True Flame was instantly blasted by a powerful ''[[flame strike]]''.\n\nEvery time the Throne's occupant used one of the powers there was a small cumulative chance that anyone who was not a committed worshiper of [[Kossuth]] would be turned to worship him, also turning them toward sinister behavior.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that the ''Molten Throne'' could only be destroyed if attacked by the whirlwinds of 1,000 [[djinn]]."
