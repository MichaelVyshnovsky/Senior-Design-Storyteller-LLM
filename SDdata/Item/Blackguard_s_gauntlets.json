When these [[champion]]s fail and falter, their hands that would guide turn cold, hard, and piercing.''}}",

Additionally, the gauntlets increased the wearer's physical strength and magically guided their hands and weapons towards the targets, similarly to that of ''+1'' offensive enchantments.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''blackguard's gauntlets'' were worn by the guardian death knight called [[That Which Watches]], who, along with [[That Which Guards]] and [[That Which Lurks (death knight)|That Which Lurks]], guarded the entrance to the chamber of the [[Bhaalist]] [[Murder Tribunal]] in the [[Undercellar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]."
