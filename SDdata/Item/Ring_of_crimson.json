        "mainbody": "Rings of Crimson were common minor magic items found across the Sword Coast in the late 14 century DR.\nThese rings were imbued with simple enchantments that made them glow with soft red light, illuminating the area of  around them.\nBy 1372 DR, these common pieces of enchanted jewelry were found across many pockets, fingers, and merchant stalls across the Sword Coast, and the Moonsea, and in cites such as Neverwinter and Daggerford. Especially popular among adventurers, freeing their hand for weapons and tools, instead of holding lanterns and torches. One of these rings was found in an ancient crypt in the Brush of Barbs of Delimbiyr Vale."
