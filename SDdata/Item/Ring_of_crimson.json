        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], these common pieces of enchanted jewelry were found across many pockets, fingers, and merchant stalls across the Sword Coast, and the [[Moonsea]], and in cites such as [[Neverwinter]] and [[Daggerford]]. Especially popular among adventurers, freeing their hand for weapons and tools, instead of holding [[lantern]]s and [[torch]]es. One of these rings was found in an ancient crypt in the [[Brush of Barbs]] of [[Delimbiyr Vale]]."
