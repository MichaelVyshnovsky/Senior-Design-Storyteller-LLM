        "mainbody": "Dreambliss was a potent and addictive sleep-inducing poison commonly found in the Free Cities of Zakhara, where it was sometimes used as a recreational drug by the wealthy.\nA small dose of dreambliss cost between 200—500 gp in the Free Cities, but the same dose could cost as much as 1,000 gp in far away Dihliz. The price of dreambliss would only increase  beyond the borders of the Land of Fate.\nThe dreambliss poison was created by carefully distilling the white sap of a particular thick-leafed plant that only grew within the shaded valleys of the Furrowed Mountains.\nVictims of dreambliss experienced the \"Sleep of Bliss\"—a deep sleep that lasted several hours. The onset of the poison was determined by the victims size, but only took several minutes at most before its effects were felt. Upon waking from the Sleep of Bliss, victims often recalled fantastic visions that they longed to re-experience.\nDreambliss could be applied to a bladed weapon in order to cause any injured target to quickly fall asleep. Its effectiveness even against larger creatures made it a popular item carried by those who dared wander the wilds of Zakhara. Dreambliss could also be taken voluntarily, albeit usually only by wealthy individuals, who wished to experience the poisons vivid dreams. Extended use of dreambliss in this manner was not without its negative side effects, causing brain damage to the user over time. The necromancer King of Ysawis, Sumulael, was one such user who abused dreambliss.\nThe hills tribes of the Furrowed Mountains consumed the raw sap as a way to induce sleep."
