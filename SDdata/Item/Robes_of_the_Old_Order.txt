The '''''robes of the Old Order''''' and '''''improved robes of the Old Order''''' were sets of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[monk]]'s robes produced by the [[Old Order]].

==Description==
Early robes were light brown with large shoulder pads, while the improved version was dark brown. Later robes reversed this color scheme, and came with white and tan mantlets, respectively, both with red belts.

==Powers==
These resilient robes could absorb some of the damage done by mundane and minor magical weapons. The improved version also provided protection like armor.

==History==
The monks of the Old Order manufactured these robes to fund their [[monasteries]]. These enabled monks of many faiths and orders to survive battles against foes in traditional armor. They were found on the [[Sword Coast North]] around [[1372 DR]].
