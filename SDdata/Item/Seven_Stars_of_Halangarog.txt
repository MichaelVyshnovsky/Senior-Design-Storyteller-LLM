The Seven Stars of Halangarog were seven powerful enchanted shuriken that belonged to Halangarog the Four-Armed, a famous Tharkul of Thar.
Each throwing star possessed a potent +4 enchantment. On top of that, they dealt additional piercing, fire, electrical, and cold damage.
The Seven Stars of Halangarog were gifted to Halangarog the Four-Armed by his seven oni mage advisors before he abdicated from the throne. The oni were impressed with the Tharkuls mastery of weapons from the lands to the east of Faer√ªn. Each of the seven oni mages imbued stars with a portion of their life force and weaved individual enchantments into the throwing stars. The oni advisers hoped to see the Seven Stars of Halangarog in battle. However, that was not to be as the Four-Armed Tharkul led the throne behind, feeling fed up with governance and ruling.
By 1372 DR, all seven enchanted shurikens were among possessions of Liam Sunmist of the Lathanderite faith in the city of Daggerford.
