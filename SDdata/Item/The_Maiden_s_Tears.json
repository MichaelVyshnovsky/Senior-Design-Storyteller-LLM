        "mainbody": "'''The Maiden's Tears''' was a set of [[diamond]]s used in a piece of jewelry in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] before being famously stolen in [[Turmish]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|23,25}}",
        "Description": "They comprised a set of fourteen matching [[diamond]]s, each one clear, polished, and cut in a teardrop shape, hence their name. These were suspended from a fine wire so they could be worn as a [[Wikipedia:pectoral|pectoral]] necklace by a woman (particularly one of large bust).",
        "History": "The Maiden's Tears were worn by a noblewoman of [[Tethyr]] who visited [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]] for a grand feast in the 1330s [[DR]]. The evening included dancing inside a globe of conjured light and sound, where the diamonds were snatched off her chest. Her consort was a powerful mage, who immediately cast a [[spell]] that briefly immobilized every person in the hall before declaring he was magically examining their minds to identify the culprit. He had his bodyguard fire a [[Sleeping poison|sleep-poisoned]] [[hand crossbow]] at everyone who tried to run the moment they could move again. But the mage had been bluffing, and it backfired badly—fifteen men and women had run, and at least six were allergic to the [[poison]] and died convulsing.\n\nIn the aftermath, the thief, if even among them, could not be identified and the jewels could not be found, despite all the magical questioning and investigation that followed. If the thief had used [[magic]] to [[teleport]] or otherwise spirit away the Maiden's Tears, this was supposed to have disturbed the dancing globe and been indicated on it, but no sign was found. Therefore, it was concluded the diamonds must still be inside the hall. The mage ordered an extensive search, turning up storage caches beneath the flagstones and secret compartments behind movable carvings on the ornate pillars, but no Maiden's Tears.\n\nIn later years, the hall was fully renovated and rebuilt, yet still the Maiden's Tears were not found. They remained a famous lost treasure tale of Alaghôn by around [[1360 DR]]."
