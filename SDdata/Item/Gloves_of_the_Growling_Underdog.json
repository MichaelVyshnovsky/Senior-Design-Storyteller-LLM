        "Powers": "When in battle, facing unfavorable odds, the gauntlets' ''underdog's bravery'' magic gave the wearer an advantage in landing successful attacks but only when they were surrounded by two or more opponents. Additionally, the gloves increased the wearer's physical strength.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a pair of ''gloves of the Growling Underdog'' was stored in the treasure room within the ruined [[Shattered Sanctum]] in the [[Chionthar Valley]]. Presumably, the gauntlets were among treasures collected in the [[Cult of the Absolute]]'s raids on nearby communities."
