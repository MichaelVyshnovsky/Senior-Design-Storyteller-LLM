'''''Aribeth's ring''''' was a magical ring that provided its wearer with resistance to spells. It was worth around 50,000 [[gold piece]]s.

This ring was the family heirloom of [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], an [[elf|elven]] [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]], but it was lost when she was defeated in combat in [[Neverwinter]] in [[1372 DR]].
