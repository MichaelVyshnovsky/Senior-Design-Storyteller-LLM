'''''Borea's Blood''''' was a legendary shard of ice-like substance shaped to be used as a magical [[dagger]].

==Description==
''Borea's Blood'' was an enchanted dagger that was a blue dagger-shaped glistening sliver of magic ice. The dagger felt cold and spread the electric feeling up the hand when touched.

==Powers==
''Borea's Blood'' possessed innate magic that granted it the ''+2'' enchantment as well surrounded the wielder with a magical shield that improved their protection. Additionally, ''Borea's Blood'' was able to generate a powerful wave of freezing air similarly to effects of the ''[[cone of cold]]'' spell.

==History==
''Borea's Blood'' was the product of an ancient [[sorceress]] named [[Borea]] who possessed a fearsome power of freezing cold that coursed through her veins. At some point in the past, she came to the City of Song never to be seen again.

Sometime long before [[1369 DR]], and before the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] were sealed shut during the [[Weeping War]], ''Borea's Blood'' was stuck into the ''Rhonglyn'' in the Deep Halls, a magical device that functioned as the elevator across all levels of the dungeons. The dagger's magic froze the device shut and its ice spread throughout all other ''Rhonglyn Rooms'' making them inoperable.

In 1369 DR, [[Kestrel]], one of the adventurers from [[Phlan]], retrieved ''Borea's Blood'' out of the frozen device, allowing it to thaw out and become operational once more. Subsequently, Kestrel used ''Borea's Blood'' to defeat the leader of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[Myth Drannor]], [[Kya Mordrayn]]. She plunged the ice dagger into the [[sorceress]]' heart. It did not kill her, however, instead, she was pulled into the Abyss by the creatures she made a pact with in punishment for her failure.

''Borea's Blood'' was known and highly praised to sages or lore savvy merchants. A [[halfling]] [[thief]] and a trader [[Nottle]] recognized the dagger and its fabled powers, attempting to persuade Kestrel to part with the item.
