Boreas Blood was a legendary shard of ice-like substance shaped to be used as a magical dagger.
Boreas Blood was an enchanted dagger that was a blue dagger-shaped glistening sliver of magic ice. The dagger felt cold and spread the electric feeling up the hand when touched.
Boreas Blood possessed innate magic that granted it the +2 enchantment as well surrounded the wielder with a magical shield that improved their protection. Additionally, Boreas Blood was able to generate a powerful wave of freezing air similarly to effects of the cone of cold spell.
Boreas Blood was the product of an ancient sorceress named Borea who possessed a fearsome power of freezing cold that coursed through her veins. At some point in the past, she came to the City of Song never to be seen again.
Sometime long before 1369 DR, and before the Dwarven Dungeons were sealed shut during the Weeping War, Boreas Blood was stuck into the Rhonglyn in the Deep Halls, a magical device that functioned as the elevator across all levels of the dungeons. The daggers magic froze the device shut and its ice spread throughout all other Rhonglyn Rooms making them inoperable.
In 1369 DR, Kestrel, one of the adventurers from Phlan, retrieved Boreas Blood out of the frozen device, allowing it to thaw out and become operational once more. Subsequently, Kestrel used Boreas Blood to defeat the leader of the Cult of the Dragon in Myth Drannor, Kya Mordrayn. She plunged the ice dagger into the sorceress heart. It did not kill her, however, instead, she was pulled into the Abyss by the creatures she made a pact with in punishment for her failure.
Boreas Blood was known and highly praised to sages or lore savvy merchants. A halfling thief and a trader Nottle recognized the dagger and its fabled powers, attempting to persuade Kestrel to part with the item.
