Horns of Fog were enchanted musical instruments that could create fog.
Horns of fog were musical trumpet-like horns carved out of horns of beasts with a silver mouthpiece.
Horns of fog produced a deep sound, typical to other horns, the main difference was that the last note produced by a horn of fog dropped subtly into a lower register.
These enchanted horns produced a thick cloud of fog when blown, similarly to the effects of fog cloud spell. A horn of fog needed to be blown for at least six seconds for it to produce a  cube of fog. The created cloud lasted from 12 seconds to 3 minutes after the instruments use. Each horn of fog couldnt produce multiple clouds, if it was played multiple times with at least six seconds of break between uses the new cloud was formed and the old one drifted away. The magical cloud slowly moved from the horn forward until it reached an obstacle, like a wall. It could be dispersed when exposed to wind.
Bards were known to be able to harness the horns of fog magic to summon a magical rain on the area of the same size as the horns fog effect.
A horns of fog could be created by a skilled crafter of wondrous items with a use of obscuring mist spell.
