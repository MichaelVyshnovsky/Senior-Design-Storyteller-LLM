'''''Oil of slipperiness''''', also known as '''''salve of slipperiness''''', was a [[magic item|magical]] unguent that rendered a creature extremely difficult to restrain.

==Description==
The oil was heavy, black, and sticky, but flowed surprisingly quickly out of its container.

One dose of ''oil of slipperiness'' was sufficient to cover the entire body and equipment of a [[human]]-sized creature. More doses were required if intended to be applied over a larger individual. Applying the oil was a process that took 10 minutes.

==Powers==
One application of the oil granted a creature the effects of a ''[[freedom of movement]]'' [[spell]] for 8 hours. Alternatively, pouring the oil on the ground covered an area equivalent to a square {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} on a side, giving it the effects of a ''[[grease]]'' spell for 8 hours.

An anointed creature or area could be cleaned of ''oil of slipperiness'' by wiping or rinsing with alcohol or [[wine]].

==Components==
The primary ingredients of ''oil of slipperiness'' were either the gland from a [[purple worm]] or the liver from a giant pike.

==Notable Owners==
===Individuals===
* [[Ozamata Ku Murawa]]
===Religions===
* [[Goldeye]]s, the [[specialty priest]]s of [[Waukeen]], had a chance of receiving some ''oil of slipperiness'' as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy.
