Oil of slipperiness, also known as salve of slipperiness, was a magical unguent that rendered a creature extremely difficult to restrain.
The oil was heavy, black, and sticky, but flowed surprisingly quickly out of its container.
One dose of oil of slipperiness was sufficient to cover the entire body and equipment of a human-sized creature. More doses were required if intended to be applied over a larger individual. Applying the oil was a process that took 10 minutes.
One application of the oil granted a creature the effects of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours. Alternatively, pouring the oil on the ground covered an area equivalent to a square  on a side, giving it the effects of a grease spell for 8 hours.
An anointed creature or area could be cleaned of oil of slipperiness by wiping or rinsing with alcohol or wine.
The primary ingredients of oil of slipperiness were either the gland from a purple worm or the liver from a giant pike.
* Ozamata Ku Murawa
* Goldeyes, the specialty priests of Waukeen, had a chance of receiving some oil of slipperiness as one of the magic items they were given upon their admission to the clergy.
