Melfs first staff was an enchanted staff that once was wielded by mage Melf of Oerth sometime before the late 15 century DR.
The weapon was a light an flexible weapon carved with mithral sigils of elven crafting.
Melfs first staff possessed a simple +1 enchantment that strengthened the weapons blows and aided the wielders aim. It also strengthened the wielders offensive magics and made their effects harder to dodge or shake off. Additionally, the wielder could cast Melfs acid arrow once per day.
The staff was presumed to come from the world of Oerth and wielded by Melf during his time leading the order of the Knights of Luna. Some speculated that not just despite his amusing name but because of it, Melf was a talented wizard and an innovator. By some unknown means, Melfs first staff ended up on Toril sometime in or before the , where it fell into the hands of Blurg, an orog member of the Society of Brilliance during his studies at a friendly myconid colony near the Ebonlake Grotto in the Western Heartlands Underdark.
