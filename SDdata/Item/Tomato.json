        "mainbody": "'''Tomato''' was a delicate red fruit from [[Maztica]]. Dried tomatoes packed in oil were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.",
        "Description": "Tomatoes could be consumed fresh picked, but they could not survive the trip to [[Faerûn]] in that state. Imported tomatoes had to be dried and preserved in oil, which intensified their sweet flavor. Tomatoes were frequently used in soups, salads, and candies.",
        "Availability": "Beyond their native land of Maztica, places in the Realms where tomatoes were known to be cultivated included:\n* [[North Faerûn]]: In [[the Dalelands]], these vegetables were cultivated by farmers in the [[Battledale]] and [[Mistledale]] regions.\n* In [[south Faerûn]], they were cultivated in the [[Arnaden region]] near areas with water.\n* In the city of [[Arrabar]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]], tomato sauce was used to fill spicy local delicacy – [[thaek bun]]s."
