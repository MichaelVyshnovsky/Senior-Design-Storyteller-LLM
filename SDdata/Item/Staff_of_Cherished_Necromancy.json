It possessed a +2 enchantment that made the weapons swings more deadly and guided it toward the targets. Additionally, each strike landed with the Staff of Cherished Necromancy dealt additional necrotic damage. The wielder also had their necromancy magic heightened, greatly increasing their chances of the necromantic spells affecting the targets. All creatures that were slain with the wielders necromancy spells had their life essence harvested and stored within the staff, allowing the wielder to cast additional necromancy spells from any circle of magic without erasing them from the casters memory.\nSometime before the , the Staff of Cherished Necromancy belonged to Cherish Hollow. But by some undisclosed means, the staff ended up in the hands of a powerful mummy lord of Baldurs Gate known as the Mystic Carrion. The staff and its undead master could be found in Philgraves Mansion in the Gates Lower City."
