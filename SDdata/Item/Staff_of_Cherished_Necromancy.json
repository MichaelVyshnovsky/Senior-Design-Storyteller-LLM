        "mainbody": "The '''''Staff of Cherished Necromancy''''' was a unique [[mage]]'s [[staff]] that once belonged to [[Cherish Hollow]], the [[necromancer]] author of ''[[The Amiable Art of Necromancy]]'' sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "The staff's head was always lit with sinister green flames and the entire shaft radiated a necrotic magical glow. It possessed a ''+2'' enchantment that made the weapon's swings more deadly and guided it toward the targets. Additionally, each strike landed with the ''Staff of Cherished Necromancy'' dealt additional necrotic damage. The wielder also had their necromancy magic heightened, greatly increasing their chances of the necromantic spells affecting the targets. All creatures that were slain with the wielder's necromancy spells had their life essence harvested and stored within the staff, allowing the wielder to cast additional necromancy spells from any circle of magic without erasing them from the caster's memory.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Staff of Cherished Necromancy'' belonged to Cherish Hollow. But by some undisclosed means, the staff ended up in the hands of a powerful [[mummy lord]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] known as the [[Mystic Carrion]]. The staff and its [[undead]] master could be found in [[Philgrave's Mansion]] in the Gate's [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]."
