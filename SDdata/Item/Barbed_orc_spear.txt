Barbed orc spears were polearms created by orcish smiths.
Barbed orc spears were crude weapons. They had sturdy wooden hafts, topped with a cruel barbed spear head. When willed in battle, these barbed weapons dealt additional piercing damage to their targets.
In the , barbed orc spears were among many smuggled orcish-foged weapons provided to the looming army of Gorgomorz - Daggerfords Devil through his alliance with the Zhentarim.
