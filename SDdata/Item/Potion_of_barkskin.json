When swirled inside its vial, it turned into tough bark like twig and back into liquid.\nConsuming a bottle of a potion of barkskin was similar in effect to the spell of the same name - barkskin, cast at a highly proficient level.\nSalts of tree bark were extracted from wood woad bark. These salts were combined with a special type of alchemical suspension to brew elixirs of barkskin."
