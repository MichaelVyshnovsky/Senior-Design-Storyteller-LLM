'''Mulhorandi dark''' was a high-quality expensive dark [[ale]] exported from [[Mulhorand]] and imported as far as [[Arrabar]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Mulhorandi dark was served in [[Efusio's Cafe]] located in the rich area of Arrabar. The establishment was notable for its expensive imported ales, [[kaeth]], and [[pipeweed]] with ''[[balaumo]]''.
