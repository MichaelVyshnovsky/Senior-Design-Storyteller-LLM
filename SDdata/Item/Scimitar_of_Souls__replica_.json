        "mainbody": "The Scimitar of Souls was a replica of Iyachtu Xvims Scimitar of Souls.\nCirca 1310 DR, Madae of the Legion of the Chimera ordered one of her most talented weapon-smiths to craft the weapon at the Severed Hand in the Spine of the World. Once it was finished, she had it placed in the hands of a statue of Iyachtu Xvim, both to honor the Godson and to arm his avatar should he one day appear. This happened when adventurers came to defeat them.\nIt was a scimitar with a polished, black blade. The blade was large and serrated all down its back, around its tip, and one quarter of the way down its edge. Although finely forged, it had a fittingly brutal appearance. It weighed .\nIt was a +3 scimitar that could suck the life from those it struck, severely weakening them. It could also be used to dispel magic."
