A '''Silver Stake gas bomb''' was a unique invention used by the [[Silver Stake]] to subdue and capture [[lycanthropes]].

==History==
It was invented by the alchemist [[Dram Kallen]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
The bombs looked like small, tightly sealed leather or cloth pouches that faintly radiated [[abjuration]] magic.

==Effects==
The bombs were pressurized with a substance to which lycanthropes were allergic. These substances varied with the type of lycanthrope, but always contained a base substance, such as [[silver]] or [[copper]]. The active ingredients ranged from [[wolfsbane]] for [[werewolves]] to [[fennel]] for [[werejackal]]s. When the bomb was thrown against a hard surface, it exploded and scattered the contents over a radius of around {{SI|15|ft}}.

They could cause a severe reaction of coughing and sneezing in a lycanthrope for around a minute, after which the effects begin to subside, but usually remained for the next 24 hours.
