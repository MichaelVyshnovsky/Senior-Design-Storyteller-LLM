A yarting was a stringed instrument, similar to a guitar, common to Amn and Calimshan.
Yartings were widespread among bards across Faer√ªn, and many variations of the instrument existed.
Various sizes of yartings were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
* Coastal Waters, a member of the bardic group Adagio Jones and The Goodwinds, had a yarting that was played for many of their songs.
* The bard Farlorn Half-Elven, an adventuring companion and once-lover of Zaranda Star, owned a yarting, which he carried slung over his back.
* Oghmas avatar carried an enchanted yarting, typically made from snowwood.
* Pacys.
