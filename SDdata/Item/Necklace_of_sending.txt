'''''Necklaces of sending''''', also referred to as '''''pendant of sending''''', were [[enchanted]] pieces of beautiful jewelry that acted as a limited power version of ''[[sending stones]]''.

==Description==
Some of the ''necklaces of sending'' created in [[Sembia]] were pendants made out of large teardrop-shaped gray [[opal]]s with beautiful swirls of pale lavender, orange, and green. The stones were hanging off of delicate [[gold]]en chains.

==Powers==
The owner of the pendant could concentrate on a person while holding the opal to send them a message as if via the ''[[sending]]'' [[spell]]. This ability could be used only once per day and messages had to be relatively short. The target of such magical messages could talk back to the sender.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Emriana Matrell]], the younger sister of [[Vambran Matrell]] of the noble [[House Matrell]] of [[Arrabar]] received a Sembian ''necklace of sending'' from her brother as a gift for her 16{{th}} birthday in [[1373 DR]].
