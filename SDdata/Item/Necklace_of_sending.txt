Necklaces of sending, also referred to as pendant of sending, were enchanted pieces of beautiful jewelry that acted as a limited power version of sending stones.
Some of the necklaces of sending created in Sembia were pendants made out of large teardrop-shaped gray opals with beautiful swirls of pale lavender, orange, and green. The stones were hanging off of delicate golden chains.
The owner of the pendant could concentrate on a person while holding the opal to send them a message as if via the sending spell. This ability could be used only once per day and messages had to be relatively short. The target of such magical messages could talk back to the sender.
