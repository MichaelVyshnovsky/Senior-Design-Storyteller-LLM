        "mainbody": "The Duskblade was an enchanted halberd once belonged to a deceased adventurer Patrick at the moment of his death in the late 14 century DR.\nThe weapon was quote mundane in its appearance, with the metal of the halberd becoming tinted with umbral colors of the night.\nThe Duskblade absorbed the dark energies of the night and the deathly cold of darkness that made it a deadly weapon enchanted to freeze its targets upon successful attacks.\nDuskblade once was an ordinary halberd that became an enchanted weapon after being left by a powerful lichs soul phylactery for several hundreds of years. Some years before the , the lich was destroyed, likely by others of his kin. In 1369 DR, a ranger companion of Mazzy Fentan named Patrick wielded the Duskblade against the Shade Lord and his pet dragon Thaxllssillyia, who infested an ancient ruined temple dedicated to Amaunator with darkness. Patrick perished in the struggle, and his undead form, now a shade, wielded the Duskblade against anyone who dared to enter the temple."
