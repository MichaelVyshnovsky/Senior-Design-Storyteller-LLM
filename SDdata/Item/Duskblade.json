        "Description": "The weapon was quote mundane in its appearance, with the metal of the halberd becoming tinted with umbral colors of the night.",
        "Powers": "The ''Duskblade'' absorbed the dark energies of the night and the deathly cold of darkness that made it a deadly weapon enchanted to freeze its targets upon successful attacks.",
        "History": "''Duskblade'' once was an ordinary halberd that became an enchanted weapon after being left by a powerful [[lich]]'s soul ''[[phylactery]]'' for several hundreds of years. Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the lich was destroyed, likely by others of his kin. In 1369 DR, a [[ranger]] companion of [[Mazzy Fentan]] named Patrick wielded the ''Duskblade'' against the [[Shade Lord]] and his pet dragon [[Thaxll'ssillyia]], who infested an ancient ruined temple dedicated to [[Amaunator]] with darkness. Patrick perished in the struggle, and his undead form, now a [[shade]], wielded the ''Duskblade'' against anyone who dared to enter the temple."
