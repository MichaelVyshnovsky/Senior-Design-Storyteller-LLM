'''Black's Finest''' was a variety of [[wine]] produced in [[Tantras]] by the [[Black Family of Merchants]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Black's Finest was brought to the year-end celebration festival in the town of [[Mossbridges]] in [[the Vast]] by [[Carl Morthinson]], a representative of the Black Family of Merchants. Carl trusted in the wine-tasting and grading competition's in which Black's Finest was enrolled to be fair. The wine produced by this noble Tantran family was sold at five [[silver]]s per tankard, and only judges were allowed free tasting.
