The cloak absorbed heat and cold from natural or magical sources such as the sun and imparted them to the wearer. Thus the wearer was also protected from any heat or cold-based spells or other magical attacks that caused harm by raising or lowering the temperature. Impact spells such as fireball and ice storm would still harm the wearer but not to their full extent.\nSince it retained heat, a cloak of comfort would be clearly outlined by a creature viewing it with infravision. When wearing a cloak of comfort, it was impossible for the wearer to suffer the ill-effects from hypothermia."
