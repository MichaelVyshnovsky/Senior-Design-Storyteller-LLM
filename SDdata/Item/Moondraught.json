        "mainbody": "moondraught, formerly known as a potion of moon-healing, was a potent healing potion used by the church of Selûne.\nHealing a living being of their injuries, this potion could be drunk in four separate doses, each equivalent to a potion of cure light wounds, or all in one shot, giving the full effect of all four. It had an even greater effect on natural or infected lycanthropes after the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, a  potion of moon-healing was twice as effective, while after the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, a moondraught was only maximally effective.\nThese potions were most often created by an appearance of moonfire at a Selûnite ritual, when the goddess Selûne was pleased and only as she willed. These items were intended for use by the clergy.\nIt was valued at 1,500 gold pieces."
