'''Rings of arbitration''' were a pair of [[magic item|magical]] [[ring]]s crafted for lovers who were bound body and soul.

==Powers==
They were both a blessing and a curse because, through the power of the rings, a burden such as a drain of life-force was shared between the wearers.

==Description==
They were [[gold]] bands with a clear [[gem|gemstone]] set in each. This gem reflected the condition of its wearer, turning to black when that person's energy or life-force was near its end.

==History==
The rings were created by [[magic]] long lost to the world by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] and only a few pairs still existed.
