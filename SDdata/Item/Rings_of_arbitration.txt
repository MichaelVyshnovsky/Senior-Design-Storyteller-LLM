Rings of arbitration were a pair of magical rings crafted for lovers who were bound body and soul.
They were both a blessing and a curse because, through the power of the rings, a burden such as a drain of life-force was shared between the wearers.
They were gold bands with a clear gemstone set in each. This gem reflected the condition of its wearer, turning to black when that persons energy or life-force was near its end.
The rings were created by magic long lost to the world by the midâ€“14 century DR and only a few pairs still existed.
