        "mainbody": "'''''Umber hulk plate''''' was a type of [[heavy armor]] crafted using [[umber hulk]] chitin and imbued with the creature's natural magic.",
        "Powers": "These plate mails were created through reasonably easy shaping and tampering of umber hulk's shell to a [[humanoid]] form. [[Duergar]] smiths learned the process of curing and reinforcing these dark sets of plates. ''Umber hulk plates'' possessed a ''+2'' enchantment but were somewhat vulnerable to slashing weapons.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''umber hulk plates'' were crafted by a [[svirfneblin]] named [[Dirty Llew]] who inhabited a deep gnome camp in the depths of the Lower [[Dorn's Deep]] in the [[Spine of the World]]."
