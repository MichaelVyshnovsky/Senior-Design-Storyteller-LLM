The sword of stonecutting was a magical sword.
This powerful sword was crafted from starmetal by Allis Lhyssich and his mage contacts of Neverwinter.
The sword of stonecutting had a +3 enchantment. It did extra damage to evil creatures, and inflicted double to those made of stone.
In 1358 DR, the owner of Allis Lhyssichs Hand Crafted Weapons and Magical Weapons for Noble Causes crafted this potent weapon for the Heroes of Ascore after they recovered a meteorite from Tuern.
