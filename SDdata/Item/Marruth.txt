'''Marruth''', also called '''root pie''' by [[Human|humans]] and [[dwarves]] or '''elvish marruth''', was a type of trail food [[pastry]] favored by the [[Fair Folk]].

==Description==
Elvish marruth was prepared with spiced mashed vegetables. Well-mixed mash was wrapped in fatty and flaky pastry dough, then baked glazed with a light [[egg]] wash. Once thoroughly cooked, marruth was chilled and wrapped in thick and oily waterproof [[rallow]] plant leaves. The wrapping prolonged the food's life and hindered rotting, making it perfect for the road.

In some taverns, marruth was served warm as a snack-sized appetizer or even as a complete dish alongside a glass of cold [[elverquisst]].

==Availability==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], marruth was commonly consumed by travelers on the [[High Road]] of the [[Sword Coast North]] and in the city of [[Luskan]].
