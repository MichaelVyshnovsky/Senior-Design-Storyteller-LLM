        "Description": "Amphoras had narrow necks and two handles. They were often made of clay.",
        "History": "The existence of amphoras on [[Toril]] dated as far back as the ancient kingdoms of the [[Raurin]]{{Cite dungeon/40/Khamsa's Folly|34}} and the [[Netherese Empire]]. The Raurin ruler [[Khamsa]] kept one within the treasury of his [[Temple of Khamsa|temple]], [[sealing wax|sealed by wax]] and housing over five hundred [[gemstone]]s of varied sizes.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, a group of adventurers known as the [[Heroes of Phlan]] ventured through a ''[[pool of darkness]]'' situated above the [[Elven Court]] and came out upon the corpse of [[Moander]] in the [[Astral Plane]]. While traveling through Moander's hair the Heroes of Phlan rescued a female [[cleric]] from the [[Cult of Moander]], who were planning to sacrifice her as an offering to their deity. Grateful for her rescue, the priestess informed the Heroes of Phlan that while running from the cultists she had dropped an amphora containing a substance that would slow the dead god's heartbeat if thrown down his mouth.\n\nAround [[1372 DR]] the sale of ''[[osssra]]'' was banned by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] following the discovery that they had been used to murder three members of [[Thorp (family)|House Thorp]]. This caused issues of pricing to arise between [[Phalantar Orivan]] and [[Sultlue|House Sultlue]], who had long been supplied with the [[oil]] by the merchant; he sought to triple his asking price, while House Sultlue only wished to pay double and only for any future shipments. While they worked through these negotiations, Phalantar kept his stock of ''osssra'' in thirty-five small amphoras within a storeroom that had once belonged to [[Artor Morlin]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/127/Vampires of Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Crypt|72}}",
        "Usage": "On the [[Upper Planes]], some [[evil]] fishermen were known to enspell amphorae with ''[[darkness]]'' so they could capture [[asrai]] and sell them to creatures of the [[Lower Planes]], such as [[hydroloth]]s, [[marraenoloth]]s, and [[slaadi]].<ref>",
        "Notable Owners": "* Amphoras full of wine could be found in the markets of [[Memnon]].\n* [[Teneth's]], a [[festhall]] and temple of [[Sune]] in [[Cormyr]], had amphoras within it.\n* Amphoras could be found in the [[Underdark]] city of [[Ust Nastha]], used by servants in the [[Female Fighters' Society]] to fill baths.<ref>"
