        "Description": "A ''camellia of the Black Lady'' was a white flower that never lost its sweet, yet overpowering, scent or luster. It gave off the impression of some form of wrongness when the inner whorls were investigated.\n\nA ''camellia of the Black Lady'' was carried around in the hair, barring the wearer to wear magical helmets or hats.",
        "Powers": "A ''camellia of the Black Lady's'' powers were activated by pressing the flower's stem and could be done so only once. The target was assaulted by three effects, a ''[[dominate person]]'', a ''[[remorseless charm]]'', and a delayed ''[[poison]]'' effect, when he or she came closer than 20 feet (6 meters) to the flower's wearer. The first and last effect were harder for followers [[Sel√ªne]] to defend themselves against.\n\nThe ''dominate person'' effect allowed the flower's wearer to order the target around. That was when the aforementioned ''remorseless charm'' effect kicked in. That effect made away with the target's conscience. These two effects lasted  for nine days, someone ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' the ''dominate person'' effect, or the ''camellia of the Black Lady'' was destroyed, whichever came first. No matter which of these three options happened, the target fell victim to [[Shar]]'s vengefulness in the form of the aforementioned ''poison'' effect.\n\nA ''camellia of the Black Lady's'' dangerous effects were, as mentioned above, only usable once, but the flower retained its permanent luster and scent.",
        "Creation": "A ''camellia of the Black Lady'' could be created by someone who was adept at crafting [[:Category:Wondrous items|wondrous items]] and had access to the ''dominate person'', ''poison'', and ''remorseless charm'' [[spell]]s.",
        "History": "The Black Lady whose name was part of the ''camellia of the Black Lady'' was a [[church of Shar|Sharran]] killer for hire who was very subtle in her jobs. It was not clear when exactly she was active."
