The '''''power gauntlets''''' were a project of [[Magister]] [[Horgyl Tusselvarr]] through the second half of the 12{{th}} century and the turn of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Most of the ''power gauntlets'' were metal armor that reached all the way to the shoulder, with retractable spurs and claws.

==Powers==
The metal gauntlets were expected to allow their user, even if not a wizard, to cast spells. The spells invested in the gauntlet were thought to include ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', ''[[magic missile]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[fly]]'', and ''[[levitate]]''. Other powers likely included some sort of hammerblow-like physical attack, and a blast of something with properties akin to full sunlight, but not thought to correspond to any known spells as of {{yearlink|1371}}.

==History==
As [[Magister]], [[Horgyl Tusselvarr]] became soon engrossed with the task of creating those gauntlets during his tenure ({{yearlink|1153}} to {{yearlink|1204}}), which he explained to [[Azuth]] would allow wizards to leave someone else the use of blasting spells in dangerous situations, as well as giving rulers a taste of what magic could do for them. Azuth, for his part, stole six pairs of his most powerful gauntlets to better spur him into the creation of ever greater magic; unable to find out who stole them, Horgyl Tusselvarr created his final and most powerful pair, which was stolen before it was finished. Though the Magister chased the thief, he never realized it was Azuth.
