        "mainbody": "The Chalice of Amaunator was a powerful and ancient Amaunatori artifact. It was considered a powerful weapon against the forces of darkness and the antithesis of anything related to the Shadow Weave.\nThe chalice was made from alabaster, wrapped with bands of gold and inlayed with fire opals, jacinths, and topazes. The sides of its bowl featured two removable seals, about the size of a gold coin, each inscribed with a sunburst that resembled Amaunators holy symbol. The chalice itself stood about two hand-widths tall.\nThe Chalice of Amaunator possessed several magical powers that could be evoked by anyone that held it. The chalice was a self-identifying object its wielder learned one of its powers each minute until all were revealed. These revelations only occurred if both of the chalices seals remained within their receptacles. Its powers included\n* Once per day, the chalice could drawn down destructive rays of sunlight from the skies above. In order to function, the bowl of the chalice had to be filled with some type of flammable solution.\n* Once per month, the chalice could transport its wielder and several others to another plane of existence. To accomplish this feat, the bowl of the chalice had to be filled with an unchanged substance found in the natural world.\n* Approximately once per month, the bowl of the chalice could fill itself with liquid sun. This substance held numerous potent properties in itself, including the ability to disjoin items, entities, or objects bound to the Shadow Weave.\nThe Chalice of Amaunator was created some time during the time of ancient Netheril, an empire that collapsed over three centuries before Dale Reckoning.\nAt some point, one of the chalices seals was separated from the rest of the artifact. It somehow wound up within the Crypt of Augathra the Mad.\nDuring or after the , a group of adventurers recovered the Chalice of Amaunator from Askilions Tower, in order to prevent Shadovar followers of Shar from uncovering until magical secrets.\nIt was said that the liquid sun produced by the Chalice of Amaunator could potentially melt down the QuessArTeranthvar, the golden tree that comprised one of the two sets of Nether Scrolls. This could only be accomplished however, if the QuessArTeranthvars creator, Tyvollus Aluviirsan, released it from his protection."
