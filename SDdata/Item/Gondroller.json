        "mainbody": "'''Gondrollers''' were a type of [[humanoid]]-powered, three-wheeled vehicle developed by the [[Church of Gond]] that required relatively smooth trails.",
        "Description": "These vehicles had soft, squashy fat tires and rear cargo beds.",
        "Availability": "Genuine gondrollers were rather rare and expensive, being only constructed and sold by temples of [[Gond]]. Those who saw them would often try to hire a smith to create them a knock-off, but even these were rare due to the difficulty of making the vehicle's necessary [[axle]]s, wheels, and tires."
