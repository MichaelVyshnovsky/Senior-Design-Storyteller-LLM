The Craftsmans hammer was an ordinary-looking hammer that somehow became enchanted with its magics going without notice until 1312 DR.
The Craftsmans hammer was designed as a tool. It was slower and heavier than similarly-sized warhammer when wielded in battle. Each swing with the craftsmans hammer was more deadly than that of an ordinary hammer. Its +1 enchantment created a clear ringing note when lightly tapped.
In or shortly before Mirtul of 1312 DR, the craftsmans hammer was used to build palisades in the the town of Targos of Icewind Dale being the period of time the Ten-Towns were menaced by the Legion of the Chimera. It was likely none of the workers detected the weapons magical properties and eventually traded it to the Gallaway Trade Depot. The hammer ended up being available for purchase from Deirdre Gallaway in her trading companys store in Targos the same year.
