The '''''Craftsman's hammer''''' was an ordinary-looking [[hammer]] that somehow became [[enchanted]] with its magics going without notice until [[1312 DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Craftsman's hammer'' was designed as a tool. It was slower and heavier than similarly-sized [[warhammer]] when wielded in battle. Each swing with the ''craftsman's hammer'' was more deadly than that of an ordinary hammer. Its ''+1'' enchantment created a clear ringing note when lightly tapped.

==History==
In or shortly before [[Mirtul]] of 1312 DR, the ''craftsman's hammer'' was used to build palisades in the the town of [[Targos]] of [[Icewind Dale]] being the period of time the [[Ten-Towns]] were menaced by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. It was likely none of the workers detected the weapon's magical properties and eventually traded it to the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]]. The hammer ended up being available for purchase from [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in her trading company's store in [[Targos]] the same year.
