        "Powers": "These rings were similar to any other magic ring found on [[Toril|Al-Toril]] save for the fact that casting ''[[detect magic]]'' did not reveal that the ring was in fact magical. Spells such as ''[[identify]]'' and ''[[legend lore]]'' worked normally when used on a ''ring of cloaked wizardry''."
