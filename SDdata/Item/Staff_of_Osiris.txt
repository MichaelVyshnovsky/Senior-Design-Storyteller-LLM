The staff of Osiris was an enchanted quarterstaff that was favored by priests of Osiris.
This staff was made from dark mahogany. Painted hieroglyphs covered its entire length.
In addition to making it much easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponent, the staff of Osiriss magic also negated one incoming melee attack per minute. This power did not function against ranged attacks or spells cast against the wielder.
Twenty of these staves were known to exist. Despite its name, these staves were used by other faiths within the Old Empires.
