The '''''staff of Osiris''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] that was favored by [[priest]]s of [[Osiris]].

==Description==
This staff was made from dark mahogany. Painted hieroglyphs covered its entire length.

==Powers==
In addition to making it much easier for the wielder to strike and harm their opponent, the ''staff of Osiris''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[magic]] also negated one incoming melee attack per minute. This power did not function against ranged attacks or [[spell]]s cast against the wielder.

==History==
Twenty of these staves were known to exist. Despite its name, these staves were used by other faiths within the [[Old Empires]].
