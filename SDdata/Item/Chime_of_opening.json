The chime sent out a clear tone that unlocked one of the locks keeping the object closed, or the object itself if it only had one lock.\nThe chime could even bypass certain magical effects such as hold portal or arcane lock spells. However, if the sound could not reach the object, such as if blocked by a silence spell or similar effect, it did not have any effect.\nThe chime could be used up to ten times, after which it shattered and lost its powers.\nCirca 1372 DR, a chime of opening could be found in one of the cluttered tables with \"antiques\" in Torleths Treasures of Gillians Hill."
