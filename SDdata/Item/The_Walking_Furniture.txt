The Walking Furniture was a mixed alcoholic drink from the city of Ravens Bluff, served at the Silvermoon Playhouse in the late 14 century DR.
The Walking Furniture drink was made by mixing alcoholic apple cider and a certain type of brown liquor. The drinks name was inspired by the fact that just a few servings could leave the imbiber so drunk, they would swear the furniture "just jumped out and attacked their legs."
