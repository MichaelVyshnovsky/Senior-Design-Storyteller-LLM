        "mainbody": "Coverlets, sometimes erroneously called bed spreads,\nThese coverings were light, delicately designed, and often lacy. Unlike true bed spreads, a coverlet was designed simply to improve the decor of a room, not to provide warmth.\n* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold coverlets at a standard price of two gold pieces in its \"Inn and Tavern\" section.\n* Arnise Hold, the familial keep of the Arnise family of Amn, had thick fur coverlets decorating the beds in its guestrooms."
