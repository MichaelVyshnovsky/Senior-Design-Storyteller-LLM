Sand of scintillation was a useful magical sand from Zakhara that was beneficial to those who found themselves in a tight situation.
When thrown into the air, this sand caused a blinding explosion of hypnotic light. Most creatures who saw the explosion were stunned for several minutes. The explosion affected all of those within 50 feet (15 m) in every direction. Each additional handful of sand of scintillation used increased the effect and range by another 50 feet.
