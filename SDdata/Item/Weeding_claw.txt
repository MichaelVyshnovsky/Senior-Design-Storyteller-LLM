A weeding claw was a handy tool for digging and scraping at plants and soil.
As the name indicated, a weeding claw was a small metal claw held in the hand used for weeding in gardens. If absolutely necessary, it could be wielded as a crude gouging weapon.
Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold claws for 7 sp, and a special attachable pole for 6 sp that allowed it to emulate a rake.
