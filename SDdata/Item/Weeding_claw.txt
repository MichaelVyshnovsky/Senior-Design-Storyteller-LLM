A '''weeding claw''' was a handy tool for digging and scraping at plants and soil.

==Description==
As the name indicated, a weeding claw was a small metal claw held in the hand used for weeding in gardens. If absolutely necessary, it could be wielded as a crude gouging weapon.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold claws for 7 [[sp]], and a special attachable [[pole]] for 6 sp that allowed it to emulate a [[rake]].
