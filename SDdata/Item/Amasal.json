Amasals wielder was able to choose any of the following spell-like powers to use lightning bolt, anti-magic shell, death spell, spell turning, and incendiary cloud. They could use these powers up to three times per day. These spell-like powers were used as if cast by an exceptionally skilled wizard.\nAmasals powers only functioned when within a mile of its twin blade Thael.\nThe sword was carried into battle by Gaeleath and his twin brother against a horde of gnolls to defend Illefarn. The brothers perished during the battle, but Amasal was later recovered and brought to Taltempla."
