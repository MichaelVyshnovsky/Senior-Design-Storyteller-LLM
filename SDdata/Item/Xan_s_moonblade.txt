'''Xan's ''moonblade''''' was the powerful ''[[moonblade]]'' that belonged to the [[Evereska]]n [[enchanter]] [[Xan]].

==Description==
When unsheathed, the blade was engulfed in blue flames, similar to a [[magic]]al ''[[flame tongue]]''  sword.

==Powers==
The sword possessed a ''+3 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''<ref group="note">The original version of [[Baldur's Gate (game)|''Baldur's Gate'']] gave this item a +1 enchantment, but it was increased to a +3 in the [[Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition|enhanced edition]]. and offered Xan protection from both physical attacks and flames both magical and mundane.

==History==
The sword was created by the skilled artisans of [[Myth Drannor]]. Like other blades of its kind, this ''moonblade'' chose its wielder, selecting Xan above any others.

Xan was separated from his sword when he was captured by [[Mulahey]], and imprisoned in the mines near [[Nashkel]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==Notable Owners==
Xan was the only individual who was capable of wielding his namesake blade.
