A bucket was a common and practical kind of container found in the Realms, where it was used to carry liquids such as water, as well as other materials.
Wooden buckets had constructions similar to barrels, being made of wooden staves bound by hoops. Variants could be made of leather and sturdy metals. A smaller bucket could hold about 3 gallons of liquid, or half a cubic foot of material, while larger variants held 5 or 10 gallons each.
