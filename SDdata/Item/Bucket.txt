A bucket was a common and practical kind of container found in the Realms, where it was used to carry liquids such as water, as well as other materials.
Wooden buckets had constructions similar to barrels, being made of wooden staves bound by hoops. Variants could be made of leather and sturdy metals. A smaller bucket could hold about 3 gallons of liquid, or half a cubic foot of material, while larger variants held 5 or 10 gallons each.

Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a range of buckets in 5 and 10 gallon sizes, made of leather, wood, bronze, iron, and steel.
* Buckets were extremely useful for carrying water, and also served as excellent receptacles for other materials as needed.
* Some kept buckets of water near their jake, sometimes scented so as to stave away stagnant odor, to flush their waste down.
The Black Bucket Hunt in Waterdeep used the Black Bucket as its centerpiece.
