The '''''Bow of Eletha''''' was an enchanted [[bow]] once carried by the [[elf]] warrior [[Eletha]].

==Powers==
This bow doubled the normal range of any [[arrow]] it shot. It also caused any arrow to inflict more physical harm upon targets. The bow's final power was that it could convert a normal arrow into a blast of energy similar to the ''[[magic missile]]'' spell as if it were cast by a skilled [[wizard]]. This power could be used up to three times per day.
