        "mainbody": "A candle of truth was a common magical item that created a zone of truth around it when lit.\nCandles of truth were white, half-pound (quarter-kilogram) candles made of tallow and enchanted with a zone of truth spell. They could burn for one hour and typically sold for 2,500 gold pieces.\nA candle of truth gave of a faint enchantment aura.\nWhen lit, the magic candle strongly compelled anyone within a five-foot (1.5-meter) radius to tell only the truth. The candle could only be used one time if it was snuffed out, relighting it would not re-initiate the magic effect.\nAnyone trained in the art of crafting wondrous magical items who also knew the spell zone of truth could create this type of item.\nThe infamous adventurer Horlo Aumrabbar was in possession of a candle of truth."
