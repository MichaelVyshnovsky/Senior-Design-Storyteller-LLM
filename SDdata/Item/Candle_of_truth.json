        "Description": "''Candles of truth'' were white, half-pound (quarter-kilogram) candles made of tallow and enchanted with a ''zone of truth'' spell. They could burn for one hour and typically sold for 2,500 [[gp|gold pieces]].\n\nA ''candle of truth'' gave of a faint [[enchantment]] aura.",
        "Powers": "When lit, the magic candle strongly compelled anyone within a five-foot (1.5-meter) radius to tell only the truth. The candle could only be used one time; if it was snuffed out, relighting it would not re-initiate the magic effect.",
        "Creation": "Anyone trained in the art of crafting wondrous magical items who also knew the spell ''zone of truth'' could create this type of item.",
        "Notable Owners": "The infamous adventurer [[Horlo Aumrabbar]] was in possession of a ''candle of truth''."
