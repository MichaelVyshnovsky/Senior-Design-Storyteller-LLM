        "mainbody": "The First Imaskarcana was an artifact said to be amongst the most powerful ever created by the artificers of Imaskar. It was one of the Seven Imaskarcana. \nThe First Imaskarcana was a large, crudely wrought crown of lavender-tinted metal set with a single star sapphire. Despite being created to be worn by humans, the First Imaskarcana could fit any humanoid of similar size to humans quite comfortably.\nThe First Imaskarcana held the collected knowledge of the empires Lord Artificers. However, it would never engage in conversation, instead responding only to direct questions and always with brief answers.\nIt provided the wearer with strong spell resistance and, if commanded to, it would cast spells on behalf of its wearer. It had spells related to interplanar travel, piercing illusions, and antimagic. One of its spell powers, legend lore, would only work upon Imaskari items. However, all commands had to be spoken in Roushoum if addressed in a different language, the artifact would cast a feeblemind spell upon its wearer.\nThe First Imaskarcana was thought to have been created over nine thousand years before the 14 century DR, but other sources dated creation of all seven to , under the orders of Lord Artificer Omanond of Inupras. It was worn by Lord Artificer Yuvaraj when he was slain by the avatar of Horus in Inupras in . The artifact was said to still lie deep beneath the sands of the ruins of Inupras, not far from the palace, in the 14 century DR.\nMysteriously, the First Imaskarcana was claimed by the One of Many, a being of pure malice and evil, born in the shadow Mulsantir. The One of Many was in possession of the crown when it resurfaced in the deep jungles of the Samarlogh, deep jungles in the hidden nation of Samarach in the . \n*Lord Artificer Yuvaraj"
