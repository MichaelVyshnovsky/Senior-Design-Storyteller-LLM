Portrait of Fane was a painting depicting a spellcasting undead creature, created many years before the late 15 century DR.
This portrait was an exquisite work of art. Its subject was a skeletal creature in a red cloak, enveloped in green swirling spell energy. The undead was so life-like it almost felt like its empty eye sockets followed those who looked at the painting, judgmentally.
In the , the Portrait of Fane was found within the ancient and abandoned Temple of Jergal in the Western Heartlands, after the structure was broken into by Gimblebock and his scavenger crew.
