        "mainbody": "Dragon slippers were several pairs of enchanted boots created by a noteworthy dragon hunter Feryl.\nThese boots were enchanted specifically for slaying dragons. They granted the wearer complete immunity to fear and magically affixed themselves to the ground, preventing the wearer from being knocked prone. Additionally, they increased the wearers dexterity and protected them from spells.\nFeryl Dragonhunter was a man who succeeded in slaying of four dragons in his lifetime. He created several pairs of humorously named dragon slippers, enchanted boots, to aid with the hunt. Ironically enough, Feryl was not killed by a dragon but by a pack of goblins on his way to hunt the wyrms. By the late 14 century DR several pairs of dragon slippers could be found across the Sword Coast and the Moonsea region.\n*Olgin Hasterean, an uncannily intelligent ogre mage who dwelt within Undermountain circa 1372 DR."
