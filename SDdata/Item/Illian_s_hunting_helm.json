        "mainbody": "Illians hunting helm was an enchanted horned hin helmet created for a hunter named Illian Willowdusk.\nThe helmet was enhanced with a +2 enchantment.\nIllians hunting helm was created sometime before the  as a reward for the famed elven hunter Illian Willowdusk. This ill-fated item was a gift from a group of halflings who were saved by the hunter from an evil Malarite priest and his trained bloodthirsty beast. Since Illian left the hin shire, the enchanted helm served him well until he embarked on a great hunt, chasing a large stag during the elven holiday of CinnaelosCor. As the stag rushed through a thick patch of briars, the hunter rushed after it. Illians hunting helm got caught on the vegetation, and with a loud snap, the hunters neck was broken. His body was discovered the following day, still stuck in the shrubbery.\nBy 1281 DR, Illians hunting helm had fallen into the hands of the drow trader Nym in the underground stronghold of Dorns Deep in the mountains of the Spine of the World."
