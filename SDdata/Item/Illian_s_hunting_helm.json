        "Powers": "The helmet was enhanced with a ''+2'' enchantment.",
        "History": "''Illian's hunting helm'' was created sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}} as a reward for the famed [[elf|elven]] hunter Illian Willowdusk. This ill-fated item was a gift from a group of [[halfling]]s who were saved by the hunter from an evil [[Malarite]] [[priest]] and his trained bloodthirsty beast. Since Illian left the hin shire, the enchanted helm served him well until he embarked on a great hunt, chasing a large [[stag]] during the [[elf|elven]] holiday of [[Cinnaelos'Cor]]. As the stag rushed through a thick patch of briars, the hunter rushed after it. ''Illian's hunting helm'' got caught on the vegetation, and with a loud snap, the hunter's neck was broken. His body was discovered the following day, still stuck in the shrubbery.\n\nBy 1281 DR, ''Illian's hunting helm'' had fallen into the hands of the [[drow]] trader [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]] in the underground stronghold of [[Dorn's Deep]] in the mountains of the [[Spine of the World]]."
