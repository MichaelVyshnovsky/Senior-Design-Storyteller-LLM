        "mainbody": "A '''pulley''' was a simple wheel-like device that aided in lifting and transporting loads and in climbing. It was called a '''''jama''''' in [[Midani dictionary|Midani]].",
        "Functions": "By providing increased leverage, a pulley could be used with [[rope]] to lift heavy loads. If the rope was strung horizontally, such as across a chasm, the pulley could be rolled to transport loads from one side to the other.\n\nThey were also of use in mountain climbing.\n\nA specific type of pulley was called a block and was typically used as part of a [[block and tackle]].\n\nPriests of [[Gond]] were required to be able to demonstrate the function of the pulley and other simple machines to demonstrate how great things could be achieved without [[magic]].<ref>",
        "Availability": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold single pulleys intended for climbing for 15 [[gp]] each and as part of rope sets for 40 gp.<ref>",
        "Usage": "[[File:Hekkut the Molted.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A pulley used to lower rocks over Hekkut's escape tunnel.'']]\n[[Chain]]s on pulleys were often used to raise and lower lamps, such as [[candle]] lamps in taverns like the [[Broken Goblet]] in [[Roaringshore]]<ref> and the [[High Helm]] in [[Juniril]],<ref> and [[oil lamp]]s used as public lighting in [[Suzail]] and other cities.<ref>\n\nRopes on pulleys were used to raise and lower [[rowboat]]s off the sides off of large sailing [[ship]]s.<ref>\n\nPulleys could be used to operate elevators,<ref> such as in some settlements based in forest canopies.<ref> They were also in serving lifts like at the [[Dusty Hoof]] in [[Scornubel]],<ref> the [[dumbwaiter]]s in [[Castle Spulzeer]] in [[Amn]],<ref> and even the [[dretch]]-powered dumbwaiters in [[Orcus]]'s castle.<ref>\n\nPulleys were used to manually raise and lower [[bucket]]s into wells, such as at [[Flaming Tower]].<ref><ref>\n\nPulleys and pivots were used to create sliding walls and other architecture, such as a coffin that moved aside to reveal a passage in the Undertomb in [[Darkhorn Castle]].<ref> Pulleys also lifted large grates over prisoner pits in the [[Fane of the Night Serpent]],<ref> and enabled zombie-powered doors at the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]].<ref> [[Steel]] pulleys and thick [[iron]] chains operated a canal lock against lava in the [[Temple of Eternal Flame]].<ref> Others controlled dropping cages in the [[Tomb of Moving Stones]].<ref> Pulleys were using in the engineering of secret doors, traps, and hidden treasure in [[Undermountain]].<ref><ref>\n\nCords on pulleys strung across the village of [[Gladehap]] in [[Cormyr]] were used to deliver goods and messages and as washing lines.<ref>\n\nThe [[monk]]s of [[Ra-Khati]] used massive wooden pulleys and thick ropes to transport cargo at their mountaintop monasteries, such as the [[Yellow Abbey]]. These same lifts were also used to power [[grainmill]]s.<ref>\n\nA complicated arrangement of pulleys, winches, and more, powered by [[zombie]]s, was used to lift whole ships in and out of [[Skullport]].<ref>\n\nA system of ropes and pulleys was used by [[Hekkut|Hekkut the Molted]] to block his escape route with a load of heavy rocks at this [[Tanglefork Woods]] hideout in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.<includeonly></includeonly>\n\nThe Gondar ''[[steam dragon]]'' at the [[Hall of Wonders]] used pulleys to transport large items.<ref><ref>",
        "Reputation": "A lot of [[human]]s mistakenly thought [[gnome]]s spent a lot of their time fiddling with pulleys, ropes, and more complex machinery as part of their madcap inventions.<ref>"
