        "mainbody": "Sending stones were magical items that allowed remote communication over any distance, even across different planes.\nSending stones always came in pairs. They were smooth and delicately carved to match each other, so the pairs were easily recognizable. If one stone from the pair were destroyed, the other would lose its magic.\nWhen activated, a sending stone could be used to cast a sending spell targeted at the bearer of its pair. If the receiving stone had no bearer at the moment of the casting, the stone did not cast the spell and made the user aware of it. This power could be used once, after which the stone regained its magic at dawn.\n* Beldora, a Harper agent stationed in Bryn Shander in the late 1480s DR, used a sending stone regularly to report to her fellow agent Thwip Ironbottom in Hundelstone.\n* Salida, a yuan-ti pureblood spy in Port Nyanzaru in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR, used a sending stone to report anyone that was searching for Omu to Ras Nsi.\n* The Flaming Fist commander Liara Portyr held a sending stone which she used to apprise the Calishite pirate Zaroum Al-Saryak about any ships leaving or entering Port Nyanzaru in the late 1480s or early 1490s DR."
