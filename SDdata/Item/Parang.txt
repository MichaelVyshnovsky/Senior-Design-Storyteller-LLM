A '''parang''' was a kind of [[machete]] from [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Parangs were machetes with heavy chopping blades and weighed around {{SI|4|lb|k|long=yes}}. They were used as both tools and weapons.

A typical parang might sell for 15 [[yuan]] in a Kara-Turan market.

==Reputation==
[[Monk]]s of Kara-Tur sometimes used parangs as weapons, and primitive people groups in Kara-Tur commonly carried the blades with them at all times.

==Notable Owners==
[[The Serpent]], the enigmatic leader of the [[Phoenix clan]] of [[ninja]], owned a parang of superb craftsmanship.

[[Kashigawa Yoichi]], a [[kensai]] from [[Kozakura]], was known to train students in the art of fighting with the parang.

[[Toipeye]], a [[korobokuru]] [[bushi]], owned a magical parang.

[[Awang Sophir]], a famous [[human]] monk, fought with a parang.
