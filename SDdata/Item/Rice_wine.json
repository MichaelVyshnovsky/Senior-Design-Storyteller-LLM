        "mainbody": "Rice wine, also known as sake in Kara-Tur, was a variety of wine made from rice that was popular throughout that continent.\nThis wine was made by mashing and fermenting rice, though some used mashed corn as a substitute. It was normally served warm in small cups,\n* The finest sake in Wa was brewed in Rukimbaru. \n* In Kozakura, some temples brewed special sake, in buildings called sakadono, that was used in ceremonies. \n* In the city of Ravens Bluff, Flirins Sea Morsels sold rice wine, made by an elderly emigrant of Kara-Tur.\nWarm sake was used as a material component for the sustain spell. Rice wine could be used in cooking, creating dishes such as duck that has been steamed in rice wine.\n* Bakemono were particularly fond of sake.\n* Tengu could often be appeased or befriended with an offering of sake.\n*  In Wa, sake was often left as an offering at spirit shrines.\nA bottle of endless sake was a magical item which produced sake whenever it was shaken."
