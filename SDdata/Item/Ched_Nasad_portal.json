        "mainbody": "The so-called Ched Nasad portal was a portal that connected the drow city of Ched Nasad with the Dalelands.\nThe Ched Nasad portal, like any other portal consisted of two gates an Underdark one in Ched Nasad and a surface one in the Dalelands, namely Deepingdale.\nThe Underdark end was found in a tunnel in the subterranean citys vicinity. In fact, the tunnel was well-traveled, and the surface end was connected with a drow community on the surface.\nThe portal was owned by a cell of the church of Vhaeraun active in Ched Nasad and in Deepingdale. The Underdark one consisted mostly of disenfranchised male drow and the surface one a larger settlement that followed the faith of Vhaeraun.\nThe portal was a close-guarded secret of the church. In fact they had their rogue and assassin members stationed in the portals vicinity to organize the deaths of people who stumbled upon it.\nThe Ched Nasad portal was effectively a smuggling route. It allowed access to a reliable source of riding lizards, fungi, and other Underdark goods for the surface drow and an easy access to necessities like food and water, It also allowed quick allocation of other resources like manpower between these groups for their respective aims of hurting Ched Nasads matriarchy and Deepingdales population.\nThe portal was always accessible on the Underdark side and only after sunset on the surface side. The portal was impossible to access for their enemies because it was keyed to a male divine caster,\nThe Underdark cell was also active in causing a shortage of the necessities like food and water to which they had easy access to. They planned to weaken Lolths matriarchy and eventually take over the city."
