'''Leather armor''' was a type of light [[armor]].

==Description==
Leather armor was made from [[leather]]. The armor pieces covering the shoulders and chest were often boiled in [[oil]] to make them stiffer. The rest of the armor was softer and more flexible.

==Notable Wearers==
===Individuals===
* The [[avatar]] of [[Abbathor]]
* The avatar of [[Marthammor Duin]]
===Organizations===
* The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]].
* The members of the [[Purple Dragon knight]]s that were garrisoned at the port city of [[Marsember]] were restricted to leather armor, a safety precaution against drowning in the case of any Purple Dragon falling in the water.
===Races & Sentient Creatures===
* [[Urd]]s valued fine leather armor and about half of all urd chiefs possessed a magical suit of leather armor.
* [[Wood elves]] favored leather armour and would often dye it in dark green hues for camouflage.<ref name ="RoF45">
