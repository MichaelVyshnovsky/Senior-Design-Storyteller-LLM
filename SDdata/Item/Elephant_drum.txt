The elephant drum was a large instrument that originated in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Elephant drums resembled darbukkahs but measured up to 6 feet in height. These large drums were mounted on either side of an elephant, hence their name. A rider would strike the drums with large mallets to produce a deep tone.
The elephant drums were most famous because of their use during parades by the Mad Caliph of Afyal.
