        "mainbody": "tar pots, also called fire pots, were ceramic incendiary devices found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThese ceramic jars were filled with liquid star and fitted with a thick wax wick. The jars were constructed to be strong enough to avoid accidents or light impacts and were typically used with siege engines, though they could be thrown by hand to great effect assuming the wielder was strong enough to ensure they shattered upon impact.\nWhen shattered a star pot would douse any nearby objects with flaming liquid star oil. The liquid star burned for several minutes following the impact.\nGiven the inherent risk in their use, star pots were usually reserved for highly trained soldiers. Star pots were illegal in the Free Cities of Zakhara, though they could still be obtained on the black market for 55â€“100 gold pieces each.\nCategoryWeapons\nCategoryRanged weapons\nCategory50-74 gold pieces\nCategory75-99 gold pieces\nCategoryItems from Zakhara\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\ncew7s4bftc5s5vuq5m307535eftvoww"
