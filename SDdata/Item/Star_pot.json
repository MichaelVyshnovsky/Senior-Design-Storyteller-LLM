        "mainbody": "'''Star pots''', also called '''fire pots''', were ceramic incendiary devices found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.",
        "Uses": "These [[ceramic]] [[jar]]s were filled with [[liquid star]] and fitted with a thick wax [[wick]]. The jars were constructed to be strong enough to avoid accidents or light impacts and were typically used with [[siege engine]]s, though they could be thrown by hand to great effect assuming the wielder was strong enough to ensure they shattered upon impact.\n\nWhen shattered a star pot would douse any nearby objects with flaming liquid star oil. The liquid star burned for several minutes following the impact.",
        "History": "Given the inherent risk in their use, star pots were usually reserved for highly trained soldiers. Star pots were illegal in the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]], though they could still be obtained on the black market for 55–100 [[gold piece]]s each.",
