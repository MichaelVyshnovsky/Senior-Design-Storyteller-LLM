A bottomless potion of swagger was a self-refilling potion that likely fell into the possession of several adventurers in the late 15 century DR.
The potion was wine-red in color. It came in a common-looking glass flask.
It allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and to heal minor wounds. Drinking the potion created the feeling of being unstoppable. Some time had to pass before the potion refilled itself.
In the late 15 century DR, these items could be found in Neverwinter, Gauntlgrym, Mount Hotenow, and Neverwinter Wood. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such potions were likely found by the adventurers that stopped Deathsleep, the green dragon.
