A '''''bottomless potion of swagger''''' was a self-refilling [[potion]] that likely fell into the possession of several [[adventurer]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The potion was [[wine]]-red in color. It came in a common-looking glass [[flask]].

==Powers==
It allowed its user to increase the damage dealt by their successful attacks and to [[heal]] minor wounds. Drinking the potion created the feeling of being unstoppable. Some time had to pass before the potion refilled itself.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], these items could be found in [[Neverwinter]], [[Gauntlgrym]], [[Mount Hotenow]], and [[Neverwinter Wood]]. They were also available for purchase at shops in those locations. Such potions were likely found by the adventurers that stopped [[Deathsleep]], the [[green dragon]].
