        "Description": "Typically made of [[brass]], a chime lamp had attached to it a vented wheel that was set in motion by the rising hot [[air]] from the flame. The wheel had blades that struck an array of [[chime]]s made of crystal or [[brass]], producing a soothing sound. The lamp's light shone with a rosy glow.",
