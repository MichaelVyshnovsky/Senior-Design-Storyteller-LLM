        "mainbody": "Chime lamps were decorative sonorous lamps from Evermeet.\nTypically made of brass, a chime lamp had attached to it a vented wheel that was set in motion by the rising hot air from the flame. The wheel had blades that struck an array of chimes made of crystal or brass, producing a soothing sound. The lamps light shone with a rosy glow.\nChime lamps imported from Evermeet were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue."
