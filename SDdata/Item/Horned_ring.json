        "mainbody": "The '''''horned rings''''' were eight [[enchanted]] [[ring]]s that the mad wizard [[Halaster]] created for himself and his seven apprentices.",
        "Description": "These [[iron]] rings had small horns rising out of them that curved backward toward the wearer's fingers.",
        "Powers": "Halaster imbued each of the eight ''horned rings'' with distinct powers and immunities, only accessible by the individual they were designed for. Anyone else who wore one of these rings had access to only one or more powers.\n\nThe most common power of the ''horned rings'' was similar to Halaster's [[Halaster's teleportation ring|''teleportation rings'']] or the ''[[greater teleport]]'' [[spell]], but teleported the wearer to different locations within [[Undermountain]]. The wearer was also able to specify where they wished to teleport. Following the [[Spellplague]], this was the only power of the rings available to laypeople.\n\nThe ring could break through any magical barriers, with the exception of ''[[prismatic wall]]s'' or ''[[prismatic sphere]]s'', to get them there safely, allowing it to bypass ''[[Halaster's teleport cage]]''. And the wearer could cloak themselves upon command in an ''[[antimagic aura]]''.\n\nIn order to recharge itself, a ''horned ring'' would absorb any incoming ''[[magic missile]]s'' and magical and natural electrical energy directed at the wearer. The wearer was completely protected from attacks of these kinds while wearing a ''horned ring''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Garrik Oakspear]], Halaster's chief spy during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], had a ''horned ring'' in his possession.\n* Halaster Blackcloak, the creator of the ''horned rings''.<ref>\n* A [[helmed horror]], hidden away in a secret room on the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain, had a ''horned ring'' on its right gauntlet in [[1358 DR]]. When a group of [[adventurer]]s eventually came across the helmed horror, it extended its gauntlet out and offered them the ring.<ref>\n* [[Iyrauroth]], a powerful [[black dragon]] from [[Thar]], had one of the ''horned rings'' in his possession in [[1373 DR]].\n* [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]], one of the seven former apprentices of Halaster, had a ''horned ring'' in her possession prior to her disappearance. but in actuality it was still in her possession.\n* [[Maddgoth]] had a ''horned ring'' in his possession in the 15{{th}} century DR.<ref>\n* [[Muiral]], one of the seven apprentices of Halaster, had a ''horned ring'' in his possession.<ref>",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors abounded that the ''horned rings'' allowed Halaster to remotely view their wearer and read their thoughts."
