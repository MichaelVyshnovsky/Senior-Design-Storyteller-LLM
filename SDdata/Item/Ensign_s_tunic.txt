Ensigns tunics were sets of enchanted light armor worn by buccaneers from the Nelanther Isles off the coast of the Sword Coast.
These items were enchanted with +1 enchantments at a cost of reduced reflex speed.
Traditionally, ensigns were the lowers ranking commissioned officers in land military forces. However, as of the late-14 century DR, ensigns tunics were given out to the pirates who were the first to act on buccaneer vessels of the Sea of Swords. These "red shirts" were first to be sent off docked vessels into the unknown, first to be tasked with opening potentially deadly-trapped treasure chests.
