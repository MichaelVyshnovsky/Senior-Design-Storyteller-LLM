The star's know was engraved with the word \"thunder\" in [[Gnomish]], [[Sylvan]], [[Elvish]], [[Celestial language|Celestial]], [[Primordial language|Primordial]] and many other languages that all merged into the powerful ''thunderword.'' Each smash with the weapon dealt additional thunder damage to the targets and once per day, the wielder could channel the ''thunderword'' into a powerful strike of thunderous smite.",
