'''Hambergyle''', also known as '''hambergite''', was a somewhat rare [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]].

==Description==
Hambergyle was found in crystal or fragmentary form. It was colorless and fairly hard, yielding small, [[wikipedia:facet|faceted]] gems. A typical specimen had a base value of 50 gp.

==Powers==
If a hambergyle gem was held in a flame and ''[[light]]'' was cast upon it, the gem was consumed but produced a ''[[continual light]]'' at that spot.
