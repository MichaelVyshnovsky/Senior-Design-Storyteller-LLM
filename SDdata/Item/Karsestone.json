        "mainbody": "The '''''Karsestone''''' was the petrified heart of the Momentary God [[Karsus]], a powerful [[artifact]] that remained the only source of [[whole magic]] in the Realms following [[Karsus's Folly]]. For millennia it was embedded within the [[Karsus Butte]],\n\n{{Quote|It's touching. Karsus's heart bleeds for what he did.|[[Takari Moonsnow]]}}",
        "Description": "The ''Karsestone'' appeared as a man-sized, luminescent white boulder with a significant crack running along its top. It continually pulsed like a still-beating heart, pouring silver-colored liquid from the crack and forming a pool within the temple's floor.",
        "Powers": "The liquid of the ''Karsestone'' turned red as blood as it flowed out of a narrow passageway within the butte, This liquid was ''whole magic'', a substance that held powerful arcane properties that could bolster the power of any spellcaster that tapped into it.",
        "History": "The ''Karsestone'' was formed in the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, when Karsus achieved momentary apostheosis. This grave deed caused all magic in the realms to become inert and the [[Netherese enclave|flying cities]] of [[Netheril]] to come crashing down to the earth.\n\nOn [[Nightal 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, a group of travelers led by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] and [[Galaeron Nihmedu]] found the ''Karsestone'' within Karsus' temple, after nearly a [[tenday]]'s travel from Evereska in search of the artifact. At sunrise the [[Hammer 1|following day]] they fought off both the [[lich]] [[Wulgreth (Ascalhorn)|Wulgreth]] and his [[undead]] servant [[Jhingleshod]] in order to gain its control. While Melegaunt was slain by the lich, Galaeron removed the ''Karsestone'' from the temple and elevated it to the sky initiating [[the Return]] of [[Thultanthar]] to the [[Prime Material plane]].\n\nThe [[Shadovar]] of Thultanthar lost the ''Karsestone'' on [[Eleasis 2]] that year, when several [[chosen]] of [[Mystra]] raided the flying city and damaged it's ''[[mythallar]]''. While the whereabouts of the ''Karsestone'' were lost to most of those in the Realms, it remained in the hands of the goddess [[Shar]].",
        "Notable Owners": "While not its owner per se, the ''Karsestone'' was made into a [[phylactery]] by Wulgreth of [[Ascalhorn]] sometime around his mortal death in the 9{{th}} century DR.\n\nIt was considered a holy [[relic]] by the [[cult of Karsus]], along with the rest of his petrified body."
