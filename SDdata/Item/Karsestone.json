        "mainbody": "he Karsestone was the petrified heart of the Momentary God Karsus, a powerful artifact that remained the only source of whole magic in the Realms following Karsuss Folly. For millennia it was embedded within the Karsus Butte,\nThe Karsestone appeared as a man-sized, luminescent white boulder with a significant crack running along its top. It continually pulsed like a still-beating heart, pouring silver-colored liquid from the crack and forming a pool within the temples floor.\nThe liquid of the Karsestone turned red as blood as it flowed out of a narrow passageway within the butte, This liquid was whole magic, a substance that held powerful arcane properties that could bolster the power of any spellcaster that tapped into it.\nThe Karsestone was formed in the , when Karsus achieved momentary apostheosis. This grave deed caused all magic in the realms to become inert and the flying cities of Netheril to come crashing down to the earth.\nOn Nightal 30 in the , a group of travelers led by Melegaunt Tanthul and Galaeron Nihmedu found the Karsestone within Karsus temple, after nearly a tendays travel from Evereska in search of the artifact. At sunrise the following day they fought off both the lich Wulgreth and his undead servant Jhingleshod in order to gain its control. While Melegaunt was slain by the lich, Galaeron removed the Karsestone from the temple and elevated it to the sky initiating the Return of Thultanthar to the Prime Material plane.\nThe Shadovar of Thultanthar lost the Karsestone on Eleasis 2 that year, when several chosen of Mystra raided the flying city and damaged its mythallar. While the whereabouts of the Karsestone were lost to most of those in the Realms, it remained in the hands of the goddess Shar.\nWhile not its owner per se, the Karsestone was made into a phylactery by Wulgreth of Ascalhorn sometime around his mortal death in the 9 century DR.\nIt was considered a holy relic by the cult of Karsus, along with the rest of his petrified body."
