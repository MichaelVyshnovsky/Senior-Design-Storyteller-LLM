        "mainbody": "The o-yoroi was a type of armor used in Kara-Tur.\nThe o-yoroi was a comprehensive ensemble of laced armor, comprising various components such as kote, do-maru, sode, haidate, kabuto, and sune-ate. Additionally, it included several smaller pieces, including the mempo (face mask), nodawa (neck guard), wakibiki (armpit guards), sendan-no-ita, and hato-wo-no-ita (guards for the front of the armpit).\nCrafted as a matched set, the o-yoroi exhibited harmonious colors and patterns that complemented each other. This not only enhanced the visual appeal but also improved the overall fit of the armor, resulting in a superior armor compared to a collection of mismatched pieces."
