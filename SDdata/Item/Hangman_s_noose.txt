'''Hangman's nooses''' were a type of sweet [[spice]]d curiously-shaped [[bread]] from the [[wizard]] nation of [[Halruaa]].

{{quote|''Two of the hangman's nooses! And can you swirl them around in the spice again? Make them good and sticky?''|[[Tzigone]], the hero of the [[Battle of Akhlaur's Swamp]]}}

==Description==
Halruaa was home to several types of sweet breads beloved by locals. One such sweet treat was called hangman's noose for its district shape of a braided pastry ending in a loop on the bottom. The sweet dough was shaped and fried in hot bubbling fat, growing plump and crunchy. When cooked, the nooses were left to dry on wooden T-shaped racks. When ready to serve, hangman's nooses were generously dusted and rolled in powdered [[sugar]] and a mix of several rare local spices: [[allspice]], [[cardamom]], and [[mace (spice)|mace]].

The cauldrons of bubbling fat were ket hot with simple [[spell]]s, which made anything cooked in them unavailable to the nation's [[jordaini]] population, as they were forbidden from using anything magical.

==History== 
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, one of the fried bread stalls that sold hangman's noose in [[Halarahh]] stood shaded by bright red [[silk]] and shaded by tree canopies on the city's markets, not far from the [[Arbor Square]]. A young talented spell-slinger and a future war hero Tzigone, frequented the stall and once purchased the bread for several small currency wedge-shaped [[electrum]]s for her [[jordaini]] ally [[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]], who turned the offer down due to the bread being cooked with the use of magic, taboo to the jordaini.
