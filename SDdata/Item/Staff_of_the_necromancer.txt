The staff of the necromancer was a unique enchanted staff that belonged to Hodkamset, a powerful wizard who served Set.
The alabaster staff was made from the spine bones of a dragon.
The staff of the necromancer absorbed magic similar to a staff of the magi. The staff could detect magic, speak with the dead, and offered protection from good. The staff had 25 charges that could be used for additional powers. The staff could animate dead, cast darkness, 15 radius, dispel magic, and hold person by expending a single charge. Expending two charges allowed the wielder to command undead, enfeeble, feeblemind, and life level drain that automatically drained a portion of a targets memories and experiences.
The Staff of the necromancer was created by Hodkamset as a replica of the Alabaster Staff, a legendary artifact created by the Untheric pantheon in ancient times. However, it was said that the Alabaster Staff was twenty-five times more powerful than the Staff of the necromancer. 
The staff was stolen from Hodkamset by priests of Osiris, but later returned to him after it was retrieved by Sets assassins.
