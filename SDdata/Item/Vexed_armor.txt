The '''''vexed armor''''' was a unique [[breastplate]] that contained the essence of the [[glabrezu]] known as [[Vexing Thoughts]].

==Description==
The ''vexed armor'' was a fiery [[enchanted]] plate—in reality, a [[demon]] that manifested itself as a set of armor of abyssal defense. The breastplate's front bore a malefic face; everything about its form and shape felt wicked yet meticulous.

==Powers==
The ''vexed armor'' was warm to the touch, making its magical nature quite obvious. When worn, the armor could not be removed unless a [[spell]] of ''[[remove curse]]'' was cast. The wearer received a boost to their constitution and gained complete immunity to all magical and mundane cold.

==History==
Many years before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the glabrezu known as Vexing Thoughts was summoned and bound to this breastplate. The summoner used the glabrezu's true name—[[Chalimandren]]—for the ritual. Subsequently, the name was forgotten, allowing Vexing Thoughts to kill the conjurer. By 1281 DR, the ''vexed armor'' was abandoned on the [[Burial Isle]] in the great northern lake of [[Maer Dualdon]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. The armor called to sentient beings and wanted to be worn. But those who were unwise enough to don the breastplate were forced into a battle of wills with the glabrezu and, eventually, killed. Only individuals who learned the creature's true name could have any hope of surviving wearing the armor and forcing the demon to submit to their will, with it serving as a powerful enchanted set of armor.
