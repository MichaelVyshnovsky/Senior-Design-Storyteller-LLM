A medallion of thoughts was a magic item that allowed its user to read minds.
The medallion allowed anyone wearing it to cast the detect thoughts spell up to three times a day. It recovered part of its magical capabilities at every dawn.
The sea hag Myldryd Urchinspine kept a chest containing a medallion of thoughts among other things, in the wreckage of the Dirty Dastard on the Snout of Omgar, off the coast of Chult.
