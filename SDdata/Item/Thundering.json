        "mainbody": "Thundering was a magical weapon quality.\nWhen a weapon of this type hit a creature in a vital area, it produced a loud sound like thunder. This sound was powerful enough to damage the creature hit, and that creature could be permanently deafened by the noise. The wielder of the thundering weapon was not affected.\nA spellcaster needed the blindness/deafness spell to create a weapon with this ability.\nSome experienced Thayan gladiators had their horns, claws, and other natural weapons enhanced as thundering weapons. \nHelmed horrors could enhance their blades with several magical qualities, including flaming burst."
