Sunderstone was a magical warhammer that belonged to Korin Honedaxe, a dwarven hero who was buried with honors long before the Weeping Wars advent, in the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor in Myth Drannor and guarded by dwarven statue golems.
Sunderstone was a very heavy warhammer cast out of lead and encrusted in a steel external layer.
Against most opponents, Sunderstone was a fearsome weapon that possessed a +4 enchantment, with the same enchantment reducing the wielders intelligence. The warhammers true powers were revealed when used against constructs, Sunderstone effectively became a +7 enchanted weapon that also increased the wielders strength.
The warhammer also allowed its user to cast the remove paralysis spell.
Sunderstone along with its ancient owner were entombed long before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War. Even though the catacombs where the tomb was located were regularly raided by drow, orcs, orogs, and the Cult of the Dragon, in 1369 DR, Sunderstone was still inside its masters tomb. Along with a few other crypts of heroes in the depths of the Elven Catacombs, the Receiver of Respect was the part of the tomb. It was designed to release the legendary weapon in exchange for another mundane warhammer in times of dire need.
