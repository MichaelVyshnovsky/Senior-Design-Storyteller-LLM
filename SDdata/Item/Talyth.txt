'''Talyth''' was a popular snack and appetizer that usually consisted of a [[crackers|cracker]] topped with [[sausage]], [[cheese]], and [[herb]]s.

==Description==
The most common talyth was made with a cracker roughly the size of a smaller [[human]]s palm. The cracker was topped with a thinly sliced [[sausage]], various [[Herb|herbs]], and [[spices]]. The layers were glued together with a mash of various foods and baked to hold together. Various regional versions of talyth could include a wide variety of delicacies, such as [[Snail|snails]], [[Oyster|oysters]], spiced [[Worm|worms]], diced [[Egg|eggs]], and [[cheese]] mixes.

Talyth could be sweet, but savory versions were much more common.

==Production==
Fresh talyths were cooked daily in many places like [[Waterdeep]], [[Neverwinter]], [[Luskan]], [[Mirabar]], [[Elturel]], [[Everlund]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Scornubel]]. In winter months, talyths were pre-made and kept on ice until ready to be re-heated and served.

==History==
The advent of talyth's popularity happened gradually throughout the [[1300 DR|1300s DR]], starting early in the century from the ports of [[Cormyr]], [[Westgate]], and [[Sembia]], and spreading throughout the [[Sword Coast]] as the century went on.

In [[1490 DR|1490s DR]], a [[Sembia]]n recipe for talyth was fairly popular and commonly found in the homes, taverns, and adventuring camps around [[Luskan]].
