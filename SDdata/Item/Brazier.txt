'''Braziers''' were simple devices that could be used to burn materials (such as [[incense]]), make a light source, or to house [[burner]]s to provide a low but constant source of heat.

==Description==
{{SI|6|ft}} temple braziers, {{SI|4|ft}} chapel braziers, and field braziers were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. They sold [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]] variants of each.. The catalogue also sold special bronze braziers that came with matching burners and bronze braziers that stood atop tripod stands.

==Notable Braziers==
Braziers were often [[item enchantment|enchanted]] for the purposes of summoning and controlling
creatures, or just to create magical effects that covered large areas. Some such braziers included the following:
* ''[[Brazier of commanding fire elementals]]'', a variety of magical braziers that allowed one to control [[fire elemental]]s.
* ''[[Brazier of sleep smoke]]'', a variety of magical braziers that looked identical to a ''brazier of commanding fire elementals'' but were actually a deadly trap.<ref>

==Notable Users of Braziers==
===Classes===
* Braziers were considered to be an essential item in any [[wizard]]'s laboratory. 
===Magic===
* A [[brass]] brazier was a required [[material component]] for the [[spell]] ''[[find familiar]]''.
===Religions===
* [[Lolthite]] temples typically featured large braziers that were ornately carved with [[spider]] shapes.
