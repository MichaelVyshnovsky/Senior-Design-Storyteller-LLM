Braziers were simple devices that could be used to burn materials (such as incense), make a light source, or to house burners to provide a low but constant source of heat.
 temple braziers,  chapel braziers, and field braziers were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. They sold gold, silver, and bronze variants of each.. The catalogue also sold special bronze braziers that came with matching burners and bronze braziers that stood atop tripod stands.
Braziers were often enchanted for the purposes of summoning and controlling
creatures, or just to create magical effects that covered large areas. Some such braziers included the following
* Brazier of commanding fire elementals, a variety of magical braziers that allowed one to control fire elementals.
* Brazier of sleep smoke, a variety of magical braziers that looked identical to a brazier of commanding fire elementals but were actually a deadly trap.
* Braziers were considered to be an essential item in any wizards laboratory. 
* A brass brazier was a required material component for the spell find familiar.
* Lolthite temples typically featured large braziers that were ornately carved with spider shapes.
