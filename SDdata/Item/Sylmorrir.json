        "Powers": "''Sylmorrir'' was a sturdy shield imbued with defensive ''+6'' enchantments that stopped and defected enemy blows. The shield also boosted the wielder's reflexes and dexterity at the pice of slightly reduced constitution and fortitude. Additionally, ''Sylmorrir'' allowed the wielder to cast a powerful version of the ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, ''Sylmorrir'' was stashed within the lair of a [[lich]] who dwelt in the passages underneath [[Castle Cormanthor]], along with another unique enchanted item, ''[[Hammer Veneficus]]'', as well as the lich's ''[[phylactery]]''. The treasures were guarded by eight [[mohrg]]s, subservient to their [[undead]] master."
