'''Brainflight''' was an [[alchemical]] substance that was addictive and dangerous.

==Powers==
It caused hallucinations, addiction, wildly erratic behaviour, and over time, a personality breakdown rendering the user [[chaotic evil]]. It may likely have had other effects as well.

==History==
The substance was likely difficult to synthesize,{{Cite dragon/163/Hedge Wizards|24}} requiring a combination of solid alchemical and herbal skills; [[hedge wizard]]s who valued money more than other people's lives traded in it, as did some other lowlives. On the other hand, while it probably contained difficult to get ingredients, it might not have been that difficult to make afterwards.{{cite book/The Magic Encyclopedia Volume Two|109}}

The substance was often limited in its availability more by legality than anything else.

==Reputation==
Brainflight was associated with the jaded, tense, dissatisfied, and those who were greedy.
