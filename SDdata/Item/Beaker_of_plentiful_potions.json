        "mainbody": "A '''''beaker of plentiful potions''''' was a [[magic item]] that could create [[potion]]s.",
        "Description": "These items appeared to be normal [[jug]]s or [[flask]]s.",
        "Powers": "The magic of a ''beaker of plentiful potions'' allowed it to create 2—5 potions, each with 2—5 doses. The nature of the potions created were usually random and could include potions that carried negative effects and even [[poison]]s.\n\nOnce opened, a ''beaker of plentiful potions'' gradually lost its ability to create potions until eventually the magic disappeared. This occurred over the course of several months.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Siamorphe]], the Divine Right, carried a chalice that functioned as a ''beaker of plentiful potions'' which she used to create both ''[[holy water]]'' and any specific potion she required."
