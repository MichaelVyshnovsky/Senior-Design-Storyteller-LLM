        "mainbody": "A beaker of plentiful potions was a magic item that could create potions.\nThese items appeared to be normal jugs or flasks.\nThe magic of a beaker of plentiful potions allowed it to create 2—5 potions, each with 2—5 doses. The nature of the potions created were usually random and could include potions that carried negative effects and even poisons.\nOnce opened, a beaker of plentiful potions gradually lost its ability to create potions until eventually the magic disappeared. This occurred over the course of several months.\nSiamorphe, the Divine Right, carried a chalice that functioned as a beaker of plentiful potions which she used to create both holy water and any specific potion she required."
