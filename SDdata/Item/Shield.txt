Shields were a type of armor used on Toril, often carried by a wide variety of warriors.
Shields were usually made from wood or metal, and were used by combatants to gain extra protection. Shields were carried in one hand, usually strapped to the arm that carried them. Smaller shields could be used without compromising the use of both hands. Shields could be used in attacks to bash or push opponents, and some shields had spikes attached to them be more devastating when used as a weapon.
