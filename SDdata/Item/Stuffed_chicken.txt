'''Stuffed chicken''' was the specialty dish served at [[Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House]] in [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]].

==Description==
Stuffed [[chicken]] was jam-packed with [[bread]] and [[onion]]s. The chicken was cooked in a bowl of fragrant sauces until the meat was tender enough to melt in the gravies it was served in.

==History==
Rumnthorygh's stuffed chicken was served in the mid-to-late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] and was considered to be the best item on the inn's menu. Other items were still quality foods but nowhere as memorable as the chicken-bread-onion-sauced medley of tastes. The dish was endorsed by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in one of his published travel guides.
