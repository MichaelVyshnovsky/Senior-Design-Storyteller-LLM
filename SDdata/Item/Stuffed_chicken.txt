Stuffed chicken was the specialty dish served at Rumnthoryghs Welcoming House in Mosstone, Tethyr.
Stuffed chicken was jam-packed with bread and onions. The chicken was cooked in a bowl of fragrant sauces until the meat was tender enough to melt in the gravies it was served in.
Rumnthoryghs stuffed chicken was served in the mid-to-late-14 century DR and was considered to be the best item on the inns menu. Other items were still quality foods but nowhere as memorable as the chicken-bread-onion-sauced medley of tastes. The dish was endorsed by Volothamp Geddarm in one of his published travel guides.
