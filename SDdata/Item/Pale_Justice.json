        "mainbody": "'''''Pale Justice''''' was a [[holy avenger]] crafted with the sole purpose to destroy [[evil]] throughout the Realms.\n\n{{Quote|Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power...(it is) the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant.|Edan the Tyrran priest.}}",
        "Description": "{{Quote|Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison.|A Helmite bodyguard, mocking the appearance of ''Pale Justice''.}}\n\nDespite its powerful properties, ''Pale Justice'' was notably plain in appearance.",
        "Powers": "The sword was blessed by the god [[Tyr]] with a ''+4 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''. It struck more true and inflicted more grievous wounds against any malevolent beings it struck.\n\nWhomever wielded it became immune to a number of [[spell]]s that ''[[cloak of fear|instilled fear]]'' and ''[[horror]]'' within others.",
        "History": "{{Quote|I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility.|Edan, speaking of the sword's origins.}}\n\n''Pale Justice'' was originally forged as a non-magical blade by by a [[Tyrran]] smithy named [[Renold]], some time during or before the midâ€“13{{th}} century [[DR]]. Renold humbly offered the non-magical sword to [[Edan]], a devout acolyte in the [[church of Tyr]]. Edan and other priest of the local temple beseeched Tyr to [[item enchantment|bless the sword]] with divine power, but saw no change in its form or essence. All but one of the priests gave up on the effort, save for Edan, who continued his prayers for 30 years.\n\nWhen a group of visiting priests of [[Helm]] mocked Edan for his futile prayers, the Tyrran priests lifted the blade from upon the altar. He stated that Tyr's work with the sword had been completed years ago. A guardsman of the Helmite priests drew his own, heavily-ornamented sword and ridiculed ''Pale Justice''. Edan gently tapped the other sword with ''Pale Justice'' and saw that the overly-adorned blade break in the guardsman's hand.\n\nEdan commissioned a simple, [[leather]]-wrapped wooden handle for the sword. He bestowed it upon a young [[paladin]] with the request he always bear in mind the profound graciousness humankind is capable of.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the sword remained in the possession of an unknown individual who died within the Artisan's District of [[Dorn's Deep]]."
