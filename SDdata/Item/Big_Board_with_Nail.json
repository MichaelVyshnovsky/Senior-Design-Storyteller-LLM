        "mainbody": "The '''''Big Board with Nail''''', or simply a '''goblin herder''', was a unique but deadly [[hobgoblin]] bludgeon that once was a symbol of power among [[gnome]]s of the village of [[Treeroot]].",
        "Powers": "''Big Board with Nail'' was enchanted to be effective when wielded against [[goblinoid]]s, effectively becoming a ''+3'' magic weapon. The [[club]]'s [[nail]] also increased punishment dispensed with additional piercing damage. When \"goblin herder\" landed a successful hit, it had a good chance of [[daze|dazing]] and [[confusion|confusing]] its target.",
        "History": "Aptly named, ''Big Board with Nail'' was crafted by a hobgoblin chieftain named [[Slaul]] to be used as his \"goblin herder\" to ensure the obedience of his underlings. After some time, the club changed owners and ended up in the tiny gnome hands of Treeroot's residents. Ironically enough, the gnomes sought for an item to be used as a \"goblin herder\" as well. The ''Big Board with Nail'' was so successful as an anti-goblin tool, it was used as the symbol of rulership in Treeroot. Later, the club was reclaimed by goblins during a bloody raid.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], ''Big Board with Nail'' belonged to a [[goblin]] chieftain named the [[Butcher]]. He ran the hideout in caves underneath the [[Wild Pastures]] of [[Liam's Hold]] that sheltered the [[orc]] and [[tanarukk]]a army of the [[devil]] nemesis of [[Daggerford]], [[Gorgomorz]]. The goblin leader was slain by the [[Hero of Daggerford]] the same year."
