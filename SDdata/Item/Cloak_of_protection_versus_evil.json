[[Khelben Arunsun]] spent months training one of his student in creation of these cloaks to supply the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] with defensive and fashionable magic armor. Eventually that apprentice opened a shop where he started experimenting with designs and stiles of the ''cloaks of protection versus evil''."
