The '''''staff of devotion''''' was a magical item that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|52}}{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
These magical items were available in a wide variety.

==Powers==
''Staves of devotion'' could only be used by priests and clerics.

Any priest could use the following powers three times per day without draining any charges: ''[[atonement]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[create food and water]]'', ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[avert evil eye]]'', and ''[[purify food and drink]]''.

Each of the following powers consumed one charge: ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', and ''[[remove curse]]''.

Additionally, [[ethoist]]s, [[moralist]]s, and [[pragmatist]]s could use the following powers at the expense of three charges: ''[[flame strike]]'', ''[[holy word]]'', ''[[legend lore]]'', ''[[raise dead]]'', and ''[[restoration]]''.

Simply carrying the staff of devotion bolstered the immunity of the wielder to many forms of attacks including poison and elemental attacks.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Renn min Zann]], an Imam in [[Huzuz]], carried a ''staff of devotion''.
