Amulets of will were enchanted necklaces that were created to protect the minds of Harper agents from being broken.
These amulets enchantment improved the wearers will and mental defenses.
These amulets were created for a high-ranking Harper bard named Jeraboam Cantor who sought to secure the minds of his fellow Harper spies and the secrets held within them. Ironically enough, Jeraboam was one of the first Harpers captured by their enemies while wearing an amulet of will. The amulet was taken off his neck, quickly exposing his weak mind to magical probing, revealing all the secrets he was keeping.
By the late 14 century DR, these amulets became fairly common along the Sword Coast.
