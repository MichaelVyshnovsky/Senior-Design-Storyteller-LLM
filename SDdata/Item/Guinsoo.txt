'''''Guinsoo''''' was a [[magic]]al [[dagger]] that could be thrown at enemies.

==Description==
This unique weapon was found in the upper [[Waterdeep]] sewers. The [[Heroes of Waterdeep]], having entered the first floor of the sewers, may have come across a collection of magical [[scroll]]s on a shelf. The enchanted dagger, ''Guinsoo'', appeared by placing an ordinary dagger on to the shelf.<ref group="note">The clue to acquire ''Guinsoo'' was ''"The magic that appears to protect may also empower a weapon..."''. The magical weapon had a ''+4'' enchantment.
