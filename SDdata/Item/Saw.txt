'''Saws''' were cutting tools used to carve through [[wood]], [[stone]], [[steel]], limbs, and more.

==Description==
Saws had toothed metal blades, but otherwise varied in size, shape, and use. Types included:
[[File:Amputation saw.png|thumb|''A set of amputation saws.'']]
* '''[[Amputation saw]]s''', a category of smaller saws used to remove limbs and prevent [[gangrene]].
* '''Crosscut saw''', the most common type of saw which sold for 3 [[gp]] from ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
* '''[[Folding saw]]''', a portable saw large enough to fell trees
* '''Framed jigsaw''' (8gp), which was sometimes sold with [[diamond]] teeth for the purpose of cutting through stone (17 gp).
* '''[[Hacksaw]]''' (5 gp), used for cutting through metal with diamond-toothed versions (15 gp) able to cut through stone and even more superior versions (20 gp) able to cut through anything short of diamond itself.
* '''Two-person logging saw''' (15 gp), which could cut through wood five times faster than a common saw.
* '''Two-person ripsaw''' (7 gp).

Saws were ill-suited to be used as weapons.
