'''''Dredging claw''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[halberd]] from the city of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]].

==Description==
''Dredging claw's'' design was a clue of its previous use. The halberd's shaft had a solid [[iron]] core, and despite it, it was significantly more lightweight than other similar weapons. The hook at the top of the halberd's head was used to latch onto ships and keep them close for boarding. ''Dredging claw'' showed little wear and tear from being used as a weapon. Despite its naval use, the halberd was perfect for skewering [[goblin]]s from a distance.

==Powers==
The weapons possessed a simple ''+1'' enchantment.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, ''dredging claw'' could be found among weapons sold by [[Deirdre Gallaway]] in the [[Gallaway Trade Depot]] in Targos.
