        "mainbody": "'''Grimoires''', sometimes called '''greatbooks''', were formal, ordered collections of [[spell]]s.",
        "Description": "Greatbooks tended to be locked, guarded, and hidden, either in a secure cache or in a [[wizard]]'s abode. Most were composed with gilded ornamentation or inks, and they might even have had plates of polished [[ivory]] or [[platinum]] within them, engraved or stamped with [[Arcane magic|arcane]] writings. They were usually large and often of unusual proportions (such as very tall for their width), and many had metal-bound corners (i.e., ornate protective caps) and chased or relief-carved covers.",
        "Notable Grimoires": "* [[Warlock]]s who accepted the [[Pact of the Tome]] were gifted a grimoire of spells from their [[otherworldly patron]]."
