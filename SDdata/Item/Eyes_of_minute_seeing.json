These items magic made it possible to discern the smallest seams, markings, details, or even impressions on paper or parchment. With the use of eyes of minute seeing, one could easily notice hidden compartments, secret mechanisms, or hidden joints.\nThe effect of using one of the eyes of minute seeing was similar to the effects of the eyes of the eagle spell.\nThese objects were examples of the objects that could be created by following the instructions that the Maior Creare Nether Scrolls could bestow.\nBefore the fall of Myth Drannor in 714 DR, the City of Songs Court Magi carried eyes of minute seeing as a part of their standard gear.\nCirca 1489 DR, a kaleidoscopic monocle that was a variation of eyes of minute seeing, was brought to Torils Icewind Dale onboard of the crushed nautiloid Id Ascendant. The enchanted monocle could be found in the captains quarters of the spelljammer.\n*Ecaeris Aunglor an elven Spell-Captain of per-Weeping War Myth Drannor who was known for her perfectionism and attraction to humans and the arcane.\n*Jannaxil Serpentil the proprietor of Serpentil Books & Folios in Waterdeep circa mid-14 century DR.\n*Torm an adventuring thief member of the Knights of Myth Drannor owned numerous magical gadgets, including eyes of minute seeing."
