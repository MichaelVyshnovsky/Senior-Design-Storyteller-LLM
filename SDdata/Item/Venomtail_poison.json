        "mainbody": "'''Venomtail poison''' was a potent [[poison]] used by the [[assassin]]s and [[hunter]]s of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]].",
        "Description": "The poison was extracted from the giant and rare [[giant scorpion|venomtail scorpion]]s native to the Chultan jungle, especially around the [[River Soshenstar]]. The poison itself was thus regarded as a trophy among hunters.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the sale of venomtail poison in Port Nyanzaru was strictly controlled by the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Jessamine]]. Even so, some hunters were known to trade it amongst themselves, notably [[Doriak|Doriak of the Shells]], who would exchange it for [[flask]]s of [[sulfur]] that could be used to lure out [[fire scorpion]]s."
