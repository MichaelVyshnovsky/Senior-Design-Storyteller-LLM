        "mainbody": "enomtail poison was a potent poison used by the assassins and hunters of Port Nyanzaru in Chult.\nThe poison was extracted from the giant and rare venomtail scorpions native to the Chultan jungle, especially around the River Soshenstar. The poison itself was thus regarded as a trophy among hunters.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the sale of venomtail poison in Port Nyanzaru was strictly controlled by the merchant prince Jessamine. Even so, some hunters were known to trade it amongst themselves, notably Doriak of the Shells, who would exchange it for flasks of sulfur that could be used to lure out fire scorpions."
