'''''Ivy wraps''''' were a pair of magical [[handwraps]] found in the [[Druid's Deep]] of [[Thorngap]] in [[Cormyr]] during the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|These handwraps are made of heavy strips of leather for padding, with vicious, thorned vines wrapped and knotted around them. The vines seem to brighten at the taste of blood.
}}
==Description==
The handwraps were made of leather and tied with knotted thorny vines.

==Powers==
The thorns on the ''ivy wraps'' were savage and caused deep hemorrhaging wounds, as well as draining blood and healing the user in a vampiric manner. The thorns oozed virulent [[poison]]s and toxins, even causing [[acid]]ic secondary reactions that further burned the recipient.

==History==
The handwraps were found in the Druid's Deep of Thorngap when [[adventurer]]s pursued the insane [[druid]] [[Halsaime]]. They were in the possession of the [[bog hag]] [[Aghilde]], who lurked nearby.
