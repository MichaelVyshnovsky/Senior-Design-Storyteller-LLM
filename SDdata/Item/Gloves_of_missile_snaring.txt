'''''Gloves of missile snaring''''', also known as '''''gloves of arrow snaring''''', were [[magic item|magical]] [[glove]]s that allowed their wearer to attenuate the impact of projectiles, or even to catch them mid-flight.

==Description==
''Gloves of missile snaring'' were snug and seemed to meld with the hands of their wearer once put on, becoming almost invisible.

==Powers==
The wearer of a pair of ''gloves of missile snaring'' was empowered with quick reflexes to deflect projectiles from ranged weapons, such as [[arrow]]s or [[dart]]s, considerably reducing the damage dealt by them, or even negating it completely. In the latter case, the wearer could choose to grab projectiles mid-air

They were only effective if both gloves were worn and if the wearer had at least one free hand with which to catch the projectile.
