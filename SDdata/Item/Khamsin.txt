Khamsin was a potent magical poison sometimes used by Holy slayer assassins of the Wind of Fate in Zakhara.
Khamsin smelled like honey.
Khamsin was a contact poison that was often applied to darts. A deceitful way to use the poison was to apply it to the hilts of weapons and offer them as gifts. Once skin contact with this poison was made, the victim literally turned to dust within minutes.
