A skull blade was an enchanted, +1 unholy longsword wielded by the followers of Cyric.
The blades and hilts of these swords were adorned with the holy symbol of Cyric. Agents of the Prince of Lies who traveled incognito typically covered their blades to prevent easy detection when traveling across the Realms.
