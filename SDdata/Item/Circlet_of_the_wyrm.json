        "mainbody": "A circlet of the wyrm was a magical circlet that granted a dragon the powers of an elder of its race.\nThe bands were made of platinum, usually unadorned.\nBesides expanding and contracting to fit the brow of any dragons, the circlets granted their users almost all of the powers that age could bring, as if theyd attained an age of a thousand years, including both combat prowess and magical ability. For dragons of a thousand years, no additional powers were gained. For wyrms over 1,200 years of age, the circlet was counter-productive.\nThe circlet had a narrow chance of falling off in combat, which increased during wingover maneuvers or when grappling with another dragon. When it was removed, the dragon losing it was stunned for up to five minutes. It also fell off if the dragon changed shape.\nAurgloroasa had been presented with one such circlet by the Cult of the Dragon at some point between  and .\nA stronger version which took their abilities to the true pinnacle of what age could bring, the circlet of the great wyrm, was known only from legends as none had been actually found in recorded history.\n*Aurgloroasa"
