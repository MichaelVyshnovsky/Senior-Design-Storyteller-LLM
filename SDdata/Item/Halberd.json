        "mainbody": "A halberd () was a widely used member of the poleaxe family of polearms, that could best be described as somewhat of a cross between an axe and a spear.\nThe business end of a halberd consisted of three parts the axe-head, the back spike or \"fluke\", and the spear tip that surmounted it. While many polearms had a similar structure, halberds had a few distinguishing features. Their axe-heads were concave (curving inward) to nearly straight, instead of convex like most axes. And were set at an angle to the shaft, instead of being mounted perpendicular.\nThe fluke of a halberd, which was fairly short and angled slightly downward, helped to balance the weapon. It was sometimes replaced by a hook for dismounting cavalry. The sharp spear-like spike that surmounted the fluke was usually of quadrangular design, but varied in length and size. Some were long and slender, while others were broader and of a medium length.\nThe average halberd measured  in length, or longer with their spear tips.\nHalberds were extremely versatile against a wide range of opponents due to ability to unleash slashing, thrusting, tripping, or dismounting attacks. Dismounting in particular was a main function of the weapon. And were quite effective against plate armor. However, due to their size halberds were rather slow, unwieldy, and often considered detrimental in close quarters combat. \nHalberdiers could attack the flanks of a pike formation with great effect, due to pikemen being unable to bring their much longer weapons to bear in close combat.\nBusiness and merchants in the Realms where one could purchase halberds from included\n* A number of merchants in Athkatlas market Waukeens Promenade commonly sold halberds, including the fruit merchant Enge and Ribald Barterman from his store Adventurer Mart.
