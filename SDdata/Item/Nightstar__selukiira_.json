It contained more than seventy spells.\nAfter the destruction of House Dlardrageth by the Coronal of Arcorar, Ithraides discovered the selukiira and concealed it, but created three telkiira that would lead to its location. Araevin Teshurr recovered the Nightstar from the vault of Ithraides beneath a white tower in the Elven Court area of the forest of Cormanthor.\nCategoryArtifacts\nCategoryLesser artifacts\nCategoryItems\nCategoryItems from Toril\nrb7g95j9gv94va82ucdymvpdb2oarj1"
