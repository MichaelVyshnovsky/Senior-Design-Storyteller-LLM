Pigs Head was an Amnian delicacy prepared out of a whole pig or hogs head.
The traditional Amnian cooking method included the head being baked in quality oils and dusted with various spices.
In 1492 DR, the goblin followers of the Absolute outside of the Emerald Grove enjoyed this particular sophisticated dish in their camp.
