        "Powers": "''Mail of Fennibal \"Thunder\" Bale'' was an [[iron]] set of [[heavy armor]]. It possessed a humble ''+1'' defensive enchantment. However, what made it distinct was the magic that created a ''[[sound burst]]'' every time the wearer of the mail was hit.",
        "History": "This enchanted armor belonged to [[Fennibal Bale]], a hero who lost his life in the {{YearlinkName|1065}} during the Battle of Ingdal's Arm. The one-man wrecking crew wore the armor when he charged directly into the [[human]] infantry on the other side of the conflict. He single-handedly knocked them back, eventually allowing his allies to win the battle.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Mail of Fennibal \"Thunder\" Bale'' was in the hands of one of the exotic and magic gear vendors doing business in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]]."
