        "mainbody": "Flamedance was the name in the Realms for rhodizite.\nThis precious stone was translucent and ranged in color from pale yellow to green. It was usually found in fragments and small crystals. Because it did not cleave well, it was mainly used for carving. Only crystals that could yield faceted gems were cut. A typical specimen had a base value of 500 gp.\nThese stones and any item on which they were mounted always resisted attacks from normal or magical fire. A creature wearing one or more of these gems gained a significant improvement in the chance to resist normal or magical fire-based attacks."
