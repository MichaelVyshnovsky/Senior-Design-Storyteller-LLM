        "History": "Historically, these shields could be seen in the hands of the most skilled mercenaries and assassins who targeted powerful mages. ''Anti-Magic Shields'' were nuisances even to such adepts at [[the Art]] as [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]], the Blackstaff of [[Waterdeep]]. However, many common folk said that these ''Mage-Killers'' simple \"leveled the field\".\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], ''Mage-Killer'' was among possessions of the [[Zhentarim]] squad stationed in [[Iyrauroth]]'s swamp in [[Thar]]."
