        "mainbody": "Bracers of artifice were powerful enchanted bracers created by the ancient Imaskari.\nDespite their simple unassuming appearance, these copper bracers held powerful defensive magics.\nThe wearer of a set of bracers of artifice received a magical defense identical to that of a set of full plate armor but with no drawbacks. The bracers only weighed a fraction of plate mails weight and imposed no restrictions on the wearers gesticulations, making them perfect defensive items for mages. In addition to protection, bracers of artifice boosted the wearers focus, allowing sorcerers to collect arcane energies more effectively and wizards to memorize an additional spell from the 8 circle of magic per day. Lastly, bracers of artifice granted the wearer minor resistance to magic.\nIn the , bracers of artifice could be found on the wrists of Red Wizards of Thay at the Academy of Shapers and Binders."
