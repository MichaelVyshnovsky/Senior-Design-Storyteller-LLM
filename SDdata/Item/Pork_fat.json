        "mainbody": "Pork fat, sometimes in the form of lard or bacon fat, was the fat of pigs and boars. It was generally for use in cooking.\nPork fat was popular for culinary applications in places like Cormyr, the Dalelands, Tethyr, and the Western Heartlands. The lard of wild boars was generally interchangeable with that of domestic pigs.\nPork fat could be either liquid or semi-solid, requiring that it be scooped. It was perishable and thus often stored in the same environments as pork or vegetables, but it could also be packaged in casks for transport, such as on ships. It was generally quite flammable.\nIn cooking, pork fat was measured by the \"knife\". It was often used to cook or fry other foods, such as fish, game fowl like quail, to low-class bloodlick, or pie and pastry dough.\nIn places like Ravens Bluff, rancid pork fat was sometimes boiled into a stew to feed to prisoners.\nIt was said that some elves had a form of rations that were patties made of corn, dried fruits, nuts, seeds and small candies that were held together by lard, honey, molasses and/or sugar.\nIn magic, a pinch of lard was used as a material component in the grease slick spell. It could also be used by alchemists and druids in the making of ointments by mixing it with dry or caky substances to allow it to be applied to the skin.\nPig fat could also be used as a lubricant. For example, it could make a smooth surface slippery, such as for setting a trap similar to a use of oil of slipperiness. Grapplers could also apply it to their skin to give them an edge against being grabbed, Some sages suggested applying a coating of pork fat over exposed skin prior to battling a steel dragon or black dragon in order to protect from the effects of the beasts breath weapons.\nPork fat could be found in pantries and larders across Faer√ªn. \nInns, taverns, and restaurants notable for their use of pork fat included\n* The High Moon Inn in Highmoon used it as a cooking medium.\n* Hot Highsun Handbreads in Gladehap used pork fat in their rabbit pate.\n* The Watchful Eye in Essembra used it when making the dough for its famous stuffed turkey pie.\n* Waukeens Rest on the Risen Road served potato wedges fried in pork fat.\n* Wyrmkindler Sausage Works in Gladehap used pork fat as part of the filling in their stag sausage.\nThere was said to exist a wondrous item known as the everful jug of lard which could provide an endless supply of pork fat for cooking."
