For example, it could make a smooth surface slippery, such as for setting a trap similar to a use of ''[[oil of slipperiness]]''.{{Cite dragon/273/Something Up Your Sleeve|52}} Grapplers could also apply it to their skin to give them an edge against being grabbed,{{Cite dragon/413/Spin a Yarn: Jantharl's Surprising Journey|20}} Some sages suggested applying a coating of pork fat over exposed skin prior to battling a [[steel dragon]] or [[black dragon]] in order to protect from the effects of the beasts' breath weapons."
