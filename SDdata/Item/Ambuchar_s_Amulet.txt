Ambuchars Amulet was a unique magic item that could be found within the Hordelands.
It was assumed that this item was made by Ambuchar Devayam and spoke on his behalf.
This large amulet was shaped like a golden skull with a pair of diamonds for eyes.
Ambuchars Amulet could speak like a sentient creature.
Anyone holding the amulet was magically compelled to place it around their neck. Once placed, the amulet could only be removed by a remove curse spell or a wish. When worn, the amulet would make sarcastic comments at the wearers expense.
