        "mainbody": "Staff of insect command was a hishna-enchanted staff and an artifact variant of a more common staff of command with one major difference in function â€“ it affected insects and insectoid creatures.\nStaves of insect command allowed the wielder to cast summon insects spell and a variant of speak with animals that allowed the caster speak to insects only. It also allowed them to cast giant insect and repel insects spells. Use of each spell consumed a single charge stored within the staff. When the wielder expended two charges, they could summon an insect plague. All creatures summoned or charmed with the staff of insect command were under the absolute control of the staffs master.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, Mirandos of Helm rediscovered the lost city Ixtzul in the deep jungles of Far Payit in Maztica. She exhumed the grave of Greyst, a Revered Counselor of Ixtzul, and stole the staff of insect command created by him. With the use of the magic item, she gained control of the insectoid bacars and their queen."
