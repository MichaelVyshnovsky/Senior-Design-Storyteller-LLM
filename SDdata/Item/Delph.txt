'''Delph''' was a type of hardy travel [[spices|spice]] endemic to the [[Old Empires]] region of [[east Faer√ªn]].

==Description==
Delph was yellowish in color and had a sharp [[onion]] taste to it. It could not tint things yellow and would become clear when cooked.

==Powers==
This spice had an incredibly long shelf-life, with even three-centuries-old delph still being good, though its taste was said to "thin" over time. In addition, delph never [[mold]]ed, mildewed, or spoiled no matter how damp the area it was storied in got. If used properly, it could even kill mold spores.

==Creation==
Delph was created by crushing and drying the yellow wildflowers that grew all across the high waste ground in [[Chessenta]], [[Mulhorand]], [[Threskel]], [[Unther]]. Though originally the practice began from the harvesting of such flowers in the [[Akanapeaks]].

==History==
Between [[1356 DR]]<ref> and [[1374 DR]], the [[Highmoon Trading Coster]] was one of the only mercantile companies known to trade delph across the [[Sword Coast]].

==Usages==
* Delph was often used in a similar manner to [[mustard]].
* Besides its standard use as seasoning, some were known to tightly roll up moldy rugs or clothing after sprinkling delph on them, finding a month later that the spice had banished the mold.
