Delph was a type of hardy travel spice endemic to the Old Empires region of east Faer√ªn.
Delph was yellowish in color and had a sharp onion taste to it. It could not tint things yellow and would become clear when cooked.
This spice had an incredibly long shelf-life, with even three-centuries-old delph still being good, though its taste was said to "thin" over time. In addition, delph never molded, mildewed, or spoiled no matter how damp the area it was storied in got. If used properly, it could even kill mold spores.
Delph was created by crushing and drying the yellow wildflowers that grew all across the high waste ground in Chessenta, Mulhorand, Threskel, Unther. Though originally the practice began from the harvesting of such flowers in the Akanapeaks.
Between 1356 DR and 1374 DR, the Highmoon Trading Coster was one of the only mercantile companies known to trade delph across the Sword Coast.
* Delph was often used in a similar manner to mustard.
* Besides its standard use as seasoning, some were known to tightly roll up moldy rugs or clothing after sprinkling delph on them, finding a month later that the spice had banished the mold.
