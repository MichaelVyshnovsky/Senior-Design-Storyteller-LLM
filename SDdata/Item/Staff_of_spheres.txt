The staff of spheres was a magical staff that created transparent floating bubbles.
The magical bubbles created by this staff measured  in diameter and could be directed to move by the bearer. Each individual sphere could contain up to  of matter. Exceeding this weight limit caused the sphere to cease to exist, along with anything contained within, including living matter. Piercing a sphere with any point would also destroy it.
Any living creature within a sphere enjoyed the benefits of a feather fall spell. The spheres did not serve as cages and any creature within a sphere could leave at any time.
The staff of spheres was originally created by Elminster in Myth Drannor.
