The dodecahedron of doom was a rather large die, both magical and mechanical in creation, that caused a number of arcane effects when it was thrown across the floor.
The metal dodecahedron had twelve sides, each of which was painted with a number 1 through 12. Overall, it measured 12" (30.5 cm) across. Clockwork machinery composed its inner workings, which whirled and clicked whenever the die was cast.
Depending on the side that faced up whenever the die was thrown, one of six possible effects occurred
* 1, 2 The dodecahedron burst in an explosion and was completely destroyed.
* 3, 4 A light spell was cast upon the die, which remained until it was touched by any creature.
* 5, 6 A ray of frost shot out from the die towards a random person or creature.
* 7, 8 The next creature to touch the dodecahedron was hit by a shocking grasp.
* 9, 10 A darkness spell was cast upon the die, lasting for 10 minutes.
* 11, 12 The next creature to touch the die became significantly more resilient for an hours time.
One of these dodecahedrons found its way into the scrap piles of Trobriands Graveyard, sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR.
