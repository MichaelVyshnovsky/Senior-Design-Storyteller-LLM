The '''''dodecahedron of doom''''' was a rather large die, both [[magic]]al and mechanical in creation, that caused a number of [[arcane]] effects when it was thrown across the floor.

==Description==
The metal dodecahedron had twelve sides, each of which was painted with a number 1 through 12. Overall, it measured 12" (30.5 cm) across. Clockwork machinery composed its inner workings, which whirled and clicked whenever the die was cast.

==Powers==
Depending on the side that faced up whenever the die was thrown, one of six possible effects occurred:
* 1, 2: The dodecahedron burst in an explosion and was completely destroyed.
* 3, 4: A ''[[light]]'' spell was cast upon the die, which remained until it was touched by any creature.
* 5, 6: A ''[[ray of frost]]'' shot out from the die towards a random person or creature.
* 7, 8: The next creature to touch the dodecahedron was hit by a ''[[shocking grasp]]''.
* 9, 10: A ''[[darkness]]'' spell was cast upon the die, lasting for 10 minutes.
* 11, 12: The next creature to touch the die became significantly more resilient for an hour's time.

==History==
One of these dodecahedrons found its way into the scrap piles of [[Trobriand's Graveyard]], sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}
