'''Smoke spheres''' were small incendiary devices crafted in [[Qadib]], the City of Sages, in the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]].

==Description==
A black smoke sphere measured {{SI|1|"|c|long=yes}} in diameter.

==Uses==
When thrown forcefully, a smoke sphere would explode upon striking a solid object. The explosion ignited a small flame and a spherical cloud of dark smoke measuring {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. The smoke hindered both normal vision and [[infravision]] and lasted for several minutes depending on the wind conditions. A smoke sphere exposed to fire would immediately explode.

Smoke spheres could only be purchased in rare alchemical shops throughout the Land of Fate. Their price was 8–18 [[gold piece]]s a piece in Qadib, the city of their origin, and 16–36 gold pieces a piece elsewhere in Zakhara.

==History==
Smoke spheres were commonly used by street performers and [[rogue]]s. They were carried by [[holy slayer]]s and every member of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].
