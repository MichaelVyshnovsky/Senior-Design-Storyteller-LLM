Smoke spheres were small incendiary devices crafted in Qadib, the City of Sages, in the Free Cities of Zakhara.
A black smoke sphere measured  in diameter.
When thrown forcefully, a smoke sphere would explode upon striking a solid object. The explosion ignited a small flame and a spherical cloud of dark smoke measuring  in diameter. The smoke hindered both normal vision and infravision and lasted for several minutes depending on the wind conditions. A smoke sphere exposed to fire would immediately explode.
Smoke spheres could only be purchased in rare alchemical shops throughout the Land of Fate. Their price was 8–18 gold pieces a piece in Qadib, the city of their origin, and 16–36 gold pieces a piece elsewhere in Zakhara.
Smoke spheres were commonly used by street performers and rogues. They were carried by holy slayers and every member of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.
