        "mainbody": "'''''Ethanniel's sling''''' was an enchanted [[elf|elven]] [[sling]] that could deliver devastating blows with simple bullets as well as with unmissable ''[[magic missile]]s''.",
        "Description": "''Ethanniel's sling'' was designed like many other ancient elven slings, a hand-held solid curved launching device that propelled round bullets toward its targets with a single swing, unlike regular leather slings.",
        "Powers": "This sling possessed a potent ''+5'' enchantment and increased its user's  dexterity and reflexes. Additionally, ''Ethanniel's sling'' could launch ''magic missiles'' projectiles instead of bullets. The number of ''magic missiles'' it could create was limited to six a day.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''Ethanniel's sling'' was looted off the corpse of one of the fallen [[Akh'Velahr]] by the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s [[dragonkin]]. The magical items they hoarded were stored inside the aerie in one of [[Castle Cormanthor]]'s towers that was used by the Cult's winged troops as a breeding ground."
