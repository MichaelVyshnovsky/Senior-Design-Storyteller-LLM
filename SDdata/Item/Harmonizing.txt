'''''Harmonizing''''' was a [[weapon quality]] that could be placed upon any melee weapon.

==Power==
When drawn, a ''harmonizing'' weapon would join its wielder when they sang, inspiring allies with courage and boosting morale. The weapon would continue to sing for several minutes after the wielder stopped singing based upon their natural charisma.

==Creation==
A [[cleric]] used the ''[[ghost sound]]'' [[spell]] to add the ''harmonizing'' quality to a weapon.
