Harmonizing was a weapon quality that could be placed upon any melee weapon.
When drawn, a harmonizing weapon would join its wielder when they sang, inspiring allies with courage and boosting morale. The weapon would continue to sing for several minutes after the wielder stopped singing based upon their natural charisma.
A cleric used the ghost sound spell to add the harmonizing quality to a weapon.
