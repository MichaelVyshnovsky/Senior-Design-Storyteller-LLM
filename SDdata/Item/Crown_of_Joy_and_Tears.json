        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the [[Knights of the Unicorn]] explored the Moonwood and entered the castle of El'lahana Raikeil. After they overcame a series of puzzles, they found the crown. Each of the knights interacted with the artifact, and the next thing they knew, they were jumping and dancing alongside [[unicorn]]s and [[elves]] close by a stream of silver. The knights decided to leave the crown in the elven castle and began to wander [[Faer√ªn]] freely once again. The leader of the group, [[Javalar Roaringhorn]], announced that none would be able to find the ''Crown'' again unless they entered the fortress with great joy and desires. The goddess herself was pleased with the Knights of the Unicorn, and appeared to them with her [[Silver Herd]]. After taking them for a grand ride, they pledged their services to the Unicorn Queen, and she blessed them with many great adventures."
