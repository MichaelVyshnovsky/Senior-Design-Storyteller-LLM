        "mainbody": "Vauv was a type of a nut-based dessert made by the Bedine folk of the Anauroch desert in north Faer√ªn.\nVauv was one of many types of desserts found throughout the Realms, similar to the Earths [https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halva halva]. Vauv was a very sweet treat made out of crushed dates, roasted and ground tharra, honey syrup, and wild rice flour. The mix was pressed into small handfood cakes and could keep through most months of the year apart from the hottest periods of time."
