Spider poles were a set of collapsible metal poles that could be arranged into a ladder or articulated frame.
Spider poles were extremely useful for climbing walls, though their intricate positioning required a degree of dexterity to assemble and disassemble correctly.
Strangely enough, Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue did not list a price for a set of spider poles.
