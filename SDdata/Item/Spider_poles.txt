'''Spider poles''' were a set of collapsible metal poles that could be arranged into a ladder or articulated frame.

==Uses==
Spider poles were extremely useful for climbing walls, though their intricate positioning required a degree of dexterity to assemble and disassemble correctly.

==Prices==
Strangely enough, [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] did not list a price for a set of spider poles.
