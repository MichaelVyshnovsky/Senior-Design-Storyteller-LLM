        "mainbody": "mask of beastliness was a magical mask created by barbarians that allowed the wearer to temporarily transform their head into that of a beast.\nMasks of beastliness were carved from wood in the likeness of a beasts visage, though with grotesquely exaggerated features, and colored in various dyes. They had eye slits to see through, holes in the creatures nose to breath through, and leather straps for a wearer to secure it around their head. The animals these masks were most commonly carved to resemble included buffalo, cobras, lions, ravens, rhinoceri, and wild stags.\nPressing a mask of beastliness against a wearers face for five consecutive minutes would cause it to fuse with the wearers flesh and animate, transforming the wearers head into that of the animal the mask was carved to resemble. This enabled a wearer to inflict greater harm upon their opponents or even inflict poison if their beast had such power, like that of a cobra. However, whilst a mask was active, its wearer was incapable of eating, speaking, or casting spells that required verbal components.\nThe effects of a mask of beastliness lasted for one hour and could only be activated once per day. To deactivate a mask, one simply had to slip their fingers under the chin area and push the mask away from the wearers face.\nSometime in the midâ€“14 century DR, a group of adventurers in Ravens Bluff found themselves magically transported by a painting to the land of Chult when searching for Cuthbert Maguluty. In order to return home, they had to retrieve a magical painting depicting Rupertyna Phyneus-Magulutys cottage that had been stolen by ptera-men. While at the village of the ptera-men, the adventurers found a small treasure hoard within the hut of their chieftain, containing such items as a mask of beastliness, ten spirit arrows, sixteen emeralds, and a dagger with a solid emerald pommel."
