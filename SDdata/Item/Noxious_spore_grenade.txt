Noxious spore grenades were filled with a substance of unbearable rank stench. When thrown, the grenades released their noxious fumes that affected those breathing it in with poison, similarly to the spores of the bibberbang fungus.
Noxious spore grenades can be created by combining a sublimate of myconid poison spores and certain type of alchemical ashes.
