'''''Choking powder''''' was a substance used as an incapacitating thrown weapon.

==Description==
This purple powder was mixed using several [[herb]]s and packed in throwable pouches.

==Powers==
Upon impact, ''choking powder'' pouches opened up, creating a small ''[[stinking cloud]]'' that dazed and caused uncontrollable coughing fits in those caught in it. The powder cloud lasted for thirty seconds.

==History==
These devious items became popular in [[Faer√ªn]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. These pouches were quite common in the [[Daggerford]], [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in [[1372 DR]].
