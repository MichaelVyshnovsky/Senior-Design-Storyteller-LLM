Choking powder was a substance used as an incapacitating thrown weapon.
This purple powder was mixed using several herbs and packed in throwable pouches.
Upon impact, choking powder pouches opened up, creating a small stinking cloud that dazed and caused uncontrollable coughing fits in those caught in it. The powder cloud lasted for thirty seconds.
These devious items became popular in Faer√ªn in the late 14 century DR. These pouches were quite common in the Daggerford, Delimbiyr Vale in 1372 DR.
