Potions of freedom, or elixirs of guileful movement, were a type of potion that promised the imbiber freedom of movement.
This potion was a strange and unnatural liquid that had a viscous texture of half-frozen honey, yet it flowed as smoothly as mercury.
This potion provided protection against all forms of paralysis. It was also effective against magical effects such as hold person and hold monster. 
An elixir of guileful movement could be created by a skilled alchemist through combining of alchemical suspension of ochre jelly and certain types of sublimates.
