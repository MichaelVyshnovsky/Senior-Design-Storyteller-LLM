'''Goblets''' and '''chalices''' were drinking vessels that could be simple stemmed [[cup]]s or [[mug]]s, or heavily ornamented devices suited to ceremonial occasions. They were most often used for imbibing fine beverages such as [[wine]]s and [[cordial]]s.

==Description==
These vessels often had long stems, and more elaborate ones were given handles and decorations. They could be made of wildly varying materials, like [[glass]], [[crystal glass]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], or [[wood]], dependent on their prestige.
