Goblets and chalices were drinking vessels that could be simple stemmed cups or mugs, or heavily ornamented devices suited to ceremonial occasions. They were most often used for imbibing fine beverages such as wines and cordials.
These vessels often had long stems, and more elaborate ones were given handles and decorations. They could be made of wildly varying materials, like glass, crystal glass, gold, silver, bronze, or wood, dependent on their prestige.
