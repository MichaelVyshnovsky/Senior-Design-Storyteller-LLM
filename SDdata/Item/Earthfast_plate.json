        "mainbody": "'''Earthfast plate''' was a type of [[full plate]] [[armor]] forged by the [[shield dwarf|shield dwarves]] of [[Earthfast]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] of [[north Faerûn]]. It was famous for its non-magical strength.",
        "Construction": "Earthfast plate armor was a full plate armor of great strength, equivalent to ''full plate +2'' but without being magical. It was said to be as good as the work of the legendary lost [[Clan Ironstar]]. For this, it was extraordinarily expensive.",
        "History": "Most suits of Earthfast armor were, naturally, designed for dwarves. Although the Earthfast dwarves could once be commissioned to make their armor for outsiders, they stopped when their city fell under constant siege from [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s. They had barely enough time to make and maintain their own, let own forge new sets for others. Thus, the few suits sized for non-dwarves were usually well-guarded treasures of wealthy families, in [[Amn]], [[Sembia]], [[Waterdeep]] and other places.\n\nAfter Princess [[Alusair Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]] fought alongside the Earthfast dwarves in [[1359 DR|the Year of the Serpent, 1359 DR]], they made her a suit of Earthfast plate armor made of finest [[mithril]] steel. [[Ironlord]] [[Torg mac Cei]] nicknamed her \"the Mithril Princess\".\n\nDuring the [[Horde Wars]] of [[1360 DR|the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], the 2000 Earthfast dwarven pikemen of the [[Army of the Alliance]] wore their full plate armor, untested against [[Tuigan]] [[arrow]]s. During the [[First Battle of the Golden Way]], the Earthfast armor proved effective, with Tuigan arrows simply bouncing off where they did not strike exposed joints or open visors."
