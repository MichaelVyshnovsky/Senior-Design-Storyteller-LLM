'''Fishcakes''' were a type of handfood found in [[Faer√ªn]].

{{quote|''Too Much [[Haddock]]? Make Fish Cakes!''|A headline from ''[[Baldur's Mouth]] Gazetteer''}}

==Description==
Fishcakes were [[human]]-hand-shaped foods made of chopped, sauced, mixed, and breaded [[fish]], shaped into rounds and lightly fried. Occasionally, other creatures ended up added to the fishcake mix, including [[turtle]], [[crab]], [[squid]]. Any rumors of [[rat]]s and [[cat]]s ending up as fried handfoods were always denied.

==Availability==
Fishcakes of good quality were made in the [[Fish Tails]] seafood factory of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the [[Vast]]. [[Waterdeep]]'s docks had street vendors selling ever-popular fishcakes to hungry sailors. In the [[Elfsong Tavern]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], fishcakes could be found in the kittens alongside [[crab cake]]s, [[cheese]] and [[potato soup]], and [[loaf pudding]]s.
