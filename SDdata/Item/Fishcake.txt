Fishcakes were a type of handfood found in Faer√ªn.
Fishcakes were human-hand-shaped foods made of chopped, sauced, mixed, and breaded fish, shaped into rounds and lightly fried. Occasionally, other creatures ended up added to the fishcake mix, including turtle, crab, squid. Any rumors of rats and cats ending up as fried handfoods were always denied.
Fishcakes of good quality were made in the Fish Tails seafood factory of Ravens Bluff in the Vast. Waterdeeps docks had street vendors selling ever-popular fishcakes to hungry sailors. In the Elfsong Tavern of Baldurs Gate, fishcakes could be found in the kittens alongside crab cakes, cheese and potato soup, and loaf puddings.
