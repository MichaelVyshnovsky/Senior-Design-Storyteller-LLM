        "Description": "It consisted of approximately four to six short iron bars interconnected by multiple links of chain, {{SIrange|4|6|ft|long=yes}} in length. The weapon's origins were traced back to the [[three-section staff|agricultural flail]]. When wielded skillfully, it possessed the potential to be a formidable weapon, as the iron bars can encircle [[shield]]s, delivering powerful and crushing strikes."
