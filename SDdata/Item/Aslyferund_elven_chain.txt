'''''Aslyferund elven chain''''' were sets of [[enchanted]] [[elf|elven]] [[chainmail]] crafted by [[Aslyferund]] of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Description==
These chain mails, suits of finest mesh, were soft and light, weighting and feeling like regular clothes rather than heavy metal links.

==Powers==
These masterfully-crafted suits of chainmail were enhanced with ''+3 enchantment'' and allowed for the armor to soak part of the damage, further protecting the wearer. Due to the creation process of the ''Aslyferund elven chains'', they could only we worn by creatures of elven blood.

==History==
These enchanted items were crafted by [[Aslyferund]], one of the most famous armorers of Myth Drannor, before the city's fall in the [[Weeping War]] of [[714 DR]]. Many sages entertained rumors that the more powerful sets of ''Aslyferund elven chain'' were created with the aid of a [[gold dragon]]. 

By late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some of these sets of armor could be found in the [[Sword Coast North]] region,
