        "mainbody": "'''''Artoth's Bane''''' was a magical [[battleaxe]] that belonged to a [[dwarf|dwarven]] architect [[Artoth Frayhammer]] who was buried with honors long before the [[Weeping War]]'s advent, in the [[Elven Catacombs]] under [[Castle Cormanthor]] in [[Myth Drannor]] and guarded by [[iron golem|dwarven statue golems]].",
        "Description": "''Artoth's Bane'' was named after its owner. The axe was of elven design, heavily used, combat-damaged, and blunted.",
        "Powers": "Even though blunt, ''Artoth's Bane'' was still a powerful enchanted weapon. Its enchantments were so strong that even though it dealt crushing damage due to being blunt (instead of cleaving), it was still magically enhanced. Additionally, the ''Bane'' held magics that allowed the user to stop their opponents once a day akin to the ''[[hold person]]'' spell.",
        "History": "''Artoth's Bane'' along with Artoth himself were long dead and entombed by the time Myth Drannor fell in the Weeping War. Even though the catacombs where his tomb was located were regularly raided by [[drow]], [[orc]]s, [[orog]]s, and the [[Cult of the Dragon]], in [[1369 DR]], ''Artoth's Bane'' was still with its master. Along with a few other tombs of heroes in the depths of the Elven Catacombs, Artoth's final resting place had the ''Receiver of Respect''. It was designed to release the legendary weapon in exchange for another mundane [[battleaxe]] in times of dire need."
