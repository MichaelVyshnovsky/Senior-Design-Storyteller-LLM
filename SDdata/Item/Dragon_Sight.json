        "mainbody": "'''''Dragon Sight''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] that granted the wearer a temporary simulacrum of a [[dragon]]'s magic sight.",
        "Description": "The helmet's main feature was a small dragon skull attached to its top, giving it a fearsome appearance. Each of the skull's eye sockets held a menacingly glowing [[gemstone]].",
        "Powers": "The wearer could tap into the helmet's magic to cast the ''[[see invisibility]]'' [[spell]] once per day. However, ''Dragon Sight's'' menacing appearance made it harder for the wearer to appear likable and personable.",
        "History": "''Dragon Sight'' was among many exotic magical items that belonged to [[Bashshar al Rachid]], a famous collector and merchant, and the wealthiest [[djinni]] on [[Toril]] as of the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The djinni was confined to the ''avarine decanter'' that was in possession of a shifty [[drow]] merchant, [[Nym (Icewind Dale)|Nym]] of [[Icewind Dale]]."
