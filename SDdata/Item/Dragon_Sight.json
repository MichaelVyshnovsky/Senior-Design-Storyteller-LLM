        "mainbody": "Dragon Sight was an enchanted helmet that granted the wearer a temporary simulacrum of a dragons magic sight.\nThe helmets main feature was a small dragon skull attached to its top, giving it a fearsome appearance. Each of the skulls eye sockets held a menacingly glowing gemstone.\nThe wearer could tap into the helmets magic to cast the see invisibility spell once per day. However, Dragon Sights menacing appearance made it harder for the wearer to appear likable and personable.\nDragon Sight was among many exotic magical items that belonged to Bashshar al Rachid, a famous collector and merchant, and the wealthiest djinni on Toril as of the early 14 century DR. The djinni was confined to the avarine decanter that was in possession of a shifty drow merchant, Nym of Icewind Dale."
