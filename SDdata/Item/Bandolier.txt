Bandoliers, also known as bandoleers or baldrics, were a type of belt in the Realms that one wore diagonally, slung around the body from one shoulder to the opposite hip. They were used to carry a variety of items, such as weapons, instruments, and even pouches. They were also used to hold up garments and hang sheathes or scabbards.
Functional bandoliers were typically made of leather and had nothing more than a buckle, for ease of use and practicality. Though more decorative varieties could be found made of fashionable materials such as brocade or silk. They also typically were decorated with bells or tassels along their bottom edge, as well as other adornments.
