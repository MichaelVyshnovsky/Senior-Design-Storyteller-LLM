        "mainbody": "A rod of withering was a powerful magical rod that weakened those struck by it.\nThe rod bore a resemblance to an enchanted mace, and could be wielded as such.\nWhen the rod struck an opponent, it did not inflict physical injuries, but instead sapped the targets strength and stamina if they lacked the fortitude to withstand the magic. Armor did not protect against this magic, and a powerful direct hit could leave the target permanently weakened."
