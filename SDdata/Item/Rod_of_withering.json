        "mainbody": "A '''''rod of withering''''' was a powerful [[magic]]al [[rod]] that weakened those struck by it.",
        "Description": "The ''rod'' bore a resemblance to an enchanted [[mace]], and could be wielded as such.",
        "Powers": "When the ''rod'' struck an opponent, it did not inflict physical injuries, but instead sapped the target's strength and stamina if they lacked the fortitude to withstand the magic. Armor did not protect against this magic, and a powerful direct hit could leave the target permanently weakened."
