        "Description": "It was a small glossy stone bearing a complex sigil.",
        "Crafting": "A ''blackstone rune'' was carved by a spellcaster who knew the ''[[plane shift]]'' spell and the art of crafting wondrous items.",
        "Powers": "The token allowed its bearer to travel from the Material Plane to the Plane of Shadow, or the reverse, as with a ''plane shift'' spell. They could take only 50 pounds (22.7 kilograms) of possessions with them. It functioned only three times.",
        "Users": "Shadar-kai weakened by their shadow curse used ''blackstone runes'' to take respite in the Plane of Shadow."
