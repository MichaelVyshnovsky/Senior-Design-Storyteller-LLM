        "Powers": "The sashes' enchantments slightly boosted the wearers' mental and physical attributes. When the wearer used other items of the set, their mental and physical prowess was boosted even further and granted the wearer limited protection from all damage.",
        "History": "''Scarves of embellishments'' were first in use in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]], after the crisis in which [[Tiamat]] and the [[Cult of the Dragon]] menaced the [[Sword Coast]]."
