        "mainbody": "ashes of embellishments were legendary artifacts, designed to be worn with a scarf of embellishments and one of the enchanted storytellers journals.\nThe sashes enchantments slightly boosted the wearers mental and physical attributes. When the wearer used other items of the set, their mental and physical prowess was boosted even further and granted the wearer limited protection from all damage.\nScarves of embellishments were first in use in the late 15 century DR in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North, after the crisis in which Tiamat and the Cult of the Dragon menaced the Sword Coast."
