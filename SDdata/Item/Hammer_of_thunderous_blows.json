        "mainbody": "Hammer of thunderous blows was a powerful enchanted maul created sometime before the late 15 century DR and broken apart in later years.\nHammers of thunderous blows were crafted out of high-quality steel and polished to shine and reflect like the finest of mirrors.\nA hammer of thunderous blows possessed a potent +3 enchantment that made the bludgeon much more deadly and guided it toward the target. Each weapons swing was as powerful as a thunderclap and had a chance of knocking its targets prone.\nWhen the first of these weapons was first created was unknown. However, one hammer of thunderous blows might have been reforged by a master smith of Luskan in the late 15 century DR, for a low fee of 8,000 gp, using a magic ominous gem, discovered in the Forlorn Cliffs of the Underdark an ancient broken shaft and its broken hammer head, found in the duergar city of Grackslugh."
