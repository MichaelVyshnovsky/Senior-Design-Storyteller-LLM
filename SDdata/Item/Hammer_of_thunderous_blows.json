        "mainbody": "'''''Hammer of thunderous blows''''' was a powerful [[enchanted]] [[maul]] created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] and broken apart in later years.",
        "Description": "''Hammers of thunderous blows'' were crafted out of high-quality [[steel]] and polished to shine and reflect like the finest of [[mirror]]s.",
        "Powers": "A ''hammer of thunderous blows'' possessed a potent ''+3'' enchantment that made the bludgeon much more deadly and guided it toward the target. Each weapon's swing was as powerful as a thunderclap and had a chance of knocking its targets prone.",
        "History": "When the first of these weapons was first created was unknown. However, one ''hammer of thunderous blows'' might have been reforged by a master smith of [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, for a low fee of 8,000 [[gp]], using a magic ''ominous gem'', discovered in the [[Forlorn Cliffs]] of the [[Underdark]]; an ancient broken shaft; and its broken hammer head, found in the [[duergar]] city of [[Grackslugh]]."
