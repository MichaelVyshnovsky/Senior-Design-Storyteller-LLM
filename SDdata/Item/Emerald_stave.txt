The '''''emerald stave''''' was an [[enchanted]] artifact [[staff]] that once belonged to a [[yuan-ti]] [[Zehirite]] cultist [[Il'Foss]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The staff resembled a wearing sinuous snake.

==Powers==
This powerful artifact held a portion of Il'Foss's dark powers and because of that foul influence, only creatures who venerated evil could wield the ''emerald stave''. Those who managed to tap into the weapon's magic received a boon of increased intelligence. The staff also allowed the wielder to ''[[create undead]]'' once per day and afflict a creature with ''[[crushing despair]]'' once a day.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, yuan-ti who followed an interloper deity [[Zehir]] revealed their sinister intents for the [[Sword Coast]]. The yuan-ti [[House Se'Sehen]] began attacking the operations of [[House Sauringar]] and their [[Mercantile House]] trading organization led by [[Sa'Sani]]. An attempt on her life took place in the [[Red Sheaf Inn]], a roadside inn east of the city of [[Neverwinter]]. The attack was led by a cultist mage [[Il'Foss]] who wielded the ''emerald stave''. With the yuan-ti cultist's likely dead, the staff changed hands. Il'Foss's powers still clang to the weapon even after leaving his possessions.
