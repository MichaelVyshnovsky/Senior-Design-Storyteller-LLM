        "mainbody": "'''''Deathbane''''' was a sacred enchanted [[staff]] of powerful healing magic that belonged to a blind [[moon elf]] [[cleric]] of [[Mystra]] named [[Beriand]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].",
        "Description": "''Deathbane'' was a beautiful ornate staff laced with intricate runes written by a delicate elven hand. The staff's name ''Deathbane'' was written on it in the same graceful manner. The staff felt warm to the touch.",
        "Powers": "''Deathbane'' did not possess any offensive powers; it was a healer's tool. The user of ''Deathbane'' could cast an extremely powerful version of the ''[[heal]]'' spell.",
        "History": "In 1369 DR, ''Deathbane'' was in Beriand's possession when he ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor, along with many other adventurers, following [[Elminster]]'s call for aid against the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that planned to use the ruins' ''[[mythal]]s'' and the ''Pools of Radiance'' to conquer the region. Beriand's group was ambushed by [[orcs]] and though he was dragged to safety by [[Faeril]], the ''Deathbane'' staff was lost to the attackers.\n\nBeriand requested aid from another group of adventurers from [[Phlan]] that arrived late to the scene. They managed to recover the staff from the [[Dwarven Dungeons]] under [[Myth Drannor]] and return it to the blind cleric."
