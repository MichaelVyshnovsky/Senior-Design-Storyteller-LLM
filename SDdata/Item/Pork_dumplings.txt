Pork dumplings, or house dumplings, was one of the popular specialty dishes served at the ramshackle Owlroost Head Inn of the Amnian town of Purskul as of the late 14 century DR.
House dumplings were made using minced pork. The stuffing was wrapped in dough and fried until crispy on the outside and filled with piping hot juices on the inside. Guests of the Owlroost Head Inn were recommended to purchase wines alongside the dish to cool down mouths of guests who bit into hot pork dumplings.
