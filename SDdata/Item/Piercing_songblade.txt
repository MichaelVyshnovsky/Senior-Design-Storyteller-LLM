A '''''piercing songblade''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[sword]] meant to be wielded by a [[bard]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|32}}

==Description==
Any heavy or light [[blade]] could be enchanted to become a ''piercing songblade''. Such a blade was silent when wielded, but released a piercing musical note upon striking a target.

==Powers==
Like other ''[[songblade]]s'', ''piercing songblades'' were magically sharp and strong weapons that could be used as an [[implement]] for bardic [[spell]]casting.

When wielded by a bard, the piercing note released by the blade could literally pierce and rend an opponent's [[armor]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Zaol]], a fallen [[angel of vengeance]] who dual-wielded a ''piercing songblade'' [[longsword]] and an ''[[aegis blade]]''.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bitter Frost|23}}
