A piercing songblade was an enchanted sword meant to be wielded by a bard.
Any heavy or light blade could be enchanted to become a piercing songblade. Such a blade was silent when wielded, but released a piercing musical note upon striking a target.
Like other songblades, piercing songblades were magically sharp and strong weapons that could be used as an implement for bardic spellcasting.
When wielded by a bard, the piercing note released by the blade could literally pierce and rend an opponents armor.
* Zaol, a fallen angel of vengeance who dual-wielded a piercing songblade longsword and an aegis blade.
