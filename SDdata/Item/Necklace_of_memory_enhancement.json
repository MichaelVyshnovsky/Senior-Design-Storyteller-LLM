        "mainbody": "A necklace of memory enhancement was a magical amulet that greatly improved the wearers powers of recall.\nIt was fashioned from brass.\nThe wearer became immune to all forms of memory loss, whether due to magical or natural causes, like a forget spell. Furthermore, they gained an eidetic memory, being able to perfectly recall any event witnessed, any conversation heard, or any book read up to seven days previously, though beyond this time their memory was as normal. Moreover, they had to have been wearing the necklace of memory enhancement at the time.\nIt had no impact on how a wizard memorized spells or forgot them after casting.\nAdzerak, a lich and bibliophile devotee of Deneir, kept a necklace of memory enhancement on a hook in his nightstand in his lair in Cormyr around 1367 DR.\nThe curators of the Hall of Maps at the House of the Moon in Waterdeep, already possessing excellent memories, shared a necklace of memory enhancement to find specific maps in the unlabeled scroll tubes.\nAn unidentified woman in Ravens Bluff wore a necklace of memory enhancement, which was a family heirloom, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She may have given it as a reward to an adventurer who saved her 5-year-old daughter from drowning."
