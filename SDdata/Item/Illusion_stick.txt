'''''Illusion sticks''''' were magic [[rod]]s, simple in appearance, charged with ''[[illusion]]'' magics.

==Powers==
An ''illusion stick'' possessed twenty charges and could disperse two [[spell]]s on command: the ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'' spell consumed three charges per casting, and ''[[mirror image]]'' â€“ a single charge.

==History==
In the years that followed the [[Shadow War]], after the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''illusion sticks'' were sold at the [[Thayan enclave (Neverwinter)|Thayan enclave]] in [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Tyr's Eye]] plaza, by a well-trained Thayan [[gnoll]]..
