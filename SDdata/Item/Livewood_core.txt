The '''''livewood core''''' was a magical device similar to an [[Eberron]]nian [[warforged]] [[docent]], recovered from [[Thorn Hollow]] in the [[King's Forest]] in the mid-1480s [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|This sphere of living wood pulses with vital energy. When inserted into the body of a Warforged, vines and tendrils will emerge from it, spreading leaves and moss across the wearer.
}}
==Powers==
The ''livewood core'' provided wide-ranging protection and fortification against most threats. It caused vines, bark, and moss to grow over the warforged body and add a layer of magical defenses.

==History==
The core was found in the Thorn Hollow caverns of [[Thorngap]], at a time that the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]] had taken over and corrupted nature into being his tool.
