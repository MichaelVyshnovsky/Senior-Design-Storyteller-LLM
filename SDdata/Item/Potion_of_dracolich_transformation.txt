'''''Potions of dracolich transformation''''' were magical [[potion]]s consumed by [[dragon]]s as a part of the process of becoming [[undead]] [[dracolich]]es, created by the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Description==
''Potions of dracolich transformation'' were an integral part of the process to transform a living wyrm into a dracolich. The exact composition of each position varied and was prepared for each individual dragon separately using a wide selection of ingredients, depending on the age and type of the dragon. All variants, however, were brewed using seven arcane ingredients that included [[vampire blood]],

==Powers==
The potion was imbibed after the future dracolich's [[phylactery]] prepared. This concoction was [[poison]]ous to any other creatures but dragons. The lethality of the potion was severe, making survival extremely unlikely.

==Creation==
In order to prepare a serving of this potion, a spellcaster needed to assemble all the required ingredients and use the ''[[animate dead]]'' spell.

==History==
This potion was used in turning [[Pelendralaar]] into his undead form sometime before [[1369 DR]]. During the Cult of the Dragon's occupation of the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], [[Kya Mordrayn]]'s lieutenants prepared another serving of the potion, presumably to transform Pelendralaar's daughter [[Palasiraks]] at a later date.
