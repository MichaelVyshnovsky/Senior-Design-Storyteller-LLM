The '''''deathstalker mantle''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[cloak]] worn by the [[deathstalker]]s of [[Bhaal]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
{{quote|''Let hill and hollow be a door''<br/>''To screams that last forevermore.''}}

==Powers==
The cloak's magic turned the wearer ''[[invisible]]'' after a kill. This power was activated automatically, once per six seconds, and the ''invisibility'' lasted for 12 seconds.

==Notable Owners==
*[[Dark Urge]], a [[Bhaalspawn]] of the late 15{{th}} century DR. The mantle was entrusted to [[Sceleritas Fel]], the Dark Urge's attendant in [[1492 DR]].
