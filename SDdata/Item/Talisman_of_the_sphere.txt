A talisman of the sphere was an enchanted piece of jewelry that made it easier for a spellcaster to control a sphere of annihilation.
These small adamantine loops had a small handle.
These items were not only useless to non-wizards, the would actually cause physical harm to any non-wizard who held them. When held by a wizard concentrating on controlling a sphere of annhilation, a talisman of the sphere increased the wizards chance of success. However, if the wizard was unable to gain control over the sphere of annhilation, it would proceed to move toward the wizard at its maximum speed. A wand of negation targeted at a talisman of the sphere would negate the control.
