Corpse rose was a grim plant that flowered where the dead rested. Some of these flowers were found in the Western Heartlands and in the graveyard of the Shadow-cursed Lands.
Corpse roses were long-petaled flowers that grew and bloomed in the recently deads bodies.
Corpse roses were a valuable and extremely rare alchemical ingredient. These flowers were dried and ground along with salts that enchanted their properties. Salts of corpse roses could be mixed with certain types of alchemical suspensions to brew a powerful poison called Thisobalds brewed-up Bellyglummer.
