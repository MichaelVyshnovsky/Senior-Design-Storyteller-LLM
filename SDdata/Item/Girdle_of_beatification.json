        "History": "At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the ''girdle of beatification'' was gifted to Thom Wainwright by the clergy of Helm as a reward for allegedly destroying the [[Unseeing Eye‎‎]] and its [[Blinded Acolytes]] in Berdusk. Thom went on performing many other heroic deeds for the church until falling into debt later in life. The ''girdle of beatification'' was sold off to a renowned cleric [[Mask]].\n\nBy 1312 DR, the enchanted belt found its way into hands of [[Elytharra Dinnesmore]], an [[enchantress]] and wife of Speaker [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]] of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]]."
