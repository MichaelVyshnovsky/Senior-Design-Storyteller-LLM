Its mountainous poise enchantment allowed the monk receive effects of the blade ward spell when they used the patient defense technique. The breezeswift speed enchantment allowed the monk to briefly boost their protection and attack after using the step of the wind technique. Once the monk used the step of the wind technique, their defense received a magical boost similar to that of a +1 enchantment and their blows were guided to the targets, dealing additional force damage.\nOnce, long before the late 15 century DR, the Garb of the Land and Sky was worn by Kushigo, a warrior who gave up his heavy shell for the freedom of movement after suffering a great loss. In the , the Garb of the Land and Sky could be found in Danthelons Dancing Axes inventory, among mostly mundane items in stock."
