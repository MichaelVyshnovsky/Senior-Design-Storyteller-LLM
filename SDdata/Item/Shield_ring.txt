The shield ring was a highly sought-after enchanted ring that protected its wearer from harm and magic missiles.
The shield ring was a simple band carved out of jade.
The shield ring improved the wearers defense, significantly improved their protection against ranged weapons and various missiles, as well as provided them with complete immunity against the magic missile spell.
This enchanted jade ring was created by a wizard of some repute known as Bil, who also penned such spells of sardonic nature as Bils fantastic ale and Bils blasting ball. The wizard often got into scuffles with other spellcasters and found his simple ring to be very helpful. Sometime around 1261 DR, all records of Bil indicated his disappearance from the Realms, and his shield ring was among items he had left behind. However, most of Bils friends were individuals of ill repute and likely pwned the ring as soon as they got their hands on it.
By 1281 DR, Bils shield ring found its way into the lair of yuan-ti marauders in the Dragons Eye of the Spine of the World.
