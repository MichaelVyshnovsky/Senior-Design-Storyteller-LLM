The '''''shield ring''''' was a highly sought-after enchanted [[ring]] that protected its wearer from harm and ''[[magic missile]]s''.

==Description==
The ''shield ring'' was a simple band carved out of [[jade]].

==Powers==
The ''shield ring'' improved the wearer's defense, significantly improved their protection against ranged weapons and various missiles, as well as provided them with complete immunity against the ''magic missile'' spell.

==History==
This enchanted jade ring was created by a [[wizard]] of some repute known as [[Bil]], who also penned such spells of sardonic nature as ''[[Bil's fantastic ale]]'' and ''[[Bil's blasting ball]]''. The wizard often got into scuffles with other spellcasters and found his simple ring to be very helpful. Sometime around [[1261 DR]], all records of Bil indicated his disappearance from the Realms, and his ''shield ring'' was among items he had left behind. However, most of Bil's friends were individuals of ill repute and likely pwned the ring as soon as they got their hands on it.

By [[1281 DR]], Bil's ''shield ring'' found its way into the lair of [[yuan-ti]] marauders in the [[Dragon's Eye]] of the [[Spine of the World]].
