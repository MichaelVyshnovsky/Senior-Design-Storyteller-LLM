The '''''seal of guidance''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] token crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Saarvin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
It was a [[silver]] chip into which Saarvin had carved a notch to commemorate each of his daring hunts into and beyond the [[Spine of the World]].

==Powers==
The [[magic]] of the ''seal of guidance'' could be used to draw the attention of Saarvin's enemies, which he could use to his advantage.

==Notable Owners==
* Saarvin , a [[dragonborn]] [[ranger]] and [[scout]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[axes of the slicing storm]]''.
