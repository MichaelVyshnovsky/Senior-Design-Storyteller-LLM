        "mainbody": "wand of frost was a wand that could fire a variety of cold-based arcane spells.\nWands of frosts expelled magical cold energy, in the form of ice storms, cones of cold, and walls of ice. The wands had limited charges, and would use up one per spell cast, except for when a cone of cold was cast, in which case they used up two charges. It was possible to recharge these wands.\nFrost salamander bones could be used to form parts of wands of frost.\nSome variations of wands of frosts could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor. Wands of cone of cold (that were able to cast the cone of cold spell) and wands of cold (casting chill touch) appeared to be unmelting enchanted icicles.\n* Adnan al-Raqi, a Zakharan shair.\n* Corellon Larethian, Creator of the Elves, owned such a wand, but it had infinite charges.\n* Geb, an ormyrr who lived in the ruins of Myth Drannor.\n* Ignar Turc Abolin, a lich from Kara-Tur.\n* Xithiss, a mindflayer who worked for Baeloth Barrityl in his coliseum the Black Pits."
