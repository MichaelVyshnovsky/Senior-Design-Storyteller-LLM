        "mainbody": "A '''wand of frost''' was a [[wand]] that could fire a variety of cold-based [[arcane]] [[spell]]s.",
        "Description": "''Wands of frosts'' expelled magical cold energy, in the form of ''[[ice storm]]s'', ''[[cone of cold|cones of cold]]'', and ''[[wall of ice|walls of ice]]''. The wands had limited charges, and would use up one per spell cast, except for when a ''cone of cold'' was cast, in which case they used up two charges. It was possible to recharge these wands.\n\n[[Frost salamander]] bones could be used to form parts of ''wands of frost''.\n\nSome variations of ''wands of frosts'' could be found in the ruins of Myth Drannor. ''Wands of cone of cold'' (that were able to cast the ''[[cone of cold]]'' spell) and ''wands of cold'' (casting ''[[chill touch]]'') appeared to be unmelting enchanted icicles.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Adnan al-Raqi]], a [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] [[sha'ir]].\n* [[Corellon Larethian]], Creator of the [[Elves]], owned such a wand, but it had infinite charges.\n* [[Geb (ormyrr)|Geb]], an [[ormyrr]] who lived in the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].\n* [[Ignar Turc Abolin]], a [[lich]] from [[Kara-Tur]].\n* [[Xithiss]], a [[mindflayer]] who worked for [[Baeloth Barrityl]] in his coliseum the [[Black Pits]]."
