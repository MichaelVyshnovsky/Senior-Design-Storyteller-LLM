        "mainbody": "The '''''whispering masks''''' were a collection of [[magic]]al [[wood]]en masks used by the [[hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] to control the guardians of her inner sanctum.",
        "Description": "The wearer of the mask was bombarded with incomprehensible whispers and a putrid stench that overwhelmed their senses and thoughts, forcing them under Ethel's control. While this effect could be resisted for a time, it took a strong sense of willpower.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Ethel had enthralled four individuals into her flock by means of the ''whispering masks'', naming them the [[Mask of Regret|Masks of Regret]], [[Mask of Servitude|Servitude]], [[Mask of Terror|Terror]], and [[Mask of Vengeance|Vengeance]]."
