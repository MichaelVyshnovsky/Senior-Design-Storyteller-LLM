        "mainbody": "oftshield was an ointment that helped prevent contracting a disease.The source does not indicate that the infection has to come from a wound, so it may be possible that this concoction was effective on airborne diseases such as featherlung.\nSoftshield was thick paste with a strong odor made by the sorceress and alchemist Angrath Dree from herbs and saps found in northwest Faer√ªn. It could be purchased from her at Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch, or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a jar of ointment was 10 gp.\nIf applied to the skin within ten minutes, softshield slightly improved the chance of resisting disease. After ten minutes, there was no benefit."
