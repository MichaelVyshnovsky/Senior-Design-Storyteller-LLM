        "mainbody": "'''Softshield''' was an ointment that helped prevent contracting a disease.{{Cite dragon/300/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Old Angrath's Smokehouse|85}}<ref group=\"note\">The source does not indicate that the infection has to come from a wound, so it may be possible that this concoction was effective on airborne diseases such as [[featherlung]].",
        "Description": "Softshield was thick paste with a strong odor made by the [[sorceress]] and [[alchemist]] [[Angrath Dree]] from [[herb]]s and saps found in [[northwest Faerûn]]. It could be purchased from her at [[Old Angrath's Smokehouse]] in [[Red Larch]], or possibly from secondary vendors elsewhere. The usual price for a jar of ointment was 10 [[gp]].",
        "Powers": "If applied to the skin within ten minutes, softshield slightly improved the chance of resisting disease. After ten minutes, there was no benefit."
