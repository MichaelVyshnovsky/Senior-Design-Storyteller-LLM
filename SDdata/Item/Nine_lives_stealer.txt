A nine lives stealer was a magical sword that had the potential to destroy the life force of a target, killing it instantly.
Swords of any shape and size could be enchanted to become nine lives stealers.
All nine lives stealers were empowered with a base enchantment that considerably increased their accuracy and sharpness. On top of that, if the swords wielder managed to land an extraordinary hit, the sword immediately killed the opponent by obliterating the creatures very life essence. Only constructs, undead, and extremely powerful and resilient beings were immune to this effect. This power could only be used a limited number of times, after which the sword lost this property and only retained its baseline magical enhancement.
