A '''''nine lives stealer''''' was a [[magic item|magical]] [[sword]] that had the potential to destroy the life force of a target, killing it instantly.

==Description==
Swords of any shape and size could be enchanted to become ''nine lives stealers''.

==Powers==
All ''nine lives stealers'' were empowered with a base enchantment that considerably increased their accuracy and sharpness. On top of that, if the sword's wielder managed to land an extraordinary hit, the sword immediately killed the opponent by obliterating the creature's very life essence. Only [[construct]]s, [[undead]], and extremely powerful and resilient beings were immune to this effect. This power could only be used a limited number of times, after which the sword lost this property and only retained its baseline magical enhancement.

==Notable Owners==
* The [[death knight]] [[Zalthar]], who inhabited the [[Shadowdusk Hold]] level of [[Undermountain]], owned a ''nine lives stealer''.
* The [[death knight]] [[Queylar Karrault]], in the service of [[Szass Tam]], wielded a ''nine lives stealer'' called [[Hunter (stealer)|Hunter]].
* [[Gormstadd|Gormstadd the Rerisen]] owned a ''nine lives stealer''.
