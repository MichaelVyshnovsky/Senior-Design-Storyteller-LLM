        "mainbody": "Oil of elemental invulnerability was a type of magical oil that would provide complete protection against one of four elements, coming in air, earth, fire and water varieties.\nThose who applied this substance to their body would become completely invulnerable to harm from the mundane forces of the associated element—such as floods, earth slides, wind storms, and so on—for a period of one day. This oil did not protect against harm afflicted by elementals. This effect primarily applied to the Prime Material plane, though a few instances of these oils were also effective on the Inner Planes. Each bottle of oil of elemental invulnerability contained eight applications of this substance, enough to cover one human-sized creature for eight days or eight individuals for one day.\n* These were among the magical items commonly used by planewalkers and could be purchased in the markets of Sigil at prices lower than those on the Prime Material.\n* Husam ibn Aasim al-Zalim, a Zakharan fire mage, carried an oil of water elemental invulnerability.\nSome magical oils were outwardly mistaken for being oils of elemental invulnerability. This included oil of fumbling and oil of sulphur."
