The '''''Jolty Vest''''' was an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of [[chainmail]] created by the eccentric [[gnome]] inventor, [[Yrre|Yrre the Sparkstruck]].

==Powers==
Many of Yrre's inventions, whether they be armor or weapons, allowed individuals to build up an electrical charge within their body. If the wearer of the ''Jolty Best'' had built up this charge, they became more dangerous to any nearby foe. Anyone striking the wearer would be shocked with an electric blast.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the suit of armor remained in the possession of [[Brem]], a [[Zhentarim]] merchant.
