'''''Griswald's belt''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[belt]] that once belonged to the famous knight of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Grisbane the Great]].

==Powers==
The belt's magics boosted the wearer's strength and improved their fortitude. Additionally, ''Griswald's belt'' allowed the wearer to cast the ''[[true strike]]'' spell once per day.

==History==
Even though ''Griswald's belt'' bore the name of Sir [[Griswald]], a 14{{th}} century [[DR]] noble knight of Baldur's Gate, the belt's original owner was his grandfather â€“ a famous knight named Grisbane the Great, who lived and gained fame for his noble deeds sometime before {{YearlinkName|1372}}. In 1372 DR, Griswald wore his belt to the siege of [[Castle Exeltis]] to the south west [[Daggerford]] trying to rescue his beloved "princess" [[Soliana]]. Sir Griswald was ready to offer the precious belt as the reward for aid in infiltration of the impregnable cliffside castle.
