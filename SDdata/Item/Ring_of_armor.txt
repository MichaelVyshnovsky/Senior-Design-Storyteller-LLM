A '''''ring of armor''''' was a [[magic]] [[ring]] that protected its wearer from physical harm.

==Powers==
These rings came in three varietiesâ€”a ''ring of light armor'', ''ring of medium armor'', and ''ring of heavy armor''. The amount of protection provided to the wearer by such rings increased from the "light" version to the "heavy" version.
