A whip of constricting was a +2 magical whip that had the ability to entangle and constrict any creatures it struck. 
Whenever a blow was landed with this whip, they could forego its use and entangle their opponent, hampering their movement, actions and spellcasting abilities. Any entangled person or creature could attempt to break free. Also, once per day, the wielder of a whip of constricting could command the whip to constrict any person that had been entangled, damaging them as they struggled with the whip. 
These whips were created with the use of the animate rope and bigbys crushing hand spells.
