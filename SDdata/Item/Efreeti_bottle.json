        "mainbody": "An '''''efreeti bottle''''' was a powerful magical item in which an [[efreeti]] was entrapped. It was thus a variety of [[genie prison]].<ref>",
        "Description": "''Efreeti bottles'' were usually crafted from [[brass]] or [[bronze]] and had a stopper made of [[lead]] and marked with mystical seals. Very often, the stopper did not prevent steam or smoke from escaping constantly from the heat of the efreeti trapped within. The bottle weighed about a {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}.\n\nEfreeti bottles emitted a strong [[conjuration]] [[aura]] that could be detected by the proper magics.\n\nIn most lands, an ''efreeti bottle'' might sell for the exorbitant price of 145,000 [[gold piece]]s. ''efreeti bottles'' were still common enough in [[Calimshan]] that one could find them there for ten percent of that cost.",
        "Powers": "An ''efreeti bottle'' could only be opened once per day. When opened, the fire [[genie]] within was temporarily released and was compelled to serve his or her master completely for up to ten minutes before returning to the prison of the bottle.\n\nUse of the bottle by an owner could be dangerous, however, because the time trapped in a bottle in solitary confinement could drive an efreeti insane. Roughly one in ten times that an ''efreeti bottle'' was opened, the efreeti would instead attack his or her master and seek to escape.\n\nIt was equally likely for efreet so summoned to offer three ''[[wish]]es'' in exchange for their freedom.",
        "Creation": "Only a very powerful spellcaster could fashion an ''efreeti bottle'', and the caster had to know how to [[summon monster]]s in order to call forth an efreeti to entrap.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Gorar al-Aksar]], a famous [[Zakhara]]n [[barber]] of [[Huzuz]]."
