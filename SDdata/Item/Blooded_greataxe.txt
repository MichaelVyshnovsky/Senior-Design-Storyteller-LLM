The blooded greataxe was a minor enchanted axe from the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands.
The weapon was covered in brown caked blood from its countless victims, emitting a potent stench of iron.
The blooded greataxe was enchanted to become more deadly, the closer its wielder was to death.
This grim-looking axe was once wielded by a notorious and deranged killer whose deeds were so grim that their name was magically removed from everyones memories and records. By the late 15 century DR, the weapon. found its way into the hands of blacksmith Dammon of Elturel.
* Dammon, a tiefling smith from the city of Elturel who found shelter in the Emerald Grove in the late 15 century DR.
