The axes head was silver-plated.\nThe weapon carried a simple +2 enchantment, however, when wielded against orcs and orogs, it became functionally an enchanted +3 axe. Additionally, when battling orcs and orogs, the hatchet magically improved the wielders defenses, similarly to a +1 enchantment.\nThe axe was created by the dwarven smiths and enchanters of Myth Drannor, before the citys destruction in the Weeping War in 714 DR. By the , the Silverleaf hatchet, along with its sister weapon, the Silverleaf rod, fell into the scaly hands of lizardfolk, led by a mysterious sorcerer named Malgi Hi who laired in tunnels of the Dwarven Dungeons."
