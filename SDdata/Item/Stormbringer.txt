'''''Stormbringer''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[battleaxe]] dedicated to [[Talos]], the Lord of Storms.

==Powers==
The axe was engraved with the words that read "Lord of Storms", a dedication to Talos. However, the engraving bore no magical significance and its ''+1'' enchantment was achieved by some other means. Additionally, the axe dealt magical lightning damage upon successful strike and allowed the wielder to cast the ''[[lightning bolt]]'' ten times.

==History==
''Stormbringer'' was believed to have been crated sometime long before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, however its origins remained unknown. The axe was an arcane artifact caught after by pirate captains for its magics that controlled storms and thunder. In 1374 DR, ''Stormbringer'' found its way to the city of [[Westgate]] and was used by Captain [[Gothos One-Eye]] of the ''[[Dark Dahlia]]'' buccaneer vessel.
