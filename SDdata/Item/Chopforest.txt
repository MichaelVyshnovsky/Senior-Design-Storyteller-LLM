'''Chopforest''' was a salad dish eaten by [[wood elves]] and in [[Amn]].

==Availability==
It was a traditional forest salad of the wood elves.

Chopforest was on the menu at the [[Battlescarred Bard]] inn on the [[Trade Way]] in Amn ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]

==Description==
The Battlescarred version was a mixed green salad with [[cabbage]] and [[brussels sprout]]s, together with wildshoot [[onion]]s and [[mallowfern]] and garnished with [[basil]] and black [[olive]]s, but not so much as to overpower the other flavors.

The Yawning Portal version was similar but instead garnished with black olives, [[fennel]], [[garlic]], and [[pepper]], with a tangy [[vinaigrette]] dressing.
