Chopforest was a salad dish eaten by wood elves and in Amn.
It was a traditional forest salad of the wood elves.
Chopforest was on the menu at the Battlescarred Bard inn on the Trade Way in Amn circa 1369 DR
The Battlescarred version was a mixed green salad with cabbage and brussels sprouts, together with wildshoot onions and mallowfern and garnished with basil and black olives, but not so much as to overpower the other flavors.
The Yawning Portal version was similar but instead garnished with black olives, fennel, garlic, and pepper, with a tangy vinaigrette dressing.
