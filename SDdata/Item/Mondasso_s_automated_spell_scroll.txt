'''''Mondasso's automated spell scrolls''''' were [[enchanted]] [[scroll]]s created by the traveling [[mage]] named [[Mondasso]] sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Mondasso's automated spell scrolls'' appeared as mundane scrolls made of [[vellum]]. These scrolls were blank, apart from a simple letter "M" at the top of the scroll.

==Powers==
''Mondasso's automated spell scrolls'' were among items invented by Mondasso, who spent several decades traveling [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]]. He specialized in magical gizmos that aided and sped up the creation of mages' scrolls. In order to use these scrolls, their owner had to rest for several hours â€“ equal time needed to memorize arcane spells. When the spellcaster awoke, they opened up ''Mondasso's automated spell scroll'' and spread 10 [[gp]] worth of [[ink]] on its surface, after which the magic scroll began to absorb and shape the ink, memorizing the spells directly from the mage's mind. Each ''Mondasso's scroll'' could hold up to twenty unique spells.
