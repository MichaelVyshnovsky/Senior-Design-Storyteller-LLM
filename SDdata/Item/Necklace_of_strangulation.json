        "mainbody": "A necklace of strangulation was a sinister enchanted piece of jewelry whose cursed power was only revealed when placed around the neck.\nImmediately after being placed around the neck, a necklace of strangulation would constrict, making it impossible for the victim to breathe and resulting in their death after several minutes. The magic of the necklace could only be negated by a wish or limited wish. The necklaces magic was also masked by spells such as detect curse. The necklace of strangulation continued to squeeze tightly to the victims neck long after their death until nothing remained by a dried skeleton."
