        "Description": "These [[potion]]s were vials of swirling red liquid.",
        "Powers": "Consumption of a ''potion of frenzy'' was similar in effect to the ''[[blood frenzy]]'' spell. The imbiber entered a state of battle berserker rage. Their strength and stamina increased, as well as their mental defenses, however the state of frenzy made them easier targets for successful strikes.",
        "Notable Owners": "* The [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] possessed a rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews. Among them were ''potion of polymorph'' of her own creation.\n* [[Uzzak-Szalzik]], a [[lizardfolk]] [[shaman]] from the [[Lizard Marsh]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]."
