These [[boots]] were masterfully and painstakingly sewn together, and lined with soft [[wolf]]'s fur. The lining was enchanted to make the hunter's footfalls silent, improving their ability to sneak, stalk, and hide.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, ''wandering hunter's boots'' were crafted for all young hunters of the Wandering Village. Friends and visitors to the village could purchase these boots from [[Tahvo]] the Huntmaster, along with other supplies.
