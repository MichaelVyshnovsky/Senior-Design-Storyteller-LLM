'''''Hideo's kama''''' were [[enchanted]] [[kama]]s that originated from the [[Kyo Prefecture]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Powers==
Despite appearing as a simple peasant tool of trade, ''Hideo's kama'' were deadly weapons with a ''+2'' enchantment and magics that enhanced the wielder's parrying while in combat.

== History==
''Hideo's kama'' were created by [[Hideo]] to arm peasants for the defense of their home â€“ Kyo Prefecture. The simple folk were harassed by a band of marauding pirates, and with the help of these magic implements, they survived the battle. Soon after, Hideo himself fell out of favor with the locals and perished in poverty as he used up all of his money in the development and production of these kama.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], several of ''Hideo's kama'' found way west and ended up in the hands of merchants and adventurers of the [[Sword Coast]] and the city of [[Neverwinter]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Okuzo's Imports]] store in [[Westgate]]'s [[Harbor Loop]] had ''Hideo's kama'' in stock, brought straight from Kara-Tur.
