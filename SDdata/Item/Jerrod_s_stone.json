On the brink of victory, Arakon opened a portal to [[Baator]].  To save the inhabitants of [[Faer√ªn]], Jerrod leaped into the passageway and stopped the [[demon]] horde. Around [[1281 DR]], [[Everard]] of [[Easthaven]], devotee of [[Tempus]], saved [[Toril]] from the [[baatezu]] [[Belhifet]] by using his body to close the portal to the [[plane]]s."
