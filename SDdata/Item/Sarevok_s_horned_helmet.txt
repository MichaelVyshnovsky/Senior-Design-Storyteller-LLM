'''''Sarevok's horned helmet''''' was the unique helm worn by the infamous [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok Anchev]].

==Description==
It resembled the skull of some [[fiend]]ish creature, the maw of which opened up to reveal the face of the wearer.

==Powers==
The helm granted the wearer several boons. It bolstered their physical fortitude and protected them from all manner of spells or effects that attempted to manipulate their emotions, most notably fear or terror.

It also granted the wearer the 'Deathbringer's sight'. This power both allowed them to [[darkvision|see in darkness]] from {{SIrange|3|15|ft|long=yes}} away, and also allowed them to land more vicious and deadly blows in battle.

==History==
Sarevok wore his helm in his fateful battle with his half-brother [[Abdel Adrian]] in the [[Temple of Bhaal (Undercity)|Bhaalist temple]] beneath [[Baldur's Gate]]. That battle became famous among the followers of Sarevok's divine father [[Bhaal]].

After Sarevok's death, he was resurrected by his brother and compelled to play a role in Abdel's confrontation with other mortal Bhaalspawn. At some point during the following century, Sarevok came into possession of his ''horned helm'' once again, and wore it as he presided over the Murder Tribunal in Bhaal's temple in the [[Undercity]] of Baldur's Gate.
