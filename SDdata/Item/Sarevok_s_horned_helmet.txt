Sarevoks horned helmet was the unique helm worn by the infamous Bhaalspawn Sarevok Anchev.
It resembled the skull of some fiendish creature, the maw of which opened up to reveal the face of the wearer.
The helm granted the wearer several boons. It bolstered their physical fortitude and protected them from all manner of spells or effects that attempted to manipulate their emotions, most notably fear or terror.
It also granted the wearer the Deathbringers sight. This power both allowed them to see in darkness from  away, and also allowed them to land more vicious and deadly blows in battle.
Sarevok wore his helm in his fateful battle with his half-brother Abdel Adrian in the Bhaalist temple beneath Baldurs Gate. That battle became famous among the followers of Sarevoks divine father Bhaal.
After Sarevoks death, he was resurrected by his brother and compelled to play a role in Abdels confrontation with other mortal Bhaalspawn. At some point during the following century, Sarevok came into possession of his horned helm once again, and wore it as he presided over the Murder Tribunal in Bhaals temple in the Undercity of Baldurs Gate.
