        "mainbody": "'''Wooden pegs''' were simple fasteners that were used in carpentry and construction. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]], [[nail]]s, and [[spike]]s.",
        "Description": "Pegs were similar to wooden [[stake]]s, but were smaller and not intended for camping or other rough uses. They were cut with one pointed end and one flat end.",
        "Availability": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' offered a selection of pegs and related tools in various configurations and sizes. Pegs were available and cut to length from long dowels in ½\" (5 [[cp]]/foot), {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} (1 [[sp]]/foot), and {{SIAdj|2|inch|c|long=yes}} (3 sp/foot) diameters.",
        "Usage": "Wooden pegs and nails were generally less popular than metal nails and spikes, as they had shorter functional lifespans and were more susceptible to weathering.\n\nNails and pegs were commonly used for ship construction in [[Faerûn]], while in [[Zakhara]] this was avoided, with ship timbers instead sewn together with [[coconut]] fiber [[rope]]. This produced lighter ships that better handled reefs and shoals, and allowed them to survive the influence of a great [[lodestone]] deposit beneath the [[Crowded Sea]].\n\nIn the ancient [[Netherese]] city of [[Scourge (city)|Scourge]], the region's unnatural rusting winds meant that nails (and any other metal fittings, tools, and weapons) were useless. Instead, wooden nails were used for construction."
