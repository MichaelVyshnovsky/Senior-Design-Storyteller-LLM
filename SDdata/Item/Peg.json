        "mainbody": "Wooden pegs were simple fasteners that were used in carpentry and construction. They belonged to a broad class of hardware that included bolts, nails, and spikes.\nPegs were similar to wooden stakes, but were smaller and not intended for camping or other rough uses. They were cut with one pointed end and one flat end.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue offered a selection of pegs and related tools in various configurations and sizes. Pegs were available and cut to length from long dowels in ½\" (5 cp/foot),  (1 sp/foot), and  (3 sp/foot) diameters.\nWooden pegs and nails were generally less popular than metal nails and spikes, as they had shorter functional lifespans and were more susceptible to weathering.\nNails and pegs were commonly used for ship construction in Faerûn, while in Zakhara this was avoided, with ship timbers instead sewn together with coconut fiber rope. This produced lighter ships that better handled reefs and shoals, and allowed them to survive the influence of a great lodestone deposit beneath the Crowded Sea.\nIn the ancient Netherese city of Scourge, the regions unnatural rusting winds meant that nails (and any other metal fittings, tools, and weapons) were useless. Instead, wooden nails were used for construction."
