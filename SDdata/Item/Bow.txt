'''Bows''' were two-handed, muscle-powered projectile weapons used to shoot [[arrow]]s at distant targets.

==Description==
Bows came in a variety of different sizes and could be made of wood, horn, or bone. Composite bows were made of thin layers of these materials laminated together for extra strength. The earliest bows in recorded history typically had strings made of either animal tendons or plant fiber.

==Weaponology==
Though bows varied in the ranges they could reach, the strength of an archer could increase that potential range and damage. However, a bow needed be built to withstand higher forces. Composite bows were necessary to take full advantage of great strength.

One of the biggest problems facing any archer was deciding what to do when a foe got within melee reach.

==Types of Bows==

In the Realms bows generally fell into one of two classifications: [[shortbow]]s and [[longbow]]s. 

Shortbows were the first type of bow to developed, although they were not referred to by that term until much later after the invention of the longbow. And as their name implied, they were smaller than longbows, with correspondingly less range and penetration. Over time longbows were developed as people gave bows longer staves in an effort to increase their range. though other found ways of increasing the flexibility of bows without increasing the length of their staves.

A third classification of bow was the composite. This could be either a long or shortbow, with the distinction being that a composite had a stave made of more than one material. This gave the bow greater flexibility and consequently greater range.
===Varieties===
* [[Elven bow]]s were thicker and heavier than normal bows. The ingenuity of the [[elf|elven]] bowyers that crafted them made it so they worked just as well as melee weapons.
* Some bows were designed for use by children and sold alongside non-lethal arrows as [[Bow and arrow set (play)|bow and arrow sets]].

==Price==
The price of a bow was often greater than the price of a [[sword]]. In addition, one had to consider the added cost of the weapon's needed arrows. Being built to withstand higher forces typically increased the cost of a bow dramatically.

==Notable Users of Bows==
===Classes===
* [[Plumaweaver]]s were typically proficient in the use of bows. 
* [[Ranger]]s were proficient with all simple and martial weapons and could choose archery as a combat style.
* [[Rogue]]s were proficient with the shortbow but not the longbow because it was not easy to conceal or carry while moving stealthily.
===Groups===
* The [[Eagle Knight]]s of [[Maztica]] were typically known to utilize bows.
* The [[Sisters of Synnoria]] cavalry company were known to fight with bows.
===Individuals===
* [[Astarion]]
* [[Catti-brie]]
* [[Dauphal]]
* [[Kanon]]
* [[Saarvin]]
* [[Strahd von Zarovich]]
* [[Ziraj]]
===Races & Intelligent Creatures===
* [[Centaur]]s were known to favor the use of bows, especially composite ones. [[nomadic centaur]]s, and [[zebranaur]]s. Though nomadic centaurs preferred the use of shortbows.
* Elves esteemed the art of archery and were proficient with long and short bows, as well as the composite versions of each. They were particularly a common weapon among [[wild elves]]. And [[aquatic elves]] had their own unique [[aquatic longbow]]s.
* Both [[lightfoot halfling|lightfoot]] and [[stout halfling]]s were typically known to use shortbows.
* Though primarily known for using primitive weaponry, some archers among [[harpies]] mastered the use of bows.
* [[Swanmay]]s, when in their human form, would often use bows to attack their enemies from afar.
