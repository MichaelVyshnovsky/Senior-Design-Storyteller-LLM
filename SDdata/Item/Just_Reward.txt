'''''Just Reward''''' was the personal weapon of the [[avatar]]s of [[Osiris]], the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] [[deity]] of death.

==Description==
This weapon resembled a ceremonial [[flail]]. Accounts varied on whether it was equivalent to a light [[horseman's flail]] or a heavy [[footman's flail]], though the harm it caused was far greater than both.

==Powers==
''Just Reward'' carried a ''+3'' [[enchantment]] and had the same powers as a ''[[mace of disruption]]''.
