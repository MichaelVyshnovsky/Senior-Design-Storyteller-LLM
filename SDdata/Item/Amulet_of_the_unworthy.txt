'''''Amulet of the unworthy''''' was [[belt]] bucked from the ''[[Protector of the Unworthy]]'' enchanted item that was fashioned into an amulet.

==Description==
Unlike the ''Protector of the Unworthy'', ''amulet of the unworthy'' was made into a necklace that could be worn by creatures of any size.

==Powers==
The amulet's magic made the wearer resistant to slashing damage, but vulnerable to bludgeoning.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], an ''amulet of the unworthy'' was worn by an angry [[minotaur]] in the depths of the [[Underdark]], not far from the [[Shattered Sanctum]]'s underground stronghold, underneath the [[Western Heartlands]].
