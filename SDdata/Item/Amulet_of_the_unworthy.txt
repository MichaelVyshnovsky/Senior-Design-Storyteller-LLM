Amulet of the unworthy was belt bucked from the Protector of the Unworthy enchanted item that was fashioned into an amulet.
Unlike the Protector of the Unworthy, amulet of the unworthy was made into a necklace that could be worn by creatures of any size.
The amulets magic made the wearer resistant to slashing damage, but vulnerable to bludgeoning.
In 1492 DR, an amulet of the unworthy was worn by an angry minotaur in the depths of the Underdark, not far from the Shattered Sanctums underground stronghold, underneath the Western Heartlands.
