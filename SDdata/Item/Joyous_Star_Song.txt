Joyous Star Song were scrolls of sheet music providing bards with divine inspiration.
The scrolls were made of beaten silver, and stamped with the symbols of Milil and Lliira. They were inscribed with musical notations and lyrics for inspiring songs.
Once per day, a bard singing the song inscribed on the scroll would receive divine inspiration, performing longer and better than usual.
The first Joyous Star Song scrolls were created by the Church of Milil and the Church of Lliira.
