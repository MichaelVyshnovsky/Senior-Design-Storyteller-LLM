        "Powers": "When consumed, ''elixirs of peerless focus'' provided a valuable boon to spellcasters by steeling their minds and improving their focus and concentration on [[spell]]s. As a side effect, the potion made it harder for the imbiber to fall victim to the ''[[charm]]'' spell and immune to ''[[sleep]]ing'' magics and [[poison]]s. The elixir's effects lasted until the imbiber rested for at least eight consecutive hours.",
