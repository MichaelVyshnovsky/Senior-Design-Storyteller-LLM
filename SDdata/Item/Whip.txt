'''''Whips''''' were a type of exotic, one-handed melee weapon.

==Description==
The whip was a long, flexible, braided leather cord which tapered gradually from the handle to the tip. The handle was either thick braided leather or leather-covered wood and was {{SIrange|8|12|in|long=yes}} in length. When stretched to full length, the whip could be up to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length. An optional tassel of horsehair or twine on the end (called a cracker) amplified the sound of the whip. The average weighed around {{SI|2|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==Weaponology==
The whip was mostly effective against unarmored creatures. The weapon had an effective range of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}. Whips could also be used to trip opponents and they were particularly good at disarming. However, it took special training and practice to use a whip effectively without hurting oneself.

==Availability==
* In the city of [[Raven's Bluff]], leather whips of assorted lengths and styles could be found for sale at [[Tym's Supple Leather Shoppe]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/39/The Living City: Tym's Supple Leather Shoppe}}

==Notable whips==
* ''[[Scourge of fangs]]''
* ''[[Whip of constricting]]''

==Trivia==
* Whips were the only weapon permissible for [[chariot]]eers to use in the [[Thulbanian Games]].
