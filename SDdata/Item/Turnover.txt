'''Turnovers''' were a type of sweet [[bread]] handfood, filled with fruit, found in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[the Vast]].

==Description==
[[Apple]] turnovers were one of the most popular street foods favored by laborers and builders of Ravens Bluff. Street vendors in a market by the [[Harbor Gate]] sold many foods, including apple turnovers. [[Blueberry]] turnovers could be found in the town of [[Mossbridges]] made with locally grown fresh berries.

A savory type of turnover was known to be prepared in the [[Underdark]]. A recipe for [[sauteed bat-rat turnovers]] was recorded in a rare set of ''[[Cookbooks of the Underdark]]'', retrieved and brought to Ravens Bluff in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
