'''''Mirabel's pendant''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[cameo]] that once was worn by the [[Red Wizard]] [[diviner]] named [[Mirabel]], until her death in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
''Mirabel's pendant'' was a delicate [[ivory]] cameo, suspended on a burgundy ribbon [[Choker (necklace)|choker]]. The amulet was a beautifully-carved visage of bald-headed woman within an intricate [[silver]] frame. The cameo's backside had an engraving in [[Mulhorandi language]]—just two letters: "A.L."

==Powers==
The choker possessed a minor enchantment that improved the wearer's knowledge of all things [[arcane]].

==History==
''Mirabel's pendant'' was worn by its original owner, a Red Wizard woman who was sent to the [[Z'Hinda Citadel]] underneath [[The Spine of the World]] by her masters to kill a group of mercenaries from [[Targos]]. Mirabel's Red Wizard masters were allied with the [[Legion of the Chimera]] and sought to stop the adventurers' advancement towards the secluded town of [[Kuldahar]]. However, Mirabel and her partner both were killed by the adventurers. The pendant's fate remained undocumented.
