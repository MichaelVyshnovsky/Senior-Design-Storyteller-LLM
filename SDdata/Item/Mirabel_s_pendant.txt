Mirabels pendant was a unique enchanted cameo that once was worn by the Red Wizard diviner named Mirabel, until her death in the early 14 century DR.
Mirabels pendant was a delicate ivory cameo, suspended on a burgundy ribbon choker. The amulet was a beautifully-carved visage of bald-headed woman within an intricate silver frame. The cameos backside had an engraving in Mulhorandi languageâ€”just two letters "A.L."
The choker possessed a minor enchantment that improved the wearers knowledge of all things arcane.
Mirabels pendant was worn by its original owner, a Red Wizard woman who was sent to the ZHinda Citadel underneath The Spine of the World by her masters to kill a group of mercenaries from Targos. Mirabels Red Wizard masters were allied with the Legion of the Chimera and sought to stop the adventurers advancement towards the secluded town of Kuldahar. However, Mirabel and her partner both were killed by the adventurers. The pendants fate remained undocumented.
