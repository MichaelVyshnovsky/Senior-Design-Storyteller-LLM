The balls on offer came in three sizes: {{SIAdj|2|in|long=yes}} balls perfect for juggling at 1 [[silver piece]], {{SIAdj|4|in|long=yes}} handballs for 2 silver pieces, and a cloth-wrapped {{SIAdj|12|in|long=yes}} ball for 2 [[gold piece]]s. Additionally, in its "Bard's Emporium" section, the catalogue offered jugglable leather balls in sets of three for 5 silver pieces.

They sold the same-sized balls as ''Aurora's'' and at the same prices, though additionally offered {{SIAdj|8|in|long=yes}} balls at a price of 8 silver pieces.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Selûne|23}}
