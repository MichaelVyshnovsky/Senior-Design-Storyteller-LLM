        "Description": "''Celestial blades'' were powerful [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[bastard sword]]s sized for planetars, and they weighed about {{SI|12|lb|k|long=yes}}. The planetar's weapon always glowed with light equivalent to that of a [[torch]]. It was usually enscribed with [[holy symbol]] of the deity whom the planetar served. While not at all likely to be sold in any shop on the [[Material Plane]], scholars estimated their value to be around 18,000 [[gold piece]]s. They radiated an [[evocation]] aura of moderate strength to those who could [[detect magic]].",
        "Powers": "A ''celestial blade'' had no [[Weapon quality|special powers]] beyond its light and its general magical enhancement, but in the hands of a planetar or other [[celestial]], it could cut through the inherent supernatural defenses of most evil creatures."
