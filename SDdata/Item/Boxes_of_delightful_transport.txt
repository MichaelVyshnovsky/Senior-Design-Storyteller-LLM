'''''Boxes of delightful transport''''' were pairs of magical containers that could be used to transport non-magical objects between them from far distances. They were most often utilized by [[thieves]] to send messages between one another.

==Description==
Each ''box of transport'' was a wooden cube, measuring {{SI|6|in|long=yes}}, and often decorated in great detail.

==Powers==
After placing an object in one of a pair of ''boxes of delightful transport'' and closing its lid, all one had to do was speak its [[command word]] and the object would be magically transported to its matching box. This power could be activated up to three times per day. There was no distance limit between the boxes, though they could not transport objects between different [[planes of existence]] and there was always a 5% chance that the object would not reach its matching box, instead ending up somewhere else within {{SIrange|10|100|mile|long=yes}}.

''Boxes of delightful transport'' could not function with anything living, nor any object that was magical in nature or enspelled, such as by ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]''.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Misti Morgan]], a thief who operated in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|16}}
