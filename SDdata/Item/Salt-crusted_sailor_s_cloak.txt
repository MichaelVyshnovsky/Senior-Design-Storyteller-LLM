Salt-crusted sailors cloaks were enchanted cloaks used by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords.
Whether the sea salts effects of minor magics weaved into the clothing, salt-crusted sailors cloaks increased the wearers protection against all known diseases.
These sailors cloaks were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered these items for sale.
