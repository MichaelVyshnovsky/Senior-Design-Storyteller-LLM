        "mainbody": "eleportation bolts were a type of enchanted crossbow ammunition created by an adventurer named Visgove.\nThese enchanted bolts were not designed to deal damage to the target, instead, upon a successful impact, they teleported the target towards the shooter via magic.\nVisgove was an adventurer renowned for his spectacular laziness. No one was surprised when the man sank a significant amount of coin into developing these magic bolts sometime before 1372 DR. Why would Visgove run across a battlefield when it was much easier to transport an enemy directly into the range of his battle axe.\nEven though expensive, by 1373 DR, teleportation bolts were in use in Zhentil Keep of the Moonsea region."
