The '''''Pillars of Knowledge''''' were a pair of unique [[boots]] which had been [[enchanted]] by [[Vajra Safahr]] for her own use in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Pillars of Knowledge'' allowed Vajra to move silently, which she used both to stride the libraries and laboratories of [[Blackstaff Academy]] without disturbing any ongoing study and research, and in combat to get the drop on enemies as she moved about the battlefield.

==Notable Owners==
* Vajra Safahr, the [[Blackstaff]] of Waterdeep, during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
