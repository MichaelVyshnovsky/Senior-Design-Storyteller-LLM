The Pillars of Knowledge were a pair of unique boots which had been enchanted by Vajra Safahr for her own use in the late 15 century DR.
The Pillars of Knowledge allowed Vajra to move silently, which she used both to stride the libraries and laboratories of Blackstaff Academy without disturbing any ongoing study and research, and in combat to get the drop on enemies as she moved about the battlefield.
