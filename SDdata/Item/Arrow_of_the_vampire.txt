Arrows of the vampire were a type of enchanted ammunition often used by various bowmen of the Realms.
These arrows were enchanted with spells similar in effect to the vampiric regeneration. When an arrow of the vampire hit its target, the magics inside syphoned the life energy out of the target and into the shooter.
In the mid-14 century DR, many enchanted arrows of the vampire were a common sight along the Sword Coast, and used by numerous individuals and factions. The origin of these arrows, however, remained a mystery. Some told stories that arrows of the vampire were made using teeth of actual vampires. This was probably not true due to the sheer number of these arrows circulating the quivers in the Realms.
* Feldran Exeltis, a lone heir of the Exeltis noble family kept a quiver of the arrows of the vampire in his bedroom circa 1372 DR.
