An aba of the desert was a magical garment that could be found in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Abas were light robes or cloaks in Zakhara.
Wearing one of these items granted the wearer all of the effects of the cool strength spell, which was a very useful feature for the desert tribes.
The wearer could not use this item with any armor heavier than leather armor.
A desert tribe in possession of one of these magical garments often allowed their aged, ill, or pregnant tribe members to use them in order to ease their strains.
