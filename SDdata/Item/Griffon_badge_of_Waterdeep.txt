Griffon badges of Waterdeep, which were also simply called griffon badges, were magic amulets that were carried by each member of Waterdeeps Griffon Cavalry.
The amulets were made from silver and inscribed with a griffon flying above the arms of Waterdeep.
A griffon badge allowed its wearer to use the feather fall spell once per day.
