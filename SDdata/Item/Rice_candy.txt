Rice candies were a type of chewy candy from Shou Lung. They were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
Flavored with flower essences and exotic fruits which conferred them a tart taste, rice candies had a chewy and gelatinous texture. Candies purchased through Auroras came in packages containing mixed assorted flavors.
* The Faer√ªnian deity Nobanion had a peculiar sentimental fondness for rice candies.
