        "mainbody": "Soulemans Sublime was a type of wine, local to the city of Westgate on the Dragon Coast.\nSoulemans Sublime was a thick and pungent wine, a specialty of a well-respected brewery in Westgate. Despite its taste and texture, the concoction went down smoothly, making the drinker feel a sensation of flight.\nBy the late 14 century DR, this popular wine could be purchased in many of Westgates inns and drinking establishments, including The Track, an underground racing ring and gambling establishment on the Market Triangle."
