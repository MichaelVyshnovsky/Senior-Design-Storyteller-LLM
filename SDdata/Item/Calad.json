        "mainbody": "Calad was a poison that was available in many places across Faer√ªn.\nThis opaque fluid had a hue that resembled liquid gold. It was distilled from the brain juices of basilisks, catoblepas, and disenchanters.\nUpon ingesting, the victim experienced a disorienting degradation in vision and hearing. This poison also corroded the victims internal organs. Both effects did not last long, but rendered the victim vulnerable and damaged."
