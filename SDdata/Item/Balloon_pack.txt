A '''''balloon pack''''' was an uncommon variety of [[elemental magic]]al equipment, used by members of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]],<ref> that harnessed the power of [[elemental air]] to provide its user a limited degree of flight.

==Description==
''Balloon packs'' consisted of a [[backpack]], containing a trapped [[air elemental]] and a compact leather balloon.

==Powers==
When activated, a ''balloon pack's'' titular balloon would inflate and imitate the effects of the ''[[levitation]]'' [[spell]] upon the user for a period of ten minutes. Alternatively, if the user activated the ''balloon pack'' whilst falling it would imitate the effects of ''[[feather fall]]'' for a equal length of time. In either case, when the ten minute period subsided the air elemental returned to the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] and the pack's leather balloon would begin to deflate, granting the user a gentle descent for at least {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.

Once used, a ''balloon pack'' had to have another air elemental bound to it in order to be used again. This required charging the ''balloon pack'' at an elemental node of air for one hour.
