A balloon pack was an uncommon variety of elemental magical equipment, used by members of the Cult of the Howling Hatred in the 15 century DR, that harnessed the power of elemental air to provide its user a limited degree of flight.
Balloon packs consisted of a backpack, containing a trapped air elemental and a compact leather balloon.
When activated, a balloon packs titular balloon would inflate and imitate the effects of the levitation spell upon the user for a period of ten minutes. Alternatively, if the user activated the balloon pack whilst falling it would imitate the effects of feather fall for a equal length of time. In either case, when the ten minute period subsided the air elemental returned to the Elemental Plane of Air and the packs leather balloon would begin to deflate, granting the user a gentle descent for at least .
Once used, a balloon pack had to have another air elemental bound to it in order to be used again. This required charging the balloon pack at an elemental node of air for one hour.
