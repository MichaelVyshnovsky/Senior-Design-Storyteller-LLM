A '''''rupturing blade''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[rapier]] that could grow deadlier when the wielder spilled blood.

==Powers==
''Rupturing blade'' possessed a minor ''+1'' enchantment that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and boosted its damage. Additionally, when the wielder pricked themselves on the blade and spilled blood, the rapier's point split into heated barbs that rent and burned the targets.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a ''rupturing blade'' could be found in the hands of [[Brem]], an agent of the [[Zhentarim]] who laired in the Zhent hideout underneath the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn in the [[Western Heartlands]].
