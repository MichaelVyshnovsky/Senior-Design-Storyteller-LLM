}}The '''Well of Despair''' was a mythical enchanted spring found within the [[Weeping Desert]] in the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[interior Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Powers==
The cold dark waters of the Well were believed to provide visions of the future to any who drank from it. However, as the Well was located within a mausoleum of [[undead]] [[rom]], anyone wishing to drink from the well needed to deal with the [[giant]]s first.
