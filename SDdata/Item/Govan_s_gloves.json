        "mainbody": "'''''Govan's gloves''''' were [[enchanted]] gloves that belonged to [[druid]] [[Govan Irfandel]] who was renown for erecting the Stone Circle of Govan of the [[Brush of Barbs]] ''circa'' [[1072 DR]].",
        "Powers": "''Govan's gloves'' were enchanted to allow the wearer to cast the ''[[one with the land]]'' [[spell]] once per day, enhancing the user's connection to animals and plant life. Due to the nature of the magic imbued within these gloves, they could only be used by druids and [[ranger]]s.",
        "History": "Govan Irfandel was said to have created these magic gloves to enhance his natural affinity with the land and its inhabitants. With these powers he enlisted the aid of [[tree]]s, thickets, and vines of the Brush of Barbs to move the rocks into what was later became known as the Stone Circle of Govan around 1072 DR.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], ''Govan's gloves'' could be found in one of the piles of junk and \"antiques\" within [[Torleth's Treasures]] of [[Gillian's Hill]], being sold for 300 [[gold]] pieces."
