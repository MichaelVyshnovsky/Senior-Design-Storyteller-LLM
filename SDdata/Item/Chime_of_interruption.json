        "mainbody": "A '''''chime of interruption''''' was a type of small [[enchanted|magical]] [[chime]] with an effect designed to disrupt [[spellcaster]]s.",
        "Powers": "These chimes emitted a moderate [[aura]] of [[evocation]] [[magic]].\n\nOnce the resonant tone faded, the user would have to wait 7 minutes before they could strike it again. If struck again before this period of rest concluded, the ''chime of interruption'' would produce no sound and the rest period would reset, requiring a full 10 minutes to elapse before it could be activated again.",
        "Creation": "Crafting a ''chime of interruption'' required a spellcaster skilled in crafting wondrous items and the spell ''[[shout]]''.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Bandaerl]], a [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[archlich]].<ref name=UtLL-p29>\n* [[Olonthor]] the \"Minstrel Wyrm\" had a ''chime of interruption'' in his treasure horde by [[1374 DR]].<ref>",
        "History": "One of the rooms in the [[Arcane Chambers]], the second floor of the infamous [[dungeon]] [[Undermountain]], was a regularly flooded complex home to an [[aboleth]] that had been imprisoned there by an apprentice of [[Halaster]] after some sort of experiment that had occurred prior to [[1358 DR]]. Over time many [[adventurer]]s fell victim to the room, leaving behind various magical items. By the year 1358 DR, one of the magic items that could be found in the room's muck was a ''chime of interruption''."
