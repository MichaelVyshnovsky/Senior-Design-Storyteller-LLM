Robes of the Shining Hand were enchanted robes created by the monks of the Shining Hand monastic order. Originating in Vaasa they were in high demand across many nations circa late 14 century DR.
Robes of the Shining Hand possessed a powerful enchantment that increased a monks reflexes and senses to such degree, they could easily shift their body absorbing even most powerful blows, dramatically increasing the wearers defense. These robes did have a negative effect, they wearer became extremely sensitive to sounds, making it hard to differentiate between a sound of snoring and a sound of a scattering mouse.
The order of the Shining Hand originated in Amn and encouraged the use of arcane magic, allowing wizards to join alongside monks. Fleeing Amns persecution of spellcasters, some settled in Vaasa creating the Shining Hand Monastery there. That branch of the order gained reputation and fortune by creating the Robes of the Shining Hand that became a valuable commodity in many regions across the Realms. In late 14 century, the monastery was hard at work creating variations on the enchanted robes that could be found in many places and traders inventories of the Sword Coast.
