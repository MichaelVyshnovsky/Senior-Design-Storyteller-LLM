        "mainbody": "Ring mail was a type of heavy armor used on Toril.\nRing mail was leather armor with large, weighted rings attached to it. Despite having a leather base, this sort of armor was classified as heavy. Its rings helped to reinforce the base against axe or sword strikes. It was inferior to chain, splint, and plate mail. However, it was a lot cheaper than the other suits of heavy armor, i.e., fifty times less expensive than plate mail. It was cheaper and provided more defense than studded leather armor, for those who were not so dexterous.\nWarhorses could don such armor, and again it was the cheapest option."
