A '''''ring of vulnerability''''' was a [[cursed]] [[ring]] that caused the wearer to be less protected from harm.

==Description==
These rings were essentially the opposite of ''[[ring of protection|rings of protection]]''. Anyone who wore the ring would find themselves less able to avoid a blow or resist a damaging effect.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[fire giant]] [[mage]], Ungleow, tried to enlist a group of heroes to join her plot. She offered one of these seemingly enchanted rings as a bribe. Around the same time, a ''ring of vulnerability'' was kept by a group of [[mage]]s of [[Hellgate Keep]] in [[Icewolf]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Ungleow]]
