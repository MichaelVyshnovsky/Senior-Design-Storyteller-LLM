'''Santrath''' was a type of [[bread]] invented in [[Athkatla]], the capital city of [[Amn]].

==Description==
Santrath was a sweetened bread with its dough made with [[yeast]] and [[egg]]s, similar to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challah challah] bread of [[Earth]]. It was named after a [[gnome|gnomish]] baker instrumental in Santrath's popularity.
