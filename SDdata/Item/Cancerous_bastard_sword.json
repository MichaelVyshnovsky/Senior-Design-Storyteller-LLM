        "mainbody": "'''''Cancerous bastard swords''''' were somewhat more common enchanted blades that could spread magical diseases on their targets.",
        "Description": "''Cancerous [[bastard sword]]s'' were masterfully crafted blades with faintly glowing blue arcane runes of power etched along their surfaces.",
        "Powers": "These blades were enchanted with morbid magic that had a fair chance of infecting the targets, upon a successful strike, with a dangerous [[disease]] that caused damage every two seconds until cured. Thus, a mere scrape by a ''cancerous bastard sword'' could prove deadly.",
        "History": "One such bastard sword belonged to Maiden [[Ilmadia]], one of the lieutenants of a [[devil]] known as [[Belhifet]] in [[1281 DR]]. She laired at the bottom of an ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] foundry of [[Dorn's Deep]] on the [[Spine of the World]]. She controlled the [[fire giant]] and [[salamander]] forces of Belhifet's monster army."
