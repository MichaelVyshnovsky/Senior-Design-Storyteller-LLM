'''''Dragonblood soup''''' was an [[enchanted]] dish imbued with [[the Art]] through [[foodomancy]].

==Description==
''Dragonblood soup'' was made using four [[wineskin]]s of [[red dragon]] blood, two wineskins of water, five handfuls of [[dragon]]flesh, unsalted [[butter]], the shredded heart of the same [[dragon]] as the blood, [[carrot]]s, [[celery]], and [[thyme]].

==Powers==
Like all other cookery of the foodomancy school of magic, all measurements and cooking times had to be precise, and no ingredient could be substituted or of lower quality than indicated in the diagrams and records. The cauldron needed to be greased with butter, then all liquid ingredients were poured into a [[cauldron]] and bought to a boil, cooking for 15–20 minutes. Following that, the foodomancer chopped and added [[carrot]]s, [[celery]], and [[thyme]]. Then the dragon's meat was diced into thumb-sized pieces and added to the cauldron and all together boiled for 20 more minutes. The total cooking time could not be over three hours or else the food's magic dissipated.

If prepared correctly, the ''dragonblood soup'' granted its imbiber protection from fire, their skin toughened up akin to that of a dragon, and they gained the ability to breathe fire with a strength similar to that of a red dragon hatchling, once per soup serving.

It was believed that similar recipes existed for other types of dragon flesh, but at the time Jonathan Greenleaf's work was published, a recipe had yet to be discovered, and the research continued. The author also claimed that the recipe's effects varied depending on the dragon's age and size.

==History==
The recipe for ''dragonblood soup'' was first recorded in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], after being researched and tested by [[Jonathan Greenleaf]] in his hand-written book dedicated to this culinary school of magic found in the city of [[Waterdeep]] and, eventually, in the hands of Lord [[Raventree]].
