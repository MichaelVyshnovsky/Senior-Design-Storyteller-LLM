Dragonblood soup was an enchanted dish imbued with the Art through foodomancy.
Dragonblood soup was made using four wineskins of red dragon blood, two wineskins of water, five handfuls of dragonflesh, unsalted butter, the shredded heart of the same dragon as the blood, carrots, celery, and thyme.
Like all other cookery of the foodomancy school of magic, all measurements and cooking times had to be precise, and no ingredient could be substituted or of lower quality than indicated in the diagrams and records. The cauldron needed to be greased with butter, then all liquid ingredients were poured into a cauldron and bought to a boil, cooking for 15â€“20 minutes. Following that, the foodomancer chopped and added carrots, celery, and thyme. Then the dragons meat was diced into thumb-sized pieces and added to the cauldron and all together boiled for 20 more minutes. The total cooking time could not be over three hours or else the foods magic dissipated.
If prepared correctly, the dragonblood soup granted its imbiber protection from fire, their skin toughened up akin to that of a dragon, and they gained the ability to breathe fire with a strength similar to that of a red dragon hatchling, once per soup serving.
It was believed that similar recipes existed for other types of dragon flesh, but at the time Jonathan Greenleafs work was published, a recipe had yet to be discovered, and the research continued. The author also claimed that the recipes effects varied depending on the dragons age and size.
The recipe for dragonblood soup was first recorded in the late 14 century DR, after being researched and tested by Jonathan Greenleaf in his hand-written book dedicated to this culinary school of magic found in the city of Waterdeep and, eventually, in the hands of Lord Raventree.
