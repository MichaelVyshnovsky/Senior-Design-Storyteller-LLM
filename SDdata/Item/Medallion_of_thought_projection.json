The major downside of using this item was its owner was unable to control the projection without rigorous training of the mind. With developed proficiency with the item, the user could control who the thoughts were projected on, while the rest of the creatures within range only received harmless vague impressions.\nIn the 14 century DR, a psionist Locke made a living using his medallion of thought projection as an entertainer. He used the amulet to mislead people into believing they were psychics. Locke also used his enchanted medallion to drastically improve his successes with the opposite gender.\n*Locke - an entertainer who owned one of the medallions of thought projection. This particular item was enchanted even further by a hired wizard to add the ability to cast the permanent suggestion spell, the enchantment Locke often used in his act and on his romantic partners."
