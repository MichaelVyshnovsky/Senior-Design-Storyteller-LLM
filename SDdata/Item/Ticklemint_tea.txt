'''Ticklemint tea''' was a [[tea]] made by steeping parts of the [[ticklemint]] plant in hot water. It was available in [[Icewind Dale]]. Ticklemint tea was used as a remedy for chilly fingers and toes, though the initial sips occasionally induced a sneeze in the drinker.{{Cite adventurers league/Uprising|5}}
