'''Gond bells''' were an odd type of hard [[currency]] in [[Faerûn]] that was circulated by worshipers and [[priest]]s of the [[Church of Gond]].

==Description==
This currency were small [[bell]]s made of [[brass]], almost wholy enclosed within loose ornamental stone that caused them to clatter.

==Availability==
Gond bells were most found in use in the nation of [[Lantan]], who introduced the currency to Faerûn, and in areas around [[the North]], particularly among members of the [[Gond]] faith.

==Value==
Across Faerûn, gond bells generally were valued at a price of 10 [[gold piece]]s. However, when used within temples of Gond they were valued at 20 gold pieces.
