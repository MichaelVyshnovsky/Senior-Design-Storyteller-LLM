Gond bells were an odd type of hard currency in Faerûn that was circulated by worshipers and priests of the Church of Gond.
This currency were small bells made of brass, almost wholy enclosed within loose ornamental stone that caused them to clatter.
Gond bells were most found in use in the nation of Lantan, who introduced the currency to Faerûn, and in areas around the North, particularly among members of the Gond faith.
Across Faerûn, gond bells generally were valued at a price of 10 gold pieces. However, when used within temples of Gond they were valued at 20 gold pieces.
