'''Awls''' were a kind of small, handheld tool used for various trades.

==Description==
Though there were different designs, the typical awl had a {{SIAdj|3|inch|c|long=yes}} or longer [[needle]]-like metal tip with a wooden handle,

==Usage==
Awls were widely used for working with leather and fabrics, allowing the artisan to punch holes through material and make clothing, armor, shoes, and other products. Other awls were used by woodworkers to scratch lines to mark the wood, or to tap shallow holes in preparation for [[nail]]s. A similar but larger device called an '''auger''' was used to prepare holes for larger [[spike (item)|spikes]].
