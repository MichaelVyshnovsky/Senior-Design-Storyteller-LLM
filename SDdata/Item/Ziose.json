        "mainbody": "iose was the nameThe name of the actual mineral, zoisite is misspelled ziosite in the references. It appears the Realms name for this mineral was derived from that misspelling. given by sages to a particularly transparent variety of rosaline.\nZiose was a rare mineral that yielded facet-grade stones that flashed three different colors depending on how the light refracted through them or at what angle they were viewed&mdashpurple, blue, and red, or purple, green, and red (see Gallery). Very large (fist-, foot-, or human-head sized) specimens of these fancy stones were sometimes found and prized for use in pendants by very tall humans, demihumans, and humanoids. A typical stone had a base value of 100 gp.\nA ziose gem could fire multiple barrages of magic missiles at the command of the last creature to touch it, provided that creature had intelligence and knowledge of this ability. This being had to be within a few yards (meters) of the gemstone and only had to will it to happen. Salvos of missiles would continue for a few minutes and then cease. The ziose could not be activated again until it had time to recharge. This ability required no other effort or concentration from the activator, so it is unclear whether multiple targets could be affected, or whether the missiles came out of a single facet all in the same direction.\n*A temple of Mystra in Halruaa once had a ziose crystal hovering over a well of magical water, allowing it to be defended."
