It appears the Realms name for this mineral was derived from that misspelling. given by [[sage|sages]] to a particularly transparent variety of [[rosaline]].",
        "Description": "Ziose was a rare mineral that yielded facet-grade stones that flashed three different colors depending on how the light refracted through them or at what angle they were viewed&mdash;purple, blue, and red, or purple, green, and red (see [[ziose#Gallery|Gallery]]). Very large (fist-, foot-, or human-head sized) specimens of these [[fancy stones]] were sometimes found and prized for use in pendants by very tall [[human|humans]], [[demihuman|demihumans]], and [[humanoid|humanoids]]. A typical stone had a base value of 100 gp.",
        "Powers": "A ziose [[gem]] could fire multiple barrages of ''[[magic missile]]s'' at the command of the last creature to touch it, provided that creature had intelligence and knowledge of this ability. This being had to be within a few yards (meters) of the gemstone and only had to will it to happen. Salvos of missiles would continue for a few minutes and then cease. The ziose could not be activated again until it had time to recharge. This ability required no other effort or concentration from the activator, so it is unclear whether multiple targets could be affected, or whether the missiles came out of a single facet all in the same direction.",
        "Notable Items": "*A temple of [[Mystra]] in [[Halruaa]] once had a ziose crystal hovering over a well of magical water, allowing it to be defended."
