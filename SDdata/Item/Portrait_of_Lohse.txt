'''''Portrait of Lohse''''' was a painting depicting a [[spell]]-weaving woman, created sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The woman in the painting was pictured enveloped by waves of purple magic. Her blue and brown dress and red hair, streaked with white, were wildly flopping with the wild magic. Apparently, this picture captured a [[bard]], mid-dance, and the painter captured something special about the woman's eyes, as if there was more than one soul behind them.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Portrait of Lohse'' was found within the [[druid]]s' library of the [[Emerald Grove]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].
