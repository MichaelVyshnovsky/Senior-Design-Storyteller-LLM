        "mainbody": "he helm of hiding was an enchanted helmet that hid its wearer from magical prying.\nIt appeared to be a rather plain old war helm.\nPer Laeral Rythkyn, a Harper wizard of note, it prevented all mental scrying on the wearer, hid them from searching magic, and allowed them to cloak themselves in shadow on command.
