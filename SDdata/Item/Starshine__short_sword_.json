        "mainbody": "'''''Starshine''''' was a unique [[mithril]] [[short sword]] forged by the song-smith named [[Gehorg Diamondforge]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Powers": "This weapons had a powerful ''+4'' [[enchantment]] placed in place that guided the wielder's hand towards the target and made the ax's slashes more devastating. Additionally, ''Starshine'' could detect presence of [[lycanthrope]]s even when they were in their [[humanoid]] form. The wielder could also cast ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[starshine]]'', ''[[moonbeam]]'', and ''[[lightning bolt]]'' [[spell]]s from the blade.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} Gehorg Diamondforge and many other stores of Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Market District|Market District]] fell victim to extortion by a group of criminals. These people—[[Marella]], [[Elizza]], [[Moamar]], and [[Rundell]]—were members of the warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s army that waged war on [[the Vast]] just a year prior. Gehorg spent years of his life creating weapons of great power through the ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] art of song-smithing. The master smith lost several magic weapons to the extortionists: ''[[Stone Splitter]]'', ''[[Icicle (long sword)|Icicle]]'', ''[[Flame Quencher]]'', and ''Starshine''. This loss disillusioned Gehorg Diamondforge, and he decided to leave Ravens Bluff and its corruption unless the city was to reimburse him for the masterworks lost to the people whom he perceived to be Living City watchmen."
