        "mainbody": "'''''Kossuth's Blood''''' was a [[magic]]al [[amulet]] associated with the Lord of Fire [[Kossuth]] that first appeared in the Realms during the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It appeared as a unique black sphere resembling a giant eye that contained a small, continual flame.",
        "Powers": "''Kossuth's Blood '' allowed the wearer to cast [[spell]]s in a more expedient manner and also made any mundane or magical flames they produced more damaging to their targets.",
        "History": "The amulet was formed in the {{YearlinkName|801}}, when a large group of Kossuth's faithful called upon his [[avatar]] to aid them against an [[giant octopus|enormous octopus]] menacing one of their coastal temples. Kossuth obliged and manifested in the form of an enormous bonfire and slew the beast, but not before it managed to damage him. Some of the god's fiery essence was drawn into its body and settled within one of its eyes, transforming it into the orb.\n\n''Kossuth's Blood'' later ended up in a [[remorhaz]] pit in the [[Gloomfrost]] of [[Icewind Dale]] by [[1281 DR]]."
