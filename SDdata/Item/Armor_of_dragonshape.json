        "Description": "An ''armor of dragonshape'' was a hide armor made of [[dragonhide]] that was treated to become a dragoncraft item.",
        "Powers": "[[File:Sizes.jpg|thumb|right|''An armor of dragonshape allowed the wearer to change into a dragon of halfling to human size (second and third from left), not into the big form of a full-grown dragon (far right).'']]\nAs mentioned above, an ''armor of dragonshape'' was a ''+3 dragoncraft hide armor''. As an [[armor]] made of dragonhide, it was impossible to destroy with the kind of energy that the [[dragon]] from which the hide originated from breathed. The dragonhide was treated to be crafted into a dragoncraft item and therefore conferred the wearer some degree of protection against the aforementioned energy. Both of these qualities were of mundane nature and not susceptible to an ''[[antimagic field]]''.\n\nFurthermore, an ''armor of dragonshape'' was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] armor. It had the qualities of a ''+3 hide armor'' and provided one more ability to those who had the ability to ''[[wild shape]]'', Such people could change their forms into those of dragons of [[halfling]] to [[human]] size. This shapechange caused no drain on the wearer's ability to shapechange by means of his or her ''wild shape'' ability.",
