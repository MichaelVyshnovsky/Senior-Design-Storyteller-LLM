As an armor made of dragonhide, it was impossible to destroy with the kind of energy that the dragon from which the hide originated from breathed. The dragonhide was treated to be crafted into a dragoncraft item and therefore conferred the wearer some degree of protection against the aforementioned energy. Both of these qualities were of mundane nature and not susceptible to an antimagic field.\nFurthermore, an armor of dragonshape was an enchanted armor. It had the qualities of a +3 hide armor and provided one more ability to those who had the ability to wild shape, Such people could change their forms into those of dragons of halfling to human size. This shapechange caused no drain on the wearers ability to shapechange by means of his or her wild shape ability.\n* Aerosclughpalar owned an armor of dragonshape as part of his own hoard."
