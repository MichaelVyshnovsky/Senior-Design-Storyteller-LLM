'''Shadowdark ale''' was an [[ale]] brewed in [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] with a dark brown cloudy bubbling appearance and a yellow foamy head.

==Description==
It had a light, bitter taste.

==Prices==
* Hand keg for 17 [[cp]]
* A barrel for 35 [[sp]]
* Cask for 1 [[gp]]
* A [[butt]] for 9 gp
* A [[tun]] for 18 gp.

==History==
It was first served at the [[Old Skull Inn]] but was later sold in many areas of [[Faer√ªn]], [[The Silver Taproom]] in [[Essembra]], and even the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. The [[Friendly Arm]] inn on the Sword Coast and the [[Nashkel Inn]] in [[Amn]] served Shadowdark for a single [[gold]] [[coin]].

[[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] purchased a pitcher of Shadowdark for himself, [[Bortas]], [[Rob]], and [[Will]] at the [[Swamp Rat]] tavern in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], on [[Eleint 17]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. It was the most expensive drink at the Swamp Rat. Among other places in Cormyr where one could buy a frothy tankard of  Shadowdark was [[Marsember]]'s [[The Wight on a Waterdragon]].
