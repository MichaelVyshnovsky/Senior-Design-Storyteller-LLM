A '''rope set''' was a tool in the Realms used to climb surfaces.

==Description==
Rope sets included a variety of grapples and [[pulley]]s with {{SI|600|ft|long=yes}} of [[elf|elven]]-made triple-stranded [[silk]] [[rope]]. A set weighed only {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}}.

==History==
Rope sets were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 40 [[gold piece]]s and included a [[satchel]].

==Notable Users==
* Rope sets were favored by [[thieves]] or [[rogues]] to aid them in scaling walls.
