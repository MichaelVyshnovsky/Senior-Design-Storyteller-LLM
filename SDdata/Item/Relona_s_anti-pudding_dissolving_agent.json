        "mainbody": "'''''Relona's Anti-Pudding Dissolving Agent''''' was a [[magic]]al substance developed to weaken elder [[black pudding]]s developed by [[Relona]] of [[Relona's Potions]] in [[Luskan]] ''circa'' [[1490 DR]].",
        "Powers": "Bright blue in color, ''Relona's anti-pudding dissolving agent'' dissolved thick aged material off an elder black pudding's body on contract, making it vulnerable.\n\nRelona strongly encouraged her customers not to ingest this potion.",
        "History": "''Circa'' 1490 DR, a notoriously dangerous elder black pudding took residence in the noxious cave that served as the exit drain of [[Luskan/Sewers|Luskan's sewers]]. The elder was so old its body became too thick and aged to be damaged with any weapons or magic. Relona of Relona's Potions enrolled the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]]'s aid in collecting samples of [[ooze]]s and [[jelly|jellies]] that lived in the city's sewers. She used the samples to develop ''Relona's anti-pudding dissolving agent''. The agent worked flawlessly, eating away at the elder pudding's aged armor, making it vulnerable and letting the Champion of the Burning Dawn exterminate the giant terrifying ooze."
