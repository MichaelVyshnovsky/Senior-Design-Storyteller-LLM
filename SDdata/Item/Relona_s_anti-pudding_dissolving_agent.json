        "mainbody": "elonas Anti-Pudding Dissolving Agent was a magical substance developed to weaken elder black puddings developed by Relona of Relonas Potions in Luskan circa 1490 DR.\nBright blue in color, Relonas anti-pudding dissolving agent dissolved thick aged material off an elder black puddings body on contract, making it vulnerable.\nRelona strongly encouraged her customers not to ingest this potion.\nCirca 1490 DR, a notoriously dangerous elder black pudding took residence in the noxious cave that served as the exit drain of Luskans sewers. The elder was so old its body became too thick and aged to be damaged with any weapons or magic. Relona of Relonas Potions enrolled the Champion of the Burning Dawns aid in collecting samples of oozes and jellies that lived in the citys sewers. She used the samples to develop Relonas anti-pudding dissolving agent. The agent worked flawlessly, eating away at the elder puddings aged armor, making it vulnerable and letting the Champion of the Burning Dawn exterminate the giant terrifying ooze."
