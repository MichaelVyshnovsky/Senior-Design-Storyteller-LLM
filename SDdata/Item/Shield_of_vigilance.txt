A shield of vigilance was a large magical steel shield adorned with a symbol of Torm. The wielder of a shield of vigilance could sheath it in electricity, causing injury to foes bashed with the shield. Although a relatively common magical item, it was worth around 9000 gold pieces. A more powerful version of shield of vigilance was rumored to exist, able to reflect all electricity.
