Dragonchess was a three-dimensional variant of chess found on Oerth and Toril.
Dragonchess was played on a three-tiered checkered board twelve squares wide and eight squares deep, using eighty-four pieces of thirteen types Sylphs, Griffons, Dragons, Warriors, Oliphants, Unicorns, Heroes, Thieves, Clerics, Mages, Kings, Paladins, Dwarves, Basilisks, and Elementals. Half the pieces are golden, and half are crimson.
The upper board represented the air, the middle board represented the land, and the lower board represented underground, collectively forming a three-dimensional battlefield. These boards were generally colored light blue and white for the upper board, light green and amber for the middle board, and red and brown for the lower board.
The game was set up with all gold pieces on one side, and all crimson pieces on the other side.
As with regular chess, the goal of the game was to checkmate the opposing players king. Gold always went first.
Some pieces could only stay on the board they started on, whereas other pieces could move between boards. Pieces had different movement rules depending on what level they were on. Otherwise, gameplay was similar to that of chess, with players having to strategize to corner the opposing players king while protecting their own.
