Watcher was a magic greatsword that was passed down in the Marsemban Kenric family for generations, belonging most recently to the chosen of Helm, Kleef Kenric during the events of the Second Sundering. Kleef carried Watcher in its scabbard over his back.

It had a unique design set upon its crossguard, a blue agate set within and surrounded by the etching of a large eye, which together resembled the eye of Helm. Fittingly, this jewel was referred to as Helms Eye.
Watchers blade was inscribed with a number of runes that read "Stay True and so Will Your Steel".
When the sword wielded by a member of the Kenric family, it felt as light as a mere dagger and had the sharpness to cleave oak shields and steel armor.
The Helms Eye jewel shone with a bright blue cone radiance whenever in the presence of the Shadovar, dispelling the darkness.
Distant allies of the wielder might be compelled by the illumination of Helms Eye to heroically aid guardianship with or follow orders of the wielder.
Watcher had been in the possession of the Kenric family since the midâˆ’14 century DR, when Lord Ildool governed the city of Marsember. The powers within Helms Eye appeared during the late-15th century DR when Watcher was in the presence of the Eye of Gruumsh.
