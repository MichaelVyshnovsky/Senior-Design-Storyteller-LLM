'''''Watcher''''' was a [[magic]] [[greatsword]] that was passed down in the [[Marsember|Marsemban]] Kenric family for generations, belonging most recently to the [[chosen]] of [[Helm]], [[Kleef Kenric]] during the events of the [[Second Sundering]]. Kleef carried ''Watcher'' in its scabbard over his back.

==Description==
[[File:Champion.png|left|thumb|''Watcher'', Complete, Pre-Miscolored Agate]]
It had a unique design set upon its crossguard, a [[agate|blue agate]] set within and surrounded by the etching of a large eye, which together resembled the eye of Helm. Fittingly, this jewel was referred to as ''Helm's Eye''.

''Watcher's'' blade was inscribed with a number of [[rune]]s that read: ''"Stay True and so Will Your Steel"''.

==Powers==
When the sword wielded by a member of the Kenric family, it felt as light as a mere [[dagger]] and had the sharpness to cleave [[oak]] [[Shield|shields]] and [[steel]] [[armor]].

The ''Helm's Eye'' jewel shone with a bright blue cone [[Radiance of the dawn|radiance]] whenever in the presence of the [[Shadovar]], dispelling the darkness.

Distant allies of the wielder might be [[Dominate person|compelled]] by the illumination of ''Helm's Eye'' to [[Heroism|heroically]] aid guardianship with or follow orders of the wielder.<ref>

==History==
''Watcher'' had been in the possession of the Kenric family since the midâˆ’14{{th}} century [[DR]], when [[Ildool|Lord Ildool]] governed the city of [[Marsember]]. The powers within ''Helm's Eye'' appeared during the late-15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]] when ''Watcher'' was in the presence of the [[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|''Eye of Gruumsh'']].
