'''''Sure striking short swords''''' were [[short sword]]s enhanced with the ''[[sure striking]] [[enchantment]]''.

==Description==
''Sure striking short swords'' varied in design and all appeared to be quite simple double-edged pointed blades, not much bigger than a [[dagger]] â€“ {{SI|2'0|'"|long=yes}} long.

==Powers==
The enchantments placed on the swords made them dramatically easier to wield and land a strike on a target. Even though their damage potential was in line with a simple ''+1'' enchantment, their magically enchanted aim was comparable to a powerful ''+5'' enchantment.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, one such sword was carried by [[Artemus]] of [[Shaengarne Ford]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. His home was ransacked and broken into building materials by the [[orc]] invaders of the [[Broken Tusk Clan]] that took his village hostage. However, Arte's stock remained unmolested as orcs failed to find the storage cellar of his shop where the ''sure striking short sword'' could be found, along with several less valuable items and enchanted ''+1 [[throwing hammer]]'' and a magical ''+1 [[flail]]''.
