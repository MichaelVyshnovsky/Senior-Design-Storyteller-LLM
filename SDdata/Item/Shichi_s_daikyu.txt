'''''Shichi's daikyu''''' was the magical [[daikyu]] (great bow) of [[Shichi No Ken]], a [[paladin]] of [[Amaterasu]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
It was a ''+2 daikyu''. Designed for Shichi's size and strength, only archers with great strength could draw it far enough to take advantage of its accuracy and power; others would have to rest for a number of minutes or not use it at all. In addition, twice a day, an arrow loosed from it could fly unerringly and strike with maximum impact.

==History==
Along with [[Shichi's katana|a katana]], the daikyu was enchanted and gifted to Shichi by the Grand Master of Flowers when she departed the [[Seven Roses Monastery]] in [[Pe Nok]] to become a "walking initiate".
