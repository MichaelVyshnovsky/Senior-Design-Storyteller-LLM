        "mainbody": "Belaying pins were a type of mariners tool.\nthumb|273px|A diagram of how rope was typically fastened around a belaying pin.\nBelaying pins were short rods of wood or metal that were inserted into holes bored through a ships rail. The rigging lines of a ship would be fastened to them. They were usually found in rows, bringing a series of ropes together to one location. Alternatively, sailors would use belaying pins as a place to store their unused ropes.\nBeyond their primary purpose, belaying pins could be yanked free and used as an improvised club. Typically this occurred during boarding actions at sea, when no other weapons were in reach\nBelaying pins could be found on practically any ship. They were typically available for purchase at seaside towns or cities, particularly from shipbuilders, warehouses, or businesses that supplied ships.\nIn the port city Athkatla for example, the market Waukeens Promenade sold belaying pins alongside other nautical equipment.For Duty & Deity states that every nonmagical item featured in the Arms and Equipment Guide can be purchased at Waukeens Promenade.\n* These were often wielded by sea zombies.\n* Belaying pins were a favored weapon among mariners of Evermeet.\n* Belaying pins were a common improvised weapon among pirates, such as those who lived in Immurks Hold.\n* Belaying pins were a common improvised weapon among press gangs, such as those that worked for the Zhentarim.\n* Brekar Lotala, the Station Commander of the Citadel of Immurks Hold, owned a belaying pin +1.\n* Paron, a former sailor and owner of the Struggling Squid inn in Tantras, typically carried around a belaying pin.\n* Talton, a scrimshaw artist in Ravens Bluff, owned a belaying pin +3."
