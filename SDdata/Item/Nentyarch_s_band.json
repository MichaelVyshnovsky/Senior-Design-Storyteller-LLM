        "mainbody": "'''''Nentyarch's band''''' was an [[enchanted]] [[druid]]ic band that bore the markings of the [[Nentyarch]] from the [[Circle of Leth]].",
        "Description": "The [[ring]] was decorated with three concentric circles – the mark of the Circle of Leth of [[Rawlinswood]]. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Nentyarch's band'' showed its age and decay from exposure to elements.",
        "Powers": "''Nentyarch's band's'' magics were tailored to empowers [[summoning]] [[spell]]s of druids and [[shaman]]s. It gave them the capacity to access additional divine magic spells per day and dramatically fortified their wisdom. Additionally, the wearer of the ring gained the ability to cast the ''[[banishment]]'' as if conjured by a powerful spellslinger once per day.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, ''Nentyarch's band'' showed the decay of at least several decades of exposure. Its history was unknown; however, its markings clearly indicated the ring's origin. In 1374 DR, the ring belonged to a powerful trio of ancient [[bear]] [[Telthor]]s of the [[Wells of Lurue]] in [[Rashemen]] – [[Wotomo]], [[Jabar]], and [[Kuma]]. All three were ancestors of the Bear God and companion of [[Kalach-Cha]] – [[Okku]]."
