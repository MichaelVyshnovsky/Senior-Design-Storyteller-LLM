        "mainbody": "he sickle of careful kindness was a unique enchanted sickle crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Pikel Bouldershoulder in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called \"Silverhand gear\" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.\nThe blade was especially sharp and it could be swung with great speed and surety.\nThe sickle of careful kindness was able to clear and bestow blight. An injury from the sickle had a chance of being grievously terrible and resistant to even magical healing, however it would only allow this if it acknowledged the judgment of its wielder to recognize danger.\n* Pikel, a dwarf druid to whom Silverhand also gifted the seal of devotion."
