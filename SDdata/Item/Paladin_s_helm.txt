'''''Paladin's helms''''' were, as the name suggested, [[enchanted]] [[helmet]]s favored by [[paladin]]s. They could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
A ''paladin's helm'' had a protective enchantment that rewarded wearers who put themselves in danger to save others. If a paladin drew the attention of their foes away from their allies, the ''helm'' gave them the benefits of a ''[[shield of faith]]'' spell.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Nayeli Goldflower]], a [[human]] paladin of [[Tyr]] who worked as an [[adventurer]] on behalf of [[Laeral Silverhand]], the [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
