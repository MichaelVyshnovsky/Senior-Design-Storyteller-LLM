'''''Stone salve''''' was a magical ointment that could either cure petrification or apply a stone-skinned protection.

==Effects==
If one ounce was rubbed over a being that had been [[petrified]], then ''stone salve'' restored them as with a ''[[stone to flesh]]'' spell. If they were already flesh, then it turned their skin stony for a short period, protecting them as with a ''[[stoneskin]]'' spell.

==Cost==
The expensive ''stone salve'' cost 4000 [[gold piece]]s per ounce (28.3495 grams).

==Notable Owners==
* [[Isti-Zar]]
* [[Jezz the Lame]], one of the leaders of [[House Jaelre]], possessed two [[vial]]s of ''stone salve''.<ref>
* [[Orielden]], a guard in the [[House of Night]], kept a small jar of ''stone salve'' underneath his bunk in the temple.<ref>
