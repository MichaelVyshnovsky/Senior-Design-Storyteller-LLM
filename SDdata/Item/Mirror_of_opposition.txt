'''''Mirrors of opposition''''' were a type of [[enchanted]] [[mirror]] with a duplicative effect.

==Powers==
Whenever a creature was reflected in a ''mirror of opposition'', it would conjure a duplicate of them that sought to kill the original creature. These duplicates were exact, possessing the same items and powers as the original, including those of a magical nature. If destroyed they would disappear alongside their duplicated belongings. Destroying a duplicate's original also had the same outcome.

==History==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the first level of [[Undermountain]] had a hall of mirrors in which a ''mirror of opposition'' was installed.

In [[1368 DR]], a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes|adj=square}} ''mirror of opposition'' hung within the the [[Blue Alley]].

==Notable Owners==
* [[Dimwold]] possessed one that he stole from the [[balor]] [[Ter-soth]].
* Within [[Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim]]'s [[Castle of Illusion]], there was a hall of mirrors in which both a ''mirror of opposition'' and a ''[[mirror of life trapping]]'' were installed.
