        "mainbody": "The '''''Shard of the Samarlogh''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] [[Batiri]] [[shortsword]] wielded by the chieftains of the [[Stone Knives tribe]] of [[Samarach]].",
        "Powers": "''The Shard'' was a crude \"shortsword\" fashioned out of a sizable chip off the boulder known as the Heart of the [[Samarlogh]]. The weapon possessed a ''+1'' enchantment and dealt additional [[positive energy]] damage to its target â€“ the remnants of the Heart of the Samarlogh's magic. Additionally, because of its crude form, the ''Shard of the Samarlogh'' dealt additional bludgeoning damage on top of regular piercing damage done by other similar [[sword]]s.",
        "History": "Long before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[goblin]]s of the Stone Knives tribe in [[Samarach]] created the ''Shard of the Samarlogh'' and the weapon became the mystical symbol of rulership and the tribe's namesake. The weapon was wielded by every chieftain of the tribe, and it was believed that if the weapon was ever to leave the Stone Knives' possession, the tribe was to be fully destroyed."
