        "mainbody": "The Shard of the Samarlogh was a unique enchanted Batiri shortsword wielded by the chieftains of the Stone Knives tribe of Samarach.\nThe Shard was a crude \"shortsword\" fashioned out of a sizable chip off the boulder known as the Heart of the Samarlogh. The weapon possessed a +1 enchantment and dealt additional positive energy damage to its target â€“ the remnants of the Heart of the Samarloghs magic. Additionally, because of its crude form, the Shard of the Samarlogh dealt additional bludgeoning damage on top of regular piercing damage done by other similar swords.\nLong before the , goblins of the Stone Knives tribe in Samarach created the Shard of the Samarlogh and the weapon became the mystical symbol of rulership and the tribes namesake. The weapon was wielded by every chieftain of the tribe, and it was believed that if the weapon was ever to leave the Stone Knives possession, the tribe was to be fully destroyed."
