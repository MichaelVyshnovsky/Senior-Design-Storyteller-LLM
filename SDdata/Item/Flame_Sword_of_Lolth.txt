The '''''Flame Sword of Lolth''''', sometimes simply referred to as the '''''Flame Sword''''', was a powerful artifact that served [[Lolth]] during the [[War of the Seldarine]].

==Description==
The ''Flame Sword'' was an elegantly sinister blade of dark purple metal. Its blade was created to resemble raging fire, and it was decorated with a white skull-like design on the blade's base close to the handle. The ''Blade'' radiated powerful [[divine]] magic and, created flames of regular or purple hue.

==Powers==
The full extent of the artifact's powers remained undocumented. It was not just used for its sheer destructive power when wielded as a weapon, but also as a tool that could cut through the planes, opening ''[[gate]]s'' and giving the owner of the blade the power of controlling the beings that poured out of its portals.

The magics of the ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' were locked behind its one vulnerability, the ''spider statue'', that allowed the harnessing of its divine powers.

==History==
The ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' first appeared during the War of the Seldarine, created by Lolth, known as Araushnee at the time. She used the ''Flame Sword'' against her fellow gods and elves until an unnamed brave elven hero stole the ''spider statue'', holy to the goddess, and shattered it into eight pieces. With the sword losing much of its power, it was taken from the defeated Spider Queen and hidden away by the [[Seldarine]].

Subsequently, the ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' and the ''spider pieces'' fell into [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s hands and the Mad Mage, well-familiar with the item, its power, and its mistress, hid the sword in a vault, deep in [[Undermountain]]. The vault's access was locked behind the mechanism that needed all the ''spider pieces'' to be assembled. Halaster scattered the ''pieces'' throughout his mega-dungeon to make sure they never to get found by the followers of the Spider Queen.

With the Mad Mage's disappearance from Undermountain during the Halaster's Higharvestide in [[1369 DR]], Lolth seized it as an opportunity to send one of her High Priestesses, Matron Mother [[Azurna]] into the dungeon under [[Waterdeep]] in search of the blade and the keys to its power. By [[1370 DR]], Azurna built an alliance among various shadowy enemies of the City of Splendor, collecting the pieces of the ''spider statue'' and uncovering the location of the vault. Even though Halaster returned to his lair, he elected not to waste his efforts on the [[drow]] forces within his dungeon, knowing that [[Khelben Arunsun]] would've eventually sent an "exterminator" to deal with the infestation. With Azurna collecting several ''pieces'', some of the powers of the ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' were tapped into and opened ''gates'' in Undermountain, increasing the presence of extraplanar creatures within. Eventually, that led to Khelben contracting an adventurer and sending him on the expeditions into the dungeon. Subsequently, the [[Khelbenite]] collected the remaining ''spider pieces'' and confronted Azurna within the vault. The ''spider statue'' was assembled, unlocking the ''Flame Sword of Lolth''. The artifact called for its mistress and opened an extraplanar gate for the Spider Queen to send her [[avatar]] through. After a long and deadly battle, the avatar of Lolth was defeated, and in the ensuing explosion of magical energy, both the ''Flame Sword of Lolth'' and the ''spider statue'' were nowhere to be seen.
