A '''''belt of dwarvenkind''''', also known as a '''''girdle of dwarvenkind''''' or a '''''girdle of the dwarves''''', was a [[belt]] that bestowed [[dwarf]]-like qualities upon the wearer. 

==Description==
''Belts of dwarvenkind'' were often presented as a gift to individuals who earned friendship or done a great deed for a dwarvish community. They were never earned with ease, as it usually took decades to achieve enough respect among the dwarves. Because of that the ''belts of dwarvenkind'' were rarely seen in the hands of [[human]]s, and when humans were seen wearing one of these enchanted belts, it was very likely gained via nefarious means.

==Powers==
These accessories bestowed robustness upon whomever equipped them, so that they were capable of enduring difficult conditions. The belts made the wearers more charismatic around dwarves. 

Often, these belts made the wearer less charismatic around other races. However, some types of ''belts of dwarvenkind'' did not only make the wearer more charming to dwarves, but also other stout folk, such as [[stout halfling]]s and [[gnomes]].

Due to the powerful [[dweomer]] of this girdle, the wearer could even speak, read, and understand the [[Dwarven]] language. As well as this, those who equipped the belt gained [[darkvision]], and could determine how deep the ground beneath them was, as dwarves could. They would also gain resistance to [[poison]] and other effects. 

In addition, they might also grow a grand beard, or a grander beard if they already had one.

==History==
One of these girdles was stored in the [[Tilverton]] mines in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
