Devas Bile was a type of dangerous alcohol created in the Abyssal city of Samora, on the layer of Azzagrat.
Devas Bile was a rare fiendish drink. It was hard to find outside Samoras breweries. The concoction was deadly to those from the Prime Material plane and for some lucky mortal imbibers â€“ survivable but poisonous. Those who survived consuming Devas Bile went into a roaring drunk rage and, eventually, succumbed to violent illness.
