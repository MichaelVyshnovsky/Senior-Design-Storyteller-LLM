'''''Reason's Grasp''''' was a unique pair of [[glove]]s that bolstered the end of a [[Barbarian#rage|rage]] that [[barbarian]]s and [[berserker]]s could incite in themselves.

==Description==
The gloves were especially firm and had a snug fit. They felt uncomfortable whenever the wearer attempted to make a fist, and more pleasant when they kept an open hand.

==Powers==
The gloves allowed an individual to bolster their own vitality when they came out of their rage.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the gloves could be found in a tollhouse found along the [[Risen Road]].
