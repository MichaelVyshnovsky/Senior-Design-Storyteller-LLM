'''''Peredus the Great''''' was a popular ballad about the life and death of the adventuring hero known as [[Peredus]] who perished not far from the city of [[Daggerford]].

==Contents==
The ballad birthed some speculations about the place of the hero's death and his alleged magical blade that perished alongside its master. This led to the particular passage about the well and Peredus' post-mortem fate to be favorite among amateur archeologists.

==Lyrics==
{{quote|Peredus the Glorius,<br/>His stature quite impervious,<br/>Aside a well stood standing thus,<br/>Without a hint of wariness.<br/><br/>Standing full of watchfulness,<br/>Eldritch [[sword]] in readiness,<br/>Great defender Peredus,<br/>Would save us from the villainous.<br/><br/>Bandits struck with heinousness,<br/>Scales and hides of fearlessness,<br/>Fear them not did Peredus,<br/>Stepped forward in defense of us.<br/><br/>Our caravan in exodus,<br/>Fled the site so dangerous,<br/>While great defender Peredus,<br/>Fought bandits who had ambushed us.<br/><br/>The bandits were too numerous,<br/>They overwhelmed great Peredus,<br/>With woulds to his mortalness,<br/>And knowing of their gustibus,<br/><br/>He cast himself into darkness,<br/>He cast himself into darkness...|Lyrics of the ''Peredus the Great'' as performed by [[Jorey Fontalas]]}}

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the song could be heard in the [[Happy Cow]] tavern of Daggerford, performed by Jorey Fontalas. The same year, a shady adventurer named [[Burnas Tellrot]] theorized that the well from the ballad was located in the [[Wild Pastures]] outside fo the city and sought the aid of [[Hero of Daggerford]] in retrieval of the "Eldritch sword" that belonged to the folk hero.

By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, lyrics and music sheet for ''Peredus the Great'' was available in a book, simply titled ''[[Sword Coast Songbook]]'', a collection of songs compiled by [[Silke Rosena]] sometime before her death in the 14{{th}} century DR. Copies of ''Sword Coast Songbook'' were found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].
