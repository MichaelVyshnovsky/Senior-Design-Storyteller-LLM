The '''plate of the dark''' was a set of [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[full plate|full plate mail]] armor that was worn by the [[undead]] warlord of [[Bane]], Dark Lord [[Hertious]].

==Description==
The armor possessed a ''+1 enchantment''.

==History==
This suit of armor was work by Hertious for over five centuries while he dwelled within a castle in the [[Earthfast Mountains]]. It was unknown how the ''plate of the dark'' was seperated by its own, but eventually the armor was moved to other realms across [[Faerûn]].

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it came into the possession of [[Tamoko]], the follower and lover of the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok]].

Dark Lord Hertiuos, undead Warlord of Bane, wore this piece of armor over more than 500 years. During this time he was rumored to dwell in a castle somewhere within the Earthfast Mountains. How his armor moved to other lands without him is not certain, though the seperation of the two was surely unpleasant.
