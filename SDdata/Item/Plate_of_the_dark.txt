The plate of the dark was a set of enchanted full plate mail armor that was worn by the undead warlord of Bane, Dark Lord Hertious.
The armor possessed a +1 enchantment.
This suit of armor was work by Hertious for over five centuries while he dwelled within a castle in the Earthfast Mountains. It was unknown how the plate of the dark was seperated by its own, but eventually the armor was moved to other realms across Faer√ªn.
By the 14 century DR, it came into the possession of Tamoko, the follower and lover of the Bhaalspawn Sarevok.
Dark Lord Hertiuos, undead Warlord of Bane, wore this piece of armor over more than 500 years. During this time he was rumored to dwell in a castle somewhere within the Earthfast Mountains. How his armor moved to other lands without him is not certain, though the seperation of the two was surely unpleasant.
