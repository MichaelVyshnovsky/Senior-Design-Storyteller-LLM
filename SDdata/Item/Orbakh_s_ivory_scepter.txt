Orbakhs ivory scepter was a powerful enchanted rod that belonged to Orbakh one of the necromancers from ancient Myth Drannor. This sceptred possessed magics powerful enough to destroy a lich or dracolich phylactery.
Orbakhs ivory scepter was a short and stout staff carved out of elephant ivory. The wand was topped with a small ivory skull.
This scepter was a magical item imbued with inherently evil magic which drained strength of any goodly creature who attempted to wield it. This effect, however, was not permanent and was instantaneously reversed once a goodly creature let Orbakhs ivory scepter go.
The scepter stored several powerful spells allowing its wielder to discharge them at will. Each used spell exhausted one or several charges. These spells were detect undead which costed 1 charge, disrupt undead - 1 charge, shatter - 2 charges, halt undead - 2 charges, and vampiric touch 2 charges up. When the wand was recovered from its original owners tomb it did not possess its full power and only held 41 charges.
Long before Myth Drannor was destroyed in the Weeping War, this ivory scepter was wielded by Orbakh of the Tower of Bones that stood on Polyandrium of the City of Song. When the necromancer reached old age he unsuccessfully attempted to reach lichdom and perished in the process. He was interred inside the Crypt of Orbakh and his scepter was laid to rest with its master.
Orbakhs ivory scepter resurfaced in 1369 DR. A group of heroes set against the Cult of the Dragon that occupied the ruined city that year attempting to sow destruction via corruption of a pool of radiance. The adventurers were guided by a baelnorn, Molostroi, to recover the ivory scepter in order to destroy Cults dracolich Pelendralaar and his phylactery. This act eventually aided in Pelendralaars destruction at the hands of the Veiled Ones.
