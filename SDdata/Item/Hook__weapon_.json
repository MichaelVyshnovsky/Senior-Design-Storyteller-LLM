        "Powers": "''Hook'' was enhanced with a ''+1'' enchantment and magically gave the wielder skills to handle two weapons in both hands in battle. Additionally, the rapier improved the wielder's ability to parry incoming strikes.",
        "History": "Haman, better known for his nickname, \"the Shadow,\" was a feared assassin in service of the Night Masks. He was well known ho wielding his two blades, ''Hook'' and [[dagger]] called ''[[Skinner]]'', to strike down his targets and disappear back into the shadows. Reportedly, he was also a capable duelist. Haman's favorite battle stance was with ''Hook'' in his right hand and the dagger in the left. The rapier guided his opponents into ''Skinner's'' range to meet their demise.\n\nIn 1374 DR, Haman worked for the corrupt owner of [[the Track]] in Westgate. The Shadow protected [[Mordecai]] with his ''Hook'' and ''Skinner'' while representing the Night Masks and dealing with the businessman."
