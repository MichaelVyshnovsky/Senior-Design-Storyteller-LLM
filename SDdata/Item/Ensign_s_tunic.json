        "History": "Traditionally, ensigns were the lowers ranking commissioned officers in land military forces. However, as of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''ensign's tunics'' were given out to the pirates who were the first to act on buccaneer vessels of the [[Sea of Swords]]. These \"red shirts\" were first to be sent off docked vessels into the unknown, first to be tasked with opening potentially deadly-trapped treasure chests."
