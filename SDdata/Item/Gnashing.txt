Gnashing was a quality that could be applied to armor that would cause it to bite any creature who attempted to wrestle, or pin down, its wearer.
Armor that had been enchanted with this quality would appear with many faces, often with cruel and vicious expressions, carved into its surface. These were often modeled to look like various fiends and similar creatures.
Suits crafted in the Nelanther Isles featured images of reavers and ogres.
The first gnashing armor was crafted by the cleric Ferstal, a worshiper of Tiamat whose personal suit was crafted with the visage of dragons heads.
