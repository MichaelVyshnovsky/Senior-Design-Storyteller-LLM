        "Powers": "Anyone who received an injury from a ''diseased'' weapon was at risk of instantly contracting [[filth fever]], and manifesting symptoms without any incubation period. The disease itself was not [[magical]], so the afflicted creature could recover from it naturally.",
        "Creation": "Crafting a ''diseased'' weapon required not only the skills to [[Item enchantment|create magic weapons]], but also access to the ''[[contagion]]'' spell.",
        "History": "During the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''diseased'' weapons were sometimes wielded by the [[Talontar]] [[blightlord]]s of the [[Unapproachable East]], They were also utilized by some of the more sinister [[Red Wizard]]s of [[Thay]], who gave such weapons to their minions."
