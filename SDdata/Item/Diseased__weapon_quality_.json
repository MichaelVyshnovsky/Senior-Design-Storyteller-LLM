        "mainbody": "Diseased was an enchantment that caused a weapon to inflict a wasting disease.\nAnyone who received an injury from a diseased weapon was at risk of instantly contracting filth fever, and manifesting symptoms without any incubation period. The disease itself was not magical, so the afflicted creature could recover from it naturally.\nCrafting a diseased weapon required not only the skills to create magic weapons, but also access to the contagion spell.\nDuring the late 14 century DR, diseased weapons were sometimes wielded by the Talontar blightlords of the Unapproachable East, They were also utilized by some of the more sinister Red Wizards of Thay, who gave such weapons to their minions."
