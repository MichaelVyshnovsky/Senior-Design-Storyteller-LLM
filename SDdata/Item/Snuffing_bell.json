        "mainbody": "A '''snuffing bell''', or '''candle snuffer''', was a tool designed for snuffing out [[candle]]s.",
        "Description": "The name of this tool derived from the fact that the part placed upon candles to douse them resembled a [[bell]]. They sometimes had rods that measured {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} in length and weighed {{SI|4|lb|k|long=yes}}. Some held an oiled wick at their tip, for use in lighting candles, [[oil]], or other flammables.\n\nSnuffing bells were only suitable for putting out the flame of a candle, nothing larger, and generally could not douse flames that were [[magic]]al in nature, unless otherwise noted. For example, the magical candles of [[Istishian]] [[mystic]]s could be doused with a snuffer.<ref>",
        "Availability": "* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold a long-rod variant of snuffing bell in their \"Priests' Alcove\" section, large enough to snuff out even the largest of altar candles and holding an oiled wick at its tip. Uniquely, between the bell and wick there was a blade, allowing for the tool to be used as a weapon."
