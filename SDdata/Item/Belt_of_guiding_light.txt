Belts of guiding light were magic belts favored by adventurers and explorers that were said to be blessed by Savras himself.
Belts of guiding light came in three enchantment strength levels lesser, normal, and greater. Lesser belts of guiding light granter the wearer immunity to fear, improved their knowledge of lore, and glowed with purple light to a  radius. Normal belts of guiding light were enchanted to make the wearer immune to death magic, and glowed with blue dim light to a  radius. The most powerful version, greater belts of guiding light, granted both immunities against fear and death magic, glowed with purple light to a , and improved the wearers sensitivity to sound, their knowledge of lore, and their ability to search, investigate, and spot important details.
One of the most notable owners of a belt of guiding light was Polt Henrikson, a follower of Savras. During one of his adventures he got lost in the Underdark and prayed to his god for guidance. Savras responded by manifesting one of these enchanted belts around Polts waist. The magical item gave Polt much needed illumination in the darkness of the Underdark as well as knowledge and confidence to rescue himself. This event subsequently led Polt Henrikson to become an influential person among the faithful of Savras and the Church of Savras to gain popularity.
