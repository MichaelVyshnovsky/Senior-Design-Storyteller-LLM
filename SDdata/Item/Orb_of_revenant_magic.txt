An orb of revenant magic was a type of enchanted orb that could erase certain failures of its weirder.
Orbs of revenant magic were spellcasting implements that enhanced the lethal effectiveness of arcane and psionic powers. In addition, if the wielder were to miss their foes with such a power, they could call upon the orb once each day to regain their spent energies.
