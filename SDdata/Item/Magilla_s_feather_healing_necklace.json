        "mainbody": "'''''Magilla's feather healing necklace''''' was an [[enchanted]] feather jewelry that contained healing magics crafted by [[Magilla]], an aged [[saru]] [[shaman]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This magic necklace was assembled on a [[leather]] cord that had five large blue [[parrot]] feathers affixed to it.",
        "Powers": "Each of the necklace's feathers was enchanted to dispense healing magic when removed from the necklace and touched a creature.",
        "History": "In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, the saru village, Magilla's home, fell under a wasting curse placed on it by a vain [[earth spirit]] of the Living Jungle named [[Ligela]]. The spirit was quelled by a group of adventuring tribesfolk, saving the lives of suffering saru. Magilla enchanted several items as a gift for the saviors. ''Magilla's feather healing necklace'' was among the magic items created by the shaman for the heroes."
