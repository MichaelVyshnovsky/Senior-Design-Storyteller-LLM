        "mainbody": "Boots of the sahuagin were enchanted boots worn by sailors and pirates of the Nelanther Isles and the Sea of Swords.\nDespite their name, boots of the sahuagin were not crafted by sahuagin and were very obviously manmade. These boots were well-made and sewn out of water-resisting material that made them quite popular among fishers and sailors. The minor enchantment that was placed on these boots increased the wearers fortitude.\nThese sailors boots were in common use in the late-14 century DR. Notably, Captain Allendry of the Midnight Rose outfitted his crew and offered the boots for sale."
