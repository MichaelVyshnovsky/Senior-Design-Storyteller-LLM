Every use of the wands power caused it to be drained of one charge. If it was drained completely, the wand turned into vapor. It was impossible to recharge a wand of acidic spheres.\nThe power of the wand was to shoot an orb of acid in a straight line from the tip this ability could be used once per minute. This acid remained for three minutes and sank into anything. It never splashed because of this property.\nThe accuracy with which the ball of acid hit the target dropped with increasing range.\nOnly wizards could use a wand of acidic spheres.\nWands of acidic spheres were items associated with the drow."
