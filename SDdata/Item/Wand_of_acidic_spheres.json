        "mainbody": "A '''''wand of acidic spheres''''' was a [[magic]]al [[wand]] that shot orbs of [[acid]].",
        "Description": "''Wands of acidic spheres'' were made of smooth, plain wood and were 1 foot (0.3 meters) long.",
        "Powers": "A ''wand of acidic spheres'' had six to seventy-two charges on creation. Every use of the wand's power caused it to be drained of one charge. If it was drained completely, the wand turned into vapor. It was impossible to recharge a ''wand of acidic spheres''.\n\nThe power of the wand was to shoot an orb of acid in a straight line from the tip; this ability could be used once per minute. This acid remained for three minutes and sank into anything. It never splashed because of this property.\n\nThe accuracy with which the ball of acid hit the target dropped with increasing range.\n\nOnly [[wizard]]s could use a ''wand of acidic spheres''.",
        "History": "''Wands of acidic spheres'' were items associated with the [[drow]]."
