        "mainbody": "A carpet of fighting was a magic item originating in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nCarpets of fighting were available in many beautiful or mundane variations.\nThese rugs acted like rugs of smothering but were activated by a command word spoken by the owner of the rug. Upon speaking the command word, a carpet of fighting would wrap itself around a target of the owners choosing, causing the target to fall unconscious within minutes. Targets that did not breathe were not rendered unconscious but simply held by the carpet.\nOnce wrapped by the carpet, the target could only escape if they possessed immense strength, if the owners willed it, or if a hold plant, animate object, or a wish spell was used. Any attacks made upon the carpet while it held its target also damaged the target."
