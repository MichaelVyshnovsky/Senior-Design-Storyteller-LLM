Arrows of Ilmater were a variety of deceptively named arrows, enhcanted by a particularly devious cleric of Loviatar.
These missiles featured a three-pronged arrowhead made out of some manner of bone. Loviataran by craft, Arrows of Ilmater were ironically named for the reputation Ilmatari clerics had as altruistic healers who bestowed their services for folks across the Realms.

These arrows were imbued with necrotic energy. When they struck true, the arrows of Ilmater prevented a target from magical or mundane healing for several seconds.
These magic arrows could be found in select locales across the Sword Coast as of the late 15 century DR.
* Dammon, the tiefling smith from Elturel came across one of these arrows during his travels and offered it for sale to others.
