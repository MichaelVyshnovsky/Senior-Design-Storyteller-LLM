The seal of patience was a unique enchanted badge crafted by Laeral Silverhand for Tommus Tallstep in the late 15 century DR. It was one of many pieces of so-called "Silverhand gear" crafted for adventurers who helped to protect Waterdeep.
This polished badge was designed by Silverhand to remind Tommus of his years of training and to reinforce the defensive skills he picked up along the way.
Every time Tommus pressed the attack against his foes, there was a chance that the seal of patience would augment his defensive reflexes, allowing him to block almost any incoming attack.
* Tommus Tallstep, a halfling fighter to whom Silverhand also gifted the Captains Helmet and the axe of great cleaving.
