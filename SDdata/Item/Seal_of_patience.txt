The '''''seal of patience''''' was a unique [[enchanted]] badge crafted by [[Laeral Silverhand]] for [[Tommus Tallstep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of many pieces of so-called "[[Silverhand gear]]" crafted for [[adventurer]]s who helped to protect [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This polished badge was designed by Silverhand to remind Tommus of his years of training and to reinforce the defensive skills he picked up along the way.

==Powers==
Every time Tommus pressed the attack against his foes, there was a chance that the ''seal of patience'' would augment his defensive reflexes, allowing him to block almost any incoming attack.

==Notable Owners==
* Tommus Tallstep, a [[halfling]] [[fighter]] to whom Silverhand also gifted the ''[[Captain's Helmet]]'' and the ''[[axe of great cleaving]]''.
