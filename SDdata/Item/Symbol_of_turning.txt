A '''''symbol of turning''''' was a type of [[holy symbol]] that allowed one to cast ''[[turn undead]]'' as though they were a [[cleric]].{{Cite dragon/364/Ashen Covenant|44}}

==Powers==
''Symbols of turning'' allowed any [[divine spellcaster]] that could ''[[channel divinity]]'' to cast the cleric power of ''turn undead''. Any cleric that wielded a ''symbol of turning'' could invoke its power in addition to their own uses of ''turn undead''. These symbols also carried a small chance of inflicting [[radiant energy]] upon the [[undead]] they were used against.

These holy symbols ranged from having ''+1'' to ''+6'' enchantments and like any holy symbol they could be used as an [[implement]] in casting divine magic.

==History==
Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s operating in [[Tymanther]] were sent into an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site near [[Ruinspoke]] to recover [[Melnar]], a member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]] that had gone missing.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|4-5}}<ref group="note" name="Unther">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. While exploring a mausoleum in the area that was guarded by a skull enchanted with ''[[Skull Watch]]'', the adventurers came across a stone [[sarcophagus]] belonging to a [[Lathander]]ite named [[Jagress Dawnlion]]. Hidden beneath a false bottom in the sarcophagus the adventurers found a number of [[gold piece]]s, a ''+1 [[amulet of mental resolve|amulet of mental resolution]]'', and a ''+1 symbol of turning''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|15}}
