A '''''torque of the Goddess''''' was a [[magic]]al [[silver]] [[Torque|neck ring]] worn as a protective ornament by the [[Ffolk]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]], especially [[druid]]s.<ref name=Moon/><ref name=Her145><ref name=Hal44>

==Powers==
The torque when worn was equivalent to a ''+1'' or ''+2 [[ring of protection]]'', but this advantage could not be combined with other ''rings of protection''.<ref name=Moon/><ref name=Her145/><ref name=Hal44/>

It also granted significant benefits against [[lycanthrope]]s, preventing the wearer from contracting [[lycanthropy]] (though he or she could still be physically harmed when attacked by such creatures). The torque increased the wearer's striking and damaging potential against these monsters in combat, and also rendered the lycanthrope vulnerable to unarmed attacks.<ref name=Moon/><ref name=Her145/><ref name=Hal44/>

They could also be worn by animals including [[dog]]s, with the magical benefits gained.<ref name=Moon/><ref name=Her145/><ref name=Hal44/>

==Notable Owners==
A pair of these torques were worn by the druids [[Robyn Kendrick]]<ref name=Hal44/><ref name=Her104> and [[Genna Moonsinger]].<ref name=Hal88>

Another was worn by [[Canthus]], a [[moorhound]] belonging to [[Tristan Kendrick]].<ref name=Hal38>
