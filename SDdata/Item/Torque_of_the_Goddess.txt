A torque of the Goddess was a magical silver neck ring worn as a protective ornament by the Ffolk of the Moonshae Isles, especially druids.
The torque when worn was equivalent to a +1 or +2 ring of protection, but this advantage could not be combined with other rings of protection.
It also granted significant benefits against lycanthropes, preventing the wearer from contracting lycanthropy (though he or she could still be physically harmed when attacked by such creatures). The torque increased the wearers striking and damaging potential against these monsters in combat, and also rendered the lycanthrope vulnerable to unarmed attacks.
They could also be worn by animals including dogs, with the magical benefits gained.
A pair of these torques were worn by the druids Robyn Kendrick and Genna Moonsinger.
Another was worn by Canthus, a moorhound belonging to Tristan Kendrick.
