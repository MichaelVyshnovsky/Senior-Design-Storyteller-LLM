Serpent rings were magic items worn only by the most trusted servants of Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.
These rings were made from brass and designed to resemble a snake biting its own tail.
A serpent ring allowed the wearer to safely pass through any wards within one of Tiamats temples. The magic of the ring also identified the wearer as a servant of Tiamat so that serpent blades would not attack and protected the wearer from serpent blade venom while also making them more resistant to other poisons.
