'''''Serpent rings''''' were [[magic item]]s worn only by the most trusted servants of [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen within the [[Untheric pantheon]].

==Description==
These [[ring]]s were made from [[brass]] and designed to resemble a [[snake]] biting its own tail.

==Powers==
A ''serpent ring'' allowed the wearer to safely pass through any [[ward]]s within one of Tiamat's temples. The [[magic]] of the ring also identified the wearer as a servant of Tiamat so that [[serpent blade]]s would not attack and protected the wearer from ''serpent blade'' venom while also making them more resistant to other [[poison]]s.
