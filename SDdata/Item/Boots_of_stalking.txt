Boots of stalking were enchanted boots, invaluable to creatures in need of stealth.
These boots were soft and black-colored boots.
Boots of stalking allowed the wearer to activate their invisibility spell-like ability. Additionally, the boots increased the wearers movement speed. An average pair possessed three charges of the invisibility spell.
In 1369 DR, a pair of these night-black boots were in possession of a group of orog renegades in the Elven Catacombs, who rebelled against their kin and the Cult of the Dragon employees.
