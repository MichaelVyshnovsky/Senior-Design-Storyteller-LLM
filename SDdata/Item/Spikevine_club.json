        "mainbody": "pikevine clubs were enchanted clubs wielded by druids. They could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.\nTrue to the name, a spikevine club was a gnarled piece of wood covered in spikes and entwined by a thorny vine.\nAny who were struck by the club risked serious injury, but so too did their nearby allies. At unpredictable intervals, a spikevine club might lash out at nearby foes upon tasting the blood of an enemy.\n* Pikel Bouldershoulder, a dwarf druid."
