        "mainbody": "'''''Spikevine clubs''''' were [[enchanted]] [[club]]s wielded by [[druid]]s. They could be found in [[Waterdeep]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "True to the name, a ''spikevine club'' was a gnarled piece of wood covered in spikes and entwined by a thorny vine.",
        "Powers": "Any who were struck by the club risked serious injury, but so too did their nearby allies. At unpredictable intervals, a ''spikevine club'' might lash out at nearby foes upon tasting the blood of an enemy.",
        "Notable Owners": "* [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]], a [[dwarf]] druid."
