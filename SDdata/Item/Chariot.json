Some scholars believe that many of these stories were accounts of [[spelljammer]] sightings.\n\nPrior to the development of chariots by mortals, the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi gods]] [[Horus-Re|Horus]], [[Osiris]], and [[Re]] all owned [[magical item|magical]] chariots. Though only Re's would survive the [[Orcgate Wars]].\n\nIn the land of [[Zakhara]], chariots dated back to the earliest days of civilization.\n\nThe development of the chariot proved to be crucial in the [[Calimshan]] Empire's battles against the [[beholder]]s of the [[Alimir Mountains]] between [[-1280 DR|-1280]] to [[-1080 DR|−1080 DR]]. \n\nSome time between the First and Second [[Mulhorand]]i Empires, around [[-1048 DR|-1048]] to [[-105 DR]], people in the land of Mulhorand discovered the wheel and soon after developed chariots.\n\nIn [[729 DR]], when the [[Scaled Horde]] overran the nation of [[Impiltur]], a [[nalfeshnee]] named [[Drallith|Drallith \"the Poxed\"]] drove a [[gold]]en chariot pulled by chained [[chasme]].<ref>\n\nFollowing the introduction of the [[saddle]] and [[stirrup]] to Zakhara, the widespread use of chariots there gradually died out.\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], the army of [[Bloodstone]] fielded chariots against their enemies in the [[Bloodstone Wars]].<ref>",
