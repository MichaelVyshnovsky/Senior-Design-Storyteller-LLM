        "mainbody": "A '''''ring of arachnid control''''' was a [[magic]]al ring that allowed the wearer to control [[spider]]s.",
        "Powers": "As mentioned above, a ''ring of arachnid control'' gave the wearer the ability to control the actions of spiders as if they were under the effect of a ''[[ring of mammal control]]''. The term \"spiders\" in this case applied to creatures who were magically changed into spider shape too.\n\nThe number of spiders that could be brought under control depended on the spiders' size. If the subjected spider was a [[giant spider]], only one could be controlled. If the spiders were of a normal size, a number between ten to forty could be controlled.\n\nThe ring could securely control spiders that were non-intelligent. When the spiders in question were intelligent, like creatures who were ''[[polymorph]]ed'' into spiders, they could resist the control.\n\nA few requirements needed to be met on the wearer's side to maintain control over the spiders. First, the wearer needed visual contact with the spiders to be controlled. Second, the wearer needed to mentally concentrate on controlling the spiders. This concentration forced him or her to refrain from any actions that could break it, like spellcasting or engaging in combat. Even movement was slowed while maintaining visual contact with the spiders under control.\n\nIf the concentration was broken, the spiders were freed from any control and did whatever they wanted, including just running away.\n\nA ''ring of arachnid control'' was a ring with charges. It was created with ten to a hundred charges and every activation drained one charge. The ring could be activated once per hour for up to ten minutes. When the ring's operation was halted, for example by breaking concentration, a one-hour gap between uses was required.",
        "History": "''Rings of arachnid control'' were [[magic item]]s associated with the [[drow]]."
