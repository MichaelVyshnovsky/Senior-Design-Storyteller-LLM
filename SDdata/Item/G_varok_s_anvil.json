        "mainbody": "varoks anvil was once a profitable and secretly enchanted anvil that belonged to a renowned dwarvish smith named Gvarok of Mirabar some years before the late 14 century DR.\nAs the , Gvaroks anvil was a large anvil, cracked in two, with its surface looking blackened and brittle.\nWhen it was used by Gvarok, the anvil was enchanted to dramatically improve the dwarfs blacksmithing work.\nGvarok of Mirabar became renowned for his great work forging weapons and armor of the highest quality, years before 1374 DR. Unbeknownst to everyone but the dwarf, he commissioned the enchanting of his anvil by a master wizard, ensuring that every piece crated on it was a marvelous masterpiece. With time, Gvarok fame spread across the Sword Coast and the dwarf pridefully declared himself the greatest smith alive. The fame eventually was Gvaroks downfall. A powerful frost giant and a master smith named Marruti from all the way in the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale headed off the dwarfs claims. The giant traveled to Mirabar and challenged Gvarok to a smithing contest. Historical accounts did not preserve the competitions details but its outcome was well known. Marruti was the first to take a hammer to Gvaroks anvil and with a single strike cracked it in the middle. With the anvil becoming unusable, Gvarok lost the competition, unable to magically boost his smithing skills. The dwarf left Mirabar in disgrace and Gvaroks anvil, reportedly, was taken by Marruti as a trophy.\nBy 1374 DR, Gvaroks anvil had found its way into the hands of planeswalking wizard and curio dealer Mintassan the Magnificent and was proudly displayed among many other unique and strange items in his shop, Mintassans Mysteries."
