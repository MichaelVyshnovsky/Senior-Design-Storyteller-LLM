Tigermist was a landscape painting created in or before the late 15 century DR.
This serene landscape depicted a mist filling a valley in between improbable peaks. This fog was known as "tigermist" in Faer√ªnian folklore for its uncanny padding quality.
In the , copies of the Tigermist painting were found in certain homes and establishments of the city of Baldurs Gate, the Western Heartlands, and within the ruined apothecary shop in the blighted village of Moonhaven.
