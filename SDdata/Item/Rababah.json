        "mainbody": "rababah () was a strange stringed Zakharan instrument.\nThe rababah was a single-stringed instrument that consisted of a rectangular soundbox from which rose a thin neck. The base of the rababah was covered with horse or goat hide. The string was attached to a movable post located at the top of the neck. A horsehair bow was used on the string while moving the post up or down, creating a beautiful melodic tone.\nThe rababah was the traditional instrument of choice among the nomadic Al-Badia tribes of Zakhara."
