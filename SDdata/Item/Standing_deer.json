        "mainbody": "The '''''standing deer''''' was a magical chalice. It was one of the ''[[Wo-ha Ui-jung]]'', a collection of magical vessels created by the [[Han people]] of [[Koryo]] in ancient times.<ref group=\"note\">The ''standing deer'' is also called \"''standing monkey''\", but since there is already a ''[[sitting monkey]]'', and the chalices are all of different animals, this is presumed to be an error and that this is a deer after all. ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume IV]]'', however, reprints this and calls it \"''standing monkey''\" twice.",
        "Description": "It was carved in the shape of a deer and had a deep cup.",
        "Powers": "The magic of the ''standing deer'' was invoked by filling it with [[rose]] petals. It could be used to cure blindness and to cast the [[shukenja]] [[spell]] ''[[commune with lesser spirit]]''. Handling the chalice caused its glamor to rub off on the holder, improving their social status as with the spell ''[[face]]''.",
        "History": "As one of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung'', the ''standing deer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost.\n\nIn the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], King [[Wanang Sun]] led an expedition to recover three of the ''Wo-ha Ui-jung''. He was successful, discovering the ''[[sitting bull]]'', ''[[sitting monkey]]'', and ''standing deer'' by [[1357 DR]]."
