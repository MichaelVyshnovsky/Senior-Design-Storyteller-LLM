        "History": "The first pair of the ''gloves of concentration'' was created by a [[wizard]] [[Beregost Hamish]] who noticed his ability to concentrate on complex spells was diminishing with age. He created these gloves as a tool to help relax his mind, allowing him to be able to easily cast spells even in dangerous situations. Eventually, he died of old age, but not before making a fortune by selling the gloves to his fellow spellcasters.",
