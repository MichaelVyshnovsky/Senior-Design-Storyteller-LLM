        "mainbody": "Fishing tackle kits were boxed sets of gear necessary for fishing.\nThese kits typically included a wooden rod, a silken line, and steel hooks that would all be assembled to form a fishing rod. These kits also typically included narrow netting, velvet lures, a variety of fishing tackles, such as bobbers made from corkwood and leadsinkers.\nThe price of fishing tackles varied depending upon the demand and availability.\nGeneral goods stores that stocked adventuring gear typically had these kits for sale. One known supplier of these kits was Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, whose kits included rods made of birchwood.\n* Rangers frequently owned fishing tackles.\n* Fishing tackles were commonly used by the members of Clan Battlehammer that lived in Icewind Dale.\n* Jelde Asturien almost never left his home town of Eveningstar without his fishing tackle."
