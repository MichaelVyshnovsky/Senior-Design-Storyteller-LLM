        "mainbody": "An '''yklwa''' ({{Pronounce|YICK|ul|wah|refs=}}) was a [[Chult]]an short spear.",
        "Description": "A typical yklwa was four feet long, with about 40% of the length taken up by its sword-like, bladed point. It was primarily used as a thrusting spear in melee combat and was not well-balanced for throwing. It dealt more damage than a normal short spear but could only be thrown accurately with half a short spear's range. Yklwas could be wielded with two hands, but [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] warriors typically used them in conjunction with oval hide shields called ''[[hlang]]''.\n\nThe name \"yklwa\" supposedly mimicked the sucking sound heard when pulling the weapon from the heart of a slain dinosaur.",
        "History": "In the late 15th century DR, the sale of yklwas in [[Port Nyanzaru]] was controlled by the merchant prince [[Ekene-Afa]]."
