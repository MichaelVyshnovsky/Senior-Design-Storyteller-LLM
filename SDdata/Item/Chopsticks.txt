'''Chopsticks''' were paired eating utensils found primarily in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Plain [[bamboo]] chopsticks were cheap and common, while people of means used [[lacquer]]ed chopsticks.

==Usage==
Chopsticks were part of the regular kit of any sensible traveler from Kara-Tur.

Broken and whole chopsticks could be used for the "stick magic" of [[Trigrams]] [[divination]]s.

A pair of tightly-clutched chopsticks could be used as an emergency backup weapon if nothing else was available, though they were of inferior reach and lethality to any other weapon, and utterly terrible at dealing with [[armor]].
