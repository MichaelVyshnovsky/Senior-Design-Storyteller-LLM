        "mainbody": "oon Mountain Ale was the primary product of the Moon Mountain Brewery, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nFully two-thirds of the quantity of beverages that came from the Moon Mountain Brewery, this ale was clear and light, made from barley, hops, and the waters of the Unicorn Run,\nThis drink was popular in Daggerford, Llorkh, Loudwater, and Secomber, where it was sold by the keg. Outside of this corridor along the Delimbiyr, it was mostly sold in topkegs for making ale flips.\nThe recipe and method for brewing this beverage belonged to Mrune Moontan, a half-elf sorceress that married Oblar Minstrelwish, a halfling adventurer. The \"Moon Mountain\" moniker was from the mispronunciation of her name."
