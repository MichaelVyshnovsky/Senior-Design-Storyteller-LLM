        "mainbody": "Kozahs Needle was a magic staff named after an ancient god of lightning.\nKozahs Needle was  long. It could be folded into a  walking stick, but also transformed into a triple bar with a  center bar, joined to a  bar on each end joined to the center with chains (like a dire threshing flail), or split in half to form a pair of flails of two  bars joined with chains.\nKozahs Needle built up an electric charge as it was used, and it could unleash electricity, even channeling it through an opponents metal weapon. In addition, if charged enough, it could emit a large blast of lightning that could burn a hole into an opponent and lay them low. It was also discovered by accident that it could absorb electric magic to charge it.\n* Dahlia Sinfelle used Kozahs Needle as her primary weapon and was considered by Sylora Salm to be one of its most proficient wielders."
