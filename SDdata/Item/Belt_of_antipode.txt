A belt of antipode was a magical item of clothing that conferred a resistance to cold to its wearer, at the cost of a weakness to fire.
This belt was trimmed with polar bear fur, and it was adorned with images of blue moons and white ice floes.
Towards the end of his life at the hands of Sarevok Anchev, Gorion wore a belt of antipode.
