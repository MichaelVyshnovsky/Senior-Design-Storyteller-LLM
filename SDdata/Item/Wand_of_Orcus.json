        "Description": "The wand was a black obsidian and iron rod topped with the skull of a human hero once slain by Orcus. It was considered a [[Major Artifact]].",
        "Powers": "If wielded in melee the wand functioned as a ''+6 [[unholy]] [[chaotic]] [[heavy mace]]''. If a non-outsider, or an [[outsider]] (except very powerful ones) touched the wand, there was a chance he or she would die immediately.\n\nThe wielder of the Wand of Orcus could call upon each of the following powers once per day:\n* ''[[Abyssal might]]''\n* ''[[Bodak birth]]''\n* ''[[Call nightmare]]''\n* ''[[Clutch of Orcus]]''\n* ''[[Summon monster VII]]''\n* ''[[Wrack]]''\n* ''[[Wretched blight]]''<ref name=BoVD-1>",
        "Destruction": "[[File:Wand of Orcus AFC.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ''Wand of Orcus'' wielded by the Lord of the Undead.]]\nThe Wand of Orcus was once destroyed by [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and party after they traveled to the [[Abyss]] and stole it from Orcus using advice from [[Saint Sollars]]. [[Bahamut]] directed them to the only method of its destruction, which was to immerse the wand in the black blood of [[Tiamat]]'s heart.\n\nThe adventurers used the heart of Tiamat's avatar, which proved just as effective, but Bahamut admitted that the Wand of Orcus would eventually return to existence<ref name=TToB-1> in one century.<ref name=TToB-2>\n\nAfter being destroyed in Tiamat's blood, the heart of the wand was left behind in the form of a small white gem. This gem was planted in the courtyard of [[Palace Dragonsbane]] in [[Bloodstone Village]] and grew into a tall white tree with golden leaves. The [[Tree-Gem of Bloodstone]] prevented [[demon]]s from entering Bloodstone."
