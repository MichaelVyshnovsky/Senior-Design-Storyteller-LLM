It possessed a +4 enchantment and it was even more powerful, reaching +6, when used against creatures that were sensitive to light, such as drow and the undead.\nThe wielder of this pike also gained enhanced reflexes and will, but reduced defense against spells and abilities that affected the targets fortitude.\nIn 1369 DR, Dawnpike was already an ancient weapon, buried deep inside the Elven Catacombs of Myth Drannor.
