'''Ssarramath''' were prayer foci of [[Sseth]], the World Serpent, that adorned the homes of [[yuan-ti]] followers.

==Description==
Ssarramath came in a variety of shapes and sizes. They could be as simple as a [[snake]]-headed coil scratched onto a wall or as elaborate as life-sized carvings of a serpent. These statues were coiled in a similar intertwined manner to a [[caduceus]]. Each yuan-ti home held at least one ssarramath. Ssarramath statues were placed in carved bowls filled with lit scented [[oil]]s and bodies of creatures sacrificed to venerate Sseth, the World Serpent.
