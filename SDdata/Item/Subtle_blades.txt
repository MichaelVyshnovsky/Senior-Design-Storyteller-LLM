Subtle blades were enchanted daggers used by rogues and assassins. They could be found in Waterdeep as of the late 15 century DR.
Especially when dual-wielded, subtle blades could be used to make attacks that appeared to be at once both feints and strikes. Their enchantment meant that they were particularly effective for disarming an opponent.
