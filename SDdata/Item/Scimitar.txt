The scimitar () was a one-handed, martial melee weapon of the sword family.
The scimitar was similar to the falchion in that it was a "backsword", sharpened on one edge and the other edge was thicker to give it strength. Scimitar blades were  long and almost always curved, though a few were angled like a khopesh. Starting at the hilt, the blade might taper gradually to a point or might increase in width and then rapidly come to a point. The hilt was one-handed and had quillons.

Scimitars did not have the damaging power of longswords or other heavier swords, but with skill they could hit vital areas better than most. Using the one-sided, curved scimitar required special training and was therefore classified as a martial weapon.
Scimitars first became available in the Netheril Empire in . They had developed from the khopesh, which were created a thousand years prior. During this time scimitars were primarily utilized by drow.
In later centuries, these blades were commonly favored by Calishites and some druids.
