The '''scimitar''' ({{Pronounce|SIM|i|tar|refs = {{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was a one-handed, martial melee weapon of the [[sword]] family.

==Description==
The scimitar was similar to the [[falchion]] in that it was a "backsword", sharpened on one edge and the other edge was thicker to give it strength. Scimitar blades were {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} long and almost always curved, though a few were angled like a [[khopesh]]. Starting at the hilt, the blade might taper gradually to a point or might increase in width and then rapidly come to a point. The hilt was one-handed and had [[wikipedia:quillon|quillons]].

==Weaponology==
[[File:Drizzt and guenhwyvar-5e.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Drizzt Do'Urden]] wielding his legendary pair of scimitars, Icingdeath and Twinkle.'']]
Scimitars did not have the damaging power of [[longsword]]s or other heavier swords, but with skill they could hit vital areas better than most. Using the one-sided, curved scimitar required special training and was therefore classified as a martial weapon.

==History==
Scimitars first became available in the [[Netheril|Netheril Empire]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1800|NY}}. They had developed from the khopesh, which were created a thousand years prior. During this time scimitars were primarily utilized by [[drow]].

In later centuries, these blades were commonly favored by [[Calimshan|Calishites]] and some [[druid]]s.
