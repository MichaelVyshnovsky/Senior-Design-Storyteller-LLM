==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], these helmets were in high demand among folk who made living by guarding people, possessions, and places. However, ''Watchman's helms'' were just as popular among thieves and rogues for the same reasons.

In [[1374 DR]], a ''Watchman's helm'' was offered to brave adventurers who were strong enough to exterminate [[undead]] creatures out of the [[Mere of Dead Men]].
