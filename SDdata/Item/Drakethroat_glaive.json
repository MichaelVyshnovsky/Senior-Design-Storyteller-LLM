        "Powers": "''Drakethroat glaive'' possessed a formidable ''+2'' enchantment that guided the blade towards the target and made its slashes more devastating than a mundane glaive. Those who wilded the weapon were granted the ability to unleash ''vicious [[dragon breath]]'', a more powerful variant of a [[dragonborn]]'s breath weapon. Additionally, the wielder could cast ''[[draconic elemental weapon]]'' spell once per day, imbuing the glaive with magical energies of a chosen element.",
        "History": "Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the draconic deity Kereska aided a dragonborn who faced a group of [[carbuncular spider]]s by gifting a ''drakethroat glaive'' to them. The dragonborn successfully survived the battle. Some time later, by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, ''drakethroat glaive'' ended up in the hands of a [[Zhentish]] agent and merchant, [[Roah Moonglow]], who worked with the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. The enchanted glaive could be found with Roah during her stay at the [[Moonrise Towers]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]."
