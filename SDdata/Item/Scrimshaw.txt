Scrimshaw was a craft consisting of artful designs carved in or on bone or ivory. Those who practice it were known as scrimshanders.
Scrimshaw carved from the head bones of the knucklehead trout were a primary product of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale in northwest Faer√ªn. Caravans regularly traveled up from the south through the Sea of Moving Ice to Icewind Dale to buy up scrimshaw carvings, bringing coin to the region.
The people of Ice Peak Island also produced scrimshaw, which they sold at the Aurilssbarg trading post.
In Icewind Dale, skilled scrimshanders who worked with knucklehead bone were well-respected and influential. Fishermen bringing back a good catch of knucklehead for food and scrimshaw was a highlight of daily life in the dale.
Discovery of knucklehead bone and the art of scrimshaw led to the foundation of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, as it brought traders to the region.
