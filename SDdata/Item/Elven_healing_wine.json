        "mainbody": "'''Elven healing wine''' was a unique type of [[elven]] [[wine]], found only in the ruins of [[Severed Hand]].",
        "Powers": "This wine possessed the properties of a [[healing potion]].",
        "History": "Some time prior to the fortress's destruction, the [[Seldarine]] [[priest]]s of the [[Severed Hand|Hand of Seldarine]] became heavily intoxicated during an elven festival one day. In their drunk stupor, the priests accidentally added a barrel of some type of elven wine to a mixture that had been intended for healing potions. Following this incident, bottles of the new concoction were sold by the elven merchant [[Lehland]].\n\nFollowing his transformation into a [[ghost]], Lehland continued to offer elven healing wine alongside other products."
