        "mainbody": "ottled lightning was a weapon attachment, a cartridge that held one powerful charge of mundane or magic lightning.\nBottled lightning was a small cartridge that fitted inside specially designed hilts of weapons. These weapons were naturally strangely heavy in the hilt. One such weapon was a rapier Lorenzo Utrelli wielded in combat.\nBottled lightning was activated via a trigger on the weapons hilt. Once on, a bottle released its deadly charge, shocking the target and throwing it like a sack puppet away from the bottled lightning weapon. The electric charge could travel through blades crossed in a duel or blades close enough to each other. The charges power was similar to a blue dragons lightning breath. When a bottled lightning weapon was submerged in water, it became a more powerful weapon that shocked, sizzled, and singed all creatures and objects that touched the liquid.\nHowever powerful the invention was, its creation was technically cheap but extremely dangerous, especially considering that each bottled lightning was a single-use item. According to Utrelli, anyone could easily recharge exhausted bottled lightning containers by draining the magical lightning charge from sleeping blue dragons, or by flying metallic kites during thunderstorms.\nLorenzo Utrelli from the city-state of Lomatra was the inventor of bottled lightning, and he held the patent with the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms for the ingenious item. The young House Utrelli noble was planning on replacing enchanted weapons with the bottled lightning arms.\nDuring the Festival of Blades of the , Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomatra used his bottled lightning rapier in a duel with shocking efficiency. His opponent, a minor rowdy noble who offended Princess Milianna Mannicci da Sumbria was thrown back like a marionette that had its strings tugged with force. The electrifying duel energized and impressed all the drunken revelers.\nIn the fall of the same year, Lorenzo Utrelli used his bottled lightning against a charging gaggle of enraged blood-thirsty tutors of the Velvet Gauntlet Finishing School for Wayward Young Ladies during the mission to rescue Milianna Mannicci, who was sent to the hellish establishment for not conducting herself accordingly to standards of nobility. The young inventor submerged his rapier into a puddle of water and unleashed the power of science, instantly dispatching all of his opponents."
