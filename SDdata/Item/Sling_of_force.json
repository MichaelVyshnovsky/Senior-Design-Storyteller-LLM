        "Powers": "''Slings of force'' possessed a potent ''+3'' enchantment and magically boosted the wielder's physical strength and allowed the wilder to use their strength to increase the damage output of each [[bullet]] sent towards the targets.",
        "History": "''Slings of force'' were crafted by a diminutive tinkered and an aspiring adventurer named Gendlesen Barstow sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. Gendlesen thought that in order to adventure, she needed to be stronger. To achieve that, she started making these weapons in many variations and designs. Most of the ''slings of force'' ended up stoled off of Gendlesen's workbench and ended up in the hands of many people across [[Faer√ªn]]. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of these slings found their way to the city of [[Neverwinter]] as well as the merchants of the [[Crossroad Keep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}."
