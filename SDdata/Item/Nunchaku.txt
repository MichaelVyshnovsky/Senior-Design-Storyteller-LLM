Nunchaku () were a type of exotic melee weapon typically used by monks.
The nunchaku was made of two hardwood wands or dowels,  long and  in diameter, connected at one end by a stout leather cord or a metal chain.
It took special training, such as monks received, to use this exotic weapon effectively in melee combat.
Nunchaku could be used to disarm an opponent much like the flail. Monks could take full advantage of this quick, bludgeoning weapon.
* Nunchaku were a favored weapon of the clerics of Waukeen. The goddess herself wielded a nunchaku in the form of a cloud of coins.
* Nunchaku were one of the few weapons the monks of the Disciples of the White Rod order were known to fight with. The ones they fought with had leather wrappings on their hilts that were bleached white.
