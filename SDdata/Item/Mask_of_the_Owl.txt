The Mask of the Owl was an enchanted mask created by the rashemi wizard Shevarith Kendia in the late 15 century DR.
The Mask was in the style of those worn by the Witches of Rashemen, and was intended to invoke the predatory presence of an owl. It was complemented by the rest of her custom clothing, including her enchanted boots, called the Claws of the Owl.
Shevarith imbued the Mask of the Owl with the power to paralyze her foes with fear, allowing her to cast power word, stun.
The design and powers of the Mask of the Owl were inspired by a memorable event from Shevariths childhood in which she witnessed a snowy owl cause its prey to freeze in terror with a screech.
