The '''''Vision of the Absolute''''' was an enchanted [[pole arm]] that belonged to one of the [[True Soul]]s of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Vision of the Absolute'' was a [[spear]] with a head covered in dangerous and intimidating barbs.

==Powers==
The spearhead's construction and its enchantment caused the weapon to strike at the target's eyes with no error. The more eyes the creature had, the more effective the weapon was. It also had a chance of causing ''[[blind]]ness'' upon a successful hit.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the ''Vision of the Absolute'' was used for hunting an [[owlbear]] near the [[Shattered Sanctum]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. In the hunt, the spear was snapped in two, with its head lodged in the owlbear's flesh and haft left with the dying rent True Soul of the [[Absolute]]. Even though the ''Vision'' was snapped in two, it was easily reparable if two pieces were reunited.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Edowin]], a [[dwarven]] [[True Soul]] of the cult.
