The well of many worlds was a legendary, wondrous item that had an effect similar to the spell gate.
The well of many worlds was similar in appearance to a portable hole. It was a fine black cloth, with a softness similar to silk, typically folded up like a handkerchief. When unfolded it had a circular shape,  in diameter.
By unfolding this object upon a solid surface, one could open a two-way portal to another planet or plane of existence. The planet or plane that a well of many worlds opened to was different each time it was used. Its portal could be closed by taking hold of the cloths edges and folding it up. After use, one had to wait one to eight hours before they could open another portal.
Notably, this object would not function when within the Demiplane of Dread, though while there it continued to radiate strong detectable magic.
Some time in the midâ€“14 century DR, a Mulmaster wizard possessing one of these was on the ship Moonwind when it was sunk by a storm  off the coast of its destination, Ravens Bluff. During the confusion, this well of many worlds fell out of the wizards robe and unfolded upon the ship, opening a portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire that water proceeded to flood into. In the days that followed, the water level of Dragon Reach and the Sea of Fallen Stars dropped by an inch each day as the ocean continued to flood into the well of many worlds. Much of it poured into the City of Brass. After four days, Rolf Sunriver assembled a group of adventurers to investigate this and had them equipped with supplies by Calvin Longbottle.
