        "mainbody": "eepknights brigandine was a type of enchanted heavy armor found in Gauntlgrym and in areas of the Underdark.\nDeepknights brigandine possessed increased defensive qualities, enchanted specifically for those who ventured into the deadly darkness of the Underdark. These types of armor were dyed to blend in with the pitch blackness of the underground caves. Despite being a heavy type of armor, it was crafted light enough to help the wearer dodge attacks of the Underdarks hungry denizens.\nThese brigandines were worn by dwarven forces and adventurers who came to Bruenor Battlehammers aid in Gauntlgrym in the 15 century DR. The underground city was besieged by Orcuss demons and alhoons attempting to claim Gauntlgrym. Bruenor himself was unable to defend his throne as he was sworn to aid Drizzt DoUrden against Demogorgon, ravaging the Underdark."
