Orc rolling pin was an enchanted rolling pin that could also be used as a menacing bludgeon.
This rolling pin, also functioning as a club, possessed a +1 enchantment and upon a successful slice could stun its target for 24 seconds.
One of these orcish cooking tools was wielded by a raging orc matron of the Bonegnasher tribe, outside of the Old Owl Well in 1374 DR.
