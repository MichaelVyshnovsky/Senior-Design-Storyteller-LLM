When a charge was expelled, the wearer was surrounded by a sphere of protective energy that turned away physical projectiles and slowed attacks made with melee weapons.\n* Durlag Trollkiller, the famous dwarven adventurer kept one of these cloaks within his tower.\n* Firkraag, the red dragon who made his lair in Amn."
