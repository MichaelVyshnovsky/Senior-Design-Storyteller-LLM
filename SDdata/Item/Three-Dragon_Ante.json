        "mainbody": "'''Three-Dragon Ante''' was a card game played in many taverns across [[Faer√ªn]], including [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Played across all levels of society, the game was sometimes called '''copper dragons''' or '''three-copper''' when played by peasants, as well as '''golds''' or '''plats''' when played by adventurers and aristocrats.",
        "Description": "The dedicated deck of Three-Dragon Ante consisted of one hundred cards. Of those, seventy were standard [[dragon]] cards, divided in ten suits of seven cards, each representing one type of [[chromatic dragon|chromatic]] or [[Metallic dragon|metallic]] dragonThe Metallic Dragon suits are Copper, Brass, Bronze, Silver & Gold and the Chromatic Dragon suits are Black, Red, Green, Blue, & White.. The remaining thirty cards depicted other types of creatures, which included stronger Legendary dragon cardsThere were originally only 3 Legendary Dragon cards: Bahamut [Good / Colorless], Tiamat [Evil / Colorless], and Dracolich [Colorless]. This was later expanded to 15, adding Metallic Wyrmling, Copper Trickster, Brass Sultan, Bronze Warlord, Silver Seer, Gold Monarch, Chromatic Wyrmling, Black Raider, Red Destroyer, Green Schemer, Blue Overlord, and White Hunter. When triggered, the Metallic Legendary Dragons grant the drawing of more cards, the Chromatic Legendary Dragons grant gold or forces an opponent to put gold in the pot, and the \"Colorless\" Dragons have special abilities. like the two [[Draconic pantheon|draconic deities]] [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]], and non-draconic creatures, collectively called \"mortals\"Each Mortal card has unique special game effects when triggered. Originally there were 7 Mortal cards: Archmage, Dragonslayer, Druid, Fool, Illusionist, Priest, and Thief. This was later expanded to 15, adding the Dragonrider, Kobold, Merchant, Princess, Prophet, Queen, Sorcerer, & Wyrmpriest. in the game. The many existing variants of the game mainly differed in the choice of those additional cards. \n\nAt the beginning of play the dealer must separate the 70 suit cards from the 15 Legendary Dragon and 15 Mortal cards. The 30 special cards are then shuffled and 10 cards are drawnPlayers using the \"Classic\" rules use the original 10 special cards: the Dragons Bahamut, Tiamat, and Dracolich and the Mortals Archmage, Dragonslayer, Druid, Fool, Illusionist, Priest, and Thief.. Then the 70 suit cards and the 10 special cards are shuffled together. Each player draws a hand of 6 cards (during play they can hold a maximum of 10 cards).    \n\nThe game consisted of rounds called \"gambits\" that involved betting and building sets of cards that competed with one another. The first phase of the gambit was a round of betting, or \"ante\", when players placed bets determined by random card draws on the stakes at the center of the table. It then proceeded to the second phase, when players took turns in placing cards in front of them to form \"flights\". At the end of three rounds, the player with the strongest flight collected the stakes. In addition, certain cards granted special moves whose effects could shape a single play or the dynamics of the entire gambit.\n\n\"Flights\" are a set of three cards. \"Color Flights\" are grouped by the same dragon color suit (like three Gold Dragon cards). \"Strength Flights\" are grouped by the same card value (like three Dragon cards of different color suits worth \"5\"). A \"Fellowship\" is a group of three Mortal cards.",
        "In Game Rules": "If the players are playing Three Dragon Ante during a gaming session, then they must make a d20 roll to see how well they perform. Characters who are Proficient in Three Card Ante get to add their Proficiency bonus to the roll. If they want to cheat, they must make a Sleight of Hand skill roll. If they want to bluff or blather their opponents into betting their way, they need to make a Persuasion skill roll.",

        "Reputation": "The game was popular across all social classes. The main difference was the type of [[currency]] employed in the ante. Peasants and farmers usually played for [[copper piece]]s, while merchants and artisans favored betting [[silver]], and adventurers typically played with [[gold]] or even [[platinum]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1494}},{{BG-DiA-time}} the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in Baldur's Gate kept a chest filled with popular games such as [[Dragonchess]] and Three-Dragon Ante, for the use of its patrons.\n\nThe game was also popular among the Zhentarim, who often played it during their free time."
