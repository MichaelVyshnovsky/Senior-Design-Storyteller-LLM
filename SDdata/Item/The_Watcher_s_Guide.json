        "mainbody": "The Watchers Guide was an ancient enchanted spear from the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn.\nThe weapon was dulled and weathered by time and the metal had lost its sheen. Despite that, The Watchers Guide glowed gently with blue magical radiance. Those who held the spear could feel its old grim yet divine magic.\nThe magical spear possessed the Deaths Promise enchantment that, upon each missed strike, activated the true strike spell that increased the wielders chance of striking the same target.\nIn the 15 century DR, it was stored in a sarcophagus in an ancient ruined temple dedicated to Jergal, within a heavily trapped crypt. The spears owner was gifted The Watchers Guide for his unyielding service and loyalty, both, in life and after death."
