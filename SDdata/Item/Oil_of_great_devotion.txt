'''''Oil of great devotion''''' was a magical substance that could be found in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|46}}{{Cite dragon/179/Wonders of the Land of Fate}}

==Description==
The vast majority of magical potions and oils in Zakhara were found in durable flasks sealed with crystal and wax. These flasks were wider and the bottom than they were at the top.

==Powers==
If a priest of low to middle ranking used this oil, it temporarily granted them a higher understanding of their clerical power. This did not grant additional spells, but it did increase the effectiveness of other abilities such as turning or commanding [[undead]].

''Oil of great devotion'' was only usable by priests.
