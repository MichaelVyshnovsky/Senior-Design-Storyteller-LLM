        "Powers": "The iron circlet aided in protecting its wearer from physical attacks. However, if a single word of pride was said while wearing the circlet, it instantly became a cursed item, making it easier for the wearer to be struck by physical attacks.\n\nThe cursed version of the iron circlet could only be removed with a ''[[remove curse]]'' spell or a ''[[wish]]''."
