Their business never suffered any ill fortune, their crops were bountiful, and their livestock exclusively gave birth to twins. In addition, they gained the ability to cast certain spells: ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', and&mdash;occasionally&mdash;''[[weather control]]''.\n\nThe power of the ''Coin'' was intended to be shared&mdash;greedy usage resulted in a [[curse]] being placed on its owner. This curse increased its victims hunger proportionally to their greed: a person who had abused the ''Coin of Jisan'' to amass great personal wealth and power would find themselves having to devour extreme quantities of food, [[tea]], and [[kaeth|coffee]]. The only way to be rid of the curse was to give the ''Coin'' to a stranger.",

Wiser caliphs chose to ally with bearers of the ''Coin'' instead, by marrying their daughters away.\n\nThe ''Coin of Jisan'' was especially coveted by the [[dao]] of Zakhara, who were eager to steal its power for themselves. It was also an object of interest to the [[holy slayer]]s of the [[Gilded Palm]].\n\nDespite the interest of these powerful entities, the ''Coin'' was carried by worshipers of Jisan for most of its history, although it was never known to have had the same owner for more than seven years at a time.",
        "Reputation": "The ''Coin of Jisan'' was said to be given to its owners by Jisan, or by [[Zakharan pantheon#Fate|Fate]] itself. It was well known for bestowing prosperity, wisdom, and fertility on its bearers."
