Tallars harp was a magical harp used by the Harpers.
Tallars harp possessed two magical abilities, which were communicated telepathically to anyone who played it. When a specific chord was struck, the harp emitted a stunning effect similar to symbol, but limited to beings within a  radius of the harp, except for the harpist, who was immune to its effects.
Additionally, the harp could temporarily enchant bladed weapons. When the harp was touched to a weapon while a particular melody was played, the blade was granted an enchantment that increased damage. If the weapon already had an enchantment, the harps temporary effect was added to it. Once a weapon was enchanted, it remained as such until it expired or until a dispel magic was applied to the blade. The harpist had no means of ending the enchantment early.
