'''''Tallar's harp''''' was a magical [[harp]] used by the [[Harpers]].

==Powers==
''Tallar's harp'' possessed two magical abilities, which were communicated telepathically to anyone who played it. When a specific chord was struck, the harp emitted a stunning effect similar to ''[[symbol]]'', but limited to beings within a {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} radius of the harp, except for the harpist, who was immune to its effects.

Additionally, the harp could temporarily enchant bladed weapons. When the harp was touched to a weapon while a particular melody was played, the blade was granted an enchantment that increased damage. If the weapon already had an enchantment, the harp's temporary effect was added to it. Once a weapon was enchanted, it remained as such until it expired or until a ''[[dispel magic]]'' was applied to the blade. The harpist had no means of ending the enchantment early.
