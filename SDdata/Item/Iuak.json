        "mainbody": "An iuak was a blade made of bone or stone that resembled a machete, common in the Great Glacier.\nAn iuak was about  long and  wide. It had a flat tip, and weighed about . In some lands, it could sell for as much as twelve gold pieces.\nIt was primarily used for carving snow blocks for snow houses, but it could also be used as a weapon. However, Iuaks tended to break if employed in combat by someone not skilled in their usage.\nthumb|center\nNearly every Iulutiun hunter carried an iuak. The weapon was rare among the Nakulutiuns.\nThe great explorer Sharra Frohm carried an iuak as did the famous Iulutiun philosopher Inum. Najass, a master Iulutiun hunter, fought with a custom-made, two-handed iuak made from tirichik bone."
