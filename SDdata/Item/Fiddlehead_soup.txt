'''Fiddlehead soup''' was a [[soup]] dish made in [[Faer√ªn]], using the fiddlehead of a [[fern]].

==Description==
A recipe for fiddlehead soup used in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] was prepared with young fiddleheads, a knob of [[butter]], a single [[onion]], one [[garlic]] clove, some [[flour]], various root vegetables, heavy [[whipping cream]], [[chicken stock]], and some [[salt]] & [[pepper]].

==Locations==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the [[village]] of [[Dead Tree Hollow]] in [[the Vast]] was famous for its fiddlehead soup when the fiddleheads were in season. It also made a [[fern-frond soup]] from older plants.

A fern-and-fiddlehead soup was made at the [[Stag Steads]] royal hunting lodge in [[Cormyr]] around [[1367 DR]].

When in season, fiddlehead soup and fried [[mushroom]]s were standard fare at the [[Moonwyvern Inn]] near [[Silverymoon]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/288/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Moonwyvern Inn|75}}
