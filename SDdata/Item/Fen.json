        "mainbody": "he fen was the lowest unit of currency used in Kara-Tur.\nThe fen took the form of a copper coin with a hole through the center, similar to the yuan. Five fen were worth 1 yuan, 100 fen were worth 1 chao or 1 tael, and 1000 fen were worth 1 chien.\nThanks to their holes, collections of fens and yuans were threaded on strings in amounts of 50â€“100, which was convenient for counting and carrying them. These cash strings could be worn on the wrist and tucked inside the sleeve.\nCategoryCurrency\nCategoryCopper items\nCategoryMetal items\nCategory0-24 gold pieces\nCategoryItems from Kara-Tur\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\no1mlu11j0tdfhkml70l3rmy3kgn7jhz"
