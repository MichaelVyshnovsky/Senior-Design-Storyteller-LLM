'''''Maces of the moon''''' were [[enchanted]] [[mace]]s wielded by the clergy of [[Selûne]] against the [[Church of Selûne|church's]] [[undead]] enemies.

==Powers==
These bludgeons were ''[[bless]]ed'' by High Priestesses of Selûne under the full moon's glow. The divine moonlight was stored within maces' sharp flanges, creating a powerful ''+3'' enchantment. Every time a ''mace of the moon'' struck an undead creature, it discharged [[radiant]] energy, damaging the targets. Additionally, the wielder of the mace was granted the ability to cast the ''[[lesser restoration]]'' [[spell]] once per day.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, ''maces of the moon'' could be found in [[Thentia]] and [[Elmwood]] temples of Selûne—the [[House of the Moon (Thentia)|House of the Moon]] and  the[[Temple of the Half Moon]].
