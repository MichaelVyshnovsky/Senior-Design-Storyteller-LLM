        "mainbody": "'''Spice''', also known as '''deg''' in [[Dwarvish]],{{Cite dragon/278/A Dwarven Lexicon|45}} was a broad term for a variety of seeds, roots, and bark that were primarily used for seasoning or flavoring food. They were often dried, ground up into a powder, and mixed together with a variety of other spices. Over time the advancement of long distance trade caused spices that were once exclusive to a single region to be spread far and wide across [[Toril]].\n\nTravelers on Toril typically kept spices in little glass [[vial]]s, encased in whittled wooden 'shielding shells' to guard against breakage. These were carried inside of drawstring leather pouches, known as spice pouches. Such pouches had the \"finished\" side as their interior, thus minimizing reactions with the vials' contents.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-13 - Spices When Traveling}}",
        "Varieties": "Spices used throughout Toril included the following:\n* [[Allspice]]\n* [[Almond]]\n* [[Arispeg]]\n* [[Ateris]], a spice that was endemic to the [[Thunder Peaks]] and [[Storm Horns]].\n* [[Awana (spice)|Awana]], a spice that was endemic to the [[Awana|island]] of the same name.\n* [[Bentilan]], a spice that was endemic to the the Thunder Peaks and Storm Horns.\n* [[Canella]]\n* [[Cardamon]]\n* [[Chilis]]\n* [[Cinnamon]]\n* [[Clove]]\n* [[Cocoa]]\n* [[Coffee]]\n* [[Cubeb]]\n* [[Curry]]\n* [[Delph]]\n* [[Fagara]], a spice that was endemic to the country of [[T'u Lung]].\n* [[Fire lichen]], a spice that was endemic to the [[Underdark]].\n* [[Funguswood]], common mushroom used as a wood substitute and sometimes as a savory [[spices|spice]].\n* [[Galingale]]\n* [[Garlic]]\n* [[Ginger]]\n* [[Lingale]], a broth thickener.\n* [[Mace (spice)|Mace]]\n* [[Marka (spice)|Marka]]\n* [[Maxoris]], a spice used as a preservative native to the lower [[Tun River]].\n* [[Mingari]], a spice that was endemic to [[Ulgarth]].\n* [[Myrrh]]\n* [[Nutmeg]]\n* [[Panjar]], a spice that was endemic to [[Tymanther]].\n* [[Paprika]]\n* [[Pepper]]\n* [[Peral]], a choking vine found around the Storm Horns and Thunder Peaks.\n* [[Priadoran fire spice]], a spice that was endemic to the region of [[Priador]].<ref>\n* [[Rosemary]]\n* [[Saffron]]\n* [[Sesame]]\n* [[Tamarind]]\n* [[Tanbark]], a spice that was endemic to [[Anauroch]].<ref>\n* [[Tep yen]], a spice sold in [[Almorel]].{{cite book/Sentinelspire||9}}\n* [[Thyme]]\n* [[Turmeric]]\n* [[Vanilla]], a spice that was endemic to [[Maztica]].\n* [[Yellow safre]], a spice known to the [[yaqubi]] of the [[Khopet-Dag]].\n* [[Zedoary]]",
        "History": "In [[920 DR]], the merchant [[Windyn Balindre]] returned to [[Faerûn]] from [[Kara-tur]] with some of that land's unique spices in tow.\n\nIn [[1238 DR]], a major trade war began between the [[Amn]]ian merchant families [[House Ulvax]] and [[House Ophal|House Ophal.]] This was due to the latter causing House Ulvax's spice trade with [[Zakhara]] to dwindle. The feud between them would persist for over a hundred years, igniting numerous other trade wars. Eventually, it would culminate in the [[Murann Spice War]] in [[1338 DR]]. The [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] would go on to punish House Ulvax for instigating the conflict by revoking their right to engage in the Zakharan spice trade.\n\nAt some point prior to [[1352 DR]], General [[Hie Aie Shek]] cleared out bandits that were scouring the [[Spice Road]].<ref>\n\nFrom [[1356 DR]] <ref> to [[1374 DR]] the [[Highmoon Trading Coster]] was known to trade the spices arispeg, marka, and delph.\n\nAround [[1359 DR]], the following spices were known to be carried by caravans along the Spice Road: Camphor, Caramon, Ginseng, Myrrh, Nutmeg, and Saffron.<ref>\n\nAround [[1367 DR]], a trio of traveling merchants that hailed from Anauroch were trading a variety of spices in [[Shadowdale]] in return for [[silver]]. Some of their spices included curry, pepper, and rock salt.\n\nFor many decades the four rival trading families of [[Marsember]] shipped spices to and from lands all across the [[Inner Sea]]. Over time they became the city's main export and earned it the moniker \"City of Spices.\" In the years leading up to [[1370 DR]] the city's dominance in the spice trade waned as other kingdoms started getting involved in exporting condiments to the [[Sword Coast]], such as [[Westgate]] and [[Nimpeth]].\n\nAround 1370 DR, [[Mithral Hall]]'s alliances with surface kingdoms allowed for the importation of many spices that were once unknown to denizens of the Underdark. Also during this time, spices were one of the few industries of trade that the nation of [[Thay]] had with the lands west of it.\n\nAround [[1372 DR]], rare spices were known to travel across the [[Black Road]]. Around this time an investment of 100 [[gp]] worth of western goods could fetch over 500 gp worth of silk and spices from Kara-Tur.<ref>\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], [[House Se'Sehen]] were known to trade rare spices in return for either slaves or a means by which to transport their spies to northern ports.<ref>\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century, merchants from further south were known to trade spices in the city of [[Bryn Shander]]. Around this same time, merchants were known to travel to [[Port Nyanzaru]] from as far away as the Sword Coast in order to purchase the unique spices of [[Chult]].<ref>",
        "Prices": "In the bazaars of Zakhara the native spices could generally be bought for around 7 [[silver piece]]s to 2 gold pieces per pound.<ref>\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century DR, markets in Waterdeep sold most spices for around 5 [[copper piece]]s to 8 gold pieces per dry {{SI|1|ounce}}, though saffron in particular sold for 40 gold pieces per dry {{SI|1|ounce}}.",
        "Notable Users of Spices": {
            "General": "* Throughout Faerûn meat was typically coated in a mixture of powdered spices, such as sage and rosemary, before being spit-roasted. [[Calishite]]s were particularly known for heavily spicing their meat.<ref>\n* A small number of people carried their own blend of spices when traveling.A modern example given of spice blends was [[Wikipedia:Garam masala|garam masala]].",
            "Groups": "* Spices were among the raw material trade goods that the [[Rundeen]] dealt in.\n* The [[Shad'iar]], the nomadic tribes of the [[Land of the Lions]], often used spices on their simple foods. Whenever a clan, family, or tribe of Shad'iar hosted members of another tribe they would slaughter and cook animals over a great roaring fire. To enhance the flavor of that meat, they would either rubs spices into it or throw them over the bonfire. Spices were also commonly used by them as a barter good.",
            "Races & Intelligent Creatures": "* [[Elves]] considered cooking a delicate art form and their taste buds generally could not handle heavy use of spices. However, among elves the more adventurous youth were known to partake in over-spiced food.\n* [[Cloud giant]]s were known to prefer their food carefully prepared with a variety of spices. Furthermore, those who worshiped the deity [[Stronmaus]] would ritually start each morning by scattering handfuls of spice and [[incense]] into the wind.\n* The [[ghul-kin]] of Zakhara were known to have a fondness for highly spiced meat and stews.<ref>\n* [[Gnome|Gnomish]] cuisine was rarely known to employ spices.\n* [[Halfling]]s did not favor a lot of spices in their food, with the exception of onions. They generally preferred a mixture of herbs over strong spices when it came to seasoning their traditional sausages, [[cheese]]s, stews, and baked goods.\n* [[Rakshasa]] were typically known to season their food with all manner of exotic spices.{{Cite dragon/326/The Ecology of the Rakshasa}}",
            "Regions & Settlements": "* The Calimshan city of [[Suldolphor]] sported an entrance known as the Spice Gate. Also within that city, the [[Shaldizar Inn]] would throw spices on to fires in order to scent the interior air.\n* In the nation of [[Tethyr]], spices were one of many goods that people commonly bartered with.\n* Most travelers in the [[Western Heartlands]] carried varied arrays of the spices that they considered \"base staples.\" These included cinnamon, dill seeds, ground black pepper, ground garlic, nutmeg, or thyme.\n* In the lands further south and east of the Western Heartlands the spices considered \"base staples\" to travelers were ground almonds, ground ginger, dried tamarind, raisins, rosemary, and turmeric."

        "Trivia": "* Among the many valuable items that made up the treasure hoards of some [[dragon]]s and [[roc]]s, spices could be found.\n* Sailors of [[phlogiston]] rarely had good access to spices.\n* The dwarven deity [[Vergadain]] often demonstrated his favor with individuals through unexpected discoveries, most notably of rare spices.<ref>\n* In Zakhara, burning expensive spices could summon a [[Sakina]]."
