Evaelathil was a magical short sword for halflings and one of the baneblades of Demron created in Myth Drannor.
It was a short sword designed for smaller folk such as halflings, weighing 1 pound (0.45 kilograms). When drawn, it glowed as bright as a torch with a soft green light, but this could be shut off at will.
As a baneblade of Demron, it was a +4 holy weapon that was a bane to both undead and evil outsiders. Evaelathil in particular bestowed resistance to fire on its wielder and let them use charm person and locate creature once a day each with command words. However, it was only usable by halflings, and was just a non-magical if well-made sword for anyone else.
Evaelathil was crafted by the archmage Demron before the fall of Myth Drannor, and is the first of his series of baneblades.
