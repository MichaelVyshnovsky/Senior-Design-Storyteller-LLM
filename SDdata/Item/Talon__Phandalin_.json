        "mainbody": "Talon was an enchanted longsword that belonged to the knight, Sir Aldith Tresendar.\nThe sword, which had a +1 enchantment, was beautifully crafted. Its silver hilt was shaped into that of a bird of prey mid-flight.\nIn 951 DR, orcs attacked Tresendar Manor, where the owner of Talon lived. Blackhawk, formally known as Sir Aldith Tresendar, used the longsword to fend off many of the orcs in the caverns of his manor. Blackhawk was slain, and Talon was lost. Over 500 years later, it was found by a nothic that was under command of Iarno Albrek.\n* Aldith Tresendar"
