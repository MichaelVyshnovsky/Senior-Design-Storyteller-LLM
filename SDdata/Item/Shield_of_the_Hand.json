        "mainbody": "'''''Shields of the Hand''''' were masterfully crafted [[tower shield]]s found in the [[Seldarine's Hand]] citadel on the [[Spine of the World]].",
        "Description": "''Shields of the Hand'' were carved with [[elven]] [[rune]]s and forged using the strongest ore from [[Dorn's Deep]].",
        "Powers": "These shields offered supreme protection from enemy arms and were very effective against missiles and ranged weapons.",
        "History": "After completion of construction of Seldarine's Hand ''circa'' [[900 DR]], the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the [[dwarves]] of Dorn's Deep. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best armor and weapons created by the crafters of both races. By [[1281 DR]], the Seldarine's Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadel's fall, several ''shields of the Hand'' remained in existence and could be found inside the ruins until the Severed Hand was transported to [[Limbo]] in [[1306 DR]]."
