        "mainbody": "Shields of the Hand were masterfully crafted tower shields found in the Seldarines Hand citadel on the Spine of the World.\nShields of the Hand were carved with elven runes and forged using the strongest ore from Dorns Deep.\nThese shields offered supreme protection from enemy arms and were very effective against missiles and ranged weapons.\nAfter completion of construction of Seldarines Hand circa 900 DR, the inhabitants of the citadel lived in a close alliance with the dwarves of Dorns Deep. The troops of the elven citadel were outfitted with the best armor and weapons created by the crafters of both races. By 1281 DR, the Seldarines Hand had been ruined for centuries and came to be known as the Severed Hand. After the citadels fall, several shields of the Hand remained in existence and could be found inside the ruins until the Severed Hand was transported to Limbo in 1306 DR."
