        "mainbody": "Maug grafts were special grafts created for the purpose of augmenting maug warriors. While intended for constructs, it was possible to attach them onto other creatures as well.\nGenerally, they were crafted from metal or the stone of Thuldanin, the second layer of the plane of Acheron. Once attached, maug grafts did not radiate magic, and they could generally not be reused if removed.\nOnly maugs understood how such grafts were created, and in particular they were applied by maug spellcasters, such as the ancient Thulkarr. Transforming a creature using maug grafts required experience as a healer, specialized knowledge of how to attach grafts, and often access to one or more relevant spells. The grafts could be sized for even very tiny and very massive recipients.\nNew maugs received a simple graft upon their creation&mdashsuch as a locking hand, shoving arm, or stone spitter&mdashand experienced maug mercenaries would use their amassed treasure to pay for additional upgrades. Maug spellcasters also devised ways to augment creatures of flesh with these grafts, although they reserved such transformations for their followers.\nIn , two maug fighters sporting shoving arm grafts served the Zhentarim as guardians at Castle Krag in Shadowdale.\nLocking hand\nA stone hand that replaced an existing hand. The fingers were designed to lock together, granting the recipient creature an extraordinarily strong grip, however the use of the hand was dexterous enough not to inhibit fine motor control (such as spellcasting gestures).\nRollers\nA creatures legs were replaced by a stone pyramid with six heavy cylinders. This graft limited the creatures mobility to rolling, but could be used to crush enemies.\nShoving arm\nA large piston ending in an open, upright hand replaced an existing arm and was secured to a creatures torso with a stone strap. This arm and hand were useless for most activities save for forcefully pushing or striking enemies or objects.\nShudder plate\nA stone frame was embedded in a creature (usually in the chest) and held a thin square of enchanted shale that would quietly vibrate in tune with the environment, granting a form of tremorsense.\nSpike stones\nSmall round stones were embedded all over a creatures surface. On command, the creature could cause these to elongate into sharp, armor-piercing spikes.\nStone spitter\nA box was affixed to a creatures shoulder with a thin tube extending from the base. This contraption could be used to fire bullets at supernaturally high speeds. It could hold up to 50 bullets at a time, but could only be used to unload its ammunition six times per day."
