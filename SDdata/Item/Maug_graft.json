        "mainbody": "'''Maug grafts''' were special [[graft]]s created for the purpose of augmenting [[maug (construct)|maug]] warriors. While intended for [[construct]]s, it was possible to attach them onto other creatures as well.",
        "Description": {
            "Creation": "Only maugs understood how such grafts were created, and in particular they were applied by maug spellcasters, such as the ancient [[Thulkarr (maug)|Thulkarr]]. Transforming a creature using maug grafts required experience as a healer, specialized knowledge of how to attach grafts, and often access to one or more relevant [[spell]]s. The grafts could be sized for even very tiny and very massive recipients."
        },
        "Users": "New maugs received a simple graft upon their creation&mdash;such as a locking hand, shoving arm, or stone spitter&mdash;and experienced maug mercenaries would use their amassed treasure to pay for additional upgrades. Maug spellcasters also devised ways to augment creatures of flesh with these grafts, although they reserved such transformations for their followers.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1375}}, two maug fighters sporting shoving arm grafts served the [[Zhentarim]] as guardians at [[Castle Krag]] in [[Shadowdale]].",
        "Notable Maug Grafts": ";Locking hand\n:A stone hand that replaced an existing hand. The fingers were designed to lock together, granting the recipient creature an extraordinarily strong grip, however the use of the hand was dexterous enough not to inhibit fine motor control (such as [[somatic component|spellcasting gestures]]).\n;Rollers\n:A creature's legs were replaced by a stone pyramid with six heavy cylinders. This graft limited the creature's mobility to rolling, but could be used to crush enemies.\n;Shoving arm\n:A large piston ending in an open, upright hand replaced an existing arm and was secured to a creature's torso with a stone strap. This arm and hand were useless for most activities save for forcefully pushing or striking enemies or objects.\n;Shudder plate\n:A stone frame was embedded in a creature (usually in the chest) and held a thin square of enchanted [[shale]] that would quietly vibrate in tune with the environment, granting a form of [[tremorsense]].\n;Spike stones\n:Small round stones were embedded all over a creature's surface. On command, the creature could cause these to elongate into sharp, armor-piercing spikes.\n;Stone spitter\n:A box was affixed to a creature's shoulder with a thin tube extending from the base. This contraption could be used to fire [[bullet]]s at supernaturally high speeds. It could hold up to 50 bullets at a time, but could only be used to unload its ammunition six times per day."
