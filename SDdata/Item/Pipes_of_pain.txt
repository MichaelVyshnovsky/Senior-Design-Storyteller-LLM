'''''Pipes of pain''''' were [[enchanted]] [[birdpipes]] that allowed a piper to [[curse]] listeners with hypersensitivity to sound.

==Powers==
These birdpipes carried a faint [[aura]] of [[enchantment]] and [[evocation]].

When played by anyone proficient in musical instruments, these birdpipes would produce a wondrous melody, far surpassing that of any heard before by those within its effective range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. In the hands of a proper [[bard]], the effective range of ''pipes of pain'' was doubled to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.<ref> When played around water, the effect of ''pipes of pain'' extending out to a similar range.<ref>

Those listening to the melody produced by ''pipes of pain'' could fall under an enchantment, a type of mind-affecting compulsion, that stopped them from attacking people, or even any sort of action. As soon as the piper stopped playing, all those that fell under the trance of the ''pipes of pain'' would be cursed with hypersensitivity to sound. The immediate effect of this would be intense pain at even the slightest of sounds for a period of 12 to 48 seconds or 2 to 8 minutes.

After this period, the victim would continue to wince at even the slightest of noises. Consequently, this made victims more vulnerable to sonic-based attacks, such as ''[[sound burst]]''. Removing this curse required typical curse negation solutions, such as the [[spell]] ''[[remove curse]]'', though the spell ''[[forget]]'' would also suffice.

Additionally, earlier iterations of ''pipes of pain'' could potentially affect their piper as well.

==Creation==
Creating a set of ''pipes of pain'' required someone skilled in crafting wondrous items and the spell ''sound burst''. 

==Notable Owners==
* [[Aragauthos]], a [[blue dragon]] that was imprisoned in the depths of [[Undermountain]], had a set of ''pipes of pain'' as part of her treasure horde in [[1358 DR]].
* [[Sumulael]], a powerful [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] [[necromancer]].
