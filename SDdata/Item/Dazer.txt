The Dazer was an enchanted club created for the thugs of Westgate sometime long before 1281 DR.
The Dazer had a +1 enchantment. It also could leave its target stunned for twelve seconds upon a successful strike.
The Dazer was created by Retland, a wizard from the city of Westgate. The club was to be used by thugs in his employ. Retland was well-educated but was nothing but a small-time criminal boss, ruling over the Cobble Boys gang in Westgate. The Cobble Boys was active for about a decade. The menace to several neighborhoods of Westgate was ended by a paladin of Tyr Alistar Lavell who assembled a group of allies to take Retlands thugs down. After the dismantling of Cobble Boys, the Dazer was given to the Church of Tyr and later, to one of Tyrs traveling clerics.
By 1281 DR, the Dazer ended up stashed in the Black Wolf Temple dedicated to Myrkul, deep in the Vale of Shadows of Icewind Dale.
