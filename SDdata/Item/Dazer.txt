The '''''Dazer''''' was an enchanted [[club]] created for the thugs of [[Westgate]] sometime long before [[1281 DR]].

==Powers==
The ''Dazer'' had a ''+1'' enchantment. It also could leave its target stunned for twelve seconds upon a successful strike.

==History==
The ''Dazer'' was created by [[Retland]], a [[wizard]] from the city of Westgate. The club was to be used by thugs in his employ. Retland was well-educated but was nothing but a small-time criminal boss, ruling over the [[Cobble Boys]] gang in Westgate. The Cobble Boys was active for about a decade. The menace to several neighborhoods of Westgate was ended by a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] [[Alistar Lavell]] who assembled a group of allies to take Retland's thugs down. After the dismantling of Cobble Boys, the ''Dazer'' was given to the [[Church of Tyr]] and later, to one of Tyr's traveling [[cleric]]s.

By 1281 DR, the ''Dazer'' ended up stashed in the [[Black Wolf Temple]] dedicated to [[Myrkul]], deep in the [[Vale of Shadows]] of [[Icewind Dale]].
