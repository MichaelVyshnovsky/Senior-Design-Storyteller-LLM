        "mainbody": "The sitting monkey was a magical chalice carved in the shape of a monkey. It was one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, a collection of magical vessels created by the Han people of Koryo in ancient times.\nTo use the sitting monkey, one had to hold a ceremony at midnight, in which they burned incense inside the cup and made a certain, strange chant. In return, they received greater skill in climbing, an overall boost to abilities that depended on experience, and the power to use the true seeing spell like a shukenja one time a day.\nA user had to perform this ceremony nightly in order to retain these powers. However, if they continued this regimen for six months or more, they suffered a permanent change their toes became as prehensile as a monkeys, able to naturally grasp things like branches, ledges, and ropes. This made it uncomfortable to wear shoes.\nAs one of the Wo-ha Ui-jung, the sitting bulls powers had most likely at one stage influenced the history of Koryo. However, it was later lost.\nIn the midâ€“14th century DR, King Wanang Sun led an expedition to recover three of the Wo-ha Ui-jung. He was successful, discovering the sitting bull, sitting monkey, and standing deer by 1357 DR. He kept the sitting monkey stored in his treasure rooms."
