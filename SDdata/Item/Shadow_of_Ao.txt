==Abilities==
Legend had that the ''Shadow of Ao'' had the power to rejoin Abeir and Toril. 

==History==
It was believed by a few [[Abeir]]ans that the ''Shadow of Ao'' was lost during the [[Tearfall|last conflict]] between the [[god]]s and the [[primordial]]s. A few believed that the ''Shadow of Ao'' was hidden in the lands of [[Laerakond]].
