The '''Tumulus''' was the name given to a massive and mysterious egg-like object buried deep in the [[Northdark]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
While much of the Tumulus remained interred in the earth, one end of it emerged in a cavern situated some {{SI|100|mile|k|long=yes}} east of [[Waterdeep]] and {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}} beneath the surface, in the [[middledark]].

==Description==
From the curved upper end, it was estimated to be an ovoid structure of solid stone and measuring approximately {{SI|2000|ft|long=yes}} from end to end. The exposed surface was carved all over with symbols, sigils, glyphs, and signsâ€”all of them meaning 'death' in countless languages, some identified, some not. A number of these carried deadly [[spell]]s that would kill anyone who even saw them. Many, but not all, have already been discharged, but more could still be active under the earth.

==History==
While its origin and purpose were unknown, the Tumulus was thought to be older than even the elven realm of [[Illefarn]],

Over the ages, by [[1372 DR]], a few efforts had been undertaken to find an entrance, none of them determined, let alone successful.

==Rumors & Legends==
The structure was rumored to be cemetery or tomb of some kind, hence its name, but this was unconfirmed.
