The Spinal Tap was a tavern located in the southern Ring Caverns that catered to mind flayers.
The drinks of the tavern were made with cerebrospinal fluids flavored with various fungal additives and a little alcohol.
Typically, the tavern was supplied with entertainment by one or more thrivenists who played a unique illithid instrument called a bonethriven.
