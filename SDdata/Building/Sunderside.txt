'''Sunderside''' was a small but palatial mansion owned by the [[Ampner]] family of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], located within the city's [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]]. Despite its size, the manor was divided into unassuming rental apartments that were particularly well-decorated. The noble Ampners maintained one of the suits as a sort of domestic getaway, when they wished to stay in the city without letting others know of their whereabouts. 

The manor was located on the corner of [[Waelstar Way]] and [[Dragonscale Street]] in the [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood.
