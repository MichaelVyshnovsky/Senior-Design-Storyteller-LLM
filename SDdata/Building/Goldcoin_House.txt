The Goldcoin House was the Waukeenar shrine built in the small town of Asbravn. Both the town and shrine were situated in an out-of-the-way region of Sunset Vale, at the junction of the Dusk Road and the Uldoon Trail.
It was one of several shrines found in town, including those dedicated to Lathander and Llira, built around the more prominent House of the Suffering God, a temple dedicated to Ilmater.
