        "Location": "The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the much larger [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] (formerly a temple of [[Bhaal]]) and the [[Temple of Tempus (Bezantur)|Temple of Tempus]] to the west, the [[Temple of Talos (Bezantur)|Temple of Talos]] to the north, the grand [[Temple of Kossuth (Bezantur)|Temple of Kossuth]] to the east, and the [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Temple of Tyr]] and [[Temple of Lloth (Bezantur)|Temple of Lolth]] to the south.",
        "Structure": "The temple was a well-maintained, jet-black building.",
        "Activities": "The temple hosted religious services to Bane",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], not only did all other temples of Bane in Thay report to the high priest of the temple in Bezantur, but the the Thayan clergies of [[church of Bhaal|Bhaal]], [[church of Iyachtu Xvim|Iyachtu Xvim]], and [[church of Loviatar|Loviatar]] did as well. The [[Red Wizards]] were wary of the temple as they suspected it was an ally of the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the high priest of the temple had begun to see the Red Wizards as blasphemers who would strive to become [[god]]s themselves rather than submit to Bane. He called upon Bane to punish these heathens, and in response, [[Iyachtu Xvim]] himself was tasked with inserting himself into the Thayan power struggles to begin smiting the Red Wizards.\n\nFollowing Bane's death in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the dead [[god]]'s popularity remained high enough that a small contingent of [[priest]]s continued to maintain the temple and to pray for his return, even leading ceremonies in his name.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, the high priest was an influential figure who was believed to be an agent of [[Zhentil Keep]]. As of the late 1360s DR, the temple was headed by a high priestess named [[Cothra]] who actually worshiped [[Iyachtu Xvim]]."
