        "mainbody": "he Temple of Bane in Bezantur was the center of Thayan worship of Bane in the 14 century DR.\nThe temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the much larger House of Cyric (formerly a temple of Bhaal) and the Temple of Tempus to the west, the Temple of Talos to the north, the grand Temple of Kossuth to the east, and the Temple of Tyr and Temple of Lolth to the south.\nThe temple was a well-maintained, jet-black building.\nThe temple hosted religious services to Bane\nPrior to the Time of Troubles, not only did all other temples of Bane in Thay report to the high priest of the temple in Bezantur, but the the Thayan clergies of Bhaal, Iyachtu Xvim, and Loviatar did as well. The Red Wizards were wary of the temple as they suspected it was an ally of the Zhentarim.\nIn the , the high priest of the temple had begun to see the Red Wizards as blasphemers who would strive to become gods themselves rather than submit to Bane. He called upon Bane to punish these heathens, and in response, Iyachtu Xvim himself was tasked with inserting himself into the Thayan power struggles to begin smiting the Red Wizards.\nFollowing Banes death in the , the dead gods popularity remained high enough that a small contingent of priests continued to maintain the temple and to pray for his return, even leading ceremonies in his name.\nIn the mid&ndash14 century DR, the high priest was an influential figure who was believed to be an agent of Zhentil Keep. As of the late 1360s DR, the temple was headed by a high priestess named Cothra who actually worshiped Iyachtu Xvim."
