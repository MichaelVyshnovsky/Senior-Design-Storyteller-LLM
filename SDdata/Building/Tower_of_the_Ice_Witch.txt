The Black Ice Tower or the Tower of the Ice Witch was a solitary tower, located on a patch of ice in the Sea of Moving Ice, made of black ice and malevolent energy leftover from the Crenshinibon. It was the home of Hedrun Arnsfirth, the Ice Witch of the North.
The threeâ€”story tower resembled massive piece of quartz, over 100 feet (30.5 meters) tall. Rather than appear as semi-translucent however, the tower was an opaque black color.
Starting at ground level, the tower comprised a main chamber in which Hedrun held audience with others, a shrine to Auril referred to as the Temple of the Storm, and Hedruns personal living quarters.
