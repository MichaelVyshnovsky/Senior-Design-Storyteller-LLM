'''The Black Ice Tower''' or the '''Tower of the Ice Witch''' was a solitary tower, located on a patch of ice in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], made of [[black ice]] and malevolent energy leftover from the [[Crenshinibon]]. It was the home of [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]], the Ice Witch of [[the North]].

==Structure==
The threeâ€”story tower resembled massive piece of [[Rock crystal|quartz]], over 100 feet (30.5 meters) tall. Rather than appear as semi-translucent however, the tower was an opaque black color.

==Interior==
Starting at ground level, the tower comprised a main chamber in which Hedrun held audience with others, a shrine to [[Auril]] referred to as the ''Temple of the Storm'', and Hedrun's personal living quarters.
