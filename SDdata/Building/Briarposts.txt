Briarposts was a hunting lodge in the north-western part of Sembia.
The lodges name reflected that the entire vicinity ensconced in briars.
Positioned eastward of Tegals Mark, the hunting lodge could be found just over the border within Sembia in a dusky pine woodland.
Briarposts carried tales of being haunted by "clutching ghosts" obedient to a powerful spellcasting dweller. These creatures might have been cloakers or something more terrible.
It was said that the unknown resident was engaged in trade with drow and granted them access to the surface through the building.
