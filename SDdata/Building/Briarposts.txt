'''Briarposts''' was a hunting lodge in the north-western part of [[Sembia]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-28 - Briarposts}}

==Name==
The lodge's name reflected that the entire vicinity ensconced in briars.

==Location==
Positioned eastward of [[Tegal's Mark]], the hunting lodge could be found just over the border within Sembia in a dusky [[pine]] woodland.

==Rumors & Legends==
Briarposts carried tales of being haunted by "clutching ghosts" obedient to a powerful [[Spell|spellcasting]] dweller. These creatures might have been [[cloaker]]s or something more terrible.

It was said that the unknown resident was engaged in trade with [[drow]] and granted them access to the surface through the building.
