While there they were able to find refuge within the walls of the Fireshear Inn.\n\nSometime between 1358 and [[1365 DR]] the inn presumably shut down, for while there [[Volothamp Geddarm]] remarked in his book ''[[Volo's Guide to the North (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to the North]]'' that the mining settlement was completely lacking in any sort of inn.<ref>"
