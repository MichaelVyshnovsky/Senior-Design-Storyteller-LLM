        "mainbody": "The Ringfork Stronghold was an orcish fortification in the Trielta Hills of the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.\nBy the , the Ringfork Stronghold was ruled by Lord Heradd, who was believed to have had his sights on usurping leadership of the two other orcish communities of the Trielta Hills. The fort was approached by an agent of the Cult of the Absolute in the , who sought to recruit Lord Heradds orcs into the cults army. Agent Mhoss, the first envoy, was dismembered by Lord Heradds guardâ€”an act that led to the cults re-evaluation of their strategy. Sir Yax of Scornubel was decided to be the next envoy as he was familiar with orcish traditions and culture. Yaxs strategy was to arrive accompanied by two ogres and issue a personal challenge to Lord Heradd for the killing of Agent Mhoss. Yax then would have to defeat the orcish lord, force him to swear allegiance to the Absolute, and, in exchange, the cult would offer Lord Heradd an alliance in conquering the other two orcish communities of the Trielta Hills."
