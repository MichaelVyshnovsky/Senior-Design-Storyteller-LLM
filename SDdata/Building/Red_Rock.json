        "mainbody": "he Red Rock was a stone and wood inn located in Dagger Falls run by the half-elven ex-minstrel Kessla.  \nThe taproom of the Red Rock was illuminated by magical globes of light rather than candles, courtesy of Kesslas magic. \nThe Red Rock survived inspections from the Zhentarim and countless brawls that would erupt inside. Despite this, it was burned to the ground by an army of orcs. The Lord of Daggerdale Randal Morn did not have enough money to rebuild the inn, though some adventurers lent money to Kessla for restoration before 1367 DR.\nKessla was assisted by a stable boy named Orthran and two waitresses, Larstiira and Jandylgrae."
