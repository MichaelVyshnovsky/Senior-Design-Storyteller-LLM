The '''Leaf in Root''' was a [[tobacco]] and pipe shop located within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was famous across [[North Faerûn|north]] and [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] provided by the Leaf's secretive and often-absent proprietor, [[Oscar Sodhome]]. People came from throughout [[the Vast]], and lands as far away as the [[Dalelands]] and [[Sembia]], for the shop's unique products.

The red brick building was located on the corner of [[Rhabie Promenade]] and [[Dragonscale Street]] in the neighborhood of [[Swordspoint]].

==Description==
No products within the store were labeled with a price tag, as Oscar expected his customers to name their cost for what they wanted. If an acceptable or high price was offered, Oscar or Chug would agree, though not without a moment of false reservation. The [[halfling]] duo were ready hagglers, and would never go under their set prices.

Busy from dawn until dusk, the shop featured a noticeboard where Ravenian folk could post job requests for mercenaries, adventurers, or the many other hirelings that were rampant throughout Ravens Bluff. Oscar believed this greatly helped to bring in new customers and patrons.

==Staff==
Oscar ran the shop with the help of his assistant [[Willy Milman|Chug]], a heavy-drinking, [[shield]]-loving, and particularly pessimistic [[halfling]].

==Services==
The Leaf in Root offered common pipes, carved from briar, or much to Oscar's chagrin, clay, as well as the "Sodhome's Specials". These highly demanded pipes crafted by Oscar were carved from a secret root, only known to him. Most were made to his design and liking, but if given enough gold, he would create custom pieces.

Tobaccos of all sorts were commonly sold within the store. These ranged from common varieties to the more exotic. It was known to the shop's patrons that Oscar could get his hands on just about any variety of leaf found across [[Faerûn]]. Specially ordered types of tobacco would take a month or two to arrive at the Leaf in Root and custom-crafted pipes could take anywhere from five weeks to eight months, depending on the intricacy and detail of the carving.

In addition to their unique types of [[tobacco]], and handcrafted pipes, the Leaf sold various accessories for the avid smoking enthusiast including [[tinderbox]]es, flint, tobacco and [[herb]] tins and pouches, as well as pipe stands.
