        "mainbody": "he Temple of Ra was an abandoned temple to Ra in the city of Medinat Muskawoon.\nThe temple of Ra lay southwest of the banks of the Meat Halwa, approximately 300 feet away.\nThe temples entrance was flanked by two great pylons of red stone which bore gigantic depictions of eyes. Beyond the entrance, a colonnade was visible, which delimitated a courtyard each pillar was topped by a blossom with many petals. The far wall of the court was topped by columns much larger than those of the colonnade, holding up the temple roof in the midle of the far wall, a wide portico opened into the entry hall. The pillars, and the dint of the portico, were green stone the stone of the wall was pink, while the blossoms were rendered in black stone.\nPast the entrance lay an entry hall, somewhat cool and dark compared to outside. It was  by , with a  wide and  tall doorway in the center of the far wall the stone arch was black marble, fully five feet thick, joining seamlessly with the darkness beyond.\nCrossing the final doorway led to a zone where the floor had been replaced by a bottomless, churning void. An altar lay in the middle of that room, holding the Star of Melos-Pelar.\nThe temple was thick with Marteks enchantments, and no magic other than that of his could be counted on there. The Eyes of Hathor would freeze anyone who approached the temple to recover the Star Gem of Melos-Pelar, the courtyard would fill with snakes that would only be repelled with the flame from the Temple of Prometheus the entry halls mist would charm anyone who did not fly over it with Horus gift, and the void around the altar would be best bypassed with the enchanted golden drainage grates from the baths around the city of Medinat Muskawoon. If all fourteen were collected and used to make a bridge, however, the last one would disappear, echoing the legend of Isis and Osiris fleeing Set."
