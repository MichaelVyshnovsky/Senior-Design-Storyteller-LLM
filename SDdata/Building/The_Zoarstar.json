        "mainbody": "The Zoarstar was the guildhall of a Waterdhavian guild known as the Scriveners, Scribes, & Clerks Guild.\nThis guildhall was located along the northwest corner Quill Alley and the Wide Way, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.  It was northwest of the Court of the White Bull.\nThis guildhall was three-stories tall.\nOn the second floor of this building was a library with a two-way portal that linked to a library hidden within a dwarf hold down in the Maze Level of Undermountain.\nThe Zoarstar was among some of the more notable and recognizable guildhalls in the Trades Ward. \nPeople frequently crowded around its windows to look in at its maps, charts, and architectural renderings that were all displayed on easels at its front. One of these maps was always an overall view of the city itself. At times there were even maps on display of far off lands, such as Maztica."
