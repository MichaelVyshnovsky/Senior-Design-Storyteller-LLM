The '''Temple of Odin''' in the city of [[Bral]] was perhaps the only shrine to the god [[Odin]] in [[Realmspace]].

==Description==
The Temple of Odin was actually a small shrine, but it was one of the oldest on the [[Rock of Bral]] and was well-respected.

==Location==
The temple was located in the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]] on the starboard side of [[Grand Street]], near the port-side entrance to the [[Lesser Market]].

==Congregation==
It was debatable whether or not the [[priest]] of Odin could even communicate with his god,â€”had a presence in Realmspace. However, by the end of the 14{{th}} century, the congregation of worshipers at the shrine numbered about 100.

==History==
The shrine was founded in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by vikings from another world who were transported to [[Realmspace]] by an enigmatic space storm.
