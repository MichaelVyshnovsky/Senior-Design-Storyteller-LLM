The '''Tani Shrine''' was a shrine found in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century.

==Description==
The Tani Shrine was a secluded valley shrine originally constructed by the inhabitants of a village that since vanished. Despite the disappearance of its creators, the shrine continued to be cared for by an elderly [[shukenja]], who had chosen this serene location as his final dwelling place. Finding peace in the solitude of the shrine, by {{YearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, he had recently become captivated by the mystery surrounding the fate of the original village and its people.

The ancient records preserved within the shrine made mention of a village in close proximity, yet despite his efforts, the shukenja was unable to uncover any physical evidence of its existence. It appeared that some form of potent and enigmatic magic has erased the village from the landscape. The lingering magical aura in the area hinted at the involvement of a malevolent force, suggesting that the disappearance of the village was not a natural or accidental event but rather the result of a deliberate and evil act. Intrigued by this puzzle, the shukenja became dedicated to unraveling the truth behind the vanishing of the village and the dark magic that facilitated it.
