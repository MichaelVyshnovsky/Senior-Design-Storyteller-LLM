        "mainbody": "he Five Flagons Inn was a three-floored inn in the Guards District of Athkatla that was known for its entertainment. It was mainly occupied by wealthy customers.\nThe inn had three floors, although the top floor and cellar floor were a lot larger than the serving room. The entrance led to the service room, which had a typical bar and sold a variety of beverages. The bar room joined onto Udas kitchen, which contained several counters and two cooking stoves.\nThe cellar floor had many rooms. The entryway held a ticket booth, where customers could purchase tickets for the theater. The main room held a large stage, with many props such as a musical harp. Behind the stage was the actors prep room, which contained dressers and make-up stands. The final room was a fairly big storage area, and was connected to both the theater and prep room.\nThe top floor was very large, and could accommodate many patrons. The master bedroom contained a luxury bed, living area and a grand piano. Its walls were adorned with many expensive paintings. The intermediate room contained two large canvassed wagons, which had been turned into decorations. It also contained a pipe organ and storage boxes. As well as numerous bedrooms, there was a couple of dining areas.\nThe inn had a standard bar, manned by the enthusiastic halfling Samuel Thunderburp. He claimed that they had every beverage in Faer√ªn, but they actually had quite a limited selection. The tavern rented out rooms of all standards, and accommodated for everyone, from peasants to nobles.\nThe main attraction was the underground theater, where three to four actors would perform for customers, particularly wealthy nobles."
