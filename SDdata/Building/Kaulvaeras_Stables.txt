'''Kaulvaeras Stables''' was a large horse farm located on the western side of [[Ashabenford]], right on the east bank of the [[River Ashaba]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}} These renowned stables offered some of the finest [[horse]]s in the [[Dalelands]], and was run by one their better horse breeders, [[Kaulvaeras Greymantle]]. They set very fair prices, considering the quality of their steeds.

The Kaulvaeras Stables selection of mounts only included [[ponies]], horses, and sometime warhorses, personally bred and reared by Kaulvaeras himself. Anyone looking to trade in a lame mount would receive a discount on their purchase. Kaulvaeras was far too soft-hearted to put down any tired horses and instead set them out to pasture.
