        "mainbody": "Felzouns Folly was a tavern in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis tavern was located along Salabar Street, on the northwestern corner of where River Square opened into it.\nFelzouns Folly stood three-stories tall and featured many windows. Outside it was festooned with many awnings.\nThis tavern was frequently quite crowded and noisy, but overall was a casual place where merchants and consumers alike stopped for a quick bite or drink.\nThe provender on offer at this tavern included sausage rolls and chicken-and-cheese pasties, accompanied by either fresh asparagus with melted butter (when in season) or fresh whole oysters. Some considered it a tradition to eat the oysters at this establishment raw. This standard fare cost around 4 silver pieces, though one could also purchase a plate of more seasonal delicacies for 6 silver pieces.\nIn terms of drinks, Felzouns Folly did not have a great variety. One could purchase ale at 1 silver piece a tankard or 2 silver pieces a stout, as well as wine and zzar for 4 silver pieces a tallglass. The wines on offer included six white wines, such as Neverwinter Nectar, and three red wines.\nIn the year 1492 DR, the elderly Uza Solizeph trapped a gazer within her bookstore on Sorn Street. Knowing the City Watch would not aid her, due to her propensity for telling tall tales, the woman went to drown her sorrows at Felzouns Folly. She was later met there by members of the Harpers, an organization that owed her a favor, who offered to handle the aberration.\nRumors floated around that one could fence stolen goods at this establishment. In truth the proprietor, Felzoun Thar, was the point of contact for anyone looking to do business with the fence Haerlit Thomm."
