The Rotten Root Tavern was a dive on Silverpiece Way in Westgate that, as of 1480 DR, had been in business for over 100 years. 
The establishment was best known for its bad food and drink and its sign depicting an evil-looking treant.
The bar was the favorite hangout of Kalen Dren when he was in Westgate.
The Rotten Root was located in the west section of the city on both Silverpiece Way and North Ssemm Spur.
