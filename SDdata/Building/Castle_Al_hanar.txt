Castle Alhanar was a ruined fortress located in the Toadsquat Mountains on the border of the Sharawood, built during the time of the Kingdom of Eltabranar. It was rumored to contain more magic in one location than any other place since the reign of the Imaskari.
This castle was once the base of the Knights of the Eternal Dragon, an order of Myrkul, who swore themselves to the destruction of the Everlasting Wyrm.
