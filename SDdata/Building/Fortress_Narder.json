It was destroyed during the last great conflict with Raumathar by some unidentified [[spell]] that reduced it to rubble.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}} a foul taint seeped out of the ruined fortress, poisoning the water and soil in the land around, and foul creatures crept out from the ruins, hunting and slaying the wildlife nearby. In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the leader of the [[Circle of Leth]], the self-proclaimed [[Nentyarch]], feared that the poisoning was due to a [[demoncyst]] located somewhere beneath the ruins, as [[hezrou]] [[demons]] were encountered lurking in the depths of the ancient fortress.<ref>"
