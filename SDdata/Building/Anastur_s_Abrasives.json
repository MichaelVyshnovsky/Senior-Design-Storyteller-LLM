        "Services": "[[Baelen Anastur]] sent out [[human]] and [[gnome]] prospectors across the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] to find particular minerals such as [[manganese]] and [[iron]] oxides, mixed with secret blends of [[oil]]s to make fine abrasive polishes. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in [[Secomber]], who used their polishes for finishing the raw blades of [[Arthane Furnace]] products such as [[longsword]]s."
