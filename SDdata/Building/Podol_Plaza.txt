'''Podol Plaza''' was the open-air market plaza in the city of [[Phlan]], located on the [[Podol Street]], right by the city gates overlooking the [[Valhingen Graveyard]] to the city's north.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}}

==Description==
Podol Plaza was historically the busiest and biggest marketplace in Phlan. It was strategically constructed to be by the main gates, giving an easy access to travelers and traders, it was close to the warehouses, and the city's docks. The plaza organically became the center for trade. Banking houses of Old Phlan were located around the plaza.[[File:Old phlan - podol plaza.png|thumb|''The layout of Podol Plaza circa 1340 DR, in the ruined Old Phlan.'']]

==Services==
Apart from copious trade from all around Faerun, young kids were known to sell wide sheets of [[paper]] on the corners of the plaza with the day's news for 1 [[cp]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1340 DR]], the city was laid in ruins and Podol Plaza was still used as a trading post for [[orc]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[goblin]]s, that reigned over the Old Phlan. In 1340 DR, the goblinoids of the ruined Phlan held a big auction to sell a powerful magical item they looted from one of the secret locations of the city. The auction attracted the attention of "the Boss", the possessing spirit [[Tyranthraxus]] himself. The evil master of the ruins did not attend the auction however. Instead, he sent his [[wizard]] lackey [[Garwin]] the Mage and his bodyguard, the [[ogre]] [[Buldwar]].

In [[1367 DR]], the city of [[Phlan]] went through an economic boom after the hardships the city suffered from the slew of threats like wars, the coming of Tyranthraxus, and the seizure by [[Bane]]. The areas of the city destroyed and damaged by those threats were being rebuilt to serve the citizens and guests of Phlan once again.
