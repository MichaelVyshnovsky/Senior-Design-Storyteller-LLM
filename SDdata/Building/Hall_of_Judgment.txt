The Hall of Judgment was the center of judicial administration in Eileanar, the enclave of Karsus.
The Hall was responsible for holding the trials of accused individual in the city, according to the laws of Karsus Enclave. Suspects were questioned and examined, and witnesses and evidence acquired in order to properly perform a trial to the exacting standards of the responsible judges. Lord High Justice Andoris Derathar was the most highly ranked official of the justice system, and typically took only the most serious and grave cases involving espionage and murder. High Justice Emilus Wentar and Justice Vlourir also presided over cases, calling in more senior judges as necessary to handle complex cases.
The Spiral Court was one of the main courtrooms of the Hall, named for its unusual architecture. It was a circular chamber named for an ivory inlay two paces wide that spiraled around the wall. As statements were made by those involved in the trial, images of the words were transcribed onto the ivory in black letters and flowed up from the floor level. In addition, the gravity plane of the room was altered, and the wall itself served as a floor for public spectators to view the proceedings from, or read the transcription up close.
The presiding judge sat upon a floating silver chair, and looked down at the floor where the accused were held. The suspected criminals were contained within carefully-crafted magic circles that were painted in the form of mazes, using brushes made from three braided tail hairs from minotaurs. If the accused attempted to escape, they would be subject to a being trapped in a maze.
