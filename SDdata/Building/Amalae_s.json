        "mainbody": "Amalaes was a beauty shop in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis building stood at the northwestern end of the culdesac The Boomgarden.\nThe proprietors of this shop offered baths, hair-washing, hair-stylings, \"touches\" (manicures and pedicures), and other cosmetic applications within separate rooms of the building.\nAdditionally, those who worked here would offer patrons a fee to share a bed with them for the night or to rent out their attic. Some wizards were known to rent out this attic so they could conduct private spell-study.\nThis shop was lived in and run by Amalae and her six housemates."
