        "mainbody": "he Mosque of Brave Hajama was located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThis temple could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.\nThe first floor of the mosque was the main worship area. This area was decorated with a pair of lions that were chained to the main door. It was widely rumored that the lions would attack anyone with fear in their heart. In truth, the lions were bored most of the time.\nThe basement of the mosque housed the clerical brethren.\nThe dome of the mosque opened to the sky, allowing the faithful a splendid view of the sunset.\nHigh Priest Imam Jomhur was the head of the mosque. He supervised around 200 lesser-ranking priests of Hajama and laymen.\nSince Hajama was a popular god in Huzuz, services in his mosque were well-attended."
