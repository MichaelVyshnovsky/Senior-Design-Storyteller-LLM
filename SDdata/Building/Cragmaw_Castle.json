It had a well-protected main entrance, with two archer posts looking straight at any who would approach the castle. Cragmaw Castle also had a side entrance to the south that was far less guarded.\nThe inside of the building had several traps laid around. The rooms consisted of barracks, storage areas, a banquet hall, a shrine to Maglubiyet, and the quarters of King Grol.\nAfter its initial construction, humans inhabited the castle.\nIn the 15 century DR, it was inhabited by goblins, hobgoblins, a bugbear, a grick, a wolf, and an owlbear, and visited by a doppleganger disguised as a drow elf.\nthumb|300px|A dinner party at Cragmaw Castle.Though the castle later took the the name of the Cragmaw tribe in the 15 century DR, it was originally built by a noble wizard of Phalorm, and not the goblinoids.\nIn 1491 DR, Cragmaw Castle was the home of King Grol of the Cragmaw tribe, before King Grol was slain by adventurers."
