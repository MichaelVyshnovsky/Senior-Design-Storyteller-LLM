Malcor Grannox, who was one of the richest [[Tethyr]]ians of his day, purchased the manor along with many other abused or ruined properties to have them restored, long before [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda]] rose to power and appointed him the count. He personally worked on the carpentry needed for its restoration.",
