The '''Barber Shop of Gorar al-Aksar''' was a prominent fixture of the [[Grand Bazaar]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The walls of the barber shop were festooned with astrological charts and graphs. [[Gorar al-Aksar]] owned a unique smoking [[efreeti]] bottle that he kept on display near his work area. In addition to being a delightful collector's piece, the bottle proved that at least a few of Gorar's lavish tales were true.

==Activities==
Gorar's shop was always full of customers. The talkative [[barber]] gave them their horoscopes whether they wanted one or not.

==History==
As of 1367 DR, the shop had been in the Grand Bazaar for 40 years.

==Inhabitants==
Gorar owned and operated this establishment.
