The Barber Shop of Gorar al-Aksar was a prominent fixture of the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The walls of the barber shop were festooned with astrological charts and graphs. Gorar al-Aksar owned a unique smoking efreeti bottle that he kept on display near his work area. In addition to being a delightful collectors piece, the bottle proved that at least a few of Gorars lavish tales were true.
Gorars shop was always full of customers. The talkative barber gave them their horoscopes whether they wanted one or not.
As of 1367 DR, the shop had been in the Grand Bazaar for 40 years.
Gorar owned and operated this establishment.
