Halamars Horses was a stable run by Blasko Halamar.
The stables were located on the eastern side of Beliard, east of the Stone Bridge in the Savage Frontier of Faer√ªn.
Around 1368 DR to 1370 DR, Blasko, an ex-warrior, ran the place with a dozen local boys, including Hagarl, purchasing lame or tired horses and selling fresh and rested ones as replacements for traveling adventurers.
Halamar was known for buying horses and reselling, but he would always try to keep a ten gold piece profit margin for himself between payments and prices.
*Horses sold for 25 gp
*Oxen and mules sold for 20 gp
*Lame or tired animals bought for 12 gp
