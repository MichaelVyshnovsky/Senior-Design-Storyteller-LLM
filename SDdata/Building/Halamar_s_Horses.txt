'''Halamar's Horses''' was a stable run by [[Blasko Halamar]].

==Geography==
The stables were located on the eastern side of [[Beliard]], east of the [[Stone Bridge]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] of [[Faer√ªn]].

==History==
Around [[1368 DR]] to [[1370 DR]], Blasko, an ex-[[warrior]], ran the place with a dozen local boys, including [[Hagarl]], purchasing lame or tired [[horse]]s and selling fresh and rested ones as replacements for traveling adventurers.

==Services==
Halamar was known for buying horses and reselling, but he would always try to keep a ten gold piece profit margin for himself between payments and prices.

==Prices==
*Horses sold for 25 gp
*[[Ox]]en and [[mule]]s sold for 20 gp
*Lame or tired animals bought for 12 gp
