'''Magis Tor''' was a grouping of five interconnected towers found in the [[Forest of Mir]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Location==
Magis Tor stood in the northeastern part of the Forest of Mir, north of the [[Marching Mountains]], between the ruins of [[Vorpal Tower]], 45 miles to the west, and [[Alisiwhann]] to the east.

==Structure==
The five towers that comprised the Magis Tor were monolithic structures with no doors or windows. Four towers were placed around the central spire that was elevated {{SI|30'|'"|long=yes}} off the gourd. The corner towers connected to the central spire by covered archways.

==History==
Magis Tor served as the base for a group of adventuring [[mage]]s of Tethyr known as [[Magis Mir]]. Before the {{YearlinkName|1347}} and the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], members of Magis Mir were opponents of all malevolent [[undead]] creatures and the infamous [[Twisted Rune]]. Magis Mir went missing seven months after they defeated Runecount [[Tuvos Akasi]] during the Ten Black Days. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the adventuring band had not been seen nor heard from since their disappearance. It was believed that Magis Tor could only be entered by the individuals wearing a special [[ring]]. Each member of Magis Mir had one such ring in their possessions.
