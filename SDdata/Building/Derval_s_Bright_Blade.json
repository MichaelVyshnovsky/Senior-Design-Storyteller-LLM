        "mainbody": "Dervals Bright Blade was a weapon-smithy in Daggerford on the Sword Coast in the late 1360s DR, owned by the dwarf master smith Derval Ironeater.\nOf the smithies in town, Dervals was the best and largest, and certainly better than Cromach and Wayfel. His work was much sought after by fighters, and considered the best anywhere between Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep. Derval would say so himself.\nIt lay in Daggerfords Money Quarter on the High Road, between Kryptgarden Scrolls and Cromachs house, and behind the Jewelers Congress.\nIt was a large building, with pale-brown walls and roof tiles and gabled dormers on the attic level.\nThe sign that hung above the entrance to Dervals store was decorated with a branded image of an anvil on the signs wood. The sign was unkept but its design showed meticulous skill.\nThe backyard of the smithy was full of tools that Ironeater dwarves had created and used for stone construction projects around Daggerford over the years.\nAt the smithy, Derval focused on weaponry, forging swords, axes, and spear heads. His prices were high compared to other weaponsmiths.\nDervals Bright Blade was well established by 1367 DR, and still going strong through 1370 DR."
