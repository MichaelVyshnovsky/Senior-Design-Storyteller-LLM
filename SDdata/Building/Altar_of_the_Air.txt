The Altar of the Air was a shrine to the goddess Akadi built over a crypt in the center of the ruins of the city of Dashadjen.
The mummified priestess of Akadi, El Sadhara, resided there.
Some unknown power protected the shrine from the destructive power of the sands of the Calim Desert, and the Altar and its tombs below were said to contain treasures and magic unimaginable.
The structure was built by lesser djinn during the time of Coramshan to honor the djinni Calim, and much of its elemental treasures awaited his supposed return.
