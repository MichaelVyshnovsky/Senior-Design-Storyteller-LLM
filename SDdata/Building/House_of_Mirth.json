This inn was advertised only by a red tile set beside the door.\nIts main room was long and narrow, several steps up from the rest of the street. It was well-appointed, with large cushions, small tables, and an elegant carpet. The illumination came from niches in the walls.\nThe establishment was of middling quality, in between that of the Inn of the Golden Palm and the Swayback Camel. The meals were reasonable and the clientele was not dangerous.\nThe proprietor was Tasha Lal, who employed three women.\n*Tasha Lal"
