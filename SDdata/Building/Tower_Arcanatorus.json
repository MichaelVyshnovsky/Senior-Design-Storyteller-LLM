        "mainbody": "The '''Tower Arcanatorus''' was a tower of the fortress-city of [[Ascalhorn]], later known as [[Hellgate Keep]], and was one of three sites that remained of the fortress following its destruction in [[1369 DR]]. Out of the three sites, it was the only one that looked to be whole on the outside.",
        "Location": "This tower stood in the southwestern corner of Hellgate Keep, in the quater of Ascalhorn where the [[wizard]]s who practiced [[tanar'ri]] summoning lived.",
        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "In its destroyed state, the timbers and stone of the Tower Arcanatorus creaked ominously with every step, though they were wedged into their configuration and therefore posed no threat of collapsing. Beyond the entryway was an antechamber and cloak room, the former of which was almost filled with debris from the upper floors all collapsing down onto the ground floor.\n\nThe cloak room had a hidden trap door with a spiral stairwell,"
