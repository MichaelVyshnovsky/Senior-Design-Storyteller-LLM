        "mainbody": "The Tower Arcanatorus was a tower of the fortress-city of Ascalhorn, later known as Hellgate Keep, and was one of three sites that remained of the fortress following its destruction in 1369 DR. Out of the three sites, it was the only one that looked to be whole on the outside.\nThis tower stood in the southwestern corner of Hellgate Keep, in the quater of Ascalhorn where the wizards who practiced tanarri summoning lived.\nThis stone tower was directly connected to Hellgate Keeps curtain wall. Following 1369 DR, it still supported short spans of it on either side and it was partially covered in vines. At the base of these walls was a doorway, leading to a door beneath ground level into the tower.\nIn its destroyed state, the timbers and stone of the Tower Arcanatorus creaked ominously with every step, though they were wedged into their configuration and therefore posed no threat of collapsing. Beyond the entryway was an antechamber and cloak room, the former of which was almost filled with debris from the upper floors all collapsing down onto the ground floor.\nThe cloak room had a hidden trap door with a spiral stairwell,"
