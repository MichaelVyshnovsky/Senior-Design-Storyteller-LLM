The '''city walls''' of [[Qudra]] in [[north Zakhara]] were a prominent fortification and a marvel of engineering.

==Description==
The city walls were made from [[granite]] quarried from the [[Furrowed Mountains]]. They measured {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall and a staggering {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} thick. The outer {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of the wall was solid stone, and a {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} wide tunnel behind that allowed for the movement of the [[mamluk]]s. A trio of fortified gates, all facing the mountains, breached the wall. The wall curved to surround the harbor along the coast of the [[Great Sea]] and was dominated by {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} towers at each end that monitored the waters. A great chain could be hoisted between the two towers to block the harbor from any naval attacks.

==Defenses==
Mamluks of the various mamluk organizations took turns patrolling the walls on a monthly basis. Large cauldrons of ''[[everburning oil]]'' were positioned at strategic points along the wall, ready to be dumped onto any unfortunate invaders at a moment's notice.

==History==
As of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}}, the walls had never been breached.
