        "mainbody": "The House of Steel was the oldest Garagathan temple and later an abandoned underground temple of Garagos in Westgate during the late 15th century DR. It became a subterranean temple and the cult of the Reaver even after 1018 DR.\nUntil his death in 927 DR, Reaver King Gostaraj led the House of Steel. His successor Altarl Campion as King implemented the Templeban Edict that forced the House of Steel alongside all other religious temples underground or moved outside Westgate. The sewers and underground passages of Westgate were rife with old altars and symbols of Garagos. This last bastion of the Reavers faith was connected in Westgates catacombs during the Templeban Edict era.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR Garagos rampaged throughout Westgate and indirectly affected the underground temples popularity in the city.\nIn 1368 DR, the House of Steel was headed by a priestess of Garagos, Favored High Reaver Chaless the Cruel. By then, the cult membership had dwindled to under ten.\nThe more than a century abandoned structure lay directly beneath Darkdance Manor and as of 1480 DR was the lair of the vampire Kirenkirsalai. The monk acquiescence of Kalen Dren named Hessar knew how to safely navigate and enter the underground temple because of the vampire. As food for the new vampire Vaelis, Hessar died here.\nThere were a total of six priests in the temple by 1368 DR. The size declined since the heyday under the reign of Gostaraj the Reaver King.\nDuring its occupation by the faithful of Garagos, the House of Steel was well-guarded by many animated swords against the unbelievers. Noted on Eleasis 3  by monk Hessar, the temple rusted defenses used the sewers and passage walls to ambush, but could be bypassed by a certain passphrase.\nThe temple lay directly beneath the intersection of East Market Street and Silverpiece Way near the center of the city, almost underneath Darkdance Manor."
