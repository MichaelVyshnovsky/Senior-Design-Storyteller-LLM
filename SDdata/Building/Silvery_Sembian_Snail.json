        "mainbody": "The '''Silvery Sembian Snail''' was a [[tavern]] and [[festhall]] located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. Its proprietor was Housemaster [[Roond Asmyrk]].",
        "History": "The Silvery Sembian Snail was named after the [[Silvery She-Snail]], who was actually a famous nightclub [[dancer]] from Sembia.\n\nThe tavern was in business by [[1358 DR]]. It was still in business ''circa'' [[1369 DR]], and quickly growing famous.\n\nAfter several drunken parties spread from the Snail and into the town and disturbed livestock, Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]] reprimanded Roond Asmyrk, who began to use sobering spells on patrons and developed more indoor entertainments.\n\nFamed traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] wrote about the business in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]''.",
        "Location": "The tavern lay at the main crossroads with the [[Way of the Manticore]] on the eastern bank of Wheloon.",
        "Description": "The Snail was a place of comfort, luxury and fun, with merry parties that could grow noisy.",
        "Services": "The tavern had an impressive [[wine]] cellar that outdid those of many nobles and merchants of Cormyr, Sembia, and [[Waterdeep]]. However, the Housemaster, Roond Asmyrk, also used magic to alter the taste and smell of lesser wines to create \"shadow wines\" that resembled far more expensive vintages. A connoisseur could purchase both and compare them if they wished.\n\nIt was also almost a [[festhall]], with the main attraction considered to be the beautiful and charming wait-staff who also worked as escorts. They served the wines, helped the patrons drink them, and also made much of the wine themselves. Several of the women learned the teachings of [[Sune]], goddess of love and beauty, from Asmyrk, a retired cleric.\n\nThere were a few special indoor installations for entertainment. There were swing [[rope]]s from the gallery, heated and scented bathtubs to soak in, and a room filled haystacks and lit by spells that mimicked moonlight.\n\nTo prevent inebriated patrons and escorts causing trouble outside, Asmyrk cast [[spell]]s upon them to induce some sobriety.\n\nDespite the name, the inn had no [[Sembia]]n ownership.",
