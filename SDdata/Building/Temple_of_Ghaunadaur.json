        "mainbody": "The Temple of Ghaunadaur was a temple in the Sword Coast North dedicated to the worship of Ghaunadaur.\nThe temple was located on the north-eastern side of the Sword Mountains, near Wyvern Tor.\nThe Temple was described as foul, with walls and floors that seemed to take on qualities of ooze, and prayers to Ghaunadaur lining the walls.\nSometime around 1490 DR, the Champion of the Burning Dawn traveled to the temple to recover the Sigil of Ghaunadaur for the drow Morlesh, where, after fighting though the many oozes of the dungeon as well as encountering a number of cultists of Ghaunadaur, they confronted Morlesh in the temples innermost chambers, as he explained his wish to rebuild the cult with himself as leader and intending to use mind control to offer his deity willing human sacrifices."
