The Body Shop was a store belonging to the Datharathi chaka in Vaelan, Durpar. They grafted customers with plangent crystal prosthetics, turning them into plangents.
The Body Shop was visible from far away even in the bustle of Vaelan, thanks to the statue atop it.
Atop the building a smoothly flowing, slender humanoid statue made of both gray stone and rose quartz reached for the sky. The statue was about  tall.
The lobby was longer than it was wide, made of flowing lines, with six displays three on each lateral wall, advertising plangent configurations for sale there was nothing else visible save for a white door.
For those with the money, any plangent configuration could be provided.
Warian Datharathi, who left the city after , learned in  that plangents had become common in Vaelan during his absence. It was popular knowledge that one could become a plangent at the Body Shop, suggesting that th Body Shop had been founded sometime after 1367 DR.
Per Eined Datharathi, those who took the crystal into their own bodies were no longer themselves.
