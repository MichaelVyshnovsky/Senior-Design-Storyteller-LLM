The '''Baldur's Mouth''' was a [[print]] shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] that disseminated news via [[broadsheet]]s and town criers. It was housed in a narrow, five-story building.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Day of the Devil|15}}

{{quote|''Baldur's Mouth is truly remarkable. I had thought the purpose of a broadsheet was to inform the people, but. I see now that I was mistaken. Ink and paper are not as insidious as the voice of the Absolute, but they send out their commands all the same.''|[[Minthara Baenre]]}}

The ''Baldur's Mouth'' broadsheet was printed irregularly three to eight times during a [[tenday]], depending on how many articles and advertisers it can come up with for an edition.<ref> It was created by [[Ettvard Needle]], the son of a wealthy Lower City tailor.
