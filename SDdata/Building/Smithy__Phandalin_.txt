The '''Smithy''' was the local blacksmith of [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Smithy was located on the north side of town along the road that connected the town square to the [[Triboar Trail]].

==Interior==
Customers entered the Smithy to an open area containing the forge and a number of [[anvil]]s. The rest of the building was walled off and private.

==History==
Prior to [[1495 DR]], blacksmithing services were provided by master smith [[Alger Frakk]] and his apprentice [[Maza Fieldsalder]]. However, beginning that year, Maza took over as the sole smith in the establishment after Alger's untimely death.{{AI-time}} 

In [[1496 DR]], rumors circulated in Phandalin suggesting that Alger's death was suspicious, and some believed that Maza had good reasons to have killed him. Others dismissed these as slanderous lies spread by someone who wanted to take Maza's job.
