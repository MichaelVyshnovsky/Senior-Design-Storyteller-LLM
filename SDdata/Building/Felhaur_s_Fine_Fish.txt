'''Felhaur's Fine Fish''' was a [[fish]] store in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-09-21 - Felhaur's Fine Fish}}

==Location==
This store stood along [[Spices Street]], a few doors down from [[Khostal Hannass, Fine Nuts]].

==Services==
Felhaur's sold a wide variety of seafood. In addition to the scaled and finned "ordinary" varieties of fish, such as [[silverfin]]s, one could purchase [[eel]]s, [[octopuses]], [[sea cucumber]]s, [[shellfish]], [[squid]]s, and [[whelk]]s. These seafood were all kept within shallow metal displays, atop counters that gently sloped towards the customers. Within these shallow displays they sat atop in water a layer of crushed ice, with smooth flat stones atop them that kept air from getting in.

==Inhabitants==
This store was run by the third-generation fishmonger [[Felhaur]] and his six children. Felhaur's wife stayed uninvolved in the business, but handled the [[pickle|pickling]] and jarring of [[seaweed]] and whelks.

==Reputation==
Felhaur's was widely known and trusted all across the Dock Ward.

==Rumors & Legends==
There were persistent rumors that the proprietor of this establishment was involved in smuggling, leading the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to actively monitor the place. While Felhaur's was frequently used by smugglers as a spot for dropping messages, it was not involved in smuggling beyond that. Due to the the attention the Watch had over his establishment, Felhaur would kick out anyone that mentioned smuggling in his store.
