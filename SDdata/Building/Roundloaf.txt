'''The Roundloaf''' was the second major bakery in the town of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] as of [[1377 DR]].

==Location==
The bakery was built to the south along the [[Temple Approach Way]] that ran past the local [[Temple of Chauntea (Eveningstar)|Temple of Chauntea]], built atop a drained swamp, and continued towards the [[Dalelands]].

==Services==
Despite being established in the city that had another famous bakery, [[Eveningstar Bakery]], the Roundloaf did not compete with [[Urda Malo‎‎]]'s shop. Unlike the Eveningstar Bakery, the Roundloaf sold [[bread]] in bulk to traveling merchants, and the only type of bread [[Anthan Lokalarr]] made was a hard-crust roundloaf, coated in [[cinammon]]-[[oil]]-treated [[wax]] that served as a type of preservative, allowing the bread to travel great distances.

==History==
The Roundloaf was built by Anthan Lokalarr in the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, after he left [[Selgaunt]] and relocated to Cormyr.
