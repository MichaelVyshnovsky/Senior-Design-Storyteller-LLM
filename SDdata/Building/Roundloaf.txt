The Roundloaf was the second major bakery in the town of Eveningstar in Cormyr as of 1377 DR.
The bakery was built to the south along the Temple Approach Way that ran past the local Temple of Chauntea, built atop a drained swamp, and continued towards the Dalelands.
Despite being established in the city that had another famous bakery, Eveningstar Bakery, the Roundloaf did not compete with Urda Malo‎‎s shop. Unlike the Eveningstar Bakery, the Roundloaf sold bread in bulk to traveling merchants, and the only type of bread Anthan Lokalarr made was a hard-crust roundloaf, coated in cinammon-oil-treated wax that served as a type of preservative, allowing the bread to travel great distances.
The Roundloaf was built by Anthan Lokalarr in the , after he left Selgaunt and relocated to Cormyr.
