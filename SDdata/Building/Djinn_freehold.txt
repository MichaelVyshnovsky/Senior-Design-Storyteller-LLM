Djinn freeholds were the homes of noble djinni who did not reside in the Citadel of Ice and Steel.
Freeholds were made from large chunks of earth or stone that floated around in the Elemental Plane of Air.
Djinn freeholds could be located on the Elemental Plane of Air or on the Prime Material Plane.
Each noble djinn in charge of a freehold typically had several other households of djinn beneath them.
A regular household contained 15 djinn, several jann servants, and a collection of other elemental servants. 
Noble djinn on the Prime Material plane only had one household.
