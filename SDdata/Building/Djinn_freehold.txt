'''Djinn freeholds''' were the homes of [[noble djinni]] who did not reside in the [[Citadel of Ice and Steel]].

==Description==
Freeholds were made from large chunks of earth or stone that floated around in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].

==Location==
Djinn freeholds could be located on the Elemental Plane of Air or on the [[Prime Material Plane]].

==Inhabitants==
Each noble djinn in charge of a freehold typically had several other households of djinn beneath them.

A regular household contained 15 djinn, several [[jann]] servants, and a collection of other elemental servants. 

Noble djinn on the Prime Material plane only had one household.
