        "mainbody": "lying Fish Bridge was a bridge in the city of Loudwater that crossed the River Delimbiyr.\nThe bridge was a spectacular and beautiful arching stone structure. It was decorated with fanciful carved stone heads, with snarling, pig-snouted faces said to be those of dragon turtles.\nThe great dwarf craftsman Iirikos Stoneshoulder and his team of dwarves from Ammarindar built the ornate bridge across the Delimbiyr River at this site for some elven friends in the Year of the Dwarf, 149 DR. It was considered to be constructed by the dwarves to honor the elves. Thanks to the bridge, the growing settlement of Loudwater spread out on both sides of the Delimbiyr.\nAncient wards laid on the bridge to maintain it had, by the late 1480s DR, the quirk of causing fish (particularly the river trout known as szorp) swimming beneath it to fly over it instead, hence its name. On occasion, folk passing over the bridge were hit by these fish, which might cause a lot of embarrassment, but no real injury. If the fish landed on the bridge, it was a local custom to pick it up and throw it back in the river. This was thought to be good luck, if not just the right thing to do.While most likely the same bridge, the name and this detail were added in Storm Kings Thunder and thus were not mentioned in the earlier, albeit limited, descriptions of the unnamed bridge. The flying fish may therefore be result of the wards being disrupted in a later event such as the Spellplague."
