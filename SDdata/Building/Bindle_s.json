        "mainbody": "'''Bindle's''' was a club and private drinking establishment for wealthy merchants of [[Suzail]], popular in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and still in business as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Description": "Bindle's stood on the northwestern edge where the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] met with [[Stonebow Street]]. [[Fallas' Treasures of Thentia]], a notable [[silk]] merchant's store stood next-door to Bindle's.",
        "Services": "The club catered to the most stuck-up merchants of the city. It served berry and savory [[tart]]s and offered a cornucopia of the best drinks from the club's extensive cellars. Most members came to Bindle's to socialize and be seen while ensorcelled air in the club hall was filled with gentle singing and music. The same magic ensured conversations remained private and only heard by the intended parties. Bindle's waitresses were \"dressed\" in ''[[illusion]]'' magics of moving and dancing flames. The waitresses provided much-needed illumination to the darkened room, while the tables produced a dim radiance for those sitting down. The club had many more private wood-panel rooms for the guests.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, Bindle's was the favored meeting and negotiation spot for Suzail's mercantile inclined individuals. The merchants who frequented Bindle's began hiring actors to appear drunk, annoy, and drive away Suzail's young rowdy nobles that made business negations unpleasant. The club's owners did not mind such behavior as merchants carried more coin than the nobles.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, Bindle's remained a popular merchant spot; however, it lost all appeal in the eyes of Suzail's nobility.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|73}}"
