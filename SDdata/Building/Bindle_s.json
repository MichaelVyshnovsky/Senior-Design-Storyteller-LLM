        "mainbody": "Bindles was a club and private drinking establishment for wealthy merchants of Suzail, popular in the late 14 century DR and still in business as of the late 15 century DR.\nBindles stood on the northwestern edge where the Promenade met with Stonebow Street. Fallas Treasures of Thentia, a notable silk merchants store stood next-door to Bindles.\nThe club catered to the most stuck-up merchants of the city. It served berry and savory tarts and offered a cornucopia of the best drinks from the clubs extensive cellars. Most members came to Bindles to socialize and be seen while ensorcelled air in the club hall was filled with gentle singing and music. The same magic ensured conversations remained private and only heard by the intended parties. Bindles waitresses were \"dressed\" in illusion magics of moving and dancing flames. The waitresses provided much-needed illumination to the darkened room, while the tables produced a dim radiance for those sitting down. The club had many more private wood-panel rooms for the guests.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Bindles was the favored meeting and negotiation spot for Suzails mercantile inclined individuals. The merchants who frequented Bindles began hiring actors to appear drunk, annoy, and drive away Suzails young rowdy nobles that made business negations unpleasant. The clubs owners did not mind such behavior as merchants carried more coin than the nobles.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Bindles remained a popular merchant spot however, it lost all appeal in the eyes of Suzails nobility."
