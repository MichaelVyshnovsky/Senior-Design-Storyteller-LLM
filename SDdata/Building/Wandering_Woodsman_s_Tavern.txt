The Wandering Woodsmans Tavern was a quaint little inn and a tavern located in the town of Conyberry on the edge of the Neverwinter Wood.
The Wandering Woodsmans Tavern catered to local woodcutters and farmers who crowded the inns common room. The establishment sold the infamously terrible but strong Conyberry Stout.
In the late 14 century DR, the establishment was run by a middle-aged male human innkeeper who offered libations and cheap guest accommodations with an occasional performer stemming his instrument to entertain guests.
