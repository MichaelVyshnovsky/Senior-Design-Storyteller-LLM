The '''White Agate's Tower''' was located within the [[Court District]] of [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The mansion was situated around the base of the tower. The presence of wealth was evident on every visible surface of the mansion. Beautiful spires and shrubberies surrounded the two story structure. All prospective students were met and interviewed in the mansion's parlor. The basement contained two large poolsâ€”one of fresh water and one of sea water. Many aspiring [[Elemental mage|sea mages]] used these pools during their conjurations of [[water elemental]]s and even [[marid]]s. The rest of the basement contained the treasure of the [[White Agate]]. A wide variety of guardians protected the wealth stored here. The keys to the treasure rooms were kept behind a plain wall that was opened by a single command word that only the White Agate and his five most trusted students knew.

The tower portion of this complex rose {{SI|90|ft}} into the air and sat at the opposite end of a small courtyard where students often ate their meals. The tower housed the personal quarters of the White Agate, a library, the dormitory for his prized pupils, as well as his school for mages. 

The White Agate's quarters were on the top floor. They were watched by a [[guardian genie]]. Magical feathers from distant [[Maztica]] were used to circulate the air within his chambers.

==Activities==
Found on the [[Street of the Blithe Genie]], this mansion served as both the home and elite mage school of the famous White Agate.

==Inhabitants==
This tower and mansion was the home of one of the most powerful spellcasters in [[Zakhara]]. In addition, many guards and students could be found within.
