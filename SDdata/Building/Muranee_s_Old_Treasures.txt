century DR
Muranees Old Treasures was a used goods and clothing store in Hultail of Cormyr, ran by Muranee Crownlinden in the 15 century DR.
Muranees Old Treasures stood on the southern side of the main street in Hultail that stretched from the towns east to its west side.
The store was set up inside of a regular house that Muranee had converted into a shop. Almost the entire house was used to display the shops cornucopia of used goods, placed on tables on both the first and second floors. The kitchen, pantry, and back room where the women did their laundry and where the shops back entrance was were all closed to customers. After Muranees Old Treasures closed for the night, the women hoisted down their beds from the attic.
In the 15 century DR, Muranee ran the shop, helped by her six adopted wards. All younger women, Muranees daughters, aided her in the shops daily business, cooking, cleaning, and purchasing goods. Jeveldra Shieldwinter of Cormyr was the most competent of the store girls. They made a merry household.
