Dimswart Manor was a summer home of the Sage of Suzail, Dimswart, and his family. By 1357 DR, he was happily retired there living with his wife Leona and a large number of servants.
Dimswart Manor was located about half a days ride north of Suzail and two days away from Storm Horns.
The famous Sage of Suzails manor was, in reality, a large farm, barely big enough to be considered suitable for a summer home by a noble family from Waterdeep.
The main building had a roof tiled with red shingles. It had three chimneys and walls of solid stonework. The grounds of the manor were teeming with trimmed hedges and flowerbeds.
In 1357 DR, Alias of Westgate sought the sages help with the mysterious azure magical glyph tattoo that she woke up with one day. She arrived at the Dimswart Manor just a few days ahead of his daughter Gaylyns wedding to a member of the noble Wyvernspur family. Dimswart agreed to help the swordswoman in exchange for rescuing a bard named Olive Ruskettle who was hired to sing at the wedding but was captured by a fearsome red dragon on her way to the manor. Alias successfully returned the halfling bard and brought her just in time to save the wedding.
The wedding reception was eventually ruined by Alias herself. The azure glyphs forced her to attack the grooms cousin Giogi after confusing him with King Azoun.
Dimswart and his wife Leona resided in the manor surrounded by a small army of servants one of them was a maid named Leah. Dimswarts daughters lived with him in the past but in his older age, they all were eventually married off.
