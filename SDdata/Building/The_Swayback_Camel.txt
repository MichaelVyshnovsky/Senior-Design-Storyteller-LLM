The Swayback Camel was an inn in Bralizzar, a town on in the Dustwall Mountains.
The Swayback Camel was nestled the alleys west of the Bazaar. It had pockmarked walls.
The inns common room was kept somewhat dark, with only a few oil lamps for illumination, thus often requiring guests to navigate by feeling the people around them.
Muthi Pashtral was the owner.
The inn was noted for its smell of unwashed bodies and stale beer. Even those with the most iron-clad stomach would feel it turn at the mere contemplation of eating there.
Freelance camel drivers congregated at his inn, many of evil disposition.
