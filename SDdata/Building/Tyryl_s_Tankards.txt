Tyryls Tankards was a tavern that was established in Myth Drannor during the midâ€“7 century DR. Owned and run by the successful half-elven wizard Liusaidh Dyaena, it catered to the young, would-be spellcasters that hailed from the eclectic Dlabraddath district of the city.
It comprised a single-story structure built amongst the trees that overlooked the southern end of The Manysteps, in the southern end of the city.
The tavern catered to the students of the arcane arts that attended the nearby Tyryl Towers. As such it was warded from magic that exceeded minor illusions and cantrips, protecting its clientele from those young mages who may have had one too many to drink.
Tyryls Tankards was established during or just before the , replacing the older and seemingly less-refined "Bells Ringing" tavern.
