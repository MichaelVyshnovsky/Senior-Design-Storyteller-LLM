'''Moonstorm House''', known locally as '''Ladytowers''', was the castle-manse in [[Elversult]] that housed the city's Lady Lord and Lady Constable.

==Location==
It was situated at the base of a wooded hill on Moonstorm Lane, at the outskirts of Elversult, west of the city proper. The personal residences found nearby were referred to as "the Ladytowers' Lands".

==Structure==
Moonstorm House was a fortified castle of six wall-faces that surrounded an inner courtyard. Each bastion of the outer wall held a tower with a conical roof. Unlike other structures built of similar purpose, Moonstorm House had no central keep.

The central six-sided courtyard contained mirrored gardens and a grove of decorative trees.

==Defenses==
Moonstorm house boasted no defenses within its outer walls.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Yanseldara]], Lady Lord of Elversult during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
