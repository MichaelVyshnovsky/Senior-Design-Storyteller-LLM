Moonstorm House, known locally as Ladytowers, was the castle-manse in Elversult that housed the citys Lady Lord and Lady Constable.
It was situated at the base of a wooded hill on Moonstorm Lane, at the outskirts of Elversult, west of the city proper. The personal residences found nearby were referred to as "the Ladytowers Lands".
Moonstorm House was a fortified castle of six wall-faces that surrounded an inner courtyard. Each bastion of the outer wall held a tower with a conical roof. Unlike other structures built of similar purpose, Moonstorm House had no central keep.
The central six-sided courtyard contained mirrored gardens and a grove of decorative trees.
Moonstorm house boasted no defenses within its outer walls.
