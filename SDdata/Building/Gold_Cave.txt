The Gold Cave was the best place to acquire equipment in Elventree around 1367 DR. It was named because it was where most gold was exchanged in the town.
The Gold Cave was actually setup within a natural cave in Elventree.
The shop was run by a half-elf named Amaril Sweetwater. Though limited in what she carried, Amaril kept her store well-stocked for the basic gear adventurers required.
