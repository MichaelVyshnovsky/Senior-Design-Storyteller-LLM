The Statue of Kisonraathiisar was a monument dedicated to the topaz dragon and the first king of Westgate, Kisonraathiisar.
The Statue of Kisonraathiisar stood on the Harbor Loop of Westgate, on the streets western side, in the Loops inner block. In the late 14 century DR, the statue could be found to the southwest of Okuzos Imports shop. The masterfully sculpted statue mistakingly depicted the wyrm as a red dragon, but, despite that, was impressive. Of course, it was not built to scale. Benches were placed on the sides of the dragon statue, two on each side.
