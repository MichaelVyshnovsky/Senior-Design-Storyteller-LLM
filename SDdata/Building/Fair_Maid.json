        "History": "The tavern was visited by [[Elminster]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century; there, he had [[Caladaster]] and [[Baerdagh]] over for a meal in exchange for information on [[Scorchstone Hall]].\n\nAnother few days later, [[Tabarast]], [[Beldrune]], and an [[Azuth|unnamed Harper]] turned up, also asking about Elminster; Caladaster Daermree joined them, and warned them about [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]], something that haunted the Dead Place. Baerdagh was also revealed to be the Lion of Elversult, an old hero, and was goaded into talking about his exploits.\n\nLater, while Tabarast, Beldrune, and Caladaster were telling their tale of meeting Azuth at [[Karsus' Keep]], the [[undead]] sorceress [[Sharindala]] entered the tavern. She asked for the dress robe that Tabarast had received from Azuth as a reward; as he refused, Caladaster gave his own clothes over to her, and she took him over to her home to discuss something."
