        "mainbody": "The '''Low Lantern''' was a converted three-mast ship, the '''''Low Lantern''''', used as a festhall, tavern, and gambling house in [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was often used as a place for covert meetings.\n\n{{Quote|''If you're thirsting for a beverage or looking to gamble, you've come to the right place, but watch your step. Things can get pretty messy here.''|[[Laraelra Thundreth|Laraelra]] welcoming new guests to the Lantern.}}",
        "Location": "[[File:Low lantern map.jpg|thumb|left|''The Low Lantern at its mooring around 1482 DR.'']]\nAround [[1366 DR]], the Low Lantern cruised around the harbor of Baldur's Gate at night, but by [[1482 DR]] it stayed at its mooring permanently.",
        "Structure": "The Low Lantern was once a well-kept seafaring vessel",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "While it was quiet during daytime hours, the Low Lantern was often rowdy and loud, but also quite fun during the night.\n\nThere was an unspoken rule among the regular patrons regarding outsiders: don't pull a weapon unless they draw first."
        },
        "Services": "[[File:Low lantern - PaF.webp|thumb|300px|The boards of the ship were soaked with rum.]]\nThe Low Lantern offered drinks, gambling, and rooms to rent. Courtesans also offered their services there.\n\nThe drinks served at the Low Lantern were said to be some of the most expensive on the [[Sword Coast]]. Drinks available around 1368 DR included [[Westgate Ruby]], [[Suzale|Suz-ale]], [[Old One Eye]], [[Dragon's Breath Beer]], [[Luiren's Best]], [[Shadowdark ale]], and [[Bitter Black]].\n\nFor a fee, special parties in the rigging and sail booms could be arranged. For some adventurous customers, wedding nights were celebrated whilst up in the rigging or suspended over the waves from [[rope]]s and sail booms.",
        "Staff": "Around [[1368 DR]], the Low Lantern was owned by [[Lobar]]. Around 1482 DR, it was owned by [[Laraelra Thundreth]].\n\nThe workers at the Low Lantern were known as the \"crew\" and they were made up of ex-pirates. As well as serving the patrons, the crew also quelled large brawls and prevented fires.",
        "Patrons": "[[File:Low Lantern's figurehead.png|thumb|''Low Lantern's figurehead.'']]\nThe patrons of the Low Lantern were largely thugs, rogues, pirates, and the poorer citizens of Baldur's Gate. \n\nCirca 1368 DR, some patrons of the Low Lantern included [[Yago]], [[Desreta]], and [[Vay-ya]]. As of 1492 DR, visitors of the Lantern included the thug [[Grimboot]], the sailor [[Hitoshi Jade]], and the dastardly nobleman [[Amrik Vanthampur]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some people believed that Laraelra Thundreth worked for [[the Guild]]. Despite their suspicions, the crew of the Low Lantern would adamantly deny these rumors."
