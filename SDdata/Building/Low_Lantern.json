        "mainbody": "The Low Lantern was a converted three-mast ship, the Low Lantern, used as a festhall, tavern, and gambling house in Baldurs Gate. It was often used as a place for covert meetings.\nthumb|left|The Low Lantern at its mooring around 1482 DR.\nAround 1366 DR, the Low Lantern cruised around the harbor of Baldurs Gate at night, but by 1482 DR it stayed at its mooring permanently.\nThe Low Lantern was once a well-kept seafaring vessel\nthumb|250px|right|Below deck of the Low Lantern.\nThere were at least three levels below the upper deck. The first two decks were filled with bars and gambling tables. The lowest deck was split into small rooms that were available to rent. These rooms were often used by courtesans. By 1482 DR, leaks were a regular occurrence in the ship.\nWhile it was quiet during daytime hours, the Low Lantern was often rowdy and loud, but also quite fun during the night.\nThere was an unspoken rule among the regular patrons regarding outsiders dont pull a weapon unless they draw first.\nthumb|300px|The boards of the ship were soaked with rum.\nThe Low Lantern offered drinks, gambling, and rooms to rent. Courtesans also offered their services there.\nThe drinks served at the Low Lantern were said to be some of the most expensive on the Sword Coast. Drinks available around 1368 DR included Westgate Ruby, Suz-ale, Old One Eye, Dragons Breath Beer, Luirens Best, Shadowdark ale, and Bitter Black.\nFor a fee, special parties in the rigging and sail booms could be arranged. For some adventurous customers, wedding nights were celebrated whilst up in the rigging or suspended over the waves from ropes and sail booms.\nAround 1368 DR, the Low Lantern was owned by Lobar. Around 1482 DR, it was owned by Laraelra Thundreth.\nThe workers at the Low Lantern were known as the \"crew\" and they were made up of ex-pirates. As well as serving the patrons, the crew also quelled large brawls and prevented fires.\nthumb|Low Lanterns figurehead.\nThe patrons of the Low Lantern were largely thugs, rogues, pirates, and the poorer citizens of Baldurs Gate. \nCirca 1368 DR, some patrons of the Low Lantern included Yago, Desreta, and Vay-ya. As of 1492 DR, visitors of the Lantern included the thug Grimboot, the sailor Hitoshi Jade, and the dastardly nobleman Amrik Vanthampur.\nSome people believed that Laraelra Thundreth worked for the Guild. Despite their suspicions, the crew of the Low Lantern would adamantly deny these rumors."
