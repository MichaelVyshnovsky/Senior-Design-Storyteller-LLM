The '''Swordmaiden''' was one of the colossal [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] and its remains could be found in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This statue resembled a female version of the [[Honorable Knight]] walking statue.

==Locations==
By [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the statue's head was a shop known as [[Thort's Findings]], located in a city square between [[Hassantyr's Street]], [[Tarsar's Street]], [[Whaelgond Way]], and [[Ussilbran Street]].

==History==
During theÂ [[Spellplague]], in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the walking statue appeared and rampaged through the city. When stopped, the residents of Waterdeep's North Ward dismantled it and used its pieces for construction.
