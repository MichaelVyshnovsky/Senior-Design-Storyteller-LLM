'''Cutter's Dip''' was a seedy tavern in the [[Stiltways]] of [[Yhaunn]].

==Location==
The tavern was located on the third level of the Stiltways near its eastern edge close to the docks, directly above a small courtyard with a well.

==Structure==
The tavern was accessed by the assortment of ramps and ladders typical to the Stiltways. The jakes used by the customers were in fact the sides of the nearby walls around it, adding to the general stench of the enclosed area. The building was lined with narrow windows that had the glass knocked from them, while the main door was once a window that was expanded into a rough portal.

==Atmosphere==
Cutter's Dip reeked of filth and [[pipeweed]] smoke, but was still packed with customers. Bardic music was performed there, but spectating random violence was a much more popular form of entertainment, Despite the rowdiness, there was an unspoken rule that forbid weapons being drawn in the Dip.

==History==
In [[1373 DR]], the [[Selûne|Selûnite]] [[priestess]] and [[werewolf]] [[Feena Archwood]] investigated Cutter's Dip, hoping to find clues about the [[Temple of Shar (Yhaunn)|temple of Shar]].

==Inhabitants==
The tavern was frequented by a diverse variety of unscrupulous or unsavory characters, including sailors, craftsmen, merchants, and thugs.
* The bandits [[Stag (bandit)|Stag]] and [[Drik]].
* The dissolute cultists [[Keph Thingoleir]], [[Jarull Cartcoster]], [[Starne]], [[Baret]], and [[Talisk]].
* The typical bargoers [[Kor (Yhaunn)|Kor]] and [[Noyle]].
* The partially-insane [[Lahumbra Sashtyn]].
