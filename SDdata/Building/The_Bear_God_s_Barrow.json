        "mainbody": "The Bear Gods Barrow was a cavern within a barrow mound in Rashemen, guarded by telthor and elementals, about one days travel on foot from the Mulsantir city gates. The bear god Okku kept a watch over the place. The Kalach-Cha was bound here when Safiya found him.\nAn ancient underground Imaskari workshop was connected to the underground. It may have been found by Safiyah and the Kalach-Cha. According to Safiya, the ruin was no doubt Imaskari in origin, and the hill was a city in ages past the area mustve been uncovered by accident by the earth tremors from stirring spirits when she broke out the Kalach-Cha. Helmed horrors kept watch over the workshop, accompanied by a few animated weapons. An incomplete Imaskari golem, which Safiya dated as from the late Quyun dynasty, lay amongst the ruins. Safiya knew how to animate it, though she did not have a way of getting it to stay animated beyond the barrow.\nBesides a smattering of scrolls, notable treasures in the workshop included a Mage protector, a Breastplate of Hidden Imaskar, and an Imaskari rod."
