        "mainbody": "he Raging Lion was a large inn and tavern on the east side of the Trade Way in the north of Scornubel.\nIt was well guarded and had secure stables. It was generally unclean throughout, and a dirty gilded lion stood outside. Sometimes the residents left a severed animal head in the lions open jaws as a joke, and sometimes the heads of intelligent creatures were left there as a sinister message or warning. Inside, the chamberpots were also gilded lion heads. The staff of the establishment were known for being slow and leisurely.\nThree adventuring bands once made their home at The Raging Lion, but when one of them returned with great wealth looted from a Netherese ruin, the other two slaughtered them. The treasure remained undiscovered by 1366 DR.\nThe food available included roasts, stews, and vegetables. Upon request, the chef would prepare a platter of fried stuffed snake in a poultry gravy with almonds, a personal favorite. Elturian pheasant tail soup was available but it was not unknown for rodents and other low-quality meat to be used instead. Wine and spiced wine was available to drink, but ale was not sold."
