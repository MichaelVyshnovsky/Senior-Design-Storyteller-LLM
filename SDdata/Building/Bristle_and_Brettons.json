        "mainbody": "Bristle and Brettons was a tailors shop located in the sleepy hamlet of Longsaddle of the Savage Frontier in the late 15 century DR.\nBristle and Brettons offered a wide variety of clothing, finery, and costumes for balls and masquerades. The shops interior consisted of rows of fanciful, colorful, glittering fabrics wrapped around cloth dummies and tailored suits on display. Decorative hats and headwear of various sizes were hung high on the shops walls.\nThe shop was open in the late 15 century DR and was owned by Bristle – a tawny-furred tabaxi woman, and Brettons – a stout pudgy balding human male. Over the years, Brettons became acquainted with a charismatic con man and a rogue named Forge Fitzwilliam, the relationship that brought the rogue and his accomplices, Kira and Edgin Darvis, to the tailors shop in search of finery to wear to a grand masquerade ball at the West Caraway Acres in Neverwinters countryside. The group was able to find costumes for the entire thieves crew, along with masques to wear as part of the outfits."
