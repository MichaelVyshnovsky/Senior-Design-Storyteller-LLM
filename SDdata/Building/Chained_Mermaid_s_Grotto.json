        "mainbody": "he Chained Mermaids Grotto was an inn and tavern found in Yhaunn in 1358 DR.\nThe Grotto was not the worst set of accommodations in Yhaunn, narrowly beating out Reldegars Roost and its company. It was an old repurposed warehouse that was damp in summer and freezing cold in winter, and managed to cost as much as a much finer inn."
