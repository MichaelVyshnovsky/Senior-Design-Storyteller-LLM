The '''Grey Chimera''' was a franchise of [[inn]]s located in the countries of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]] in the [[Old Empires]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The chain of inns was founded by an [[adventurer]] named [[Jehokim]] who used the horde of treasure he found to retire from the life of the adventurer and found his first inn. By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, there was a Grey Chimera located in every major city throughout Unther and Mulhorand. Jehokim rented out these locations to others who each paid him a share of the profits.
