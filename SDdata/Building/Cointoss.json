As of the , it was run by the former adventurer Tanataskar Moonwind.\nIt was located near the citys marketplace, known as the Fishyard.\nThe tavern was the locale of choice for Yartarrans. It was known for its quiet atmosphere and its cloistered clientele, who were adverse to rowdy or scheming activities.\nIt was poorly lit and unremarkable, just as Yartarrans preferred.\nThe Cointoss earned its name from a standing wager set up by its proprietor. Any patron that could toss a coin through the eye slit of a helm, earned a free drink.\nThe taverns owner, Tanataskar Moonwind was once an cocky adventurer and a devout follower of Tempus. On one occasion, his pride got the better of him and Tempus took offense. The deity cursed Tanataskar to fly into an uncontrollable rage whenever he shed the blood of another.\nNot wanting to hurt any companions or innocents, the devout warrior retired to run the Cointoss in Yartar. He was always eager to hear stories and adventures from his fellow Yartarrans."
