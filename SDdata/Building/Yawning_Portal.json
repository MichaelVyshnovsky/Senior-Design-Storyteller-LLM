        "mainbody": "Later that year, on Halasters Higharvestide, assorted monsters began climbing and flying out of the well, so Durnan enlisted adventurers to aid him in holding them back, and to slay those that got out. Four giant spiders and a manticore were slain and dumped on the midden outside by highsun. Seven harpies flew out in late afternoon, and two made it out of the inn, but they were defeated by the City Guardsmen on griffons. Just as the defenders were about to be overwhelmed, however, a City Watch patrol—all undead, transformed into curst during the Time of Troubles and guarding Waterdeep from below—arrived to secure the bottom of the shaft.\nIn the early 1370s DR, a group of adventurers, whod delivered a rod of resurrection to the Waterdhavian Embassy of Ravens Bluff to restore the murdered ambassador Chalnath Tressoon, stayed at the Yawning Portal before they went to attend the ceremony at the temple of Tymora. They discovered the embassy attacked and the rod stolen. When they returned to the Yawning Portal that evening, they discovered a corpse stuffed in the closet of one of their rooms and the City Watch and Magister Raymond arriving to arrest them—theyd been framed! Eventually, they convinced Raymond they were likely innocent and he left them with a warning. Later, they pursued the culprit, known as Whisper, over the rooftops of Waterdeep, until he dived through the Yawning Portals skylight and into Undermountain. Durnan was annoyed he broke the glass and didnt pay his entrance fee, so he allowed the adventurers free passage, asking them to bring back Whispers head and coin to pay for the skylight. They ended their escapade in the Yawning Portal talking to the ambassadors aid Richard Renqueth and Waterdhavian noble Danilo Thann.\nWhen drow assassins emerging from Undermountain attacked certain Waterdhavians in the month of Kythorn in the , Durnan organized adventurers to go down to investigate. Gathered in the inn at the time were the aged paladin Tanarell, the monk Cyphus Ordinae, the druid Parley, the gnome Glim Folkor, and the Sunite cleric White Thesta, as well as some noted heroes from Neverwinter Daelan Red Tiger, Linu Laneral, Sharwyn, and Tomi Undergallows. Also present was the hero who had been Drogan Drogansons pupil (granted a free room and complimentary dagger by Durnan and awoken by a drow thief in the room) and the kobold bard Deekin Scalesinger, both from Hilltop. However, a band of drow, duergar, and a beholder emerged from the well and attacked the assembled adventurers, who repelled them and the Neverwintans hastily chased them back into Undermountain, followed by the hero of Hilltop.\nAt dawn on Eleint 30 in the , Waterdeep was rocked by both an earthquake and visions sent by the Mad Mage Halaster. Halasters Call drew adventurers and mages of all kinds to Undermountain The Called, as they were known, soon filled the Yawning Portal Inn and were eager to enter the depths of Undermountain. There were also more thieves, spies, and confidence tricksters preying upon them, with Shadow Thieves, Unseen, Twisted Rune, Halasters Heirs, and Agents of the Eye all being interested in the treasure seen in Halasters Call.\nSome time around the turn of the 1400s DR,This is undated, but is \"nearly a century\" prior to the framing story Tales from the Yawning Portal, which is itself undated but occurs sometime between 1479 and 1492 DR. Durnan ventured back into Undermountain, his cause unknown. Although all expected him to return victorious in a matter of days, he was not seen or heard from again. As the months and years passed, he was widely believed to have finally met his doom in the dungeon that had made his name and fortune.\nAn explorer, Miriam Sequora, returned to the Yawning Portal having visited the ruins of Skullport in the 1470s DR, and spoke of veins of mithral and Netherese artifacts, and produced the nuggets and items to prove it. This prompted renewed interest in the Port of Shadow.\nIn the winter of the , a half-elf named Fayne sought to hire adventurers to explore a newly discovered area of Undermountain. Unfortunately, her first choices led her to the alley outside to mug her fortunately, the adventurers who came to her rescue did take the job.\nAlso that year, Lady Lestra Urmbrusk tried to recruit a party going into Undermountain to search for her nephew Rutherford Urmbrusk, whod gone missing there four weeks previously. Unfortunately, his companion Zarr had gone mad, gained control of an army of goblins and kobolds, and begun ambushing adventurers in and around the Entry Well. The loss of life and business alarmed Durnan the Sixth and he would waive the fees for those whod hurry down to investigate the next attack.\nOne night in late Tarsakh, Araezra Hondyl and Talanna Taenfeather of the City Guard pursued Shadowbane from the Downshadow area of Undermountain and the three of them climbed up the dry well. Tal and Shadowbane briefly fought in the Yawning Portal before the chased moved out into the streets.\nAfter being missing and thought deceased for almost a hundred years, a man purporting to be the original Durnan was hoisted up from the well one night in the usual manner. While most folk were understandably skeptical, those whod been alive back then recognized him and vouched for him. In any case, hed come back with enough wealth for them to retire on. Then this Durnan went to his usual spot behind the bar, toasted his safe return, and took up where hed left off a century past.The framing story of Tales from the Yawning Portal is undated but is necessarily set between 1479 DR (when Durnan the Sixth manages the inn) and 1492 DR (when the apparently original Durnan manages the inn again in Dragon Heist and Dungeon of the Mad Mage). This page assumes 1480s DR for convenience.\nSome time in the early 1490s DR, Artor Morlin, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and also a vampire, enlisted the aid of adventurers to evict a band of rival vampires known as the Undertakers from their lair in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. He arranged with Durnan to help them find it. He later met adventurers in person at the Yawning Portal to send them against the Sharran vampires at Vankrakdoom.\nAt one point, Durnan abruptly called time on orders and closed the Yawning Portal, and ventured back into Undermountain, again for unknown purpose. Mirt enlisted adventurers to find him. In fact, Durnan had been compelled by the ancient black dragon Skallindrax, an old enemy whod been trapped inside a bottle of Maztican mescal, which Durnan had drunk.\nThe reclusive author Captain Tenebrux Morrow lived out of rooms in the Yawning Portal, coming out only for food and writing supplies and to deliver manuscripts of The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow.\nAt one point, the members of the Bureau of Dark Tables adventuring party—Deelia, Sasha, Brian, and Squirladax—visited the Yawning Portal to participate in that years \"Great Delving\", an event in which group after group was lowered into Undermountain to \"battle evil\" amidst much revelry. Among other things, they ordered the \"Heroes Feast\", the would-be heroes feasted, and, when they received the bill, found it more expensive than ever expected. Deelia burned the bill, Brian broke the winch, and the group fled into the streets without paying, pursued by Durnan and the City Watch. Whilst hiding, they would even make an unplanned escape from Waterdeep aboard a spelljammer.\nthumb|left|350px|Volo welcomes people to his table at the Yawning Portal.\nIn the , revelry in the inn was disrupted first by a brawl between Yagra Stonefist of the Zhentarim and Krentz and his Xanathar Thieves Guild gang, and then by a troll and several stirges climbing out of the well Durnan settled both matters, with or without the aid of adventurers. In the aftermath, noted author Volothamp Geddarm met with a band of adventurers and hired them to help find his friend Floon Blagmaar. He met them there again when they returned with Floon, and rewarded them with the deed to Trollskull Manor.\nThat same year, the Yawning Portal was frequented by various folk with tasks to be done in the dungeons. Obaya Uday, a cleric of Waukeen who paid handsome for magic items and spellbooks recovered from Undermountain. Mattrim Mereg needed a delivery to Calal Claddani in Skullport. Esvele Rosznar asked adventurers to keep an eye out for her brother Kressando. Joroth Brighthelm asked successful adventurers to look out for the dwarven delvers and suspected thieves known as Falkirs Fist, who went missing in Undermountain the previous year. Even Volo shared the legend of the lost throne of Coronal Syglaeth Audark, last ruler of Illefarn, thought to lie in Undermountain if rediscovered, he would tell elven friends about it. Around this time, Halaster Blackcloak was scrying on the Yawning Portals taproom and well entrance, amongst other Waterdhavian landmarks, via a false portrait kept in the Halasters Tower demiplane accessed from Undermountain.\nthumb|right|A playbill for Rusty Bighats show.\nAt one point, a traveling theater troupe led by master of ceremonies Rusty Bighat performed in the Yawning Portal, though others could request to be part of the lineup. However, one of the early shows was interrupted in spectacular fashion by a runaway double-decker dray carriage crashing through one of the walls, to cover for the theft of a certain item from some adventurers. The City Watch investigated and removed the carriage, and the Carpenters, Roofers, & Plasterers Guild repaired the damage, and the Yawing Portal reopened to some semblance of normal operation within an hour, after which the show went on. However, this would not be the end of chaos in the Yawning Portal.\nOne story about the Yawning Portal went that an adventurer who couldnt afford the fare to ride back up the well was nearly killed whilst finding another way of Undermountain, and laid a curse—on the payment bucket.\nCirca 1492 DR, a band of doppelgangers were rumored to operate out of the Yawning Portal. The Harpers and Emerald Enclave even sought people to investigate this.\nIn local lore, one night, Mirt the Moneylender climbed the roof and sat atop the peak by the weathervane, where he sang bawdy songs. He was, presumably, quite drunk."
