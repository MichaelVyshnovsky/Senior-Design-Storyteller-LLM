Seven [[harpies]] flew out in late afternoon, and two made it out of the inn, but they were defeated by the City Guardsmen on [[griffon]]s. Just as the defenders were about to be overwhelmed, however, a [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] patrol—all undead, transformed into [[curst]] during the Time of Troubles and guarding Waterdeep from below—arrived to secure the bottom of the shaft.<ref>\n\n===1370s DR===\nIn the early 1370s DR, a group of adventurers, who'd delivered a ''[[rod of resurrection]]'' to the Waterdhavian [[Embassy of Ravens Bluff (Waterdeep)|Embassy of Ravens Bluff]] to restore the murdered ambassador [[Chalnath Tressoon]], stayed at the Yawning Portal before they went to attend the ceremony at the temple of Tymora. They discovered the embassy attacked and the rod stolen. When they returned to the Yawning Portal that evening, they discovered a corpse stuffed in the closet of one of their rooms and the City Watch and [[Raymond (magister)|Magister Raymond]] arriving to arrest them—they'd been framed! Eventually, they convinced Raymond they were likely innocent and he left them with a warning.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|3-4,5-6,13-14}} Later, they pursued the culprit, known as [[Whisper (shadow dragon)|Whisper]], over the rooftops of Waterdeep, until he dived through the Yawning Portal's skylight and into Undermountain. Durnan was annoyed he broke the glass ''and'' didn't pay his entrance fee, so he allowed the adventurers free passage, asking them to bring back Whisper's head and coin to pay for the skylight.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|4,20}} They ended their escapade in the Yawning Portal talking to the ambassador's aid [[Richard Renqueth]] and Waterdhavian noble [[Danilo Thann]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|24-25}}\n\nWhen [[drow]] assassins emerging from Undermountain attacked certain Waterdhavians in the month of [[Kythorn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Durnan organized adventurers to go down to investigate. Gathered in the inn at the time were the aged [[paladin]] [[Tanarell]], the [[monk]] [[Cyphus Ordinae]], the [[druid]] [[Parley]], the [[gnome]] [[Glim Folkor]], and the [[Sunite]] cleric [[White Thesta]], as well as some noted heroes from [[Neverwinter]]: [[Daelan Red Tiger]], [[Linu La'neral]], [[Sharwyn]], and [[Tomi Undergallows]]. Also present was the hero who had been [[Drogan Droganson's pupil]] (granted a free room and [[Yawning Portal dagger|complimentary dagger]] by Durnan and awoken by a drow thief in the room) and the kobold [[bard]] [[Deekin Scalesinger]], both from [[Hilltop]]. However, a band of drow, [[duergar]], and a [[beholder]] emerged from the well and attacked the assembled adventurers, who repelled them and the Neverwintans hastily chased them back into Undermountain, followed by the hero of Hilltop.\n\nAt dawn on [[Eleint 30]] in the {{yearlinkName|1375}}, Waterdeep was rocked by both an earthquake and visions sent by the Mad Mage Halaster. [[Halaster's Call]] drew adventurers and mages of all kinds to Undermountain<ref> The Called, as they were known, soon filled the Yawning Portal Inn and were eager to enter the depths of Undermountain. There were also more thieves, spies, and confidence tricksters preying upon them, with [[Shadow Thieves]], [[Unseen]], [[Twisted Rune]], [[Halaster's Heirs]], and [[Agents of the Eye]] all being interested in the treasure seen in Halaster's Call.\n\n===Undated===\nSome time around the turn of the 1400s DR,<ref group=\"note\">This is undated, but is \"nearly a century\" prior to the framing story ''Tales from the Yawning Portal'', which is itself undated but occurs sometime between 1479 and 1492 DR. Durnan ventured back into Undermountain, his cause unknown. Although all expected him to return victorious in a matter of days, he was not seen or heard from again. As the months and years passed, he was widely believed to have finally met his doom in the dungeon that had made his name and fortune.\n\n===1470s DR===\nAn explorer, [[Miriam Sequora]], returned to the Yawning Portal having visited the ruins of Skullport in the 1470s DR, and spoke of veins of [[mithral]] and [[Netherese]] artifacts, and produced the nuggets and items to prove it. This prompted renewed interest in the Port of Shadow.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport|2}}\n\n====1479 DR====\nIn the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a [[half-elf]] named [[Fayne]] sought to hire adventurers to explore a newly discovered area of Undermountain. Unfortunately, her first choices led her to the alley outside to mug her; fortunately, the adventurers who came to her rescue did take the job.\n\nAlso that year, Lady [[Lestra Urmbrusk]] tried to recruit a party going into Undermountain to search for her nephew [[Rutherford Urmbrusk]], who'd gone missing there four weeks previously. Unfortunately, his companion [[Zarr]] had gone mad, gained control of an army of [[goblin]]s and kobolds, and begun ambushing adventurers in and around the Entry Well. The loss of life and business alarmed Durnan the Sixth and he would waive the fees for those who'd hurry down to investigate the next attack.<ref>\n\nOne night in late [[Tarsakh]], [[Araezra Hondyl]] and [[Talanna Taenfeather]] of the City Guard pursued [[Kalen Dren|Shadowbane]] from the [[Downshadow]] area of Undermountain and the three of them climbed up the dry well. Tal and Shadowbane briefly fought in the Yawning Portal before the chased moved out into the streets.<ref>\n\n===1480s DR===\nAfter being missing and thought deceased for almost a hundred years, a man purporting to be the original Durnan was hoisted up from the well one night in the usual manner. While most folk were understandably skeptical, those who'd been alive back then recognized him and vouched for him. In any case, he'd come back with enough wealth for them to retire on. Then this Durnan went to his usual spot behind the bar, toasted his safe return, and took up where he'd left off a century past.The framing story of ''Tales from the Yawning Portal'' is undated but is necessarily set between 1479 DR (when Durnan the Sixth manages the inn) and 1492 DR (when the apparently original Durnan manages the inn again in ''Dragon Heist'' and ''Dungeon of the Mad Mage''). This page assumes 1480s DR for convenience.\n\n===1490s DR===\nSome time in the early 1490s DR, [[Artor Morlin]], a [[Masked Lord]] of Waterdeep and also a [[vampire]], enlisted the aid of adventurers to evict a band of rival vampires known as the [[Undertakers]] from their lair in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. He arranged with Durnan to help them find it.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Into the Dark|8,9,22}} He later met adventurers in person at the Yawning Portal to send them against the [[Sharran]] vampires at [[Vankrakdoom]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Forge of Fangs|5}}\n\nAt one point, Durnan abruptly called time on orders and closed the Yawning Portal, and ventured back into Undermountain, again for unknown purpose. Mirt enlisted adventurers to find him. In fact, Durnan had been compelled by the ancient [[black dragon]] [[Skallindrax]], an old enemy who'd been trapped inside a bottle of [[Maztica]]n [[mescal]], which Durnan had drunk.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Last Orders at the Yawning Portal|1,4,9,68}}\n\nThe reclusive author Captain [[Tenebrux Morrow]] lived out of rooms in the Yawning Portal, coming out only for food and writing supplies and to deliver manuscripts of ''[[The True and Impossible Adventures of Tenebrux Morrow]]''.\n\nAt one point, the members of the [[Bureau of Dark Tables]] adventuring party—[[Deelia]], [[Sasha (fighter)|Sasha]], [[Bri'an]], and [[Squirladax]]—visited the Yawning Portal to participate in that year's \"Great Delving\", an event in which group after group was lowered into Undermountain to \"battle evil\" amidst much revelry. Among other things, they ordered the \"Heroes' Feast\", the would-be heroes feasted, and, when they received the bill, found it more expensive than ever expected. Deelia burned the bill, Bri'an broke the winch, and the group fled into the streets without paying, pursued by Durnan and the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. Whilst hiding, they would even make an unplanned escape from Waterdeep aboard a [[spelljammer]].\n\n====1492 DR====\n[[File:Volobar.png|thumb|left|350px|''Volo welcomes people to his table at the Yawning Portal.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{WDH-time}} revelry in the inn was disrupted first by a brawl between [[Yagra Stonefist]] of the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Krentz]] and his [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]] gang, and then by a [[troll]] and several [[stirge]]s climbing out of the well; Durnan settled both matters, with or without the aid of adventurers. In the aftermath, noted author [[Volothamp Geddarm]] met with a band of adventurers and hired them to help find his friend [[Floon Blagmaar]].<ref> He met them there again when they returned with Floon, and rewarded them with the deed to [[Trollskull Manor]].<ref>\n\nThat same year, the Yawning Portal was frequented by various folk with tasks to be done in the dungeons. [[Obaya Uday]], a cleric of [[Waukeen]] who paid handsome for [[magic item]]s and [[spellbook]]s recovered from Undermountain. Mattrim Mereg needed a delivery to [[Cal'al Claddani]] in Skullport. [[Esvele Rosznar]] asked adventurers to keep an eye out for her brother [[Kressando Rosznar|Kressando]]. [[Joroth Brighthelm]] asked successful adventurers to look out for the dwarven delvers and suspected thieves known as [[Falkir's Fist]], who went missing in Undermountain the previous year. Even Volo shared the legend of the lost throne of [[Coronal]] [[Syglaeth Audark]], last ruler of [[Illefarn]], thought to lie in Undermountain; if rediscovered, he would tell elven friends about it. Around this time, [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was [[scrying]] on the Yawning Portal's taproom and well entrance, amongst other Waterdhavian landmarks, via a false portrait kept in the [[Halaster's Tower]] [[demiplane]] accessed from [[Undermountain]].<ref>\n\n[[File:Yawning Portal playbill.jpg|thumb|right|''A playbill for Rusty Bighat's show.'']]\nAt one point, a traveling theater troupe led by master of ceremonies [[Rusty Bighat]] performed in the Yawning Portal, though others could request to be part of the lineup.{{Cite adventurers league/Once in Waterdeep|5,9,25}} However, one of the early shows was interrupted in spectacular fashion by a runaway double-decker dray carriage crashing through one of the walls, to cover for the theft of a certain item from some adventurers. The City Watch investigated and removed the carriage, and the [[Carpenters', Roofers', & Plasterers' Guild]] repaired the damage, and the Yawing Portal reopened to some semblance of normal operation within an hour, after which the show went on. However, this would not be the end of chaos in the Yawning Portal.{{Cite adventurers league/Once in Waterdeep|7-8}}",

The inn's relative proximity to the city's docks helped it do good business.\n\nIts site was exactly that of the former [[Halaster's Hold]], the demolished tower of the mad mage [[Halaster Blackcloak]], the builder of Undermountain, and the inn was constructed over the well to Undermountain, which had previously been a place of execution, simply known as \"the Well\".",
        "Structure": "Due to fires and other adventurer-related disasters, the Yawning Portal had been rebuilt a number of times, with a fourth floor added in one reconstruction.The Yawning Portal has been variously stated in different sources to have two to four floors or stories, and it is unclear when this includes the ground floor or not. In a [https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1333606920813416452 tweet], Ed Greenwood gives a final figure of four stories, including the ground, with it being rebuilt several times and a fourth floor added at some point. This implies it only had a total of three stories initially, suiting the more common descriptions. It had a roof of [[slate]]. that were fed by the kitchen ovens, the common room hearth (and sub-hearths on upper floors), and several others that warmed other rooms and the stables. A weathervane and a few lightning rods topped the peak of the roof.<ref name=\"TheEdVerse2020\"  />\n\nTo mark the entrance to the inn, there was a signboard hanging above the front door that simply read \"The Yawning Portal\" in letters carved deep into wood weathered to a silvery color. It was suspended from a black-painted [[iron]] pole by two short loops of chains and this pole was set into the wall at the level of the first floor. This sign was quite old, having been recovered and reused each time the inn was rebuilt.<ref name=\"TheEdVerse2020\"  /> \n\nOriginally, the front door had a rounded shape and, for a time in 1358 DR, was scrawled with \"Come Ye Inn\" in [[chalk]].{{cite web\n| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1450665643880165380\n| title = Yawning Portal entrance\n| accessdate = 2024-03-11\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20211020033023/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1450665643880165380\n| archivedate = 2021-10-20\n| author = [[Ed Greenwood]]\n| date = 2021-10-19\n| format = Tweet\n| work = [https://twitter.com/theedverse theedverse]\n| publisher = Twitter\n}} On the north side, a double-width back door led to the kitchen; it could be opened wide enough to permit a cart or wagon to be rolled inside for deliveries of goods or furniture, but this was rarely necessary. The door was secured with bolts into the floor and upper frame and with a bar.<ref name=\"TheEdVerse2020\"  />\n\nThe inn was adjoined on the east by a stables, which neighbored Lankathla Dree's Bakery.<ref name=\"TheEdVerse2020\"  />",
        "Interior": {
            "Lobby": "In the late 1400s DR, entry was via a vestibule that served as a cloakroom or lobby. It held a reception desk staffed by a hostess on the north side and a rack for [[cloak]]s and [[coat]]s against the south wall, and had three [[housejack]]s (bouncers) on duty. East of the desk was the door into the common room proper.",
            "Common Room": "[[File:Yawning interior wow.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''An empty corner of the taproom by the fireplace.'']]\nTaking up much of the ground floor,\n\nFor illumination, there were simple [[chandelier]]s, known as candle-wheels; these wagon-wheels bearing many thick burning [[candle]]s were suspended by [[chain]]s from the ceiling. However, this lighting was dim and left shadowed corners. Hence, candles were stood on individual tables as well. Otherwise, Durnan was known to use  a ''[[driftglobe]]'' for illumination, though it followed him in his work, and a skylight had been installed by the early 1370s DR. Moreover, the air was smoky, fragrant with the pipesmoke and spiced wine, and the interior was somewhat dingy, with black beetles spotted scurrying across the knife-marked tables early in its life in the 1320s DR. Despite this, the main impression was of comfort, not of being dirty or unwelcoming.\n\n[[File:Yawning portal - PaF.webp|thumb|250px|''An emboldening mug of beer, mead, or cider is standard for adventurers before descending into Undermountain, and many more drinks are enjoyed if they return.'']]\nIn the late 1400s DR, the Yawning Portal had been remodeled, with second- and third-floor balconies overlooking the taproom. Wooden stairs led up from the ground floor to these{{Cite adventurers league/Once in Waterdeep|4}} and the guest rooms adjoined the balconies. These provided patrons with an overhead view of any action in the well while they remained at their tables. Typically, these balconies were occupied by merchants and noble more interested in spectating, while adventurers and others stayed on the ground to be closer to the action. By this time, the taproom was decorated with an astonishing selection of trophies and knickknacks recovered from Undermountain and left in the inn, whether as gifts to Durnan, in payment for a bar tab, or for having lost a bet to him. Bloodstained banners, unknown sigils, and strange statues were amongst the dozens of relics on display.\n\nThe bar, chairs, and tables were all sturdily made of heavy wood. Some of the tables were constructed around the pillars and could not be moved.\n\nIn the taproom was a trapdoor that opened onto a chute. Due to a magic ward placed on it, only Durnan could open it. ''Circa'' 1339 DR, he dropped inconvenient corpses down the chute, to be devoured by something deep below. However, the noise tended to disturb patrons during their own dining.\n\n[[Mop]]s were kept close to hand. These had been wielded in brawls as improvised staves, used as aids for reaching people go in and out of the well, and, presumably, even used in cleaning up spills.",
            "Other Rooms": "[[File:Yawning Portal meeting room - Avatar comic.png|thumb|right|250px|''Midnight, Kelemvor, Khelben, and Elminster in a meeting room in the Yawning Portal.'']]\nOn the ground floor, there were side-rooms with bare wooden tables that served as offices or for private meetings.Secret tunnels to the Yawning Portal appear in both ''Elfsong'' by Elaine Cunningham and [https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1333606938706391043 this tweet] from Ed Greenwood. Ed declares the latter is under a non-disclosure agreement, so lacking any contradictory information, this article assumes these to the same tunnel.\n\nFrom the common room, steep wooden staircases led to the second and third levels.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|7}} The rooms were comfortable and well appointed. Each floor had a fireplace at the east end of its central hall. During wintertime, rocks heated in these fireplaces were placed in each room to warm them; these rocks were loaded into barrel-ends with rope handles. There was also a sitting room for meeting in peace.\n\nThe inn had multiple cellars for storage of wine, ale, and foodstuffs; these were no larger in extent than the inn above. as well as an attic.<ref name=\"TheEdVerse2020\"  />",
            "Entries to Undermountain": "The inn had not one but two wells that could serve as entry points to Undermountain's uppermost level. It also had not one but two secret passages in its cellars. Rumors spoke of only one of these secret passages being hidden behind a wall in the cellar, though this was not quite accurate.\n\nIn addition, a certain [[marble]] column in the [[Wyllowwood]] area of Undermountain could teleport a party back to a booth in the Yawning Portal, but also to random places throughout the dungeon and indeed the whole world, so this was not exactly useful as a means of return.<ref>",
            "Atmosphere": "[[File:Yawning Portal patrons Dr227.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Patrons of the Yawning Portal, talking and laughing and careless of the danger below.'']]\nThe clientele consisted mostly of [[adventurer]]s, as well as Waterdhavian merchants and laborers and travelers from far-flung parts, all of them mingling freely. The travelers came from up and down the [[Sword Coast]], from the far corners of [[Faerûn]] and from [[Kara-Tur]], and a few even from other worlds entirely.\n\nFirst-time visitors from outside Waterdeep were often surprised by the lack of concern that local patrons paid to the close proximity of the dungeon; this was due to the Waterdhavian's customary lack of fear about most things.<ref><ref> In fact, Waterdhavians were only too keen on sharing news, rumors, and stories about the dungeons of Undermountain, whether as warnings or as boasting, and at the Yawning Portal, such conversation was ceaseless.<ref> As a result, the Yawning Portal was a good place for acquiring dungeoneering knowledge,<ref> though it usually cost the price of drinks or a meal.<ref> Professional adventurers would also frequent the inn in order to pick up work and paid missions into Undermountain. Those with specific missions in Undermountains usually came when the inn was quiet.\n\n[[File:Brawl_at_the_Yawning_Portal-5e.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A brawl breaking out at the Yawning Portal nevertheless.'']]\nDespite the armed adventurers, the Yawning Portal suffered little in the way of brawling or other troublemaking. Durnan, despite his old age in the late 1300s DR, was still a brawny man who kept his old [[greatsword]] [[Grimvault]] behind the bar amongst the racks of bottles and mugs, and politely ''asked'' troublemakers to leave the inn before he tossed them out, sometimes by picking them up hurling them through the front door and watching how far they flew. He also kept a loaded crossbow behind the bar and could hurl either a metal tankard or handaxe with devastating accuracy. However, he avoided killing unless he had no other choice, favoring therefore his fists and tankards. Difficult drunks were often given drinks mixed with a potent sleeping powder. Moreover, off-duty members of the City Guard were often around and could alert others if fighting got out of hand, both inside and out. Dedicated toughs and brawlers were wise to stay away. At a result, the Yawning Portal remained a reasonably safe and enjoyable place in which to stay, pass time, and have a drink and a bite. Nevertheless, it was not unknown for a monster out of Undermountain to scale the well shaft and attack patrons during their evening meal."

First, he dispensed advice, often encouraging beginners to explore only ten rooms before returning to the Yawning Portal, so as not to try their luck nor the patience of Tymora.

He rented out storage lockers for 5 [[gp]] per day, paid up front, and claimed and sold the contents if not collected in time; this notwithstanding, these lockers were among the safest storage options in the city. He also maintained a supply of must-have equipment that he could sell to needy adventurers at standard prices, including mundane torches and flasks of water that would attach to one's [[belt]]. In addition, he sold healing potions, which he purchased from the temple of Tymora, in bulk at a discount rate.

In addition, traders in adventuring supplies, maps, weaponry, and armor looked for customers here. ''Circa'' 1479 DR, Durnan the Sixth allowed the gnome [[Maklin Mucklar]] to sell healing potions and alchemical mixtures in exchange for a cut of the profits.<ref>\n\nDurnan and the local [[church of Tymora]] had an arrangement. Durnan paid the church a daily retainer  of 20 gp and the church sent a [[cleric]] of theirs to serve as a healer each day. The priest's aid cost the injured party a donation—effectively a fee for it was demanded on the spot and not merely expected, and they did not lend their aid on credit.{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|15-17,19}} To those adventurers going in, the priests always offered to chant Tymora's blessings, but were not offended if this was declined. They would never set foot in Undermountain themselves. Around 1368 DR, [[Lamris Kholl]] served from dawn to dusk, while Brother [[Adama Miiralin]] served from dusk to dawn and maintained the records. Around 1375, these duties were fulfilled by Adama and [[Orbrin Baerent]].<ref> In addition, Mhaere Dryndilstann, herself a cleric of [[Lathander]], regularly provided additional healing. By 1479 DR, the Tymorans no longer provided this healing service. Instead, more grimly and unasked for, a priest of [[Jergal]] known as Brother [[Sepulcher (priest)|Sepulcher]] recorded details of adventurers going in and questioned them about their plans, faith, and next of kin, and gave recommendations for emergency burials, while a Sister [[Palonya]] catalogued tombs in Undermountain.<ref>",

Bets were made openly and could cover whether or not they returned; what condition they returned in; and how many did or did not make it back. The adventurers themselves were forbidden to get involved in the betting. In 1368 DR, most betting was handled by the [[gnome]] odds-taker [[Gnossos Valmar]], while around 1479 DR this role was filled by the halfling odds-maker known as [[Stannoc|Old Stannoc]]<ref> and ''circa'' 1492 DR the returned Durnan himself took the bets as he enjoyed betting on the explorers.\n\nThe inn was also a place to hear music in the early 1490s DR, with low-talent [[bard]]s like [[Mattrim Mereg|Mattrim \"Threestrings\" Mereg]] playing regularly Or one could simply listen to drunken adventurers belting out bawdy songs instead. For more involved performances, troupes would have to set up their own stage and facilities in a corner of the common room."

Typically, the inn had a staff of 14 people who lived at the inn: the owner Durnan and his family, two waitresses/kitchen maids, two cooks, four chambermaids (who did much of the cleaning), a stablemaster, and two hostlers, as it did around 1375 DR. When off-duty, Durnan and his family and the chambermaids slept in vacant guest rooms on the top floor, or else shifted to cots in the cellar when the inn was fully booked, while the cooks, stablemaster, and hostlers occupied the stable's straw-filled loft.\n\nFollowing Durnan's return to Undermountain and subsequent absence for almost a century, management of the inn passed to his descendants.\n\n[[File:Mhaere Dryndilstann 3e.jpg|thumb|250px|''And his wife Mhaere Dryndilstann, offering a potion at the bar.'']]\nOther known employees included:\n* [[Tharl]], a guard ''circa'' 1339 DR.\n* [[Luranla Dreer]], a junior waitress and kitchen maid ''circa'' 1339 DR and 1375 DR.\n* [[Marrauda Belaskurth]], a senior waitress and kitchen maid ''circa'' 1375 DR.\n* \"Bladed\" [[Jhaax Dolbruin]], an ex-adventurer turned bartender and occasional bouncer, who started work at the start of 1368 DR.

Just enough came back, alive and wealthy, to attract others, both adventurous and avaricious. The inn also allowed Durnan to control passage between the city and the dungeon complex, both limiting access to Undermountain and containing its monstrous denizens. From then on, Durnan would leave regular exploration to younger adventurers.\n\nAfter two decades, this became a fashionable sport for rich and poor alike (though the nobles preferred to find or construct their own private entrances). A priest, their name since forgotten, later questioned Jardis's spirit via ''[[speak with dead]]'' to learn his story. Thereafter, the [[Church of Savras]] would hire adventurers to rediscover both the temple and the ''Third Eye''. A disguised Lord [[Darien Thal]] witnessed this contemptuously, thinking exploring Undermountain was a sport best left to the wealthy rather than the poor. He sought to hire someone to recover a certain item from Undermountain, but all recommended the capable thief [[Artek Ar'talen|Artek \"the Knife\" Ar'talen]], now in prison. When he was exposed as a nobleman, he got into a fight with a woman and killed her before he departed.\n\nMirt was due to meet [[Yelver Toraunt]] and play a game of [[lancers and lions]] with Durnan at the Yawning Portal on the night of the [[Revel of Storms]] in the {{YearlinkName|1339}}.

Durnan disposed of the body down the chute and he and Mirt later investigated.\n\n''Circa'' [[1340 DR]], the Undermountain guide and cartographer [[Aekyl Dafyre]] led three nobles down the well and, thanks to one of Halaster's ''[[gate]]s'', into an ambush by two [[owlbear]]s. Only a maimed Aekyl and one noble escaped back to the Yawning Portal.
