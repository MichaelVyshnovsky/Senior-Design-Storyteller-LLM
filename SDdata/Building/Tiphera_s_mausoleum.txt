Tipheras mausoleum was a lavish tomb in the Raurinshield mountains where Tiphera tir-Yseldre had been interred.
The mausoleum stood at the site of Tipheras victory against the blue dragon Sturykkazynarr.
A three-day rite at the location could be used to awaken the final set of powers of the Wyrmbane Helm.
The mausoleum was built on the orders of King Andizen after the death of Tiphera. She was interred there with her helm, the Wyrmbane Helm, but it disappeared soon after.
The mausoleum had become infested by powerful undead by the year .
