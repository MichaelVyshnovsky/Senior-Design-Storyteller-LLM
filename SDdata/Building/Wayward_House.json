        "mainbody": "The Wayward House was a popular, yet down-to-earth inn found in the Northbank of Silverymoon. It was located on the northwest corner of the city block where Bowshot Ride met Ghostwalk.\nThe fine inn was well-suited for those who wished to maintain a low profile within the city.\nThe Wayward House had the distinction of being built upon the ruins of another establishment called the Inn of Wayward Sages, that burned down sometime between the years 1366 and 1372 DR. The newer establishment enjoyed a much better reputation than its predecessor."
