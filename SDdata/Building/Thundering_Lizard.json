The location marked aligns most closely with the tavern's description in the text of that adventure and in other sources, specifically the emphasis on its proximity to the Red Bazar. The alternative location was due north, inland from the [[dye works (Port Nyanzaru)|dye works]].]]\nThe inn was occupied a street corner in Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] near the [[Red Bazaar]] slope of [[Mount Sibasa]].{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|72}}",
