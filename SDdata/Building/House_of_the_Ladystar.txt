The '''House of the Ladystar''' was a temple to [[Mystra]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
Stairs led to the front door, and there was a balcony atop.

==Defenses==
The guards had pikes. One of the guards was named [[Lhaerom]]. The gates of the temple were made of [[bronze]]. The Tome-priest of the temple was [[Kadeln Parosper]].

==History==
There was a riot in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, during a bout of chaos of [[the Art]], in which the archmage of the [[Phoenix Tower]], [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]], tried to talk to Kadeln Parosper; they only managed to briefly converse through the riot. After the crowd attempted to kill Tenthar, he retaliated with a ''[[chain lightning]]'', which caused a number of deaths in the mob. Two of the dead rose afterwards, however, showing themselves to be [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]].
