The Guardians Post was a temple dedicated to Helm found along the Lake of Steam in the coastal city of Yhep.
The temple was led by a paladin of Helm named Imingo Deiros during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Much of the Guardians Posts time and resources were spent monitoring for any beholder activity near Yhep which plagued the city during its past.
