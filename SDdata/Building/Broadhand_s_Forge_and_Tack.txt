==Description==
The shop was owned by the blacksmith [[Broadhand]], and sold a large variety of items. It had a horseshoe-shaped sign, made of wood, right above the door.

The shop actually had a secret door at the back that led to several more rooms, which were used in worship to the Black Lord.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the future [[Heroes of Ascore]] came to the shop to inquire about the festival going on in [[Mielikki's Glade]]. The party convinced the owner, Broadhand, that they had been sent from [[Nesm√©]] on behalf of the [[Banite]] cause. They were led through a secret door to the back section of the shop, and came before a shrine to the Black Lord. The room was decorated with statues and images of Bane, and it was here that Broadhand told them of the [[Zhentarim]] plan to seize territory across the northern realms.
