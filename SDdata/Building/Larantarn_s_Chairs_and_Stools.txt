'''Larantarn's Chairs and Stools''' was the shop of the master carpenter and furniture-maker [[Ommagol Larantarn]] of [[Sundabar]], ''circa'' [[1365 DR]].

Specializing in, as his shop's name states, wooden chairs and stools, 

Ommagol's shop featured heavy tapestries that hung upon the walls, and scattered across the floor. As he would turn chair legs on the [[lathe]], Ommagol would fling them over his shoulder while drinking [[wine]] and singing.
