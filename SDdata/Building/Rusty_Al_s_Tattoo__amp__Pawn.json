The building was partially built on land, partially supported by wooden beams over the Bay of Mists next to a long dock, not far from the districts gates, and surrounded by a hive of businesses, warehouses, and homes.\nSome of the more popular tattoo designs included Rope & Anchor, Heart & Arrow, Eye & Tears, and Gnaked Gnome. Two people, one tattoo each, were going for a hundred gold total at a special discount rate after the war of Neverwinter and Luskan.\nRusty Als was an established business by the . He and his shop survived the strife of that year the plague of the Wailing Death that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between Luskan and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, Als pawn business was suffering from the greatly weakened economy, so much of the businesss coin came from tattooing. When a duo of adventuring sailors that included Nisar Zayid was seeking to depart for the Nelanther Isles in 1372 DR, Rusty Al offered a special deal on tattoo designs that mightve been appealing to both adventuring sailors."
