Aubreys Peculiarities Shoppe was a store in Leilon in the late 15 century DR. The proprietor was the ghost of Aubrey Silverspun, a member of the Swords of Leilon who had died during the Spellplague.
The shop was located on the north-west side of the town, overshadowed by the High Tower of Thalivar.
The three adventurers that formed the Swords of Leilon were featured on a painted triptych above the counter a dark-skinned warrior lady named Augusta Krul, a red-bearded dwarf named Ogri Ninebeards, and the shops owner, Aubrey Silverspun, whose face had faded over time.
The shop sold trinkets and magic items and only appeared for certain individuals.
When Leilon was destroyed and Aubrey was killed during the Spellplague after 1385 DR, he became bound to Leilons ruins as a ghost. By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild the town. Aubrey kept a close eye on the towns reconstruction to prevent another calamity. In Aubreys Peculiarities Shoppe, he sold magic items to new adventurers so that they could protect Leilon in the future.
During the Battle of Leilon, the ancient green dragon Claugiyliamatar, possessed by the Ebondeath, crash-landed on Aubreys Peculiarities Shoppe and reduced the structure to a mound of shattered masonry.
