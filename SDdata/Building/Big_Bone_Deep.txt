Big Bone Deep was an infamous fortress that was home to the particularly savage tribe of  orcs known as the Spleen Eaters.
It was found in the Stonelands, one of the more inhospitable and untamed regions of Cormyr.
The stronghold was home to the Hidden Temple of Nishrek, a holy site of Gruumsh that housed a relic that allowed him to view the world of Toril from his divine realm.
In the , the chosen of Sune and Cyric, Joelle Emmeline and Malik el Sami respectively, ventured into the Big Bone Deep and stole the Eye of Gruumsh from within the temple. After the theft, orcs from fortress spread word to their kin across the Realms in order to apprehend the two humans.
Big Bone Deep was considered to be a place of legend, due to the near-incomprehensible savagery displayed by the orcs that called it home.
