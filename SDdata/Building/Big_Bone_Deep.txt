'''Big Bone Deep''' was an infamous fortress that was home to the particularly savage tribe of  [[orc]]s known as the [[Spleen Eaters]].

==Location==
It was found in the [[Stonelands]], one of the more inhospitable and untamed regions of [[Cormyr]].

==Structure==
The stronghold was home to the ''Hidden Temple of Nishrek'', a holy site of [[Gruumsh]] that housed a [[relic]] that allowed him to view the world of [[Toril]] from his [[Nishrek|divine realm]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the [[chosen]] of [[Sune]] and [[Cyric]], [[Joelle Emmeline]] and [[Malik el Sami]] respectively, ventured into the Big Bone Deep and stole the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' from within the temple. After the theft, orcs from fortress spread word to their kin across the Realms in order to apprehend the two [[human]]s.

==Rumors & Legends==
Big Bone Deep was considered to be a place of legend, due to the near-incomprehensible savagery displayed by the orcs that called it home.
