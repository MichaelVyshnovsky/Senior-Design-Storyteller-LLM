The '''House of Auril's Breath''', otherwise commonly referred to by locals as '''The Cold House''', was a temple dedicated to [[Auril]] in the town of [[Glister]]. It was considered to be one of the goddess's largest and most influential temples.

==Location==
This temple was located along the main road of Glister.

==Structure==
The temple had a tall, slender spire atop its roof and its structure was supported by several vertical columns.

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], there were known to be over 1600 Auril worshipers registered as members of the temple's congregation. Many of them were either fur trappers or miners, who would attend the temple's nightly Fire and Ice rituals.

==Inhabitants==
The temple was home to fourteen senior [[priest]]esses, guided by the High Hand of Ice [[Malakhar Rhenta]]. Unlike some temples of Auril, the clergy here used formal titles instead of honorifics.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some claimed that those who registered at the temple had to do so with their blood. A more popular rumor claimed that they were involved in covert political intrigue with the lands of [[Hillsfar]], [[Sembia]], [[the Vast]], and the organization [[Zhentarim]]. By extension, people claimed that priests of the temple often paid spies and agents, in the form of mercenaries and traveling merchants, with [[gem]]s.

Some claimed that these alleged gems were mined from beneath the temple, while others claimed that they came from tunnels beneath the temple that stretched out far beyond the eastern and southern edges of Glister.
