The House of Nine Blessings was a temple in Calimport dedicated to the worship of the goddess Loviatar.
The House of Nine Blessings was located in Suq Drudach, part of the Astar√© Sabban of Shackles Ward, in Calimport.
The building was constructed of white-glazed brick, which made it stand out among surrounding structures. The white bricks were offset by a black and blue mosaic of Loviatars nine-tailed scourge.
The temple was often frequented by slavers.
