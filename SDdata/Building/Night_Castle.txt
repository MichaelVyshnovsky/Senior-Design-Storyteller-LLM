The Night Castle, also known as Blacknight Manor,While it is not explicitly stated these two names refer to the same location, the fact can both only be found in The Veiled Dragon novel and their shared association with the Cult of the Dragon imply sameness.
It was situated southeast of the city of Elversult, some ways north of the nameless swamp.
The Night Castle was once a many-towered fortress before falling to ruin.
During the midâ€“14 century DR, the Maces of Elversult repeatedly chased Dragon Cult assassins back to the Night Castle, only to have it become shrouded in complete darkness.
The ruined castle was the home of Indith Shalla, a Sharran leader within the local Dragon cult, as well as a haven of the cells leader, the black Dracolich Hethcypressarvil.
