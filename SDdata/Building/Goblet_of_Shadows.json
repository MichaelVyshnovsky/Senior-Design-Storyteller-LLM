There were also pillars.\nThe Goblet was a shady place, where bar fights drew not just bets, but thrown bottles from strangers, and death screams did not disrupt activities, instead drawing applause. Bizarrely, it was not even the wildest tavern in the city.\nThe place served alcohol, including heartsfire, and had dancing ladies.\nOne evening in the late ,Per the Google Books version of Temptation, its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. shortly before the invasion of Nethra by the Lords of Laothkund, the guards Delver and Ingrath were approached by Queen Dasumia of Galadorna, who was at the moment posing as one of the tavern dancers. She revealed her identity to the guards and proposed they go somewhere more private. This was witnessed by the scholars Tabarast and Beldrune, who were drinking at the time the trio was also followed by the wandering elven mage Ilbryn Starym."
