        "Location": "The inn was located near the center of the city.",
        "Description": "The inn was in fact little more than a cheap dive with a large common room for guests to sleep in on the second floor. The bland food and cheap [[ale]] attracted customers with little coin to spend.\n\nNamed for the former owner [[Nat Wyler]], the inn's biggest attraction was the body of the deceased Old Nat himself that was displayed as a piece of mortuary art behind the bar gripping a [[bronze]] bell in his hands."
