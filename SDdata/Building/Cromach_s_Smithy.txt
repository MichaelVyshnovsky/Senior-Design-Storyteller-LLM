'''Cromach's Smithy''' was a forge that operated within the town of [[Daggerford]] for well over a century.

==Location==
While it was originally located in the town's [[Caravan Quarter]],{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==History==
The shop was originally founded by [[Cromach]], a human blacksmith who knew better than to compete with the [[Derval|local weaponsmith]] at [[Derval's Bright Blade]]. Cromach had something of a flair for artistry, as his wares were highly valued for their aesthetics as well as their functionality.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the smithy was being run by the [[dwarf]] called [[Tholvar Cragjaw]]. He continued Cromach's legacy by crafting utilitarian metal items for Daggerford's citizens.

==Lore==
There was a saying during Cromach's times that his work was "as shaky as [[Wayfel]]'s best," referring to the the proprietor of [[Wayfel's Smithy]].
