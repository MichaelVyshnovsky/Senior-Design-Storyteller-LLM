The '''House of Whelk''' was a busy Merchant House, one of the sixteen members of the [[Merchants Council]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], with its headquarters located in the [[Pumpside]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside District]].

==Location==

The House of Whelk was located in Pumpside, on the crossing of [[Samarglast Lane]] and [[Helhavryn's Walk]]. It stood one block away from the [[House of War]], a temple to [[Tempus]], and two city blocks south of the [[Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility]].

==Structure==
The house's headquarters was the second biggest building in Pumpside, after the House of War, comprised of two connected warehouses, where down-on-their-luck fishers were paid to weave nets and turn fish into spiced paste.

==Services==
The Merchant House made its money by selling [[fish]]er equipment, such as [[rope]]s, [[net]]s, and other ship gear procured for cheap across [[Faerûn]], and purchasing the catch from the same fishers, as well as purchased [[jar]]s for fish preservation. The fish was then sold at a profit, fresh and in a preserved form – [[spice]]d fish paste in jars sealed with [[wax]]. The fishpaste was a popular meal, often spread over toasted [[bread]] and eaten with [[wine]] or [[beer]].

==History==
The House of Whelk was run by [[Hlastryn Vhelturl]], a conservative and reserved merchant from [[Calaunt]] in the 14{{th}} century DR. The merchant house was named after its insignia, an image of a white shell of a [[whelk]]. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, after the [[Three Women War]], the House of Whelk was attempting to get a share of the dockloading and warehousing business in Ravens Bluff. Still, these attempts were unsuccessful, thanks to the industry being controlled by the city's guilds. If the dockloading and warehousing would prove to be completely unsuceseful, the Merchant House planned on trying its luck at building and operating a merchant fleet.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some believed that Hlastryn Vhelturl was financed by some unsavory powers from [[Hillsfar]] and [[Mulmaster]], who may have had their own reasons for controlling the Bluff's docks and having a fleet in the [[Moonsea]] and the [[Dragon Reach]] under their thumb. Similar rumors claimed that the same sponsors sought to turn [[Scardale]] and [[Harrowdale]] into fortified trade centers inhabited by criminally inclined crafters and artisans. Yet more rumors claimed that the House of Whelk was under the control of the [[Zhentarim]].
