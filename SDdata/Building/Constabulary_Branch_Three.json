        "mainbody": "Constabulary Branch Three was the third of the three major watch headquarters of the Eileanar enclave of Netheril, alongside Branch One and Branch Two.\nThe building was on the eastern edge of the enclave, near Dundadens Armory.\nthumb|280px|The constables of the enclave.\nThe ground floor of the building was partially publicly accessible, with three receptionists who handled and guided visitors. A large room behind the reception area held the desks, comfy chairs, filing cabinets, and crystal balls of twenty low-ranking constables who worked there when they werent out patrolling the streets.\nThe upper level of the structure was home to the offices of the highest-ranking constables and commissioners who reported directly to Karsus and his trusted followers such as Andoris Derathar.\nThe cellar level was an extensive underground complex made up of 200 jail cells.\nThe dutiful Chief of Constables Emblemat was assisted by his loyal Underchiefs Cadogen, Goddard, and Morian. The branchs constables were proud and hard-working, but they struggled with the constant low-level, petty crime that seemed endemic to eastern Karsus, and as a result they were overworked, short on sleep, and at times felt hopeless in the face of their task.\nEmblemat was not passive in the face of these challenges, and used several methods to shore up the confidence and enthusiasm of his constables. One policy used nowhere else in Netheril allowed the constables to keep the reward money for every criminal they caught, which greatly improved their attitudes.\nCategoryWatchhouses\nCategoryBarracks\nCategoryJails\nCategoryPrisons\nCategoryOfficial buildings\nCategoryBuildings\nCategoryLocations in Eileanar\nCategoryLocations in Netheril\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryYear of Metropolises\n2iktwr446gsfoth6agh5bxwoegrcouk"
