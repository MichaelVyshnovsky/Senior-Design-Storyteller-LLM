The '''Chapel of the Sericeous Sargh''' was an archetypical [[temple]] of [[Selvetarm]].

==Location==
The Chapel of the Sericeous Sargh was found in [[Undermountain]],

==Structure==
The entire temple consisted of a single room. It was 60 feet (18 meters) high.

==Interior==
The room's most prominent feature made of stone. This statue looked as though it was grown to the center of the eastern wall of the room. Its eight legs were arranged the following way. The four hind legs were arranged to be right at the spider's body, thus forming arch-like structures. Of the four foremost legs, two were raised above a dark altar and the other two were raised into an arch equipped with braziers. Naturally, the braziers worked only as a light source when lit. The statue was a different matter, it consistently radiated a purplish-blue light. The statue's eyes were explosives and were set 30 feet (9 meters) high. They looked like [[gem]]s but were constructs and exploded in a devastating fashion when somebody tried to take them. The statue's insides could also be accessed through the altar. It was a hiding spot for the drow and was fully equipped with a bench, breathing hole, and a chamber pot. There was also another opening in the statue that led to a [[flying spider]] that was kept there for defensive purposes. To be more precise, it protected a container that held [[scroll]]s of ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[heal]]'', and ''[[resurrection]]''.

The altar in front of the statue was set on a 20 feet by 30 feet (6 meters by 9 meters) base that was elevated. This altar radiated magic and was, as mentioned above, the entry point into the spider.

==Activities==
The temple was a launching point for Selvetargtlin patrols.

==Defenses==
The most unusual feature of this temple was that ''[[drowcraft]]'' items worked in it, despite there being no ''[[faerzress]]'' in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain. It was suspected that there was some source of it nearby.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]], an [[avatar]] of Selvetarm ran amok in [[Eryndlyn]]. This made some drow pick up the faith of Selvetarm. Selvetarm's faith was only tolerated in [[Lolth]]ite society if the [[demigod]] was invoked as a non-divine servant of the Spider Queen. However, the Selvetargtlin who eventually built the chapel worshiped the Spider Demon as a god in his own right and were effectively driven out of the city and came to Undermountain.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was believed the ultimate goal of the Selvetargtlin was to build a city dedicated to Selvetarm.

==Inhabitants==
By [[1371 DR]], Selvetargtlin called [[Eraun]] and [[Milfal]] were guarding a [[moon elf]] fletcher from the [[High Forest]] called [[Maith Slenderbow]]. Their superior was a priestess called [[Essra]] who had an entourage of seven male guards.
