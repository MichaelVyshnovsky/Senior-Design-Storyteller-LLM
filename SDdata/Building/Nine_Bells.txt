The '''Nine Bells''' was a huge warehouse built over the hulks of nine sunken ships in the [[Sargauth]] river in [[Skullport]]. The warehouse functioned as the primary market for the town. A wide variety of goods were available for purchase although availabilities varied day-to-day.{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport}}
