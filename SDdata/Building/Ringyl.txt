The '''Ringyl''' was a castle in [[Tresset's Ringyl]].

==Location==
Tresset's Ringyl was within a day's march from [[Felmorel]]. The town holding the castle was itself nestled in a valley between six hills.

==Structure==
The castle's towers were slender spires. It had tall battlements, and a wall.

==Interior==
Across one of the Ringyl's crumbling walls, there was a room that resembled a chapel, with a high and vaulted ceiling; the walls inside were painted to resemble trees with gilded fruit, and the floor had wavy bands of [[malachite]]. The far wall had a carving of a pair of lips, about as wide as a tall man's outstretched arms, surrounded by 12 or 14 irregular stars. Behind that carving was a hidden coffin on a [[Wikipedia:catafalque|catafalque]]. There was an underground level beneath the chapel.

==Defenses==
As of {{yearlink|761}}, the castle's walls were fallen.

==History==
Once, a bandit by the name of [[Tresset]] had raised the castle to anchor a realm he'd dubbed [[Tressardon]]. The kingdom didn't survive him for more than a few days. As of the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]], the castle and town were deserted, during [[Elminster Aumar]]'s wanderings in service of [[Mystra]].

After the battle between Elminster and [[Silent Antlers]], an obscure entity, the chapel inside the Ringyl crumbled apart, and the lips in the chapel shattered, a catafalque bursting out; in tilting over, the coffin fell through the ground into the lower level. Then it exploded. One of the arms of the catafalque, actually an [[enchanted]] scepter, was then reclaimed by [[Dasumia]] somehow, despite having been turned into dust by the explosion.
