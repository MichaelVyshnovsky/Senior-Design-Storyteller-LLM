Pomarts Fishery was a fishery business headquartered in Karsus Enclave that operated up to the fall of Netheril in .
The Fishery employed nearly 100 people across Netheril that operated fishing boats in all the major lakes, with the majority on the Narrow Sea in large net-dragging ships. The fishers used portals to the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice to freeze and preserve their catch, that were then distributed from the Fishery to be sold around Netheril.
