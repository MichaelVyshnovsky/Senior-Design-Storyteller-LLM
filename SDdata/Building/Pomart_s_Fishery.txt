'''Pomart's Fishery''' was a fishery business headquartered in [[Karsus Enclave]] that operated up to the fall of [[Netheril]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Services==
The Fishery employed nearly 100 people across Netheril that operated fishing boats in all the major lakes, with the majority on the [[Narrow Sea]] in large net-dragging ships. The fishers used ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]] to freeze and preserve their catch, that were then distributed from the Fishery to be sold around Netheril.
