Each person or group who entered Suzail through the great gate was stopped and asked to report their visits purpose and to present appropriate paperwork, like Cormyrs adventuring charters.\nJust like the Eastgate, and the Field-Gates, the Horngate was a citadel-like fortification that offered solid defenses to Suzails northwest entrance. Its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals barred from entering the capital of Cormyr."
