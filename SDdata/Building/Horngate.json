Each person or group who entered Suzail through the great gate was stopped and asked to report their visit's purpose and to present appropriate paperwork, like Cormyr's adventuring charters.\n\nJust like the [[East Gate (Suzail)|Eastgate]], and the [[Field-Gates]], the Horngate was a citadel-like fortification that offered solid defenses to Suzail's northwest entrance. Its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals barred from entering the capital of Cormyr."
