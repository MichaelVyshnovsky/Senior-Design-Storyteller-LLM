The '''Red House''' was a boarding house located in the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]] of [[Bral]].

==Location==
The large house was located on the trailing side of the [[Lower Market]] off [[Eel Street]].

==Structure==
While falling apart on the outside, the Red House was surprisingly well-kept and even cozy on the inside.

==Interior==
The boarding house had nine single rooms and three double rooms, which were intended for families. All were clean and comfortable. Compared to many other such locations on the [[Rock of Bral]], the Red House was a good place to stay.

==Services==
Each room cost five [[gold piece]]s per month. Boarders were only charged at the end of a month for whichever meals they had eaten, at a rate of two [[silver piece]]s per three meals eaten.

==Staff==
The Red House was owned by a [[Gnome|gnomish]] woman named [[Gertreid]], who was married to a retired pirate and tinkerer. Gertreid cooked three meals a day for her patrons.
