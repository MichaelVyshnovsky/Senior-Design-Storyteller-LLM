The Temple Bell was a shop in Athkatlas rich Temple District in the 14 century DR.
The Temple Bell stood on Aundles Walk in the Temple District, three buildings east of the busy Harfin Draether tavern.
The shop did business selling goods of religious nature. It offered accessories, holy symbols, vestments, and religious texts, all dedicated to various churches and deities of the Realms.
Before the Temple Bell took ownership of the building, it was the mansion of the Flamaerdown family of Athkatla. By the late 14 century DR, Flamaerdowns were presumed to have gone extinct and the Temple Bell shop occupied the estate.
