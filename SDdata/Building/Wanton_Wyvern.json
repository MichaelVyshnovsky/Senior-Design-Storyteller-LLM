        "History": "[[Mirt]] suggested heading for the Wanton Wyvern to [[Shandril Shessair]] after joining her at [[Tethgard]] during her voyage from [[the Dalelands]] to [[Silverymoon]] in {{yearlink|1357}}. On exiting Hullack Forest, they arrived at the Wanton Wyvern within the night. They met [[Baergasra]], a friend of Mirt's, in passing. They also met [[Thomd]], the innkeeper. While inside, Shandril briefly dozed off; when she woke up, [[Osber]], a local [[Zhentarim]] fighter, attempted to capture her. During the fight, [[Narm Tamaraith]], Shandril's husband, was poisoned. Mirt called upon Baergasra's help, and Thomd was told to draw her a bath.",
        "Inhabitants": "Osber was a regular at the tavern. Baergasra, disguised as a leprous beggar, spent two years at the gate to spy on tavern-goers. Thomd was an innkeeper for at least that long."
