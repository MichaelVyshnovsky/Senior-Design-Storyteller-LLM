'''The Golden Flute Tavern''' was a tavern opened by [[bard]] [[Dinsul]] in the [[Mortonbrace]] neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The tavern's ground floor included a bar and a kitchen. The second floor offered private booths to the customers, some VIP areas, and areas dedicated to bards' studies. Lastly, the second flood was where the tavern's guest rooms were located, often occupied by the owner's friends and guild mates.

==Location==
The Flute was located in the [[Ravens Bluff/Uptown District|Uptown District]] of Ravens Bluff, a prime location near the temple dedicated to [[Sune]], the [[Palace of Passion]], and the [[Temple of Lliira (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Lliira]].

==Services==
Apart from serving drinks and entertainment, The Golden Flute was used as a hall of training for beginner bards, offering them lodgings, education, and the stage. The tavern's attic was redesigned to serve as Dinsul students' housing. The only payment for the schooling was the students donating one percent of their performances' income to The Flute. Additionally, the tavern offered aid to any members of the [[Bard's Guild (Ravens Bluff)|Bards' Guild]].

Each evening's entertainment acts there traditionally closed by a group performance of all the school's members and Dinsul himself, playing the ''[[Golden Dragon Flute]]''. Each Friday, The Flute hosted a dance night or a ball with admission priced at a single [[gold]]en [[Raven (coin)|raven]] plus whatever drinks the attendees purchased.

==History==
Dinsul's establishment of the Flute was a great achievement and a long-running project. The tavern's opening was officially announced on the pages of the ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'', penned by [[Silvia Sinderan]], who praised Dinsul as a self-made bard and an inspiration.
