        "mainbody": "'''Whelanxdryn's of Elturel''' was a large and wide-reaching [[scabbard]]-making business in [[Elturel]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Services": "Whelanxdryn's produced [[leather]] scabbards for export across much of [[Faer√ªn]]. It had its own tannery for preparing the hides it used, and a metalworking workshop that produced the various small metal fittings that reinforced and strengthened the scabbards. The business used an ever-changing supply of cheap metal and hides from passing traders, rather than a permanent supplier. It was linked by a [[merchants' map]] to [[the Arthane Armory]] in [[Waterdeep]], which bought the scabbards for newly made [[longsword]]s and other weapons."
