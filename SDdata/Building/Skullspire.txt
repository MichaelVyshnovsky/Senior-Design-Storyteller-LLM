The '''Skullspire''' was a temple found within the [[South Faerûn|south Faerûnian]] town of [[Tulmon]] on the coast of the [[Lake of Steam]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Over the years, it served as the headquarters of the [[Myrkul]]yte [[Conclave of Doom]] as well as a holy house dedicated to [[Cyric]] and later [[Kelemvor]].

==Description==
The temple was a soaring, black tower that overlooked the surrounding town of Tulmon and the nearby ruins known as [[Crypt City]].

==History==
For many years, the Skullspire served as home to the Conclave of Doom, which presided over the [[church of Myrkul|church]] of [[Myrkul]] and overseen by [[Deep Elder Doom]] [[Haaeluth Muribaert]]. During these years, many priests of the Lord of Bones would conduct experiments in [[necromancy]], [[Animate dead|animating]] monstrous body parts such as jaws, claws and other appendages into [[undead]] abominations. These horrors would be relocated to the Crypt City via the extended subterranean tunnels that connected the ruins to Skullspire.

Following the destruction of Myrkul in the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] the clergy within Skullspire converted to the [[Church of Cyric|worship of Cyric]]. Ten years later, in [[1368 DR]], when Kelemvor ascended as the God of the Dead, the temple refocused their worship once again.

When the priests of Skullspire converted to the faith of Kelemvor, they ceased their horrific necromantic experiments within the temple. They shifted their focus to the destruction of the undead they had previously created.
