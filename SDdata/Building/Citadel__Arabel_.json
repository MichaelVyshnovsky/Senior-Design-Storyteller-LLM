        "Description": "The grand fortress was so large that it was visible from no matter where one stood in the city. It was designed primarily to be a fortress, and so it did not have many distinguishing features that did not serve it in that role.",
        "Location": "The Citadel was located in the most prosperous section of the city, the north,{{Arabel map orientation}} near the [[Arabellan Palace]] and just west of the [[Lady's House]], a temple to [[Tymora]]. It was surrounded by multiple mansions of the rich nobles and merchants of the city.\n\nThe highest lookout tower on the city walls&mdash;where [[Kelemvor]] once battled [[Knightsbridge]]&mdash;was just north of the complex.",
        "Services": "Adventuring charters, which were a requirement for [[adventurer]]s operating in Cormyr, could be acquired at the Citadel.\n\nIn addition to a jail,",
        "History": "[[Aris (giant)|Aris]], [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], and [[Ruha]] were once held prisoner overnight in the Citadel's jail for their own protection from the [[Shadovar]]."
