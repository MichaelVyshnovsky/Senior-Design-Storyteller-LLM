        "mainbody": "The Citadel was a fortress and prison in the city of Arabel in Cormyr. It was the largest building in that city and the home of the Army of the East.\nThe grand fortress was so large that it was visible from no matter where one stood in the city. It was designed primarily to be a fortress, and so it did not have many distinguishing features that did not serve it in that role.\nThe Citadel was located in the most prosperous section of the city, the north, near the Arabellan Palace and just west of the Ladys House, a temple to Tymora. It was surrounded by multiple mansions of the rich nobles and merchants of the city.\nThe highest lookout tower on the city walls&mdashwhere Kelemvor once battled Knightsbridge&mdashwas just north of the complex.\nAdventuring charters, which were a requirement for adventurers operating in Cormyr, could be acquired at the Citadel.\nIn addition to a jail,\nAris, Galaeron Nihmedu, and Ruha were once held prisoner overnight in the Citadels jail for their own protection from the Shadovar."
