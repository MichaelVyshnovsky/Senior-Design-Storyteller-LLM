'''Krostur's Forge''' was a manufacturing business in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

==Location==
This establishment was located on the south side of [[Hael Way]] on the corner with [[Galaglavur Street]]. Across Galaglavur to the northwest was [[Vandanamer's]], a popular luthdren (restaurant) and beyond that was the [[Maerador House of Welcome]] before coming to Dubrinlar, the western gate through the walls of the Iron City. Across Hael Way was [[Manycoins Hall]], the city's main bank and moneychanger.

==Services==
Krostur's Forge produced a variety of goods from metal melted in a huge furnace. The work never stopped and it created a clamor that rivaled the noisy crowd at Vandanamer's across the street.
