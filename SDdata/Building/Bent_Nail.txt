The '''Bent Nail''' was a carpentry shop on [[Trollskull Alley]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
The building was located on a corner next to the northeast entry to the alley from [[Saerdoun Street]], in front of a ground entrance to the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|Waterdhavian sewer system]].

==Structure==
The shop's main door had a small bare wooden sign that had only a large bent nail sticking out of it.

==Interior==
The front room of the shop displayed several pieces of ornate [[wood]]en furniture, [[bow]]s and [[crossbow]]s. Behind the counter, high quality [[cane]]s, [[quarterstaff]]s, and [[shield]]s lined the wall.

==Services==
The shop sold a full selection of wooden weapons and shields, as well as furniture and finely carved wood sculptures.

At the upper floors, rooms were available for rent.

==Inhabitants==
By the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[wizard]] [[Avaereene]] rented rooms above the shop. She kept her [[arcanabula|workbook]] of [[spells]] hidden under the floor of one of the rooms.

By {{Yearlink|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} the shop was owned by the [[half-elf]] [[Talisolvanar Fellbranch]], who was also its chief artisan.
