The '''Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right''' was a temple dedicated to [[Siamorphe]], the Divine Right, located in [[Waterdeep]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Chapel was located within the [[Assumbar Villa|residence]] of the [[Assumbar]] family along the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]] in the [[Sea Ward]] of Waterdeep.

==Activities==
Though relatively small, the Chapel was the center of Siamorphe's worship within [[Faerûn]]. Lord [[Laeros Assumbar]] funded the Chapel out of his own pockets.

==Inhabitants==
First High Lady Scion of Siamorphe [[Belkerri Gulderhorn]] oversaw the Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right. Lady Gulderhorn was assisted by two other ranking [[priest]]s—her niece [[Harlaa Assumbar|Harlaa]] and youngest son [[Vrom Gulderhorn|Vrom]]. Additionally, the local nobility was represented within the Chapel by six acolytes and a dozen lesser priests.
