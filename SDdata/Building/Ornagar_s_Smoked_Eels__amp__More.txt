'''Ornagar's Smoked Eels & More''' was a cannery in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].

==Location==
This store was situated in the [[Ravens Bluff/Silverscales|Silverscales]], a neighborhood in the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]] of Ravens Bluff.

==Services==
Ornagar's Smoked Eels & More processed and canned a variety of seafood including [[fish]], [[mussel]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[squid]], and of course, [[eel]]s. Despite being a seafood cannery, it was known locally for the pleasant smell of burning [[cherry wood]]. The cannery slowly smoked their [[eel]]s before packaging in tightly sealed [[jar]]s. This ensured their product remained edible as it was delivered throughout [[the Vast]] and as far north as the [[Moonsea]].
