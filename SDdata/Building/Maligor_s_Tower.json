It was located just outside the western edge of Amruthar.\nHis tower was  tall with a crenelated top.\nMaligors tower was of significant size, among the numerous rooms there were guardrooms, slave chambers, laboratories where Maligor performed unspeakable magics, a vast library, marble-floored luxurious and spacious bath where he liked to be entertained by his female slaves, and an ancient chambers deep under the tower that predated the rest of the construction. The tower had a prison that was always full and never cleaned, oftentimes the dead were left to rot beside still alive imprisoned slaves. Gnolls were used to guard the putrid complex.\nMaligor felt safe inside his tower. The towers crenelated top held experienced fighters stationed right by mounted crossbow ballistae and jugs of oil, ready to douse invading force with scorching fire. The outer granite walls were  thick with the uniform windows  wide by  high. Each window was barred or enchanted with protective spells to stop someone or something from penetrating the tower or to protect its inhabitant from scrying. Maligor had magical guards and protective wards set up all around the insides of the tower, and experienced guards and loyal slaves were scattered around all the levels of the tower.\nMaligors tower was constructed on top of much older chambers buried deep underground. The stonework appeared older than the rest of the tower indicatings its unknown origins. Maligor didnt care what they were used before, but he appropriated them to hold his army of darkenbeasts. The entrance to the underground chambers was behind a secret door on the towers ground level.\nBy 1362 DR, the tower was housing an army of gnolls, slaves, and darkenbeasts that Maligor was amassing to take over Thay.\nThe tower was teeming with slaves and guards that belonged to the evil mage. His naga assistant Asp resided there as well."
