        "mainbody": "Davy Jones Lock-Up, otherwise popularly known as simply the Lock-Up, was a very reputable storage facility in the city of Ravens Bluff.\nThis warehouse was situated seaward along the Front, in the Seaglimpse neighborhood of Ravens Bluffs Harbor District.\nThis building stood two stories tall.\nThe inside of the warehouse was divided into three areas. The largest served as the storage area. It had fifty squares painted on its floor, each measuring  by , representing rentable space. The interior of the central space was decorated with all manner of jaws from aquatic sea life, floats, and tridents. Many old nets hung from the rafters, which could be used by the warehouses security staff to capture intruders.\nThe other two areas were a high-security storage space and the buildings office. Each desk was enspelled with magic mouth, alerting those nearby whenever an attempt was made to pick the desks lock.\nThe high-security storage was almost like a separate small building within the warehouse, resembling a bank vault. It was built with three layers consisting of stone, lead, and wood. It was impenetrable by detection spells. The door to the vault had both wizard lock and glyph cast upon it, the latter inflicting a severe shock upon intruders.\nInside of the high-security storage were a set of numbered bins of various sizes with two locks.A Wedding Summons in Ravens Bluff (p. 3) summarizes these as being equivalent to modern day safety deposit boxes. One of these bins was reserved for the owner, one was reserved to the local thieves guild, and one to the citys Lord Mayor, Charles Oliver OKane.\nThe cost for renting out one of the squares on the main floor was seven silver pieces per day or two gold pieces per tenday. Payment was generally expected in advanced, although the sometimes made exceptions.\nThe Lock-Up generally didnt allow for the storage of banned goods, flammable items, or magical items. However, they didnt strictly enforce these rules, instead simply taking customers at their word that the items being stored didnt violate them.\nThe cost of renting out one of the high-security bins varied depending upon the size of the bin, ranging from 10 to 40 silver pieces per day. Each bin had two keys, one given to the renter and one kept in the possession of Davy Jones himself. Once one of the bins were opened, the renter would be directed to a small room nearby where they could have privacy.\nLate fees were not imposed upon clients until the second week of unpaid charges, wherein the going rate was doubled. On the third week of a payment being missed the stored goods would be confiscated and auctioned off to recuperate the losses. The Lock-Up held these auctions every three months.\nIn the , a thief tried and partially failed to burglarize the Lock-Up. They were caught, lost a hand in the process, and were locked up in prison. However, the goods they stole were never recovered. In the five years that followed, it was widely rumored that there had not been a successful robbery of the Lock-Up since that day.Port of Ravens Bluff (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles OKane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR.\nSometime around 1361 DR, an archaic totem was mysteriously found inside the Lock-Up one day. A group of hired adventurers went on to discover that the totem was symbol of a rising cult that had eyes on taking over the warehouse.\nAmong the businesses in Seaglimpse, Davy Jones Lock-Up was among the most well known. Its auctions drew sizable crowds and it had a reputation for being secure. This reputation of secureness was helped in part by the owners popularity among members of the City Watch and Nightwatch. As well as by the thieves guilds active forbid members from robbing the Lock-Up, in return for having their own high-security bin. They even refused to come to the aid of any members caught attempting to loot it.\nIn the rare instances when the Lock-Up was successfully robbed, significant bounties would be placed.\nThe Lock-Up was owned and operated by Davy Jones. He always had two workers on site during the day that doubled as guards and four guards stationed at night. One of these day-guards was a burly human named Karngain. Additionally, members of the City Watch sometimes moonlighted as guards.\nThe building was also protected at all hours by a trio of trained carnivorous apes named Mike, Mickey, and Pete. These apes hid themselves in the rafters and would utilize the nets hung up there to capture intruders, which would then cause an alarm bell to sound. They generally resisted the urge to feast upon intruders, unless they tried to force themselves free. In case the apes ever got out of hand, Davy kept around a ring of mammal control."
