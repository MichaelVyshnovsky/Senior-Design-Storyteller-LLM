'''Tomb of Ankh-Kephra''' was a tomb complex build for the Archmage of [[Thoth]], [[Ankh-Kephra]] and his wife [[Nephryt]] in [[Undermountain]] underneath [[Waterdeep]].

{{quote|''Did these Mulhorandi ever make anything simple? I've never seen such convoluted network of hidden passages, switches, and illusionary doors in my life! I don't think [[Halaster Blackcloak|Halaster]]'' himself could navigate this maze. Madness!''|[[Colvin Rowander]], an unlucky grave robber.}}

==Location==
The Tomb of Ankh-Kephra was built on the [[Dungeon Level]] of Undermountain. The entrance could be found by following the Mulhorandi designs to the sign that said "Tomb of Ankh-Kephra, Archmage of Thoth" and warned of the perilous dangers that laid inside.

==Interior==
The Tomb of Ankh-Kephra was constructed and decorated in accordance with the designs and traditions of the Old Kingdom of Mulhorand. Uncannily, the path that led to the tomb and its interior were clean and well maintained in contrast to other locations within Undermountain. The images and carvings depicting the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] and the history could be found throughout the massive complex. Prayers to [[Hathor]], [[Horus-Re]], [[Ptah]], [[Set]], and [[Thoth]] written in [[Mulhorandi language]] and [[common]] decorated many chambers of the crypt..

The tomb was constructed to deter any grave robbers from reaching its inner sanctum hidden deep inside the complex, with the entrance located in a huge pyramid in the center of the biggest chamber. Many winding maze-like hallways protected the pyramid chamber with traps, switches, and illusions designed to trap and scare intruders away. Inside, the tomb hid many vaults of valuables and artifacts that the wizards owned in life. Many jars of aromatic and fragrant liquids were placed inside the chambers. Deeper into the tomb, Ankh-Kephra constructed a garden chamber with fountains, sculptures, and vegetation, in imitation of Nephryt's favorite location.

Apart from illusions and traps, the tomb held [[undead]] guardians, such as armored [[skeleton]]s, [[mummies]], and [[giant scarabs]].

==History==
A long time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[wizard]]s Kephra and Nephryt created this interring complex for themselves, honoring their homeland and its traditions. Likely due to the magics hidden inside, the spouses continued their existence after death inside the tomb.

One of the enchanted items that belonged to Ankh-Kephra was a ''[[golden scarab beetle]]'' that was stolen from the tomb by some lucky thief and ended up in possession of the [[Wands]] family of Waterdeep, treated as their heirloom for generations.

During the many decades of the tomb's existence, countless adventurers tried and failed to raid Ankh-Kephra's final resting place. One such adventurer was [[Colvin Rowander]] who managed to survive long enough to get inside the large trapped hall of the tomb, where he was trapped and ripped apart by the [[skeleton]] guards and [[giant scarabs]]. Another adventurer, [[Tolem Grandelwood]], was more successful. He managed to empty one of the hidden vaults and left a bragging note for any future adventurers who managed to replicate his steps.

In [[1370 DR]], [[Marcus Wands]] stole the ''scarab'' from [[Maskar Wands]] and took it to Undermountain, hoping its magic would bring him gold. He lost the item to a monster, and the ''golden scarab'' was reclaimed by the undead Mulhorandi wizards. Trying to appease the wealthy and respected family, [[Khelben Arunsun]] sent his trusted agent to find and retrieve the golden insect. The [[Khelbenite]] was able to survive the tomb's traps and guardians, solving many-a puzzles and gaining entrance to the inner chambers within the tomb's pyramid. There the adventurer met the tomb's owners. Nephryt informed the Khelbenite of this tomb being the item's true home and asked the adventurer to leave it with the wizards and leave in peace. Agreeing to do just that, the hero was thanked for the goodly act and rewarded with the ''scarab'' to have it returned to the Wands family.
