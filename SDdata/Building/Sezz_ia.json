        "mainbody": "'''Sezz'ia''' was an outpost of the [[drow]] [[House Shobalar]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Northdark]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was where they conducted their [[arcane]] researches.",
        "History": "Around [[1372 DR]], House Shobalar was destroyed when the tunnel leading to it was sealed.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], however, [[House Faen Tlabbar]] discovered a way to it and sent an expedition. When nobody of that party returned, an alliance of [[House Xorlarrin]], [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] hired adventurers to investigate."
