It was where they conducted their arcane researches.\nAround 1372 DR, House Shobalar was destroyed when the tunnel leading to it was sealed.\nIn 1479 DR, however, House Faen Tlabbar discovered a way to it and sent an expedition. When nobody of that party returned, an alliance of House Xorlarrin, House Melarn, and Bregan Daerthe hired adventurers to investigate."
