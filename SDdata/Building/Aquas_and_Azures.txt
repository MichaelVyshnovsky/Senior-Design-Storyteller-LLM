Aquas and Azures was an exclusive jewelers and gemcutters shop in Calimport specializing in blue-colored gems around 1370 DR.
The store was located in Mayya Drudach of Najja Sabban in Wizard Ward.
Aquas and Azures was a seven-story minaret tower with no entrance at either the ground level or from the drudach or sabban wall paths. Instead, the only entrance was high up on the open balcony near the top of the tower. Thus, flying was the only way to enter the shop, and walls of force kept anyone uninvited out (though they did not trap customers in.)
One was only allowed to peruse the collection of sapphires and other blue gemstones by invitation only. If of high enough social status, a potential customer would be delivered an appointment form. At the time of the appointment, a blue flying carpet would be sent down to carry the client up to the balcony to enter the store. 
The shop was owned by a man named Melroat. He had servants on his staff.
