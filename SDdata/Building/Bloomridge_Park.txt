Bloomridge Park was a small park nestled against the [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]], just east of the [[Manor Gate]].<ref group="note">The city map in [[Baldur's Gate III]] is merely representative of a much larger Lower City. The name – Bloomridge Park implies it is located in the Bloomridge district. As such, the only point of reference that can be used in locating the park is the district's only gate, the [[Manor Gate]]. The Park had one main entrance – a large gate in the park's metal fence on the park's southwestern side. Another entrance, a smaller gate, was located on the eastern side with the groundskeeper's quarters adjacent.

The park opened into a paved plaza with a statue of [[Balduran]]. It extended away from the main gate into a round risen area built around an old tree. Pathways extended away from the plaza with a gazebo to the left of the entrance, a small pond further in towards the Old Wall, and an area with wall-carved fountains straight across the main entrance at the Old Wall. The park's paths were decorated with statues carved by [[Stoney]] and [[Boney]], two [[elemental]]s from the [[Circus of the Last Days]]. The statues were "A Tribute to Liberty."

Various medicinal plants and [[fungi]] could be found growing throughout the park, such as [[balsam]], [[autumncrocus]], [[swarming toadstool]]s, [[weavemoss]], [[mugwort]], [[rogue's morsel]]s, [[belladonna]], and others. Some of the trees in the park house honey-filled wild [[bee]] combs.

==Services==
The park was open to public and was maintained by a groundkeeper who was responsible for clearing paths off fallen branches, polishing benches, cleaning the ponds, raking leaves, exterminating pests, repainting of signage, as well as locking and unlocking the gates daily.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], [[Death's Head]] of [[Bhaal]] [[Spaulder]] led a group of [[Bhaalist]]s to massacre park-goers in the name of the Lord of Murder.

The same year, the Bloomridge Park groundskeeper, [[Lavernica]], fell victim to [[Orin the Red]] and her bloodthirsty sacrificed to Bhaal.
