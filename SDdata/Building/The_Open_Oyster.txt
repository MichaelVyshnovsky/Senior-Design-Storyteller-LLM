The Open Oyster was an inn located in the town of Yhep.
Unlike most inns, the common room of the Open Oyster lacked any chairs or tables. Instead, guests relaxed on massive piles of pillow. The inn was known for providing Calishite cuisine and meals were provided on large trays. To keep the common room cool, attractive employees used large fans made from peacock feathers to keep the guests comfortable.
