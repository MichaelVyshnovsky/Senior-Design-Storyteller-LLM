'''The Open Oyster''' was an inn located in the town of [[Yhep]].

==Services==
Unlike most inns, the common room of the Open Oyster lacked any chairs or tables. Instead, guests relaxed on massive piles of pillow. The inn was known for providing [[Calimshan|Calishite]] cuisine and meals were provided on large trays. To keep the common room cool, attractive employees used large fans made from [[peacock]] feathers to keep the guests comfortable.
