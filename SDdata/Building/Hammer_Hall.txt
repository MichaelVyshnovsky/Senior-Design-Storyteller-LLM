Hammer Hall was a log house and adjoining stables, surrounded by a wooden palisade.
Built by the adventuring group known as the Men of Hammer Hall to explore the nearby Halls of the Hammer, it became a viable place of refuge in the rugged wilderness of the North.
Hammer Hall was located near Highstar Lake, just west of Mount Hlim, in the Delimbiyr Vale.
