'''Hammer Hall''' was a log house and adjoining stables, surrounded by a wooden palisade.

Built by the adventuring group known as the [[Men of Hammer Hall]] to explore the nearby [[Halls of the Hammer]], it became a viable place of refuge in the rugged wilderness of [[the North]].

==Geography==
Hammer Hall was located near [[Highstar Lake]], just west of [[Mount Hlim]], in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].
