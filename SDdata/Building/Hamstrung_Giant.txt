The Hamstrung Giant was an inn and tavern in Eshpurta.
It was located in the southern part of the city where many of the artists, musicians, and sculptors lived, but the clientele was an equal mix of artists, soldiers, and merchants. The Hamstrung Giant was located two doors south of Major Cargunns Military and Equipment Shoppe and a short walk north and across the street from Bhamms Herbs.
The Hamstrung Giant had comfortable accommodations and a friendly atmosphere with good food and ale, moderately priced. It was known for its massive, hearty breakfasts of bacon and pancakes with honey and molasses syrup.
