The '''Hamstrung Giant''' was an inn and tavern in [[Eshpurta]].

==Location==
It was located in the southern part of the city where many of the artists, musicians, and sculptors lived, but the clientele was an equal mix of artists, soldiers, and merchants. The Hamstrung Giant was located two doors south of [[Major Cargunn's Military and Equipment Shoppe]] and a short walk north and across the street from [[Bhamm's Herbs]].

==Services==
The Hamstrung Giant had comfortable accommodations and a friendly atmosphere with good food and ale, moderately priced. It was known for its massive, hearty breakfasts of [[bacon]] and [[pancake]]s with [[honey]] and [[molasses]] syrup.
