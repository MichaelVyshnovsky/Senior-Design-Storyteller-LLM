        "Location": "The so-called Stronghold was built across the [[Trade Way]] from the town of Liam's Hold.",
        "Structure": "The keep's structure was roughly a rectangular area of carved stone with tall windowless walls. The monastery appeared more like an imposing stronghold than a religious site that could weather a siege. The main entrance was locked with a singular key, and the door was gated by a large slab of stone, pulled up by a [[pulley]] mechanism once unlocked. One could access a gorgeous view of the valley from the keep's top. A secret tunnel allowed discrete entry to the agents and monks who inhabited the site; however, it was collapsed and unusable by [[1372 DR]].",
        "Interior": "[[File:Stronghold's tower.png|thumb|''The floor carving in the Stronghold's tower.''|310x310px]]\n{{quote|''Look, a colorful floor pattern. Ohh... it's a skull... of blood... with tears... Um, let's not step on it...''|[[Purfbin Doogrick]]}}\nPast the entrance gate laid a huge [[candle]]-lit hall. Several monk quarters were adjacent to the main hall and a spiral staircase that let up and down. Each level of the staircase housed many old bookshelves and eventually led to the monastery's rooftop. The structure had a deep underground hall used as the temple by the monks and agents of the evil deity - Bhaal. The altar was carved out of a single slab of metal. A thin sharp-taloned grasping hand stretched out of the altar as if an unknown beast was trapped within the shrine.\n\nThe shrine held a secret passage locked by the key that belonged to the temple's head priest. Once unlocked, it led to a long hall with two heavy metallic gates on each side. This hidden area was the temple's vault, filled with the keep's valuables, magic items, [[gem]]s, and spell ''[[scroll]]s''.\n\nThe single tower of the monastery led directly to a round library room with the carving of Bhaal's [[holy symbol]] on the floor. The library had a single wooden door that led to the bedroom of the monastery's head priest.",
        "History": "[[File:Stronghold's shrine to bhaal.png|thumb|''The shrine to [[Bhaal]] with [[undead]] [[Xatuum]] standing guard.''|360x360px]]\nWhen a Bhaalist sect used the monastery, very few outsiders knew of the place's true nature. Monks were seemingly peaceful and traded with the farmers of Liam's Hold, all while the locals knew better than to pry too closely into the neighbors who paid well for the hamlet's produce.\n\nThe sect that occupied the monastery followed the holy text of ''[[the Treatise of Suffering]]''. Guided by the book, Bhaalist performed heinous acts of torture and cruelty. On the 13{{th}} of [[Ches]], [[1358 DR]], the monks stoked hate and fear among the inhabitants of Liam's Hold, leading them to burn a woman on a stake in the middle of the town. The Bhaalists manipulated the locals into believing the woman was a [[witch]], while her deathly sufferings brought joy to the Lord of Murder. On the 15{{th}} of Ches, 1358 DR, the High Priest [[Xatuum]] culled the number of his followers after rumors of spies spread throughout the Stronghold. The monks refilled the basement shrine's blood pools with the help of those slain. On the 4{{th}} of [[Tarsakh]], the Bhaalists captured five children who were tortured to death to please their deity.\n\nShortly before the Time of Troubles, on the 16{{th}} of [[Eleint]], a small force of [[druid]]s and [[elves]], led by [[Maerovyna]] of the [[Harvest House]], stormed the walls of the temple of Bhaal. The monks successfully repelled the assault with minimal losses and minimum damage to the Stronghold's walls.\n\nDuring the Time of Troubles, when gods walked on [[Toril]], the Bhaalist agents and monks who resided in the temple mysteriously disappeared. The truth of the priests' disappearance was grim indeed. The worshipers were sacrificed in a futile attempt to reach their deity when gods walked the Realms.\n\nA [[bard]] adventurer from [[Waterdeep]] discovered the monastery's dark secret and left the only key to the keep with Mayor [[Wilsey]] for safekeeping.\n{{fq\n| text =Yes, this place would have had potential as a quiet hideout.

        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Bhaal skeleton NWN.jpg|thumb|''One of the undead Bhaalist worshipers.''|343x343px]]\nThe priests of Bhaal who lived in the monastery were returned to a semblance of life as yellowed decrepit [[undead]] [[skeleton]]s after sacrificing themselves during the Time of Troubles. The undead creatures were scattered across the basement temple, ready to be reanimated by dark magics and attack any blasphemous this defiling the old temple. The undead were led by Xatuum, an undead gaunt intelligent creature who revered his evil god even after death.\n\nAnother cleric of note was [[Niaal Sortan]], the cruel wielder of ''[[the Black Hammer]]''.\n\nThe hidden vault, behind the undercroft's altar of Bhaal was guarded by three [[gargoyle]]s that were ready to rend any looter."
