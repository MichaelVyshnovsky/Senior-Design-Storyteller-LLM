'''Feathergale Spire''' was a tower in the [[Dessarin Valley]] occupied by the [[Feathergale Knights]], a society from [[Waterdeep]] in service of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1491}}.

==Structure==
The tower was built on a pillar of rock in a canyon, and was the tallest point for miles. It was built from white [[limestone]] and embellished in [[marble]]. It resembled a gleaming sword. The only point of entry was a drawbridge.
