        "mainbody": "The '''Feathered Rat''' was a pet shop within the city of [[Skullport]].",
        "Location": "This store was situated in Skullport's lowest level, the slums known as [[Dredge|the Dredge]]. It was just left of the [[Guts and Garters]], just around the corner north of the residence of [[Amet'ned-toth]]'s, and just around the corner east of the [[Hell Hound's Muzzle]] tavern.",
        "Structure": "This store was a one-story structure.",
        "Interior": "The Feathered Rat was considered to be a business of fair condition, though the smell of its animals emanated throughout. Lining its walls were shelves holding cages of various sizes. To cut down on the odor of its animals and to keep it dry, the floor was covered in sawdust and wood shavings.\n\nIn the center of the shop stood a completely enclosed, cubic [[glassteel]] aquarium measuring {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} wide.",
        "Services": "The Feathered Rat sold a variety of animals as pets that the owners had raised and tamed. Their stock typically consisted of [[cat]]s, [[giant rat]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[raven]]s, and [[owl]]s. Occasionally they carried more exotic animals, such as [[pseudodragon]]s.\n\n''Circa'' [[1492 DR]], their stock had expanded to include [[bat]]s for 5 [[cp]], [[lizard]]s for 5 cp, mundane [[rat]]s for 5 cp, mundane [[spider]]s for 5 cp, [[giant fire beetle]]s for 25 [[gp]], and [[stirge]]s for 10 [[sp]]. Around this time They also sold cats for 5 sp, frogs and toads for 5 cp, and giant rats for 10 sp.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Feathered Rat was lived in and operated by a pair of ex-[[adventurer]] lovers, [[Salmarin Bearfriend]] and [[Ulvira Snowveins]]. They lived with a pair of [[blink dog]]s, named [[Yapp]] and [[Yuff]]. In addition to the other animals within their store, the couple had a furious [[water weird]] trapped within their glassteel aquarium that was always attempting to escape."
