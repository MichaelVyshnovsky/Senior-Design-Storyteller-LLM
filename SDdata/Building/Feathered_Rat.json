        "mainbody": "The Feathered Rat was a pet shop within the city of Skullport.\nThis store was situated in Skullports lowest level, the slums known as the Dredge. It was just left of the Guts and Garters, just around the corner north of the residence of Ametned-toths, and just around the corner east of the Hell Hounds Muzzle tavern.\nThis store was a one-story structure.\nThe Feathered Rat was considered to be a business of fair condition, though the smell of its animals emanated throughout. Lining its walls were shelves holding cages of various sizes. To cut down on the odor of its animals and to keep it dry, the floor was covered in sawdust and wood shavings.\nIn the center of the shop stood a completely enclosed, cubic glassteel aquarium measuring  wide.\nThe Feathered Rat sold a variety of animals as pets that the owners had raised and tamed. Their stock typically consisted of cats, giant rats, ferrets, frogs and toads, ravens, and owls. Occasionally they carried more exotic animals, such as pseudodragons.\nCirca 1492 DR, their stock had expanded to include bats for 5 cp, lizards for 5 cp, mundane rats for 5 cp, mundane spiders for 5 cp, giant fire beetles for 25 gp, and stirges for 10 sp. Around this time They also sold cats for 5 sp, frogs and toads for 5 cp, and giant rats for 10 sp.\nThe Feathered Rat was lived in and operated by a pair of ex-adventurer lovers, Salmarin Bearfriend and Ulvira Snowveins. They lived with a pair of blink dogs, named Yapp and Yuff. In addition to the other animals within their store, the couple had a furious water weird trapped within their glassteel aquarium that was always attempting to escape."
