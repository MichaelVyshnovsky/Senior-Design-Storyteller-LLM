        "mainbody": "aks Apothecary was an apothecary shop located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe shop was located in south Zhentil Keep in the center of the Foreign Quarter along Zhent Avenue.\nRaks Apothecary was a two story structure. The houses neighboring Raks Apothecary were vacant since the entire neighborhood tired of dealing with the unending barrage of vile odors and occasional explosions coming from the shop.\nThe shop sold all sorts of medicines, spell components, herbs, and similar items. The shop purchased monster parts harvested by others for use in potions.\nThe shop was owned by the eccentric, and somewhat insane, gnome illusionist named Rak Alumeater."
