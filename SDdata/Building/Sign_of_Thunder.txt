'''The Sign of Thunder''' was an inn in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]], run by [[Boris Elberwelter]] and [[Tasha]].

It was the biggest inn in Thunderstone at the time, and it hosted countless [[adventuring companies]]. They used the inn as a base for their activities, and to share information about good places to explore and those to avoid. The inn grew very rowdy each night.

Rooms cost 5 [[gp]] a night and a meal with ale cost 2 gp, while a lukewarm bath could be had for 2 [[sp]].
