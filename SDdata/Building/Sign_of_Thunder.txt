The Sign of Thunder was an inn in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR, run by Boris Elberwelter and Tasha.
It was the biggest inn in Thunderstone at the time, and it hosted countless adventuring companies. They used the inn as a base for their activities, and to share information about good places to explore and those to avoid. The inn grew very rowdy each night.
Rooms cost 5 gp a night and a meal with ale cost 2 gp, while a lukewarm bath could be had for 2 sp.
