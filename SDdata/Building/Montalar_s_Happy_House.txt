'''Montalar's Happy House''' was a popular eatery open dawn-to-dusk that stood on the [[Swordstars Lane]] in [[Suzail]] and served the area's warehouse workers.

==Location==
Montalar's Happy House was separated by a [[cart]] alley from [[Jharko's Coffers and Crates]]—its neighbor to the west. The cart alley connected the Swordstars Lane to the warehouses at the center of the block. The decaying manor of [[Talarkgates]] stood behind Montalar's.

==Structure==
The eatery was on the first floor of a three-story building. Bhaerusk and his family lived on the second floor above the Happy House and rented out apartments on the third floor. The building also had a spacious cellar. The first floor and the cellar both had back entrances, usually cluttered with food crates and covered in [[runner-vine]]s grown by the proprietors annually. The roof of the building was decorated with laundry lines.

==Services==
The dining hall was open at the first rays of dawn and closed its shutters at dusk every day. Montalar's Happy House sent all clients to search drunken debauchery and entertainment elsewhere.

During work hours, the eatery served [[cider]] during all times of the year–ice-cold in the sweltering summer months and hot when it was chilly outside. Among alcoholic drinks, they offered weak [[ale]], and local favorite sweet [[berry wine]], also low in alcohol content. Another specialty of the Happy House were [[happy helm]]s–a type of handfood pastry. These handfoods were often sold out of a quick service window on the side of the eatery. The window always attracted a long line of hungry customers offering a good price, just a [[copper]] for two happy helms.

==Inhabitants==
The restaurant was run by [[Bhaerusk Montalar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His four daughters, wife, and wife's two sisters were the Happy House's staff.

==Rumors & Legends==
* As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, local gossip talked about the reason for the happy helms' strong-tasting sauce was that it makes people buy more drinks and that it hid the taste of chopped [[rat]].
* Yet another rumor claimed that Bhaerusk rented the restaurant's cellar to anyone who was willing to pay for the digression, no questions asked.
