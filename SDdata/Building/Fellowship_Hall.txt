Fellowship Hall was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Fellowship of Innkeepers.
The Fellowship Hall was located along Waterdeep Way, in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
This guildhall stood three-stories tall.
Once every tenday, the Fellowship Hall was opened by the guild leader, the Master of Hospitality, as an inn open to members only. This was to allow guild members the chance of enjoying the comforts of an inn as patrons.
The Fellowship Hall was among some of the more notable and recognizable guildhalls in the Castle Ward. Like other guildhalls in the Castle Ward, it was considered by locals to be a landmark.
