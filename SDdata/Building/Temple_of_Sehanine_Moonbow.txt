'''Temple of Sehanine Moonbow''' was an open-air temple to the goddess of mysticism and the moon, [[Sehanine Moonbow]] that served the guests of the [[Myth Drannor|City of Song]] and its rulers that resided in the [[Castle Cormanthor]].

==Location==
Temple of Sehanine Moonbow was built close to the [[Castle Cormanthor]] to provide its inhabitants with easy access to [[cleric]]s, councilors, and seers.

After the city was ruined by the [[Weeping War]], the temple bordered an area of ''[[Dead-magic zone|dead magic]]'' to the Castle Cormanthor's north.

==Interior==
The majestic open-air temples consisted of a plaza, pillars that held gentle [[silk]]en curtains, a simple shrine to the goddess, and a small barrack building that the clerics of the templed lived in.

The ''illusion'' magic that protected the templed past the Weeping War showed nothing but ruins and rubble but creatures that knew of the temple's existence could see its vague outlines through the ''illusion''.

The temple was protected from creatures that roamed the ruins not only by the ''illusions'', but also by ''[[antipathy]]'' spells against creatures of evil alignment, the ''[[hallow]]'' spell, and the ''[[consecrate]]'' spell.

The east side of the temple was overgrown with ''[[blueglow moss]]''.

==History==
When Myth Drannor fell in the Weeping War, in [[714 DR]], the clerics of Sehanine Moonbow placed series of ''[[illusion]]s'' and ''dream magics'' to mask the temple from the casual eyes and save it from desecration. The temple appeared nothing more than a plot of land filled with rubbles.

The temple remained safe under the ''illusion'' through [[1369 DR]]
