        "mainbody": "he Oakenhall, or simply the House of Silvanus to the outsiders, was the most prominent temple dedicated to Silvanus, the Oak Father, in the Vilhon Reach and located on the isle of Ilighôn.\nA holy site for the worshipers of the Forest Father was located on the plateau atop the Elder Spires at the heart of Ilighôn. It could be reached by the long winding stone-stepped Hierophant trail, a walkway that led to the temple from the small city of Sapra.\nThe Oakenhall was an open structure of granite and wood, surrounded by cold mountain river waters that formed beautiful waterfalls and covered the House of Silvanus with mist. These waters cascaded down the Elder Spires, forming the Calling River, Elder River, and Springbrook. Older druids and pilgrims could be found praying along the banks of the Oakenhall.\nThe druidic conclave was an important part of the Emerald Enclave. Any individual who wished to join the organization had to eventually make a pilgrimage to the Oakenhall to complete the initiation ceremony. The House of Silvanus was the only place on Toril where questioning and disagreements among the members of the Emerald Enclave were allowed to be aired. Outside of the temple, Emerald Enclave was to stand in a single united front at all times.\nThe Oakenhalls stone steps were defended by one of Eldaths water elementals. Whatever magics guided the elemental, it was unheard of for the creature to attack innocent travelers unprovoked.\nThe Oakenhall was established by the followers of Silvanus during a ceremony in Midsummer Night in the . The House of Silvanus initially was a small druidic conclave for those who mastered shapechanging and was able to reach the island in a shape of a bird. Thr temples construction was finished just a few years later.\nIn the , druids of the Oakenhall officially joined the Emerald Enclave."
