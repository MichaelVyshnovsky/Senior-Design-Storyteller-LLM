The eight elevated nests and roosting areas were well-separated from one another, extending far above the streets of the city.\nHousing for a variety of mounts, both terrestrial and airborne were provided at the Wing Stables, including accommodations for unicorns, moon-horses, hippogriffs, and even pegasi. \nThe uppermost aeries were reserved for the dragons that served the commanders of AkhVelahrs Wing & Horn aerial cavalry."
