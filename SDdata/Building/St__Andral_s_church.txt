'''St. Andral's Church''' was a temple in the village of [[Vallaki]] dedicated to the Morninglord,{{Cite dungeon/207/Fair Barovia|44,48,51}} a [[deity]] that was merely an alias of the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] solar god [[Lathander]] and whose faith was started by the [[Church of Lathander|Lathanderite]] [[Martyn Pelkar]].<ref>

==Description==
This temple was slouching in appearance, with a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked stained glass windows that depicted saints. Outside of the temple proper was a garden of gravestones, enclosed within a wrought [[iron]] fence. By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the building appeared to be centuries old.{{Cite dungeon/207/Fair Barovia|50}}

Beneath the main altar of the temple was a crypt, holding the bones of its namesake [[St. Andral]], a fact that was known only by the head priest.

==Activities==
Services were held in the temple at dawn and dusk,{{Cite dungeon/207/Fair Barovia|51}} wherein the attending [[priest]] offered the congregation prayers and reassurance that they were protected by St. Andral.

For a small donation of at least 10 [[gold piece]]s and the cost of the necessary [[material component]], the high priest would create [[holy water]] or cast the [[spell]]s ''[[gentle repose]]'', ''[[iron vigil]]'', or ''[[purify water]]''.{{Cite dungeon/207/Fair Barovia|48}}

==Inhabitants==
In the 15{{th}} century DR this temple was operated by the elderly Father [[w:c:ravenloft:Lucian Petrovich|Lucian Petrovich]] and a couple of young novices, including an orphaned altar boy named [[w:c:ravenloft:Yeska|Yeska]].

==History==
At some point in the 15{{th}} century DR, a coffin-maker living in Vallaki named [[w:c:ravenloft:Henrik van der Voort|Henrik van der Voort]] learned of the location of St. Andral's bones. He paid a desperate young Vallakian named [[w:c:ravenloft:Milivoj|Milivoj]] to break into it at night. There boy pried open its floor boards with a [[shovel]] in order to access its crypt and stole the bones of St. Andral for him in return for food money. Father Lucian was quick to suspect Milivoj of the crime, but was reluctant to confront him due to the boy's temper.

With the bones in his possession, Henrik planned to pass them along to the vampire spawn living in his attic and keeping him prisoner so they could launch an assault upon the temple, though at some point [[adventurer]]s interfered in his plans.
