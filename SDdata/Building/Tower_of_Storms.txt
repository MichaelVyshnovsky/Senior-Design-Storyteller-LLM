The Tower of Storms was a lighthouse on the Sword Coast North which became a temple dedicated to Talos, god of storms.
The lighthouse was located atop an  rocky outcropping which sat about  off the coast of the Sea of Swords. It was due west of Phandalin During low tide, travelers could descend the  coastal cliffs overlooking the tower to a sandy beach and a narrow causeway which connected the tower to the shore. 
In the late 15 century DR, a number of ships sat wrecked on the rocks beneath the lighthouse.
The Tower of Storms consisted of a squat,  tall stone building with a lighthouse rising another  from the seaward side. A large lightning rod stood on the buildings roof. The lighthouse beacon was open to the elements and surrounded by an iron railing.
The ground-floor structure contained a shrine to the god of storms, Talos. The  high chapel was adorned with frescoes depicting ships being tossed in a violent storm with Talos watching approvingly. The lighting rod on the roof connected through the ceiling to an altar, and when struck with lightning, the altar could be used to bestow a divine blessing allowing for limited casting of the lightning bolt spell.
The Tower of Storms was considered old by residents of Phandalin as of the late 15 century DR. 
Around that time, the tower became a base for the barbaric Cult of Talos.
A sea elf banshee named Miraal haunted the causeway connecting the tower to the shore, and a tribe of harpies nested on the southern side of the outcropping on which the tower was built. An awakened giant crab was known to make its home on the nearby beach and hunter sharks prowled the nearby wrecks, including the dangerous Daggermaw.
