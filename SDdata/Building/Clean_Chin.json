        "mainbody": "Garick Honestone\nThe Clean Chin was a business in Daggerford that operated as both a barber shop and a mortuary. It was long-standing institution within the town, having remained in the same location in the River Quarter for well over 100 years. As of the 1480s DR, the Clean Chin was owned and operated by Hunnett Honestone, the daughter of its founder.\nIt could be found in the River Quarter of Daggerford, right next to the towns barracks along the eastern perimeter of the drill field.\nThe ground level of the Clean Chin was partitioned in half, with either side catering to each of the shops two services. Above the shop was the personal residence of the dwarven Honestone family.\nIt was quite unique in that the business offered the normal services of a barber and hairstylist, as well as those for the recently deceased.\nThe Clean Chins founder, Garick Honestone, originally ran an undertakers business called The Fallen Man. It was not particularly successful.\nPerplexed as to why men insisted on shaving their faces, Garick decided one day to do the same to one of the bodies in his shop. He was wholly delighted by the entire process and decided to change the name of the establishment and expand the services he offered.\nWhen Garick passed away, his daughter Hunnett took over the business."
