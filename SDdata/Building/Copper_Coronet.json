        "mainbody": "he Copper Coronet was a very large, but depressingly dingy tavern located in the River District of Athkatla. It attracted the lowest rung of Athkatlan society smugglers, pirates and the \"blank-for-hire\" type of independent entrepreneurs. Tourists to the city, and even most citizens of Athkatla refused to step one foot within its doors.\nThe Coronets taproom was dominated by its notably long bar off its side was a small privy, which was absolutely disgusting and smelled of sea-water. Behind the bar was the taverns kitchen, which had an underground pantry.\nthumb|Copper Coronets rowdy clientele.|350x350px\n 1369\nUp until the year 1369 DR, the Copper Coronet was owned by the wealthy, suspicious and completely unscrupulous slave-trader Lehtinan. The bar was run by Bernard.\n1370-\nSome time after 1370 DR the Copper Coronet changed hands to \"Old Sarvo\", a weary man who, despite his surroundings, managed to maintain his sense of humor.\nSarvo was supported, in great effort, by four bartenders Bordovan, Delric, Othlo and Vaermaer. These mountains of men at the Coronet, acting as the bars protectors and bouncers.\nThe taverns two cheerful barmaids were Jalith and Maerae, who genuinely had a great time serving the patrons of the Copper Coronet, despite its filth and danger. They always treated their customers with honestly and genuine joy.\nBehind the bar, in the taverns kitchen was the Coronets surly cook, Old Skratha, This old, ill-tempered women had the warts and temperament of a troll, which likely contributed to the rumors that she had monstrous heritage.\nthumb|Copper Coronets interior.|420x420px\n1369\nWhile under the ownership of Lehtinan, the Coronet offered a scant variety of drinks including Bitter Black, Amnian ale, Shadowdark ale, Suzale and a brew from Golden Sands.\n1370\nThe big draw of the Copper Coronet were the \"sarks\" prepared and provided by Old Skratha. These meals consisted of hallowed-out chunks of stale roundbread, filled with a watery stew made from the guts of bottom-feeder fish, dog and rat meat, dew-worms and herbs gathered from the Grave District. In spite its contents, it was a greatly-appreciated meal by local river district Athkatlans, as it was typically the only meal they could afford.\nWhen Sarvo found a good enough price, he would purchase casks of watered-down ale or wine to serve at the bar."
