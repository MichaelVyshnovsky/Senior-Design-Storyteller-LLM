        "mainbody": "he Keep of Gond was a temple dedicated to Gond in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThis temple was located in the Low City of Bral, on Sailmaker Street across the road from the base of the Golden Brotherhood, in an out-of-way place.\nA wide variety of odd and at times annoying inventions filled this small shrine. Notably there was an articulated statue of Gond, depicting him as an aged gnome of particularly diminutive and crooked build, which could be worrying, even heretical, to Gondar from Toril, where he was traditionally shown as human. It was able to rise on its own and collect offerings to the Wonderbringer.\nThe Keep of Gond was founded by three gnomish priests who brought the faith to wildspace, but it remained obscure as of the 1360s DR.\nWhile a few human worshipers of Gond attended service at the temple, it was primarily popular among the gnomish community of Bral."
