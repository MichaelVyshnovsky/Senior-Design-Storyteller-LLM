        "mainbody": "aerelds Hold was a keep in the western part of Sembia.\nThe country manor had been built on a hill covered with woods to the north of the River Arkhen and just a short distance east of the boundary between Archendale and Sembia. The hold was encircled by thick, dim woods, and only a few individuals chose to live there.\nFaerelds Hold was built of stone. During its history, the original keep was expanded with new wings. Although these annexes to the building had worn out and broken by the late 15 century DR, the main building still stood fast.\nThe keep included some dungeons. At some point, monsters from the Underdark tunneled into these dungeons.\nThe original owner and namesake of the hold was Unstran Faereld. He was succeeded by a number of human owners.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the manor had become a residence for a succession of different monsters from the Upperdark, some with lesser monstrous servants, who had taken the place of the humans."
