        "Location": "The country manor had been built on a hill covered with woods to the north of the [[River Arkhen]] and just a short distance east of the boundary between [[Archendale]] and Sembia. The hold was encircled by thick, dim woods, and only a few individuals chose to live there.",
        "Structure": "Faereld's Hold was built of stone. During its history, the original keep was expanded with new wings. Although these annexes to the building had worn out and broken by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the main building still stood fast.\n\nThe keep included some dungeons. At some point, [[monster]]s from the [[Underdark]] tunneled into these dungeons.",
        "History": "The original owner and namesake of the hold was [[Unstran Faereld]]. He was succeeded by a number of [[human]] owners.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, the manor had become a residence for a succession of different monsters from the [[Upperdark]], some with lesser monstrous servants, who had taken the place of the humans."
