'''The Dancing Dwarves''' was a mysterious stone circle that stood on the edge of a cliff in [[Calimshan]].

==Location==
The Dancing Dwarves stood, or more precisely, leaned off a cliff just south of the [[Seminary of St. Ihrvyn]] and south of the [[Spider Swamp]] and to the northwest from the sunken ruins of the [[marid]] city of [[Ajhuutal]].

==Structure==
The Dwarves were a stone circle of four massive blocks of [[granite]]. Their sides were carved with images of squat figures with no pattern or writing that could explain the significance of the structure, carvings, or the location of the Dancing Dwarves. The monoliths could not be damaged in any way. For example, if stricken with a [[hammer]] and [[chisel]], the person attempting to do the damage received a wound as if someone had stricken them with a hammer and chisel.

==History==
The Dancing Dwarves were in existence during the days of the [[Shoon Imperium]] in Calimshan and possibly predated it. During that time, the Dancing Dwarves were often chiseled to no success.
