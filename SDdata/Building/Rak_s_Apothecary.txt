'''Rak's Apothecary''' was an [[apothecary]] shop located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The shop was located in south Zhentil Keep in the center of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] along [[Zhent Avenue]].

==Description==
Rak's Apothecary was a two story structure. The houses neighboring Rak's Apothecary were vacant since the entire neighborhood tired of dealing with the unending barrage of vile odors and occasional explosions coming from the shop.

==Activities==
The shop sold all sorts of medicines, [[spell component]]s, herbs, and similar items. The shop purchased [[monster]] parts harvested by others for use in [[potion]]s.

==Inhabitants==
The shop was owned by the eccentric, and somewhat insane, [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] named [[Rak Alumeater]].
