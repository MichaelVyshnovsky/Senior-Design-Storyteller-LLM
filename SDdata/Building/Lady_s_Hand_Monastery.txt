The '''Lady's Hand Monastery ''' was a temple dedicated to [[Loviatar]] on [[Ladypeak]].

==History==
In the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], the tower of Lady's Hand collapsed under the attacks of a [[Morueme]] [[dragon]], which was later torn asunder mid-flight by the monks' Netherese magic. After that, more Morueme dragons destroyed most of the buildings in the monastery but were unable to wipe out the monks who, in the meantime, retreated into the caves. The Moruemes then sent a small army of [[hobgoblin]]s to execute the final assault, but the monks prevailed once again.

However, winter likely drove the monks out.

==Activities==
About ninety priests ([[human]] and [[half-elf]]) resided in this fortified temple and in the caves under the abbey. These [[monk]]s were able to repel attacks by [[orc]]s and other monsters using ancient [[Netherese]] [[magic]]. The monks had a bad reputation in the surrounding area, because travelers passing by tended to disappear mysteriously.

During the dragon assault, the monks of the Lady's Hand Monastery created and equipped themselves with simply called ''[[monk's belt]]s''. These enchanted items improved their skill, made their strikes deadly, and gave the edge of magical ''[[haste]]''.

After the dragon assault, High Whipmistress [[Lorthalae Shamrass]] ruled a clergy just over forty strong, who were involved in rebuilding the fortress.
