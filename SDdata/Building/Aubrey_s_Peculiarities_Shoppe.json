        "mainbody": "'''Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe''' was a store in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The proprietor was the [[ghost]] of [[Aubrey Silverspun]], a member of the [[Swords of Leilon]] who had died during the [[Spellplague]].",
        "Location": "The shop was located on the north-west side of the town, overshadowed by the [[High Tower of Thalivar]].",
        "Interior": "The three [[adventurer]]s that formed the Swords of Leilon were featured on a painted triptych above the counter: a dark-skinned warrior lady named [[Augusta Krul]], a red-bearded [[dwarf]] named [[Ogri Ninebeards]], and the shop's owner, Aubrey Silverspun, whose face had faded over time.",
        "Services": "The shop sold trinkets and [[magic item]]s and only appeared for certain individuals.",
        "History": "When Leilon was destroyed and Aubrey was killed during the Spellplague after [[1385 DR]], he became bound to Leilon's ruins as a ghost. By the early 1490s DR, great strides had been made to rebuild the town. Aubrey kept a close eye on the town's reconstruction to prevent another calamity. In Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe, he sold magic items to new adventurers so that they could protect Leilon in the future.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Leilon]], the ancient [[green dragon]] [[Claugiyliamatar]], possessed by the [[Chardansearavitriol|Ebondeath]], crash-landed on Aubrey's Peculiarities Shoppe and reduced the structure to a mound of shattered masonry."
