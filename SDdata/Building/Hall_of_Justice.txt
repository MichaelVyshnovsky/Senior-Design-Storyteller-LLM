The '''Hall of Justice''' was the temple of [[Tyr]] in the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==Location==
The Hall of Justice was located on a cliff overlooking the [[Sea of Swords]] on the south bank of the [[Neverwinter River]] near its mouth. It was directly across the [[Neverwinter#Layout|Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] from [[Castle Never]].

Before the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], the Hall of Justice was located in the [[City Core (Neverwinter)|City Core]], and after the rebuilding efforts of the late years of the [[1470 DR|1470s DR]] decade, it was located in the [[Protector's Enclave]].

==Structure==
The gleaming, castle-like church was built from stone, [[iron]], and wood,

==Interior==
The church was notable for its high ceilings

The interior was only mildly decorated, reflecting the sensibilities of an era in Neverwinter's history that was concerned with temperance and justice. It had several rooms for daily routines and worship. The high priest had his own apartment in the temple.

==Activities==
In [[1368 DR]], the Hall of Justice was presided over by Judge [[Oleff Uskar]], ably assisted by Prior [[Hlam]]. Judge Uskar presided over the city's low justice—legal proceedings for citizens not of noble birth or accused of high crimes—while Hlam trained acolytes of Tyr in the meaning of justice and the martial arts.

==History==
===The Wailing Death===
[[File:Hall of Justice statue tyr.png|thumb|''A statue of [[Tyr]] in [[Neverwinter]]'s Hall of Justice.'']]
During the [[Wailing Death]] of [[1372 DR]], the Hall was used as a base from which the search for the [[Waterdhavian]] creatures was launched as well as a sanatorium for plague victims. Judge Oleff also coordinated his search for the tomb of [[Halueth Never]] from the temple.

Once Neverwinter had been rebuilt after the war with [[Luskan]], the Hall of Justice was re-established. It was the place where prospective disciples of Tyr could join, if they met the requirements.

The [[Kalach-Cha]] could have requested [[Khelgar Ironfist]] to become a [[monk]]. Hlam would ask Khelgar to find the reason for why he fought, to reconcile with those he had hurt. and to see all people equally. Once all these things had been completed, Khelgar could join as a monk.

When the Kalach-Cha proved themself innocent at the court after being accused of killing the villagers of [[Ember]], Torio asked for a trial by battle. The Kalach-Cha was asked to come to the Hall, where Hlam would take them to a room for meditation before the battle. During the time, the Kalach-Cha's companions could visit them.

===Post-Spellplague===
When Tyr gave up his divinity to [[Torm]], the residents of Neverwinter refused to rededicate the temple, and so the Tyrran faith remained strong in Neverwinter even after the death of the god himself.

After the Ruining, the Hall of Justice was one of the few buildings left almost untouched by the cataclysm.

When [[Dagult Neverember]] arrived in the city in [[1469 DR]], he chose the Hall of Justice to be his seat of government. He took the high priest's apartments for his office and quarters and conducted business in the audience chamber.

Around [[1489 DR]], when followers of Tyr went to Neverwinter to restore the temple of their god, Neverember gladly returned to them the Hall of Justice and moved into a private villa. This action made him even more worthy of a leader in the eyes of the Neverwintans.

==Trivia==
After Dagult Neverember installed himself in the Hall of Justice, his detractors, specially the [[Sons of Alagondar#The Nashers|Nashers]], began to call the temple "the Hall of Never-Justice".
