The '''Citadel of Carifar''' was the seat of power in [[Nimpeth]], one of the [[Free Cities of the Vilhon Reach]].

==Location==
The Citadel of Carifar stood at the center of Nimpeth.

==History==
The palace was constructed ''circa'' [[970 DR]] via cruel slave labor. The Citadel was considered to be the second-most impressive product of unwilling labor in the city, after the [[Woren Vineyards]], built in the [[Broken Hills]] outside the city walls.

Around [[1370 DR]], the Citadel of Carifar belonged to the Lord of Nimpeth, [[Woren]], who also owned the the Woren Vineyards.
