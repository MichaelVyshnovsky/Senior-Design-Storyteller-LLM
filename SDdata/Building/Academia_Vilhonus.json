        "Location": "The building that housed the Academia Vilhonus rose above the city of Arrabar from its central [[Arrabar/Governor District|Governor District]]. It stood south of the [[Generon]]. The college's walls were covered in lush green vines. The length of the library building was over {{SI|40'|'\"|long=yes}}.",
        "Interior": "The Academia Vilhonus had an impressive library, filled to the brim with a wide variety of [[Category:History books (in-universe)|history books]]. However, many of them were influenced by Chondathan politics past and present.",
        "History": "The Academia Vilhonus was founded some years before the {{YearlinkName|300}}, the year it popularized the facial markings that would become Chondath's tradition for centuries to come. The Academia Vilhonus introduced circular forehead markings to differentiate the learned folk of Chondath from the slave class and other \"lessers\" in the eyes of the academics and upper class. A single dot placed on a student's forehead indicated their ability to read, two their ability to write, and three their use of [[the Art]]. Initially, the dots were nothing but a fashion statement, but with time the markings became identification enforced and protected by Chondathan law.\n\nAt some point before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Adamar Session]], [[Bard]] of [[Starmantle]], visited the Academia Vilhonus during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the Vilhon Reach. The bard spent his time in the academy's massive libraries, a visit he later recounted in his guidebook to the Vilhon Reach."
