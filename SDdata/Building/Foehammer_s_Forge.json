        "mainbody": "Foehammers Forge was a renowned smithy found in the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 and late 15 centuries DR. Its proprietor was the dwarf master smith Ghelryn \"Goldhand\" Foehammer.\nGhelryn produced a large quantity and variety of metalwork items that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast. The quality of his metal and his craftsmanship was above average, and his prices cheaper. In particular, his eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins were crucial to the success of Wainwrights Wagons and other wagon repairmen in town.\nThe forge was located in the north end of town, on the west side of the Long Road and across the way from Uldinaths Arms. Foehammers and Uldinaths enjoyed a long-standing but amiable rivalry.\nFoehammers Forge was well-established in Triboar by the mid-1360s DR.\nBy the late 1480s DR, Ghelryn was growing too old for day-to-day work and had begun looking for an apprentice, but could not find any who met his standards.\nWhen Ghelryn fashioned fine suits of ceremonial armor for King Morinn and Queen Tithmel of Citadel Felbarr, they awarded him an honorary title as Royal Armorer. This strengthened the already strong reputation of Foehammers Forge."
