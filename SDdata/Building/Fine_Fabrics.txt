Fine Fabrics was a clothier shop in the Upper City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
Fine Fabrics did business with the Upper City patriars and city governors, outfitting them with quality finery. The shops services were available in exchange for coin or letters of credit.
In the , Gerard Densim, the proprietor of Fine Fabrics, did business with the Guild, paid for the organizations thugs to stand guard over the shop, protecting it from the dreaded Stone Lord, a new kingpin allied with the Cult of the Absolute. As the guild war grew more severe, The Guild Bursar Uktar raised the protection tithes. If unpaid, the guard would be withdrawn from Fine Fabrics. Gerard wrote a politely pleading letter stating he could not afford the guard to be removed and asked if it would be a good compromise for the Guild to accept a letter of credit from Fine Fabrics in addition to a twenty-percent discount for the Guilds guard (so they could look presentable while standing guard) and a fifty-percent discount to the guildmaster Nine-Fingers Keene, the citys fifth and unforgotten duke.
