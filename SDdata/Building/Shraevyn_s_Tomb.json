Any attempts to speak to or interact with this illusion would be for naught. This casket was where Shraevyn kept ''Sword of the Dales'', the last weapon he crafted before his death.",
        "History": "Sometime around [[1369 DR]], [[Randal Morn]] learned the tomb of Shraevyn had been discovered and led an excursion with some of the [[Freedom Riders]]. They successfully navigated the tomb, despite losing some in a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[ethereal plane]], and briefly retrieved the famously powerful ''Sword of the Dales''.\n\nAs Randal and his men exited the crypt, they were ambushed by a group of [[Zhentarim]], whom they fought off after an extended battle. The Freedom Riders were attacked again however, and most, including Randal, disappeared. Only one Dalesman, [[Atrion]], survived. He proceeded to seek the help of the Sage of Shadowdale, [[Elminster]], at [[Elminster's Tower|his tower]] but found only the scribe [[Lhaeo]]. The latter began to round up adventurers to investigate both the location of the sword and the fate of Randal and the remaining Riders.\n\nThe group's disappearance was caused by [[Gothyl]], an ancient arch-[[shadow]] whose essence was bound to the Sword. After abducting Randal, she killed and turned his men into [[skeleton]]s and left them in the tomb, using the ''Sword of the Dales'' as bait to draw more powerful prospective puppets.",
        "Layout": {
            "Entrance": "The entrance to the tomb was carved into the rock of the Desertsmouths. [[Granite]] steps led to large metal door that was embossed with [[magic]] [[Rune magic|rune]]s, which were embedded in the mountainside. Both sides of the door were flanked with 20-foot stone statues. The left statue depicted an [[elven]] female, dressed in flowing robes, but had been partially destroyed by avalanches and rock slides. The figure on the right depicted a helmed warrior in [[plate mail]], its right arm raised and holding a massive [[lucerne hammer]]. The elven statue represented the beauty of and respect for a [[wizard]] Shraevyn met in his travels to the [[Astral Plane]]; she showed him a great deal about magic, that otherwise would have taken him years to learn alone. There was a hidden entrance behind this statue, rigged with a ''[[fire trap]]'', that led into the tomb. The warrior statue paid homage to the brave and noble [[knight]]s and [[fighter]]s for which he had made weapons over the years.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| source = The riddle of Shraevyn's Tomb.\n| text   = Friends to the end! they once exclaimed,<br/>\nBoasting of evil they once tamed.<br/>\nNow they gaze in hate, friend now foe,<br/>\nBut hearts defy what minds now know.<br/>\nMagic against steel,<br/>\nFate of a cruel deal,<br/>\nA mirrored haze of friendships concealed.<br/>\n\nWarrior's heart and wizard's soul,<br/>\nBoth fighting for the same goal.<br/>\nMagic against steel,<br/>\nFate of a cruel deal,<br/>\nA mirrored view of the end of the road.<br/>\n\nThe sheath called for its sword,<br/>\nWizardly energy withdrew to where it was stored.<br/>\nTogether they gazed at the mighty door,<br/>\nAnd their fury for one another<br/>\nburned no more.<br/>\nNow honor-bound and steadfast,<br/>\nAn oath sword to last.<br/>\nThe bond of friendship reborn.}}\nIn the passageway through the trapped secret entrance was a brass plaque reading \"''Hope you enjoyed the show!''\". When the main entrance was opened, the runes of the door glowed with blue fire and a voice emanating from it would pose a riddle to those inside.\n\nVisitors to the vault were expected to respond with the ideal that the warrior and wizard remembered to stop from attacking one another. The satisfactory answer was a response that conveyed the ''unity of an adventuring party.'' Failure to express this concept caused the voice to express its disappointment and no longer speak to anyone inside the tomb.",
            "Warrior Hall": "A 60-foot-long (18 meters), 10-foot-tall (3 meters), magically illuminated hallway led to the main chamber of the tomb. This light came from glowing red orbs that were suspended in air above head-height. Either side of this corridor had a mosaic tile mural, each depicting a mounted king, wielding the sword ''[[Giventhar]]'', commanding his army in battle against foes made of shadows. The difference between the two was one mural was dark and murky, nearly colorless, with the only bright spots being the emerald green glow of ''Giventhar'', while the other was lighter, almost iridescent, with the figure of the king appearing vivacious.\n\nIn the side of the hall was a small chamber, hidden behind a secret door and trapped with ''sleep gas'' and containing [[spider skeleton]]s. In this room was an [[oak]] desk with a intricate vine-shaped carving; in one of the drawers was a scroll tube made of bone that contained scrolls of ''[[animal friendship]]'', ''[[magical stone]]'', and ''[[heat metal]]''. Along the walls were several bookcases that contained a wide variety of tomes and manuals along with a few select, rare titlesâ€”''[[The Art of Weaponcrafting]]'' and ''[[Metal Spellweaving]]''.",
            "Main Chamber": {
                "Illusion": ":When someone attempted to move this jar, it would seem to disappear. It remained in the same place, but couldn't be seen as if it had ''[[invisibility]]'' cast upon it.",
                "Wild magic|Wild": ":When handled, this jar would open and let loose a blast of golden energy that would fly around the room, strike all the other pots then return inside. Then one of three effects took place. Either a small dark cloud would form over the person who touched the pot and rain down upon them, a stunning bouquet of flowers would begin to grow out of someone's shoes, or a ''[[chime of opening]]'' spell would be cast, unfastening and untying all the belongings of anyone nearby. This was one of the unneeded jars.",
                "Divination": ":The lid of this jar would shimmer and show a view of the area outside of Shraevyn's tomb. This was not a current image as if from a ''[[scrying]]'' spell but more of a \"live painting\".",
                "Enchantment": ":The surface of the golden jar would display a projection of the ''Sword of the Dales'' in its present condition.",
                "Elemental": ":The lid to this container was missing and it was about a third full of dark, damp soil. Deep in this dirt was a small, magical fire that burned without fuel or aid. This was the second extraneous jar.",
                "Conjuration": ":In place of a jar, an ancient tome sat in one alcove, entitled ''[[Shraevyn's Guide to Magical Mastery]]''. If the book was opened, it would always open to the same two pages, on which had been placed a ''[[sepia snake sigil]]''. Once someone began to read from the book, the sigil would activate, the reader would be immobilized, and the book would transform into a matching golden pot to be used in the room's puzzle.",
                "Necromancy": ":This jar had no magical effect, but rather an eerily realistic carving of a [[humanoid]] [[skeleton]] wearing a cracked helm and wielding a rusty sword.",
                "Alteration": ":When lifted, this jar would change into a lopsided, earth-colored clay pot that was much heavier than its original form. After a few moments it would transform again into a sleek, silver that was lighter than its first form. Finally it returned to its original appearance.",
                "[[Abjuration]]": ":The front of this jar had the picture of a shield with an emblem of fire inside it. When examined the shield would glow and the fire would appear to blaze",
                "[[Invocation]]": ":Blue-white electricity raced up the outside of this jar and it would momentarily shock anyone who touched its surface, leaving their fingers numb but undamaged.\n\nIf the eight jars were placed in their correct positions on the painting of the sun on the floor, the silver door to the next section of the tomb would open. If any of them were in the wrong order when the eighth jar was put in place a [[dust devil]], a [[fire snake]], and a [[sandling]] would appear in the middle of the room and attack anyone inside.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = \n| source = The inscription on the amulet on the statue of Tymora.\n| text   = Turn right or left, front or back,<br/>\nThere's no saving you from your own stare.<br/>\nWhether gold be piled by bar or by sack,<br/>\nThere's seldom enough change to spare.}}"
            },
            "Rear Hallway": "The area beyond the silver door was a T-intersection that shone with a bright, silver light. In the middle of the intersection was an alcove containing a shrine holding a marble statue. This was a depiction of [[Tymora]], as a young, gleeful woman clad in [[leather armor]] and carrying a pair of [[short sword]]s. Around her neck was hung an amulet, a silver chain with a metal disc that depicted her [[holy symbol]]. It carried an inscription on the reverse.\n\n<br/>",
            "Treasure Room": "{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| source = The final inscription.\n| text   = An adventurer's story never ends,<br/>\nIt goes on and on, over and again.<br/>\nBut past death's door and beyond each bend,<br/>\nare those who will take your every win.<br/>\n\nTo those I cry, begone and flee!<br/>\nPlunder another's resting place.<br/>\nBetter yet, turn to yourself and see<br/>\nThat evil smile upon your face.<br/>\n\nMy treasures are gone, there's none to take,<br/>\nI've cast them out into [[Sigil]],<br/>\nInto [[Karten]]'s hands for my own sake,<br/>\nAllowing others to stand vigil.<br/>\n\nGood luck my friends, turn tail and run,<br/>\nbe warmed beneath the bright sun,<br/>\nFor knowing me is no guarantee<br/>\nof peace or even security.}}\nThe pathway to the right led to a sort of treasure room, filled with several empty chests and coffers.",
