They held up for many years, holding up to mud and water rather well.\nSome pre-made footwear included boots and slippers, but their most famous and sought after item were thigh-high, sleek, pointed-toed boots for women. These cost a steep price of 10 gold pieces and had a waiting period of at least nine days.\nBy 1363 DR, the building of this store was considered to be quite old.\nThentavvas Boots was among some of the more notable and recognizable stores in the Trades Ward.
