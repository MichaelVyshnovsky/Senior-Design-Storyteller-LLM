Udlaras Camel Emporium was a camel-selling and rental business owned by Udlara Thaerintauhn in the 14 century DR.
Udlaras Emporium was across the bazaar in the Bitter Well oasis.
The tent appeared rather worn down, but it was actually an enchanted tent, called Udlaras tent.
The interior was actually clean, spacious, and well-lit.
Udlara sold camels and camel-related services. Depending on their opinion of the buyer, the asking price for a camel could go from 45 to 80 gp.
The magical properties of the tent made it difficult to damage without using magical weapons even those had to be stronger than the bare minimum in order to deal damage.
Udlaras Camel Emporium had made arrangements with Cormyr to supply some of their adventurers with camels and guides, but Udlara renegotiated with the agents as they arrived.
