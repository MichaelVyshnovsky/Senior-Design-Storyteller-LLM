During the raid they killed the son of [[Cromm|Baron Cromm]]. The baron marched into the Lizard Marsh seeking revenge, but was ultimately slain.\n\nAround [[1485 DR]], the black dragon [[Sjachmalsvir]] attacked Cromm's Hold and demanded the [[Water Key]] hidden in the hold's dungeons.\n\nSometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], Baroness Cromm conspired with the [[succubus]] [[Pencheska]] to usurp the Duchess of [[Daggerford]], Lady [[Morwen Daggerford]], and eventually take the Duchess' place. To this end, she kept the Duchess imprisoned within her keep."
