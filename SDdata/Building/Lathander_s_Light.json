In the wake of the conflagration, a magical [[torc]] that radiated light, and supposedly able to ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' areas of magical ''[[darkness]]'',  went missing from the temple.\n\nAt some point in [[1369 DR]], after [[Randal Morn]] reclaimed Dagger Falls, the temple was rebuilt and began attracting priests of [[Lathander]] from around the [[Inner Sea]] under the stewardship of [[Harndarr Oryn]].\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the priests of Lathander's Light determined through [[divination]] magic that the missing torc may have been near [[Eagles' Eyrie]]. However, due to the delicate politics surrounding the [[Clan Brightblade|Brightblade]] dwarves and the folk of Dagger Falls, [[Randal Morn]] only suggested the job to those he or the [[Church of Lathander]] considered trustworthy.\n\nDespite the revelation that Lathander was actually [[Amaunator]] in [[1385 DR]], the temple kept its traditional name.{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|3}}\n\nBy [[1480 DR]], [[Dareen Travaskyr]] had become the ranking priestess of the temple and used her notoriety and the temple's riches to recruit adventurers throughout the dale.",
