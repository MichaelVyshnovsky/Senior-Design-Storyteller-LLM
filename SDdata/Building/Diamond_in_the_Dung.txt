The Diamond in the Dung was a large inn located in Hillsfar that catered to adventurers despite the fact that this was considered an illegal activity.
The inn was located in the eastern section of the city near the main gate, allowing tired adventurers to easily spot it upon entering the city.
A stay at the inn cost 8 gp and that price included a room and meal. The inns owner was willing to allow patrons to trade equipment for their stay as well.
The Diamond in the Dung was owned by Oswul Farnf in 1367 DR.
