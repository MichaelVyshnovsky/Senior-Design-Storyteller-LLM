        "mainbody": "The '''Citadel of the Bloody Hand''' was a notorious stronghold hidden high inside [[Mount Waterdeep]] and considered part of the upper [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]].{{Cite dragon/211/\"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay\"|30}} Some insisted it should be called the '''Citadel of the Black Hand'''.",
        "History": "The Citadel of the Bloody Hand was first developed in the {{YearlinkName|1262}} as a base of operations for a local [[thieves' guild]]â€”either the [[Shadow Thieves]]<ref> or the [[Thieves' Guild of Waterdeep]]. The thieves managed to secure the area against Undermountain's monsters and defended it with many traps, and named it for their guildmaster.\n\nHowever, the thieves' guild was later run out of Waterdeep. The fate of their base afterward was unknown; it might've been abandoned, seized by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], or infested again by monsters.\n\nHowever, by the 1360s [[DR]], part of the Citadel of the Bloody Hand had been taken over by the [[Harpers]] and made part of [[Harpers' Hold]].",
        "Defenses": "The Citadel of the Bloody Hand contained many lethal traps and wards left by the Shadow Thieves; some were repurposed to defend a passageway to Harpers' Hold. The area of Undermountain around it was also rife with traps and guardian creatures, as well as spy-holes and secret passages.\n\nUnder the City Guard, the Citadel was occupied by some 46 Guardsmen and a number of [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s."
