The '''Temple of Loviatar''' was a chapel on [[Dragonisle]], within the [[Citadel of Immurk's Hold|Citadel]] of [[Immurk's Hold]], dedicated to the worship of [[Loviatar]].

==Location==
This chapel was located on the mid-level of the Citadel, next to the mess hall and across from the living quarters where its [[priest]]s rested.{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|53-54}}

==Interior==
Within the chapel was a dais that held [[brazier]]s, a [[bronze]] statue of Loviatar, [[whip]]s, and other instruments of pain. This statue had a minor [[enchantment]] upon it that would cause pain to any non-[[evil]] creature that touched it and temporarily paralyze the body part that made contact with it.{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|54}}

==Activities==
Besides being a place of worship, the Temple of Loviatar was where troops in the garrison faced punishment while off-duty for being disobedient and unruly not. This did not occur often, as most in the Citadel tried their best to follow the rules. Those who most often fell victim to this were the Citadel's dim-witted [[ogre]]s.

Beyond those garrisoned within the Citadel, some citizens of Immurk's Hold could face punishment at the hands of the Loviatan priests. For example, if one were to use [[magic]] that made them [[invisibility|invisible]], changed their appearance, changed their [[gender and sex|sex]], etc. &mdash; but managed to convince the [[Captain's Council]] that it was for a piratical purpose &mdash; then the offender would face twenty lashes in the Temple of Loviatar instead of execution.{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|45}}

==History==
This chapel was erected sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by [[Pencilo Windrag]], a devoted worshiper of Loviatar and the Harbormaster of Immurk's Hold.

==Inhabitants==
The chapel was managed by two [[specialty priest]]esses, [[Enolive]] and [[Mensarea]].

==Reputation==
The chapel did not see active worship among those garrisoned in the Citadel, with only ten percent of those inside actually engaging in worship.
