The Temple of Loviatar was a chapel on Dragonisle, within the Citadel of Immurks Hold, dedicated to the worship of Loviatar.
This chapel was located on the mid-level of the Citadel, next to the mess hall and across from the living quarters where its priests rested.
Within the chapel was a dais that held braziers, a bronze statue of Loviatar, whips, and other instruments of pain. This statue had a minor enchantment upon it that would cause pain to any non-evil creature that touched it and temporarily paralyze the body part that made contact with it.
Besides being a place of worship, the Temple of Loviatar was where troops in the garrison faced punishment while off-duty for being disobedient and unruly not. This did not occur often, as most in the Citadel tried their best to follow the rules. Those who most often fell victim to this were the Citadels dim-witted ogres.
Beyond those garrisoned within the Citadel, some citizens of Immurks Hold could face punishment at the hands of the Loviatan priests. For example, if one were to use magic that made them invisible, changed their appearance, changed their sex, etc. &mdash but managed to convince the Captains Council that it was for a piratical purpose &mdash then the offender would face twenty lashes in the Temple of Loviatar instead of execution.
This chapel was erected sometime in the 14 century DR by Pencilo Windrag, a devoted worshiper of Loviatar and the Harbormaster of Immurks Hold.
The chapel was managed by two specialty priestesses, Enolive and Mensarea.
The chapel did not see active worship among those garrisoned in the Citadel, with only ten percent of those inside actually engaging in worship.
