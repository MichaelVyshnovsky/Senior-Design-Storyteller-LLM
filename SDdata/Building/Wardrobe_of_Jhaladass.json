        "mainbody": "he Wardrobe of Jhaladass was the name given to a mysterious cellar that was all that remained of a mages tower in Alaghôn in Turmish.\nAlthough buried underground, the chambers outer wall could still be reached by entering the cellars of certain other, not-well-known buildings, then passing through some crawlspaces and sewers.\nWhat was exposed was a curved wall constructed of an ominous dark stone inscribed with runes, but no entrance.\nWhile the aboveground magics of the tower had failed, the belowground magics remained incredibly potent yet unpredictable. This unknown warding enchantment would, when so much as touched or targeted with other magic, trigger a random deadly spell at the would-be intruders outside. Known spells were cloudkill, reverse gravity (hurling people up at the ceiling then down at the ground six times), Bigbys clenched fist (attacking one intruder after another), cone of cold (engulfing the whole excavated space), blade barrier, fireball, lightning bolt, ice storm, death fog, and meteor swarm (eight spheres that hurtled in both directions around the walls circumference and rebounded without losing speed). Attempts to bypass or break through the wall or its wards with dig, passwall, or dispel magic had the same results, while prismatic spells were reflected upon their casters. The defenses continued underneath the chamber, as one determined digger discovered.\nLong dead by the mid–14 century DR, the mage Jhaladass once owned a round tower in Alaghôn, but its aboveground parts were later looted and its magic deteriorated. Finally, it fell down and another building was erected on the site. All that remained as of around 1360 DR was its circular base and well-warded cellar.\nOver the years, explorers located the cellar and excavated a ring around it and even beneath it while trying to find a door or break in, perhaps hoping to find treasure inside. None succeeded."
