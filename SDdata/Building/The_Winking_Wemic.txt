'''The Winking Wemic''' was a [[gnome]]-run festhall in [[Skultan]], [[Sembia]], that was in existence in [[1368 DR]].

It was staffed by attractive [[human]] females, and was home to underhanded dealings. A rumor existed that [[Purple Dragons]] would permit these dealings to continue, accepting bribes in the form of discounted "services."{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}
