Arrowpoint was the headquarters for the Pegasus Archery Company, a mercenary group that operated out of High Dale in the 1300s DR.
Due to the remote location, and abundant training grounds of the holding, they were able to provide quality protection to their patrons, as well great experience to their members, albeit with relatively low pay. They would support the local militia, under the High Constable, in their protection of the dale.
This military hold consisted of several barracks and stables, all protected by a semi-circular earthwork, located just outside the village of Highcastle. The barracks housed the 75 mounted archers, who unlike the Flying Auxiliary, would only ride horses and not pegasi.
