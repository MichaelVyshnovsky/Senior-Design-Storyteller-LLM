Inquiries were often met with ridicule and scorn. Persistent buyers with ready coin would eventually be escorted to his \"compounding room\" where a vast array of spell components were available for double the prices found in other countries.\nCategoryShops\nCategoryApothecary shops\nCategorySpice shops\nCategoryMagic shops\nCategoryArcana shops\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryLocations in Eshpurta\nCategoryLocations in Amn\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\ncu21p01n87bow7jabv38mde3lj587mj"
