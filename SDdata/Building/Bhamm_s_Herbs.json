        "Services": "The [[arcane]] arts were frowned upon in Amn and Eudhis would deny he had anything in stock (other than [[herb]]s) that could be considered a spell component. Inquiries were often met with ridicule and scorn. Persistent buyers with ready coin would eventually be escorted to his \"compounding room\" where a vast array of spell components were available for double the prices found in other countries.",
