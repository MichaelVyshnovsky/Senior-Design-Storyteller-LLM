        "Structure": "Shatterblade’s was a one-story festhall of fair condition.",
        "Interior": "The decor was both gaudy and vibrant, with the main taproom featuring three chandeliers—perfect for the occasional swashbuckling display.",
        "Services": "The food and drink at Shatterblade's was of good quality, though patrons were advised to be prepared for the possibility of a brawl, given the rowdy clientele. Prices were high, reflecting the quality of the offerings. The festhall also offered the company of [[prostitute|professional escorts]], and its staff, seasoned by experience, quickly learned to anticipate impending conflicts and discreetly retreat to private rooms as tensions rose.",
        "Inhabitants": "Shatterblade's was owned by [[Rhaunaguth]], a former [[buccaneer]] and [[mercenary]] leader. Named for the [[mithral]] [[shield]] that Rhaunaguth famously wields in battle, the establishment was primarily a meeting place for his sellsword associates. At any given time, a minimum of ten of Rhaunaguth's mercenaries could be found here. These [[chainmail]]-clad fighters were armed with [[long sword]]s, light [[crossbow]]s, and [[dagger]]s."
