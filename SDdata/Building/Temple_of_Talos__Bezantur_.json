        "mainbody": "he Temple of Talos was a place of worship dedicated to Talos, the god of destruction, located in Bezantur, Thay, as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was one of only a few permanent Talassan temples.\nThis temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the House of Cyric to the west, the Temple of Beshaba to the north, the Temple of Kossuth to the east, and the Temple of Bane to the south.\nThe building itself was one of the smaller temples in the city, and was little more than a large granite cube topped with a low white dome.\nThe temple preached of the destruction that Talos would one day bring about. The congregation was often blamed whenever disasters such as fires occurred around Bezantur.\nAs with most of the Gods of Fury, Talos worship was not popular in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR. At some point, followers of Talos forcibly drove the worshipers of another religion from this temple, and then adopted it as their own.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the congregation was led by High Priest Nofallis. While the people of Bezantur were suspicious of the temple whenever a disaster befell the city, they had yet to accuse or harass the congregation over these allegations as of the late 1360s DR."
