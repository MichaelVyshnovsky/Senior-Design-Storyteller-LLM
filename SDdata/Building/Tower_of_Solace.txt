The '''Tower of Solace''', later known as the '''Plague Tower''', was a grand tower found in the city of [[Neverwinter]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=D&D.N">{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter}}

{{Quote|We're not as we were, but we're still together|Inscription on the statues of ''the Maiden'', ''the Mother'', and ''the Crone''.}}

==Location==
The tower was located in [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Protector's Enclave]], across the bridge southeast of [[Castle Never]].<ref name=D&D.N" />

==Structure==
The tower was circular in its form, with a semi-circular outer hallway surrounding a central, columnar chamber. The double doors of the tower's main entrance were situated atop a small square staircase, opening up to the second level of its interior.<ref name=D&D.N" />

Beneath the tower itself was a series of cavernous passageways, used primarily for storage.<ref name=D&D.N" />

==Interior==

Entering the tower at the second level opened up to the semicircular outer hallway, within which was a circular chamber that extended up throughout the entirety of the tower to its topmost floor. Within this central room was a grand, spiraling double staircase that wound its way to the tower's numerous floors. The double stairs encircled a massive statue of what appeared to be an [[elven]] woman with feathered wings and the body of a serpent.<ref name=D&D.N" />

A common artistic theme found throughout the tower was a series of stone statues referred to as ''the Maiden'', ''the Mother'', and ''the Crone''. Each of these were female figures of varying ages, carrying a flower, a cornucopia, and a staff respectively. Each statue at each location could be adjusted atop its dais to face the four cardinal directions.<ref name=D&D.N" />

Lining up the three statues to the correct direction would open a nearby passageway in the tower.<ref name=D&D.N" />

===Atmosphere===
The tower had spacious and austere architecture, with grand hallways that were lined with stone columns and inner gates of fine craftsmanship. The walls were decorated with a number of great tapestries and the top floor even featured windows of stained glass. The interior of the tower possessed a certain feeling of refinement and austerity.<ref name=D&D.N" />

==Activities==
While the original resident of the tower was unknown, it had been repurposed as a [[mage]] tower by the malevolent spellcaster [[Rhazzad]]. Transforming it into what came to be known as the "Plague Tower", the [[elven]] wizard conducted experiments on the [[plaguechanged]] residents of [[Neverwinter]].<ref name=D&D.N" />

==History==
Sometime during or before the 1470s [[DR]], the mage Rhazzad traveled to the [[Chasm]] found in the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] and encountered several beings he referred to as the "Masters". Rhazzad sought to emulate their work and transform himself using the residual energy leftover from the [[Spellplague]] of the century before, and attain power such as they possessed.<ref name=D&D.N" />

In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the secrets of Rhazzad's work was uncovered by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], working for the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. In a final desperate move, Rhazzad abducted [[Dorothea Linkletter]] and fled to his tower, drawing the ire of Dorothea's husband [[Josef Linkletter]], the adventurer, and their fellow members of the Neverwinter Guard.<ref name=D&D.N" />

While [[Sergeant Knox]] held the front entrance of the tower with [[Hawthidon Faalwun]], [[Dell McCourt]], and the Fargo sisters [[Abbey Fargo|Abbey]] and [[Zoey Fargo|Zoey]], Josef raced into the tower in search of his wife. The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge followed suit and found the couple safe just moments before Rhazzad appeared. The wizard transformed the guardsman into a kind of plaguechanged monstrosity and set him loose against his friend. The two fought a savage battle that collapsed a part of the tower's ground floor, but the hero emerged victorious and subdued the regretful Josef in time to learn about Rhazzad's whereabouts.<ref name=D&D.N" />

Rhazzad retreated to the top floor of the Tower of Solace, in an attempt to complete his [[ritual]] that would "give him power over the [[Spellplague]]." While the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was unable to stop Rhazzad's own transformation into an abomination, they did slay the wizard and prevent them from further threatening Neverwinter and its citizens.<ref name=D&D.N" />
