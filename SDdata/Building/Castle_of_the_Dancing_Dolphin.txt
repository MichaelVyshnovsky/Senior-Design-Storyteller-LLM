The '''Castle of the Dancing Dolphin''' was an underwater temple dedicated to [[Istishia]].

==Description==
This castle was the holiest of Istishian temples, and its actual name was unknown. The Castle of the Dancing Dolphin was named so due to the dolphins that covered the [[Delphine Regent]]'s coat-of-arms.

==Location==
The location of the fortress was unknown except that it was somewhere within the [[Trackless Sea]].

==Inhabitants==
The Delphine Regent, [[Aquaril Sethanilar]], was known to live in the Castle of the Dancing Dolphin. The Regent lived within with great secrecy, but was not the temple's only inhabitant. Many aquatic creatures of different varieties protected the leader of the Istishian faith.
