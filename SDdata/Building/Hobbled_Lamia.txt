The Hobbled Lamia was a festhall in the Lower Port of Skullport.
The Hobbled Lamia was a two-story establishment in poor condition.
The interior decor was an eclectic array of salvaged materials, including tarnished brass cherub statues, decaying red carpets, and garish tapestries depicting lurid scenes.
The Hobbled Lamia was considered one of Skullportâ€™s most disreputable establishments. Despite its rundown appearance, the venue attracted a steady clientele of sailors, laborers, humanoids, and patrons who prioritized affordability over ambiance. While the decor and atmosphere was undeniably grim, the festhall was rarely empty. All patrons were welcome as long as they had coin to spend and treated the staff with respect.
The Hobbled Lamias wine selection wass surprisingly excellent, though expensive, with a single goblet of the house vintage priced at 5 gold pieces. The festhall also provided the company of escorts for an additional fee. Twice each night, the venue hosted mud-wrestling matches featuring participants of various species and genders. Betting on these matches was obligatory, with a minimum wager of 5 copper pieces.
The Hobbled Lamia was owned by Alysae, a robust woman in her mid-forties, and a priestess of Shar. Her origin was uncertain due to a hard-to-place accent, but many believed her to be from the east.
