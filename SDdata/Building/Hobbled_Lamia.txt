The '''Hobbled Lamia''' was a [[festhall]] in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]].

==Structure==
The Hobbled Lamia was a two-story establishment in poor condition.

==Interior==
The interior decor was an eclectic array of salvaged materials, including tarnished [[brass]] cherub statues, decaying red carpets, and garish [[tapestries]] depicting lurid scenes.

==Services==
The Hobbled Lamia was considered one of Skullportâ€™s most disreputable establishments. Despite its rundown appearance, the venue attracted a steady clientele of sailors, laborers, [[humanoid]]s, and patrons who prioritized affordability over ambiance. While the decor and atmosphere was undeniably grim, the festhall was rarely empty. All patrons were welcome as long as they had [[currency|coin]] to spend and treated the staff with respect.

The Hobbled Lamia's [[wine]] selection wass surprisingly excellent, though expensive, with a single [[goblet]] of the house vintage priced at 5 [[gold pieces]]. The festhall also provided the company of [[prostitute|escorts]] for an additional fee. Twice each night, the venue hosted mud-wrestling matches featuring participants of various species and [[gender and sex|genders]]. Betting on these matches was obligatory, with a minimum wager of 5 [[copper piece]]s.

==Inhabitants==
The Hobbled Lamia was owned by [[Alysae]], a robust woman in her mid-forties, and a priestess of [[Shar]]. Her origin was uncertain due to a hard-to-place accent, but many believed her to be from the east.
