        "mainbody": "uroras Realms Shop, Street of Tusks Catalogue Counter was an outlet of the Auroras Emporium retail chain in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep in the mid–14 century DR. It was one of six such outlets in the city.On page 120 the sourcebook Volos Guide to Waterdeep, the Trades Ward catalogue counter is given the name \"High Road.\" Since both City of Splendors and City of Splendors Waterdeep list that as the name of the North Ward catalogue counter, this can be considered an error. Therefore, all information given on page 120 can be considered relevant to this store instead.\nThis shop was situated on the northwest corner of the intersection of High Road and the Street of the Tusks.\nThis shop sold the various items found in Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.\nIt also sold a variety magic items, with expected delivery times of 10–30 days.\nIn the mid-1360s DR, Orgula Samshroon worked here as a counter clerk and Dhaunryl Zalimbar as a service-mage. In addition, there were six guards who worked shifts of three and three."
