        "mainbody": "arlsmere was a favored summer home of the royal Tethyrean Royal Family that stood in the Dragons Head Peninsula region of the Tethyr Peninsula, but was abandoned by the 14 century DR.\nCarlsmere was just one of many abandoned and ruined noble estates found on The Bite area of the Dragons Head, on the shores of the Dragons Teeth Lagoon. The manor stood directly to the south of the Dragondown Rise Ruins on the Firedrake Road that stretched along the entire peninsula. Tharamon Ruins and Presmer Ruins were the next stops along the Firedrake Road moving west, eventually reaching the city of Velen while the road bent along the shoreline to the east, eventually reaching Tulmene.\nThe abandoned manors grounds held apple trees, overgrown herb garden, and tangled trees and shrubbery.\nthumb|Carlsmere on 345x345px\nThe main manor was separated from the Firedrake Road by a four-spired gatehouse. By the late 14 century DR, its massive arched iron gates were in disrepair one collapsed to the ground while the other was hanging off one hinge making unnerving metallic screeching in the wind. The manor was once defended by a guard-spell which was also failing, manifesting as a fully-armored guard whose feet faded away before reaching the ground. The magical sentry performed no actions apart from reflecting spells back at those who unwittingly cast them.\nThe main structure stood on a ridge under a canopy of massive trees. The low building was of admirable size. It had four short towers on the corners of the manor and a slated roof. Several outlying buildings could be found in Carlsmere, including stables, a collapsed coach shed, smaller homes of the manors servants, and an old nursery and childrens playhouse.\nCarlsmere was most known for the event that took place during a dire storm more than 200 hundred years before the , when Prince Valys did an unspeakable thing under cover of the night. Valys smothered his older brother, Prince Priam, along with his niece and nephew, Rising Prince Vyshan and Rising Princess Majal. Prince Valys ensured the crown was to be passed on to him from his great-grandfather Alemander I. However, that was never to be, as he was slain by his younger brother Coram III, a ranger who used his skills to track down the murder and avenge the fallen family members. After a duel, Coram III dismembered his murderous brother and burned his body in Carlsmeres courtyard. After this grim event, the future king ordered Carlsmere abandoned.\nEven though many opportunistic treasure seekers thought the Carlsmere hid some things of value, due to the magical sentry at the gates, they failed to report finding anything as of the late 14 century DR. At least nothing that was revealed to others.\nOver the years, the manor and its smaller servants quarters served as brigand and monster lairs, however, none stayed in the ruins for long thanks to a ghost infestation. In the centuries that followed, those who ventured into Carlsmere reported ghostly sounds of weeping children, apparitions wandering the halls, and translucent figures playing in the nursery. Priams poltergeist was said to haunt the mansions upper floors, forever cursed with rage over the death of his children and inability to find revenge. Some individuals who spent the night in the wrong room within Carlsmere were found dead, smothered in their sleep."
