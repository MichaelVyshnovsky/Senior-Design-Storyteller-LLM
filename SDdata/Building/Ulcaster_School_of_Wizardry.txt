}}
The '''Ulcaster School of Wizardry''' (also seen as '''Ulcaster's School of Conjuration''') was a [[magic]]al academy founded on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid–11{{th}} century [[DR]],

As its name suggested, the school was founded by the accomplished [[conjurer]] [[Ulcaster]].

==Location==
The school was located on a hill east of [[Beregost]].

==Interior==
The passageways beneath the school were narrow and almost maze-like in their layout.

==Services==
As was appropriate to the specialization of its founder, the school focused on specific studies of magic: [[conjuration]] and [[summoning]].

==History==
After it was founded, the Ulcaster School of Wizardry found great success. It attracted prospective students and other practitioners of [[magic]] from all across the [[Sword Coast]].

Unfortunately, a group of [[Calishite]] [[mage]]s believed the school would grow to be too powerful. They assaulted the school some 80 years after its founding. The school was left a smoldering ruin and Ulcaster himself was never heard from again.

In fact Ulcaster died, and his spirit continued to haunt the ruins of his school for hundreds of years. In order to find peace, he sought to recover some of knowledge that was believed to have been lost deep beneath the school.

Throughout the years, some [[adventurer]]s ventured to and died within the ruins of Ulcaster school.

==Rumors & Legends==
As of the mid–14{{th}} century, local rumors spoke of magic-casting spirits that still dwelled within the ruins of the old school.

==Inhabitants==
The ruins of the school were infested with a number of horrific creatures including slimes such as [[mustard jelly|mustard]] and [[ochre jellies]], [[giant spider]]s, and [[undead]] [[dread wolves]].
