        "mainbody": "The Captains Court was the main government building in Luskan.\nThe palace was located one block ahead of the south wall of Luskan, specifically on Aldevers Street, opposite the Hall of Warriors.\nSeveral offices and assembly chambers were housed within the Captains Court, not only for the High Captains of Luskan, but for their assistants as well.\nThe High Captains governed Luskan from within here. As such, all laws (after approval by the mages of the Host Tower of the Arcane) were pronounced here.\nSets of guards and officers protected the hall from any intruders. At least thirty members of Luskans militia guarded this single building, in and out. During assemblies of the High Captains, around a hundred soldiers could be on guard."
