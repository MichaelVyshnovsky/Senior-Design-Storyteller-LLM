        "mainbody": "Manor Atheon was a famous haunted villa that once belonged to the noble Atheon family of Tethyr and stood on the Bite of the Dragons Head Peninsula.\nManor Atheon was one of many abandoned and ruined noble estates found on the Bite, along the shores of the Dragons Teeth Lagoon. The villa stood where the Firedrake Road reached Cape Velen and bent northwards along Asavirs Channel. The villa neighbored Dargree Ruins to the east.\nThe manor was once inhabited by Lord Sarnil Atheon. The nobleman famously went mad after a mysterious sea fog shrouded the villa for five days straight. Driven insane, Sarnil used the Atheon ancestral greatsword to slaughter his entire family. Since then, Manor Atheon was left unoccupied. On occasion, the strange fog returned and hung over the villa. Mad Sarnil Atheons howls were heard echoing from the fog as ghosts of his wife and children could be seen eternally fleeing from their murderer. Each fog caused the scene of grisly murder to repeat itself as the ghosts fled across the villas halls, dripping blood along the way."
