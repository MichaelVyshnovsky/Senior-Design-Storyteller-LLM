        "Location": "Manor Atheon was one of many abandoned and ruined noble estates found on the Bite, along the shores of the [[Dragon's Teeth Lagoon]]. The villa stood where the [[Firedrake Road]] reached [[Cape Velen]] and bent northwards along [[Asavir's Channel]]. The villa neighbored [[Dargree Ruins]] to the east.",
        "History": "The manor was once inhabited by Lord [[Sarnil Atheon]]. The nobleman famously went mad after a mysterious sea fog shrouded the villa for five days straight. Driven insane, Sarnil used the Atheon ancestral [[greatsword]] to slaughter his entire family. Since then, Manor Atheon was left unoccupied. On occasion, the strange fog returned and hung over the villa. Mad Sarnil Atheon's howls were heard echoing from the fog as ghosts of his wife and children could be seen eternally fleeing from their murderer. Each fog caused the scene of grisly murder to repeat itself as the ghosts fled across the villa's halls, dripping blood along the way."
