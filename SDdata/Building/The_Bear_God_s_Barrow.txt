'''The Bear God's Barrow''' was a cavern within a barrow mound in [[Rashemen]], guarded by [[telthor]] and [[elemental|elementals]], about one day's travel on foot from the [[Mulsantir]] city gates. The [[bear]] [[god]] [[Okku]] kept a watch over the place. The [[Kalach-Cha]] was bound here when [[Safiya]] found him.

==Imaskari Workshop==
An ancient underground [[Imaskar]]i workshop was connected to the underground. It may have been found by Safiyah and the Kalach-Cha. According to Safiya, the ruin was no doubt Imaskari in origin, and the hill was a city in ages past; the area must've been uncovered by accident by the earth tremors from stirring spirits when she broke out the Kalach-Cha. [[Helmed horror]]s kept watch over the workshop, accompanied by a few animated weapons. An incomplete Imaskari [[golem]], which Safiya dated as from the late [[Quyun]] dynasty, lay amongst the ruins. Safiya knew how to animate it, though she did not have a way of getting it to stay animated beyond the barrow.

Besides a smattering of scrolls, notable treasures in the workshop included a [[Mage protector]], a [[Breastplate of Hidden Imaskar]], and an [[Imaskari rod]].
