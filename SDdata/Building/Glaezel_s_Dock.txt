Glaezels Dock was a small wharf of the western side of the Gray Harbor in Baldurs Gate, owned by the Glaezel family of some prominence in the 14 century DR.
Glaezels Dock stood at the end of Black Eel Street that crossed the Seatower district from the western city walls to the waters of the Gray Harbor. It was located between the Seatower of Balduran and the larger northern wharf â€“ Hethkantles Jetty. Sornbanner Street ran perpendicular to Glaezels Dock, one city block away from the water.
By the late 14 century DR, Glaezels Dock had many past names and owners until it landed in the wealthy hands of Manthuran Glaezel, the head of a prominent and long-standing Baldurian family.
