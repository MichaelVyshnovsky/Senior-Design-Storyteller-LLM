'''Glaezel's Dock''' was a small wharf of the western side of the [[Gray Harbor]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], owned by the [[Glaezel]] family of some prominence in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Glaezel's Dock stood at the end of [[Black Eel Street]] that crossed the [[Baldur's Gate/Seatower|Seatower]] district from the western city walls to the waters of the Gray Harbor. It was located between the [[Seatower of Balduran]] and the larger northern wharf – [[Hethkantle's Jetty]]. [[Sornbanner Street]] ran perpendicular to Glaezel's Dock, one city block away from the water.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, Glaezel's Dock had many past names and owners until it landed in the wealthy hands of [[Manthuran Glaezel]], the head of a prominent and long-standing Baldurian family.
