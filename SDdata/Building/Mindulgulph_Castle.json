        "mainbody": "indulgulph Castle was a large keep or castle in the hills south of Priapurl on the Dragon Coast. It sat atop a pinnacle that overlooked the town. It became the base of the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company.\nIn the early 1340s DR, an adventuring company including Gayrlana raided Mindulgulph Castle and discovered a number of intelligent, \"monstrous\", creatures dwelling inside. However, rather than slaying them as many adventurers would, they instead recruited the majority of them to their side. Gayrlana soon reformed the group into the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, and they took the castle as their base.\nIn the 1360s DR, Gayrlana led much of her company hundreds of miles from home to the Eastern Shaar, where they took an extended contract with the gold dwarves of the Great Rift. The remainder of the company remained in Priapurl and guarded Mindulgulph Castle.\nIt was well guarded by a number of the companys more monstrous members.\nCategoryCastles\nCategoryKeeps\nCategoryBuildings\nCategoryLocations in Priapurl\nCategoryLocations on the Dragon Coast\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nek02rf1aop867nlyy1g1nqrmwwlbn0z"
