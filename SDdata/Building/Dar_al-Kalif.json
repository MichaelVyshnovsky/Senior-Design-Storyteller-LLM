        "mainbody": "Dar al-Kalif, or the Crystal Palace, was the royal palace of Abu Bakr, Caliph of Semphar.\nDar al-Kalif was located in the heart of Dhaztanar.\nThe structure of the Crystal Palace was crowned with minarets of clear crystal rock, which was transported, at great expense, from the mines of the distant Firepeaks. Sunlight illuminated these crystal spires with radiance, giving Dhaztanar its nickname of the Shining City. A fire was lit within the tallest spire at night. Sailors on the Semphar Water could see the beacon from up to 50 miles (80 km) away. \nAbu Bakr lived within the palace."
