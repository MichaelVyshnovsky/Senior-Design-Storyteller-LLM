'''Moongleam Tower''' was the base of operations for the [[Harpers]] in [[Everlund]].

==Structure==
Built around [[1172 DR]], the hard black stone keep was visible from almost every part of Everlund. Comprising of four narrow, cylindrical towers joined together, its roof was crowned by a open turret where a signaling mirror shaped like a crescent moon stood. Moongleam Tower was surrounded by a dry moat although this could be quickly filled by a system of cisterns and pumps.
