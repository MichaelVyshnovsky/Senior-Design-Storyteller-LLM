Moongleam Tower was the base of operations for the Harpers in Everlund.
Built around 1172 DR, the hard black stone keep was visible from almost every part of Everlund. Comprising of four narrow, cylindrical towers joined together, its roof was crowned by a open turret where a signaling mirror shaped like a crescent moon stood. Moongleam Tower was surrounded by a dry moat although this could be quickly filled by a system of cisterns and pumps.
