It was a butchery and was owned by Haldos.\nThe butchery was in business by 1358 DR and still in business in 1369 DR.\nFamed traveler Volothamp Geddarm wrote about the business in Volos Guide to Cormyr.\nHaldoss Fine Butchery consisted of a shop, stockyards, and slaughterhouse, which all lay in the center of the city to the irritation of its neighbors. The sounds of animals, slaughter, and butchery were an annoyance to all.\nHaldos was a butcher, selling meat to his customers. He was one of the few who could slaughter a beast on the spot and provide the freshest possible meat, without being smoked and hung. This was valued by particular cooks, as well as alchemists, priests, and wizards, who required fresh meat for other purposes."
