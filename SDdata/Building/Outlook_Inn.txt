The '''Outlook Inn''' was an [[inn]] found just outside of [[Selgaunt]]'s walls.

==Location==
This large establishment was located just outside of Selgaunt's west gate along the [[Way of the Manticore]].

==Activities==
The Outlook Inn was a new and clean establishment as of [[1358 DR]]. Since the inn was located outside of Selgaunt's walls, they had no problems catering to [[adventurer]]s when compared to the vast majority of inns and [[tavern]]s found within the city proper.
