==Location==
The Dungeon Academy was located in the [[Veiled Mountains]], which were in the [[Endless Woods]], somewhere in Faerûn. It was {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}} from [[Horntree Village]].

==Structure==
The Dungeon Academy was an old building. Some parts of it were in poor condition. The first floor of the Academy was designed around a central corridor. Beneath that floor were the 'dungeon levels' for classes and other activities. The floors were connected by a large spiral staircase. Below, the Academy was connected to volcanic pools of magma.

==Interior==
The Academy was filled with [[bat]]s and old [[trap]]s. while others were freezing cold. A large pendulum in the corridor was used to help mark the time. Some notable areas included:
* Goreball Pitch: A [[grass]]y sporting field that lay outside. Students played the game [[goreball]] here.
* Dining Chamber: A room in which students ate meals like lunch. The students divided themselves up according to racial social groups.
* The Hall of Eternal Suffering and Monotony: A subterranean detention hall that was connected to the rest of the academy by a narrow bridge over a pool of magma.
* The Lurkery: A forest for students to practice their lurking in.
* The Library: An extensive six-story collection of all sorts of books.
* The Dean's Office: A well-decorated room home to the Dean.
* Dormitory: A series of rooms in which some students lived.

==Activities==
The Academy trained young monsters in the ways of being monsters before they graduated and were ultimately sent out to [[dungeon]]s. Introduction to Hoarding, Intro to Skulking, Taking Care of Your Hoard

Classes were held in semesters. Some classes were known to issue homework, in the form of essays. Students were also sometimes sent out into the outside world to practice what they had learnt. Some students organized in clubs, such as the [[Lurking Club]]. Students whose parents were employed by the Academy stayed on school premises.

The Academy had a particularly strong school spirit, which manifested in support for their goreball team, the [[Dungeon Academy Flumphs]]. The Flumphs, named for the school mascot of the [[flumph]], had an ongoing rivalry with the superior [[Waterdeep Dragons]] team. However, bullying was rampant at the school.

The rules of the school were outlined in [[The Dungeon Academy student handbook]]. The [[demilich]] Professor [[Gast]] was the only undead allowed on school premises. Kindness was also banned, and when exhibited, punishable by detention. Different professors took turns monitoring students in detention. The Academy had a school council that held votes to decide on school policies.

The Academy had an exchange program with [[slaad]]i from the plane of [[Limbo]].

There was also a yearbook that assigned students positions such as 'least likely to change'.

==Defenses==
The academy was secret and well defended. The Endless Woods, which surrounded the mountains in which the academy was located, only allowed passage to those that it deemed worthy, such as students of the Academy.

==History==
The Academy had existed for over 200 years. Its school mascot had previously been a [[bulette]], until 200 years ago it was changed to the flumph after a bulette attack.

The [[human]] [[barbarian]] [[Mad Smithy]] had in the past tried to take the Academy. He died in the process, but his [[greataxe]] remained as the pendulum for the clock in the corridor on the first floor. 

One winter, the [[necromancer]] [[Carrion (necromancer)|Lord Carrion]] used magic to take control of some students who had been sent on an excursion to Horntree Village. He was stopped by the newly formed [[Danger Club]] and the [[adventurer]] [[Allidora Steelstrike]].

==Inhabitants==
The Academy taught students of a variety of monstrous races including [[slaadi]], [[gnoll]]s, [[dao]], [[myconid]]s, [[mimic]]s, [[owlbear]]s, [[ooze]]s, [[kuo-toa]], [[goblin]]s, [[bugbear]]s and [[flail snail]]s. The staff of the Academy were equally varied and strange.
It should be noted that some of these creatures, like owlbears and oozes, are normally non-intelligent and therefore incapable of learning.
