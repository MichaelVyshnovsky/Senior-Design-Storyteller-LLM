Gublins Cloth & Cordage was a shop in Daggerford that specialized in selling cloths and ropes. It was run by the successful businessman Gilly Gublin.
The shop was located in Daggerfords Farmers Quarter.
Within the top floor of the shop was some specialized machinery that wound strands together to make rope. The device originated from the High House of Wonders in the southern city of Baldurs Gate.
Gillys sold high-quality textiles and cordage, particularly those varieties that were imported from elsewhere. Despite the high caliber of his goods, Gillys prices were so low that few others could compete.
