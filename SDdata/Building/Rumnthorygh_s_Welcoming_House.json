        "mainbody": "century DR\nRumnthoryghs Welcoming House was a cheerful and popular inn in Mosstone, owned by Alzarro Rumnthorygh in the mid-to-late 14 century DR and Alzarro later expanded his business.\nAn old crumbling wooden porch punctuated Rumnthoryghs location with two pieces of mismatched decorations on each side. One of them was a rearing unicorn, and the one opposite it was a mermaid cradling a man at her breast. Both wooden figurines were bowsprits fetched from Firedrake Bay shipwrecks.\nRumnthoryghs inn was once a small establishment that did a lot of business. So small, in fact, that Alzarro Rumnthorygh was forced to sleep in the stables on rafters. The kitchen was immensely busy, drowned in chaos and the heat of endless cooking, and unable to feed swarms of customers in a timely manner. The old kitchen was also tiny and had no space to sit down and catch a breath.\nLater, Alzarro Rumnthorygh expanded his business. Alzarro constructed a new wing in the back of the building. This expansion made the inn calmer and roomier and significantly more comfortable for guests and staff. Post-expansion, Alzarro raised prices to pay for the hefty investment.\nThe rooms of the inn could be considered thoughtful and welcoming. The rooms had bootjacks, bedside towels, and disrobing chairs that could also be used for drying hats and cloaks.\nRumnthoryghs Welcoming House was renowned for being cheap and cheerful, which translated into being always busy and crammed. However, the dining hall was filled with cheerful noise. Customers and staff were always pleasant and upbeat.\nApart from lodging, Rumnthoryghs Welcoming House offered a fine dining experience. The inns specialty was stuffed chicken drowned in lush fragrant sauces. The rest of the menu was plain but nevertheless good-quality food."
