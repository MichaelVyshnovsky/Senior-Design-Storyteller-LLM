        "mainbody": "'''Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House''' was a cheerful and popular inn in [[Mosstone]], owned by [[Alzarro Rumnthorygh]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR and Alzarro later expanded his business.",
        "Location": "An old crumbling wooden porch punctuated Rumnthorygh's location with two pieces of mismatched decorations on each side. One of them was a rearing [[unicorn]], and the one opposite it was a [[mermaid]] cradling a man at her breast. Both wooden figurines were [[bowsprit]]s fetched from [[Firedrake Bay]] shipwrecks.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House was renowned for being cheap and cheerful, which translated into being always busy and crammed. However, the dining hall was filled with cheerful noise. Customers and staff were always pleasant and upbeat."
        },
        "Services": "Apart from lodging, Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House offered a fine dining experience. The inn's specialty was [[stuffed chicken]] drowned in lush fragrant sauces. The rest of the menu was plain but nevertheless good-quality food."
