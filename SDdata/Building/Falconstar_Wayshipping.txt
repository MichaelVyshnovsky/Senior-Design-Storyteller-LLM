'''Falconstar Wayshipping''' was a [[business]] located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. It rented out storage space for cargo. It was owned by [[Mhaernos Falconstar]].

==Description & Defenses==
Falconstar Wayshipping made up the southernmost reach of the city on the east bank of the [[Wyvernflow]], ''circa'' [[1369 DR]], lying south of the [[Cormyrean Coins Coster]] compound. The business included a warehouse and a wharf, which were lit by ''[[driftglobe]]''s. Two [[zombie]] [[ettin]]s guarded the wharf, guards watched the warehouse. Assisting these guards was some worse creature that twice killed and devoured whole raiding pirate bands.

==Services==
The business rented storage space to caravan masters and ship captains transshipping or wayshipping their cargoes between land and river routes.

==History==
Falconstar Wayshipping was in business by [[1358 DR]] and still in business in [[1369 DR]].
