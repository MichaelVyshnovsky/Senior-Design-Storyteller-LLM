Falconstar Wayshipping was a business located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. It rented out storage space for cargo. It was owned by Mhaernos Falconstar.
Falconstar Wayshipping made up the southernmost reach of the city on the east bank of the Wyvernflow, circa 1369 DR, lying south of the Cormyrean Coins Coster compound. The business included a warehouse and a wharf, which were lit by driftglobes. Two zombie ettins guarded the wharf, guards watched the warehouse. Assisting these guards was some worse creature that twice killed and devoured whole raiding pirate bands.
The business rented storage space to caravan masters and ship captains transshipping or wayshipping their cargoes between land and river routes.
Falconstar Wayshipping was in business by 1358 DR and still in business in 1369 DR.
Famed traveler Volothamp Geddarm wrote about the business in Volos Guide to Cormyr.
