Tojos was a well-known restaurant in the town of Aru in Wa in the 1770s on the Wa Calendar. It was run by Tojo Marushima. It stood in the Mixed District, beside the gate to the Merchant District and directly opposite rival restaurant Akis.
In , Tojo declared his restaurant to be the best in Aru, but so did his brother and business rival Aki. To settle the question, they each mightve offered a group of adventurers a free meal, one night after the other, so they could serve as impartial judges. However, Aki would pay a person to slip a mild purgative into their food when they dined at Tojos, which would cause them gastrointestinal problems during their adventures.
