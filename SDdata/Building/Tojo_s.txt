'''Tojo's''' was a well-known restaurant in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]]. It was run by [[Tojo Marushima]]. It stood in the Mixed District, beside the gate to the Merchant District and directly opposite rival restaurant [[Aki's]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Tojo declared his restaurant to be the best in Aru, but so did his brother and business rival [[Aki Marushima|Aki]]. To settle the question, they each might've offered a group of adventurers a free meal, one night after the other, so they could serve as impartial judges. However, Aki would pay a person to slip a mild purgative into their food when they dined at Tojo's, which would cause them gastrointestinal problems during their adventures.
