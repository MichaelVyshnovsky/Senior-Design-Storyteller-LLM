        "mainbody": "'''Watcher's Keep''' was an ancient keep of unknown origin, that became associated with the deity [[Helm]] and the [[Knights of the Vigil]]. It was a powerful prison, used to house the most terrible beings whose power was troubling even to the gods themselves.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}",
        "Location": "It was located in the realm of [[Tethyr]], west of the [[Wealdath]] near the coast.",
        "Structure": "The stone keep was built out of a rocky tor jutting out of the ground. It comprised six levels, in descending order from the uppermost floor.\n\nThe rooftop entrance to the keep was sealed by a hemi-spherical passageway. It could only be opened with the use of a unique ''[[vigil stone|wardstone]]''. Along one side of the keep was a series of doorways that could only be opened from within the keep.",
        "Interior": {
            "Altar Level": "[[File:WK1.png|thumb|right|300px|The Altar Level]]\nThe topmost level of Watcher's Keep served as a sort of temple to [[Helm]]. It held the private quarters of the keep's priests, a small Helmite tomb, as well as an extensive library that encircled a large central hallway. The hall was decorated with stone statues of various [[humanoid]] figures, built alongside four rows of pillared archways, each of which was adorned with a banner that depicted Helm's watchful eye. Within the center of the hall was the floor's portal; at its rear was the altar used by the members of the Vigil, set in front of an enormous statue of Helm.\n\nIn order to activate the level's portal, the Helmite prayer ritual had to be performed at the altar in the correct manner. Doing so would activate the statues located in the central hallway, causing them to come alive with great hostility. One of these humanoid statues was equipped with the ''[[Usuno's blade|personal blade]]'' of the legendary [[Kara-Tur]]an [[Yakuza]] named [[Usuno]], while another wielded ''[[Foebane]]'', one of the [[Baneblades of Demron]].\n\nThe library held a number of notable tomes including the ''[[Elminster's Ecologies Appendix IIIa|third appendix]]'' of ''[[Elminster's Ecologies (in-universe)|Elminster's Ecologies]]'', a ''[[golem manual]]'', and fittingly, the ''[[History of the Imprisoned One]]''.\n\nAs of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], this level was inhabited both by the ghost of [[Giltham|Giltham the Archivist]], as well as more malevolent spirits, such as [[vampiric wraith]]s and [[wandering horror]]s.",
            "Elemental Level": "[[File:WK2.png|thumb|right|300px|The Elemental Level]]\nThe second level of the keep comprised a central, circular room that was encircled by eight other, a library and laboratory designated for each of the four elements. The central room itself housed a magically enhanced cage and two ''[[portal]]s'', one that led to an exit outside the keep, and another connected to the keep's third level.\n\nWithin the center room was a magically-enchanted cage created by four [[archmage]]s, each of whom experimented and studied one of the four elements. They were rivals with one another, often acting against the mage of their opposing element. Trapped within the cage was a [[chromatic demon]], who had been tricked and imprisoned around the 4{{th}} century [[DR]] in order to secure the Imprisoned One on [[Toril]]. It could only be freed by using the four ''scepter keys'' in the possession of the archmages.\n\nEach of the archmage's respective laboratories and libraries were quite dangerous. The air laboratory had a giant fan that created [[guardian of air|guardians of air]] when it was powered up; the slime chamber was filled with toxic mist, that formed as [[poison mist|semi-sentient creatures]]; the air in the ice lab was extremely cold, to where it could freeze a creature solid; and the fire chamber contained a bubbling pool of lava, and granted its [[fire giant]] guardian a form of invulnerability. After the archmages were no longer present, the level became overrun with their creations; among these creatures were [[air elemental]]s, [[mutated spider]]s, a [[giant snake]], [[ice golem]]s, and [[fire elemental]]s.\n\nThe chromatic demon was in possession of the ''portal key'' that granted access to the third level of the keep.",
            "Maze Level": "The third level of Watcher's Keep comprised a dozen separate rooms, each connected to one another by ''portals''. The rooms were oriented in such a way that portals were located at each of the cardinal directions, or along the north-south axis. To navigate the maze, an individual had to enter through the correct ''portals'' in a specific order – with the catch being that entering through a ''portal'' in which you already came, did not return you to your previous location.\n\nThe different rooms were distinctly set as either [[wild magic]] or [[dead-magic zone]]s, and were somewhat navigable by the central landmarks they featured. One room had a stone obelisk in the center, while another held a single tree. Yet one of the other rooms featured a stone pillar, within which was set ''[[Purifier]]'', the sword of the lost knight [[Wediyer|Sir Wediyer]].\n\nThe penultimate ''portal'' in the series led to cave set within natural rock formation. Within that cavern was the final entryway that offered passage to the keep's fourth level.",
            "Machine Level": "[[File:WK4.png|thumb|right|300px|The Machine Level]]\nThe predominant feature of the fourth level of Watcher's Keep was a device known as the ''[[machine of Lum the Mad]]'', an icosahedral device that featured a number of mechanical, steam-powered arms. The operator of the machine was granted access its wide-range of powers, the scope of which was likely not fully known. By manipulating a series of colored dials, shaped buttons and levers of varying lengths, an individual could create a wide variety of effects, such as spawning beings from other [[planes of existence]], conjuring ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[lightning bolt|bolts of lightning]]'', ''[[imprisonment|trapping the operator deep beneath the earth]]'', or even increasing their mental acuity or physical strength. There were a total of 729 combinations that could be made with the various controls, though some of these gave duplicate effects.\n\nJust around the corner from the hall that housed [[Lum]]'s machine was a smaller, secured room that could only be open by lighting a number of braziers with colored flames. Within this chamber was a mallet made of [[crystal]], the only item known to be able to destroy the glass casing that protected the machine's operator. The chest with the ''crystal mallet'' was protected by a pair of [[minotaur]] guardians, [[Rock (minotaur)|Rock]] and [[Garock]].\n\nBeyond the machine room two areas that would later be taken over and reshaped by some of those creatures brought to Watcher's Keep from other planes.",
            "Final Seal": "[[File:WK5.png|thumb|right|300px|The Final Seal]]\nThe fifth level of Watcher's keep contained Helm's final seal, which kept the Imprisoned One bound to Toril and prevented it from returning to their home plane of existence. The seal could only be opened when three keys were used, one each for the mind, heart, and spirit.\n\nDown the level's west-facing hall was a puzzle-device featuring three pillars and colored globes that were dispensed by a machine. If the puzzle was not solved in the correct order various waves of murderous [[beast]]s, [[monstrous humanoid]]s, mindless [[undead]], and hostile [[spellcaster]]s were conjured fourth. When the puzzle was completed, the ''mind key'' could be used on the final seal. Doing so summoned forth an [[aurumach]] and several [[ferrumach]] [[rilmani]] from the [[Outlands]], all of whom were hostile to whomever turned the key.\n\nThe southern hall was watched over by the [[ghost]] of a knight of the Vigil. They presented three challenges that had to be completed in order to receive the ''heart key''. The mental challenge involved several riddles posed by an [[imp]], the perseverance challenge meant fighting an entire horde of [[orc]]s within a small cave, and the courage challenge included the defeat of a powerful [[green dragon]]. Using the key on the final seal summoned a powerful group of allies: the fiends [[Nalmissra]], [[Xei Win Toh]], and the [[Huntress]], the [[marilith]] [[Y'tossi]], the [[drow]] [[Ameralis Zauviir]], along with their [[hive mother]] ally.\n\n[[File:ImprisonedOne.png|thumb|right|300px|The chamber of the Imprisoned One]]\n\nThe east-facing hall, which allowed an individual to inhabit the consciousness of a spirit warrior. In order to receive the ''spirit key'', they had to navigate the warrior through their quest to defeat the [[mummy]] of the crypt. Using this key on the seal summoned forth the final guardian group linked to the level, the lich [[Azamantes]] and a trio of [[flaming skull]]s.",
            "Imprisoned One": "The cell of the imprisoned one was a simple circular platform, partially encircled by a dual staircase and flanked by two pillars inscribed with the [[holy symbol]] of Helm. The Imprisoned One itself was not readily visible within this chamber, but could be heard and spoken to as it wished."
        },
        "Defenses": "Watcher's Keep was protected more from the threats within its structure, rather than those that may have assaulted it from outside. The magic protecting the seal on its final level was very powerful, but required great sacrifice.",
        "History": "The keep was a millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]], around the 4{{th}} century DR, as a prison for the most dangerous and evil creatures the gods themselves wanted locked away.\n\nWhile it was unknown exactly when, the archmages of the elemental level eventually killed one another in a massive magical explosion. The chromatic demon was left imprisoned within its elemental cage.\n\nAt some point a group of adventurers traveled into the keep in search for treasure and made their way down to the maze level, but were halted when one of the ''portals'' malfunctioned. Eventually most of the group died and the only one to remain was the [[elf]] who came to be known as [[Tamorlin|Yakman]]. While he maintained possession of the ''[[staff of radiance]]'' that allowed entry to the next level, he became delusional after years of isolation, and even more fearful following the appearance the maze level's [[fiend]]ish inhabitants.\n\nSome time before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of adventurers made their way into the keep and down to the  fourth level of the Keep. The [[wizard]] [[Carston]] abandoned his group for the power of Lum's machine. After taking control of the device he managed to spawn forth various creatures from across the planes, some of whom fought one another for Carston's amusement. Among those relocated were the [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s that were engaged in battle in the [[Blood War]], the particularly vain [[red dragon]] [[Saladrex]], as well as numerous groups of [[illithid]]s and [[githyanki]] warriors, some of whom had been traveling in their [[astral ship]].\n\nBy means of Carston's blunders, the maze level became infested with the two factions of fiends who had been transported from their respective homes in the [[lower planes]]. [[Ka'rashur]] led the group of [[devil]]s, which included several [[cornugon]]s, [[tiefling]]s, and the [[pit fiend]] from the [[Nine Hells]]; while the [[Tanar'ri]] [[Tahazzar]] led the [[glabrezu]], [[succubi]], and the [[balor]] that came from the [[Abyss]]. While stuck on the [[Prime Material plane]], the two fiendish factions continued their their age-old conflict within the labyrinthine domain of Watcher's Keep.\n\nThe groups of illithids and githyanki each formed their respective encampments within the fourth level of the keep. Like the demons and devils, they continued their eternal battle while stuck on Toril, often for the amusement of the delusional Carston.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], the Imprisoned One's seal became weakened by the Imprisoned One's power. While Helm was the only god not given mortal form in [[Faerûn]], he directly tasked the Knights of the Vigil to watch over the keep, so as to never let the Imprisoned One escape or be slain on the Prime. Doing so would just sent the being back to its domain in the Abyss.\n\nTo keep the wards holding the Imprisoned One intact, the knights of the vigil were required to regularly sacrifice one of their own members. This tradition of duty continued until the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, when the Knights of the Vigil lost their determination to make the sacrifices necessary to uphold their oath. Their leader [[Odren]] began to spread rumors throughout the land to lure adventurers to the keep, promising rewards for helping them.\n\nThe [[Bhaalspawn]] adventurer [[Abdel Adrian]] and his companions heeded the call of the knights and journeyed into Watcher's Keep. Odren gave Abdel the ''ritual scroll'' that would allow him to reinforce the magic of the seal, and unknowingly seal himself and his allies within Watcher's Keep. While it was unknown what exactly happened, Abdel and his companions did not perform the ritual and the Imprisoned One did not remain sealed away for good."
