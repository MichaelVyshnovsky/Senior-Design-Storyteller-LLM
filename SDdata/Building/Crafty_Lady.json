        "mainbody": "The '''Crafty Lady''' was an inn and tavern in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It stood by the docks.{{Cite document/Procampur City Expansion Packet|3}}{{Cite organized play/LC/A Friendly Suggestion|12-13}}",
        "Location": "It stood by the docks in the [[Port District]] and was easy to find, for no other place looked as bad. It was perhaps the most dilapidated tavern in the district. It was a block away from [[warehouse 5]].",
        "Description": "Inside, the d√©cor was little more than junk, with crude chairs that squeaked and tables so unfinished they'd leave a careless diner with splinters.",
        "Services": "Although poorly maintained and poorly operated, it was at least appropriately cheap and the drinks and food were of matching quality.",
        "History": "In [[Tarsakh]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} [[Damon Norvill]] frequented the Crafty Lady. He was found there by a band of [[adventurer]]s hired by Lady [[Phoebe Piniago]] to investigate some suspicious addictive [[candy]] her husband Lord [[Aldo Piniago]] was consuming."
