        "Location": "The temple was the lone standing structure in that part of the Undercity. It was surrounded by a great many ruins.",
        "Structure": "The exterior of the temple was built in such a way that its walls appeared to be made from (or actually were made from) hundreds of bones formed together into massive blocks. It was decorated with armored figures and several large, [[humanoid]] skulls.",
        "Interior": "[[File:Altar_of_Bhaal_CLB.png|thumb|right|250px|''[[Cult of the Absolute|Cultists of the Absolute]] at Bhaal's altar within the temple.'']]\nThe interior of the building was just as imposing. Six statues robed figures wielding [[scythe]]s lined the sides of the main chamber. Two [[fiend]]ish statues were set along the rear wall.\n\nIn the center of the temple was a massive carving of Bhaal's [[holy symbol]].\n\nBeyond that was the actual altar that was presumably used by [[Church of Bhaal|Bhaalist]] [[priest]]s. It was decorated with an exquisite tapestry and basins of shimmering purple liquid.",
        "Defenses": "By the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple was riddled with deadly traps. For instance, each of the twelve 'tears of Bhaal' on the floor's holy symbol were trapped in a manner that they could not be disarmed by normal means.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Bhaalspawn]] [[Sarevok]] designated this temple as the location within which he would perform the dark [[ritual]] that would elevate him as the new Lord of Murder.\n\nSome time before [[Uktar]] of that year, Sarevok and his last remaining allies made a final stand against [[Abdel Adrian]] and his allies. Among the combatants were the bandit leader [[Tazok]], the [[conjurer]] [[Semaj]], and the disgraced [[Flaming Fist]] officer, [[Angelo Dosan]]. The battle ended with the death of Sarevok and the end of his attempted coup of Baldur's Gate.\n\nThough the temple had been destroyed by the heroic group, it was rebuilt sometime in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, with Sarevok as custodian of the [[Murder Tribunal]] and [[Dark Urge]], a pure blood Bhaalspawn leading the Bhaalist cult. Later Sarevok's granddaughter [[Orin]] usurpered Dark Urged and ruled over the temple instead",
        "Inhabitants": "One side of the temple featured a half dozen sarcophagi, several of which housed [[undead]] [[battle horror]]s.",
