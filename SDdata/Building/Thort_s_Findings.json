        "Services": "Thort's sold a variety of exotic goods, artifacts, relics, and oddities that had been brought in by [[adventurer]]s. Many of these came from [[dungeon]]s, such as the local [[Undermountain]]. These items were all displayed with little hand-written placards that either identified them or provided speculation as to their purpose and origin. Beyond merely selling items, Thort's was known to rent out its curios as decor to wealthy merchants and [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobles]] in search of props for their themed revels.",
        "Activities": "The hidden rooms within Thort's served as safe houses for agents of the [[Harpers]] or the organization's contacts.",

        "History": "Thort's Findings was established sometime after [[1385 DR]], the year in which the Walking Statues rampaged across the city as a result of the [[Spellplague]]. The shop was still in operation by [[1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}",
        "Inhabitants": "Thort's was owned, operated, and lived-in by the retired adventurer [[Undevver Thort]]."
