        "mainbody": "Thorts Findings was a small curios shop in the city of Waterdeep that was housed within the detached head of the Swordmaiden, one of the colossal Walking Statues of Waterdeep.\nThe shop stood in a city square between Hassantyrs Street, Tarsars Street, Whaelgond Way, and Ussilbran Street.\nThe hollowed-out head of the Swordmaiden had multiple floors with tight staircases and landings. It also sported a number of hidden rooms.\nThorts sold a variety of exotic goods, artifacts, relics, and oddities that had been brought in by adventurers. Many of these came from dungeons, such as the local Undermountain. These items were all displayed with little hand-written placards that either identified them or provided speculation as to their purpose and origin. Beyond merely selling items, Thorts was known to rent out its curios as decor to wealthy merchants and Waterdhavian nobles in search of props for their themed revels.\nThe hidden rooms within Thorts served as safe houses for agents of the Harpers or the organizations contacts.\nThorts was regularly visited by all manner of alchemists, sages, and wizards in search of items that could prove useful.\nThorts Findings was established sometime after 1385 DR, the year in which the Walking Statues rampaged across the city as a result of the Spellplague. The shop was still in operation by 1492 DR.\nThorts was owned, operated, and lived-in by the retired adventurer Undevver Thort."
