            "14{{th}} Century": "{{Quote|My agents in Thay report that Szass Tam has hidden himself away in the Citadel, an ancient fortress deep in Thaymount. They say he is preparing some new outrage. What it is I do not know.|The Simbul, 1368 DR.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Citadel and in fact all of Thaymount became engulfed with Red Wizard activities. [[Tharchion]]s from across Thay, along with [[zulkir]]s of the [[Council of Zulkirs|eponymous council]] made numerous visits to the region, and doubled and redoubled the number of troops they garrisoned within.\n\nA [[1368 DR|few years later]], the ever-curious [[Simbul]] recruited a band of [[adventurer]]s to infiltrate the Citadel and investigate Szass Tam and whatever schemes he was surely concocting.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves Thayan tower.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''A light show and smoke machine are sure to get the party started.'']]\nAccording to history books a century later, and as [[Xenk Yendar]] would recall, in the mid-1370s [[DR]], Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of the Thaymount tharch, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on [[Kythorn 19|the eve]] of the [[summer solstice]]. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.<ref group=\"note\">''Honor Among Thieves'' only says \"the capital\" of Thay, which at the time should be [[Eltabbar]]. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tam's tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead.<ref group=\"note\">''Honor Among Thieves'' mentions only the eve of the solstice; due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god [[Amaunator]] has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass interrupted Zulkir [[Dmitra Flass]] as she addressed the crowd and produced a red horn from under his robes. With it, he cast the ''beckoning death'', thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain by Red Wizards in his service, among them [[Sofina]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} Xenk saw a girl his age, [[Ishira]], standing alone and lost in the panic.It is difficult to reconcile Xenk's account and the scenes in ''Honor Among Thieves'' with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tam's betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in ''The Crimson Gold'' in 1373 DR; the meeting of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tam's takeover of Thay in ''Unclean'' in 1375 DR; and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenk's childhood memories, it's presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.",
