        "mainbody": "he Temple of Umberlee located in the Thayan city of Bezantur was one of the biggest and most extensive temples dedicated to Umberlee in all of Faer√ªn. The temple was one of the most popular in Bezantur, the so-called City of a Thousand Temples, owing to the importance of the sea to that citys economy.\nThe temple was located near the citys docks, facing south overlooking the Alamber Sea.\nThe building itself was described as both monstrously large and grim to behold. It was built of massive blocks of blue-veined green marble, giving it the appearance of the ocean depths.\nThe temple was notable for its unique twist on the traditional way in which offerings were given to the goddess Umberlee. Normally, members of her church were expected to throw gold and gems into the sea to appease her, but instead, the congregation at Bezantur would recruit local thugs to attack ships in port and rob them of their valuables, a portion of which would then be thrown into the sea as tribute. The remainder was then split between the thugs and the temple. It was said that any treasure hunter who ventured into the harbor to claim some of the treasures given to Umberlee in this way would inevitably drown to death, if not in the harbor itself then wherever they fled to after. Individuals were said to have been discovered as far off as the Anauroch desert&mdashwith no water for miles&mdashdrowned and with horrified expressions on their faces.\nUnder this system of tribute collection&mdashof which Umberlee appeared to approve&mdashthe temple became quite wealthy, and was known to host lavish parties in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nWorship of Umberlee&mdashas with most of the Gods of Fury&mdashwas not popular in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles.\nAs of the 1360s DR, the temple was directly overseeing its practice of robbing ships in the name of sacrifices Umberlee, but as of the , this practice had become popular among the laypeople of Bezantur as well.\nThe temple had a staff of over one hundred faithful priests and acolytes. They were overseen by high priestess Alyssa in the mid-to-late 14 century DR."
