        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Umberlee''' located in the [[Thay]]an city of [[Bezantur]] was one of the biggest and most extensive temples dedicated to [[Umberlee]] in all of [[Faer√ªn]]. The temple was one of the most popular in Bezantur, the so-called City of a Thousand Temples, owing to the importance of the sea to that city's economy.",
        "Location": "The temple was located near the city's docks, facing south overlooking the [[Alamber Sea]].",
        "Structure": "The building itself was described as both monstrously large and grim to behold. It was built of massive blocks of blue-veined green [[marble]], giving it the appearance of the ocean depths.",
        "Activities": "The temple was notable for its unique twist on the traditional way in which offerings were given to the [[goddess]] Umberlee. Normally, members of her [[Church of Umberlee|church]] were expected to throw [[gold]] and [[gems]] into the sea to appease her, but instead, the congregation at Bezantur would recruit local thugs to attack ships in port and rob them of their valuables, a portion of which would then be thrown into the sea as tribute. The remainder was then split between the thugs and the temple. It was said that any treasure hunter who ventured into the harbor to claim some of the treasures given to Umberlee in this way would inevitably drown to death, if not in the harbor itself then wherever they fled to after. Individuals were said to have been discovered as far off as the [[Anauroch]] desert&mdash;with no water for miles&mdash;drowned and with horrified expressions on their faces.\n\nUnder this system of tribute collection&mdash;of which Umberlee appeared to approve&mdash;the temple became quite wealthy, and was known to host lavish parties in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "Worship of Umberlee&mdash;as with most of the [[Gods of Fury]]&mdash;was not popular in Thay prior to the [[Time of Troubles]].<ref name=DotRW-p50\">\n\nAs of the 1360s DR, the temple was directly overseeing its practice of robbing ships in the name of sacrifices Umberlee, but as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, this practice had become popular among the laypeople of Bezantur as well.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple had a staff of over one hundred faithful [[priests]] and acolytes. They were overseen by high priestess [[Alyssa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR."
