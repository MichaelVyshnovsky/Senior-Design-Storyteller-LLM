This led said owner to become somewhat worried; he contacted the [[War Wizards]] to see to additional security, as the security he hired kept accepting bribes from the nobles intending to attend.\n\nAn altercation resulted from the convergence of numerous murderous [[blueflame ghost]]s, sent by [[Cymmarra]] and Lord [[Calantar (Lord)|Calantar]] during the performance.",
