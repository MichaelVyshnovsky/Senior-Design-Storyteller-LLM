Durinbold & Oathoon was a shop that supplied provisions to businesses of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, Durinbold & Oathoon faced supply chain difficulties due to caravans not being able to freely enter the city. Martnev Oathoon, Valued Customer Disciplinarian, sent out a notification letter to Oliver Tefoco of The Bee Hive in the Lower City, informing him of the suspension of food and dry goods deliveries that would eventually renew when the crisis ended. During the same year, Pammella Nortale of Nortales Hostel, was in debt to Durinbold & Oathoon and missed a months payment. The provisioners demanded her to make a minimum payment or be tuned over to the Fist Repossessions.
