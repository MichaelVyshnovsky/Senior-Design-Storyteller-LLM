'''Thalarmol's''' was a business in [[Kholtar]], [[south Faer没n]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|68}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Kh么ltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}

==Location==
Thalarmol's was located on the south side of [[Hael Way]] between [[Halamor's Sure Service]] and [[Elduskryn's Fiery Creations]], not far from Farrgaunlar (the southern gate out of Kholtar). Across the street was a klathlaaedin (fancy mansion) named [[Anthormbrur]] belonging to the [[Horthander]] family.

==Services==
Thalarmol's made generic and custom crates for shipping goods so they would withstand travel by caravan. They were in an advantageous location with Halamor's next door, as customers used the delivery service to send items to Thalarmol's.
