Castle '''Felmorel''' was a castle in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The castle stood somewhere to the west of the village of [[Hammershaws]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|564-565|4}}

==Interior==
The entrance was dark-paneled on the inside. There were brass lamps.

At least one guestroom was small but had a high ceiling, with old tapestries and a canopied bed, with candles for light set across the room. A room not far from there, used for rituals, had a glass-smooth floor. Nasmaerae's bedchambers were accessible through a secret path leading to the back of her closet.

==Activities==
The Lord of the castle, [[Esbre Felmorel]], was known to hold feasts with unexpected guests.

==Defenses==
The gate usually sported three guards in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]]; as of {{yearlink|761}} those guards included [[Glavyn]] and [[Feiryn]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|562-563|3}} Another man-at-arms present was called [[Errart]]. At least one chamber had protections built into the stone. By {{yearlink|767}}, the Lord employed one or more mages capable of using spells.

==History==
In spring of the {{yearlinkName|761}}, [[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], invited himself at the last minute to a feast at Castle Felmorel, over the objections of one of the guards, Glavyn; he used magic to disable the guard's upper limbs just before the man drew his weapons. Before the situation further degenerated, Lady [[Nasmaerae Felmorel]] witnessed the exchange and personally invited him to the feast.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|549-551|3}}

The feast Elminster joined, hosted by Lord Esbre and Lady Nasmaerae, had two other guests of note: archmage [[Thessamel Arunder]], and the warrior and explorer [[Barundryn Harbright]]. Before they joined, there were already a number of refreshments on the table, including [[whellusk]], half-shell and all, and also soft [[cheese]] with [[spices]]. The main dishes included sauced venison, a [[three-serpent pie]] that was crusty, and a [[lizard soup]] with [[pepper]], roasted [[boar]], and spitted fowl. The archmage was cautiously suspicious about Elminster, who found much agreement with the explorer over the feast. While they knew nothing of [[Dasumia]],{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|551-554|3}} the host and guests attested to a "Lady of Shadows" ruling nearby lands, with Thessamel being surprisingly quiet about her.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|557|3}}

Lady Nasmaerae attempted to cast some spell to subsume Elminster's power or knowledge during the night, and found herself thwarted by [[Azuth]]'s warding over Elminster. As a warning, Azuth broke her spell-thrall over her husband and warned her that if she attempted that spell again, she'd lose all her spells. Esbre immediately forced her to recast the spell, resulting in the definitive loss of her powers.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|558-561|3}}

In the aftermath of these events, Esbre Felmorel declared Azuth would be worshiped in his home henceforth. Elminster left before dawn, and the mage Thessamel Arunder followed him out.

During the brief period of spell failure in {{yearlinkName|767}}, Lord and Lady Felmorel were still married, and Lady Felmorel was concerned about the loss of spells, though she hadn't regained her own use of magic.
