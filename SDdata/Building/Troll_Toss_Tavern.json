        "mainbody": "The Troll Toss Tavern was a rowdy tavern in the city of Phlan of the Moonsea region in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe taverns name was written on a sign that hung over its entrance.\nDuring Phlans occupation by monstrous servants of Tyranthraxus, the building that later became the Troll Toss Tavern was used as a granary, manned by a band of trolls and ogres who spent their days tossing sacks of grain about, with an occasional adventurer being tossed for good measure. As the city of Phlan was liberated, the trolls and ogres were killed by a band of adventurers. As of the , the Troll Toss Tavern claimed the building and named it after its old occupants. To keep the tradition going, the innkeep hired a group of four ettins to toss sacks of grain for sport and entertainment of the taverns guests. The innkeep considered this sport a mite dangerous, and the giants were not opposed to starting brawls with stronger tavern guests."
