        "mainbody": "ldinaths ArmsÂ was a smithy in the town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 and late 15 centuries DR. A longtime staple of Triboar, the shop was in the familys name for generations and known for high quality.\nAlthough a swordsmith by trade, Aldenar produced an impressive range of high-quality smithwork of all kinds that were sold in shops found all over the North and along the Sword Coast. Their eyebolts, latches, nails, and pins supported Wainwrights Wagons and all Triboars wainwrights in their success. Though the prices were slightly cheaper than normal, the metal and workmanship were to a higher standard. In the late 15 century DR, it sold fine weapons that were stamped with the Uldinath family glyph, which meant they typically sold for 25% more than the typical price.\nIt stood atop a hill in the far northeastern side of town, on the east side of the Long Road opposite Foehammers Forge. Foehammers and Uldinaths maintained a long-standing but friendly rivalry.\nIt was founded by Aldenar Uldinath and was in business by the mid-1360s DR.\nBy 1485 DR, it was run by his great-granddaughter, Harriet Uldinath."
