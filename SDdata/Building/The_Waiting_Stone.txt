'''The Waiting Stone''' was a ''[[ryokan]]'' (inn) in [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]]. It stood in the northern Mixed District. It was run by a woman known as a [[Wikipedia:mama-san|''mama-san'']].

==Description==
Rooms were divided by [[wikipedia:Shoji|''shoji'']] screens and were warmed by braziers on which aromatic woods were burned. Each had futon beds.

==History==
In high summer of {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, a group of adventurers newly arrived in Aru were staying at The Waiting Stone. It was here, late at night, that a troop of [[samurai]] led by [[Tsukku]] woke and summoned them to a midnight meeting with the [[daimyo]], [[Benju Matsutomo]]. with the [[monk]] [[Yaemon]] possibly sending them a message, and any blow-back from their investigations and associations potentially finding them here. On a later night, samurai once again woke and summoned the adventurers to a meeting, this time in secrecy with Benju's consort [[Naomi (consort)|Naomi]]. At one point, their rooms may have been ransacked by a thief in black looking for valuables to steal; the ''mama-san'' saw the thief leave but thought it was just another odd visitor.
