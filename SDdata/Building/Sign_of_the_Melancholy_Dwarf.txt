The Sign of the Melancholy Dwarf was an expensive inn in the North around the 14 century DR.This inn was not given a specific location in the "The Ship of Night". Rather, the adventure stated that it could potentially be in Neverwinter, Silverymoon, or Waterdeep.
This inn served a variety of food. Including potatos, yams, various sweetmeats, and wines.
In the back of the Melancholy Dwarf were privacy booths with curtains.
At some point a respected dwarven sage, Birgit of the Iron House, invited a group of adventurers to meet her at this inn in order to discuss hiring them for a quest.
