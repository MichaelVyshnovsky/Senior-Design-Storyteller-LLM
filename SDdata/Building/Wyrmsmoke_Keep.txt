'''Wyrmsmoke Keep''' was a [[cloud palace]] occupied by the [[Wyrmsmoke cell]] of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Keep floated high over the [[Galena Mountains]], halfway between [[Hulburg]] and [[Glister]].

==Defenses==
The fortress was garrisoned by three [[dragonkin]] tribes; a tribe of [[Draconic creature (template)|draconic]] [[orc]]s, which raised [[fire drake]]s as guardians; and several commanders, mostly orcish or [[ogre|ogrish]] variants.

==Notable Inhabitants==
The [[Wyrmsmoke cell]] operated out of the citadel.
