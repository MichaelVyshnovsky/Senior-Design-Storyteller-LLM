Wyrmsmoke Keep was a cloud palace occupied by the Wyrmsmoke cell of the Cult of the Dragon during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Keep floated high over the Galena Mountains, halfway between Hulburg and Glister.
The fortress was garrisoned by three dragonkin tribes a tribe of draconic orcs, which raised fire drakes as guardians and several commanders, mostly orcish or ogrish variants.
The Wyrmsmoke cell operated out of the citadel.
