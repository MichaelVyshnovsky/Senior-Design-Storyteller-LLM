        "mainbody": "The '''Skewered Dragon''' was a tavern in [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' the [[1491 DR|Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR]]. The clientele was primarily made up of dock workers that were suspicious of strangers.",
        "Location": "This establishment was on an alley that ran between [[Net Street (south)|Net Street]] and [[Fillet Lane]] in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]], just around the corner and a few doors down from the [[Old Xoblob Shop]].",
        "Structure": "The Skewered Dragon was in very  poor shape. Both front windows were broken and the roof groaned under the weight of a ship's anchor that punctured it."
