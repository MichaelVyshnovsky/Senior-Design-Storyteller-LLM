        "mainbody": "The Skewered Dragon was a tavern in Waterdeep circa the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR. The clientele was primarily made up of dock workers that were suspicious of strangers.\nThis establishment was on an alley that ran between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, just around the corner and a few doors down from the Old Xoblob Shop.\nThe Skewered Dragon was in very  poor shape. Both front windows were broken and the roof groaned under the weight of a ships anchor that punctured it."
