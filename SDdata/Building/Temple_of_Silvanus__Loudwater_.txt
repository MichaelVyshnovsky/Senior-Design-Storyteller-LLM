The '''Temple of Silvanus''' was a place of worship in [[Loudwater]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] that was sacred to [[Silvanus]], the [[god]] of nature.

==Location==
It was on the eastern edge of town and had a small hedge that served to separate it from the other buildings around it.

==Structure==
The temple walls towered over the surrounding town, and a spire rose a full {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} above the ground. Vines wound up the sides of the building. A large archway marked the main entrance, above which was Silvanus's symbol&mdash;an [[oak]] leaf&mdash;which glowed brightly with green light.

==Interior==
One massive room dominated the inside of the temple, which contained its own grassy hill atop which a circle of trees grew. The walls and ceiling were painted to look like the sky, and a gentle breeze eternally blew through the room, which gave it a calm and quiet ambiance.

==Activities==
The temple was holy ground of Silvanus, although followers of all peaceful faiths were welcomed. The temple offered healing and guidance to visitors.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the temple was headed by [[Griffon (person)|Brother Griffon]], who could be found there at dawn and dusk each day.
