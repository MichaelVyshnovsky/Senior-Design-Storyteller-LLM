The Temple of Silvanus was a place of worship in Loudwater in the late 15 century DR that was sacred to Silvanus, the god of nature.
It was on the eastern edge of town and had a small hedge that served to separate it from the other buildings around it.
The temple walls towered over the surrounding town, and a spire rose a full  above the ground. Vines wound up the sides of the building. A large archway marked the main entrance, above which was Silvanuss symbol&mdashan oak leaf&mdashwhich glowed brightly with green light.
One massive room dominated the inside of the temple, which contained its own grassy hill atop which a circle of trees grew. The walls and ceiling were painted to look like the sky, and a gentle breeze eternally blew through the room, which gave it a calm and quiet ambiance.
The temple was holy ground of Silvanus, although followers of all peaceful faiths were welcomed. The temple offered healing and guidance to visitors.
As of the , the temple was headed by Brother Griffon, who could be found there at dawn and dusk each day.
