Mad Melyrks was an outfitting supply store in Thentia in 1367 DR.
The shop was on a main intersection in southern Thentia, just down the road from the docks.
Mad Melyrks offered a wide range of new and used equipment at bargain prices, buying, selling and trading as needed. The proprietor, Melyrk Rubyripper, was exceptionally good at determining the value of goods, and enjoyed haggling for fun.
