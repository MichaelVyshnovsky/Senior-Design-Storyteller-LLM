        "mainbody": "'''Keir's Warehouse''' was a warehouse in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The warehouse was a two-story structure in poor condition. The owner of the warehouse, [[Kerr Halfhand]], has showed little interest in maintaining the building, leaving it in a state of disrepair. The warehouse was known for its leaky roof, pervasive mold, and [[rat]] infestations.",
        "Description": "The warehouse was a last resort for clients with limited means or unwilling to pay higher fees elsewhere. Storing goods at Keir's Warehouse carried a significant risk: items kept here had a risk of being damaged by mold, mildew, or fungus, or of being consumed by rats. Consequently, clients often found their goods spoiled or otherwise degraded, leading many to regret choosing this poorly maintained facility for storage."
