The '''Evermoors cemetery''' was a burial ground used by the [[Uthgardt]] [[Elk tribe]] for the fallen of the [[Battle of the Evermoors]], which was fought ''circa'' [[1400 DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group="note">The name of this site is unknown in both the ''Honor Among Thieves'' movie and novelization.

==Location==
It lay on the [[Evermoors]] in the [[Savage Frontier]], on the battlefield itself, and somewhere south of [[Nesmé]].

==Description==
It was a simple field of roughly hewn stone markers daubed with markings. Each indicated individual graves and coffins.

==History==
[[File:Evermoors cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Grave-digging for kicks and giggles.'']]
A century after the battle, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the bodies of these fallen warriors were exhumed by [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Simon Aumar]], [[Doric]], and [[Holga Kilgore]]—a member of the Elk tribe herself, so presumably it was not a complete desecration. They used Simon's ''[[deathly token]]'' to [[speak with dead|speak with the dead]] in order to learn the fate of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]''. The eternal rest of [[Stanhard Grimwulf]], [[Toke Horgath]], [[Sven Salafin]], [[Ven Salafin]], and others were all disturbed for the sake of a few questions, mistaken identities, and misused spellcasting.
