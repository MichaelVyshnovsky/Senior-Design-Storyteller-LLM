The manor had floods of laid tiles and columns scattered around the manse. It was well furnished, with vases, bookcases, fireplaces, and even a [[harpsichord]] in the foyer by the entrance, that, when a certain melody was played, opened a secret passage to Lady Bloodmire's underground laboratories. It had three staircases that led to a hallway and several other rooms. In the late 14{{th}} century DR, it was inhabited by creatures such as [[demon]] [[dog]]s that inflicted deadly [[poison]], and shambling stitched together dead creatures. The building also had a cellar full of reanimated [[skeleton]]s and [[spider]]s and a vermin-infested attic used for storage.
