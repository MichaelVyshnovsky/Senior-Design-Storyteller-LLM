The manor had floods of laid tiles and columns scattered around the manse. It was well furnished, with vases, bookcases, fireplaces, and even a harpsichord in the foyer by the entrance, that, when a certain melody was played, opened a secret passage to Lady Bloodmires underground laboratories. It had three staircases that led to a hallway and several other rooms. In the late 14 century DR, it was inhabited by creatures such as demon dogs that inflicted deadly poison, and shambling stitched together dead creatures. The building also had a cellar full of reanimated skeletons and spiders and a vermin-infested attic used for storage.
In the late 14 century DR, the Bloodmire Manor was investigated by a group of six heroes, tasked with investigating mysterious disappearances across Baldurs Gate. The heroes discovered the manor filled with monstrosities menacing the staff and servants. Subsequently, the group confronted the mistress of the manor â€“ Lady Luvia Bloodmire, after slaying her stick together cerberus-like monster she called Atrocius.
