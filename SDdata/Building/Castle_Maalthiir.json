        "mainbody": "astle Maalthiir, also known as Vultureroost, was an imposing structure overlooking the city of Hillsfar.\nThe castle sat on the high ground in the very center of the city.\nA vast network of catacombs honeycombed the area beneath the castle. Maalthiir used these chambers to host lavish parties where less acceptable forms of entertainment were offered.\nIn addition to Maalthiir, the castle housed 32 of his elite guards as well as any honored guests or associates.\nThe castle was accessible by a single gate that was well-guarded, making the structure practically impregnable. Maalthiir could call upon an additional force of a thousand Red Plumes housed in an adjacent barracks."
