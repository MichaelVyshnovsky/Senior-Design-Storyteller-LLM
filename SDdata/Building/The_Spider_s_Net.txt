'''The Spider's Net''' was an expensive tavern located in [[Sloopdilmonpolop]].
==Description==
The tavern was popular with the [[drow]] caravans that frequented the settlement. As a result, the tavern's menu was designed around the drow palate and consisted entirely of seafood. A salty wine, made from the waters of the [[River of Brine]] mixed with fish oil and the juice from fermented mushrooms, was the house specialty.
