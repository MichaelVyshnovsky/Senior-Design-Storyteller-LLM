        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "All furniture inside the hall was sized for giants and largely constructed from stone. Much of the furniture was crude in construction, consisting of a stone slab with wooden legs. There was a number of hearths to cook from and cooking pots that were earthenware. Between the hearths were stacked bunks{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|19}} to pull out for sleeping.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|24}}\n\nThe rear width of the building was taken up by six personal rooms, one of which was reserved for his friend [[Habrok Icecaster]]. Brimir's own room farthest back from the front hall and the largest, measuring {{SI|40|ft}} wide and {{SI|100|ft}} in length.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|20}} The building also had a cellar where kegs of [[beer]] were kept. The building's proprietor was said to hibernate atop these kegs during the winter season."

        "Defenses": "There was usually two giants stationed at the hall's front gate, one at each of the side gates, and one on the roof's flat apex. The guards rotated shifts every three hours.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|23}}\n\nThe sign above the front door had a ward cast on it, similar to a ''[[glyph of warding]]'', that covered the entire building and alerted Brimir whenever someone uninvited entered or left the building. Disabling the ward required [[dispel magic|dispelling the magic]] on the sign and then removing the axe.",
        "Atmosphere": "Okalnir maintained a raucous atmosphere during the active summer season, though was almost entirely deserted during winters. It attracted crowds of giants interested in wrestling, boasting, and drinking themselves senseless.{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21}}\n\nAbove all, the giant enclave valued personal freedom. It was acceptable to hang on to one's weapons, though it was considered rude to a hostile degree for guests to wear armor while inside the hall. It was expected of the guests that if an attack was made upon the hall, they would be called upon to help defend it.",
        "Services": "From dusk to an hour after midnight, a nightly feast was held in the hall{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|20}}",
        "Inhabitants": "The hall was operated by an old [[frost giant]] by the name of [[Brimir]], who was a member of the planar faction known as the [[Ring-Givers]] and consequently a very generous man, as well as a famous brewer among the giants. Any visiting guess was free to stay the night in his hall, which usually occured after the nightly feast.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|22,24}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] on the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]] journeyed to Jotunheim in search of the legendary [[Well of Mimir]] so they could learn how to destroy a powerful [[githyanki]] artifact known only as the ''[[Great Machine]]''. While on their journey they potentially encountered Okalnir, though sources differed on why this came about and how it went.\n\nSome sources spoke of them coming as honored guests of Habrok Icecaster, having proven their worth to him and his friends by hunting a [[bulette]]. The adventurers joined the giants in their nightly feast, where the thighs bones of the bulette they had killed earlier that day were cracked open and roasted. Before the feast began proper, Brimir stood and formally welcomed the party, extending his hospitality and speaking of their courage in the face of battle against the creature, garnering cheer from the assembly of giants. When dinner began to wind down Habrok would tell everyone of how he met the party and of how the bulette hunt began, garnering further applause from the crowd. Brimir then invited the adventurers to tell the story of the hunt themselves, casting ''[[tongues]]'' on them so that all assembled would be able to understand.\n\nAnother version of events spoke of the giants gathered in Okalnir feeling indifferent towards the guests, inspiring Brimir to wager a contest of four tests for the adventurers before dinner - eating, drinking, running, and wrestling. He was even willing to wager three [[magic item]]s if they would wager three comparably permanent or major charged items. The items he wagered included a ''[[Svartalfheim cloak]]'', a ''[[horn of Valhalla]]'',{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21-22}} and a great war [[maul]] known as ''[[Grungir's hammer]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|21,25,36}} He also offered a makeshift ''belt of giant strength'', made from a strip of leather from his own belt and a bullete's tooth as the clasp.\n\nIn eating the adventurers faced off against the [[fire giant]] [[Logi]] and had to reach the middle of a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} trencher of stew. In drinking they faced no one, but had to drink alcohol from a massive horn as fast as they could. In running they face the young giant [[Hugi]] and had to make it to the far end of the hall. Finally, in wrestling they faced Brimir's old mother [[Elli]], as the giants felt any other competitor would make things unfair.\n\nRegardless of which of those versions of events occurred, the night in the hall ended with all retiring to bed. On the following day, Brimir treated the adventurers to a breakfast of [[porridge]] before sending them out in the direction of Mimir's Well.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Three Coins in a Well|22}}\n\nA third version of events spoke of the adventurers sneaking into Brimirâ€™s hall on behalf of [[Torheim]], a [[proxy]] of [[Thor]], to steal a [[deva]] feather that Brimir owned and kept within a clay jar. Torheim desired the feather so he could more easily track down the deva it came from, wanting to rescue them from their imprisonment in the massive city of [[Utgard]]."
