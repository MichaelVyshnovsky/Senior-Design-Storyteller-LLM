        "Location": "The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Malar (Bezantur)|Temple of Malar]], the [[Temple of Shar (Bezantur)|Temple of Shar]], the [[Temple of Lliira (Bezantur)|Temple of Lliira]], the [[Temple of Helm (Bezantur)|Temple of Helm]], and the [[Temple of Umberlee (Bezantur)|Temple of Umberlee]].",
        "Structure": "It was a circular, white [[marble]] building with a colonnade.",
        "Interior": "The temple was primarily a library, boasting an extensive collection on topics ranging from history and religion to philosophy and science.",
        "Activities": "The local congregation was so small that it almost did not warrant a formal place of worship, however the [[church of Oghma]] maintained the temple in order to grow their knowledge about Thayan society.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Many supposed that the library contained tomes on the topics of [[magic]] and spellcasting, topics banned by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. If these rumors were ever proven to be true, the Red Wizards would have immediately sacked the temple and killed all inhabitants."
