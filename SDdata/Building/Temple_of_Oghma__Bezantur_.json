        "mainbody": "The Temple of Oghma in Bezantur, Thay was a place of worship dedicated to Oghma.\nThe temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Malar, the Temple of Shar, the Temple of Lliira, the Temple of Helm, and the Temple of Umberlee.\nIt was a circular, white marble building with a colonnade.\nThe temple was primarily a library, boasting an extensive collection on topics ranging from history and religion to philosophy and science.\nThe local congregation was so small that it almost did not warrant a formal place of worship, however the church of Oghma maintained the temple in order to grow their knowledge about Thayan society.\nMany supposed that the library contained tomes on the topics of magic and spellcasting, topics banned by the Red Wizards of Thay. If these rumors were ever proven to be true, the Red Wizards would have immediately sacked the temple and killed all inhabitants."
