        "mainbody": "during Karsuss Folly\nIoulaum Industries was a Netherese company that was responsible for the research and creation of mythallars, and had locations in Eileanar and other enclaves.\nIoulaum himself had little input on his business, as he was personally focused on his longevity spell, the threat of the phaerimms, and various other magical studies. He occasionally visited his Karsus Enclave branch in order to pick up a specialized magical component or chatting with the site administrator Ghazzalee, who oversaw the other managers. Fabbra was responsible for finding and verifying potential customers, ensuring that they could both pay the high prices and werent a threat to Netheril. Ryckaert headed the research-and-development team, which largely involved guiding the various magical misfits, eccentrics, and lunatics through mythallar-related projects. Finally, Theobald was in charge of transporting finished products to customers, which required extremely experienced and trustworthy guards to oversee shipments until they reached their destination."
