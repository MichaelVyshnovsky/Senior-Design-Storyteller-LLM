        "Services": "[[Ioulaum]] himself had little input on his business, as he was personally focused on his ''[[Ioulaum's longevity|longevity spell]]'', the threat of the [[phaerimm]]s, and various other magical studies. He occasionally visited his Karsus Enclave branch in order to pick up a specialized magical component or chatting with the site administrator [[Ghazzalee]], who oversaw the other managers. [[Fabbra]] was responsible for finding and verifying potential customers, ensuring that they could both pay the high prices and weren't a threat to [[Netheril]]. [[Ryckaert]] headed the research-and-development team, which largely involved guiding the various magical misfits, eccentrics, and lunatics through ''mythallar''-related projects. Finally, [[Theobald]] was in charge of transporting finished products to customers, which required extremely experienced and trustworthy guards to oversee shipments until they reached their destination."
