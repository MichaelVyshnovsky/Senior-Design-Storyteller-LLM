The Drovers Cup was a tavern in the town of Llorkh in the 1360s DR.
It opened some time after the Zhentarim takeover of Llorkh in 1357 DR. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly taverns. The Drovers Cup was in business by 1366 DR and through 1370 DR.
The travelogue writer Volothamp Geddarm presumed it to be a pretty poor place, but hadnt been able to visit to judge.
