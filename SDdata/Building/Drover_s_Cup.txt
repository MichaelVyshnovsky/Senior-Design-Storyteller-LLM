'''The Drover's Cup''' was a tavern in the town of [[Llorkh]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==History==
It opened some time after the [[Zhentarim]] takeover of Llorkh in [[1357 DR]]. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly taverns. The Drover's Cup was in business by [[1366 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
The travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] presumed it to be a pretty poor place, but hadn't been able to visit to judge.
