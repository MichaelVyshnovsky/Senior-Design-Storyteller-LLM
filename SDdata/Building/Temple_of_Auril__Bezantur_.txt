The '''Temple of Auril''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Auril]] within the [[Thay]]an city of [[Bezantur]].

==Structure==
This temple was a rather small, domed structure that was white in color.

==Activities==
The small but fervent congregation was known to be constantly warning other Thayans about the inevitable coming of terrible winters. They believed that Auril would soon ally with other [[evil]] [[deities]] to drive away more [[good]]ly gods like [[Chauntea]], [[Mystra]], and [[Tyr]].

==History==
Worship of Auril&mdash;as with most of the [[Gods of Fury]] save for [[Malar]]&mdash;was not popular in Thay prior to the [[Time of Troubles]].<ref name=DotRW-p50">
