        "mainbody": "'''Maskado's Maps & Legends''' was a bookshop in [[Neverwinter]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its owner was the mysterious [[Maskado]].",
        "Location": "It was one of a number of other booksellers, bookbinders, and scribes on a winding street running southeast of the [[House of Knowledge (Neverwinter)|House of Knowledge]], in the [[City Core (Neverwinter)|City Core]] district.",
        "Services": "Among these, Maskado's dealt specially in maps, records, and information concerned with exploration of the [[North]], such as trails, uncommon and secret routes, and treasure tales.\n\nSimple [[map]]s or scraps of writing with information sold at Maskado's had a cost of 100 [[gp]], while more detailed and accurate maps and treasure maps could cost twice as much. However, Maskado purchased such things from adventures for far less."
