        "mainbody": "askados Maps & Legends was a bookshop in Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Its owner was the mysterious Maskado.\nIt was one of a number of other booksellers, bookbinders, and scribes on a winding street running southeast of the House of Knowledge, in the City Core district.\nAmong these, Maskados dealt specially in maps, records, and information concerned with exploration of the North, such as trails, uncommon and secret routes, and treasure tales.\nSimple maps or scraps of writing with information sold at Maskados had a cost of 100 gp, while more detailed and accurate maps and treasure maps could cost twice as much. However, Maskado purchased such things from adventures for far less."
