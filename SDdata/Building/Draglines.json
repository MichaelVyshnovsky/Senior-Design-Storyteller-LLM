        "mainbody": "The '''Draglines''' was a business in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The Draglines was a two-story building in fair condition.",
        "Services": "The Draglines specialized in the repair and refitting of damaged vessels captured by the [[pirate]]s of Skullport. Each year, numerous wealthy merchant ships were captured by these pirates, disappearing with their cargo, crew, and all evidence of their fate. The pirates often enslaved or killed the crew and sold the ship in distant ports. However, when a vessel was severely damaged in combat, it required significant restoration to be seaworthy once more. The Draglines provided such high-quality repairs, a service critical to returning these prized captures to profitable use.",
        "Inhabitants": "For nearly thirty years, [[Helgar Hoaraxe]], a seasoned seafarer, has operated this business. Helgar, once a sailor himself, built his livelihood on refitting these damaged prizes, accepting a portion of the loot as payment for his services. In cases where no loot was available, Helgar offered his expertise at standard market rates. When demand for repairs was low, he and his five-man crew hired themselves out as ship carpenters and sailmasters, supporting captains in need of skilled hands."
