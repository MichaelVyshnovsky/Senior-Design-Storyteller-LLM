        "mainbody": "The '''Shrine of the Tear''' was the secret hiding place of the ''[[Tear of Selûne]]'' between the [[Dawn Cataclysm]] and the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], after which the shrine was opened by [[adventurer]]s and the ''Tear'' fell into the hands of the [[Zhentarim]].",
        "Description": "The sole purpose of the shrine was to safely conceal the ''Tear of Selûne''. It had no openings or obvious doors, and was carved from a single chunk of rock into a clean oval covered in intricate engravings and glyphs. When bathed in [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne's]] moonlight, a large door with a single keyhole appeared. The interior of the shrine was large enough to hold six people, but the only thing inside was a small, velvet-lined silver chest that contained the ''Tear''.",
        "Geography": "The shrine was located in the West Galena Mountains on the [[Vaasa]]n side, southwest of [[Mirror Lake]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} It was hidden in a small valley that was difficult to find without guidance from the goddess Selûne herself.",
        "History": "The shrine was built by [[Church of Selûne|Selûnite]] [[priestess]]es from the [[Moonsea]] to conceal and protect the ''Tear of Selûne'' after it fell to [[Toril]] following the Dawn Cataclysm. The Selûnites retrieved the sacred meteorite from its resting place in [[Thar]] and used a shard of it to craft the ''[[Staff of the Tear]]'', which channeled Selûne's power and guided them north to a concealed site in Vaasa where they constructed the shrine. The key to the shrine's secret door was crafted from fragments of [[iron]] that were said to have fallen alongside the ''Tear''.\n\nTo protect the ''Tear'' further, the Selûnites magically divided the shrine's key into two pieces, one of which was sent back to a Selûnite temple in the Moonsea for safekeeping while the other was to stay with the shrine's guardians. The first half of the key was stolen by bandits during its journey southward, and the other half was stolen around the same time by a band of [[ogres]] who raided the site of the shrine shortly after its completion.\n\nFor many years, Selûnite priestesses stood vigil over the Shrine of the Tear, and the ''Staff of the Tear'' was held by specially selected priestesses of the faith. By the mid–14{{th}} century DR, these priestesses had left or been driven away from the shrine, the ''Staff'' was lost in the [[Marsh of Chelimber]], and both halves of the key remained missing.\n\nThe shrine was rediscovered and opened in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}. An [[Moon elf|elven]] cleric of Selûne named [[Esta Starchild]] received a vision from the goddess guiding her to the ''Staff of the Tear'', which in turn led her and her party, known as the [[Seekers]], to find both keys and to retrieve the ''Tear'' itself from within the Shrine. However, the party was tracked by a force of [[Zhentarim]] agents as well as a group of [[orcs]]. These two forces fought a bloody skirmish at the entrance to the valley, trapping the Seekers inside. After the Zhentarim defeated the orcs, they attacked the Seekers, killing at least two of them and capturing the rest to take back to [[Zhentil Keep]] along with the ''Tear''."
