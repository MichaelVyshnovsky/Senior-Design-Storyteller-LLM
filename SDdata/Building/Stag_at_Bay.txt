The '''Stag at Bay''' was a tavern located near the [[Silver Moon Gate]] within [[Everlund]].

==Patronage==
The Stag tended to the needs of hunters and travelers of the region, as it provided them with a meeting area where they could boast about their adventures in the [[Savage Frontier]].

==History==
The tavern was named after the tapestry of an [[elf|elven]] hunt that hung on the wall.
