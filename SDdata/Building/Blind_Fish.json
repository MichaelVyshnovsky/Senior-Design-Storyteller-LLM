        "mainbody": "The Blind Fish was a rowdy tavern close to the edge of Sarguth in the Dredge area of Skullport.\nThe Blind Fish served strong alcohol and food. The tavern was well-furnished and filled with neer-do-wells who often started fights and were ready to gut someone for coin.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the bartender of Blind Fish was an aging male orc with a long white beard and an eyepatch.\nSometime in the 1490s DR, a halfling thief, and an unwilling agent of Laeral Silverhand found himself in the tavern Blind Fish on his quest to recover the missing baby griffon stoled from the Open Lord by the Xanathar. Most regulars of the tavern were loyal to the master of the Thieves Guild and attacked the halfling once he started asking questions about the guild. Fundunsun, Heleen, and Ssslasssh were part of the scuffle."
