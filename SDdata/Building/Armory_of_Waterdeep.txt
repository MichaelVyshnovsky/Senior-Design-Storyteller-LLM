This building was the armory of the City Guard in Waterdeep.
The armory stood along Trollkill Street in the Sea Ward, south of North Tower and the Sated Satyr.
This structure stood three stories tall and was directly connected to the city walls that separated Sea Ward from the Field Ward.
Though this armory was primarily under the purview of the City Guard, the City Watch also had access to it.
