'''Mresker's Hide''' was a harbor on the isle of [[Thelve]] in [[Sea of Swords]], just off the shores of [[Candlekeep]].

==Location==
Mresker's Hide was located in the bay shaped like a half-moon on Thelve's southern half of the eastern shores. The harbor was facing the waters of the [[Racewind Passage]] and [[Skoond's Run]]. Mresker's Hide was likely left over from a [[gnome|gnomish]] tribe that once inhabited the island but was long-exterminated by the [[Twilight Three]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
