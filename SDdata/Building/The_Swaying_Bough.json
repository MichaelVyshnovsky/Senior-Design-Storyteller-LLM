        "mainbody": "The Swaying Bough was an inn built entirely around the upper branches of a giant oak tree in Elventree around 1367 DR.\nThe Swaying Bough was the finest inn in Elventree. The roof and walls of the inn were made from leaves and limbs, but the rest of the structure resembled any inn found on ground level. The gentle swaying of the trees during strong winds reminded customers that the structure was high off the ground.\nAll were welcome at the Swaying Bough. Locals enjoyed frequenting the inn at night to eat and drink."
