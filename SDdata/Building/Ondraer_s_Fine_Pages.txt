'''Ondraer's Fine Pages''' was an expensive bookstore in [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The shop was located in Berdusk along the [[Gollahaer]], the shorter street that crossed the [[Clearspring]]. A powerful fire-proofing [[enchantment]] spread out from the shop, strong enough to snuff out [[Hooded lantern|lanterns]] and [[torch]]es as individuals approached the entrance.

==Services==
Ondraer sold a variety of [[book]]s, as well as a large selection of writing materials. These included blank books, [[scroll]]s, frames of [[vellum]], and reams of parchment. The materials used in binding the books were always expensive, some even covered in [[dragon]]skin.

==History==
The shop was opened by [[Ondraeas Ondraer]], who left much of the work in running the business to his three sons and two apprentices. The high-quality and professional nature of the store drew the attention of many mages, priests, scribes, and cartographers, who visited or were sent to Ondraer's Fine Pages just to find the specific items they needed for their work.

Ondraer spent most of his time in the various taverns in Berdusk.
