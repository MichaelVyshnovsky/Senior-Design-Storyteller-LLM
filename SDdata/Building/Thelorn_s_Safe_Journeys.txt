Thelorns Safe Journeys was a wagonworks shop owned by the ex-mercenary Thelorn in the town of Red Larch.
Thelorns Safe Journeys usually had at least a dozen high-quality wagons in stock, which cost about 150 gold pieces. These ready-made wagons were stored out of the weather in a large shed. The establishment would take custom orders, but required a tenday to complete each special order.
Thelorns Safe Journeys once crafted a seaworthy sloop that also had wheels. It took a whole month to complete and Thelorn charged 4,500 gold pieces for it.
