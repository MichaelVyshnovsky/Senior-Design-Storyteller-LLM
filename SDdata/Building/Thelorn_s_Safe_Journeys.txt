'''Thelorn's Safe Journeys''' was a [[wagon]]works shop owned by the ex-mercenary [[Thelorn]] in the town of [[Red Larch]].

==Services==
Thelorn's Safe Journeys usually had at least a dozen high-quality wagons in stock, which cost about 150 [[gold piece]]s. These ready-made wagons were stored out of the weather in a large shed. The establishment would take custom orders, but required a [[tenday]] to complete each special order.

Thelorn's Safe Journeys once crafted a seaworthy [[sloop]] that also had wheels. It took a whole month to complete and Thelorn charged 4,500 gold pieces for it.
