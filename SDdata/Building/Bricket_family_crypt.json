        "mainbody": "Bricket family crypt was one of the bigger underground tombs located in the Daggerford Graveyard circa 1372 DR.\nThe crypt was located to the east from the mausoleum of Daggerford Graveyard, Eastern Farmlands, across from a lush apple orchard. The crypts entrance led downstairs to the spacious interior. In front of the heavy tomb door, a stone marker with the familys name could be found.\nThe crypts subterranean hall was a big square room. The center of the structure was illuminated with a lit brazier atop a mosaic floor assembled to resemble a sun. The walls of the crypt held burial niches while four grand decorated sarcophagi stood across from each wall. Two of the smaller and less decorated sarcophagi stood on each side of the bigger ones.\nElveronne Brickets sarcophagus, after his burial in 1372 DR, was inscribed with \"Whose home was at his country house, but whose heart lay in the forest.\"\nThe Bricket family crypt was the final resting place for many generations of the Brickets of Daggerford. The crypts peace was disturbed in 1372 DR when Elveronne Bricket rose up, past his interring ceremony, opened the sarcophagus, and shambled away. The restless vengefulness of the deceased birthed the undead, who was murdered by his seeming kingly sisters Alicine and Muriel Bricket. The Funeral Director and mortician, at the time, Moris Olgrund was shocked by the loss of one of his corpses, especially after the burial. In fears of damaging his familys reputation, Moris asked the Hero of Daggerford to track the vengeful undead and send the spirit into the realms of Kelemvor."
