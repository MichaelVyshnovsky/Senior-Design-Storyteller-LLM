'''Danthelon's Dancing Axe''' was a general store located on [[Wyrm's Crossing]] in [[Baldur's Gate]]. It sold good quality secondhand wares, from [[pot]]s and [[pan]]s to [[rope]], [[armor]], and [[weapon]]s.

==Description==
The building's main floor was the shop, just past the main entrance that faced the center of Wyrm's Crossing. The room was filled with shelves and displays of various types and sizes. Visitors could see [[weapon]]s hung on the walls, [[armor]] and other more expensive items locks in display cages and cases, bookshelves filled with [[book]]s, and a large taxidermy [[bear]].

==Services==
Danthelon's sold second-hand goods, from armor and weapons, to mundane coils of [[rope]]. The shop also carried ever-popular limited edition adventuring starter packs. Occasionally, some more curious items found a way into the dwarf's inventory, including ''[[gauntlets of the warmaster]]'', ''[[horns of the berserker]]'', ''[[snow-dusted monastery gloves]]'', ''[[cloaks of displacement]]'', and unique items such as the ''[[Garb of the Land and Sky]]'', the ''[[Blightbringer]]'' and a ''[[harmonic dueller]]''.

==Inhabitants==
It was run by [[Entharl Danthelon]], the [[shield dwarf]] proprietor who claimed to be a retired adventurer. ''Circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Danthelon employed a duo of [[half-orc]]ish bodyguardsâ€“[[Somi]] and his brother. Secretly, Entharl Danthelon offered his shop's cellar to the local [[Harper]] cell to be used a safehouse and the bodyguards ensured no city guard nor [[steel watcher]] bothered the "guests." The [[High Harper]] [[Jaheira]] was one of the agents who used the safehouse and was well accounted with the Dancing Axe's proprietor.

==Rumors & Legends==
The shop earned its name from a "magically-floating [[axe]]" that protected the premises at night. According to Danthelon himself, the axe was a gift from a particularly grateful [[elven]] princess.

In fact, the "axe" was actually a tamed [[stirge]] that had been modified with [[illusion]]-magic by Yssra.
