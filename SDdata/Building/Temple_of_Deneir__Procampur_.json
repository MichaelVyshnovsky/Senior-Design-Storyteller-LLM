        "mainbody": "A '''temple of [[Deneir]]''' lay in the Temple District of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]].<ref group=\"note\">No canonical name has been given for this temple. The title of \"temple of Deneir\" has been adopted based on text and descriptions.",
        "Structure & Interior": "The temple structure included a main hall. The front entrance consisted of a portico with a very loud doorknocker, attended to by a [[clay golem]] porter. There was also a small side-door. Inside the hall was a shrine to Deneir, and upon the altar were arranged a thousand votive candles. \n\nIt also had a tower, accessed with a winding staircase, with small rooms with single small windows. They had good views over the city of Procampur. These rooms were inhabited by priests and guests of the temple.\n\nAttached to the temple were a number of secure vaults, for the storage of [[book]]s and for working on projects such as the creation of [[golem]]s.",
        "History": "At some point, the [[Hierarch]] of the temple commanded the scholar-monk [[Vilhiard]] of Procampur to set out on a number of lengthy and hazardous journeys into the East. The Hierarch was, in turn, thought to have received commands from the [[Thultyrl]] of Procampur. The Thultyrl granted Vilhiard a supply of wealth for expenses. Although he later wrote of his travels in ''[[A Discovery of the World]]'', Vilhiard remained quiet about the actual purposes of these missions. His writings became the basis for the majority of [[Faerûn]]ian scholarly knowledge about the [[Hordelands]] and the [[Tuigan]] people.\n\nFollowing the rise and fall of the [[Tuigan Horde]] under [[Yamun Khahan]] in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], [[Prelate]] [[Wenslan Amthur]] of the temple of Deneir allowed a historian researching the events to examine the temple's complete manuscript of Vilhiard's ''A Discovery of the World''. This helped him understand Tuigan life and set events in their proper context.\n\nLater, the temple invited [[Koja]] of [[Khazari]], once scribe to Yamun Khahan and then living in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]], as a guest of King [[Azoun IV]], to join them in Procampur. By the [[1362 DR|Year of the Helm, 1362 DR]], Koja was living at the temple of Deneir. The priests appointed [[Foxe]] to be his secretary and aide while he was there. Here, Koja worked on his next book, ''[[A History of the Tuigan]]''.\n\nAround this time, Sister [[Deara]] fashioned a [[clay golem]], intending that it be a perfect scribe. In one test in the temple vaults, it rammed a [[quill]] through a wooden writing desk, and smashed the desk. It was promptly put into service as a porter and doorman at the temple.\n\nAlthough the temple was willing to make and send copies of ''A History of the Tuigan'' to every of temple of Deneir in the [[Heartland]]s, Koja sought to have his work mass-published and widely circulated, to present an honest version to the public, rather than be buried in temple libraries. His efforts to raise funds culminated in the god Deneir himself appearing before Koja outside the temple. Deneir granted him the necessary funds and bade him stay in Faerûn to educate people. Later, Koja paid to have his book [[printing press|printed]] before he and Foxe planned to travel to [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The high priest of the temple was called a [[hierarch]],''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' page 54 confirms that a [[high scrivener]] is the leader of a temple of [[Deneir]], but the precise roles of [[hierarch]] and [[prelate]], mentioned in ''[[The Horde]]'' and ''[[Horde Campaign]]'' respectively, are unclear. Given their respective importance, they are assumed to refer to the same position, but it is possible they represent different steps in a church hierarchy, or different structures of this hierarchy over time."
