        "Description": "The tavern's main clientele were [[human]]s and other [[humanoid]]s. The Pickled Platter was known for its cheap alcohol and served the usual [[Underdark]] fare, however the tavern did not sell seafood of any kind. A potent mead made from green mushrooms was the house specialty. Any individual who heavily imbibed the noxious drink was left in a daze for several days afterwards."
