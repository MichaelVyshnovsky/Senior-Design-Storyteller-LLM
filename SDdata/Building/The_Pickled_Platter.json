        "mainbody": "he Pickled Platter was an inexpensive tavern located in Sloopdilmonpolop.\nThe taverns main clientele were humans and other humanoids. The Pickled Platter was known for its cheap alcohol and served the usual Underdark fare, however the tavern did not sell seafood of any kind. A potent mead made from green mushrooms was the house specialty. Any individual who heavily imbibed the noxious drink was left in a daze for several days afterwards."
