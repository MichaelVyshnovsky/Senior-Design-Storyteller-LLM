        "mainbody": "century DR\nThe Crying Claw was one of the most popular taverns located not far from the waterfront in the Warehouse District of Arrabar.\nThe Crying Claws entrance was indicated by a huge hanging sign that depicted a single claw of a bird, and the name of the establishment was inspired by the squeaky sound of the sign, or the claw, made as it dangled over the entrance doors. The tavern was located to the east of the citys bay, and the wind always blew through the city streets from east to west, making the claw sign move and screech. The entrance to the establishment was facing to the northeast. The building itself stood on top of a steep hill that sloped towards the Dock District and the harbors of Arrabar.\nAs the entrance doors swung open, the Crying Claw welcomed its customers with a sizable taproom. The most popular spot inside the Crying Claw was its patio that was in use during warm months and good weather. A set of wide-arched doorways led to the outside part of the tavern. The patio effectively was a sprawling terrace that covered the slope of the hill where the tavern stood. The terrace effectively consisted of several tiled patios connected by ramps and stairs to one another. The entire space was filled with tables of various shapes and sizes, some under the open sky, while others â€“ under a wooden scaffolding. The scaffoldings were swathed in cheerfully-colored awnings.\nLike everywhere in Arrabar, the Crying Claws patios and taproom were filled with exotic tropical greenery, planters, and railings covered in vines. Greenery-wrapped trellises were used to divide patios into semi-private sections. The abundant vegetation made the Crying Claws patio look like a lush vineyard that stood in the middle of a metropolis.\nCrying Claw was a busy establishment that catered to Arrabarran middle class, especially popular among ship officers, adventurers, and sea-faring mercenaries, such as members of the Waukeenar Order of the Sapphire Crescent. The place was often packed with numerous servers moving through the busy patios between tables. The servers who worked at the Crying Claw all were physically fit as they had to run up and down countless stairs and ramps all through the night.\nSometime circa , the Crying Claw gained a new owner, a half-elven woman named Jenis Glowarm, who was rumored to be a member of Those Who Harp. Her management was so successful that the tavern saw significant quality improvements within a single year.\nOn Tarsakh 11 of the , shortly after the festival of the Spheres, Vambran Matrell, Adyan Mercatio, and Horial Rohden met up at the Crying Claw for a drink. The trios ship, the Ladys Favor, docked in Arrabar only a day prior. Since then, Vambran witnessed a murder by supposed members of the Municipal Guard of Arrabar of two commoners. Lieutenant Matrell asked two of his oldest friends to aid him in the investigation over several refreshing tankards of beer."
