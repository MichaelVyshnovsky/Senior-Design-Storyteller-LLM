        "mainbody": "'''Chemcheaux''' was a famous [[magic]]al item shop located within the [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood in the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. Its daily operations were run by [[Mortimer]], a [[Calimshan|Calishite]] [[wizard|mage]] and business partner to the renowned [[Prismal the Outrageous]].",
        "History": "Some time before [[1370 DR]], a sudden, violent explosion engulfed the shop. It was so large in force that it was visible from as far away as the nearby town of [[Mossbridges]]. Once the smoke cleared, it became evident that Mortimer, and at least one other clerk within the store, had completely disappeared. For years after this event, any [[spell]]s cast near the ruins of Chemcheaux, or the city block it had been located on, would produce [[wild magic|wild]] and unintended effects. \n\nEventually, the land where the famous shop stood came to be used by the city of Ravens Bluff. The bold and steadfast entrepreneur [[Veldarno Khalabari]] fulfilled his lifelong dream of building a club, the [[Raven's Glory]], where Chemcheaux once stood."
