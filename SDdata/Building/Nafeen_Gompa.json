        "Geography": "It stood in southern Tabot, amongst the jungles south of the [[Haraki Ridge]].",
        "History": "It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Nafeen.\n\nAround {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Nafeen and [[Zotung Gompa]]s and the other southern monasteries complained strenuously about the High Lord's tithings and adopted radical stances, thus paralyzing the yig-tsang (monk council) and presaging a separatist movement. It was even rumored they harbored Phen Do. He was in fact hidden in the mountains to the east of Nafeen.\n\nThat year, [[yeti]] emerged from the [[Wu Pi Te Shar]] mountains and raided Nafeen Gompa, killing 23 and causing great damage, triggering fears of another [[Kume Sa Yeti]]. The dzong-pon (sheriff) of [[Thok]] district organized a hunting expedition against them, distributing printed handbills around southwestern Tabot. Nafeen Gompa received an initial 25 volunteers from [[Eo'tzi Gompa]] for the expedition.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "[[Pang]], a [[monk]] of [[Pokarr Gompa]] was dismissive of Nafeen and Zotung Gompas, declaring they did not follow \"the true and holy laws of the High Lord\" as Pokarr did."
