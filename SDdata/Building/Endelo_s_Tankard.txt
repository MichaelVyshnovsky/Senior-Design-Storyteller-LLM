'''Endelo's Tankard''' was a low-end tavern located in the [[Silverscales]] neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its patrons were mainly impoverished sailors who couldn't afford to carouse in more lively establishments.

The tavern was located on the west side of [[Fishleap Lane]] within the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]].

==Description==
The dilapidated wooden bar had the atmosphere and accommodations of a set of abandoned ruins. It offered watery beer that could be conveniently evacuated into the bucket that was kept as a privy.
