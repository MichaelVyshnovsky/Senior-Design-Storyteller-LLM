Neversfall was a fortress in the wilds of Veldorn.

Neversfall comprised several buildings, most notably three towers, surrounded by a very skillfully made wall of large dark stones and strong mortar. The towers were made of the same stones, yet stood out slightly. The two smaller towers leaned into the central larger tower, where the fortresss magical defense was kept in the topmost room, which was sealed by magic.
The other buildings, of wood and stone, included barracks, prisons, normal housing, a chapel, and room for a market.
The overall design of the citadel was so that it could withstand a large assault from most adversaries with a small number of defenders.
