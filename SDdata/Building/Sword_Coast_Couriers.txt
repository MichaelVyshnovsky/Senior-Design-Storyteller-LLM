The '''Sword Coast Couriers''' was a courier, shipping, and postal agency that operated in the environs and within the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Rivington|Rivington]] neighborhood in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

The Sword Coast Couriers was located in the first building one faces when entering Rivington from the [[Wyrm's Crossing]] bridge. It was a two-storied building, with letters storage and pigeon aviary on the second floor and a fenced backyard used to house and train courier dogs.

==Services==
The agency offered services of postal deliveries, both letters and parcels, as well as delivery of rare and valuable items for unsavory individuals with enough [[coin]]. The deliveries were done via couriers accompanied by postal service [[dog]]s, and by carrier [[pigeon]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Danzo Arkwright]] worked as the postmaster of the Sword Coast Couriers. However, the postal services were unreliable as the region was affected by a looming threat of a war with the [[Cult of the Absolute]], which led to some of the couriers being killed, letters being undelivered, and the loss of courier dogs. Trying to deliver letters in a timely manner, Danzo employed a small flock of carrier pigeons; however, that also proved to be a challenge when something started killing the birds off, and more letters were undelivered, including Danzo's personal correspondence. The said correspondence was Danzo's communications with [[Roah Moonglow]], a [[Zhentarim]] cell's leader in Baldur's Gate. Danzo was to deliver an ''[[iron flask]]'' that was supposed to be smuggled into the city from the [[Waukeen's Rest]] Zhent cell for the [[Vanthampur]]s, and as that shipment was lost, the noble family was lost as a customer. Another letter was sent out to [[Gomwick]], one of Danzo's couriers, but the warning message never reached the man. Facing the lack of delivery birds, the Sword Coast Couriers posted an add searching for kindly bird breeder, bird catchers who could snatch pigeons, and people willing to sell any "half-able" pigeons, [[canaries]], [[finche]]s, [[parrot]]s, other household birds, as well as athletic [[chicken]]s, whose purchase and price were negotiable.

The reason for the pigeon mail disappearances was [[Tara]], a [[Waterdhavian]] [[tressym]], and a long-time companion of [[Gale Dekarios]]. The winged cat preyed on delicious pigeons and cared naught for the missing letters.

==Inhabitants==
Apart from Danzo Arkwright, the courier agency employed angry dog trainer [[Mar'hyah]], her aide, [[Dringo]], and [[Gomwick]] as one of its on-foot deliverymen. Animals that served the Sword Coast Couriers included dogs [[Scratch (dog)|Scratch]], [[Gustav]], and [[Zola]], and pigeons [[Commander Lightfeather]] and [[Beaky]] among others.
