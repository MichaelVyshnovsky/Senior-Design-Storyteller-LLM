        "mainbody": "The Shod Talon was a tavern and inn in the city of Ravens Bluff that catered to elves and half-elves.\nThis tavern stood along MacIntyre Path, in the Sixstar neighborhood of the citys Uptown District.\nThe Shod Talon was housed within an old stucco building with a slate roof, which had a  by  patio perched atop it. Outside the building was hung a sign depicting a roc with talons outstretched. Said talons on the sign were covered with steel.\nWithin the storage room of the building stood a spiral staircase that led up to the Shod Talons rooftop patio.\nThis establishment was a lively place of chatter, drink, and dancing for all manner of elves and half-elves. Humans and halflings that visited the tavern would find themselves tolerated, though not as comfortable as they would in other nearby establishments. However, the place was not nearly as prejudiced as the Ill Eagle Inn.\nThe prices of goods on offer at the Shod Talon were higher than some other establishments within the area, but by far not the highest. And with the quality of the food and drink on offer, very few saw fit to complain about these prices.\nDrinks\n Ale 4 sp\n beer 1 sp (for )\n Wine 12 sp to 1 gp\nEveningfeast\n Meals beef ribs 1 gp • beef steaks 2 gp • chicken eggs 5 cp • mutton 6 sp • roast chicken 8 sp • roast turkey 4 sp • vegetables 5 cp • venison 8 sp\nIn addition to food and drink, the Shod Talon offered lodgings in one of its ten rooms at a nightly cost of 1 to 5 gold pieces, usually offering this service to elves or anyone who couldnt or didnt wish to stay at one of the local inns for one reason or another.\nSometime prior to the ,Gateway to Ravens Bluff (p. 7) states that Charles OKane has been Mayor for 14 years, which tracks with the later article \"Pillars of Ravens Bluff\" in Polyhedron #147. It also states he is 48 years old, which conflicts with the \"Pillars\" article and is assumed to be an error. Voron Orama came to the city of Ravens Bluff in search of a relative. and rebuilt it.It is not stated when exactly Voron Orama bought the Shod Talon. It is stated in Gateway to Ravens Bluff that Gaolla Luathe had been working for the past 30 years, but its possible they could have been working there prior to Vorons purchase of the Shod Talon.\nThe Shod Talon was closed down for a time during the Three Women War, but reopened after its conclusion.\nThe tavern was lived in and operated by the moon elf Voron Orama."
