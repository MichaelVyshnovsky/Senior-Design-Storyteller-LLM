        "mainbody": "The School of the Mage of Shadowdale was a small school in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThis school was run by the foreign wizard Elfinster. Students accepted at the school could learn magical spells, or, if they lacked magical ability, they could learn to recognize a specific spell being cast based upon the casters gestures and speech.\nThough Elfinster could be quite eccentric, his prices were reasonable and he was a proficient teacher.\nScrolls could also be purchased here.\nElfinster owned and operated this school."
