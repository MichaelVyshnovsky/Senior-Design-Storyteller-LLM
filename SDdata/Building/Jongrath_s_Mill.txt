'''Jongrath's Mill''' was a [[gristmill|wheelmill]] in [[Tethyr]], known locally as '''Stump Hill''', owned and operated by [[Ilmurk Jongrath]]. On the property was the working mill, a cottage that could be rented, livestock, and a large [[horse]] stable. It was in operation around the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]{{Cite dragon/304/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Jongrath's Mill|78}}<ref group="note">The date is estimated from the fact that [[Marilyn Haresdown]], as Duchess of the Purple Marches, occasionally visited the Mill in disguise. She became Duchess in [[1369 DR]].

==Location==
Jongrath's Mill was located about a day's ride east of [[Krennasar]] in rural [[Bardshyr]] county in the Duchy of the [[Purple Marches]], [[Tethyr]]. 

==Structure==
There were three main buildings all surrounding a millrun where draft horses were harnessed to the spokes of a large wheel. The mill itself was tall enough to house the shaft-and-gear mechanism&mdash;a thick horizontal shaft made from tree trunks held up by tripods so the horses could walk beneath&mdash;that turned the millstone. There was also a secondary shaft that was used to pump water from a deep well. All doors and windows were adorned with "snap-traps" of Jongrath's own design to keep vermin from spoiling his grain and flour. Jongrath slept in the millhouse to guard his valuables and left the house available for renters.

The stables were large enough to hold a phalanx of draft horses and their winter fodder was kept on the second story. Plus, there were high rafters that anchored hoists and [[pulley]]s and served as a drying area for Jongrath's painted works (shields, carriage doors, ''etc.'').{{Cite dragon/304/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Jongrath's Mill|80}} The cottage was a modest two-story house with furnishings.

===Atmosphere===
Jongrath's holdings were mostly scrub land on which his livestock were free to roam. The borders were made of large stones and tree stumps, thus giving Jongrath's Mill the local name of Stump Hill. There was no running water.{{Cite dragon/304/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Jongrath's Mill|81}}

==Services==

In addition to making good money as a grain mill far from any river, Jongrath rented out the cottage to traveling merchants dealing in livestock (including his own), and hunters and falconers from around the Purple Marches, but mainly Krennasar.{{Cite dragon/304/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Jongrath's Mill|79}}

==Defenses==
There were no formal defenses other than Jongrath's considerable skill with a [[crossbow]].

==Rumors and Legends==
It was rumored that [[Ilmurk Jongrath]] was in possession of a powerful [[Shield of senses|magical shield]] that had belonged to a [[cleric]] who fell in battle before returning to claim her newly decorated property. It was said that Jongrath hid the shield well somewhere on his land and waited for her return.
