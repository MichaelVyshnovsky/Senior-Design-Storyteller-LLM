        "mainbody": "Fulgaths Caravan Supplies was a large shop in Dagger Falls. \nThe barnlike shop was a thick stone building with large twin doors.\nFulgaths was arrayed with a medley of goods and service. Anything a travelling merchant need on the open road was available here from saddlery or wainwright services to tools or containers. However all these useful provisions were priced at roughly twice the typical cost elsewhere.\nThe store was run by a cheerful yet shrewd rogue named Fulgath, who was known to \"get his price, one way or another.\" He was able to back this up by the constant demand for wagon wheels, chests, horse harnesses and other goods that Fulgath provided. \nAround 1368 DR, Fulgath faced competition and caused his business to dabble in more shady deals. \nCategoryShops\nCategoryOutfitter shops\nCategoryWainwright shops\nCategoryTack shops\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in Dagger Falls\nCategoryLocations in Daggerdale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nl9b8yqqauj1phodbmb6kvo9ljfgk8lo"
