Hawks Nest was a small watchtower near the top of the Silverymoon Pass.
Travelers on the road from Silverymoon to Sundabar were often pressed hard to reach the shelter of the watchtower before nightfall.
The watchtower was usually manned by a dozen Knights in Silver during the months when the Silverymoon Pass was in heavy use.
