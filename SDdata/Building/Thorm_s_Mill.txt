Thorms Mill was the only one of its kind in the city of Ashabenford, a bustling gristmill that processed wheat, oat and other grains from all around the Dalelands. Due to the fact the River Ashaba became very shallow near Elven Crossing further downstream, the mills owner Thorm Ubler was able to maintain a monopoly on milling within Mistledale. Thorm was known as a miserly man, and used his position to heavily overcharge the dalesfolk.
There were a number of attempts to build a rival mill on the river near the Yeven Trail, each of which have ended with fire or bandit raids.
