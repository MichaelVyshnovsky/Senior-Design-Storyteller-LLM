        "mainbody": "Lanternlighters was a shop in Skullport that sold lanterns. Located in the Dredge of the city, the establishment was owned and operated by Anderian Dusk, an elderly half-elf.\nWhile lanterns were readily available within the shop, oil was not offered by its proprietor. As the two items went hand-in-hand, any customers seeking lamp oil were referred by Anderian to the Overflowing Urn.\nThose who walked into Lanternlighters were unknowingly spied upon by the sea hags that dwelled within River Sargauth. This was accomplished by means of a magical amulet that Anderian Dusk wore around his neck, a service for which he was well-paid."
