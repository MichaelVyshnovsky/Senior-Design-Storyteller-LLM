The Tower of Swift Death was a temple dedicated to Cyric. It was formerly committed to Bhaal.
This fortress was located outside the tharch of Thay, Tyraturos.
The Tower of Swift Death hosted multiple trained murderers and priests. Such inhabitants were known to be recruited by the Red Wizards of Thay for specific missions.
Prior to 1370 DR, the tower fortress was one of the final temples of Bhaal, after Cyric assumed his portfolio during the Time of Troubles. As Bhaal became a dead power, Cyric provided the priests of the tower spells in the name of their former master. As of 1370 DR, the temple was run by Primate Oumrant Tsulkide and was funded by the Red Wizards of Thay. In such a year, the fortress converted to the worship of Cyric the Dark Sun.
