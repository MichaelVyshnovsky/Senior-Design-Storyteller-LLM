        "mainbody": "Bloomridge Park was a public park located in the Bloomridge neighborhood of the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nthumb|Bloomridge Park decorations.|380x380px\nBloomridge Park was a small park nestled against the Old Wall, just east of the Manor Gate.The city map in Baldurs Gate III is merely representative of a much larger Lower City. The name – Bloomridge Park implies it is located in the Bloomridge district. As such, the only point of reference that can be used in locating the park is the districts only gate, the Manor Gate. The Park had one main entrance – a large gate in the parks metal fence on the parks southwestern side. Another entrance, a smaller gate, was located on the eastern side with the groundskeepers quarters adjacent.\nThe park opened into a paved plaza with a statue of Balduran. It extended away from the main gate into a round risen area built around an old tree. Pathways extended away from the plaza with a gazebo to the left of the entrance, a small pond further in towards the Old Wall, and an area with wall-carved fountains straight across the main entrance at the Old Wall. The parks paths were decorated with statues carved by Stoney and Boney, two elementals from the Circus of the Last Days. The statues were \"A Tribute to Liberty.\"\nVarious medicinal plants and fungi could be found growing throughout the park, such as balsam, autumncrocus, swarming toadstools, weavemoss, mugwort, rogues morsels, belladonna, and others. Some of the trees in the park house honey-filled wild bee combs.\nThe park was open to public and was maintained by a groundkeeper who was responsible for clearing paths off fallen branches, polishing benches, cleaning the ponds, raking leaves, exterminating pests, repainting of signage, as well as locking and unlocking the gates daily.\nIn the , during the Absolute crisis, Deaths Head of Bhaal Spaulder led a group of Bhaalists to massacre park-goers in the name of the Lord of Murder.\nThe same year, the Bloomridge Park groundskeeper, Lavernica, fell victim to Orin the Red and her bloodthirsty sacrificed to Bhaal."
