'''The Market''' of [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]], was a large, boisterous, and busy open-air plaza marketplace that dealt in a wide variety of goods, while its counterpart – the [[Market Hall (Suzail)|Market Hall]] offered food and produce exclusively.

The Market's dusty expanse{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|65-66}}

===Services===
Most of the plaza was an open space with some permanent stalls and tents dotting the area. All of the merchants loudly advertised their goods to the busy crowds. Some of the typical items found in the Market were [[apple]]s, clothing, [[boot]]s and shoe repair, [[leather]] goods, [[armor]] mending, and fletcher's goods. Small roasting stalls exuded alluring aromas of roasting meats, both common and exotic, and expensive exported fruit and vegetables from faraway lands attracted cooks from noble estates. Bulkier items were also available here, including furniture, and tools.

Days of fair weather were popular among vendors and shoppers who filled the plaza first thing in the morning.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, one of the numerous vendors who flooded the plaza with their goods and air with loud solicitations was [[Razor John]] who offered razor-point [[arrow]]s.

==Notable Locations==
*[[The Crying Witch]], a tavern that faced the Market.
*[[Hardshutters House]], the guild house of the [[Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220517210238/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_101112-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed Oct – Dec 2005| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
