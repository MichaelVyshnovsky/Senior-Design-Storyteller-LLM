The '''Spring of Eternal Hope''' was a temple in [[Shussel]], [[Unther]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] dedicated to the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric goddess]] [[Ishtar]],Though ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' states that this is a temple of Isis, the sourcebook [[Old Empires (sourcebook)|''Old Empires'']] only notes that her aspect Ishtar has an unnamed major temple here. an [[aspect]] of the goddess [[Isis]].

==History==
During the tyrannical reign of the god-king [[Gilgeam]], this and other temples of Ishtar were mandated to turn over half of their funds to him.<ref> The [[priest]]hood of the temple tried their best to remain neutral around the growing rebellion against Gilgeam's reign, even in light of the attacks they suffered by his priests. And only their intervention around this time prevented most of Shussel's inhabitants from starving.<ref>

When Gilgeam's government collapsed following his death during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the clergy of the Spring of Eternal Hope became the ''de facto'' government of Shussel.
