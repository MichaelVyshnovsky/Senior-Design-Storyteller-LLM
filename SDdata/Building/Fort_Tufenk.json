        "mainbody": "Fort Tufenk was a garrison fort located in southern Tethyr. It was also known as the Fortress of Fire.\nFort Tufenk was one of the four major forts located in County Calimmon in Duchy Ankaram, guarding the border with Calimshan, along the River Agis. It sat upon a ridge overlooking an old trail toward Shoonach.\nThe fort was a stone-walled enclosure set atop a small hill and surrounded by deep trenches, about ten to fifteen feet (three to five meters) deep. The walls were also between ten and fifteen feet thick and stood twenty feet (six meters) high.\nAs of 1370 DR, the fort was over 600 years old. The legend was that the ridge upon which the fort was built was constructed by jann during the First Era of Skyfire to serve as a defense against Memnons Army of Fire.\nAccording to some historians, Fort Tufenk was the site where future king and queen Haedrak III and Zaranda I slew Yusuf Jhannivvar after the Storm Siege of Myratma. (Other sources claimed that he was killed upon the ruined western walls of the city.)\nThe Janessar, an organization of warriors and priests who were opposed to slavery in Calimshan, had ties with the leaders of Fort Tufenk.\nThe fort had a single commander who oversaw ten to fifteen junior officers. Between 200 and 300 soldiers were stationed there."
