        "mainbody": "The '''Tower of the Art''' was the headquarters of [[Zhentil Keep]]'s makeshift [[wizard]]s' guild in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Tower was located in south Zhentil Keep in the western section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] along [[Twilight Street]].",
        "Description": "The Tower of the Art stood ten stories tall and easily dominated the new skyline of Zhentil Keep. The Tower did not have a front door. Instead, when a visitor came to the Tower, the wizard on duty activated the [[magic]] of a [[granite]] slab upon which the visitor stood to ''[[teleport]]'' the visitor within the Tower. Visitors exited the Tower in the same manner.",
        "Interior": "Numerous laboratories, bedrooms, studies, libraries, lecture halls, and store rooms could be found within the Tower. The uppermost level was converted into an observatory.",
        "Activities": "An entry fee into the guild was assessed for new wizards based up their current arcane skill. In addition, an annual fee was required that was also based on their skill. Non-guild wizards were allowed to use the facilities of the Tower at a rate of 25 [[gp]] per hour. They were constantly monitored by guild [[mage]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "The guildmaster of the Tower of the Art was a native [[Zhent]] named [[Thagdal]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.",
        "Defenses": "The entire Tower was warded to prevent outside access via ''teleportation'', ''[[gate]]s'', ''[[plane shift]]ing'', or ''[[blink]]ing''. The same wards blocked any outside scrying attempts or movement by [[Astral Plane|astral]] or [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] creatures.",
        "History": "The Tower was previously owned by a powerful [[archmage]], but a group of wizards banded together for survival during the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, and claimed it for themselves."
