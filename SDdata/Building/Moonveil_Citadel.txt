'''Moonveil Citadel''' was a glass fortress in [[Sildëyuir]], and one of the premier mansions in the realm. [[Kiril Duskmourn]] had visited the citadel while she was young.{{cite book/Stardeep|215-216|20}}

When she returned to Sildëyuir in winter of {{yearlink|1375}}, she arrived in time to watch it burn and collapse in front of her. There were a dozen corpses, some of which she recognized, in front of the fire; all of them had their eyes plucked.As she arrives in 1375, and sees the citadel burning, the article assumes that the citadel is destroyed in 1375, considering it unlikely that the citadel has been burning since 1374 or a different year.

[[Tower Aerilpe]] was close to Moonveil Citadel.{{cite book/Stardeep|222|20}}
