'''Grave Hollow''' was a haunted barrow located in the center of the city of [[Archenbridge]], and a popular picnic destination amongst the townsfolk.

==Description==
The hill of Grave Hollow was said to be the tomb of an unknown warrior. According to the locals, anyone trying to dig into the Hollow or lighting a fire in the glen would bring forth moaning [[spirit]]s&mdash;and anyone foolish enough to continue this endeavor would be subject to a terrible curse. Those rumors were encouraged by the owners of the grand mansions along the River Way, trying to discourage [[adventurer]]s and other undesirables from camping in their backyard.

As long as visitors didn't disturb the peculiar rules of the place, the hill was a peaceful and pleasant place. It was used by the local population for picnics, lover's escapades, and shady meetings. Stealthy agents of the [[Swords of Archendale]] patrolled the place, eavesdropping on visitors. They wouldn't usually confront anyone, except if witnessing battle, murder, kidnapping, or other grave crimes.

==Geography==
On the outside, Grave Hollow was a grassy hill encircled by trees. Under the hill was the tomb of an [[elven]] tribe, built by superstitious [[gnome]]s long before Archenbridge was built.

==Defenses==
According to [[Elminster]], at least four [[baelnorn]]s guarded the tomb. They were equipped with many elven [[:Category:Magic items|magic items]], and were responsible for creating the [[wraith]]-like spirits which attacked trespassers. They would also curse interlopers with a powerful [[ironguard]] spell effect which prevented their victims from interacting with any metal object for a whole year. That curse was nigh-impossible to dispel, except by the most knowledgeable spellcasters.

==History==
The tomb was built by gnomes to serve as a resting place for an elven tribe poisoned by rivals. The gnomes entombed the elves with their belongings out of superstition, fearing that keeping anything would bring them misfortune.
