The '''Happy House of Splendor and Song''' was a temple to [[Milil]], Lord of Song, found in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. It was the biggest temple to Milil on the eastern side of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Location==
The Happy House of Splendor and Song lay on the east side of the city.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the deity [[Torm]] resided at [[Temple of Torm's Coming|his temple]] in Tantras. Torm's zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths in the city as "unbelievers". <ref group="note">It is not known if or how the Happy House was affected by this religious persecution.

Nevertheless, the Happy House remained active through to [[1367 DR]] and past [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
The temple of Milil provided support and guidance to local members of the [[Harpers]]. The temple was considered by some to be a place to contact Those Who Harp.

==Inhabitants==
In [[1358 DR]], the temple was led by High Mistress of Song [[Elassuara Narithan]], with six priests and eleven lay-followers. These followers were all low- to mid-range [[bard]]s.
