The Broken Pike was a tavern in the subterranean city of Skullport in Undermountain. It was owned and run by Marks in 1370 DR.
A one-story tavern of shabby quality yet average prices, the Broken Pikes patron were a motley crew of fences, pirates, and smugglers. They were a tight-knit bunch who saw all strangers as targets and prey. One had to stay alert and ready for tricks or violence.
Some regulars used the Broken Pike as a venue to plan their crimes, from theft to murder to worse deeds. It was also a meeting place for the Unseen, so some regular patrons were doppelgangers. The duergar fence Thurn Blackskull could be found here many afternoons.
