The House of Wonder was a mage academy and temple of Mystra located in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.
The temple dedicated to Mystra was located on Flint Street and Pharras Alley, which was named after the first mistress of the temple, Pharra.
In the late 15 century DR, the temple displayed ostentatious towers with mosaics and displays of magic. Throughout the structure, violets were carefully planted in memory of Ahghairon.
During Gods Day on Marpenoth 15, a huge festival was held at the House of Wonder celebrating Midnights elevation as the new Mystra. By the late 14 century DR, this practice had gradually begun to be adopted in other temples of Mystra throughout Faer√ªn.
Prior to the Spellplague and Mystras demise, the House of Wonder was a temple of Mystra. The temple was erected in 1215 DR and continued to function as a house of worship until 1385 DR.  
After the Spellplague, the former temple was used to educate young mages. In 1479 DR, Master Rhinzen Halnian nearly destroyed the entire complex when he cast a meteor swarm spell at three apprentices he mistook for devils during a haepthum-induced stupor. 
By 1480 DR, the House of Wonder had been rebuilt and a new master installed. By 1492 DR, the temple served as a place of worship for all the gods of magic, although Mystra still featured prominently among them.
