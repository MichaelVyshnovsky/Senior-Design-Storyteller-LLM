The '''House of Wonder''' was a mage academy and temple of [[Mystra]] located in the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
The temple dedicated to Mystra was located on [[Flint Street]] and [[Pharra's Alley]], which was named after the first mistress of the temple, [[Pharra]].

==Structure==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple displayed ostentatious towers with mosaics and displays of magic. Throughout the structure, [[violet]]s were carefully planted in memory of [[Ahghairon]].

==Activities==
During [[Gods' Day]] on [[Marpenoth 15]], a huge festival was held at the House of Wonder celebrating [[Midnight]]'s elevation as the new Mystra. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this practice had gradually begun to be adopted in other temples of Mystra throughout [[Faerûn]].

==History==
Prior to the [[Spellplague]] and Mystra's demise, the House of Wonder was a temple of Mystra. The temple was erected in [[1215 DR]] and continued to function as a house of worship until [[1385 DR]].  

After the Spellplague, the former temple was used to educate young [[mage]]s. In [[1479 DR]], Master [[Rhinzen Halnian]] nearly destroyed the entire complex when he cast a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' spell at three apprentices he mistook for [[devil]]s during a [[haepthum]]-induced stupor. 

By [[1480 DR]], the House of Wonder had been rebuilt and a new master installed. By [[1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} the temple served as a place of worship for all the gods of [[magic]], although Mystra still featured prominently among them.
