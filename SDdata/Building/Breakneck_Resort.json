        "mainbody": "The '''Breakneck Resort''' was a ski resort located in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Breakneck Resort was run by [[Henry Coldwater]]. The slopes of the resort were dangerous enough to leave only [[orc]]s and only the most proficient skiers unharmed. At one point, a [[hin]] [[smuggler]] from [[Luskan]] was accepted as an apprentice to Henry Coldwater. [[Jaccob]] became an apprentice tour guide and was said to have had the potential to be the best tour guide in the Ten Towns, despite the region's lackluster tourism. Jaccob's life ended abruptly as the Breakneck Resort proved its name to the newcomer halfling."
