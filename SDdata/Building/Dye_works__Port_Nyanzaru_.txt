The dye works of Port Nyanzaru, Chult was a facility wherein textiles and clothes were dyed in bright colors and patterns, to the delight of locals and exporters alike.
It sat in the northeast of the Market Ward along the cliffs overlooking the sea. The waters at the base of the cliff were stained with bright colors dumped from the great vats of the dye works.
Artisans at the dye works&mdashknown as colorists&mdashtransformed plain fabrics and cloth using bright blue, green, orange, red, and yellow dyes derived from materials from the Chultan jungles and bay. These colorists were easily recognizable by their brightly stained hands and feet.
As little fabric was produced locally (given that the climate of Chult supported neither the growing of cotton nor the raising of sheep), much of the cloth that passed through the dye works was imported. The colored cloth was then either sold to local tailors to create the kilts, pants, and sarongs popular within Port Nyanzaru, or it was exported for resale back in the regions from which it had been purchased.
As of the late 15 century DR, some dye at the dye works was produced using dancing monkey fruit, the sale of which was jealously controlled by the merchant prince Kwayoth√©. When a master colorist named Omala purchased some of the fruit illegally, he soon found his life in danger for the crime.
