'''The House of the Lady''' was a temple of [[Tymora]] in [[Shadowdale]]. This was the oldest temple in the area, built upon the site of an earlier temple of [[Tyche]].

==Inhabitants==
Preceptress [[Eressea Ambergyles]] led Tymora's faithful within the temple. She was assisted by 21 other priests and 28 followers.

==History==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the temple was pillaged and vandalized by devotees of the god [[Bane]]. Its clergy members were slaughtered and their bodies were littered across its inner-most sanctum, while the black hand of Bane's [[holy symbol]] was painted on the wall in their blood.
