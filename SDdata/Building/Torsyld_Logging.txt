Torsyld Logging was a well-kept lumber yard, and timber company, in the town of Velarsburg, owned by the Torsyld family of Harrowdale in the mid-14 century DR. Like all the logging operations of the region, the Torsyld family specialized in a particular type of wood in their case, shadowtop. They were known for using the finest specimens of wood for use as ship masts, among other things.
