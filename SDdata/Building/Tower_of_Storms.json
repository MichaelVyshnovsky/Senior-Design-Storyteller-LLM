        "mainbody": "The '''Tower of Storms''' was a lighthouse on the [[Sword Coast North]] which became a temple dedicated to [[Talos]], god of storms.",
        "Location": "The lighthouse was located atop an {{SIAdj|80|foot}} rocky outcropping which sat about {{SI|130|feet|long=yes}} off the coast of the [[Sea of Swords]]. It was due west of [[Phandalin]] During low tide, travelers could descend the {{SIAdj|100|foot}} coastal cliffs overlooking the tower to a sandy beach and a narrow causeway which connected the tower to the shore. \n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of ships sat wrecked on the rocks beneath the lighthouse.",
        "Structure": "The Tower of Storms consisted of a squat, {{SIAdj|20|foot}} tall stone building with a lighthouse rising another {{SI|20|feet}} from the seaward side. A large lightning rod stood on the building's roof. The lighthouse beacon was open to the elements and surrounded by an iron railing.",
        "Interior": "The ground-floor structure contained a shrine to the god of storms, [[Talos]]. The {{SIAdj|15|foot}} high chapel was adorned with frescoes depicting ships being tossed in a violent storm with Talos watching approvingly. The lighting rod on the roof connected through the ceiling to an altar, and when struck with lightning, the altar could be used to bestow a divine blessing allowing for limited casting of the ''[[lightning bolt]]'' [[spell]].",
        "History": "The Tower of Storms was considered old by residents of Phandalin as of the late 15{{th}} century DR. \n\nAround that time, the tower became a base for the barbaric [[Cult of Talos]].",
        "Inhabitants": "A [[sea elf]] [[banshee]] named [[Miraal]] haunted the causeway connecting the tower to the shore, and a tribe of [[harpies]] nested on the southern side of the outcropping on which the tower was built. An [[awaken]]ed [[giant crab]] was known to make its home on the nearby beach and [[hunter shark]]s prowled the nearby wrecks, including the dangerous [[Daggermaw]]."
