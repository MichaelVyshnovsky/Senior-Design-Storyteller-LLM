        "mainbody": "The '''Weary Knight Inn''' was an inn and a tavern, average by all accords, located in the city of [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]].",
        "Location": "[[File:Weary Knight Inn map.png|thumb|''The location of the Weary Knight Inn in the city of [[Arabel]].''|320x320px]]\nThe roadhouse stood across the street and to the east from the [[Citadel (Arabel)|Citadel]]. The city's Eastgate was three blocks away. Immediately to the east from the Weary Knight Inn stood grand villa of the noble [[House Marliir]] and further west&mdash;the [[Lady's House]], Arabel's temple of [[Tymora]].",
        "Structure": "The Weary Knight was a roadhouse with sizable stables attached to the main building.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The most notable thing about the Knight was its pleasant and exuberant atmosphere. The innkeeper in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR was [[Alanaerle]]. She was a big woman with a face that scared children. Despite her looks, she was a pleasant company and a jolly host who loved sad love stories and ballads with happy endings. She never failed to fill the inn's common room with traveling [[minstrel]]s, singers, [[bard]]s, and storytellers. She cut prices in half in exchange for performances. This guaranteed the Knight filled with sorrowful ballads and lively tales on the daily."
        },
        "Services": "The inn offered the usual service of food, drink, lodgings, and music to its guests. Alanaerle prepared a cozy parlor on the other side of the common room for those who considered sad ballads unappealing. Those who chose to eat there were spared from romantic moaning of overly-eloquent bards.\n\nRegularly priced room and a meal costed guests two [[gold]] [[coin]]s, while entertainers were charged only a single gold.",
        "History": "[[File:Alanaerle.png|thumb|''Innkeeper [[Alanaerle]], listening to a romantic ballad performed by a traveling [[minstrel]].''|320x320px]]\nThe famous adventuring troupe, [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], in their earliest incarnation&mdash; at the time going by the \"Swords of Eveningstar\", visited the Weary Knight Inn in the {{YearlinkName|1348}}. The over-eager young adventurers mistakingly thought the inn to be one of the finest in Arabel.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Alanaerle provided food and lodgings for a small group of adventurers tasked by the city's Lady Lord Myrmeen Lhal with the investigation into a series of [[wizard]] murders.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|34}}\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Alanaerle and her establishment remained open and popular. Volothamp Geddarm listed the inn in his ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr|Guide to Cormyr]]'' and complemented the establishments for its welcoming atmosphere and its eccentric innkeeper.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "*Many locals believed that the body in side the tomb was wearing an ancient set of [[gold]]en [[armor]]."
