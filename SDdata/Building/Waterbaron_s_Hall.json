It served as their personal residence and the site where they held open court.\nIt was located in the center of Yartar, near the central marketplace and several prominent establishments. The Fishyard was situated just in front of its entrance.\nA number of lion statues, carved from stone, decorated the exterior of the Waterbarons Hall. These were in fact elaborately decorated stocks used to hold prisoners in between their punishments.\nUnlike the rest of the city, which was traditionally kept dark at night, the outside of the Waterbarons Hall was illuminated with a number of torches.\nThe palace itself featured a number of columns that held up its overhanging, gable style roof. The chambers within were quite spacious, carrying the voices of anyone inside.\nIts interior was decorated with marble sculptures and fine tapestries.\nBeyond the Waterbaron, a number of Yartarran merchants were granted residence within the palace.\nIt also served as a feasting hall, on occasions when the Waterbaron hosted influential guests. As of the late 15 century DR, individuals who worked alongside the Lords Alliance were readily welcome within the Waterbarons Hall.\nThe Waterbarons Hall was protected by a ward that prevented anyone within from having their blood shed. As such, most of those within wielded maces or some form of magic."
