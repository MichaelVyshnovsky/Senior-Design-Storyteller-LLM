Khassinsara was a fortress located beneath the waters of the Thingulph on the Chultan Peninsula.
The fortress was located in the western Thingulph  offshore from the capital of Thindar.
Khassinsara was made entirely from coral and blended in so well with its surroundings that it was practically unrecognizable as a fortress.
Yuan-ti from House Sseradess claimed the fortress as their own.
