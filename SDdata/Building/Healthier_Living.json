        "mainbody": "'''Healthier Living''' was an [[apothecary]] shop and clinic in the [[Flask Circle]] market of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime around [[1370 DR]], it went out of business and the building housing it became the new home of [[Winn's Ice House]].",
        "Structure": "The exterior of this building had a rather unkempt appearance. Inside, the walls were grooved and scorched as if an explosion had occurred, which was caused by former owner of the building. The back of the room had a desk and was lined with several cabinets, while off to the left side was a small cot.",
        "Services": "In addition to selling medicinal [[herb]]s and [[potion]]s, this business offered castings of restorative [[divine magic]] from [[scroll]]s. Being a charitable business, Healthier Living charged customers whatever they could manage to afford in return for these services.",
        "History": "Prior to housing Healthier Living, this building was occupied by an [[alchemist]] by the name of [[Wendell]]. After having one too many accidents occur within, he was evicted from the building.\n\nAround the late 14{{th}} century DR, when Healthier Living was still in business, a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the shop in search of supplies for the since relocated Wendell. When they entered they found the proprietor, [[Maltornis|Sister Maltornis]], was caring for a mother and her ill baby. The wailing child had red skin and small welts across its arms and legs, the latest victim of a mysterious [[disease]] that was spreading through the destitute parts of Ravens Bluff. Maltornis informed the mother that none of her herbal mixtures or potions could cure the child, but reassured her all was okay, as she took a [[scroll case]] out from one of the rear cabinets and cast some spell upon the child that cured it of its disease. Choked by tears, the mother thanked Maltornis before leaving.\n\nSister Maltornis was unable to provide the adventurers most of what they had listed on their shopping list, providing only some diced [[palm|palm seeds]] in return for three [[gemstone]]s they were given by Wendell to barter with, each worth 60 [[gold piece]]s. Maltornis then asked the adventurers if they would be willing to acquire some [[orchid]]s for her, which were growing in a small grove near the [[Fire River]], so she could brew more ''[[antidote]]s''.",
        "Inhabitants": "This shop was ran by a [[half-orc]] [[herbalist]] and [[cleric]] known as Sister Maltornis."
