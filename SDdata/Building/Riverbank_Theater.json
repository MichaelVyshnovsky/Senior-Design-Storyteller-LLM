Globes of colored glass enchanted with continual light illuminated the plush interior.\nThe theater put on nightly performance by bards, jugglers, dancers, jesters, etc. A popular play featured here was Cyric the Duck Sun.\nBefore the destruction of the city in the , the structure was used to house humanoid armies employed by Zhentil Keep. After the citys destruction it lay abandoned for a brief period of time before being taken over by a group of bards and performers who could not escape the city.
