        "Description": "The acoustics within the theater were perfect for projecting sound. The Riverbank Theater could seat 2,500 patrons at a time. Globes of colored glass enchanted with ''[[continual light]]'' illuminated the plush interior.",
        "Activities": "The theater put on nightly performance by bards, jugglers, dancers, jesters, etc. A popular play featured here was ''[[Cyric the Duck Sun]]''.",
        "History": "Before the destruction of the city in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the structure was used to house [[humanoid]] armies employed by Zhentil Keep. After the city's destruction it lay abandoned for a brief period of time before being taken over by a group of [[bard]]s and performers who could not escape the city. Upon hearing of the bards' occupation of the building, Lord [[Orgauth]] hired artists to restore the building so it could put on proper shows."
