The '''Black Tomb of the Corsair''' was the final resting place of King [[Haedrak II]] of [[Tethyr]], known as the Corsair Prince,

==Location==
The Black Tomb of the Corsair was located along the [[Firedrake Road]] that hugged the [[Firedrake Shores]], starting at the town of [[Mosstone]] and moving west. The cove where the tomb was built was once used by the Corsair Prince for mooring.

==Structure==
The tomb was constructed of black [[basalt]]. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the landmark showed signs of decay. The tomb's ruins resembled a broken black hand raising up from the cliff overlooking the scenic [[Firedrake Bay]].

==History==
This tomb was built on the order of King [[Errilam I]] of [[Tethyr]] before his own demise in {{YearlinkName|1277}}, for his father, Haedrak II. The structure was meant to celebrate Haedrak's revolutionary piratical struggle against his uncle [[Kymer]] the Shade King. The Corsair Prince claimed the cliff that later would be his tomb was the best vantage point overlooking both peninsulas of Tethyr and its access to the [[Trackless Sea]].

As the nation of Tethyr burned in the events of [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], the Black Tomb of the Corsair was spared pillaging as the Corsair Prince was beloved by the common folk. However, the tomb did not escape desecration. In the years that followed the Black Days, a gang of [[ogre]]s cracked the black basalt spires and toppled the statue of Haedrak II. The tomb was opened, and the ogres plundered it for valuables. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Black Tomb of the Corsair remained a broken-open cairn and a landmark for travelers. Its riches were gone, along with the Corsair Prince's body.

==Rumors & Legends==
After the tomb's desecration, locals started talking about a [[ghost]]ly apparition of the Corsair Prince haunting the roads close to the ruins. The ghost caught those responsible for the destruction of his final resting place and confronted lone travelers seeking revenge. One [[minstrel]] song about Haedrak the Second claimed that if his ghost were ever to find aid against the ogres responsible, who dwelt in the forests of the peninsula, the Corsair Prince would reveal the location of his long-lost treasure as a reward.
