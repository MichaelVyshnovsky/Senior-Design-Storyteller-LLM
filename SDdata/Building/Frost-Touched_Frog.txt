The '''Frost-Touched Frog''' was an inn that operated in [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by [[Alatha Riversword]].

==Location==
It lay in the northwestern outskirts of the town, beyond the [[Cart and Coin]] caravan supplier.

==Interior==
The walls of the inn were decorated with a variety of hunting trophies. The furniture was old and oft-repaired.

===Atmosphere===
The Frog was a lively, loud, and nearly rowdy establishment that attracted an eclectic mix of clientele. These guests loved to share increasingly boastful and exhilarating tales about their journeys.

==History==
The inn was in business by the mid-1360s DR and through [[1370 DR]].

A century later, in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Frost-Touched Frog was abandoned, boarded-up, and had fallen into disrepair. Weeds grew high around it and vandals had scratched crude remarks into the boards.
