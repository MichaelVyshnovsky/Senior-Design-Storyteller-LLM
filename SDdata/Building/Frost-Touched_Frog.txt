The Frost-Touched Frog was an inn that operated in Triboar in the Dessarin Valley during the late 14 century DR. It was owned by Alatha Riversword.
It lay in the northwestern outskirts of the town, beyond the Cart and Coin caravan supplier.
The walls of the inn were decorated with a variety of hunting trophies. The furniture was old and oft-repaired.
The Frog was a lively, loud, and nearly rowdy establishment that attracted an eclectic mix of clientele. These guests loved to share increasingly boastful and exhilarating tales about their journeys.
The inn was in business by the mid-1360s DR and through 1370 DR.
A century later, in the late 15 century DR, the Frost-Touched Frog was abandoned, boarded-up, and had fallen into disrepair. Weeds grew high around it and vandals had scratched crude remarks into the boards.
