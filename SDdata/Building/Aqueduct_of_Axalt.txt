The '''Aqueduct of Axalt''' was a wonder of engineering and a famous landmark that rose above the [[Valley of Nexal]] in [[Maztica]].

==Location==
The Aqueduct began at the freshwater pool formed by the lush [[Cicada Spring]] that ran off [[Mount Popol]]'s southwestern slope. The waster was carried by the Aqueduct of Axalt for over eight miles, to the north, over the great [[Lake of Tezca]] and ended in a reservoir at the [[Sacred Plaza]] of [[Nexal]].

==Structure==
The Aqueduct of Axalt was a wide structure with two troughs, allowing the water supply never to stop even when the aqueduct was cleaned or repaired.

==History==
The aqueduct that supplied Nexal with freshwater was built during the twenty-two-year reign of the [[Revered Counsellor]] [[Axalt]], the successor of [[Chalco]]. It was considered to be the most impressive accomplishment of the Revered Counsellor of Nexal and greatly benefited the city, bringing fresh, clean, and good-tasting spring water made available to all. Despite the fact that the four great lakes that surrounded Nexal city had drinkable water, the Aqueduct of Axalt provided water of better quality.

The aqueduct's construction was finished when [[Poshtli]], the [[Eagle Knights (Maztica)|Eagle Knight]] hero of Maztica, was a young boy, decades before the {{YearlinkName|1361}}.
