The '''Golden Hills Hearth''' was a [[festhall]] in the underground city-state of [[Blingdenstone]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Structure==
Rather than a building proper, the Golden Hills Hearth was housed in a sprawling burrow, with an entry door that was sized for those of [[gnome|gnomish]] height.

==Services==
This festhall catered largely to the young, unattached men of [[svirfneblin]] society. In addition to [[Prostitution|favors for coin]], the festhall also functioned as a tavern, theater, and casino. Their services were rated by travelers as being excellent and moderately priced, offering up quite the cozy environment.

Any large surface dwellers that came into the establishment would usually find themselves shooed off by the proprietor and redirected to Blingdenstone's local alehouse, the [[Foaming Mug]].

==Inhabitants==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the mistress of the festhall was one [[Splitshale]]. The [[coin-lass]]es who worked at this festhall went by the collective title "Ladies of the Golden Hills", which was in reference to the fabled lost goddesses of the [[Gnome pantheon]].
