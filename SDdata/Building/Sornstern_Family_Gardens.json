        "mainbody": "he Sornstern Family Gardens were a part of the Sornstern residence in Suzail in Cormyr in the late 15 century DR.\nThe gardens were ringed with tall and spike-topped walls. There was at least one shadowtop tree, and it had a bower underneath.\nThe Sornstern family gardens were the favored location for secret conversations between Delasko Sornstern and Broryn Windstag, who were often overheard by Talonar Winter, a War Wizard. One particular talk of theirs covered blueflame ghosts, which they had reason to believe were controlled by the young Lord Marlin Stormserpent, and Lord Haedro Sornsterns contact with Elminster Aumar, a renegade wizard."
