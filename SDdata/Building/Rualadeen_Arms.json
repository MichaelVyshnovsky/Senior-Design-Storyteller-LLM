        "mainbody": "'''Rualadeen Arms''' was a renowned smithy and [[weapon]] shop in [[Eileanar]].",
        "Location": "The smithy was located on the underside of the enclave among other structures that clung to the reversed peak. It did not hang from the surface, but benefited from the enclave's locally reversed [[gravity plane]] that allowed it to be built \"normally\" while upside-down.",
        "Services": "[[Rualadeen]] was considered to be the best weaponsmith in Eileanar, with a special talent for [[polearm]]s and huge [[two-handed sword]]s. The weapons he made had a unique ability to resist rust, corrosion, and magical effects that would harm them. He employed [[Sleda]] and [[Cheron]] to assist in the creation of these fine products, and personally finished the projects to ensure their high quality."
