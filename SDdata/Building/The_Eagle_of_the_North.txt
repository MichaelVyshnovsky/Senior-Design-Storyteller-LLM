The Eagle of the North was an inn found in Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The inn was located in east Zhentil Keep near the Dragon Gate within the Common Quarter. The inn lay at the intersection of Fortress Street and the Street of Dragons.
The entire building was drab and appeared to be quite old. Scented brass lamps were to illuminate the interior of the inn which gave it a peculiar smell.
Though lacking in luxurious amenities, The Eagle of the North was still more than comfortable while remaining moderately priced. Zhentilar gate guards often crashed here if they were too drunk to make it home.
