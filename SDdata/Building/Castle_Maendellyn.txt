Castle Maendellyn was the home of the elves of House Maendellyn in Myth Drannor.
The castle bristled with slender towers and counted numerous windows, otherwise resembling a mound of greenery. Its flanks were covered in ivy and the garden had a number of pools and statues. Several small, moss-colored islands, connected by bridges, were part of the garden too.
From the inside, the outer wall of the compound was cloaked in high trees, tangled thickly.
The outer wall bore a number of magical enchantments. A great number of large windows on the upper side of the house were actually magical fields that allowed breezes through while preventing solid objects from crossing. The actual number of layers in the barriers was at least three.
At least one anti-poison field was operative in the house.
In the , Elminster Aumar, then a ghost of sorts, witnessed a conspiracy against Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl being discussed in Castle Maendellyn. At least five lords and a Starym envoy, Llombaerth Starym, were involved the five lords were Maendellyn, Yeschant, Tassarion, Bellas, and a fifth Ortaure lord, who named Leayonadas as his dead heir.
