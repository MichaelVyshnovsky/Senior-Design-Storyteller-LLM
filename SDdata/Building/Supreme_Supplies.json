        "mainbody": "'''Supreme Supplies''' was an [[alchemy]] supplies shop in the [[Flask Circle]] market of [[Ravens Bluff]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ran by the [[gnome]] [[Syrondario]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}",
        "Location": "As one entered the Flask Circle, this shop would be the first building to their right.Since the only entrance to the Flask Circle in ''Scavenger Hunt'' was [[Flora's Flower Shop]], that would therefore put this building directly to the right of it.",
        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "Inside Supreme Supplies was filled to the brim with various shelves, piled high with all manner of merchandise."
        },
        "Services": "Supreme Supplies specialized in alchemical goods. These included such things as [[balance scale]]s, [[centrifuge]]s, [[flask]]s, [[furnace]]s in many sizes, [[glass]] [[beaker]]s, [[glass tubing]], metal [[utensil]]s and holders that were strangely shaped, small metal pans, variously shaped and sized [[porcelain]] [[jar]]s and [[urn]]s, [[globe]]s that could open up and be used as storage containers, tables and countertops that were specialized for alchemy, and large number of other goods that would be unrecognizable to non-alchemists.\n\nThe shop also carried some alchemical ingredients{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|12}}",
        "History": "Around the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the [[alchemist]] [[Wendell]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3-4}} When they eventually approached Supreme Supplies they found a small sign on the front door that read \"Closed due to Pest Infestation\". Syrondario was sitting on the bench outside and quickly approached them as they got close his shop, asking them politely to avoid his shop and explaining that earlier in the day some \"clumsy oaf\" had brought in a large jar full of [[bookworm]]s. The jar broke whilst they were inside and infested his shop.The adventure claims on page 11 that Syrondario is unaware that the bugs within his shop are bookworms and thus does not inform players of the danger inside. Yet on the following page it's shown that he recognizes what they are, cause he knows what their value would be to the neighboring [[wizard]].\n\nSyrondario was visibly upset, though more so over the possibility of blame being directed at him if the bugs were to escape. He then offered each of the adventurers a hundred [[gold piece]]s if they could deal with his infestation and told them to knock on the door for him once they were certain that all bookworms were eradicated.\n\nOnce the adventurers succeeded in their extermination duties, Syrondario went inside and brought a glass container before them. He insisted that just to be on the safe side they could place all of the slain bookworms within it, though his real motivation was to later sell them to his neighbor [[Tarwell]] of [[Material Assistance]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|6}} for 10 gp a piece. With that out of the way, the party then proceeded to buy the majority of the alchemical ingredients that Wendell had sent them to Flask Circle to acquire."
