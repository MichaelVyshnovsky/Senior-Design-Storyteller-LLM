        "mainbody": "Supreme Supplies was an alchemy supplies shop in the Flask Circle market of Ravens Bluff, in the late 14 century DR, ran by the gnome Syrondario.\nAs one entered the Flask Circle, this shop would be the first building to their right.Since the only entrance to the Flask Circle in Scavenger Hunt was Floras Flower Shop, that would therefore put this building directly to the right of it.\nThis building had a large sign hung on its window that bore the name of the shop and a bench was situated right outside the front entrance.\nInside Supreme Supplies was filled to the brim with various shelves, piled high with all manner of merchandise.\nSupreme Supplies specialized in alchemical goods. These included such things as balance scales, centrifuges, flasks, furnaces in many sizes, glass beakers, glass tubing, metal utensils and holders that were strangely shaped, small metal pans, variously shaped and sized porcelain jars and urns, globes that could open up and be used as storage containers, tables and countertops that were specialized for alchemy, and large number of other goods that would be unrecognizable to non-alchemists.\nThe shop also carried some alchemical ingredients\nAround the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the alchemist Wendell. When they eventually approached Supreme Supplies they found a small sign on the front door that read \"Closed due to Pest Infestation\". Syrondario was sitting on the bench outside and quickly approached them as they got close his shop, asking them politely to avoid his shop and explaining that earlier in the day some \"clumsy oaf\" had brought in a large jar full of bookworms. The jar broke whilst they were inside and infested his shop.The adventure claims on page 11 that Syrondario is unaware that the bugs within his shop are bookworms and thus does not inform players of the danger inside. Yet on the following page its shown that he recognizes what they are, cause he knows what their value would be to the neighboring wizard.\nSyrondario was visibly upset, though more so over the possibility of blame being directed at him if the bugs were to escape. He then offered each of the adventurers a hundred gold pieces if they could deal with his infestation and told them to knock on the door for him once they were certain that all bookworms were eradicated.\nOnce the adventurers succeeded in their extermination duties, Syrondario went inside and brought a glass container before them. He insisted that just to be on the safe side they could place all of the slain bookworms within it, though his real motivation was to later sell them to his neighbor Tarwell of Material Assistance for 10 gp a piece. With that out of the way, the party then proceeded to buy the majority of the alchemical ingredients that Wendell had sent them to Flask Circle to acquire."
