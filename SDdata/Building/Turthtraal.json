        "mainbody": "urthtraal was the duty-house and garthraun (police) station that guarded Handrornlar, the north gate that pierced the double walls surrounding Kh√¥ltar, the Iron City, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nTurthtraal was the collective name of the two towers on either side of Handrornlar just inside the city walls. They were at the intersection of two of the three great thoroughfares that connected the three city gates in a huge triangle Orntathtar Way and the North Way. Facing north out of the gate, the left-hand tower was called Drurntraal (literally, \"West Traal\") (A traal was any business or building that catered to outsiders.) Next to Drurntraal, on Orntathtar Way, was Taurgaurs Tarjteir and then Phlambrors tavern.\nThe twin towers of Turthtraal were squat stone towers that resembled oversized turrets. They were each connected to the inner wall by an arc of battlements that funneled traffic to the gate.\nTurthtraal contained garthraun offices, small vaults for holding goods and a few cells for holding prisoners, and armories.\nIts main day-to-day function was as a duty-house where wagons and caravan beasts had their cargo inspected and the entry tax was collected."
