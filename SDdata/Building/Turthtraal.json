        "Location": "Turthtraal was the collective name of the two towers on either side of Handrornlar just inside the city walls. They were at the intersection of two of the three great thoroughfares that connected the three city gates in a huge triangle: [[Orntathtar Way]] and the [[North Way]]. Facing north out of the gate, the left-hand tower was called Drurntraal (literally, \"West Traal\"){{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76-77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}} (A traal was any business or building that catered to outsiders.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|65}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 52 Khôltar, Part 3, Third Impressions}}) Next to Drurntraal, on Orntathtar Way, was [[Taurgaur's Tarjteir]] and then [[Phlambror's]] tavern.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77-78}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 60: Khôltar, Part 11, A Last Look Around Handrornlar}}",
        "Structure": "The twin towers of Turthtraal were squat stone towers that resembled oversized turrets. They were each connected to the inner wall by an arc of battlements that funneled traffic to the gate.",
        "Interior": "Turthtraal contained garthraun offices, small vaults for holding goods and a few cells for holding prisoners, and armories.",
        "Activities": "Its main day-to-day function was as a duty-house where wagons and caravan beasts had their cargo inspected and the entry tax was collected."
