The '''Shrine of Axes''' was a multi-faith shrine found in the small town of [[Parnast]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
It comprised a simple woodman's shack, with statues of several deities found within.

==Interior==
The shrine featured a statue of the [[elven pantheon|elven deity]] [[Angharradh]], meant to represent the season of spring to the local townsfolk. The goddess' likeness was surrounded by statues of four [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian deities]] that represented three seasons of the year: [[Auril]] for winter, [[Chauntea]] for summer, and [[Mielikki]] for autumn.

==History==
At some point in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the statue of Angharradh had been vandalized and the hands of the goddess had been removed. The statue of Mielikki on the other hand had been well preserved and even refurbished.
