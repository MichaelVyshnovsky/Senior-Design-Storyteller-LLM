Oparils Tower was a dusty inn found in Zhentil Keep in 1358 DR.
Oparils Tower sat in the south section of Zhentil Keep in the Harbor District on Barge Street.
The "tower" of Oparils Tower rose several stories above the surrounding buildings in the Harbor District. The interior of the inn was decorated with tapestries collected throughout Faer√ªn. The inn rented twenty rooms and had a bathhouse for use.
Though lacking in luxurious amenities, Oparils Tower was still more than comfortable while remaining moderately priced. The owner of Oparils Tower ensured that the best singers and performers to be found within Zhentil Keep were hired to perform within the inn.
The inn was owned by aging bard named Oparil.
