The Horngate was the great arched northwestern gate into Suzail, the capital of Cormyr.
The Horngate stood on the northwestern part of Suzail, where the Way of the Dragon ended and the citys grand Promenade began.
The arched gateway was topped with apartments, including the home of Huldyl Rauthur, a War Wizardin service of Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, the Royal Magician, in the late 14 century DR.
The Horngate was guarded by a garrison of crossbow-armed Purple Dragons. Each person or group who entered Suzail through the great gate was stopped and asked to report their visits purpose and to present appropriate paperwork, like Cormyrs adventuring charters.
Just like the Eastgate, and the Field-Gates, the Horngate was a citadel-like fortification that offered solid defenses to Suzails northwest entrance. Its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals barred from entering the capital of Cormyr.
