        "History": "The Great Door was constructed by two great [[wizard]]s, [[Ostus Agrivar]] and [[Parwyyd Hanifar]], who worked together to explore the frontiers of [[magic]]. They built the Door as a means to easily enter the [[planes]]. Each wizard needed the other to control the Door, however, so it remained closed after Ostus's death{{Cite comic/The Gathering}}\n\nBy the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the Great Door had been tampered with by an unknown power. It stood ajar and monsters from other planes emerged from it. Some people grew understandably rather angry about this, and believed that killing Parwyyd would cause the Door to close again. With a small military force, they laid siege to Parwyyd's tower, and he considered them \"misinformed\".\n\nTo deal with the Door, Parwyyd lured [[Kyriani Agrivar]] to the site. She was the \"blood of Agrivar\"—Ostus's daughter—and bore his [[magic aura]], so she could take Ostus's place in controlling the Door. However, one of the faces on the Door spoke, taunting Parwyyd that he no longer had control, and flying [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s emerged. In the fight, [[Onyx the Invincible]] briefly fell through the Door, and saw what looked to be the [[Hells]]. [[Dunstanny]]—Parwyyd's personal assistant—explained that Parwyyd and Kyriani needed to work together close the Door, but as they debated it shot a bolt of magic that separated the merged being Kyriani into [[Cybriana]] and [[Kilili]].\n\nThe power that had tampered with the Great Door then seized greater control, raising it into the air and untethering the interdimensional wormhole from the Door, having it appear in the skies over Waterdeep instead. Kenkus and [[gargoyle]]s swarmed over the city, and were engaged by [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] and [[Timoth Eyesbright]], before the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] took over.\n\nIn the Hells, a gargantuan and monstrous creature, the [[one who waits]], had seen the other side of the Door appear in its realm. It believed it to be a gift from the god [[Bane]], Lord of Tyranny, and slithered toward it. Its attendants, the gargoyles and kenkus, had gone on ahead.\n\nThe interdimensional wormhole returned to the Great Door, and the kenkus and gargoyles emerged in the pit, followed by a [[fire elemental]], while the branches of a nearby tree turned to serpents. Cybriana, Onyx, Parwyyd and Dunstanny battled the kenkus and gargoyles until Kyriani was ultimately restored. Working together, Parwyyd and Kyriani first let the door open wide to let the one who waits through, then used ''[[telekinesis]]'' to slam it shut on its trunk, slaying the monstrosity. Parwyyd then destroyed his Great Door with a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell, and the threat it posed was ended.\n\nKhelben later theorized to Kyriani that evil gods—Bane and his allies, most likely—had taken control of the Great Door, as part of some scheme leading into the events of the [[Time of Troubles]] that year.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|10}}"
