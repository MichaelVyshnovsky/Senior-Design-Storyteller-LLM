        "mainbody": "'''Ankle Bells''' was a busy and expensive tavern in [[Tharkar]] of the [[Free Cities of Parsanic]], and the second-most-crowded space after [[Donder's Dancing Masques]].",
        "Structure": "The tavern had a damp and spacious cellar that held a hidden smugglers' tunnel that led to the harbor of Tharkar. The upper floors of the building were used as guest rooms for their many clients.",
        "Atmosphere": "The guest rooms in Ankle Bells were famously scented and [[perfum]]ed to hide other unpalatable human odors. \n\nThe Bells, like many other public places in the city, had a strong dislike for the dangerous [[Daggers of Tharkar]] and had a contingency plan in case one of the clients needed to escape. The tavern had a false trapped door to distract the possible Daggers' intrusion, as well as another one that collapsed if forced open, among quite a few others.",
        "Services": "Apart from providing food and drinks and renting out the damp cellar and smelly rooms, Ankle Bells also offered skilled actors for hire. These performers came equipped with enchanted masks that could mirror a client's appearance, and were often used to create an alibi.",
        "History": "A pirate of the ''[[Kissing Shark]]'' vessel, [[Sharessa Stagwood|Sharessa \"The Shadow\" Stagwood]] worked at Ankle Bells for a season at some point before 1377 DR.\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], a mysterious agent named [[Belmer Droon]] rented the Bells' cellar to use it as his temporary base of operations. Here he hid a group of pirates of the ''Kissing Shark'', after rescuing them from the Daggers of Tharkar after a bar brawl. Belmer also paid a group of ten actors of the Ankle Bells to act out a bar fight to dissuade the Daggers from trying to investigate the tavern for the missing criminals."
