        "mainbody": "he Dark Pit of Maleficence was a subterranean fortress and temple dedicated to Gargauth, the Hidden Lord.\nThe fortress was constructed within the Landrise at the supposed location of Gargauths first appearance on Toril within the ruins of Peleveran fifty years after the citys destruction.\nThe Dark Pit sat along the floor of a large cavern that served as a granary for Peleveran. The building was intertwined with vast stalactites and stalagmites. The structure derived its name from the massive pit found along the floor of the cavern that was rumored to connect to Baator.\nThe temple and grounds were maintained by a hundred clergy and over 250 followers.\nMany natives of the region fell to Gargauths dark influence, serving as scouts for anything occurring near the Dark Pit of Maleficence."
