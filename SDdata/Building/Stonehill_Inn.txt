The '''Stonehill Inn''' was a quaint [[inn]] in the village of [[Phandalin]].

==Location==
The modest inn was located close to the center of town.

==Structure==
Newly built in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the inn was a large, two-story building was made of unrefined rocks and crudely cut wood.

===Atmosphere===
The villagers of Phandalin, from miners to farmers, enjoyed relaxing in the common room, which became a good place to hear local gossip and stories.

==Services==
The Stonehill Inn was owned by [[Toblen Stonehill]], who operated it alongside his wife [[Trilena Stonehill]] and with help from his son [[Pip Stonehill]].

The inn provided six rentable rooms on the upper floor, plus alcoholic beverages and food. A bed was five [[currency|silver pieces]] a night, and prices were fairly standard for food, [[ale]], and [[cider]], with meals coming to about 1 [[currency|silver piece]]. A barmaid called [[Elsa]] served drinks at the bar.

==History==
The Stonehills arrived in Phandalin from Triboar early in the construction of the town, and founded the inn around [[1490 DR]].{{AI-time}} During the [[Redbrands]]' reign of terror throughout Phandalin in [[1491 DR]], the bandits did not frequent the inn, preferring to drink at the [[Sleeping Giant]] a few buildings to the east.{{Phandelver-time}}

Business continued more-or-less as usual during the rampage of the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] across the countryside. The inn played host to important visitors during this time, such as [[Don-Jon Raskin]], the man who was in charge of reopening the [[Mountain's Toe]] [[gold]] mines. The inn's common room also became a favorite haunt for [[Argus Skeel]], a [[vampire spawn]] in service to the [[necromancer]] [[Ularan Mortus]].

By [[1496 DR]], the inn remained prosperous and largely unchanged. However, at some point the Stonehills had borrowed money from the town banker and former townmaster, [[Harbin Wester]], and he was attempting to leverage the small amount they still owed to take away their business.
