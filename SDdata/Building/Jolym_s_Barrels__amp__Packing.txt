Jolyms Barrels & Packing was a coopers shop in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale. Owned by Jolym, it was in operation by 1366 DR.Unlike the other Loudwater locations described in Volos Guide to the North, Jolyms Barrels & Packing is not reprinted in The North Guide to the Savage Frontier. It was more likely omitted for reasons of space, rather than being out of business.
The store sold barrels for 3 gold pieces, hand kegs for 1 gp, and standard-sized crates for 2 silver pieces each. Jolym also manufactured packing crates of custom size or purpose prices ranged from 5 sp (usually for a crate large enough for two people to carry) to 5 gp each.
