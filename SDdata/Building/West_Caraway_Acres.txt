The '''West Caraway Acres''' was a large mansion in the [[Neverwintian]] countryside that belonged to a wealthy [[dragonborn]] [[wizard]] named [[Torlinn Shrake]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
The mansion was surrounded by a hedge garden with its topiaries shaped to resemble creatures like [[giant]]s, [[wyvern]]s, and [[unicorn]]s. One of the topiaries was cut to depict a battle between Torlinn and the [[beholder]] named [[Sharrestren]], the deed that made the dragonborn spellcaster famous. A circular drive passed the decorated hedges and led towards the West Caraway Acres's grand entrance, with the servants' entrance tucked away in the back of the building. At night' the driveway was lit with sparking [[torch]]s of orange, green, blue, and white flames.

The grand entrance, cut of tall [[obsidian]] blocks and decorated with [[gold]]en impressions around the edge, was built at the zenith of a short stone stair climb. Past the black gates stood a small foyer guarded by sentries clad in [[plate armor]] and a doorwoman. The foyer was illuminated by floating [[enchanted]] ''[[driftglobe]]'' and at the end – stood a set of double doors that opened into the West Caraway Acres's main banquet hall.

==Interior==
The West Caraway Acres's main banquet hall was a massive two-story ballroom of black [[marble]] encircled by a second-story balcony. The rood had an unsettling, unevenly hexagonal shape. The room's tall stained glass windows were adorned in a drapery of gold with a damask design. The stained glass depicted scenes of [[dragon]]s attacking cities of exotic [[Rashemen]] and [[Amn]].

During Torlinn's last ball, the wizard hired an orchestra of twenty [[lute]], [[flute]], singers, a conductor, and a [[dwarf]] [[pipe organ]] player. All were magically suspended on the ballroom's ceiling, playing upside down.

One of the ballroom's doors led to the mansion's grand library with ceiling-tall bookshelves covering the entire room, separated by an occasional [[dragonborn]] portrait. Just like the main room, the library was two-story tall with a balcony incurring the second floor, with yet more books plastering all the walls.

A theater could be found behind another ballroom door. The large dim room held divans and couches upholstered in [[silk]] in place of theater row seatings. The stage was a collection of platforms shaped to resemble magical beasts and clouds to accommodate a troupe of gymnasts that swung around and flew under the effects of ''[[potions of flying]]''.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the West Caraway Acres hosted regular overly lavish parties and revelries hosted by its dragonborn owner. There were rumors that servants and guests routinely disappeared during such events. One such party – a grand masquerade, was when [[Edgin Darvis]], his daughter [[Kira]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], and [[Simon Aumar]] attempted to pull out a heist. They aimed to steal a great [[artifact]] – the ''[[Staff of Aorth]]'', with the help of one of the wizard's disgruntled servants, [[half-elven]] lass named [[Alyanna]]. After getting inside as guests and servants, they thieves made way into the vault only to become sealed in and forced to move through a secret passage to the mansion's sprawling dungeon.

The first room of the dungeon was where the group was sealed in, once again, leaving them in a large room that imitated the West Caraway Acres's ballroom. The dance floor was trapped, dropping boulders on anyone who failed to dance across to the melody of Torlinn Shrake's favorite song – the ''[[Light-Footed Maiden]]''. Luckily, everyone avoided the magical trap unharmed, allowing them passage onto the next part of the grim entertainment prepared by the dragonborn host.

The next room was a copy of the manse's library. Unable to remember the name of the poem favored by Torlinn, the group activated the trap. It collapsed one of the bookshelves and unleashed a [[basilisk]], who already [[petrified]] another unlucky guest earlier that day – an [[elven]] [[priestess]] of [[Tymora]]. The group managed to survive the battle as Holga beheaded the beast, but not before he was hurt and cured by a ''[[healing potion]]''. The thieves followed through the opened passage and reached the dungeon's bestiary – a collection of cages with [[giant spider]]s, [[dire wolves]], [[kobold]]s, an [[amphisbaena]], and lastly, Torlinn Shrake... It was revealed that that the dragonborn wizard was defeated in a spell duel all those decades ago against the beholder [[Sharrestren]], who took on Torlinn's form and claimed his life in Neverwinter. The eye tyrant discovered the ''Staff of Aorth'' and hatched a plan to restore the damaged artifact to full power by feeding it positive emotions from weekly lavish parties and negative emotions from the death dungeon underneath.
