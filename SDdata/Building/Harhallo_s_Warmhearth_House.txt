Harhallos Warmhearth House was an inn located Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This establishment was located on the east side of North Way, a short walk south of Handrornlar, the northern gate in the walls of the Iron City. It was just south of Oraundro Nempeths rope and wire shop and Munsrums Ready Ladle. On its other side were hiring firms, a locator service, and a barrel maker.
This building was small compared to most buildings in Khôltar and showed its age. It was built by dwarves, for dwarves, to have privacy and quiet&mdashthe walls were more than 3 ft (90 cm) thick.
Harhallos did not have a dining area, but there was a common room with a massive fireplace where guests could smoke, drink, and chat. The architecture used many pillars with subdued lighting to make dwarves feel at home. The rugs and wall hangings were shabby and threadbare.
This inn was very popular in its heyday, but began a slow decline when Taurgaurs Tarjteir opened up just on the other side of the  wide intersection of North Way with Orntathtar Way. By 1372 DR, Harhallos averaged about twice as many human patrons as dwarf, and the clientele was noticeably older and/or penurious.
Room and board at Harhallos was 9 sp per night. This included a room with a bed, a bath, and a meal for the traveler, and a stall with water and straw (and a wash, if needed) for one mount or beast of burden. The meal brought to the guests room was typically slices of a plain roast, onion soup, and biscuits. Drinks in the common room could be had at extra cost. A tankard of beer or ale sold for 4 cp the limited selection of inexpensive wines were a bit more.
This inn had passed down through the generations twice&mdashYontur Harhallo was the third Harhallo to own and operate this house of welcome.
