Wainwrights Wagons was a renowned wagon-maker located in the town of Triboar during the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
The shop was located in the center of Triboar, right next to the market square.
Wainwrights comprised a horse-run mill, a number of storage outbuildings, and a fenced-off area.
During the 14 century DR, Skulner Wainwright produced the finest and most innovative wagons in the entire Dessarin Valley. They were quite popular among the nobility of the North. The starting price for one of Skulners wagons was 175 gp.
One of his designs included a wagon that was also used as a barge that floated along the River Dessarin.
As of the late 15 century, the shops owner Tosker employed a number of low-skilled apprentice wainwrights to produce over-priced, middling quality wagons.
