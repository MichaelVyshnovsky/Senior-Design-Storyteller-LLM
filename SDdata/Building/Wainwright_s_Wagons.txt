'''Wainwright's Wagons''' was a renowned [[wagon]]-maker located in the town of [[Triboar]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Location==
The shop was located in the center of Triboar, right next to the market square.

==Structure==
Wainwright's comprised a [[horse]]-run [[mill]], a number of storage outbuildings, and a fenced-off area.

==Services==
During the 14{{th}} century DR, [[Skulner Wainwright]] produced the finest and most innovative wagons in the entire [[Dessarin Valley]]. They were quite popular among the nobility of [[the North]]. The starting price for one of Skulner's wagons was 175 [[gp]].

One of his designs included a wagon that was also used as a [[barge]] that floated along the [[River Dessarin]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century, the shop's owner [[Tosker Wainwright|Tosker]] employed a number of low-skilled apprentice wainwrights to produce over-priced, middling quality wagons.
