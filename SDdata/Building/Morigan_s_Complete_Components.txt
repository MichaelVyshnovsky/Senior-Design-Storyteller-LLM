'''Morigan's Magical Components''' was a magic shop in [[Ravens Bluff]], in the lateâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], that was housed in the northern end of [[Kettle of Many Things]].

==Location==
This shop stood along [[Skulls Street (Ravens Bluff)|Skulls Street]], in the [[Swordpoint]] neighborhood of the city's [[Ravens Bluff/Temple District|Temple District]].

==Services==
This shop primarily dealt in [[material component]]s for [[spell]]s. While the owners found some success selling everyday components to local [[arcane]] [[spellcaster]]s, stiff competition from [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] forced the Morigans to refocus their wares to [[herbs]] and [[spices]], which they sold to local restaurants and housekeepers.

==Inhabitants==
The shop was run by a couple, [[Mijel Morigan|Mijel]] and [[Jandra Morigan]].
