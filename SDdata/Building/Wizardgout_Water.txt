'''Wizardgout Water''' was a fountain located in [[High Dale]]. It was the source of a stream that flowed down to [[Saerb]].

The fountain was actually a petrified wizard named [[Yalumvrael]] of [[Athkatla]] whose body was turned to stone and enspelled to produce an endless flow of water. Yalumvrael earned this fate after he attempted to slay the [[Magister]] [[Alvaerele Tasundrym]]. Yalumvrael's body was buried in a landslide, but the site retained its original name.<ref>
