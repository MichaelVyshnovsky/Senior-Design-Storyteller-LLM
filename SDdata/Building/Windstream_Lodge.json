        "mainbody": "Windstream Lodge was an outpost and guardhouse of the Hellriders of Elturel. It stood on Skuldask Road where it ran southeast of Elturel to Berdusk, in the Fields of the Dead. Windstream Lodge marked the southern limit of Elturels reach circa 1366 DR.\nLike all their Lodges, its purpose was to supply Hellrider patrols, with fresh mounts kept ready and stocks of food, water, weapons, and flammables on hand. Situated at strategic sites, these Lodges were protected by stockades and strong magical wards against arson and theft, which could be bypassed by certain ward tokens."
