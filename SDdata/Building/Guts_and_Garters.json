Quietude spied on guests for the [[Xanathar]]. The inn contained a secret door leading to a staircase that descended 20 feet to a magically lit rough-hewn tunnel that extended 300 feet west and connected to the Xanathar's secret dungeon lair.",
        "Prices and services": "Bolton Brimwell provided the following services: \n* Rooms per hour at 5 [[sp]]\n* Rooms for 10 hours at 5 [[gp]]\nFor a few extra coins, Brimwell would show patrons a secret passage to the alley near the Feathered Rat pet shop and provide a guard for added protection. \n* Information on secret passage to alley outside Feathered Rat for 1 gp\n* Services of guard for 1 gp\nQuietude rented bedrooms for 5 gp per day."
