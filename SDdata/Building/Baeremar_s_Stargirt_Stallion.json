        "mainbody": "'''Baeremar's Stargirt Stallion''' was an inn in [[Archtassel]] in [[Tasseldale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This quaint and quiet inn was located in such a way it provided a great view of the tassel for guests. Guests were treated with fresh soup made every morning. The inn was known for its collection of exotic [[tea]]s. If one was willing to part with their coin, they could add sweetened [[cocoa]] from [[Maztica]] to their beverage. Served with the tea were small biscuits and a selection of spreads made from butter mixed with local herbs and vegetables.\n\nThe inn displayed and sold items and crafts made by the residents of Archtassel. A pool behind the inn was warded against insects, allowing both guests and staff a chance to bathe or cool down in peace.\n\nThe inn was small and cramped, and only a dozen guests could stay at any given time. The inn did not see many travelers, locals were the primary patrons. The relief-carved sign that hung outside the inn was enchanted so the stars, which were just bumps in the wood, sparkled and twinkled."
