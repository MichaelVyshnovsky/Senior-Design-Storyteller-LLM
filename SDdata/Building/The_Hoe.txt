The Hoe was a cheap and seedy tavern in the city of Cedarsproke in the Gulthmere Forest of Vilhon Reach in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The city of Cedarsproke could be considered sleepy and serene by some, being inhabited mostly by druids who sought a peaceful life. However, the city held religious significance to the Church of Eldath and the Church of Silvanus, bringing many pilgrims to the druidic stronghold. Another locale that attracted guests was the Earthome College. It led to the spawning of half-a-dozen inns and taverns. The Hoe was among them. This cheap and seedy establishment could be found at the lakefront.
