The Temple of Helm of Nashkel was a small holy house dedicated to the veneration of the Watcher. It was overseen by the cleric Nalin around 1368 DR.
The temples architecture was noticeably different than the surrounding buildings of Nashkel. A small cemetery was built around its facade, with more than a dozen headstones erected within it. Among the people buried within the graveyard was DaerRagh, a mage who faked his own death.
