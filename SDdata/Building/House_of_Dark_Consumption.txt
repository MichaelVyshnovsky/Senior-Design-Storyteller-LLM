The '''House of Dark Consumption''' was a building located in the lower [[Deep Wastes]].

==Description==
The House of Dark Consumption was avoided by any creature, both living and constructs, with any sense. Even the [[undead]] avoided the house. Any who entered the structure were either killed or left in a such a weakened state they were easy prey for the many predators of the Underdark.

The House of Dark Consumption looked like a regular, unassuming stone house. Upon entering the front door, an individual was greeted with a dark icy interior. The inside was much larger than the exterior, an extra-dimensional maze of corridors, room and twisting turns. To make things interesting, the walls randomly rearranged themselves every once in a while. Paradoxically, the house was also a [[dead-magic zone]].

The interior was dark, so dark it dimmed any light source. The light from a [[torch]] only illuminated an area of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. Marking a way through the maze was impossible. Unattended equipment, including paint on walls, rotted away within hours. Equipment carried by a creature rotted away at a slower pace, with armor and weapons rusting away in several days.

Any creature who spent a full day inside had a significant risk of suffering the effects of an ''[[insanity]]'' spell.
