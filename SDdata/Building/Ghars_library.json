This included local history and folklore of Cormyr.

There were also drawers of old maps of Cormyr and surrounding lands, many detailed but out of date.\n\nAnyone could come to the library to read and research, but only permanent residents of Ghars were allowed to borrow books for a period of a couple of [[tenday]]s or so, provided they returned them on time. Perhaps unsurprisingly for its stock, the library was little-frequented, often not seeing a patron for days while it could be years between borrowings for individual books.",
        "Structure": "The library was small, little more than a large room added onto the town hall at some point. It had small windows, making it dim. It was also dusty and smelly, due to mildew arising from the damp outer wall and threatening the books. Marmwitz insisted on silence and not disturbing other patrons, if there were any.",

        "History": "[[Mrs. Barnabas Hinkel]] borrowed a book on local history from the library in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}. Seven years later, that book had yet to be borrowed again. Similar books had been waiting even longer.\n\nThe traveling king's envoy [[Grodoveth]] started visiting the library in [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, researching the [[Vast Swamp]] and the legends of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]].\n\nOn [[Eleint 17]], [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the library to return ''The Internal Structure of the Brachiopod'' on behalf of [[Benelaius]] and questioned Grodoveth and Marmwitz about recent research, as part of his investigation into [[Dovo]]'s murder. Marmwitz was irritated at Jasper for disturbing Grodoveth in his research. He returned [[Eleint 18|the next day]] for follow-up questions."
