        "mainbody": "'''Derval's Smithy''' was the most prominent blacksmith's shop found in the town of [[Daggerford]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was originally owned by the town's famous blacksmith, [[Derval Ironeater|Derval]] of [[Clan Ironeater]], and was eventually passed down to his grandson [[Ignal Ironeater|Ignal]].",
        "Location": "The building was located in the town's [[River Quarter]].",
        "Services": "While Ignal and his apprentice smiths forged weapons in the style of Derval for private sale, they focused most of their work to aid the town. They made many metal items, such as [[spear]] and [[arrow]] heads, for use by the [[Daggerford militia]].",
        "History": "Derval's original business in Daggerford was the shop known as [[Derval's Bright Blade]]. He was known as the finest smith among those in Daggerford, and the weapons he made were of the finest quality.\n\nAt some point, the smithy was relocated from Daggerford's [[Money Quarter]] to the River Quarter on the south side of town."
