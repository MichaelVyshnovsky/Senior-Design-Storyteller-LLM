'''Woumar's Wheloon Mill''' was a mill located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. Its proprietor was [[Leahon Woumar]].

==Description==
The mill was a large and imposing stone structure by the west bank of the [[Wyvernflow]], near the center of Wheloon. It was regularly noisy and busy.The mill's location by the river would imply that it is a water-powered mill.

==History==
Woumar's Wheloon Mill was once operated by Woumar's father, before being taken over by Leahon Woumar himself prior to [[1358 DR]].

Leahon made several improvements to his father's mill, such as including separate runs for simultaneous milling and pulping of different products.

It was still in operation by [[1369 DR]].

==Services==
Woumar's Wheloon Mill was a [[gristmill]] that ground grain into flour, such as [[barley]], [[corn]], and wheat. It could also pulp vegetable greens, bones, and other scraps into a fertilizer for fields. It served farmers all around Wheloon.

The mill had an upper room that offered a good view of the Wyvernflow river. Some people liked to spend time there, sitting and gaming until late at night. Some of the local [[Purple Dragons]] suspected they kept a lookout for smugglers approaching by boat under cover of night.
