'''Tower Reilloch''' was a tower on the northern coast of the island of [[Evermeet]] and home to [[Araevin Teshurr]] and the [[Circle of Reilloch Domayr]].

==Defenses==
It was guarded by the [[Queen's Guards]] since the attack on the island in [[1371 DR]]. The tower was of stone construction with battlements and was surrounded by [[fir]] and [[spruce]] trees.

==Interior==
;Great hall: The great hall had doors of [[blueleaf]] wood bound with [[mithral]], and a dome of mithral and [[theurglass]] on top. It was the usual meeting place of the Circle of Reilloch Domayr.
;Conservatory: The conservatory occupied the whole of the upper floor of the gatehouse and had high ceilings, an [[oak]] floor, and paneled walls of [[cherry]], carved with scenes of [[sylvan]] creatures. It was normally used as a [[bard]]ic recital hall.
;Vaults: The vaults of the Tower contained many rare and precious artifacts and magical devices. Some vaults were deep in the Tower's foundations, but others existed only in extradimensional spaces. The most valuable and dangerous items were stored in vaults protected by lethal traps.
;Nandiyerron's Armory: The armory was built by the archmage [[Nandiyerron]] ''circa'' [[374 DR]] (a thousand years before [[1374 DR]]). It lay underneath the Tower, behind an [[iron]] and [[adamantine]] door. It contained one of the three shards of the [[Gatekeeper's Crystal]] until it was stolen in an attack in [[1374 DR]], when Eldest [[Philaerin]] was slain in its defense.
