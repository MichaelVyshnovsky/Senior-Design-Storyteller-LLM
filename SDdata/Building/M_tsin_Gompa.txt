'''M'tsin Gompa''' was a monastery (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It stood in northwestern Tabot, near the border and a short way northeast of [[Nad Ho Ting]] Lake.

==Description==
M'tsin Gompa was a small and peaceful place spread across a terraced mountainside. It was renowned for its natural wells and pools stocked with [[koi]], which were considered sacred. Among the pools were lots of shrines and devotion poles.

==Members==
The population was small, with only 340 lamas. They were known for their quiet and harmonious nature, but also their mighty [[magic]]. They had easy control over the weather and the elements and used such forces in battle.

==Activities==
The lamas cared for and contemplated the koi and also mined for [[gold]] in the mountains north of Nad Ho Ting. Some estimated them to be the wealthiest gompa in all Tabot, though if was the case, then they showed no sign of it, so they might be the most parsimonious of them too.

==History==
It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of M'tsin.

In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, a fire razed over half of the nearby city of [[Fij]] and left countless people homeless. The M'tsin lamas sent workers and emergency relief to Fij in an effort to rebuild before the cold winter month of Maki.<ref>
