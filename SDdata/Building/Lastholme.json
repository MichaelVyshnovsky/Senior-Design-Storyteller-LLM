        "Activities": "This temple was a frequent visitor among people, especially farmers, for its well made [[mead]]. The temple also engaged in a trade of a variety of different food and drinks. Later on it began operating an orphanage to take care of the many children who lost their families to war, eventually having to expand the temple in order to further accommodate them.",
        "Inhabitants": "This temple was presided over by a clergy of eight priests, lead by the High Priest [[Brom Hlast]]. Around [[1358 DR]] they were known to have around 55 followers within the city."
