'''Dressed to the Nines''' was a men's clothing store and haberdashery that was found in [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood of the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]. They maintained a high exclusivity and the store's owner, the haughty [[Jordan Whipt]], preferred to cater to the [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|nobility]] of the city.

The store specialized in the sale of custom-ordered uniforms. Many adventurers and [[rogue]]s would use the store's services as a source of disguises, much to Jordan's irritation.

==Description==
The store featured a signboard that displayed a Ravenian soldier standing at full attention. The Nines' doorman wore matching attire.
