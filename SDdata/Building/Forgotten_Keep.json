        "mainbody": "The '''Forgotten Keep''' was a ruined [[Netherese]] lookout tower{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|45}}",
        "Location": "The Forgotten Keep stood to the northeast from the town of [[Eveningstar]], east of the [[Starwater River]], and a shorter distance southwest of [[Redspring]]. The area was a sparsely-wooded wilderness crossed with deep stream-gullies and ravines, similar to the rest of the southern Stonelands.[[Helmlands]]",
        "Structure": "The only thing that was left of the structure by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] was its round walls. The lookout tower's shell included a simple dwelling. Both were erected over a subterranean ''[[gate]]'' within a natural cavern that also served as a source of drinking water, refilling every spring.",
        "Inhabitants": "By the 14{{th}} century DR, the Forgotten Keep had been long abandoned and used as a lair by beasts and monsters. [[Bear]]s and [[owlbear]]s were known to make the ruins their home, and its cellars hid a [[gibbering mouther]] that once belonged to the [[wizard]]-master of the keep. The aberration was just one of the keep's many defenders, altered by that unnamed wizard. The gibbering mouther was granted [[spell]]-like abilities allowing it to use the underground ''gate'' to travel to new feeding spots.\n\nIn [[1486 DR]], the [[Shadovar]] of [[Thultanthar]] used the ''gate'' in the Keep to launch their invasion of Cormyr. This allowed Lady [[Marsheena]]'s army to bypass the fortifications on Cormyr's border such as [[Castle Crag]] and [[High Horn]], and her forces marched almost unchallenged across Cormyr to besiege [[Arabel]], [[Marsember]], and [[Suzail]].{{Cite digital book/Fire in the Blood|?|21}} By [[Uktar]] of the year, the invasion force was broken and the sieges lifted, and the [[War Wizards]] had disabled the ''gate'' in the Keep to prevent any retreat or reinforcements.{{Cite digital book/Fire in the Blood|?|30}}"
