century DR
The Wailing Wave was one of the busiest and wildest inns and taverns on the Sword Coast, favored by those seeking to make some shady dealings, located in the village of Lathtarls Lantern, which was situated south of the Winding Water river.
From the outside, the Wailing Wave appeared to be nothing but an ordinary rundown roadhouse, but the buildings purpose became obvious once one noticed that the stables in the back were converted into two rental lodgings.
The tavern was known for being filled with pipe smoke and rowdy customers of all types pirates, sailors, smugglers, slavers, and even ogres, gnolls, and half-monster-breed clientele, thanks to the towns general obscurity and difficulty of access. Typical entertainment included a fiddler, zither player, and a drummer.
The tavern and an inn offered ramshackle lodgings to its guests and stayed in business thanks to being the only place a traveler could find shelter from perilous marshes, bandits, and trolls. However, despite its lacking of accommodations, the inns main amenity was its bar. Its taproom was packed nightly by people who made a journey by boat just to partake in the revelries, talk business, and enjoy the wide selection of beverages on offer some said to be the widest selection all along the Sword Coast. The business remained open until 2 a.m. daily. Everyone was welcome unless they wanted to enforce the law or preach some deitys worship.
Red-dog rum was a cheap rum on the taverns menu.
The Wailing Wave was a colorful name inspired by a local legend that on some moonlit nights, one could hear the sorrowful cries of the drowned in the sound of the waves that washed over Lathtarls Lanterns pebble beaches.
Before the mid-14 century DR, one regular customer of the inn was Old Jason McCully, a terror of the sea, who died by hanging in Neverwinter, but not before spitting in the executioners eye.
