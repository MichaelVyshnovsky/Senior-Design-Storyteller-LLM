        "mainbody": "he Inn of Wayward Sages was a cozy, but rundown inn found in the Northbank of Silverymoon. It was located on the northwest corner of the city block where Bowshot Ride met the Ghostwalk.This specific location refers to the Wayward House, which was built over the ruins of the Inn of Wayward Sages.\nWhile the inns food was particularly tasty, its furnishings were old and far from comfortable. The whole building had a persistent chill that even a roaring fireplace could not fully alleviate.\nSome time shortly before 1366 DR, the inn was badly damaged in a fire and had to be (at least partially) rebuilt. Yet again, between then and 1372 DR, it was completely destroyed in another blaze. After the second time the inn ran ablaze, it was completely rebuilt in the same location and renamed the Wayward House.\nThere were several local stories as to how the inn acquired its name. The most common explanation was that the inn was simply a favored rest stop for sages to get away from their studies and enjoy the tastes and talk of the town. \nA more ribald tale was the persistent rumor that the inn was built and financed by the famously beautiful escort Meereldil Shorncrown. Her clientele, interestingly enough was primarily sages from the local magical colleges and devoted followers from the temple of Oghma. Lending credence to this story, Meereldil did spend her last days within the inn, and a woman by the name of Jhalessa Shorncrown did serve as chamberlain of the Wayward House."
