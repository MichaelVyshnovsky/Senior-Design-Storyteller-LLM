The '''River Gate''' was the eastern point of entrance through the [[Trollwall]] into [[Waterdeep]], City of Splendors.

==Description==
The gate featured a single tower on either side of [[River Street]]. Each tower stood four stories tall.

==Location==
The River Gate was found in eastern Waterdeep in the southeast section of the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Dead Trades Ward}}

==Law & Order==
Any large caravan that wished to enter through River Gate had to register with one of the [[Magisters of Waterdeep]], who was always accompanied by members of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. Small parties and individuals only had to register with one if their stay extended beyond a [[tenday]]. In both cases, discovery of a failure to do so would result in either a fine or being put to forced labor.

==Defenses==
Prior to the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, as a defensive measure one of the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] were stationed beneath the River Gate and hidden away on the [[Ethereal plane]]. It actively defended against ethereal intrusion, attacking any ethereal creatures it perceived within Waterdeep's bounds, but would ignore ethereal [[humanoid]]s unless there was a group of ten or more of them. In 1385 DR, it and six of the other hidden Walking Statues exited the Ethereal plane and left their positions to rampage across the city.
