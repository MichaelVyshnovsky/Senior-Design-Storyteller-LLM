The '''Crypt of Vers Never''' was a tomb located in the [[Pauper's Section]] of [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]].The name of the crypt is misspelled as belonging to "Vars" Never in ''[[Neverwinter (game)|Neverwinter]]''. It was presumed to have been built for [[Vers Never]], the ancestor of Lord [[Dagult Neverember]].

==History==
The unassuming tomb was identified as the crypt of Vers Never around the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, by [[Retrigal Bookbinder]], a scholar working to validate Lord Neverember's claim of descent from [[Nasher Alagondar]]. As Vers was known to have settled in [[Waterdeep]], Retrigal presumed that the crypt would be empty, however he hoped that it might still contain something of interest (such as records of Vers Never's lineage). After identifying the crypt, Retrigal sought to enlist the help of an [[adventurer]] to neutralize any [[undead]] near it.
