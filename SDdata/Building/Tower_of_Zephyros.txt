The '''Tower of Zephyros''' was a [[Cloud palace|floating tower]] belonging to the [[cloud giant]] [[wizard]] [[Zephyros]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Exterior==
The Tower of Zephyros was hundreds of feet tall, and rested on a magically solid cloud. The spire of the tower was shaped like a pointed [[wizard|wizard's]] hat.

==Interior==
The interior of the Tower of Zephyros comprised three stories, each built to gigantic proportions and filled with [[giant]]-sized furniture. Each story was connected by a 20-foot-wide (6.1 meters) hole in the ceiling/floor.

The first floor contained the giant's sitting room, while the second contained his bedchambers and the ''[[navigation orb]]'' that [[Zephyros]] used to control the movement of the tower. The third floor of the tower was an open-air aerie. Several [[griffon]]s made their home in this level.

==History==
Some time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tower was visited by a detachment of cultists from the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] in an attempt to recruit Zephyros to its causes.

A matter of days later, [[Dagnabbet Waybeard|Queen Waybeard]] of [[Mithral Hall]] sent the [[silver dragon]] [[Clarion (dragon)|Clarion]] and a [[Lords' Alliance]] strike team to attack the tower.
