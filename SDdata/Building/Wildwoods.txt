Wildwoods was a mansion located in the Kings Forest near Waymoot in Cormyr.
The original owner of the mansion was a wizard named Orthaerus Manycloaks. Orthaerus was slain during a spell-duel by the traveling wizard Endarthar, who then assumed ownership of the estate.
After his death, the ghost of Orthaerus still resided within the mansion, jumping on any opportunity to make Endarthars life miserable.
