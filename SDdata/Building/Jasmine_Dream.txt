The Jasmine Dream was an opulent inn found in the city of Dihliz in 1367 DR.
Perhaps because of the unparalleled level of cleanliness to be found within, the Jasmine Dream was a popular spot for wealthy merchants traveling throughout the Pantheon cities. Many of the inns rooms provided a pleasant view overlooking the canal in Dihliz.
The inn was owned by a gnome named Ahmad.
