        "mainbody": "Flirins Sea Morsels, formerly known as Flirins Sushi Bar, was a sushi restaurant in the city of Ravens Bluff.\nThis restaurant was situated along the southern end of the Front, in the Silverscales neighborhood of Ravens Bluffs Harbor District. It stood two doors down from Ashakars Accessories and Ornagars Smoked Eels & More.\nFlirins was a two-story building, with the first floor being used for business and the second used as a living quarters by the proprietor.\nIn its early days of operation the restaurant was quite small, consisting of a single room divided by a wide L-shaped counter and only seating eleven customers at a time. The room was whitewashed and had a large window that was usually left open, allowing the sea breeze to waft in, though it was shut at night and during inclement weather. Beneath the wide counter sacks and baskets full of ingredients were alongside a locked cash box. Further behind the counter stood a small storeroom, obscured by a curtain, where fish and wine were stored and a small ladder led to the second floor. All fish was kept cool with ice from the Dock Ice House.\nEventually the business made enough funds to expand its size,It is not specified in The City of Ravens Bluff how the business had expanded since its early days of operation, but Port of Ravens Bluff states that Flirin would \"...need to buy the adjoining building...\" if she wanted to expand her business. Therefore it stands to reason this is what most likely occurred. By that point Flirins had more room to seat a greater number of customers, in rooms that were rather plain but spotless. The expansion also gave the business a cellar, where aquatic tanks would be installed so as to allow for an even greater degree of freshness with the aquatic fare on offer.\nThe living quarters on the second floor were sparsely furnished and covered with straw mats. It featured a wardrobe with a secret compartment, a battered sea chest, a bed and cradle, and a desk and chair where the businesss accounting was done. Near the desk stood a fish tank housing small, brightly colored fish that had been gifted by a merman. One drawer of the desk contained writing supplies such as paper, quills, and ink while the other held an account book and a box. The box contained a small portion of her finances and was trapped with sleeping gas.\nFlirins opened around highsun and would operate until about three hours after dusk. It served eye-catching and delectable sushi dishes made from rice, seaweed, vegetables, raw or steamed fish, and oysters. There was no standardized menu on offer, as the aquatic fare was brought fresh at the fish market each day and thus was dependent upon whatever was available. Food was offered in either appetizer or dinner portions for 2 and 5 gp respectively. Free bite-sized samples were also offered.\nUnlike most restaurants, the food on offer at Flirins was prepared in front of customers, resulting in an elaborate exhibition of twirling and chopping knives that attracted as much attention as the food. Any cooking of food was done upon a small brazier.\nAll food was served atop fine lacquerware from Kara-Tur alongside a flower in a vase. For beverages the patrons had the option to partake in either plum wine or rice wine, costing 1 gp and 8 sp respectively, which could be heated upon the shops brazier. Flirins also offered a number of seaweed sauces made from the proprietors own secret recipes.\nThe restaurant opened around the , after the founder had sold most of her jewels in order to afford the building. When it began many were turned off by the food on offer, forcing the owner to practically give samples away just to get passers-by to try it. Overtime the locals came around to the idea of sushi and by 1361 DR the business had become quite popular. At that time she had ambitions to expand the size of her eatery, but lacked the necessary funds to do so.Port of Ravens Bluff (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles OKane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR. Sometime before 1370 DR she managed to raise the necessary funds to achieve her goals and changed the businesss name to Flirins Sea Morsels.\nFlirins was widely considered to be the most fashionable eatery in the Port District. Nobles, local Ravenians, sailors, merchants, the wealthy, and men in general would flock to the shop to either eat or simply watch the proprietor cook. No other business in the Silverscales achieved such a degree of popularity with the elite. Even the citys Lord Mayor, Charles Oliver OKane, was occasionally seen waiting in line. And because of its popularity, there was almost always a line of patrons in front of Flirins.\nIn its early years of operation the business was solely operated by its namesake owner Flirin. She lived in the building with her young daughter Adularia.\nAfter the business made enough funds to expand into the adjoining building, Flirin hired a staff of halflings to help serve customers. They were known to sometimes run along the table-tops whenever the eatery got particularly busy."
