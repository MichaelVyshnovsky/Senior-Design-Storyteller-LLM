Shandras farm was a house in the Mere of Dead Men.
Shandras farm was located near Highcliff.
Like the other houses in Highcliff, Shandras farm was made from stone, wood and straw.
The interior is large, with many rooms, including a bedroom and a storage.
When the Kalach-Cha came to Shandra Jerro for the first time to ask about the lizardfolk, the lizards managed to burn down her barn. The second time Kalach-Cha came to save Shandra from the githyanki, her house was burned, so she joined the Kalach-Cha. The third time the Kalach-Cha came was due to Ammon Jerro paying respects at the farm for her granddaughter. The Kalach-Cha had to help him defeat one of the demons he held in his Haven. Once finished, Ammon would blast a crate to get a weapon he wanted to give to Shandra.
