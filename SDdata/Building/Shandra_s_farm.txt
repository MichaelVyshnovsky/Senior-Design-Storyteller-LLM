'''Shandra's farm''' was a house in the [[Mere of Dead Men]].

==Location==
[[Shandra Jerro|Shandra]]'s farm was located near [[Highcliff]].

==Structure==
Like the other houses in Highcliff, Shandra's farm was made from stone, wood and straw.

==Interior==
The interior is large, with many rooms, including a bedroom and a storage.

==History==
When the [[Kalach-Cha]] came to Shandra Jerro for the first time to ask about the [[lizardfolk]], the lizards managed to burn down her barn. The second time Kalach-Cha came to save Shandra from the [[githyanki]], her house was burned, so she joined the Kalach-Cha. The third time the Kalach-Cha came was due to [[Ammon Jerro]] paying respects at the farm for her granddaughter. The Kalach-Cha had to help him defeat one of the demons he held in his Haven. Once finished, Ammon would blast a crate to get a weapon he wanted to give to Shandra.
