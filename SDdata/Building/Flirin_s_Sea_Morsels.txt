'''Flirin's Sea Morsels''',{{Cite interactive atlas|4750 Raven's Bluff}} formerly known as '''Flirin's Sushi Bar''',{{Cite organized play/LC/A Wedding Summons in Ravens Bluff|6}} was a [[sushi]] restaurant in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].

==Location==
This restaurant was situated along the southern end of [[the Front]], in the [[Silverscales]] neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]]. It stood two doors down from [[Ashakar's Accessories]] and [[Ornagar's Smoked Eels & More]].

==Structure==
Flirin's was a two-story building, with the first floor being used for business and the second used as a living quarters by the proprietor.

===Interior===
In its early days of operation the restaurant was quite small, consisting of a single room divided by a wide L-shaped counter and only seating eleven customers at a time. The room was [[whitewash]]ed and had a large window that was usually left open, allowing the sea breeze to waft in, though it was shut at night and during inclement weather. Beneath the wide counter [[sack]]s and [[basket]]s full of ingredients were alongside a locked cash box. Further behind the counter stood a small storeroom, obscured by a curtain, where [[fish]] and [[wine]] were stored and a small [[ladder]] led to the second floor. All fish was kept cool with ice from the [[Dock Ice House]].

Eventually the business made enough funds to expand its size,It is not specified in ''The City of Ravens Bluff'' how the business had expanded since its early days of operation, but ''Port of Ravens Bluff'' states that Flirin would "...need to buy the adjoining building..." if she wanted to expand her business. Therefore it stands to reason this is what most likely occurred. By that point Flirin's had more room to seat a greater number of customers, in rooms that were rather plain but spotless. The expansion also gave the business a cellar, where aquatic tanks would be installed so as to allow for an even greater degree of freshness with the aquatic fare on offer.

The living quarters on the second floor were sparsely furnished and covered with straw mats. It featured a wardrobe with a secret compartment, a battered sea chest, a bed and cradle, and a desk and chair where the business's accounting was done. Near the desk stood a fish tank housing small, brightly colored fish that had been gifted by a [[merman]]. One drawer of the desk contained writing supplies such as [[paper]], [[quill]]s, and [[ink]] while the other held an account [[book]] and a box. The box contained a small portion of her finances and was trapped with [[sleeping gas]].

==Services==
Flirin's opened around [[highsun]] and would operate until about three hours after dusk. It served eye-catching and delectable [[sushi]] dishes made from [[rice]], [[seaweed]], vegetables, raw or steamed fish, and [[oyster]]s. There was no standardized menu on offer, as the aquatic fare was brought fresh at the fish market each day and thus was dependent upon whatever was available. Food was offered in either appetizer or dinner portions for 2 and 5 [[gp]] respectively. Free bite-sized samples were also offered.

Unlike most restaurants, the food on offer at Flirin's was prepared in front of customers, resulting in an elaborate exhibition of twirling and chopping knives that attracted as much attention as the food. Any cooking of food was done upon a small [[brazier]].

All food was served atop fine [[lacquer]]ware from [[Kara-Tur]] alongside a flower in a vase. For beverages the patrons had the option to partake in either [[plum wine]] or [[rice wine]], costing 1 gp and 8 [[sp]] respectively, which could be heated upon the shop's [[brazier]]. Flirin's also offered a number of seaweed sauces made from the proprietor's own secret recipes.

==History==
The restaurant opened around the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, after the founder had sold most of her [[jewel]]s in order to afford the building. When it began many were turned off by the food on offer, forcing the owner to practically give samples away just to get passers-by to try it. Overtime the locals came around to the idea of sushi and by [[1361 DR]] the business had become quite popular. At that time she had ambitions to expand the size of her eatery, but lacked the necessary funds to do so.''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR. Sometime before [[1370 DR]] she managed to raise the necessary funds to achieve her goals and changed the business's name to Flirin's Sea Morsels.

==Reputation==
Flirin's was widely considered to be the most fashionable eatery in the Port District. Nobles, local Ravenians, sailors, merchants, the wealthy, and men in general would flock to the shop to either eat or simply watch the proprietor cook. No other business in the Silverscales achieved such a degree of popularity with the elite. Even the city's Lord Mayor, [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]], was occasionally seen waiting in line. And because of its popularity, there was almost always a line of patrons in front of Flirin's.

==Inhabitants==
In its early years of operation the business was solely operated by its namesake owner [[Flirin]]. She lived in the building with her young daughter [[Adularia]].

After the business made enough funds to expand into the adjoining building, Flirin hired a staff of [[halfling]]s to help serve customers. They were known to sometimes run along the table-tops whenever the eatery got particularly busy.
