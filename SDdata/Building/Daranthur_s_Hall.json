        "mainbody": "Daranthurs Hall was a \"shared-roof\" market located in downtown Athkatla, in the nation of Amn, during the 15 century DR.\nThe market was severely damaged during an attempt to uncover a smuggling ring within the city. Storl Thammuraster, Amaront of Selgaunt, and Onth Tarralus of Silverymoon used a gem-exploding spell to detonate the gems hidden in bottles, causing a series of explosions that killed dozens of traders and shoppers. After calling additional contacts, three merchant families—the Aerlonds, Kravalondurs, and Morornds—were exposed as smugglers."
