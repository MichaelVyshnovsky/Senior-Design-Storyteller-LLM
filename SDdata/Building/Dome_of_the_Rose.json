        "mainbody": "The '''Dome of the Rose''' was a [[monastery]] and temple to [[Lathander]] in the [[Gem District (Athkatla)|Gem District]] of [[Athkatla]].\n\nThe temple was run by a [[Mornmaster]], who was aided by eight [[cleric]]s. The clergy maintained the holy site as an oasis of austere serenity amid the flurry of commerce and activity within the rest of the city. It served as a haven where the faithful of Lathander could rest, meditate and worship in peace.",
        "Description": {
            "Ground floor": ":The ground floor of the temple was wider than the upper levels, by at least the size of a room all around. The north and western sides of the ground floor contained storage cellars while the south-east section had a glass-roofed conservatory.\n\nVisitors were allowed in to the temple through the west and north entrances, while [[monk]]s entered via the gardens in the east and south.",
            "2{{nd}} floor": ":The sweeping, circular walls curved up from the ground floor to the narrow upper levels of the ''Rose''. The ceiling of the second floor was nearly twice the height of an average house within the city.",
            "3{{rd}} floor": ":The topmost floor contained the ''Rose's'' main atrium, which was illuminated in radiance shining through the rose-colored from its namesake dome."
        },
        "Services": "While the temple granted Athkatlan Lathanderites a haven to pray and find solace, only [[pilgrim]]s from far off lands and high-ranking [[priest]]s and priestesses of the Morning Lord who were staying in the city less than a month were given room and board within the ''Dome of the Rose''.\n\n{{sectstub}}",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-14{{th}} cenutry [[DR]], Mornmaster [[Thaddin Dawnhunter]] was the leading priest at the temple. He was a quiet, pious priest with little trade-sense. He was aided by the shrewd, former-[[pirate]], Brother [[Haladso]] and Sister [[Moraeda Dawnduth]], who was said to be \"touch by the god\" by the Lathanderite clergy who raised her as an orphan."
