        "mainbody": "The '''Markhouse''' was an exceptionally fine inn located in [[Tegal's Mark]] within [[Tasseldale]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "While the rooms of the Markhouse weren't exceptionally large, or as luxurious as those in say [[Waterdeep]], they were of remarkably high quality for a roadside inn. This excellent standard was even maintained by [[Grand Mairshar]] [[Elizzaria Whitehand|Whitehand]] during her rule.",
        "Services": "One room for a night cost 1 [[gp]] and included board, stabling, and bottles of [[evenfeast wine]]. [[Muffin]]s and chilled [[juice]] were provided in the sitting room and every suite included a bathtub with running water, maid services, and news criers who came to each room. These reporters were pleasant youths who would recount local and more widespread information about the lands every hour."
