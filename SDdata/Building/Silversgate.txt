The '''Silversgate''' was an archway ''[[portal]]'' in [[Myth Drannor]] that connected the city to the [[High Forest]] region of [[the North]].

==Location==
It was located on [[Kurvhan's Way]], in the [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Old City]] district of Myth Drannor.

==Structure==
The gate was a tall archway made of stone and [[silver]].

==Activities==
The ''portal'' transported anyone who passed through the archway to the [[Silverymoon Pass]]. It originally opened up directly to the city of [[Ascalhorn]], but the destination was changed to allow easier access to [[Silverymoon]] itself.

It was guarded at all hours by members of the [[Coronal Guard]] to regulate passage and ensure nothing dangerous came through the other side.
