The Silversgate was an archway portal in Myth Drannor that connected the city to the High Forest region of the North.
It was located on Kurvhans Way, in the Old City district of Myth Drannor.
The gate was a tall archway made of stone and silver.
The portal transported anyone who passed through the archway to the Silverymoon Pass. It originally opened up directly to the city of Ascalhorn, but the destination was changed to allow easier access to Silverymoon itself.
It was guarded at all hours by members of the Coronal Guard to regulate passage and ensure nothing dangerous came through the other side.
