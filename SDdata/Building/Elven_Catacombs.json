The top catacomb levels were used as barracks during the times of war, held countless elven burial chambers and crypts, storage, veering sprawling dungeon tunnels, as well as prisons.\nThrough the numerous twisting and veering secret passages, the Elven Catacombs connected Cable Cormanthor to numerous locations of the City Heights of Myth Drannor, and led into the chamber of the pool of radiance.\nThe pool of radiance chamber was hidden behind a secret door, and other passages led through the catacombs towards many exits at the Shaundakuls Throne, lrithlium, Tyrimars Hall, and other locations in the ruined city.> A magical entrance was created to allow creatures carrying the Wizards Torc to instantaneously be transported to the Catacombs First Cellar from the Circle of Ualair the Silent in Speculum Grounds.\nthumb|One of several shrines of the Elven Catacombs.|330x330px\nThe Elven Catacombs consisted of four major levels the First Cellar, the Second Cellar, the Lower Keep, and the Prisons. Each level was separated by long stair-filled tunnels that could reach up to a hundred steps. The deeper one descended into the depths of catacombs, the stuffier and murkier the air was. In the centuries that followed the Weeping War, the lower levels made its visitors feel unease with their unwholesome atmosphere and almost palpable dread.\nA series of subterranean suits could be found in the First Cellar. These chambers were once used by the city of Myth Drannor to temporarily house important dwarven dignitaries and visitors to the City of Songs. The catacombs held several shrines dedicated to various gods, including the ever-burning Shrine of the Silver Fire, dedicated to Mystra. One of these sirens was desecrated in 1369 DR and turned into a makeshift Temple of Lolth by the drow invaders.\nA wine cellar could be found in the Second Cellar of the elven dungeon. Below the Second Cellar laid the Lower Keep. This level was primarily used to bury the greatest dwarven and elven defenders and heroes of Myth Drannor. The old tombs were decorated with masterful carvings, and its halls were framed with massive statues of heroes of old.\nFollowing the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War, the Elven Catacombs, like the Dwarven Dungeons, were sealed off with magic to stop looting and desecration. However, with centuries that passed, the Catacombs became unsealed in several places, secret entrances became discovered, and a huge chasm opened up, allowing the creatures of Underdark entrance into the ruins.\nBy 1369 DR, the Elven Catacombs became a haunting ground for various undead creatures and infested with deadly arraccats and margoyles. That year marked the time when the Cult of the Dragon, led by Kya Mordrayn and her dracolich ally Pelendralaar, conquered the ruins of the City of Song and was using Castle Cormanthor as their base. The Cult of the Dragon used the Elven Catacombs as barracks for themselves and their dragonkin servants. The Cult utilized the prison in the lower levels of the Catacombs. There, they kept prisoners and performed unholy tortures and rituals. During the same period of rime, drow houses of Freth and Kilsek found a way into the catacombs. They started opening old crypts and smuggling ancient elven magical items back to the Underdark. Freth drow allied with the Cult of the dragons and sold House Kilsek out in exchange for the cess to all the treasures of Myth Drannor. House Freth claimed the two lower levels of the Catacombs, while Kilsek drow was drained of their blood, souls, and their bodies were used as undead servants of the Cult.\nThe Cults activities attracted a group of adventurers led by a hero of Shadowdale - Athan. The adventurers were armed with Gauntlets of Moander and sent to the ruined City of Song by Elminster. However, shortly after arriving, Athans gang was ambushed by the Cult, and most of them were slaughtered. Athan himself was kept alive and tortured in the prisons of the Elven Catacombs. Eventually, a group of heroes known as the Veiled Ones rescued the failed leader, killed the treacherous Freth leaders, and forced the Cult out of the ruins.\nthumb|Depths of the Elven Catacombs and the Underdark chasm.|330x330px\n*Aasirak an ancient lich who laired in the Catacombs First Cellar.\n*Miroden Silverblade a baelnorn and the sworn protector of Myth Drannors mythal.\n*Sleethur a powerful dark naga who laired in the Lower Keep among dwarwish tombs.\n*Thyaast Ammath once brilliant elf wizard who transformed herself into a mad spectral lich, dwelt in the deepest level of the Elven Catacombs in her ancient laboratory, across the hall from the charm that led directly to the Underdark."
