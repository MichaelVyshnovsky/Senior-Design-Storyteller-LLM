The '''Wheloon Moothouse''' was a meeting hall located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. It stood on Wheloon Way, opposite [[Oldstone Hall]].

The moothouse served as Wheloon's courthouse and a hall for meetings. It also contained apartments for visiting court messengers and high-ranking [[Purple Dragon]]s.

The building was constructed of timber and stone. It was built wide and with few internal walls or furniture to allow as many people as possible to gather inside.
