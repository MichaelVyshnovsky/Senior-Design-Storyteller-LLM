        "mainbody": "'''Rallogar Hardware''', or '''Rallogar's Hardware''', was a hardware store located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. Its proprietor was [[Zendaros Rallogar]].",
        "Location": "Rallogar Hardware was situated opposite the [[Wheloon Watch House]], and on the corner of [[Wheloon|Wheloon Way]] and the [[Way of the Manticore]].",
        "History": "The building was once a stables before being converted into a hardware store. Rallogar Hardware was in business by [[1358 DR]]. It was still in business through [[1369 DR]], and in [[1374 DR]].\n\nRallogar Hardware provided supplies monthly to the newly built [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]]. Lady of Mystery [[Naedaenya Arthas]] was writing to negotiate better rates in early [[Eleint]].",
        "Structure & Interior": "The building still resembled an old and dusty stables, including a hayloft stuffed with old junk.",
        "Services": "The store sold a variety of hardware goods. These ranged from rusty scrap metal to new metal goods, such as nails. Among them was a full range of hooks, from small, fine hooks for hanging masks and wigs, to big barge hooks. Zendaros made sure to keep good stocks of [[rope]] and [[wire]], of all lengths and thicknesses, from strangling wire to thick ship towing [[cable]]s. These were sold as small pieces or by the bale, and there were huge drums of 1000-foot-long (305-meter-long) hempen rope for sale too. Zendaros made good business selling rope and wire to merchants who needed to tie cargo down. Miscellaneous other goods for sale included [[hair comb]]s, [[backpack]]s, [[wineskin]]s, and almost everything else. The store did not, however, sell [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], with these trades left to other stores.\n\nRallogar Hardware also did not buy or sell [[magic item]]s, ostensibly because Zendaros despised magic. Customers who asked were forced out of the store. However, Zendaros actually ran a prosperous black market trade in magic items, weapons, armor and so on. One of his employees later approached the curious customer to broker a deal.\n\nThe stock was mostly unorganized, bar the rope and wire, so finding a specific item could be lengthy and tedious. It was described as a browser's paradise.\n\nDesperate people sometimes paid Zendaros well to let them hide in the hayloft, to either avoid a [[Purple Dragon]] patrol or eavesdrop on others."
