Karokrath was a large githzerai outpost on Toril as of the late 15 century DR.
The strongholds location was a secret, but it was located somewhere within the badlands of Xian in Faer√ªn.
From Karokrath, the githzerai deployed scouts and spies to monitor both the mind flayer city of Oryndoll&mdashlocated in the Underdark beneath the outpost&mdashand the githyanki citadel of Gatchorof&mdashlocated beneath the Snowflake Mountains to the south.
As of the , Karokraths agents were in the midst of a plan to spark open hostilities between the mind flayers of Oryndoll and the githyanki of Gatchorof, with the ultimate expectation being that the githzerai could then capitalize on the conflict.
The githzerai stationed at Karokrath were part of a larger effort to keep watch on the mind flayers who inhabited Old Shanatar. The outpost was led by githzerai elders.
