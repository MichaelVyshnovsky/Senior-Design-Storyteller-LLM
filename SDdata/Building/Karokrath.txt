'''Karokrath''' was a large [[githzerai]] outpost on [[Toril]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The stronghold's location was a secret, but it was located somewhere within the badlands of [[Xian]] in [[Faerûn]].

==Activities==
From Karokrath, the githzerai deployed scouts and spies to monitor both the [[mind flayer]] city of [[Oryndoll]]&mdash;located in the [[Underdark]] beneath the outpost&mdash;and the [[githyanki]] citadel of [[Gatchorof]]&mdash;located beneath the [[Snowflake Mountains]] to the south.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Karokrath's agents were in the midst of a plan to spark open hostilities between the mind flayers of Oryndoll and the githyanki of Gatchorof, with the ultimate expectation being that the githzerai could then capitalize on the conflict.

==Inhabitants==
The githzerai stationed at Karokrath were part of a larger effort to keep watch on the mind flayers who inhabited [[Old Shanatar]]. The outpost was led by githzerai elders.
