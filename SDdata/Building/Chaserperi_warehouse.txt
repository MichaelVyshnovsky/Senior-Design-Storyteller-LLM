Chaserperi Warehouse was a warehouse in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep that was owned by the Chaserperi family, beginning with Auldo Chaserperi.
Rumors claimed that at some point Auldo Chaserperi discovered a lich in the cellars of a house he had purchased in the North Ward. Audlo was said to have struck a bargain with the lich, offering it materials and dead bodies in return for helping to defend his warehouse.
