The '''Chapel of Resounding Justice''' was a small fortified temple dedicated to [[Tyr]] located near [[Archenbridge]].

==Defenses==
The temple was protected by heavy reinforced doors. Rooftop vantages {{SI|20|feet}} from the ground allowed the inhabitants to defend against attackers, protected by chest-high parapets circling the outside walls.

A well-stocked armory contained enough [[chainmail]] suits, [[shield]]s and [[weapon]]s to arm a dozen combatants. The chapel was usually manned by four soldiers and their captain, as well as a [[cleric]].

==History==
''Circa'' {{YearlinkName|1295}}, [[Tyr]] sent the young planetar named [[Resounding Justice]] against [[Krysus Vaant]], a [[blackguard]] of [[Gargauth]]. The angel tracked her target outside of Archenbridge, and chased it southeast over several days. The ensuing battle pitted the antipaladin and a [[pit fiend]] against the angel, which paid the ultimate price in order to destroy its opponents: she sacrificed herself to blast her enemies with [[radiant energy]], but transformed into a statue of white and gold marble in the process.

After finding her remains a couple days later, members of the [[church of Tyr]] built a [[temple]] around the statue, to celebrate and praise her selfless act in the name of justice.

===Magical effects===
The statue in the middle of the courtyard radiated a gentle [[divine magic]], and at night glowed with a peaceful blue-white light. The temple reinforced the connection of the faithful with [[good domain]] spells, an effect especially strong for [[cleric]]s of the faith.

The divine magic protecting the place also helped stabilizing people on death's door, and creatures resting there would find their wounds healing faster than usual.

==Rumors & Legends==
Those touching the statue could still feel the divine presence of [[Resounding Justice]].  Some believed she was still inside, waiting for the right time to serve her deity again. This was the subject of much debates within the clergy: some believed that they should find a way to restore her to life, while traditionalists argued this would undermine the meaning of her sacrifice, and potentially undo the magic that destroyed her foes.
