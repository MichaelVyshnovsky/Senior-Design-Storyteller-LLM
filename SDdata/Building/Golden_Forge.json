Only Gebs most faithful followers knew the location of this temple.\nGebs clergy within the Golden Forge spent the vast majority of their time attempting to stop the volcano from erupting, as it threatened to do since the Time of Troubles. Unbeknownst to the outside world, Gebs clergy saved the coasts of Unther from being buried by ash had the volcano erupted."
