Knights of the North
Castle Vathar was a massive fortress located among the hills east of the Dragonspine Mountains. 
It was an ancient edifice that had been continuously improved upon with upgrades and enhancements for centuries.
The castle lay between hills to the east and the Dragonspine Mountains to the west, alongside a river that connected the Glumpen Swamp with Lake Longreach.
Castle Vathar was the meeting point of the Toraths March trail that led south to the shores of the Moonsea, the Ilinvur Trail that ran northwards to Ilinvur, and the Verdigris Trail that went west to the community of Verdigris.

They were accompanied on their journey by Ector Brahms, an officer of the Knights of the Black Fist. Upon their arrival they discovered that the folk of the region were fleeing their homes by caravan, seeking shelter within the castles walls.
The castle was the base for several famous military garrisons, and also was used as a base by the Knights of the North adventuring company, who were active in the mid–14 century DR.
As of the late 15 century, the castle housed a host of soldiers from the city-state of Phlan.
