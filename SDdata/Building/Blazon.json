        "mainbody": "he Blazon was a small, wood-framed, tavern and inn located within the village of Deadsnows during the 14 century DR. It was considered one of the best taverns in the bar, thanks to the efforts of its proprietor, a shrewd businessman named Lonnor.\nA wooden sign adorned the front of the tavern, emblazoned with a painting of a large shield with simple heraldry. It featured a green field, with a broad white band across its center. Despite its common appearance, the origins of its meaning were unknown to Lonnor since he bought the Blazon.\nBefore the gold rush, the Blazon primarily catered to local lumberers, merchants, or herders from the upland pastures. After the influx of travelers into Deadsnows, the regulars came in for some refuge from the constant hustle and bustle of new travelers looking to strike it rich. They were less-than-cordial to strangers, but mainly kept to themselves.\nThe Blazon had three rooms for rent, each of which could accommodate six people in relative comfort. Following Deadsnows boom in population after the regions gold rush in 1372 DR, Lonnor raised the price of a room to 5 gp a night.\nThe kitchen offered visitors a plate of roast meat, either beef or mutton, with a side of boiled potatoes and vegetables for 5 sp a plate."
