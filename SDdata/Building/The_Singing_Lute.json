        "mainbody": "The Singing Lute was a tavern and an eatery located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, run by the half-orc bartenders and proprietors Tender Henk and Tender Honk circa 1492 DR.\nThe Singing Lute stood on the waterfront in The Steeps, offering a scenic view of the Gray Harbor and the Counting House to the east, rising above the water and Flymm Cargo warehouse to the west.\nThe tavern was a small building of three floors. The main entrance was located on the second floor, with the first floor taken by the kitchens and the third – by a dining balcony. The main and the first floors had terraces open to customers with seating and tables. The taproom propped was a small bar and several seating spaces with a dumbwaiter connected to the kitchen.\nDuring the day, the Singing Lute offered drinks and opened its kitchens in the evening for dining. Some of the foods prepared included Baldurian seafood stew, grilled rothé ribs, pumpkin stew, and gruel. As the drinks selection went, The Singing Lute offered local brews, beer, wine, tea, and water. However, ordering things off the menu did not guarantee the customers actually got what they ordered due to Tender Henks \"charming\" service and personality. In cases where Henk could not provide the service, Tender Honk would fill in for him.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Hlath patriar family owned the Singing Lute, with Tenders Henk and Honk running the establishment."
