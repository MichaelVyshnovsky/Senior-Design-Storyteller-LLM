        "Services": "During the day, the Singing Lute offered drinks and opened its kitchens in the evening for dining. Some of the foods prepared included [[Baldurian seafood stew]], [[grilled rothé ribs]], [[pumpkin stew]], and [[gruel]]. As the drinks selection went, The Singing Lute offered local brews, [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]], and water. However, ordering things off the menu did not guarantee the customers actually got what they ordered due to Tender Henk's \"charming\" service and personality. In cases where Henk could not provide the service, Tender Honk would fill in for him.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[Hlath (family)|Hlath]] [[patriar]] family owned the Singing Lute, with Tenders Henk and Honk running the establishment."
