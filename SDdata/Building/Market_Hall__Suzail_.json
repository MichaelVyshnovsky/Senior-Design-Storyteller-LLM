        "mainbody": "The Market Hall was a galleria marketplace in the capital city of Suzail in Cormyr.\nThe Market Hall stood at the southern end of the Coachwheels Way with the street forming a loop around the building. Directly north of the Market Hall were Six Coffers Trading Coster yards.\nVisitors to Suzail were warned not to confuse the Market Hall to the east that dealt in produce with the western open-air market where merchants peddled clothing, tools, and other similar items.\nThe Market Hall was also known for its notice board, which often contained notices for the busy citys available lodgings.\nThe Market Hall was the destination for greengrocers and farmers from outside of Suzail who brought their goods to be sold in the city. Fresh produce was carted to the Hall at the brink of dawn and purchased by locals and servants of wealthy households.\nApart from merchants, crafters, and other businesses within the Market Hall, stood a stone chair used to shame and punish miscreant shopkeepers. The guilds of Suzail did not tolerate unfair and low-quality merchant goods. The guilds-sponsored inspectors ensured the citys marketplaces ran reputable businesses. This scrutiny applied to traveling merchants from outside Suzail. Those caught swindling customers were chained to the stone chair in the Market Hall for an entire day with the defective goods on display for all to see. Rotten produced, and counterfeit alcohol was smeared all over the chain culprits."
