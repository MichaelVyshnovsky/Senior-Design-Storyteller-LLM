The High Holy Crafthouse of Inspiration was a monastery dedicated to Gond the Wonderbringer in the city of Illul in Lantan in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was the heart of Gonds church in the Realms.
It was a large walled monastery.
Circa 1370 DR, this monastery was run by High Artificer Danactar, Most Holy Servant of Gond. As the highest-ranking mortal cleric of Gond, Danactar was the supreme voice in ecclesiastical matters, at least on Lantan and among the Lantanese, and he was also leading councillor in Lantans ruling body, the Ayrorch.
The techsmiths of the church of Gond were based and trained at the High Holy Crafthouse.
