The '''Velti'Enorethal''' was a school of elven culture in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Velti'Enorethal provided education in elven traditions, history, philosophy, religion, and [[magic]]. This came with years of study and practice, and so inevitably taught patience as well. In particular, it was dedicated to the path of [[Labelas Enoreth]] and was a center of his faith, but it was not a true temple.

It catered to the children of the elven houses of Loudwater and to friends of the elven nobles. The staff included sages, priests, and [[wizard]]s.

==History==
As recorded in their own histories, two elven houses established the Velti'Enorethal and settled on the site, giving rise to the city of Loudwater.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, a student of the Velti'Enorethal, Galaer Grasswave, became the Green Regent. This attracted many elves to the Velti'Enorethal during his tenure.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}

The Velti'Enorethal was still in operation by [[1372 DR]]. At the time, the sages, priests, and mages were still trying to ascertain which parts of Glaer's nearly completed ritual to repair the city's magical wards had actually been completed after the [[Night of the Blood Moon]] in [[1369 DR]].

==Notable Students==
* [[Galaer Grasswave]], the [[Green Regent]] of 1368/1369 DR.
