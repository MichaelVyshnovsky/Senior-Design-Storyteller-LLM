        "Location": "It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the northern side of the road known as the Rise, between [[Belvyn's House of Good Cheer]] and [[Ruldarr's Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture]].<ref><ref>",
        "Services": "Small and jam-packed, the shop sold all sorts of things, including dry goods and an assortment of practical supplies, like [[candle]]s, [[rope]], and outerwear clothing. Prices were slightly above the average market price and Shondrin occasionally accepted items in trade, which he sold in the store. Hence, it included some secondhand items such as hardware and old armor and weaponry. If Shondrin didn't have what a customer wanted in stock, he could tell them the nearest place they could find it.\n\nWhile Shondrin rarely dealt in [[enchanted item]]s, they did turn up from time to time, apparently misidentified. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] once discovered a ''[[bag of holding]]'' shaped to resemble a statuette of a fat [[dragon]], the head of which swung back to reveal the opening; it was later sold. There were also tales of travelers purchasing a seemingly mundane old [[sword]], only to find it enchanted and possessing unexpected powers."
