The Broken Crown Inn was an inn found on the High Road north of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
The inn was situated just off the High Road and not far inland from Raven Cliff Beach and the ruins of Cragmire Keep and Angelhead Mine.

The Broken Crown Inn was rather modest in size it was two stories tall and did not boast many rooms, though parts of it were incomplete and under construction. The building was timber framed, with stone-brick walls on the ground floor and plastered walls on the upper floor, while the roof had wooden shingles. The ground floor was given over to a taproom, while the upper floor had a few rooms for guests.
In front of the inn was a well and behind it was a water wheel that emptied into a nearby pond, though the source of the water and its purpose and function are unknown.
In addition to room and board, the inn was a decent enough place to find work. Bounty officers could be found staying at the inn, offering recompense for those who helped rid the area of bandits and other criminals.

Its first owner was a sympathizer of Luskan who believed the rulers of Neverwintan should be overthrown, hence the name "Broken Crown".
Some time in the 1470s DR, the inn was purchased and re-opened by Gorun Pricebreaker, a dwarf merchant who sought to profit from the re-emerging trade traffic that had sprung up along the High Road.
Circa the , the inn became a hub of activity for adventurers, Harpers, and others who were taking actions against the Blackdagger Bandits that had taken over the ruins of Cragmire Keep and preyed on caravans on the High Road.
