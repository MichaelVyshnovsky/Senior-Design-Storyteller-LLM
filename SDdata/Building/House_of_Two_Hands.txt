The House of Two Hands was a monastery in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep, belonging to the Order of the Even-Handed.
This building was located on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep, overlooking Smugglers Bay.
This monastery stood three stories tall.
For much of its existence this building was a villa. Then in the late 14 century DR it was purchased by the Order of the Even-Handed with the help of some financial backing from Piergeiron the Paladinson.
