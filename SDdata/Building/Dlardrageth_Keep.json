        "mainbody": "'''Dlardrageth Keep''' was the abode of [[House Dlardrageth]] until roughly {{yearlink|-3000}}.",
        "Location": "The keep was sited in the area that would later become [[Dlabbradath]] in then-[[Cormanthor]].",
        "Structure": "The ruined keep had five floors, three of which were accessible, and three underground levels, one of which remained accessible as of {{yearlink|641}}.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor}}",
        "Interior": "There was at least one library at the heart of the building. The rooms around it were dominated by rubble.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|174|9}}",
        "Activities": "After it became haunted, the [[Srinshee]] used it sometimes to try out spells with her students.",
        "Defenses": "There were a number of [[ghost]]s still in the keep. [[Elven high magic]] kept them anchored there, so that they could never reach [[Arvandor]] or anywhere.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|177|9}}",
        "History": "The keep was uninhabited for millennia, starting roughly in {{yearlink|-3000}}, when its inhabitants were imprisoned under the orders of [[Coronal]] [[Miirphys Irithyl]] with elven high magic after being found to be breeding with [[fiend]]s to increase their power. Once trapped, they destroyed themselves, with most of the damage being caused by a spell battle between the Speaker and the Archmage of the house.\n\nPer the Srinshee, the tower was finally looted sometime around {{yearlink|-750}}. She took Elminster there to trade spells in {{yearlink|241}}{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|148-149|7}} and soon found herself challenged to a spell duel by [[Ilimitar]] in the central room of the keep.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|241}}, thirteen \"ardavanshee\" (rambunctious, delinquent youth) heirs of numerous houses chased [[Elminster]] into the ruins and attempted to slay him, believing him to be responsible for a deadly explosion during a party earlier in the night. Elminster slew eight of them, with five surviving, one of them severely injured in their wits.\n\nThe eight slain likely included the heirs of several houses, including the heirs to [[Tassarion]], [[Bellas]], [[Yeschant]], [[Ortaure]], and [[Maendellyn]] as well as the heir [[Leayonadas]], likely of [[Ortaure]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|259-262|13}} The survivors included [[Rotheloe Tyrneladhelu]], whose wits were severely damaged, while [[Selgauth Cathdeiryn]] and three others managed to overcome Elminster unscathed.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|237-238|12}} [[Tlannatar Wrathtree]] and [[Ivran Selorn]] were almost certainly among the slain.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|232-233|12}}",
