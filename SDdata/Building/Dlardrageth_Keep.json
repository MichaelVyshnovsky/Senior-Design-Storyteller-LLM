        "mainbody": "Dlardrageth Keep was the abode of House Dlardrageth until roughly .\nThe keep was sited in the area that would later become Dlabbradath in then-Cormanthor.\nThe ruined keep had five floors, three of which were accessible, and three underground levels, one of which remained accessible as of .\nThere was at least one library at the heart of the building. The rooms around it were dominated by rubble.\nAfter it became haunted, the Srinshee used it sometimes to try out spells with her students.\nThere were a number of ghosts still in the keep. Elven high magic kept them anchored there, so that they could never reach Arvandor or anywhere.\nThe keep was uninhabited for millennia, starting roughly in , when its inhabitants were imprisoned under the orders of Coronal Miirphys Irithyl with elven high magic after being found to be breeding with fiends to increase their power. Once trapped, they destroyed themselves, with most of the damage being caused by a spell battle between the Speaker and the Archmage of the house.\nPer the Srinshee, the tower was finally looted sometime around . She took Elminster there to trade spells in  and soon found herself challenged to a spell duel by Ilimitar in the central room of the keep.\nIn the , thirteen \"ardavanshee\" (rambunctious, delinquent youth) heirs of numerous houses chased Elminster into the ruins and attempted to slay him, believing him to be responsible for a deadly explosion during a party earlier in the night. Elminster slew eight of them, with five surviving, one of them severely injured in their wits.\nThe eight slain likely included the heirs of several houses, including the heirs to Tassarion, Bellas, Yeschant, Ortaure, and Maendellyn as well as the heir Leayonadas, likely of Ortaure. The survivors included Rotheloe Tyrneladhelu, whose wits were severely damaged, while Selgauth Cathdeiryn and three others managed to overcome Elminster unscathed. Tlannatar Wrathtree and Ivran Selorn were almost certainly among the slain.\nThe ghosts of the Dlardrageth were assumed to be nigh-invincible."
