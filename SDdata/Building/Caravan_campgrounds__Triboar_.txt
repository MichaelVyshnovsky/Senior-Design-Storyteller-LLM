The '''north caravan campground''' and '''west caravan campground''' were a pair of fenced-in fields in the town of [[Triboar]] where visiting caravans could park their [[wagon]]s and [[oxen]] as well as pitch camps for free.

==Location==
Both campgrounds were located in the center of Triboar just off the market square. The north campground abutted the square to the north along the [[High Road]] adjacent to [[Ransor's Open Road]], while the west campground was to the west along the [[Triboar Trail]] adjacent to the [[Happy Horse Ranch]] and the [[Triboar Travelers]] caravan company. The caretaker for the campgrounds was located in the east corner of the north campground.

==Services==
The spaces were provided for free by the Lord Protector of Triboar, who paid a caretaker to keep the grounds clear of garbage and excrement. Each campground had a {{SIAdj|30|foot|long=yes|adj=deep}} stone well for fresh water, located in the southeast corner of the north campground and in the center of the west campground.

==History==
The campgrounds were a dominant feature of the center of Triboar by the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the campgrounds were maintained by the elderly [[Darz Helgar]].
