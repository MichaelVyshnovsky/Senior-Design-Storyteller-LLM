'''Lamantha's mortuary''' was a business owned by the [[necromancer]] [[Lamantha]] that provided mortician and taxidermy services to the [[undead]] inhabitants of [[Evernight]] in the [[Shadowfell]].

==Location==
It was located north of the river of lava that flowed through Evernight.

==Services==
As a mortician and taxidermist, much of Lamantha's work involved preparing bodies (or parts of bodies) as decorations, sporting equipment, tools, or trophies for her undead clientele. She was also involved in preparing living [[humanoid]]s to be killed and eaten by the undead of Evernight in ritualistic "[[Funeral (Evernight)|funerals]]" held in the [[Graveyard (Evernight)|Graveyard]]. This included sedating the victim with a powerful paralytic (derived from the humors of [[ghoul]]s), then cleaning the victim, dressing them in fine clothes, and delivering them to the [[Temple of Filth]].

Lamantha also provided "healing" to injured undead as well as cosmetic services to make them appear to be alive.

==History==
Owing to the fact that Evernight's undead did not harass Lamantha in recognition of her services, her mortuary was one of the only places in Evernight where living people might find shelter as of {{Yearlink|1479}} (assuming Lamantha could tolerate them).
