'''Garmuth's Golden Gauntlet''' was an inn and festhall located in the town of [[Tulmon]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The establishment derived its name from the large gauntleted hand that stood in the center of the main lobby.

==Activities==
The festhall was frequented mostly by Tulmon's working class, so brawls often broke out during the various dances. Patrons could use private suites to enjoy a more peaceful evening. Order and security was maintained by a staff of ex-[[adventurer]]s.
