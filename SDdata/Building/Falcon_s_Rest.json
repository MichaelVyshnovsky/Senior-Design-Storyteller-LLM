        "mainbody": "The '''Falcon's Rest''', or simply '''the Falcon''', was a popular [[inn]] found within [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid- to late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Locals often directed rich visitors to this inn, and many believed the Falcon's Rest to represent what the even-more-expensive [[Pride of Arabel]] should have been.",
        "Description": "Quiet and cozy, the Falcon's Rest exhibited luxury around every corner. The ambiance of the inn was maintained in part because of strategically placed ''shielding'' spells to help quell the noise.\n\nThe lobby of the Falcon's Rest housed a large pedestal topped with a stone ball upon which an expertly stuffed [[falcon]] perched. It also contained a coat rack constructed from the tail of [[manticore]] supported by two mounted [[ankheg]] heads. Other stuffed exotic animals and monsters&mdash;including a [[griffon]] and even a [[couatl]]&mdash;were found throughout the building being held aloft by magic. Many people treated the inn as a museum and came simply to admire and explore the bizarre menagerie of creatures.\n\nThe second floor contained a hallway with a taxidermied, headless [[chimera]], with fancy [[brass]] [[lamp]]s where its heads should have been.",
        "Location": "The inn sat in the most prosperous section of the city, the north,{{Arabel map orientation}} where most of the wealthy nobles' estates were&mdash;such as House [[Nyaril]], which was adjacent to the inn to the east. It was also located on a corner opposite the block containing a grove and temple to [[Sune]].",
        "Services": "The staff was known for their service speed and impeccable discretion in serving their customers. Travelers who visited the inn on a cold day could even be expected to receive a warm cloak, a hot [[mug]] of broth, and a steaming foot bath, all without even asking for them. The staff was also very cordial with repeat guests, including remembering their names and personal preferences for service.\n\nSpecial \"call gongs\" were placed throughout the building. Striking one typically brought a servant running within just three short breaths. If guests requested it, servants would bathe them, or else one could take a bath in privacy.",
        "Staff": "The Falcon's Rest was owned by a friendly [[sage]] named [[Elmdaerle]], Elmdaerle was rarely present at the inn, however."
