        "mainbody": "The '''Broken Crown Inn''' was an inn found on the [[High Road]] north of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=\"D&D.N>",
        "Location": "The inn was situated just off the High Road and not far inland from [[Raven Cliff Beach]] and the ruins of [[Cragmire Keep]] and [[Angelhead Mine]].<ref name=\"D&D.N />",
        "Structure": "[[File:Broken Crown Inn rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The water wheel behind the Broken Crown. No, we can't explain it either.'']]\nThe Broken Crown Inn was rather modest in size: it was two stories tall and did not boast many rooms, though parts of it were incomplete and under construction. The building was timber framed, with stone-brick walls on the ground floor and plastered walls on the upper floor, while the roof had wooden shingles. The ground floor was given over to a taproom, while the upper floor had a few rooms for guests.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n\nIn front of the inn was a well and behind it was a water wheel that emptied into a nearby pond, though the source of the water and its purpose and function are unknown.<ref name=\"D&D.N />",
        "Services": "In addition to room and board, the inn was a decent enough place to find work. Bounty officers could be found staying at the inn, offering recompense for those who helped rid the area of [[bandit]]s and other criminals.<ref name=\"D&D.N />",
        "History": "[[File:Broken Crown Sign.jpg|thumb|right|''The sign of the Broken Crown, itself broken.'']]\nIts first owner was a sympathizer of [[Luskan]] who believed the rulers of [[Neverwintan]] should be overthrown, hence the name \"Broken Crown\".<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n\nSome time in the 1470s [[DR]], the inn was purchased and re-opened by Gorun Pricebreaker, a [[dwarf]] merchant who sought to profit from the re-emerging trade traffic that had sprung up along the High Road.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n\n''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the inn became a hub of activity for [[adventurer]]s, [[Harpers]], and others who were taking actions against the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] that had taken over the ruins of [[Cragmire Keep]] and preyed on caravans on the High Road.<ref name=\"D&D.N />",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "[[File:Gorun Pricebreaker.png|thumb|right|250px|''Gorun guarantees broken prices at the Broken Crown.'']]\n* [[Gorun Pricebreaker]], innkeeper and merchant.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* [[Cecil Proudfoot]], a [[halfling]] who sought to improve the lives of his kin.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* [[Melkhor Goldseeker]], a dwarven merchant.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* [[Taggot Ironshroud]], a dwarven adventurer and relic hunter.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* [[Seven Toes]] and [[Lanric]], Harper agents acting to ruin the Blackdaggers.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* Spycatcher [[Westband]], a [[Neverwinter Guard]]sman sent to apprehend Blackdagger spies.<ref name=\"D&D.N />\n* An [[unnamed drow operative]] working against the Blackdaggers<ref name=\"D&D.N />"
