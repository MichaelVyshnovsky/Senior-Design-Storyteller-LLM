        "mainbody": "QM III was a magical and quasimagical item shop that operated in the enclave of Eileanar until its destruction in .\nQM III was found in the upper tiers of Karsus, almost at the center of the entire structure.\nThe QM business was owned by the arcanist Parzal the Outrageous. The store offered the most complete catalogue of magical items in all of Netheril, and had a total of seven locations spread between the enclaves.\nThe business came about when Parzal made a deal with Mortimar to jointly create a shop that would sell Parzals autobiographical book, Parzals Perils, as well as other magical goods such as material components. The success of the book meant that a total of seven stores were opened, with QM III in Karsus being the third. Parzal withdrew from operations while he wrote books, and Mortimar was left in charge.\nThis state of affairs was ended when Mortimar tricked Parzal into committing a high crime against a Karsite official, leading to Parzal faking his death and Mortimar gaining complete legal ownership of the company. Parzal eventually gained revenge via a cursed spell scroll, and the stricken Mortimar took the blame for Parzals crime and allowed himself to be executed. Parzal then revealed himself as alive and accepted a 60-day imprisonment for faking his death, and the business was temporarily taken over by his close friend Archmeagan until he returned. After his release from prison Parzal went on a lengthy vacation outside of Netheril, resulting in him surviving the events of Karsuss Folly by sheer chance."
