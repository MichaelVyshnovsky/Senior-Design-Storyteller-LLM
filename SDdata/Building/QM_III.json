        "Location": "QM III was found in the upper tiers of Karsus, almost at the center of the entire structure.",
        "Services": "The QM business was owned by the [[arcanist]] [[Parzal|Parzal the Outrageous]]. The store offered the most complete catalogue of magical items in all of [[Netheril]], and had a total of seven locations spread between the enclaves.",
        "History": "The business came about when Parzal made a deal with [[Mortimar]] to jointly create a shop that would sell Parzal's autobiographical book, ''[[Parzal's Perils]]'', as well as other magical goods such as [[material component]]s. The success of the book meant that a total of seven stores were opened, with QM III in Karsus being the third. Parzal withdrew from operations while he wrote books, and Mortimar was left in charge.\n\nThis state of affairs was ended when Mortimar tricked Parzal into committing a high crime against a Karsite official, leading to Parzal faking his death and Mortimar gaining complete legal ownership of the company. Parzal eventually gained revenge via a ''[[curse]]d'' [[spell scroll]], and the stricken Mortimar took the blame for Parzal's crime and allowed himself to be executed. Parzal then revealed himself as alive and accepted a 60-day imprisonment for faking his death, and the business was temporarily taken over by his close friend [[Archmeagan]] until he returned. After his release from prison Parzal went on a lengthy vacation outside of Netheril, resulting in him surviving the events of [[Karsus's Folly]] by sheer chance."
