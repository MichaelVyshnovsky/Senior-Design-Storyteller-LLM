The Triglio was a general store in the town of Targos in Icewind Dale in the late 15 century DR. It was run by Jestin Hunrae was named for a fishermens shanty, Triglio.
It lay near the center of town.
In the 1480s DR, the store sold foodstuffs, fishing rods, candles, lamp oil, sackcloth, snowshoes, wagon wheels, and everything in between. Despite Targos being a fishing town, it did not sell supplies and equipment for fishing and sailing, which were provided by specialty craftsmen and traders. For anything Triglio didnt have, Jestin could suggest another store.
