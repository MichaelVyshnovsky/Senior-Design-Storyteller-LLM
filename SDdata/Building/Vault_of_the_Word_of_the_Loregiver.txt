The '''Vault of the Word of the Loregiver''' was part of the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
Contained within this vault was the oldest known recorded copy of the [[Word of the Loregiver]], created by the first [[Grand Caliph]]. These precious scrolls were displayed for all to see, but kept safely behind ''[[wall of force|walls of force]]''.

==Defenses==
In addition to the ''walls of force'' protecting the vault, many magical protective measures were used to guard the ancient scrolls.

A [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[slayer genie]] lay hidden within the base of the stand holding the scrolls, ready to spring out and destroy any intruder or thief with unbridled fury.
