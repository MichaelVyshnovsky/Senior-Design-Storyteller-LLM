It also served as a living quarters for the occupying forces, as they oversaw the lumber efforts within the nearby slave camp.",

She kept a small cache of treasure, along with vials of her [[poison]]-of-choice along with a ''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]'' hidden within the temple's altar.\n\nThe temple was corrupted with evil [[magic]] that had a maximizing [[metamagic]] effect upon any [[spell]]s cast by worshipers of [[Bane]]."
