Point Dusk was the westernnmost fortress in the chain of the Citadel of the Raven complex and thus the closest part of the Citadel to the setting sun.
The fortress held two hundred defenders. Soldiers were usually stationed here as a form of punishment for an indiscretion.
The soldiers at Point Dusk whispered that the ghost of Galauntar Hawkhelm haunted the fortress.
