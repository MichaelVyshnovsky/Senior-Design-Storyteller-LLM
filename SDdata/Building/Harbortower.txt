The '''Harbortower''' was a watchtower in [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
The Harbortower lay in Marsember's northwestern corner, along the wall.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/07-18 - Marsember, Part 3}}

==Structure==
From the heights of the tower, a lookout could look out onto the sea or, from out the windows, they could look down towards the street. According to high-level [[War Wizards]], the place was too rickety and unstable for mighty spellcastings.

==Interior==
As of {{yearlink|1373}}, there were several rooms. One of the rooms had a table and a cot.

===Atmosphere===
The inside of the tower was always cold and drafty, even in the muggiest summers.

==Defenses==
There were [[farglasses]] on the window, allowing watchmen to search the horizon for pirates.

==History==
The War Wizard [[Huldyl Rauthur]] had been posted on the Harbortower for a few years by {{yearlink|1373}}. He was not allowed to have dalliances or cast dangerous spells while on lookout duty. Despite this, he had his meetings with [[Harnrim Starangh]], a [[Red Wizard]], at that location.
