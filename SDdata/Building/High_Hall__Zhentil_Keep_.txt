The '''High Hall''', which was also called the '''High Hall of the Lords' Council''', was the meeting place for the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] who were the ruling government in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The High Hall was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] on [[Gold Street]] and [[the Dark Road]].

==Description==
A series of connected buildings formed the structure of the High Hall.

==Activities==
The Lords of Zhentil Keep met here to discuss issues critical to the city, and many minor bureaucrats worked here on more mundane tasks to ensure the smooth operation of daily activities.

==Defenses==
In addition to a squad of at least 36 [[Zhentilar]] soldiers, a pair of [[stone giant]] bailiffs guarded the Hall at all times. Security was doubled any time the Lords conducted a meeting.
