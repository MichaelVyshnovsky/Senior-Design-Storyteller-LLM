        "mainbody": "'''The Grove''' was the name of the center of the [[Eldathyn]] faith in the [[Vilhon Reach]], located in the [[druid]] stronghold city [[Cedarsproke]].",
        "Description": "The temple was a large open-air structure that was more akin to a shrine. The Grove had no wall and its glass roof was propped up by columns. The furthest part of the temple, on the opposite side from the main entrance stood a bubbling pool of water, maintained by the High Priestess.",
        "Activities": "The Grove was one of very few major places of organized worship dedicated to Eldathyn with the only other large temple located in the city of [[Surkh]]. The Grove attracted pilgrims who traveled the [[Gulthmere Forest]] and into Cedarsproke.\n\nVisitors and pilgrims of the Grove were encouraged to dispose of their weapons in the temple's bubbling pool of water. In exchange for lost arms, visitors received wooden ''[[holy symbol]]'' of Eldath.",
        "History": "The High Priestess of Eldath in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] was [[Shemratha Callingowl]], a quiet woman who led the church from The Grove."
