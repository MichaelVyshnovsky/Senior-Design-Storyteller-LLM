The '''Cairn Wheel''' was an ancient [[druid]]ic stone circle and a place of worship of [[Silvanus]], the Oak-Father.

==Location==
The Cairn Wheel stood in the north-central part of the [[Forest of Tethir]], close to the forest's northern edge, to the southeast of the town of [[Brost]].

==History==
Some hundred years before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a druid named [[Sklaerth Tholone]] was murdered by a band of bandits at the center of the Cairn Wheel. With his dying breath, the druid evoked ''[[Thorncall]]''. The magic swiftly erected an impenetrable thorn barrier around the circle in a {{SIAdj|100|yard|long=yes}} radius. As of the late 14{{th}} century, the skeletal remains of Sklaerth's and his four murderers still laid at the center of the circle. Stories said that the bandits were rich and perished with their wealth beside them, and Sklaerth Tholone possessed [[magic item]]s sacred to Silvanus. But none risked removing the treasures from the Cairn Wheel in fear of the Oak-Father's wrath.
