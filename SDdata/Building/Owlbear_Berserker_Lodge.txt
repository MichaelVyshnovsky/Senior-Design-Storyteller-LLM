The '''Owlbear Berserker Lodge''' was the base of operations for the [[Owlbear lodge|Owlbear Berserkers]] found in the capital city of [[Immilmar]] in [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Location==
The lodge was located on the north side of the city.

==Description==
The interior of the longhouse was decorated with the skulls of slain monsters, ancient [[shield]]s, and [[totem]] carvings.

==Activities==
Non-[[Rashemaar berserkers|berserkers]] usually avoided going anywhere near the lodge since the berserkers enjoyed picking fights. However, any outsider who proved themselves during such a fight were often invited to feast and revel with the berserkers within the lodge.
