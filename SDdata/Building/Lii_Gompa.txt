Lii Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot. It was nicknamed the Left Hand of UChan.
It stood in central Tabot, at the southern edge of the Po Yul Dzayul Range. Its position north of the capital UChan Gompa gave it its title it stood opposite Pokarr Gompa, the Right Hand of UChan.
Lii Gompa was the primary rival to neighboring Pokarr Gompa. This might be why Pang, a monk of Pokarr, spoke little of it to Mei Lung when the Dragon visited Tabot circa .
It housed over a thousand lamas and novices.
Lii Gompa was known for its two large annual festivals and its many bells. A legend held that when a true oracle of Tabot died, every bell in Lii Gompa would spontaneously ring nine times to help their soul travel to the Celestial Heavens.
It was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Lii.
