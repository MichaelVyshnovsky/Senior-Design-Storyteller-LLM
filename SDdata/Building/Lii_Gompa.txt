'''Lii Gompa''' was a monastery (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]]. It was nicknamed the '''Left Hand of U'Chan'''.

==Geography==
It stood in central Tabot, at the southern edge of the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]]. Its position north of the capital [[U'Chan Gompa]] gave it its title; it stood opposite [[Pokarr Gompa]], the Right Hand of U'Chan.

==Relationships==
Lii Gompa was the primary rival to neighboring Pokarr Gompa. This might be why [[Pang]], a monk of Pokarr, spoke little of it to [[Mei Lung]] when the Dragon visited Tabot ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==Inhabitants==
It housed over a thousand lamas and novices.

==Description==
Lii Gompa was known for its two large annual festivals and its many [[bell]]s. A legend held that when a true oracle of Tabot died, every bell in Lii Gompa would spontaneously ring nine times to help their soul travel to the [[Celestial Heavens]].

==History==
It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Lii.
