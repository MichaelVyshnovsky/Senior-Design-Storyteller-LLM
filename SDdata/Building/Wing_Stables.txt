The '''Wing Stables''' was a collection of roosts established around a large central tree that provided housing for the myriad of flying steeds that came into or lived within the city of [[Myth Drannor]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|76}}

==Location==
It was located in the district of [[Sheshyrinnam]], on [[Gondrim's Ride]] near [[Draogneyes Street]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves/Map}}

==Structure==
The Wing Stables comprised a two-story ground structure and the numerous aeries that were established within its great [[shadowtop]] tree. The eight elevated nests and roosting areas were well-separated from one another, extending far above the streets of the city.

==Services==
Housing for a variety of mounts, both terrestrial and airborne were provided at the Wing Stables, including accommodations for [[unicorn]]s, [[moon-horse]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, and even [[pegasi]]. 

The uppermost aeries were reserved for the [[dragon]]s that served the commanders of [[Akh'Velahr]]'s [[Wing & Horn]] aerial cavalry.
