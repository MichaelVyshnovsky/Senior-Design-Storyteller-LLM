The Wing Stables was a collection of roosts established around a large central tree that provided housing for the myriad of flying steeds that came into or lived within the city of Myth Drannor.
It was located in the district of Sheshyrinnam, on Gondrims Ride near Draogneyes Street.
The Wing Stables comprised a two-story ground structure and the numerous aeries that were established within its great shadowtop tree. The eight elevated nests and roosting areas were well-separated from one another, extending far above the streets of the city.
Housing for a variety of mounts, both terrestrial and airborne were provided at the Wing Stables, including accommodations for unicorns, moon-horses, hippogriffs, and even pegasi. 
The uppermost aeries were reserved for the dragons that served the commanders of AkhVelahrs Wing & Horn aerial cavalry.
