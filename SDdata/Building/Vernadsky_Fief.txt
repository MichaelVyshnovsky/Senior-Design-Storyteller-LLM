The Vernadsky Fief was the walled estate of the Vernadsky noble family who inhabited the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
This walled compound was located almost directly in the center of Almorel along the Golden Way. Much of the estate bordered the promenade that led to Mechnik Nikitskys residence.
