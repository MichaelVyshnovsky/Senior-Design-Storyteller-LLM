The Elfhold was an ancient crypt hidden under the Wyvernstones of Hullack in the Hullack Forest, Cormyr.
It was once used as a burial vault by the elves of House Amaratharr, where their remains were interred in small crypts carved into the walls of the grotto. The legendary human druid Hullack of Eldath, whose name lived on in that of the forest, was also buried here. It was said that Hullack could manifest as a ghost to those who came peacefully to seek long lost lore.
