        "mainbody": "Madame Freonas Tea Kettle was an eatery and establishment in Phlan that catered to adventurers and other travelers during the late 15 century. It was named after and run by the enigmatic Madame Freona, and her five daughters.\nIt had the reputation of being a safe and relaxing place for those looking to avoid the otherwise chaotic streets of Phlan.\nIn addition to the food and drink offered, adventurers often used the Tea Kettle as a place to take on new jobs in town.\nSome time during the 1480s DR, the Harpers of Phlan were looking for a band of adventurers to recover an illegally-acquired red dragon egg and return it to the Tea Kettle for their safekeeping.\nAround that same time, an item of immense power was brought to Freonas Tea House. An agent of the Emerald Enclave named Buhrell Caah sought to take the item from its current owner, despite not knowing that it was in fact the tooth of a blue dragon.\nKnown patrons of Madame Feornas Tea Kettle included\n* Esma and Eve, two gossiping old ladies.\n* Minnitha, a dragonborn explorer and treasure-hunter.\n* Schuyler, a critic of the culinary arts.\n* Surruk, the wild elf protector of the Quivering Forest."
