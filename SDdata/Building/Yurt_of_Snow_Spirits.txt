A Yurt of Snow Spirits was a unique part of a typical Tuigan Khans camp.
This yurt was surrounded by a wicked fence decorated with iron charms. Charms also decorated the yurt itself which was blackened with charcoal. A small offering ground sat next to the yurt as well. A yurt of snow spirits always remained empty, designated as a place for the evil snow spirits so they would leave the rest of the camp alone.
These were sacred yurts dedicated to the snow spirits. Unlike all of the other yurts which always had their openings facing southeast, this yurts opening faced northwest.
