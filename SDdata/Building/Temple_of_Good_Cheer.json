        "mainbody": "century DR)\nThe Temple of Good Cheer was a makeshift temple dedicated to Lliira and Milil located in the Adventurers Quarter of the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe temple was located in a three-story building on the east side of Weeping Maidens Run near the corner of Fishwife Alley and Slop Street. It was on the second floor and was accessible through an external stairwell. The temple occupied the second floor of the building between the derelict lower and topmost floors.\nThe Temple spanned over the entire center floor of the building. It was separated into three distinct sections the west-most area was a large room dedicated to dance lessons the east-most room was used for teaching musical instruments, and the southeast room held the worshiping area. The remainder of the rooms interconnecting those sections were used as living suites by the resident clerics.\nThe makeshift temple sported large silver holy symbols mounted high on a wall covered in red velvet, visible from both inside and outside the building. While the floor housing the temple was kept clean, the others were decrepit and neglected. \nIn addition to religious ceremonies, the temple offered dance and music lessons in return for donations.\nThe resident priestess of Lliira was a skilled dancer and taught rare skills such as ancient elven court dances, Rashemite dances, and Tethyrian dances, in addition to more common dancing styles from all over the Realms. \nThe resident priest of Milil taught how to play the flute, birdpipes, and string instruments such as the lyre. He also gave singing lessons, focusing mostly on common and Elvish ballads. \nThe temple was built circa 1366 DR by a married couple of clerics retiring from adventuresâ€“Rachel Arren and Arkiem Arren. With the blessing of the Patriarch of Song, they decided to establish a communal temple to both their deities. The temples main source of income was the dance and music lessons provided there during the day, and the funds raised by Arkiem during nightly performances at the Safehaven Inn.\nThe temple was inhabited by the resident clerics. They saved money with the intention of purchasing the entire building, in order to fix it and establish a more proper temple."
