        "mainbody": "The Old Owl was a tavern in the town of Loudwater in the Savage Frontier, in operation in the 1360s DR. The proprietor was a retired warrior.\nIt was a quiet, family-oriented established also preferred by elders. Common activities were muted conversation, playing cards, and smoking. Indeed, revelers who were loud or boisterous were asked to go someplace else. Prices were low and while the liquor range was limited, the homebrew was especially good.\nThe inn was established by 1366 DR and still in operation through 1370 DR."
