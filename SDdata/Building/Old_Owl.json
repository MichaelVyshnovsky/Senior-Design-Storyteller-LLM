        "Description": "It was a quiet, family-oriented established also preferred by elders. Common activities were muted conversation, playing cards, and smoking. Indeed, revelers who were loud or boisterous were asked to go someplace else. Prices were low and while the liquor range was limited, the homebrew was especially good.",
        "History": "The inn was established by [[1366 DR]] and still in operation through [[1370 DR]]."
