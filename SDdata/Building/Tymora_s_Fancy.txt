Tymoras Fancy was a high coin gambling establishment in the North Ward of the city of Waterdeep.
The gambling den offered a fair and level field of play no spells, no magic items, no exceptions.
*Several card games
*Years Turning Wheel - guess the rune that would mark the end of the wheel to win
*Races - mice or tiny gem colored lizards raced on a miniature track
*Clockwork Castle - miniature foot high clockwork knights in full armor fought to the death
The public was told that all clandestine magical items were disintegrated, though this was a lie as all such items were teleported to a locked box in the back office.
Its proprietor was Elaith Craulnober. He employed his oldest friend and distant kin, Tincheron, as one of the guards. The hall also employed several clerics, wizards, and even an illithid to watch for cheaters. At least one of the clerics was a worshiper of Gond, who ensured the clockworks of the games were working properly and to make repairs as needed.
