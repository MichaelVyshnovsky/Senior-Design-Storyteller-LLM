'''Tymora's Fancy''' was a high coin gambling establishment in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Activities==
The gambling den offered a fair and level field of play: no [[spell]]s, no magic items, no exceptions.

===Games===
*Several card games
*Year's Turning Wheel - guess the rune that would mark the end of the wheel to win
*Races - mice or tiny [[gem]] colored lizards raced on a miniature track
*Clockwork Castle - miniature foot high clockwork knights in full armor fought 'to the death'

==Defenses==
The public was told that all clandestine magical items were [[disintegrate]]d, though this was a lie as all such items were [[teleport]]ed to a locked box in the back office.

==Inhabitants==
Its proprietor was [[Elaith Craulnober]]. He employed his oldest friend and distant kin, [[Tincheron]], as one of the guards. The hall also employed several [[cleric|clerics]], [[wizard|wizards]], and even an [[illithid]] to watch for cheaters. At least one of the clerics was a worshiper of [[Gond]], who ensured the clockworks of the games were working properly and to make repairs as needed.
