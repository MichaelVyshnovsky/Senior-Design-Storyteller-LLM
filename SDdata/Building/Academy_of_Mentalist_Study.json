        "mainbody": "The '''Academy of Mentalist Study''' was a famous magic school in [[Eileanar]] that operated for the entire lifetime of the enclave.",
        "Services": "The college focused on the magic of the [[mentalist]] field. Just before [[Karsus's Folly]], the Dean of Teachers, [[Zucchi]], taught alongside a body of teachers who each specialized in a particular area. They were made up of  [[Czarnieck]] (mind control), [[Flaugergues]] ([[illusion]]s), [[Lycanter]] ([[telepathy]]), [[Siculus]] (illusions), [[Addington]] ([[divination]]), [[Midoria]] (information gathering), [[Grenoble]] (divination), and [[Alexander (Netherese)|Alexander]] ([[necromancy]]).",
        "History": "The Academy was founded by [[Karsus]] as part of the grand opening of his enclave in {{yearlinkConvert|3185|NY}}, with the intention of drawing people in to populate his new city.\n\nThe most famous student was the [[arcanist]] [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]], who produced a revolutionary and outrageous piece of work that accurately detailed the mechanics of the [[planes]] and [[demiplane]]s. When it became known that he had studied at the Academy the student body increased by 30% for the next five years, and the college added another two levels to the main structure in addition to purchasing the neighboring block in order to build dormitories."
