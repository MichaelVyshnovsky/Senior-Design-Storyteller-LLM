The element of '''earth''' was one of the four fundamental building blocks of matter: solid, stable, and unyielding in character.<ref> It encompassed all kinds of stone and rock, but also soil, metal ores and sand.

==Cosmology==
Earth manifested its position in the cosmos as the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], one of the [[Inner Planes]].<ref> The element was also represented there in living form as [[earth elemental]]s.

The ruler over the [[portfolio]] of earth in [[Faerûn]] and [[Zakhara]] was the [[elemental lord]] [[Grumbar]], and [[Plutoq]] in the [[Maztican pantheon]].<ref> Among [[demihuman]] deities, [[Segojan Earthcaller]] of the [[gnome]]s,<ref> [[Urogalan]] of the [[halfling]]s,<ref> and [[Dumathoin]] of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] held dominion over earth,<ref> but [[Garl Glittergold]], [[Callarduran Smoothhands]],<ref> [[Laduguer]], and all other dwarven deities were concerned with the element, too.<ref> The evil [[archomental]] [[Ogrémoch]] also sought to rule the element of earth, but was secretly thwarted by the much more powerful Grumbar.<ref>{{Cite web/Villains: Cult of the Black Earth}}

==Magic==
===School of elemental earth===
Many [[magic]]al spells utilized the element of earth.<ref> Elemental earth was recognized as a "school of effect" (rather than one of the eight traditional [[schools of magic]]).<ref> Wizards specializing in this school were called earth [[elementalist]]s. Earth was opposed to the [[element of air]], both as a school of magic and as a worldview.<ref>

Magic-users in Zakhara had a similar but not identical notion of earth magic in the form of the [[Sand (province)|province of sand]].

Likewise, the [[wu jen]] of [[Kara-Tur]] divided spells into five elemental groups, including earth. In some traditions, earth was considered the same group as [[metal]], whereas, in other traditions, the two elemental groups were distinct.

===Divine earth magic===
A number of deities granted [[Divine magic|divine spells]] that relied on the element, either in the form of the [[elemental earth sphere]],<ref> or the [[earth domain]].<ref><ref>

==Celestial bodies==
[[Spelljammer|Spacefarers]] also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the [[crystal sphere]]s.<ref>|74-76}} Earth bodies often were the most common celestial objects, and commonly featured the largest population.

Major earth bodies in [[Realmspace]] were:<ref>
* [[Anadia]]
* [[Toril]]
* [[Glyth]]
* [[Garden]]
