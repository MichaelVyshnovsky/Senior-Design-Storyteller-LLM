The '''Man-o'-War''', also written as the '''Man O' War''', was a high-quality restaurant and inn on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} [[DR]]. It was considered by some to be among the best such establishments in all the [[crystal sphere]]s. Its owners were unknown, but were rumored to be [[adventurer]]s, and it was managed by [[Shrii Hallek]].

==Location==
The tavern stood in the [[Bral/High City|High City]] part of [[Bral]], on Grand Street and at the end of High Street. It stood between [[House Cartan]] and the [[Royal Theatrical Company]], and backed onto [[Lake Bral]].<ref>

==Description==
It had an amazing view over Lake Bral.

==Atmosphere==
The Man O' War had such a high reputation for elegance and safety that the rulers of Bral had visiting diplomats stay here when guestrooms in the [[Starhaven]] palace were fully occupied. Hallek was very respectful to guests.

There was a strict dress code in the dining room, and both [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] were proscribed for patrons.

==Defenses==
Security was provided by a force of elite mercenaries who were paid very well to guarantee guests' safety.

==Services==
A standard dinner cost as much as 8–12 [[gp]] per person, but the food was top quality and the best in Bral, while the service was exceptional.

Moreover, it had ten luxurious suites of rooms that could be rented for 10–30 gp per night. This included breakfast each morning and a bottle of fine [[wine]].
