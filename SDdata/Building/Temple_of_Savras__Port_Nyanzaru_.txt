The '''Temple of Savras''' in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], was a place of worship dedicated to [[Savras]], the [[god]] of [[diviner]]s, [[Fate domain|fate]], [[fortune teller]]s, and [[wizard]]s.

==Location==
The temple lay in Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] atop [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]], and was in fact the namesake of that hill.

==Structure==
The temple was a grand, domed building with a tiled roof designed to resemble an unblinking eye staring up into the sky.

==Services==
The people of Port Nyanzaru went to the temple to ask for a peek into the future to help them make romantic, business, or other personal decisions, which the [[priest]]s were happy to provide in exchange for a donation. With a gift of 25 [[gold piece]]s or more, the head priest  would agree to perform a 24-hour ritual in which they would "consult the guides" to experience a vision relating to the giver's questions. On occasion, this service might be denied to someone with [[evil]] intentions.

==History==
Unlike many other deities of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]], worship of Savras in Port Nyanzaru predated the [[Spellplague]], owing to his [[cleric]]s' ability to keep tabs on the threat of the [[yuan-ti]] in the jungle.

In the century following the disappearance of [[Ubtao]], Savras became one of the more prominent gods among the people of Port Nyanzaru, notably among those unafraid to speak the truth in the face of opposition. After the city rid itself of its [[Amn]]ian colonialist rulers, foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city, owing to a history of exploitation, and so the [[Church of Savras|Savrasian]] [[priest]]hood had come to be composed of native [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]].

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple was seen as one of the oldest and most impressive buildings still standing in the city. By this time, the priesthood spent little of their time monitoring jungle monsters, and instead were sought out for much more mundane portents.

During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] conspired to kill the temple's head priest. They sent bandits to cause a distraction while their [[assassin]] attempted to slip inside unnoticed.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Grandfather Zitembe]], the head priest in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Inete]], an [[acolyte]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR who was plagued by visions of the [[Red Wizard]]s during the events of the [[death curse]].
* [[Eshek]], another acolyte of Savras as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* Father [[Kenda]], an assistant priest to Grandfather Zitembe in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
