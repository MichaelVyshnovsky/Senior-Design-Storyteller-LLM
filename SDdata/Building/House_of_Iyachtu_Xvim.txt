The House of Iyachtu Xvim was a temple dedicated to Iyachtu Xvim in the Thayan city of Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples."
The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur and was adjacent to the Temple of Sharess.
The temple was one of the largest in Bezantur. It comprised a grand central hall with two long wings containing shrines as well as sleeping, dining, and storage facilities for the temples residents. A dozen smaller buildings also occupied the temple grounds, some of which served as housing for higher-ranked priests while others hosted various Xvimlar ceremonies.
The Houses congregation was one of the most enthusiastic in the city, and was known to brawl in the streets with followers of Cyric from the nearby House of Cyric.
Xvim himself was known to visit the temple and lead ceremonies.
The House of Iyachtu Xvim was constructed in the late 1360s DR as part of a push to dedicate temples to Xvim throughout Thay. The House was immediately somewhat unique among temples to Xvim as most of his places of worship were underground and/or former temples to Bane.
With the opening of the temple, tensions with the House of Cyric swiftly escalated as it was Xvims aspiration to usurp Cyrics divine portfolio. The two temples engaged in acts of assassination and magical assaults against each other.
In the late 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was Dienje Xavarri, a fanatic who was also widely considered second only to Xvim himself as the head of Xvims church in Thay.
As baneguards were popular servants at Xvims Thayan temples, it was likely that the House of Iyachtu Xvim was involved in creating and using them.
