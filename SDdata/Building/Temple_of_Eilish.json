People close enough to read the inscription of the statue were at risk of falling into its dome.\nThe dome beneath the statue was the only surviving structure of any note the  tall structure had a  pile of sand in it. The place was crawling with giant tarantulas. A magically obfuscated inscription warned against disturbing the Vanquished One, referring to Khalitharius. The area leading to Khalithariuss imprisonment chamber was magically password locked the passwords were held in a scroll room.\nKhalithariuss imprisonment chamber was warded by three rows of two statues, each of which projected a magical barrier between the statues. The first barrier was destructive cold, the second barrier was a curtain of powerful electricity, and the third one was an extremely powerful flame shield. Passwords would bypass all of those barriers and were found in the same room. Behind all the barriers was the Star of Aga-Pelar, set above an altar of white marble that altar was Khalithariuss prison.\nAfter binding Khalitharius in a lead box around the year , Martek had it taken to the Temple of Eilish, where it would be kept.\nIn , adventurers sent by Aman Al-Raqib retrieved the Star of Aga-Pelar, releasing Khalitharius in the process."
