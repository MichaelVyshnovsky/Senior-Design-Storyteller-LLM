'''Loranse''' was the manor home of Count and Countess [[Malcor Grannox|Malcor]] and [[Shyrr Sunspear-Grannox|Shyrr Grannox]] and the county seat of [[Ithmonn]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Location==
Loranse was located just west of [[Darromar|the capital]], along the northern banks of the [[River Ith]] and south of [[Ithal Road]].

==History==
The palace was the former home of the old count of Ithmonn before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]]. It was damaged during the turmoil of that time. Malcor Grannox, who was one of the richest [[Tethyr]]ians of his day, purchased the manor along with many other abused or ruined properties to have them restored, long before [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda]] rose to power and appointed him the count. He personally worked on the carpentry needed for its restoration.
