Loranse was the manor home of Count and Countess Malcor and Shyrr Grannox and the county seat of Ithmonn in Tethyr.
Loranse was located just west of the capital, along the northern banks of the River Ith and south of Ithal Road.
The palace was the former home of the old count of Ithmonn before the Interregnum. It was damaged during the turmoil of that time. Malcor Grannox, who was one of the richest Tethyrians of his day, purchased the manor along with many other abused or ruined properties to have them restored, long before Queen Zaranda rose to power and appointed him the count. He personally worked on the carpentry needed for its restoration.
