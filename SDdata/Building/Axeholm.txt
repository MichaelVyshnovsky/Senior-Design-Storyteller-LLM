Dwarves
Axeholm was a dwarven fortress carved into a mountainside, within the Sword Mountains range in the Sword Coast North. The keeps crest was a dwarven gauntlet holding a handaxe.
It was located in the northern slopes of the mountain, about a days travel south of Phandalin.
The lower halls of Axeholm included an imposing entrance gauntlet that opened up to the great hall, along with a large barracks and numerous guard posts. The dwarven protectors had easy access to their well-stocked armory and smithy. At the rear of the grand hall was the keeps throne room, as well as its dining hall and kitchens.
Long before the 1490s DR, the fortress was infiltrated by an elf named Vyldara. She was apprehended, imprisoned, and eventually killed while trying to escape custody. Risen as a banshee, Vyldara haunted the site of her death, causing the dwarves to abandon their home for other lands.
After Axeholm became haunted, a number of ghouls formed their den within within its lower halls.
