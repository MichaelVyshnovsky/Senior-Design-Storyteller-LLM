Esklindrars Maps, Books, & Folios was a book shop located in the city of Yartar. It was owned by and named after the learned sage, Esklindrar Iol.
The shop was located near the Fishyard marketplace of Yartar.
Esklindrars contained a great number of books and, by estimation of Volothamp Geddarm, it held at least a thousand treasure maps.
The ceiling of the shop was decorated with a particularly well-detailed map of Faer√ªn.
In addition to the books he sold, Esklindrar offered answers to any particular question, for the modest fee of 500 gp. The sage was quite learned on all matters related to the Sword Coast, particularly its long and storied history.
The structure of the shop was protected by a ward that inhibited any fires or explosions, whether magical or mundane in nature, from igniting within.
