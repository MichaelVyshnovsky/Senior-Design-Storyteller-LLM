        "mainbody": "The '''Incanistaeum''' was a famous academy of [[magic]] in the city of [[Myth Drannor]], whose secret was hidden to those who merely passed by. It was an entire community of [[mage]]s and other practitioners of [[the Art]], a town contained within the City of Song.",
        "Location": "The school was located on [[Phelindra Street]] within the city's multicultural district of [[Dlabraddath]].",
        "Structure": "By all appearances, the exterior of the Incanistaeum as a solid stone structure of fine [[dwarven]] construction. Only the keen eyes of a dwarf could determine that something about the building appeared \"off\".",
        "Interior": "The Incanistaeum was in fact \"built\" to comprise a great number of ''[[duo-dimension]]al'' spaces that added up to over 300 separate rooms and chambers, set across seven different floors.",
        "Activities": "The driving purposed of the Incanistaeum was to serve as a place where practitioners from all the races of Myth Drannor could study magic by instructors that were not all of [[elven]] heritage. Its founding members and first teachers were the noted mages that formed the [[Icanists' Society]], also known as the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.\n\nUnfortunately due to the nature of its founding, the Incanistaeum became a site for racial-politics between the city's more narrow-minded elves and members of its student body.",
        "History": "The Incanistaeum was established in late 4{{th}} century [[DR]], in the {{YearlinkName|379}}. and the [[were-tiger]] [[archmage]] [[Tulrun]].\n\nIn the midâ€“7{{th}} century the academy saw departure of some of its founding instructors, including [[Pyraan|Pyraan the Grim]] and [[Peridar Snowbrows]] in the {{YearlinkName|663}}, and [[Taeral Olortynaal]] who left two years later by the urging of his family. \n\nTaeral would return about a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|676}}, but was accidental killed in a spell battle between elves and humans. [[Sun elf]] students framed Taeral's death on the Incanistaeum's last remaining non-elven student, [[Arlesn]] of [[Cormyr]], who was banished from Myth Drannor forever.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|682}}, the only remaining instructor of the Incanistaeum was [[Sakaala|Sakaala of the Seven Rings]]. Both [[Mentor Wintercloak]] and the individual known as [[Nacacia|the Masked]] had departed Myth Drannor and taken with them their four remaining students.",
        "Inhabitants": "Unlike other magical academies in Myth Drannor during its time, the Incanistaeum admitted students and apprentices from any of the numerous races that took up residence within the city."
