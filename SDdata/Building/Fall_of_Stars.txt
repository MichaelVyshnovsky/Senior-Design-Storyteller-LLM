'''The Fall of Stars''' was a tavern found in [[Myth Drannor]] during the city's glory days, before the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|74}}

==Location==
It was located {{SI|75|ft|}} above ground level in the [[Sheshyrinnam]] district of the city, just east of the [[Westfields]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves/Map}}

==Structure==
This two-story tavern was constructed within the boughs of an enormous [[shadowtop]] tree. It was named for the means by which patrons could enter the establishment. Within the floor of Stars' taproom was a {{SI|20|ft}} wide hole, beneath which was a magical elevator that allowed people to ascend within.
