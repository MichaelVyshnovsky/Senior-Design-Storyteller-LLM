        "Description": "The temple was notable for the \"Pillars of Smoke,\" which were also called \"the Pipepillars.\"",
        "Activities": "The Mistkeep was the most influential place of Leiran worship throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. It was a rarity among the chaotic, rank-ignoring followers of the Lady of the Mists. The temple housed one of the largest collections of [[magic item]]s on the entire continent. The clergy used the items to subtly influence the world around them. They also crafted masks to sell in order to generate more income for the temple.",
        "Inhabitants": "Illusionmaster [[Duldinbold Alarkyn]] presided over the temple and other [[priest]]s within."
