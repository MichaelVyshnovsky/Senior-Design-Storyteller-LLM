It was a rarity among the chaotic, rank-ignoring followers of the Lady of the Mists. The temple housed one of the largest collections of magic items on the entire continent. The clergy used the items to subtly influence the world around them. They also crafted masks to sell in order to generate more income for the temple.\nIllusionmaster Duldinbold Alarkyn presided over the temple and other priests within."
