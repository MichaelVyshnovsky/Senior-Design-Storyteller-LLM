        "mainbody": "The '''Embassy of Ravens Bluff''' was the center of diplomatic relations between the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] and the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The Embassy was also entrusted to hold trade and international relations negotiations on behalf of the Bluff with nations of and near the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Location": "The Embassy of Ravens Bluff was a two-storied building located in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]], just a few blocks away from the Temple of Luck, or the [[Tower of Luck]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|9-10}} The road on which the building stood stretched from north to south for about twenty-one city blocks.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|11}}",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Embassy was led by [[Chalnath Tressoon]], the Ambassador to Waterdeep, well-respected and loved not just by the people of Ravens Bluff but also by the people of the City of splendors. The second in the chain of command was the Aid to the Ambassador and a socialite [[Richard Renqueth]], who spent most of his life in Waterdeep.\n\nAnother notable embassy employee at the time was [[Tames]], a \"Houtman\" or houseman, who's been in the Ravenaar employ for over seven years.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Ravenian Ambassador to Waterdeep, Chalnath Tressoon, was killed in a dark alley. The Ambassador's body, as well as the bodies of his bodyguards, were all found by his aide, Richard Renqueth. The clergy of [[Tymora]] could not determine the cause of death.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|6}} The government of Ravens Bluff requested [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to not be involved in the case. The request was honored, and the Ambassador's death was not publicly announced in fears of trade negotiations between [[Calimshan]] and Ravens Bluff being affected, as Chalnath Tressoon was the one helming them. The embassy itself was also raided, with much of its furniture, carpentry, and drapery in ruins. However, none of the embassy staffers was killed. All the staffers were knocked out cold with sleeping smoke bombs.\n\nThe target of the robbery was the rod. It was snatched by [[Whisper (dragon)|Whisper]] and his [[Shadowhands (guild)|Shadowhands]]. The heroes embarked on a quest to find the elusive \"Shadowed Man.\" Eventually, the search brought them to [[Undermountain]], where the [[shadow dragon]], the \"Shadowed Man\" himself, made a lair. After a confrontation, Whisper was slain, allowing the adventurers to return the rod to the Embassy and ''[[resurrect]]ing'' Chalnath Tressoon in a ritual performed by the [[cleric]]s of the nearby Tower of Luck.{{Cite organized play/LC/Dragon's Deep|24-25}}"
