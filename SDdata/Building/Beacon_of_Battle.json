        "mainbody": "The Beacon of Battle was a temple dedicated to Tempus within the city of Calimport.\nThis temple was located in the Biteq Drudach, in the Qhibal Sabban, in the Shackles Ward of Calimport.\nThis building was constructed of red-glazed bricks, stood two stories tall, and had an outward appearance similar to what many slavers houses looked like in Calimshan. Swung over the main ground-floor entrance was a silver emblem of Tempus.\nBeyond their religious duties, the clergy of this temple would regularly seek out suitable candidates among the slave masses of Shackles Ward for recruitment as gladiators for one of Calimports arenas. Some slaves sought out the attention of these priests for this, as arena slaves had a slight chance of winning their freedom."
