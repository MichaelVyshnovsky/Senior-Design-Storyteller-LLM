        "mainbody": "Geldenstags Rest was one of the oldest inns in Bryn Shander.\nThe inn was located close to Bryn Shanders East Gate.\nThe proprietor, Myrtle, was known to constantly ask her customers about what they were up to each day.\nThe inns accommodations were lackluster, with small rooms and minimal, dirty, furnishing. However, due to Myrtles constant questioning, people who had something to hide often avoided the inn. For that reason, the place was popular among travelers who wished to avoid too much excitement."
