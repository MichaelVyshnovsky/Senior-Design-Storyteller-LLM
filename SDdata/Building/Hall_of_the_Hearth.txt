The '''Hall of the Hearth''' was located within the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
An extremely high temperature was maintained within this hall, hot enough to cause clothing to smolder and [[paper]] to burst into flame. A large fire pit scented with minerals dominated the center of the chamber.

==Activities==
This hall housed the [[efreet]] who served the [[Grand Caliph]].

==Inhabitants==
Four [[salamander]]s kept the fire pit stoked to create enough heat to make the efreet comfortable. [[Fire snake]]s also lived within the fire pit.
