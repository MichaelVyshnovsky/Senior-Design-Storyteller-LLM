The Hall of the Hearth was located within the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
An extremely high temperature was maintained within this hall, hot enough to cause clothing to smolder and paper to burst into flame. A large fire pit scented with minerals dominated the center of the chamber.
This hall housed the efreet who served the Grand Caliph.
Four salamanders kept the fire pit stoked to create enough heat to make the efreet comfortable. Fire snakes also lived within the fire pit.
