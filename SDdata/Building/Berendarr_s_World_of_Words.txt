'''Berendarr's World of Words''' was a shop in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
This shop was located on the western-front of [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]], just a few doors up from the intersection known as the [[Waymoot (Waterdeep)|Waymoot]].

==Services==
Berendarr's specialized in selling [[broadsheet]]s. It hung its recent offerings from the ceiling on clips, much like one would a tapestry, while older broadsheets were rolled up and thrusted into wall-shelves
