Berendarrs World of Words was a shop in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.
This shop was located on the western-front of High Road, just a few doors up from the intersection known as the Waymoot.
Berendarrs specialized in selling broadsheets. It hung its recent offerings from the ceiling on clips, much like one would a tapestry, while older broadsheets were rolled up and thrusted into wall-shelves
