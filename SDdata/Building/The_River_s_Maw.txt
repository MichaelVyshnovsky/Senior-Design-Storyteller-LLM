The Rivers Maw was the largest temple devoted to Sebek, the Crocodile God within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
The temple was located in the city of Sekras in southern Unther on the banks of the Blue Sword River.
Sebeks followers within the temple slowly turned the population of Sekras into werecrocodiles, prompting a violent response from paladins sent by Osiris to scour the city, eventually leaving it in ruins.
