        "mainbody": "The Goldhall of the Sacraments was a temple dedicated to Waukeen located in the city of Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.\nThe temple was run by High Priest Muntiver Salesh. Muntiver was assisted by five other priests. Waukeens silence during the Time of Troubles prompted many priests and followers within the Goldhall to abandon their faith. High Priest Salesh even considered joining the worship of Cyric as he believed the new deity stole some of Waukeens power."
