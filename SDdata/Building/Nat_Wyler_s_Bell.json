        "mainbody": "'''Nat Wyler's Bell''', or simply known as the '''Bell''', was a cheap dive tavern and an inn located in the slums of [[Phlan]], of the [[Moonsea]] region.\n\n{{quote|''Damn Nat's [[firewine]]!''|[[Kestrel]]}}",
        "Location": "The Bell stood in the heart of the slum district of Phlan. Its distance made it a popular stupor for the individuals trying to avoid the city guard or the members of the [[Council of Ten]].",
        "Structure": "Nat Wyler's Bell was a small establishment of no particular note apart from its smell of stale [[ale]] and the second floor's common sleeping area with only three beds.",
        "Interior": "Even though a tiny building, it had several tables, often occupied due to the dive's low prices, a bar The main room was often busy and cramped but was pretty quiet as most guests liked to keep to themselves.\n\nThe most notable thing in the Bell was Nat Wyler, its owner. By [[1367 DR]], [[Nat Wyler]] has been dead for around 20 years, and his body has been part of the detour. His preserved body was posed behind the bar holding the titular bell of [[bronze]].",
        "Services": "Nat Wyler's Bell was known for its cheap but bland food and alcohol. Many locals with not much [[coin]] in their pockets came into the Bell to fill their bellies with food, drinks and then sleep it off in the common room upstairs.\n\nThe sleeping arrangements were not the best in the city, and the Bell used not the most comfortable [[corn]] husk-stuffed mattresses.\n\nThe Bell rented its private rooms out ''circa'' [[1340 DR]] for 12 [[sp]] a night, and the common room was priced at 8 [[cp]] per bed a night.\n\nThe food selection was limited, and most guests ordered cheap [[ale]]s, especially doughy [[bread]]s, and [[cheese]]s.",
        "History": "''Circa'' 1340 DR, following the tumult of the recent years, the Bell was a common meeting place for dangerous, unlawful individuals, ruffians, thugs, and swords-for-hire. The tavern was spread over a much bigger part of the building during that time. The Bell had eight private rooms and a much bigger common sleeping area that cost fit up to 20 customers.\n\nThen the bar was named after its one-time owner, Nat Wyler. At some point ''circa'' [[1347 DR]], he was turned into a popular, but somewhat grim attraction for the clientele of the bar.\n\nBy 1367 DR, a sneaky but friendly [[gnome]] [[Gnahac Gnarlnose]] became the owner of the Bell, and at some point, the tavern lost ownership of a big part of the building, significantly shrinking its business.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Nat Wyler's Bell served as a home for a [[thief]] [[Kestrel]] for several months. She and her fellow thieving friend [[Ragnall]] could often be seen dining in the fine establishment.. That task eventually led the sentries to travel to [[Myth Drannor]] and stopping the evil cult."
