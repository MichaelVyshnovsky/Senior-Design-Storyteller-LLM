'''Nezram's tower''' was once the home of the powerful [[Mulhorand]]i [[wizard]] named [[Nezram]].

==Location==
The tower was found along the outskirts of [[Azun]] on the western shore of the [[Lake of Salt]].

==History==
Nezram's tower was destroyed by the [[green dragon]] [[Chaathuuladroth]] in the {{YearlinkName|681}}.<ref name=OE-p5> The treasure contained within the tower was looted both by the dragon and later by Nezram's descendants. However, the lure of potential hidden powerful [[magic item]]s lured many [[adventurer]]s to explore the ruins centuries after its destruction.
