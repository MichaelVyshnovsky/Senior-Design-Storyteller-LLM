Garynmor Stables and Menagerie was a business in the Outer City of Baldurs Gate that specialized in the handling and care of mundane beasts of burden, as well as the exhibition of all manner of exotic creatures and critters.
It was owned by, and named after, the retired adventurer Ubis Garynmor who lived in the city during the late 15 century DR.
While Garynmors stables were located in both the Blackgate and Stonyeyes districts of Baldurs Gates, the menagerie only operated in the latter.
The stables was the largest of its kind in the Gates Outer City. Their two locations allowed them to move an owners animals from one side of the city to the other with relative ease.
In addition to their boarding and transportation fees, they often rented pack and draft animals to Baldurian locals in need.
What truly set the establishment apart from other animal-handling establishments was the owners collection of fantastic animals. Among the spectacles were a cockatrice, an owlbear, and a two-winged hippogriff. The entrance fee was a mere few copper pieces.
