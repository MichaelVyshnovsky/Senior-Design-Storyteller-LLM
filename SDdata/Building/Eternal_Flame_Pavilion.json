        "mainbody": "he Eternal Flame Pavilion was a temple located in the City of Brass in 1367 DR.\nThe Eternal Flame Pavilion was found in the Furnace ward of the city.\nThis mosque was sheathed with finely beaten gold.\nThe Eternal Flame Pavilion was dedicated to Agni, a fierce god who destroyed everything he touched with purifying flames. Since the priests of Agni preached the ideal of redemption and immortality, the worship of Agni was wildly popular among the common efreet, but only tolerated by the noble efreet who preferred to keep their subjects hard at work instead of praying."
