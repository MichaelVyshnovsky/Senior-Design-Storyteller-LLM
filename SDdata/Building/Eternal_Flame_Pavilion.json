        "Activities": "The Eternal Flame Pavilion was dedicated to [[Agni]], a fierce god who destroyed everything he touched with purifying flames. Since the priests of Agni preached the ideal of redemption and immortality, the worship of Agni was wildly popular among the common [[efreet]], but only tolerated by the [[noble efreeti|noble efreet]] who preferred to keep their subjects hard at work instead of praying."
