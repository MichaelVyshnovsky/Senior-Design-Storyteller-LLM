        "mainbody": "Castle Felmorel was a castle in the mid–8 century DR.\nThe castle stood somewhere to the west of the village of Hammershaws.\nThe entrance was dark-paneled on the inside. There were brass lamps.\nAt least one guestroom was small but had a high ceiling, with old tapestries and a canopied bed, with candles for light set across the room. A room not far from there, used for rituals, had a glass-smooth floor. Nasmaeraes bedchambers were accessible through a secret path leading to the back of her closet.\nThe Lord of the castle, Esbre Felmorel, was known to hold feasts with unexpected guests.\nThe gate usually sported three guards in the mid–8 century DR as of  those guards included Glavyn and Feiryn. Another man-at-arms present was called Errart. At least one chamber had protections built into the stone. By , the Lord employed one or more mages capable of using spells.\nIn spring of the , Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, invited himself at the last minute to a feast at Castle Felmorel, over the objections of one of the guards, Glavyn he used magic to disable the guards upper limbs just before the man drew his weapons. Before the situation further degenerated, Lady Nasmaerae Felmorel witnessed the exchange and personally invited him to the feast.\nThe feast Elminster joined, hosted by Lord Esbre and Lady Nasmaerae, had two other guests of note archmage Thessamel Arunder, and the warrior and explorer Barundryn Harbright. Before they joined, there were already a number of refreshments on the table, including whellusk, half-shell and all, and also soft cheese with spices. The main dishes included sauced venison, a three-serpent pie that was crusty, and a lizard soup with pepper, roasted boar, and spitted fowl. The archmage was cautiously suspicious about Elminster, who found much agreement with the explorer over the feast. While they knew nothing of Dasumia, the host and guests attested to a \"Lady of Shadows\" ruling nearby lands, with Thessamel being surprisingly quiet about her.\nLady Nasmaerae attempted to cast some spell to subsume Elminsters power or knowledge during the night, and found herself thwarted by Azuths warding over Elminster. As a warning, Azuth broke her spell-thrall over her husband and warned her that if she attempted that spell again, shed lose all her spells. Esbre immediately forced her to recast the spell, resulting in the definitive loss of her powers.\nIn the aftermath of these events, Esbre Felmorel declared Azuth would be worshiped in his home henceforth. Elminster left before dawn, and the mage Thessamel Arunder followed him out.\nDuring the brief period of spell failure in , Lord and Lady Felmorel were still married, and Lady Felmorel was concerned about the loss of spells, though she hadnt regained her own use of magic."
