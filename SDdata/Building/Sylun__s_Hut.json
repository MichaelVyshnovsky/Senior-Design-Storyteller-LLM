        "mainbody": "Sylunés Hut was once the home of Syluné, the Witch of Shadowdale. After her destruction, Sylunés Hut became little more than an empty, roofless house.\nWhen Syluné perished protecting the village from a flight of dragons in 1356 DR, her hut and the land it resided on passed to Lord Mourngrym. Mourngrym refused all attempts to claim, build, and farm on this land, which was still in a blasted condition after the dragon attacks.\nThere were rumors claiming there were portals near Sylunés Hut, which linked to other planes."
