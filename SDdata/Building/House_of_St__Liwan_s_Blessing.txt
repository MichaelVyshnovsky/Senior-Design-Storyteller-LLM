The House of St. Liwans Blessing was a monastery of Ilmater on the western coast of Calimshan.
This monastery was located high on the cliffs along the northern stretch of the Coast Trail from Teshburl to Memnon.
The House was a former caravanserai, like many of the monasteries in Calimshan.
In addition to religious activities, the House of St. Liwans Blessing served as a culinary arts school&mdashfrom exotic food to shipboard fare. Its patron saint, St. Liwan, believed that food could end suffering.
In 1370 DR, the head abbot was Revered Father Akkabar el Souvlak.
