The '''Field-Gates''' were the westernmost fortified gates of [[Suzail]], the capital city of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|64-65}}

==Location==
The Field-Gates stood on the road that stretched from the city's [[The Market (Suzail)|open-air market plaza]], westwards, past Suzail's burial garden of the [[Fields of the Dead]], and towards the [[Storm Horns]].

==Services==
Nightly, the Field-Gates allowed passage of Suzail's [[dung]]-loaded carts, hauled by [[Sundarl Nightsoils]] all through the night. The carts' destination was almost two miles outside the city walls â€“ a fertilizer field and a lime pit for disposal of Suzail's waste.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Stench Carts}}

==Defenses==
Just like the [[East Gate (Suzail)|Eastgate]], the Field-Gates were citadel-like fortifications that offered solid defenses to Suzail's west entrance. The gates were guarded by a garrison of the [[Purple Dragons]] and its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals banned from entering the capital of Cormyr.
