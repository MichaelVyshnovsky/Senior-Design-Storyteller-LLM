The '''Bordryn's Bucket''' was a tavern of some repute in the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==History==
The Bordryn's Bucket was a favorite local establishment in the city's [[Athkatla/Bridge District|Bridge District]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. However, the Bucket was not distinct enough for the famous writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] to talk about it in any detail in his book â€“ ''Volo's Guide to Baldur's Gate'', published at some point in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
