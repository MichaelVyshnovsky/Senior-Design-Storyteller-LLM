        "mainbody": "Pohtas were simple portable living structures built by the Numtanajd people of the High Desert in west Zakhara.\nA pohta was a temporary home constructed by stretching wool blankets over a rectangle frame of sticks. A pohta could be tied into a bundle for easy transport. Woolen mats were placed on the floor to shield against the hot sand of the High Desert. Pohtas were often arranged in tight circles so herd animals could be penned on the inside for added protection against predators."
