        "Description": "A ''pohta'' was a temporary home constructed by stretching wool [[blanket]]s over a rectangle frame of sticks. A ''pohta'' could be tied into a bundle for easy transport. Woolen mats were placed on the floor to shield against the hot [[sand]] of the High Desert. ''Pohtas'' were often arranged in tight circles so herd animals could be penned on the inside for added protection against predators."
