Each of the shops had a sign with its name, however, once a customer entered either door they quickly realized that both doors led to a single shop and to a single proprietor, a man named Molar.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, Molars was the only shop that traded in armor and weapons in Skull Crag, and was popular among the travelers of the High Road. Molars prices were high due to the monopoly in the village."
