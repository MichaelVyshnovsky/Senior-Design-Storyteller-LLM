Among the recorded buildings of Goldspires were
* A dance hall
* The Hospitality House, rented by rich patrons to host galas
* An infirmary

Most temple services were revels, parties and lavish banquets, funded by the faithfuls contributions.
Following the Time of Troubles, priests of Goldspires were among the first ones to accept the message of the prophet of Lliira and restore an active faith in their deity.
Goldspires was said to be supported by twelve major mercantile companies and powerful Amnian families, including seven rising merchant houses, who hoped to gain power thanks to the temples influence.
The temple was ruled by the Holycoin Voice of the Lady Tharundar Olehm, the supreme head of the church. The high priest was seconded by five Overgold sisters referred to as the Five Furies, all potential successors to his title.
