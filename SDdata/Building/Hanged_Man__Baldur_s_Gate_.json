        "mainbody": "he Hanged Man was a cheap and neglected inn and tavern in the docks area of Baldurs Gate.\nThe Hanged Man received numerous notices from the city of Baldurs Gate. These notices were proudly displayed behind the taprooms bar by the inns owner. The entire wall was upholstered with parchment like odd wallpaper.\nThe rooms were dirty and unkempt with a single ragged bed each. The walls and doors were thin so any person staying at the inn could hear snoring or other ungodly sounds coming from other guests of this fine establishment.\nThe Hanged Man was infamous for being the seediest, cheapest and the most dangerous tavern along the Sword Coast. The taproom and the inns guest rooms were crawling with vermin of both animal and humanoid nature. The inn sheltered transient pirates and bandits who needed a safe space for a few hours on their way to other destinations.\nFights broke out often in the Hanged Man and most of the time they ended in deadly bloodshed, which was evident by the permanently discolored floors due to dried blood.\nBy 1362 DR, Baldurs Gates government regularly sent out notices to the proprietors of the Hanged Man, trying to condemn the building or revoke their hostelry license, but no-one ever came to enforce. Ras Nsis Refuge Bay Trading Company had a presence in the Hanged Man. At least one representative and his trained pet giant scorpion were present there conducting business in the mid–14 century DR.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, the proprietor of the Hanged Man was a burly half-orc with putrid breath and snout-like nose."
