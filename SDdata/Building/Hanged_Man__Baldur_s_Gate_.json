        "mainbody": "The '''Hanged Man''' was a cheap and neglected inn and tavern in the docks area of [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Hanged Man was infamous for being the seediest, cheapest and the most dangerous tavern along the [[Sword Coast]]. The taproom and the inn's guest rooms were crawling with vermin of both animal and [[humanoid]] nature. The inn sheltered transient pirates and bandits who needed a safe space for a few hours on their way to other destinations.\n\nFights broke out often in the Hanged Man and most of the time they ended in deadly bloodshed, which was evident by the permanently discolored floors due to dried blood."
        },
        "History": "By [[1362 DR]], Baldur's Gate's government regularly sent out notices to the proprietors of the Hanged Man, trying to condemn the building or revoke their hostelry license, but no-one ever came to enforce. [[Ras Nsi]]'s [[Refuge Bay Trading Company]] had a presence in the Hanged Man. At least one representative and his trained pet [[giant scorpion]] were present there conducting business in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, the proprietor of the Hanged Man was a burly [[half-orc]] with putrid breath and snout-like nose."
