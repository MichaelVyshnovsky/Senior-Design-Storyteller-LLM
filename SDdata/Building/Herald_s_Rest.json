        "mainbody": "'''Herald's Rest''' was an opulent and exclusive inn, festhall, and brothel frequented by members of the [[Heralds of Faer没n|Heralds]] and the [[Harpers]].",
        "Location": "Herald's Rest was located in the city of [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Structure": "The building resembled a small castle.",
        "Interior": "Luxuriously appointed with quiet carpets, fine [[tapestries]], privacy veils, muted lighting, and exquisite furnishings.",
        "Services": "Herald's Rest offered [[prostitute|escorts]], both male and female, that were highly skilled and accommodating. There were also ''portals'' to [[Ardeep Forest]] near [[Waterdeep]], [[Silverymoon]], and [[Twilight Hall]] in central Berdusk that were discreetly made available to those willing to pay a steep fee.",
        "History": "This establishment was founded by a noble woman, reputedly a former princess, who gave up a rigidly controlled life of class and formal etiquette in order to more freely indulge in pleasure and association. The festhall was named for an auspicious visit by three past [[High Heralds]] who were extremely impressed with the decor and services&mdash;one of them even married his escort&mdash;and offered to purchase the place. Their offer was politely refused, but they were allowed to subsidize the operation during an economic downturn and thereafter the Heralds got a portion of the profits.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "* The exclusive nature of the Rest generated various rumors of treasure, important documents, and even fugitive Harpers and Heralds being hidden here.",
