The '''Furniture's Fate''' was a tavern in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] owned by [[Boffo Arglebargle Cosgrove Bullwubble II]].

==Activities==
The tavern was popular with adventurers operating out of Thunderstone, and thus it was a good spot to hear their stories.

As the name suggested, brawls were common, especially those that resulted in broken furniture. The signboard above the door even depicted a chair being broken over a person's head.

Tavernkeeper Boffo, being an eccentric prankster, was usually at the center of these brawls. When he wasn't, he usually had his bouncer [[Stig]] lift him up and hurl the gnome into the fray.
