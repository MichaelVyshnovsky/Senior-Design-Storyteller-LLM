        "mainbody": "he Three Dead Orcs was an inn in the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the 13 century DR.\nThe Three Dead Orcs burned down and, perhaps due to its name, some very much alive orcs were thought to have encouraged the flames. Afterward, Riothar Orlsyr built a new inn called The Wizards Hand to the north, some time around 1277 DR."
