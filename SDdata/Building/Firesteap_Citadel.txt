'''Firesteap Citadel''' was a military fortress in the [[Firesteap Mountains]] on the eastern side of the [[Lake of Steam]] and under the control of the city-state of [[Innarlith]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It marked the southern boundary of the territory controlled by Innarlith. It was used as a base of operations by Senator Pristoleph when he launched his invasion to overthrow the government of the city-state in 1371 DR. <ref>

==History==
[[Pristoleph]], the future Ransar of Innarlith, served as a soldier in the Innarlan military at the citadel around [[1334 DR]]. There he operated a brothel with his friend [[Wenefir]], using a [[prostitute]] named [[Nyla]] to serve the officers of the camp. [[Ptolnec]], a lieutenant, took issue with this and tried to stop him before discovering that his own superior was using its services.<ref>

Pristoleph became a wealthy senator and he had ambitions becoming the Ransar of Innarlith. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, he purchased the post of castellan for the castle and took control of it. He then secretly raised an army at the castle, including a large body of [[wemic]] mercenaries from the [[Shaar]] to the south. Ransar [[Salatis]] became aware of Pristoleph's ambitions and sent a [[spirit naga]] assassin to kill Pristoleph and his wife [[Phyrea]] at the citadel. The assassin came to Phyrea's room at night and tried to kill her, but Pristoleph discovered the creature and used his abilities as a [[fire genasi]] to scorch the assassin, who escaped out of the window.<ref>

Pristoleph and his army proceeded to make their assault on the city, which after a year-long siege they took control of in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.<ref>
