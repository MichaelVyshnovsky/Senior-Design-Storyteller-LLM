Twilight Hall was a temple dedicated to Cyric located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the Foreign Quarter.
Twilight Hall was a short structure made from black granite. The front double doors were made from copper and Cyrics holy symbol adorned them.
Tombs filled with notable worshipers of Cyric, including Lord Chess after a special arrangement was made with Khelben Arunsun in Waterdeep, could be found in the subterranean section beneath the temple. 
The entire temple was warded with protection from magic and protection from good spells. Arcane magic and magic items of any kind would not function within Twilight Hall, though divine magic worked normally. This reflected Cyrics utter hatred of Mystra.
Religious services were held twice daily an hour before dawn and an hour after sunset. A special service was held once per week at midnight, and extremely special events were held during solar eclipses.
Fornault Blacksun was High Priest of the temple in . He was assisted by 16 acolytes.
