Nortales Hostel was a small establishment that offered common room lodgings in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR run by the hin Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale.
Nortales Hostel was a small two-storied building located in the Heapside district of the Lower City, just east of the Baldurs Mouth offices, separated from it by a small plaza.
Nortales Hostel offered common room lodgings and served as a shelter for the needy in wartime. The Hostel Mother was the only person who ran the establishment and directed guests to unclaimed bunk beds and bathtubs, all located upstairs. Guests only had to follow a set of strict rules in order to stay they had to be considerate of others, they had to clean up their own mess, no ritual sacrifices were allowed on the back porch, no singing and dancing after sunset, only a single bucket of clean water per tub, and no "intimacy" clients.
By the time the Absolute crisis brought war to the city of Baldurs Gate in the , Hostel Mother Pammella Nortale was its only manager and owner. She ran the lodgings as a non-profit refugee shelter as the city was flooded by the people fleeing the encroaching army. Pammella was struggling and sought financing and donors among the nobility of the city. She penned a letter to Lord Whitburn, who once claimed that hed love to donate if only he had funds. Hostel Mother pointed out the Lords recent marriage and coming into money and openly asked for the promised large donation. Some members of the nobility were also admirers of Pammella Nortale and her work. Young Derque Rillyn was a regular sponsor but could not make donations above his regular amounts, as per her father Hir Rillyns instructions. However, Derque suggested renaming the lodgings to Hir Rillyns Hostel, as that would likely encourage the noble to finance it.
