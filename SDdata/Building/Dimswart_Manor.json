        "mainbody": "organizations =\n}}\n'''Dimswart Manor''' was a summer home of the Sage of [[Suzail]], Dimswart, and his family. By [[1357 DR]], he was happily retired there living with his wife [[Leona]] and a large number of servants.",
        "Location": "Dimswart Manor was located about half a day's ride north of Suzail and two days away from [[Storm Horns]].",
        "Structure": "The famous Sage of Suzail's manor was, in reality, a large farm, barely big enough to be considered suitable for a summer home by a noble family from Waterdeep.\n\nThe main building had a roof tiled with red shingles. It had three chimneys and walls of solid stonework. The grounds of the manor were teeming with trimmed hedges and flowerbeds.",
        "History": "In 1357 DR, [[Alias]] of [[Westgate]] sought the sage's help with the mysterious azure magical glyph tattoo that she woke up with one day. She arrived at the Dimswart Manor just a few days ahead of his daughter [[Gaylyn]]'s wedding to a member of the noble [[Wyvernspur family]]. Dimswart agreed to help the swordswoman in exchange for rescuing a [[bard]] named [[Olive Ruskettle]] who was hired to sing at the wedding but was captured by a fearsome [[red dragon]] on her way to the manor. Alias successfully returned the [[halfling]] bard and brought her just in time to save the wedding.\n\nThe wedding reception was eventually ruined by Alias herself. The azure glyphs forced her to attack the groom's cousin [[Giogioni Wyvernspur|Giogi]] after confusing him with [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|King Azoun]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Dimswart and his wife Leona resided in the manor surrounded by a small army of servants; one of them was a maid named [[Leah]]. Dimswarts' daughters lived with him in the past but in his older age, they all were eventually married off."
