        "mainbody": "Sharess Caress was a festhall located on Wyrms Crossing in the Outer City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nSharess Caress stood on the eastern side of Wyrms Crossing – the bridge that connected Rivington and the Twin Songs neighborhoods of the Outer City, just past the checkpoint gate that allowed entrance to the bridge, across the street from Fraygos Flophouse.\nThe festhall was a structure of three stories and one sub-level. It opened into a thin taproom filled with seats at the bar, the hostess counter, and several booths. The taproom had one stair up to the second and third floors and two stairs to the sub-level – the kitchen and its large larder to the left from the entrance and a curtained entertainment chamber with a stage and musical instruments. The second and third floors had more seating and tables available for the guests, and the third floor expanded across the bridge to the western side and housed several thematic lodgings where guests met similarly thematic escorts.\nThe second entrance into the festhall was accessible from the bridges walkways that overlooked the cliffs and the River Chionthar on the opposite side of the building. The walkway had several tables available to customers who preferred fresh river air to perfumes and incense of Sharess.\nThe \"Nymphs Grotto\" room was decorated in a sylvan manner and had a sizable bath. \"Elminsters Library\" was styled after a wizards lair. The \"Underdark Pleasures\" room was quite self-explanatory. And lastly, \"Devils Den\" was a lavish and splendorous room fit to satisfy some of the most posh devils.\nDuring the Absolute crisis of the , Mamzell Amira, the festhalls proprietress, sought investigators who would be interested in seeking out the coinlass named Ffion Goldgrind, better known as the \"Stern Librarian,\" who disappeared and left her clients bookings unattended. Ffion fell victim to the Murder Tribunal cultists of Bhaal, and her body was discovered next door at Fraygos Flophouse. During the same time, one special consort took residence in the festhalls \"Devils Den.\" This suave individual was Raphael, who used the room to forge infernal contracts rather than offering sexual favors.\nthumb|450x450px|Investigator Valeria celebrating her inept investigations concussion on the second floor of the Caress.\n* Amira, the festhalls over in the late 15 century DR and the owner of especially vain cat named Kira.\n*Ffion Goldgrind, the dwarvish coinlass who entertained guests of \"Elminsters Library.\"\n*Hoots Hooligan, a big and intimidating bartender.
