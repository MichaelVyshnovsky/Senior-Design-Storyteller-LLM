The Adamantine Palace was the seat of power for the monarchs who reigned over the dwarven kingdom of Ammarindar, located within the royal city of Splendarrmornn.
The entire palace was constructed from the extremely rare, and nearly indestructible black alloy, adamantine. It featured spectacularly engravings, crafted from gold and silver, inlaid with shimmering gems.
Following the collapse of Ammarindar in 882 DR, the royal capital of Splendarrmornn was plundered by fiendish tanarukks in 1220 DR. During the sacking of the city, many of the decorative inlays and gem stones were stripped away from the Adamantine Palace, though some signs of the dwarves wealth still remained.
