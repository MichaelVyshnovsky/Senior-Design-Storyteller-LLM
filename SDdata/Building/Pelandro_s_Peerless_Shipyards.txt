Pelandros Peerless Shipyards was a shipbuilder based out of Teziir on the Dragon Coast in the late 15 century DR.
The shipyards were run by Pelandro Rahavillar in the late 15 century DR and specialized in the construction of large unarmed old-design battle caravels that lacked battling rams. Pelandros was known for its low prices, and the vessels produced by Pelandro Rahavillar could be used as both warships and merchants vessels.
