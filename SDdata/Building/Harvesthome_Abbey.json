The main window was formed in the shape of the sun and set over the main doorway.\nWithin the abbey was a raised gallery, rested upon a number of columns.\nIn the rear area of the structure was a large bell, made of bronze, whose ringing signified the beginning of daily prayers.\nWithin Harvesthome Abbey there lived two black bears, Darlow and Tilbee.
