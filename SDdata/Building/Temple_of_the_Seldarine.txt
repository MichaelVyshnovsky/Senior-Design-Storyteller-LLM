The '''Temple of the Seldarine''' was a large temple complex located in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]]. 

==Description==
Its main building was topped by a dome and was split into areas dedicated to the worship of the individual gods of the [[Seldarine]], as well as a central chamber. The temple was set in a parkland containing evergreen trees and [[poplar]]s. 

==History==
The Temple of the Seldarine was created by the [[sun elf|sun elves]].

[[Angharradh]] was not represented here because the sun elves do not regard her as part of the Seldarine. This did not cause ill feelings amongst the other elves.
