        "mainbody": "'''Malabog's castle''' was a fortress in the [[Feywild]] and also the personal domain of the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]].",
        "Location": "Quite fittingly, Malabog's castle was located within his [[Realm of Malabog|own personal domain]] found within the Feywild.",
        "Structure": "Like all fomorian fortresses, Malabog's castle was both imposing, perilous and unnaturally alluring.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The inner halls of Malabog's castle were unearthly and sinister. They were eerily illuminated by fluttering [[will-o'-wisp]]s, phosphorescent [[fungi|mushrooms]], and glimmering crystals."
        },
        "Defenses": "The great stone walls served as the first line of protection for the inner castle, each of which was well guarded by siege [[catapult]]s to turn away defenders.",
        "History": "The castle was originally constructed by scores of [[cyclopes]] that were enslaved by King Malabog.\n\n''Circa'' the [[Faer√ªn]]ian {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the fomorian king led an assault on [[New Sharandar]] in the [[Feywild]], staged from his castle within his realm. His agents began to open up passageways from their realm to that of the elves, corrupt the innocent beings of nature they encountered along the way. He launched this campaign of conquest with the aid of the [[lich]] [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], who granted him control over the [[blue dragon]] [[Fulminorax]] for his efforts.\n\nIn response, the [[Iliyanbruen]] elves led by [[Iliyasha Guidingstar]] and [[Merrisara Winterwhite]] conscripted the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] of [[Neverwinter]] to stop King Malabog and route his army of giants and dark [[fey]]. After aiding the elves of the Feywild, the heroes ventured through the [[realm of Malabog]], and launched their assault on Malabog's castle. \n\nThe heroes demolished the siege towers and slayed the [[troll|fell troll]] troops they encountered outside Malabog's, stormed its walls, and defeated the giants stationed along them. At the same time, another competing party of five adventurers had breached the castle as well. Regardless of these other assailants, the heroes slew the fomorian commander [[Krol Nightforge]] and made their way to the castle's throne room, where they defeated Malabog himself. They chased down Fulminorax along the castle grounds and slew the great blue dragon in a grand courtyard, but were unable to stop Valindra from fleeing the realm.\n\nWith its great leader dead, Malabog's Castle lay in ruin.",
        "Inhabitants": "Malabog's castle was also home to the fomorian king's great army. It comprised the fomorian giant overseers and military commanders, formations of elite cyclops warriors, and a great number of dark fey creatures, such as [[troll]] and [[redcap]] servants that were considered largely expendable."
