The '''Temple of Sharess''' in [[Bezantur]] was a decadent and debauched place of worship dedicated to [[Sharess]].

==Location==
The temple was located in northern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples" in [[Thay]]. Appropriately, it was adjacent to other temples, most immediately [[Loviatar's Manor]] across the street to the south and the [[House of Iyachtu Xvim]] across the street to the east.

==Structure==
The main temple was an octagonal structure with a large dome. Several smaller hexagonal shrines radiated from this central building.

==Activities==
The temple hosted daily sermons about the importance of enjoying life to the fullest, and advocated for worldly pleasure and excess. Each [[tenday]], the temple hosted a "High Worship" ceremony which was just a massive party at which revelers overate, overdrank, and overindulged in all manner of pleasures of the flesh.

==History==
Worship of Sharess was somewhat new in Bezantur as of the  mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and the temple stood out as one of the few dedicated to a [[chaotic good]] deity in the city. However, two factors made her worship suitable to the city's inhabitants: her association with [[Shar]] and the fact that Bezantur was a decadent city, thus the hedonism preached at the temple strongly resonated with many residents. As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the temple was one of the most popular and fastest growing congregations in the city, and was stealing popularity away from the worship of both [[Loviatar]] and [[Sune]]. The [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Temple of Sune]] even retaliated by spreading rumors that Sharess's congregation was uncivilized and crude.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the temple was run by high priest [[Haldran]] and his acolytes.
