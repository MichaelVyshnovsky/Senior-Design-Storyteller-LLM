Asdefks Inn was a popular inn and tavern in the capital city of Darromar in Tethyr. It was known for its extremely spicy Calishite and Tashalaran dishes, but was overpriced.
The building was located on the west side of Star Street in the Temple Quarter of the city, directly across from the Wheel Market.
