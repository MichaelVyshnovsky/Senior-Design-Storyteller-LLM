        "mainbody": "'''The Merry Mer-She''' was a tavern in the town of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It stood in the southern half of the city, over the road from the harbor and located two buildings south of the riverbank and three buildings upstream of the southern end of [[Flying Fish Bridge]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Loudwater Layout}}",
        "Description": "The entrance had a pair of green doors in an arch.",
        "Atmosphere": "It had a wild and tumultuous atmosphere most nights. The music was loud, whether played by minstrels or bawled out by patrons, making it hard to hear even something shouted one's way, and there were bawdy jokes and pranks and general revelry. The floor was often dense with whirling dancers or brawling fighters. The beer was watery, and likely to be splashed or quaffed, even thrown in a full tankard, while stronger liquors were particularly potent. It was a place for mindless fun, not relaxation or conversation or appreciation of drinks, but women were likely to be pinched and men to be punched. It was without a doubt the most messy, most disorderly, and most disreputable tavern in Loudwater.",
        "History": "The tavern was established by [[1366 DR]] and still in operation through [[1370 DR]] and [[1372 DR]]."
