The Palace of Sly Ravens was the seat for the Caliph of Liham, Harin al-Hayif, in 1367 DR.
Located in Liham, the palace did not stand out from the buildings surrounding it.
The Palace of Sly Ravens was made from stucco that had been white-washed. The most distinguishing feature of the palace was the bright red tiles that graced the entire floor of the building.
Modest murals decorated the walls, but the palace was not as opulent as other palaces within Zakhara.
The caliph of Liham called the palace home.
