        "mainbody": "The City Court, also known as The Ladys Court the High Courts, or simply the Court, was the most prominent courthouse in the city of Sigil and the main headquarters of the Fraternity of Order.Originally, it was written that after the events of a conflict referred to as the \"Faction War\", the Fraternity of Order was one of six factions that abandoned the city of Sigil, establishing a new headquarters elsewhere. In the case of the Fraternity, this was the Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment in Mechanus. However, Planescape Adventures in the Multiverse does not fully acknowledge the events of the Faction War and depicts the Fraternity headquarters as still being the City Court.\nThis building was located in the Ladys Ward of Sigil. The area around the building was referred to by locals as being the Court District.\nAs one of the High Houses of its ward, the City Court displayed the power and wealth of the Fraternity of Order. Its total height was  and it measured  wide.\nThe building had a granite foundation, with granite steps leading up to it, but the City Court itself was hewn from flawless white marble and sported bladed gables. Marble pillars flanked the outside of the elevated entryway, above which hung a triangular architrave that had the factions motto etched into it, \"Knowledge is power\".\nthumb|273px|Measurements, a floor layout, and rough map of its the roads around the City Court.\nThe entryway of the building opened into a large promenade that encircled the first floor. Close to the entrance was a reception area, which opened into the Grand Court. Adjoining the reception area were also a small office and cloak room. Lesser court rooms could be found on every floor of the building and were considered public, civically owned spaces. Attached to each of these was a private chamber, which acted as a meeting place and study room for both the judges and counsels of nearby trial cases.\nThe main floor of the Court also hosted a set of private quarters for the organizations factol. These were connected to the Grand Courts chambers by a short hallway and were one of the many spaces in the building to have stairs leading down into the factions private library.)\nBesides further lesser court rooms, the second floor of the City Court featured the offices of the Fraternity of Orders Bureau Chiefs (Factors), wherein they discussed their cases and reached their decisions. The second floor was also host to dormitories for the factions Aides (Namers), quarters for its Administrators (Factotums), and a twin set of chambers that housed a fraction of Sigils court records. Within these chambers were hidden portals that opened into several demiplanes, wherein the actual majority of Sigils court records were stored. Only members of at least factol level had clearance to these portals. Above this, the first two floors of the tower were taken up by lesser courts, and the top floor of the tower housed faction offices.\nBeneath the building stood the Vault of Knowledge, a private library accessible only to members of the Fraternity of Order, which could be accessed by stairs darted throughout the first floor. This library spanned a depth of three sublevels, each ranging  in height from floor to ceiling. All three levels were packed with all manner of perfectly arranged and catalogued books and scrolls on law, spells, and a wide range of other topics. Practically every known spell in the multiverse was said to be housed throughout the collection. The collected works of the library were regularly referenced by the Courts judges.\nA later addition to the building was the Hall of Concordance, which acted as an embassy for the inevitables of Primus and the forces of lawfulness.\nWithin the halls of the City Court were where most legal matters in city of Sigil were settled. Most of the serious cases were tried in what was referred to as \"Ward Court\", which was conducted in any one of the buildings lesser court rooms, while \"High Court\" cases were held only in the Grand Court chamber. Each cases was overseen by a single, impartial magistrate. Magistrates were typically members of the Fraternity of Order, those known as Bureau Chiefs, though sometimes a judge could be a modron or a dabus accompanied by a translator.\nThose of the namer rank in the Fraternity of Order worked for the City Court as court recorders, file clerks, and research assistants, following the orders of factotums so long as they didnt conflict with an ongoing task. Though some namers were forced to carry out far more menial duties in the City Court, such as cleaning or guarding. Most guard duty was carried out by members of the Harmonium and Mercykillers, rather than Guvners.\nThe Court strongly encouraged those facing trial to have an advocate to represent them, though there was nothing preventing someone from representing themselves in court. They could be hired by anyone for a fee, though the Fraternity assigned such advocates pro-bono to any members of the organization facing trial.  Outside the front steps of the City Court itself, all manner of cheap freelance advocates hawked their services for those who would listen, bedecked in brocades, robes, and wigs. Such advocates ranged the gamut from baatezu, tieflings, agents of other planar factions in the city, and bards.\nThe City Court was a heavily active space, with crowds of people coming and going from the building all the time. This level of activity could come across as though the courts were chaotic and disorganized, but the Fraternity maintained a steady scheduling that ensured the legal body of Sigil ran smoothly. However, the hecticness of the Court did leave some vulnerable to being pickpocketed or strongarmed by thieves.\n* Aratik Melber the Mad, one of three most notorious judges of the City Court. He was a gitzherai and member of the Revolutionary League, known for his unpredictable rulings. Eventually he was sent away into one of the Lady of Pains mazes.\n* Black Ogutus, one of the three most notorious judges of the City Court. He was a nearsighted human cleric of Ptah and was most often the one tasked with hearing cases brought by people from the Prime Material.\n* Jamis, a human Oghmanyte cleric and the Bureau Chief of the Ad Hoc Bureau of Courts.\n* Kartina, an erinyes who worked as the clerk of Ylvirron the Cloven. She was known for her agonizingly thorough cross-examinations.\n* Kolyarut, the machine originator of the inevitables of the same name, ratified contracts in the Hall of of Concordance upon solid sheets of gold.\n* The Ladys Own Judge and Executioner, a cowled figure with a deep voice that was implied to be a representative of the Lady of Pain. Their appearance as judge in a case was seen as a bad omen, as typically the Executioner only showed up for cases where death seemed to be a certainty.\n* Ylvirron the Cloven, one of the three most notorious judges of the City Court. He was a cornugon who cared more for profit than justice, often inflicting various fees and fines upon any who found themselves in his court. His rulings were known for being harsh, but perfectly logical within the legal framework of Sigil.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff traveled to the city of Sigil to meet with a sage on behalf of Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden and Lady Lauren DeVillars, who both desired to established a planar trade network through the aid of a recently made alliance with a group of githzerai. When they finally arrived to the office of this sage, Zevon, the adventurers discovered his murdered body and not long after were apprehended by a patrol of Harmonium aasimar, having been mistaken for his murderers. They were placed in special manacles that inflicted pain upon those who tried to cast alteration or abjuration magic. A very formally dressed half-elf by the name of Korelstick later informed the adventurers that, as Zevon was a well-known figure in Sigil, a trial for them had been swiftly arranged and set to take place within an hour.\nSources differ on whether their advocate for the trial was a human named Corvain, who charged a sum of 300 gold pieces, or a baatezu named Gorbon that charged 1000 gp for his services and admitted to having lost a case previously that same week. What sources do agree on is that the judge who presided over their case was the enigmatic \"Ladys Own Judge and Executioner\" and that their arrival made the advocate quite anxious. Some sources say the advocate managed to convince the judge of that were was insufficient evidence to prove the adventurers guilty, resulting in a verdict of exile from Sigil until evidence could be found that they were completely innocence.\nFor those who said Corvain was the advocate, the adventurers either had a portal opened by the court to their home or Corvain arranged a guide to escort them to the gate-town of Glorium. Sources claiming it was Gorbon that defended them say the adventurers were offered a choice between a portal to their home or being transported to either the gate-town of Plague-Mort or Ribcage."
