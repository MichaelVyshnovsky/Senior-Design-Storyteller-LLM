'''Jerdan's Smithy''' was a blacksmith's shop found in [[Daggerford]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It could be found in the [[Farmers' Quarter]] in the north side of town.

==Services==
While the Jerdan wasn't quite as skilled as Daggerford's two [[dwarven]] blacksmiths, he found his niche in the Daggerfordian economy. He forged all manner of items that his customers requested, much of which the other smiths could not be bothered to work on.
