Jerdans Smithy was a blacksmiths shop found in Daggerford during the late 15 century DR.
It could be found in the Farmers Quarter in the north side of town.
While the Jerdan wasnt quite as skilled as Daggerfords two dwarven blacksmiths, he found his niche in the Daggerfordian economy. He forged all manner of items that his customers requested, much of which the other smiths could not be bothered to work on.
