        "mainbody": "The Red House was a boarding house located in the Low City of Bral.\nThe large house was located on the trailing side of the Lower Market off Eel Street.\nWhile falling apart on the outside, the Red House was surprisingly well-kept and even cozy on the inside.\nThe boarding house had nine single rooms and three double rooms, which were intended for families. All were clean and comfortable. Compared to many other such locations on the Rock of Bral, the Red House was a good place to stay.\nEach room cost five gold pieces per month. Boarders were only charged at the end of a month for whichever meals they had eaten, at a rate of two silver pieces per three meals eaten.\nThe Red House was owned by a gnomish woman named Gertreid, who was married to a retired pirate and tinkerer. Gertreid cooked three meals a day for her patrons."
