The Secret Maze of Kharan was an amusement in the city of Phoenix within the Raurin.
The building lay submerged beneath the sands in the city of Phoenix.
The Secret Maze of Kharan was accessible from the street just outside the entry room of Khalif Mubrek there was an open door to a darkened room beyond. It was divided in two sections the Maze of Darkness, a maze with 4-foot corridors made of a stone that absorbed just about all light, and the Maze of Light, whose walls were made of mirrored white marble and abundant in torches, but not less claustrophobic. The maze of light was accessible through a teleporter in the Maze of Darkness, a  silver disc. It opened unto the home of Chininsk Ambar.
