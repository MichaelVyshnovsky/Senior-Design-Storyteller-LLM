The establishment was among the very few places open to non-citizens of Samarach. The taverns taproom was constructed in a traditional way for drinking establishments in Samarach. The taproom was built in the shape of a cross. Tables, booths, and places to mingle were placed at each end of the structure. At the center stood the bar from where the innkeeper did business. The Forgotten Pearl employed musicians and dancers who entertained its guests. The inns specialty was seafood, evident by a faint scent of fresh catch wafting from the establishment open doors.\nIn the , a local street musician, Redfeyer, visited the Forgotten Pearl to drink his sadness away after surviving a trip to the Singing Caverns east of Rassatan. He had lost his prized singing pendant."
