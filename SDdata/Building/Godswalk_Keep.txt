The Godswalk Keep  was a castle located in the Barony of Great Oak within the Border Kingdoms. The keep was so named because of the presence of several deities on random nights.
Once a proud fortress during the height of Netheril, the Godswalk Keep was home to bizarre activity. For unknown reasons, an avatar of Garagos would appear within the keep on random nights, slaughtering anything he came into contact with. Avatars of Jergal and Sharess appeared on the same night. Garagos always tried to slay them but was never successful. He vented his frustrations with great screams giving the bizarre event the name the Meeting of the Three.
