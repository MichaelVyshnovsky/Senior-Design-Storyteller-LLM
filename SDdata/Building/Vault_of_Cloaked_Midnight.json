        "mainbody": "The '''Vault of Cloaked Midnight''' was a temple of [[Vhaeraun]] in [[Ultoksamrin]] around which a settlement of followers of the same deity grew. It was led by [[Vokkrzyr Rualfren]], a [[cleric]] of Vhaeraun.",
        "Structure": "The Vault of Cloaked Midnight was situated in the ruling cavern of [[Ultoksamrin]], a 1000-foot-high (300 meters) grotto, a mile (1.6 kilometers) beneath [[Mount Sarengard]].\n\nThe temple occupied about half of the cavern and the drow who weren't living there lived in the old dwarven clanholds for defensive reasons.",
        "Development": "The drow in Ultoksamrin were escapees from the city of [[Guallidurth]]. They were followers of Vhaeraun and fled from religious persecution at the hand of Lolth's matriarchy. They fled and built settlements in Ultoksamrin and the [[Forest of Mir]]. One of the settlements in the Forest of Mir was Allsihwann, alongside Dallnothax, Holldaybim and Iskasshyoll. When Allsihwann was destroyed by the combined forces of [[Tethyr]] and surface [[elves]], the drow fled to Ultoksamrin.\n\nDespite this development, the settlement's leader [[Vokkrzyr Rualfren]] tried to invite surface elves to bolster the cathedral city's numbers, with the goal to hurt Guallidurth. Whether he had success isn't known.",
        "Enemies": "Ultoksamrin's tunnels were divided into territories by several different races all hostile to each other, out of whom the [[drow]] were the most successful."
