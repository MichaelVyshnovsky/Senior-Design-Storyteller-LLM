        "mainbody": "The Vault of Cloaked Midnight was a temple of Vhaeraun in Ultoksamrin around which a settlement of followers of the same deity grew. It was led by Vokkrzyr Rualfren, a cleric of Vhaeraun.\nThe Vault of Cloaked Midnight was situated in the ruling cavern of Ultoksamrin, a 1000-foot-high (300 meters) grotto, a mile (1.6 kilometers) beneath Mount Sarengard.\nThe temple occupied about half of the cavern and the drow who werent living there lived in the old dwarven clanholds for defensive reasons.\nThe drow in Ultoksamrin were escapees from the city of Guallidurth. They were followers of Vhaeraun and fled from religious persecution at the hand of Lolths matriarchy. They fled and built settlements in Ultoksamrin and the Forest of Mir. One of the settlements in the Forest of Mir was Allsihwann, alongside Dallnothax, Holldaybim and Iskasshyoll. When Allsihwann was destroyed by the combined forces of Tethyr and surface elves, the drow fled to Ultoksamrin.\nDespite this development, the settlements leader Vokkrzyr Rualfren tried to invite surface elves to bolster the cathedral citys numbers, with the goal to hurt Guallidurth. Whether he had success isnt known.\nUltoksamrins tunnels were divided into territories by several different races all hostile to each other, out of whom the drow were the most successful."
