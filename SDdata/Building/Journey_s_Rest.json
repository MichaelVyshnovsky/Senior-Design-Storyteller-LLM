        "mainbody": "The Journeys Rest was an inn in Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR that was operated by the vampires Ryanna and Moria.\nthumb|A 14 century DR map of Journeys Rest.\nThe Journeys Rest was  south of Hultail along the Hullack Trail.\nThe inn consisted of a large common room with tables, booths, and a bar. The kitchen and storeroom sat behind the bar, as well as the private bedroom of the owners, which had a secret door to the outside for quick escapes.\nUpstairs, seven double bedrooms were available, with another for Maris and Cora, and two bathing rooms for men and women equipped with copper tubs and stoves.\nA large two-story barn served as a stable for visitors mounts. The victims of Ryanna and Moria were buried under the dirt floor there in shallow graves.\nIn 1369 DR, the Journeys Rest had five people who saw to its function.\n* Ryanna and Moria, predatory vampires.\n* Ratakos, an opportunistic necromancer.\n* Maris and Cora, two innocent barmaids.\nThe inn operated for some time in the 14 century DR, but eventually fell to ruin. In the , the inn was rebuilt and refurbished by a young couple and two handymen they hired, only for them to all be killed by Ryanna and Moria. The vampires liked the idea of letting their prey come to them, so they took to operating the inn themselves. Their first prospective victim was the necromancer Ratakos, who turned the tables on them and forced them to make a deal.\nRatakos posed as a customer and used his necromantic abilities to create simple undead that would harass travelers near the inn, prompting them to stay the night rather than move on. The vampires would feast on the victim, and Ratakos would then have a fresh corpse to study and use. Before they could ensnare and murder too many more people, one night the clientele included the noble Rhyn Mournsoul, the bard Alanis Dirgesong, the Sembian merchant Portis Alvermantle, and a group of adventurers hired by Lord Partic Thistle. Portis suspected something was wrong at the inn and left during the night, while Rhyn and Alanis were too important to risk \"disappearing\" at the inn. This left the adventurers as the only prey, who potentially fought off the vampires attack that night, freeing it of its deadly innkeepers."
