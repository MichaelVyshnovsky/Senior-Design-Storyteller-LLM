Elahzad, which was also called the House of the Moon, was an ancient Eldathyn holy site located within Anauroch.
The House of the Moon was a circular structure made from chalky translucent desert rock. The entire building sat within a lake in the center of a grove surrounded by many smaller springs.
The Bedine believed the site was initially a temple to Sel√ªne until the sun goddess Atar drove her away so she could make it a prison for Eldath whose beauty she was jealous of.
Within Elahzad, Eldath could speak through the mouth of any woman who entered the temple. Magic items of Eldath could be recharged here through prayer.
