        "mainbody": "'''The Hoe''' was a cheap and seedy tavern in the city of [[Cedarsproke]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] of [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The city of [[Cedarsproke]] could be considered sleepy and serene by some, being inhabited mostly by [[druid]]s who sought a peaceful life. However, the city held religious significance to the [[Church of Eldath]] and the [[Church of Silvanus]], bringing many pilgrims to the druidic stronghold. Another locale that attracted guests was the [[Earthome College]]. It led to the spawning of half-a-dozen inns and taverns. The Hoe was among them. This cheap and seedy establishment could be found at the lakefront."
