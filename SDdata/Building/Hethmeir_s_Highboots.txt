Hethmeirs Highboots was a shop located in Everlund.
Around 1370 DR, the store sold the finest custom-tailored boots in all of Faer√ªn (though the corvisors of Waterdeep might have taken exception to this). Along with being of very fine quality, the boots were made with incredible speed, usually being available within three days.
Boots from Hethmeirs could be made from just about any hide and ranged in price from 50 to 1000 gold pieces.
