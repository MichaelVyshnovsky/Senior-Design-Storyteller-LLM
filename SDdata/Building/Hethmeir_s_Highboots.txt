'''Hethmeir's Highboots''' was a shop located in [[Everlund]].

==Services==
Around [[1370 DR]], the store sold the finest custom-tailored [[boot]]s in all of [[Faer√ªn]] (though the corvisors of [[Waterdeep]] might have taken exception to this). Along with being of very fine quality, the boots were made with incredible speed, usually being available within three days.

==Goods==
Boots from Hethmeir's could be made from just about any hide and ranged in price from 50 to 1000 [[gold piece]]s.
