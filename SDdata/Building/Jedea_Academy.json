        "mainbody": "The '''Jedea Academy''' was a school for [[magic]] located in the residential district of city of [[Mordulkin]] in [[Chessenta]].",
        "Description": "The Jedea Academy was a two-story complex, built of white stone that shone brilliant in the sun, but was otherwise austere and unornamented. At each of the four corners stood four square towers. The sloping roof was tiled in slate, gray as twilight. The entrance was an ornate oaken door. Inside was a well-stocked library and carpeted floors. There were also corridors leading to a number of offices and other rooms, with metal stairways to the next floor.\n\nThe grounds of the Jedea Academy were tidy green lawns, with a white [[granite]] path leading from the street to the entrance.\n\nThe school was extensive, although it was not as big as the college of mages in [[Cimbar]].",
        "History": "The school was founded by [[Soldim Jedea]], the first ruler of the city after its revolt against the [[Unther]]ic empire It would become the oldest school for magic in the city.\n\nOver its centuries of operation, the Jedea Academy produced many capable wizards loyal to Mordulkin, boosting its arcane resources.\n\nIn the winter of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], [[Ythnel Duumin]], [[Kestus Aentius]], [[Muctos Dapritus]] and [[Kohtakah]]—surviving members of the [[Mage Society]] of [[Luthcheq]]—were invited to the Jedea Academy for a secret meeting with King [[Hercubes Jedea]]. He offered his aid in returning them to Luthcheq to sabotage the tyranny there.\n\nWhen Mordulkin later marched to war against Luthcheq, many professors of the academy enlisted to aid the war effort, which increased class sizes for those who remained.",
        "Staff": "In 1374 DR, the Head Librarian was [[Ovros Thilymm]]. Muctos Dapritus was appointed as an adjunct professor."
