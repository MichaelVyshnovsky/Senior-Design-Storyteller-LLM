        "mainbody": "The '''Harvest Hall''' was a temple of [[Chauntea]] in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "The Harvest Hall was the largest temple in Wheloon, but a modest one.",
        "History": "The Harvest Hall had a long history in Wheloon, dating back nearly as far as the [[Wyvern Ferry]]. It served generations of Whelunians.\n\nBy [[1358 DR]], it was headed by [[Harandave Donohar]], a famed [[priest]] of Chauntea. He still held the position in [[1369 DR]].\n\nFollowing Harandave's death, his daughter [[Katriana Donohar]] took over as head of the temple. She held the position by [[1374]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple was led by Harandave Donohar until his death, after which he was succeeded by his daughter, Katriana Donohar. They had thirteen followers or attendants, all minor priests.",
        "Services": "In addition to regular services, all were welcomed into the Harvest Hall, and it served as a popular local meeting place. During harvest festivals, the temple gave agricultural produce to the poor of Wheloon.\n\nKatriana Donohar was usually at the temple, managing affairs there. She had a large number of [[divine magic|divine]] [[scroll]]s, dating back to Harandave's day, which she sold to those she believed would use them for good deeds. The minor priests often journeyed out into the countryside to assist farmers."
