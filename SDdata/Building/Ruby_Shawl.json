        "mainbody": "'''The Ruby Shawl''' was a [[festhall]] located in the city of [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It stood among the 3- and 4-story 'tall houses' of the wealthy Berduskan merchants that ringed the Castle Hill area.",
        "Structure": "Like other such establishments in Berdusk, the Ruby Shawl's signboard was illuminated with ''[[continual faerie fire]]'', so that it glowed at night.",
        "Atmosphere": "[[Volo]] charitably described the Ruby Shawl as the typical \"another\" festhall of any city, and clarified he meant it was \"a coarse, sleazy hole\". It was known for its drunk and desperate clientele, and Volo cautioned that only the drunk and desperate need try.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Persistent stories told of an invisible magical brooch that had been misplaced by an inebriated guest in the escorts' quarters, leading [[adventurer]]s to sometimes try and search them. The establishment denies the existence of such an item. However, some escorts had hired poor [[wizard]]s and [[cleric]]s to visit them in their rooms and try various [[spell]]s of detection in efforts to find it."
