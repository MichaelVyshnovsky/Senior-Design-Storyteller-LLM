        "mainbody": "'''Manyboughs''' was a wood-crafted mansion located within the [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]], ''circa'' [[1370 DR]]. Nestled on [[MacIntyre Path]], amongst a small grove of [[blueleaf]] trees, this home possessed an atmosphere and ambiance that lent to the residents the feeling they were living within a tree. In addition to its unique, natural atmosphere and decor, the manor of Manyboughs enjoyed a fantastic view of [[Fiddler's Green|the Green]] from its east-facing entrance. \n\nBuilt from magically enchanted wood, the structure of the Manyboughs house extended out as branches from one of three massive [[phandar]] trees. The limbs and boughs of the trees twisted up and around to form the sloped floors and walls and three-story manor. The water that flowed through this magical home was moved with [[magic]].",
        "History": "The [[druid]] adventurer [[Rowan Wilander]] called Manyboughs home during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
