        "mainbody": "Winter Winds was a quality clothing shop found in the city of Yartar. It was run by a pair of brothers, Felassal and Thuorn, who originated from the great metropolis of Baldurs Gate.\nThe owners were quite welcoming to returning customers, despite the argumentative attitude they took towards one another.\nThe shop offered fashionable clothes, with styles in stark contrast to the rugged lifestyle typically associated with the North. While their garments were voguish, the brothers prices were quite steep, typically 5 gp higher than other shops."
