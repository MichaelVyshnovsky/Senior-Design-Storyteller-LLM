The Arcanum of Magic, also known as the Great University, was a prominent university and temple dedicated to Thoth, a common combination among Thothian temples. 
The Arcanum was located in the northern part of Gheldaneth, adjacent to a wizards college available only to Thoths clergy.
The Arcanum was the largest building in all of Gheldaneth,
This university taught students of various ages how to count, read, and write. It also taught basic information on the Mulhorandi pantheon and the history of Mulhorand.
Operation of the Arcanum was conducted by the Scribes Guild.
Attending the Arcanum was compulsory for all citizens of Gheldaneth, even slaves. This occurred frequently during childhood and adults annually came to be retested. The most exemplary of students received invitations to join the Scribes Guild. In addition to students, the Arcanum was home to a secret order of Thoth worshiping archivists known as the Order of Ibis, which was founded following an excavation of a forgotten complex beneath the university.
