The Library of Tarchamus was a secret library hidden deep inside a mountain in ancient Netheril.
The library was located in the Nether Mountains on the northern edge of the High Forest a few days journey from what would later be Everlund in the Silver Marches. It was hidden deep inside a mountain, and accessing it required traversing a series of flooded caves known as Xammux. Deep within these caverns was the domed library sealed by large stone doors.
The library had three levels and was said to have housed over 100,000 volumes. The central level had a huge domed ceiling and was lit by mage lights. A total of 120 bookcases radiated out from the center of this level. The lower level contained a pit where Tarchamuss mummy resided, as well as air vents, which could be used as an escape route. Powerful wards were placed throughout the library to prevent scrying. There were also traps, although most were illusions.
Additionally, the Book of Tarchamus, which contained Tarchamuss consciousness, sat on a pedestal in the central area on the second level.
The library was built by the legendary arcanist Tarchamus the Unyielding both as a repository for his knowledge and as a trap for his Netherese rivals. Many Netherese arcanists fell victim to traps or Tarchamuss mummy while searching the library for his secrets.
The library was destroyed in Flamerule of the , by the warlock Farideh and her cambion master Lorcan and their allies in order to prevent Shadovar from gaining access to the librarys knowledge.
The library was inhabited by the ghosts of Tarchamuss apprentices as well as Tarchamuss mummy.
