Additionally, the complex offered secure rental-stall stables and coach storage, as well as short-term rental lodgings primarily used to conduct business in Baldur's Gate. Each of these lodgings included a bedroom chamber, a bathing chamber, and a \"trading chamber\" – spaced used for business meetings and negotiations. Guests received laundering and bathing services, as well as [[bread]] and water. Despite the lack of meals, guests were given access to oven facilities. Renting was priced at a single [[silver]] [[coin]] and an offering to Waukeen.\n\nAmong religious services, Manycoins House offered training to lay people and novice priests of Waukeen. Little advertised offerings included privacy of many undisclosed secret passages and discrete paid vaults for storing of small items of any nature."
