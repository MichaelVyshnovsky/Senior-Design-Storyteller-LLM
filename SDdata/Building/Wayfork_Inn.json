A single fireplace blazed on the opposite wall from the entrance and to the entrances left side stood a curved bar stand.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Wayfork Village was raided by the Red Fang marauder goblin gang, secretly allied with the Zhentarim. Hobgoblin Harnak the Butcher lead the assault and began slaughtering villages. He took a stand against a group of six adventurers inside the Wayfork Inn, where the scared townsfolk found shelter. Subsequently, the village was saved and Harnak – slain. The innkeeper at the time – Larani, a human woman, saw present during the attack but survived the experience. Despite the fact that adventurers saved the village, Larani the innkeeper disliked those who took to adventuring, believing them be rough and dangerous, but still welcome at the Wayfork Inn."
