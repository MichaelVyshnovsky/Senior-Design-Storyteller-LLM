        "mainbody": "ising Raven Inn was a lonesome inn located at the outside of the southeastern wall of Westgate.\nThe inn stood outside of the citys walls, near its south gate.\nThe Rising Raven Inn was usually packed with traders and adventurers, offering the standard services such as food, lodging, and more importantly a warm bath after the long road.\nNotably, the inn had a small private guest room, outside the main building, past the stable. The apartment was cramped but surprisingly clean. The room contained a stove, always filled with firewood and bunk beds. Upon request, the innkeeper sent young servant boys with a large copper bathtub, an ornate screen, buckets of water (more was accessible via a well nearby the apartment), and an oversized kettle to warm the bathwater.\nIn 1357 DR a hero sellsword Alias along with her companions Akabar Bel Akash, Dragonbait, and Olive Ruskettle briefly stayed at the inns private apartment. They barely had time to rest and clean up before Alias evil masters, led by Cassana, ambushed and captured the group."
