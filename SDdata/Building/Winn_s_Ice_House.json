        "mainbody": "inns Ice House was an icehouse business in the city of Ravens Bluff owned by the wizard Darra Winn.\nThis building was located on the corner of Black Visor Street and Flask Circle, in the Anvil neighborhood of the Crows End district.\nMuch like the businesss prior home, a series of cool subterannean caverns beneath the building were used for the storing of its ice.\nThis business created and stored ice through the use of spells, which it then sold. Most of this ice was cut during the winter season and stored in its underground caverns, packed compactly into casks specially made by a local cooper to be insulated with sawdust.Some exact prices and details of the operation of this store were not provided in The City of Ravens Bluff but, due to some similarities between it and Darra Winns previous store, this article assumes that Winns Ice House runs relatively the same as The Ice House.\nThe store made most of its profit by supplying ice to elite inns, restauraunts, noble households, and private clubs, and the offices maintained by the citys knightly orders. Having contracts with many of them to deliver ice to their doors each morning. Winns Ice House also provided ice in bulk to various fishmongers in the city. They delivered ice by means of wagons full of sawdust and hay.\nA side business of Winns Ice House during the hotter months was to sell flavored versions of its chipped ice, which had been chipped through use of the shatter spell. These cost two copper pieces, plus a three copper deposit for the returnable, earthenware cups and spoons they were served in. The treat was popular among both children and halflings in the city.\nFormerly belonging to an establishment known as Healthier Living, this building was bought and renamed by Darra Winn some time before 1370 DR after her previous shop, the Ice House, had burned to the ground and forced her to relocate.\nIn the 14 century DR, this establishment was run by Darra Winn and her three daughters.\nMuch like their prior establishment, Winns Ice House was the victim of some local rumors. In the case of this establishment, there were rumors that its underground caverns were occasionally used to keep cool things besides ice, such as bodies awaiting staged \"deaths.\""
