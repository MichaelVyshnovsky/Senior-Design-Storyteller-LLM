==Interior==
The two-floor tavern featured a rough pillar in the center that patrons attempted to climb, leaving a mark when they reached the top.

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], the tavern was located in the [[Money Quarter]], but by [[1485 DR]], the establishment was moved to the [[Caravan Quarter]], just within the town's [[Caravan Gate]].

==Ownership==
As of the [[1486 DR|Year of the Nether Mountain Scrolls, 1486 DR]], the owner of the tavern was a [[human]] woman named [[Glenys]], the great granddaughter of [[Darryl Orcslayer]]. She encouraged gambling in the tavern and even sponsored larger games each night.

==Notable Patrons==
The tavern was frequented by [[Curran Corvalin]], the [[halfling]] chosen of Tymora who sponsored filling ''[[Tymora's cup]]'', a ceremonial offering to the goddess should she want to stop by for a drink.
