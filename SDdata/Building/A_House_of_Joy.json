Both the town and shrine were situated within an isolated area of the [[Sunset Vale]], where the [[Dusk Road]] met the [[Uldoon Trail]].\n\nIt was one of several smaller shrines, including those to [[Morningstone House|Lathander]] and [[Goldcoin House|Waukeen]], built around the rundown yet still-running [[House of the Suffering God]], dedicated to [[Ilmater]]."
