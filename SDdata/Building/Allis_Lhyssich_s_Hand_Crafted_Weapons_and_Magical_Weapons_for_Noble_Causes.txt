Allis Lhyssichs Hand Crafted Weapons and Magical Weapons for Noble Causes was a specialist weapons store that also had standard gear for sale.
The shop was located close to the south gate of Neverwinter.
The master blacksmith, Allis Lhyssich, was one of the few smiths able to create magical weapons with meteorite ore. The crafting procedure took three days to make these highly enchanted meteorite weapons.
