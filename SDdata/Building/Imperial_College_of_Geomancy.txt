The '''Imperial College of Geomancy''' was the center of formal education for the study of [[geomancy]] in the ancient empire of [[Kadar]] in [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Students of the strange and powerful magic of geomancy learned their craft within this school. Attendees focused primarily on studying [[Elemental earth school|earth magic]] and learning to create powerful [[geoglyph]]s with [[arcane magic]] or [[divine magic]], or even by combining both forms of magic.
