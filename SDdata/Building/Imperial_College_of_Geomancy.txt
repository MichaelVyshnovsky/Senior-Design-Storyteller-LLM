The Imperial College of Geomancy was the center of formal education for the study of geomancy in the ancient empire of Kadar in Zakhara.
Students of the strange and powerful magic of geomancy learned their craft within this school. Attendees focused primarily on studying earth magic and learning to create powerful geoglyphs with arcane magic or divine magic, or even by combining both forms of magic.
