        "Description": "The Rutting Buck, which was located in the middle of Leilon, was seemingly always full of activity. The bustling tavern played loud music, and the patrons themselves were rowdy.",
        "History": "In [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]] arrived at the tavern to escort a group of ambassadors to [[Waterdeep]]. They were greeted by a soldier, who appeared to be Waterdhavian, and he announced their arrival to the patrons. After a while, the heroes and guards sat down to eat a meal of venison and hot [[bread]]. However, the food was drugged, and the heroes were captured and imprisoned."
