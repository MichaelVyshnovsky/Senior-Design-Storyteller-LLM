The '''Lamp of Learning''' was a [[magic]]al academy that operated in [[Baldur's Gate]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was located in the walled-off district of [[Little Calimshan]], in the Gate's impoverished [[Outer City]].

The school offered training for [[arcane spellcaster]]s, in the tradition of [[Calimshan]], a nation in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. They only admitted students of [[Calishite]] heritage or outsiders of exceptional skill and talent.
