The Lamp of Learning was a magical academy that operated in Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. It was located in the walled-off district of Little Calimshan, in the Gates impoverished Outer City.
The school offered training for arcane spellcasters, in the tradition of Calimshan, a nation in the Lands of Intrigue. They only admitted students of Calishite heritage or outsiders of exceptional skill and talent.
