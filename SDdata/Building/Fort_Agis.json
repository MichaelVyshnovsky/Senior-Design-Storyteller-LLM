Its walls were ten-to-fifteen-feet thick (3.0â€“4.6 meters) and 20 feet high (6.1 meters) with a deep, empty moat around them.\nDue to its proximity to one of Calimshans major cities and one of its most dangerous ruins, Fort Agis was defended with a greater complement of troops than its sister garrisons.
