'''Tantarn's Inn''' was an inn in the town of [[Llorkh]] in the 1360s [[DR]], owned by the experienced innkeeper [[Tantarn]].

==History==
It opened some time after the [[Zhentarim]] takeover of Llorkh in [[1357 DR]], less than a month after [[Worried Wyvern (Llorkh)|the only inn]] in town burned down after [[Phintarn's brother|its owner]] died. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly inns. Tantarn's Inn was in business by [[1366 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
It was a pleasant establishment, but three stories high and resembling a barn.
