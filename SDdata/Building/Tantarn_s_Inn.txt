Tantarns Inn was an inn in the town of Llorkh in the 1360s DR, owned by the experienced innkeeper Tantarn.
It opened some time after the Zhentarim takeover of Llorkh in 1357 DR, less than a month after the only inn in town burned down after its owner died. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly inns. Tantarns Inn was in business by 1366 DR and through 1370 DR.
It was a pleasant establishment, but three stories high and resembling a barn.
