Seawatch Tower was one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeeps Trollwall, located in the citys Sea Ward.Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of "torchtower."The sourcebook City System states that all torchtowers with names are "major towers".
This tower stood on Westwall Street, directly across from the western end of Grimwalds Way.
This tower stood five stories tall along the western wall of the Trollwall.
Being a torchtower, Seawatch Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.
