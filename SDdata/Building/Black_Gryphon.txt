The Black Gryphon was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the mid–14 century DR.
It was once managed by the sisters Allet and Vindara Tzuntzin, but their more monstrous clientele and visitors were unwelcome in Elturel. They sold the inn and moved to Waterdeep, opening the Misty Beard before the mid–1360s DR.
As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Black Gryphon was expressly an inn.
