The '''Black Gryphon''' was an inn in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

It was once managed by the sisters [[Allet Tzuntzin|Allet]] and [[Vindara Tzuntzin]], but their more monstrous clientele and visitors were unwelcome in Elturel. They sold the inn and moved to [[Waterdeep]], opening the [[Misty Beard]] before the mid–1360s DR.

As Lord [[Dhelt]] decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Black Gryphon was expressly an inn.
