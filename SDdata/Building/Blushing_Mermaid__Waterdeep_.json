        "mainbody": "The Blushing Mermaid was a tavern, inn, and festhall in Waterdeep managed by Lady Alathene Moonstar circa the . It was well-known for its luxurious atmosphere, privacy, and unique dining with merfolk servers.\nthumb|right|270px|The Blushing Mermaid (labeled D36) circa 1372 DR.\nThis establishment was located on Net Street in the Dock Ward, just one door up from Dock Street and its intersection with Keel Alley.\nthumb|right|270px|Map showing the Blushing Mermaid on Net Street, circa 1367 DR.\nThe Blushing Mermaid was a converted villa that consisted of three two- and three-story connected buildings. The lowest level was connected to a series of well-secured secret tunnels once used for smuggling. The merfolk staff used these to commute to work, swimming in from the harbor and exiting the same way when their shift was over.\nThe rooms were luxuriously appointed and each one was a suite composed of a reception area that could also be an office, a private bedroom, and a private bathroom. The common areas were partitioned with thin curtains and had many cushions for comfortable lounging. The carpets were thick and sound-absorbent. The main attraction was a large heated pool filled with scented water where guests could soak while being served food and drink by mermaids and mermen.\nIt was a well-known fact that the Blushing Mermaid was riddled with secret passages. Nearly every room had a sliding panel in the wall, but they were spell-locked so only Lady Alathene or a trusted staff member carrying one of four enchanted silver hands could operate them. Guests seldom if ever managed to circumvent Lady Alathenes spells.\nThe Blushing Mermaid was a refuge from the loud and noisome harbor. Many hanging lamps gave off pleasant scents and warm amber glows. The plush carpets and gauzy curtains made cozy nooks for socializing between guests and escorts. All the waitstaff, maids, and escorts (and even Lady Alathene herself\nAs of 1367 DR, a typical room at the Blushing Mermaid rented for 5 gold pieces per night, but the rate varied by size and the distance from the ground floor, ranging from 3 gp for a small upper room to 9 gp for a large room lower down. The tenday rate was anywhere from 10 to 50 gp, but a typical room was 20 gp. For this price, the scents in the room were adjusted to the renters choice, fresh linens were provided for the asking, and a seemingly unlimited supply of clean, scented bath water was available.\nThe kitchens specialized in seafood and whole roast pig. Volothamp Geddarm, the author of many guidebooks, noted that the food was too lightly seasoned for his taste and fairly expensive. A meal ran 1 to 3 gp per person and did not include a drink. Beer could be had for 2 copper pieces per tankard, zzar was 1 silver piece per glass, and wine from the extensive cellar ranged from 1 to 22 gp a bottle.\nThe service at the Blushing Mermaid was excellent. The staff received a percentage of the profits and often gave guests personal attention. Tipping was a common practice here, and individuals got to keep their tips. Some regular customers gave the establishment extra funds (a gold piece per day was typical) and asked that it be shared with all the staff members.\nthumb|right|270px|Lady Alathene atop her bone-covered spiral staircase.\nThe Blushing Mermaid was known for its \"Hour of Darkness\" when all lights in the common rooms and hallways were extinguished, requiring guests who were still up and about to navigate by feeling their way around. Many pranks, a few frights, and much laughter ensued. This occurred every night in the early morning hours and the only source of illumination outside of private rooms was the soft blue-silver glow given off by the enchanted hands carried by certain staff members.\nThe flammable fixtures and furnishings were all protected from fire, magical or mundane, by powerful and expensive enchantments.\nLady Alathene Moonstar was an archlich masquerading as an elderly human matron that maintained her beauty by magic. Few outside of her family and the Lords of Waterdeep knew her secret. She was a wizard of great accomplishment even before she transformed herself and did not fear the occasional drunken mage or anything else. She did not hesitate to defend her staff and her home with all the spells and magic at her command.\nThe Blushing Mermaid was originally a villa owned by the Moonstar family. In the , the Moonstar clan joined the growing number of nobility that were constructing bigger and more unique domiciles north of the city. They retained ownership of their first villa through proxies and turned it into an inn, tavern, and festhall under the proprietorship of Lady Alathene.\nMany stories revolved around a gentleman falling in love with one of the mermaids (or vice versa) and them having to seek out magical assistance in order to live together, either on land or under the waves.\nThe bone-covered circular staircase in the main dining hall engendered many rumors about guests disappearing and never seen again. These stories had their basis in fact. Lady Alathenes continued existence depended on her using energy drain on two or three people every year. She always chose those whom she judged to be evil (or she strongly disliked), and the Lords of Waterdeep tolerated her survival technique because she occasionally reported details of criminal plots and illegal deals to them.\nIn addition to the staff of over twenty maids, these individuals were known to frequent the Blushing Mermaid\n* Lady Alathene Moonstar Proprietress since the midâ€“13 century DR.\n* Reetha Staff that provided security.\n* Leilatha Subraira Staff that provided security.\n* Bensyl Iyrivvin A Harper agent that worked as an escort.\n* Felibarr Blacklance A bounty hunter and assassin who frequented the bar."
