        "mainbody": "The '''House of Hope''' was a temple to [[Tymora]] the Luckbringer found in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The House of Hope lay on the north side of the Market in the center of Tantras.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the deity [[Torm]] resided at [[Temple of Torm's Coming|his temple]] in Tantras. Torm's zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths as \"unbelievers\", and the unlucky House of Hope was left with a dearth of material and spiritual resources.\n\nNevertheless, the House of Hope remained active through to [[1367 DR]] and past [[1370 DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the temple was led by High Priestess [[Lashaera Thindol]], with five priests and eight lay-followers."
