Torms zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths as \"unbelievers\", and the unlucky House of Hope was left with a dearth of material and spiritual resources.\nNevertheless, the House of Hope remained active through to 1367 DR and past 1370 DR.\nCirca 1358 DR, the temple was led by High Priestess Lashaera Thindol, with five priests and eight lay-followers."
