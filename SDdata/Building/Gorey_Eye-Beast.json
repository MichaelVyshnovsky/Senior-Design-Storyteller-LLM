        "mainbody": "The '''Gorey Eye-Beast''' was a rough tavern located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.",
        "Location": "The tavern was located within Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] in the southeast section of the city at the intersection of [[Beholder Street]] and [[Moonsea Avenue]].",
        "Description": "The sign hanging outside of the tavern depicted an [[eye tyrant]] whose fangs were dripping blood.",
        "Inhabitants": "The mispelling of \"gory\" in the tavern's name served as an accurate preview of the crude clientele found within. The Gorey Eye-Beast catered mostly to wicked [[humanoid]]s such as [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[hobgoblin]]s. Any [[human]]s or [[demihuman]]s entering the tavern were met by a half dozen ogres armed with [[club]]s. Anyone skilled enough to make it past the ogre bouncers were allowed to stay, though they were watched carefully."
