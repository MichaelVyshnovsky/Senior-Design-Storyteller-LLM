        "mainbody": "The Gorey Eye-Beast was a rough tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.\nThe tavern was located within Zhentil Keeps Common Quarter in the southeast section of the city at the intersection of Beholder Street and Moonsea Avenue.\nThe sign hanging outside of the tavern depicted an eye tyrant whose fangs were dripping blood.\nThe mispelling of \"gory\" in the taverns name served as an accurate preview of the crude clientele found within. The Gorey Eye-Beast catered mostly to wicked humanoids such as orcs, ogres, and hobgoblins. Any humans or demihumans entering the tavern were met by a half dozen ogres armed with clubs. Anyone skilled enough to make it past the ogre bouncers were allowed to stay, though they were watched carefully."
