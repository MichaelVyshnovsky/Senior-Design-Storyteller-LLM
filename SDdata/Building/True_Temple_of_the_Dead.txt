The '''True Temple of the Dead''' was a holy house devoted to the deity [[Kelemvor]], found in the public graveyard of [[Ravens Bluff]], located just east of the city proper, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Rather than a typical place of worship, the True Temple was erected to protect the citizens of Ravens Bluff from any possible [[undead]] threats that may have emerged from the surrounding graves. 

==History==
The temple came into existence in a very unusual manner. Shortly after the funeral services for [[Belanor Fenmarel]], the Deputy Mayor of the Bluff, the grounds of the graveyard began to tremble and the temple emerged from the ground, an obsidian monolith that shone in the moonlight. When all was settled, the [[priest]] [[Damien Rethart]] emerged from the building's front doors and introduced himself to those holding vigil for the deceased deputy mayor. He claimed to be the representative of Kelemvor to all the Ravenian citizens and let it be known that the True Temple of the Dead was the rightful resting place for all the city's souls.

==Inhabitants==
This temple was guarded by two [[minor death]]s, garbed in [[cloak]]s and cowls.
