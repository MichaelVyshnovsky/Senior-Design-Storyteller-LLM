        "Location": "It lay under the rocky hills that overlooked [[Raven Cliff Beach]] and was not far from the [[High Road]], just north of Neverwinter.The name \"barrow\" suggests some of these hills are artificial, being a burial mound or [[Wikipedia:tumulus|tumulus]].",
        "Entrance": "[[File:NW Cragmire Barrow sword.jpg|thumb|right|''The sword in the gate.'']]\nThick stone slabs and pillars roughly built of stone bricks framed the entrance of a tunnel into the hill, with a wrought-[[iron]] gate across it. This was flanked by a pair of statues of death. Curiously, an ornate [[sword]] of disturbing aspect was seen jammed into the gate by 1479 DR; whether it was for the making of a magical seal or the breaking of one is unknown. On the other side, a lump of red wax and a shield seemed to form the seal itself.\n\nBefore the gates stood another statue, this one with a faded inscription at its base identifying the occupants and the reason for their downfall. At some point, it's head had been knocked off. A simpler yet more emphatic message stood further in front and to the left of this: a few skulls mounted on stakes jammed into the earth as a clear warning of the undeath and danger within.",
        "Interior": "[[File:NW Cragmire Barrow interior.jpg|thumb|right|''A sarcophagus and brazier inside the crypt.'']]\nThe first level was a crypt built of stone bricks, with thick pillars supporting vaulted ceilings.  Lighting was provided by a number of [[brazier]]s. A short corridor stretched ahead into the hill, with a series of alcoves leading off of it and some separated by iron gates. Within these alcoves were ornate sarcophagi.\n\nAt the end to the left was a gate and staircase leading down to the so-called Forgotten Vault. This was a strange space of stone pillars and arches and portcullises forming circular chambers, all within a black void—whether a cavern or a pocket [[plane]] is unknown. In any case, this was where the mage Olandus Cragmire stored his most treasured [[artifact]]s, in a sealed casket within one of these chambers. These were a magical copy of ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', a philter of the ''[[waters of Elah'zad]]'', and a ''[[lantern of revelation]]''.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:NW battle wights.jpg|thumb|right|''Two wights do make a wrong.'']]\nThe first level was occupied by restless [[skeleton]] warriors and rotting [[zombie]]s, and a pair of battle [[wight]]s.\n\nThe second level contained more undead and guardian [[golem]]s, including a [[magma golem]] and a [[bone golem]], as well as the [[lich]] [[Olandus Cragmire]] himself.",
        "History": "Although the Cragmire family were allied with Neverwinter's royal family, its members had formed a [[necromantic]] cult that schemed to take over Neverwinter and all the [[Sword Coast]]. They even raised an [[undead]] army.\n\nHowever, before they could see their plan come to fruition, the family's secret was revealed in the {{YearlinkName|1328}}, and the leaders of Neverwinter took immediate action. They dispatched the Neverwintan army to assault Cragmire Keep; it was largely destroyed and every last member of the cult killed. The Cragmire family line was ended that day. However, the undead-filled barrow and crypt was a far deadlier challenge. Soldiers and priests ventured inside to battle or purify them, but few came back, at least alive. Unwilling to lose more lives clearing them out, the Neverwintan leaders chose to have the barrow and crypt sealed by powerful [[magic]]al enchantments, and trap the horde of undead that remained within.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Here lie the last of the once-noble House of Cragmire, brought low by their own meddling in the dark and necromantic arts, 1328 DR, Year of the Adder.\n| source = The inscription placed outside Cragmire Barrow\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = text-align:center;\n}}\nThe barrow and crypt remained untouched for one hundred and fifty years, but the seals were gravely weakened in the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]].
