The portal lead to a endless maze of underground caverns. The Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters were paid to light the caverns.\nThe dead of Waterdeep were interred within the House of the Homeless if they died without laying claim, or payment, to any other burial site. Their names, if known at the time of death, were carved into the stone above the hole where their cremated ashes were laid to rest."
