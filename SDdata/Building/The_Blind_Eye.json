        "mainbody": "The Blind Eye was a tack and harness shop located just outside of the city walls of Westgate in 1367 DR.\nThe shop was located outside of Westgates West Gate by the Cormaeril yards.\nThe Blind Eyes sold tack and harness and trail goods. This was actually a front as the shops owner was a fence for stolen goods. The location of the Blind Eye outside of the city walls granted it exemption from regulations that would have otherwise been imposed within the city. Nonetheless, the Croamarkhs agents kept a close eye on the shops activities."
