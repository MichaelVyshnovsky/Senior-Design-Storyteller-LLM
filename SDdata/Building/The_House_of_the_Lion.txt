The House of the Lion was luxurious festhall and the namesake of the moot on which it stood in the city of Baldurs Gate.
The House of the Lion stood on the eastern side of Lionsmoot, one of three major moots in Baldurs Gate, just southeast of the Watch Citadel.In Candlekeeps answers provided by Ed Greenwood, it was said that Lionsmoot was located at the beginning of Stormcanter Street before it crossed the city. However, that seems to not be possible as no unnamed street fits its description. This seems to be a naming error as the author meant to name Windspell Street instead, or Stormshore Street, which was said to cross the city, but the introduction of the 5th edition maps and Old Walls made it impossible.
By the mid 14 century DR, the House of the Lion had become a popular social club frequented by young Baldurian "blades" (young wealthy men of status and coin) and "lacethroats" (socially bold young women of status, fashion, and wealth). The noble youths spent nights at the festhall socializing, coupling, gambling, imbibing, and dueling late into the night. The festhall was guarded by "waycudgels" who ended any rowdiness or troublemaking, sending youths to commit debauchery elsewhere.
