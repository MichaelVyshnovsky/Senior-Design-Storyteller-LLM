The House of Purple Silks was a notable festhall in Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was a very famous pleasure palace of the Sword Coast.
The House of Purple Silks was located in the Sea Ward, on the west side of Seawatch Street and one blood south of the corner with Diamond Street.
The ladies working at the festhall were known for wearing purple silks. Inside, its floors were covered in carpets and filled with cushions. Its guests were bold but met by bolder women.
It was rumored that illicit goods were concealed under the carpet in some areas and even within a few of the cushions.
The proprietress was a petite woman in her forties named Jathaliira Thindrel. She was pert and always busy and still energetic and attractive.
