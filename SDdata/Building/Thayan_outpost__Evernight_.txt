The '''Thayan outpost''' in [[Evernight]], also known as Evernight's '''Thayan Enclave''', was a base from which agents of [[Thay]] were able to make their presence felt within that city. The outpost also overlooked and maintained a [[shadow crossing]] from which Thayan agents could arrive in the [[Shadowfell]] from [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Neverdeath]] graveyard on the [[Material Plane]].

==Location==
It was located south of the river of lava that flowed through Evernight and was not far from the [[Haunted Pier]] and the [[Deaders Market]]. It was within sight of the small hill on which the [[Shadow crossing (Evernight)|portal from Neverdeath]] was located.

==Structure==
The outpost was located within a warehouse that was blackened from fire damage.

==Activities==
The outpost served as a headquarters for Thayan interests in Evernight, particularly in managing the portal, overseeing traffic along the [[Shadowfell Road]] (and paying the city for the privilege of using it, generally in the form of living victims for the [[undead]] citizen to consume), and keeping an eye on things in the Shadowfell. In particular, the outpost attempted to identify spies working for [[Netheril]], such as those operating out of the [[dark creeper enclave]].

==History==
This outpost was not the Thayans' primary headquarters in the [[Sword Coast North]] at the time of its operation. Thayan machinations in the area were led by [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], who also maintained larger bases in the [[Neverneath]] and at the [[Dread Ring (Neverwinter Wood)|Dread Ring]] in [[Neverwinter Wood]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, notable Thayans at the outpost included:
* [[Katrice Ansar]], who oversaw the outpost and served Valindra Shadowmantle. Her primary concern was rooting out suspected but unseen agents of Netheril.
* [[Myros]], a powerful [[Red Wizard]] who schemed to undermine the [[shadovar]] in Evernight.
