The '''Glory of the Morning''', also known as the '''Gloryhouse''', was a rebuilt temple dedicated to the Morninglord [[Lathander]] found in [[Archenbridge]] during the 14{{Th}} century [[DR]]. It was considered one of the more popular and wealthy temples in all the [[Dalelands|Dales]], and even [[Sembia]] to the southeast.

==Structure==
Shortly before [[1369 DR]], the temple was renovated to store more of the [[Church of Lathander|church's]] wealth and its fa√ßade was beautifully restored in white [[granite]].

It featured a tall, central spire with a large brazier that provided illumination far and wide. The Lathanderian clergy would add ground substances to the fire on holy occasions and celebrations to form pink smoke that rose into the sky.

==Interior==
The temple featured an in-house workshop that could be used by any Lathanderian at no cost, or by others for the price of 5 [[gp]] per day.

==Staff==
The Glory of the Morning was overseen by Light of Lathander, Mornmaster [[Stellaga Brightstar]]. She was assisted in her duties by Hand of Lathander, [[Morninglord|High Morninglord]] [[Orblin Storntar]], the 'four ladies' Dawnmasters [[Alguuna]], [[Rassauva]], [[Shirrye]], and [[Tosstra]],

==Services==
Clergy members were well-known for offering advice to local Lathanderian faithful regarding mechanical devices or the likely success of new business ventures undertaken within Sembia or the surrounding [[Dalelands]]. The temple's priests could be hired to assist with these endeavors, though they would immediately be recalled when given the opportunity to take on more adventurous or dangerous tasks.

While the temple's leaders seldom offered loans to most aspiring businesspeople, it was more inclined to back projects led by Lathanderian inventors and entrepreneurs.

==Defenses==
Because [[wyvern]]s would often "investigate" the tower, out of sheer curiosity, several guardsmen equipped with powerful magic were stationed atop the temple's spire.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the efforts of High Morninglord Brightstar and her clergy had greatly enriched the lives of Archenbridge's residents. The town had garnered much wealth and attracted craftspeople that would not normally visit such a rustic, and out-of-the-way town.
