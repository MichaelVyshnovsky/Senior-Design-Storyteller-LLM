The '''Barge House''' was a large tavern found in [[Daleport]] in [[1357 DR]].

==Description==
Converted from an old warehouse, the Barge House was massive, easily holding 500 occupants at one time.

==Activities==
Most of the inhabitants of the small town of Daleport could be found socializing at the Barge House each night. Given the number of smugglers passing through the region, many rare or illegal goods could be purchased here for the right price.
