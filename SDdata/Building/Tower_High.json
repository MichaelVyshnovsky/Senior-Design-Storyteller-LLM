The Tower High stood eight storys tall and included some subterranean sections as well.\nManshoon held select meetings within the Tower High for both the Council of Lords and the inner circle of the Zhentarim within a secret chamber.\nLiving gargoyles clung to the rafters of the Towers main hall. Six stone golems were situated in various locations within the Tower. Powerful guards and wards spells protected every room of the Tower High.\nOrlgaun, Manshoons personal black dragon, lived within a lair beneath the Tower High. Large stone doors in the courtyard of the compound could be opened to release Orlgaun when needed. Manshoon also stored several of his stasis clones in a special laboratory found beneath the Tower."
