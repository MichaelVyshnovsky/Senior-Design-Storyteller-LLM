Temple of Tymora was a humble shrine dedicated to The Lady Who Smiles, Tymora, in the town of Skull Crag in the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr.
The Temple of Tymora was located on the northern side of town.
The building was the place that performed Skull Crags religious services, granted access to divine magic, and offered healing to travelers and adventurers.
In the mid-14 century DR, the Temple of Tymora was the only place of healing in Skull Crag, apart from the Chapel of Sune located in the Skull Crag Keep.
