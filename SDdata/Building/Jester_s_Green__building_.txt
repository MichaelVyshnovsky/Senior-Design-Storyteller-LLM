'''Jester's Green''' was an [[inn]] and the namesake of a small [[Jester's Green (town)|town]] located just north of [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]].

==History==
Sadly, the inn was destroyed long ago in a fire when the innkeep cheated a traveling [[Red Wizard of Thay]] who launched a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' at him. The innkeep perished along with his establishment.
