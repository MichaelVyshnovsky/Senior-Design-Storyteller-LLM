It was noteworthy in for being made entirely of stone and, of course, being extremely welcoming to [[dwarves]].\n\nThe cryptic name of the inn referenced the \"deep mine\", an entrance to the [[Underdark]] also found within the village. This entrance was shrouded in secrecy and unknown to the larger community of Mistrans throughout the dale,"
