        "Description": "The ''Statue of Kisonraathiisar'' stood on the [[Harbor Loop]] of Westgate, on the street's western side, in the Loop's inner block. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the statue could be found to the southwest of [[Okuzo's Imports]] shop. The masterfully sculpted statue mistakingly depicted the wyrm as a [[red dragon]], but, despite that, was impressive. Of course, it was not built to scale. Benches were placed on the sides of the dragon statue, two on each side."
