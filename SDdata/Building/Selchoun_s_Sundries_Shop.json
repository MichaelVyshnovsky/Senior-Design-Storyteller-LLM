        "mainbody": "'''Selchoun's Sundries Shop''' was a prosperous general store located in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.",
        "Location": "[[File:Selchoun's Sundries Shop.png|thumb|right|270px|''The original location, ''circa'' 1367 DR.'']]\nSelchoun's Sundries was first established in the Sea Ward sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, and prominently stood on the point of land formed by the intersections of [[Feather Street]] and [[Diamond Street]] with [[Delzorin Street]]. This choice location was across Diamond Street from the [[Cassalanter]] family villa, across Delzorin Street from the sprawling [[Eirontalar Villa]], and across Feather Street from the [[Dezlentyr]] family compound.\n\n[[File:CoS-Selchoun's Sundries.png|thumb|right|270px|''The newer location (labeled <code>3</code> ''circa'' 1367 DR.'']]\nUnfortunately, the shop burned down in a mysterious fire sometime in late [[1367 DR]] but reopened at a new location a few blocks north, on [[Staghunter's Way]],",
        "Structure": "The building on Staghunter's Way was two stories tall and looked like a respectable business. It was L-shaped with the larger wing extending into the interior of the city block.",
        "Services": "Selchoun's Sundries sold [[toy]]s and tourist treasure—small wooden [[shield]]s that commemorated a child's visit to Waterdeep, child-sized [[tabard]]s with whimsical slogans, and so on—but also carried everyday necessities like [[flint]], [[kindling]], [[twine]], [[string]], leather thongs, [[clay pipe]]s, [[carrysack]]s, ''etc.''",
        "History": "Osbrin Selchoun started his shop at the Feather Street location sometime prior to 1357 DR. The building was consumed in a mysterious blaze in late 1367 DR and Osbrin was forced to relocate. He chose a fine-looking building on Staghunter's Way not far from Heroes' Garden and quickly got his business up and running again.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The building on Staghunter's Way occupied the same location as the former stables of the ill-fated [[Deepwinter (family)|Deepwinter]] noble family. They all perished in various acts of treachery during the [[Guildwars]] of the mid–13{{th}} century DR, with some of them murdered in the stables. Their [[ghost]]s manifested as spots of cold or motes of fear that meandered through the shop, although not usually during business hours. Occasionally, customers would encounter one of these apparitions and the brave ones would demand a discount for their discomfort.{{Cite web/Realms by Night/Part Seven: Kahla the Ghost of Heroes' Garden}}"
