The Mythallar Housing was the complex that contained the twin mythallars of the Eileanar enclave.
The Housing was found near the center of the enclave, close to the University of Definitive Archwizardry.
The mythallars were surrounded by a metal cage-like building that allowed their glow to be seen from outside. Mirrors were placed above the enclosure and reflected stray upward-flowing magical energy down and back into the enclave so that it wouldnt be wasted.
The enclave was one of the first enclaves to have two separate mythallars sustaining it. One mythallar was used for powering the many quasimagical items in the enclave, while the other powered all the other magical effects that allowed for the enclaves gravity-defying architecture and high standards of luxury.
The Housing was overseen by Karsuss trusted assistants, Dewez, Haym, and Salix, who each took different work shifts. They were then assisted by Cowper whenever necessary.
Formal execution via contact with the mythallar was a known, though extreme punishment in the enclave. While other lethal executions often came with the allowance that the criminal could be resurrected after a period of decades or centuries, destruction via mythallar was so complete that resurrection was impossible.
One notable execution via mythallar was around , that of Lord High Justice Andoris Derathars son, Jelal Derathar, who was charged with the murder of an arcanists familiar. So confident in his innocence and the love of his father, Jelal daringly chose the mythallar over other potential means of execution that would have allowed his resurrection. Unfortunately for Jelal, his father came to a harsh, if legally correct ruling of guilt, and had his own son ruthlessly destroyed.
Following the discovery in  of the shadow mythallars created by the Shadow Consortium, those constructs also became used for legal executions, starting with the guilty Shiris Blamira.
Karsus almost destroyed the enclave in  when he created an enormous blob of heavy magic and imbued it with Volhms drain. The heavy magic mass pulled energy from the mythallar and then cycled it back, meaning that all available magical energy was en route between the two points, but never available to the many dependent items and effects within the enclave, including its method of flight. As the city began to fall from the sky, Karsus used levitation and Tolodines gust of wind to quickly toss the blob overboard and made it someone elses problem. The heavy magic blob was sent flying away into the High Forest where it struck the arcanist Wulgreth, killed him, and then turned him into a lich. The mythallar escaped unharmed.
At one point, Karsus developed a plan to install magic-reflecting mirrors all around the edge of the enclave so that even more unused energy could be reflected back into the mythallars, creating a standing wave of magical energy that would exponentially increase the efficiency and power available. Before he could put it into action, the sage Eugenius explained that such a course of action could very possibly annihilate the entire enclave in the Realms largest fireworks display. Karsus decided against his plan and put it to rest.
