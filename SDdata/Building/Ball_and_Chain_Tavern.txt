The Ball and Chain Tavern was a drinking establishment that operated in the docks of the Wheloon Prison in the late 15 century DR.

The lower wall of the building was built of cobbled stones, then the upper structure was half-timbered and plastered, with many windows elevated well above the ground level. Inside, the tavern had a single large high-ceilinged taproom, with the windows casting light into it from above. The tavern also had a garret upstairs that was used for private meetings, and extra tables out front for those who preferred to drink under the open sky.

The tavern was set up by Trosken Adze and his wife Alda after the establishment of the prison, and it remained the only drinking hole in the docks. It mainly served the Purple Dragons, War Wizards, magistrates, dockworkers, and other visitors who came to the dismal harbor, and was essentially the only place that they could relax and get away from the horrors of the prison, if only for a little while.
