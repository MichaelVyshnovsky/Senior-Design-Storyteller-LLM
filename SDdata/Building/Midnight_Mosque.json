        "mainbody": "The Midnight Mosque was a mosque dedicated to Hajama in Liham, in 1367 DR.\nThe Midnight Mosque had a splendid view over Al-Sari River. A single narrow trail was the only way into the mosque.\nThis mosque was made from black granite, providing ample shielding from Zakharas punishing heat. \nThe interior of the mosque was decorated with basalt statues that drew visitors. Black marble inlaid with onyx and black jade covered the floor.\nThe vast majority of priests worshiping here were ethoists. A few pragmatists gained the beneficial attention of the caliph."
