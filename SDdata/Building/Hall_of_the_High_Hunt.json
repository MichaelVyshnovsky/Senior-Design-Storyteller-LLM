        "mainbody": "The '''Hall of the High Hunt''' was a temple of [[Solonor Thelandira]] in [[Evereska]].",
        "Geography": "It was built into the western slope of [[Moondark Hill]].",
        "Structure": "The beauteous temple was built as an open-air pavilion set within a circle of elder [[shadowtop]] trees.\n\nAt the center of the hall was the 'Singing Spring of Solonor Thelandira', a fountain of silver waters formed from a mountain spring originating beneath Moondark Hill and meandering through several natural caverns before reaching the surface.. The air in and around the temple held the lingering scent of sweetwater.",
        "Activities": "In addition to its role in the service of Solonor, the Hall of the High Hunt served as the meeting place for Evereska's [[Hill Elders]], the council of senior [[elves]] that oversaw their city's protection and guided its citizens.\n\nDue to the restorative properties of the water that arose from the 'Singing Spring', the temple became a place of healing for Evereskan elves that became injured or ill.",
        "Inhabitants": "While they were there, the priests of Solonor live in caves within Moondark Hill, amongst their various hunting trophies. Their leader around [[1370 DR]] was the aged [[moon elf]] High Huntsman [[Pleufan Trueshot]]. He invited [[half-elves]] and [[human]]s, all faithful of Solonor and many of them [[Harpers]] and [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]], to visit the Hall of the High Hunt and venerate Solonor at any time. Many of the moon elf nobility were so shocked by this they relocated their estates to the other side of the valley."
