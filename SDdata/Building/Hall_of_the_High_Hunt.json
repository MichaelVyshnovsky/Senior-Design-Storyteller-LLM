        "mainbody": "he Hall of the High Hunt was a temple of Solonor Thelandira in Evereska.\nIt was built into the western slope of Moondark Hill.\nThe beauteous temple was built as an open-air pavilion set within a circle of elder shadowtop trees.\nAt the center of the hall was the Singing Spring of Solonor Thelandira, a fountain of silver waters formed from a mountain spring originating beneath Moondark Hill and meandering through several natural caverns before reaching the surface.. The air in and around the temple held the lingering scent of sweetwater.\nIn addition to its role in the service of Solonor, the Hall of the High Hunt served as the meeting place for Evereskas Hill Elders, the council of senior elves that oversaw their citys protection and guided its citizens.\nDue to the restorative properties of the water that arose from the Singing Spring, the temple became a place of healing for Evereskan elves that became injured or ill.\nWhile they were there, the priests of Solonor live in caves within Moondark Hill, amongst their various hunting trophies. Their leader around 1370 DR was the aged moon elf High Huntsman Pleufan Trueshot. He invited half-elves and humans, all faithful of Solonor and many of them Harpers and Heralds of Faer√ªn, to visit the Hall of the High Hunt and venerate Solonor at any time. Many of the moon elf nobility were so shocked by this they relocated their estates to the other side of the valley."
