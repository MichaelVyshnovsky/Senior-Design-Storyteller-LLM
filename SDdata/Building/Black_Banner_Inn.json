        "Location": "This building was located on the west side of Daerlun near the Sunset Gate. Its main entrance was on the north side of the [[Street of the Dragon]] which connected the gate to the [[Westmarket]] and beyond.",

            "Atmosphere": "The lighting was muted throughout most of the establishment, making it fairly private but gloomy. Community dining and revelry was discouraged&mdash;guests were almost exclusively served food and drink in their rooms."

        "Services": "The only exception was the grand lounge where businessfolk could meet and gambling tables were available. There, the clientele could enjoy fine vintages from the well-stocked wine cellar."
