        "mainbody": "'''Three Flags Sailing''' was a tavern in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It stood near the docks, at the center of town.",
        "Atmosphere": "It was a quiet, relaxed sort of place, catering as it did to fisherfolk after a long hard day's work, who wanted only dinner and a drink before heading home, not talk and revelry. It was especially subdued during [[Auril]]'s unending winter in [[1488 DR]] and [[1489 DR]]. Nevertheless, when they celebrated an especially good catch or had had a clash with their rivals from [[Termalaine]] or told the story of a past one, the atmosphere could become more boisterous.",
        "Services": "It typically served a bowl of [[stew]] and a pint of [[beer]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the 1480s DR, \"Ma\" [[Ethen Yarbroul]] ran the tavern like an old mother, fussing over the fisherfolk patrons as if they were own sons (and some were) and encouraging them to have a hot [[beer]] \"to take the chill off\"."
