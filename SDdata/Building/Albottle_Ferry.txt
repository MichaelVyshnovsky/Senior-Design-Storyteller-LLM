Albottle Ferry was a busy ferry crossing for the River Ashaba in the village of Wrights Ferry in Featherdale.
A team of large draft horses moved the ferry by means of ropes suspended over a timber frame.
The price to use the ferry was 7 sp per person which included a single mount plus another 3 sp for every additional pack animal. A wagon could be transported for 2 gp. The ferry was run by Dregan and Flender Albottle. Should a customer become unruly about the fares the brothers would call on their cousin Auglaer who was a massive man who appeared to have ogre blood in his veins.
