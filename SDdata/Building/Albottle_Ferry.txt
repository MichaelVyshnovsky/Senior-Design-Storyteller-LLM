'''Albottle Ferry''' was a busy ferry crossing for the [[River Ashaba]] in the village of [[Wright's Ferry]] in [[Featherdale]].

==Description==
A team of large draft [[horse]]s moved the ferry by means of ropes suspended over a timber frame.

==Activities==
The price to use the ferry was 7 [[sp]] per person which included a single mount plus another 3 [[sp]] for every additional pack animal. A wagon could be transported for 2 [[gp]]. The ferry was run by [[Dregon Albottle|Dregan]] and [[Flender Albottle]]. Should a customer become unruly about the fares the brothers would call on their cousin [[Auglaer]] who was a massive man who appeared to have [[ogre]] blood in his veins.
