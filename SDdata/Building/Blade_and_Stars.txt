The Blade and Stars was an inn in Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast of Faer√ªn.

The rooms were tidy and clean. The front lobby hosted a small lounge where guests could meet citizens. Outside, the inn sign displayed a female hand clutching a lightly curved saber and several enchanted stars that twinkled softly. It was rumored the sign was plundered and purchased years ago from a raiding party in Amn.
The inn was fairly quiet and sold drinks at moderate prices. Meals were served in guests rooms rather than a dining room and consisted of regular ale, bread, and fish. The bread could be ordered with cheese or melted eggs. On winter nights, the staff served ruby cordial, a sweet brew of cherries dissolved in sugared red wine.
The innkeeper, Aundegul Shawn, hired several guards to turn away street rogues and thugs from entering the establishment. They were especially on the lookout for doppelgangers, which posed a growing problem in Baldurs Gate around 1367 DR.
About a century later, the Blade and Stars was run by the half-orc Aurayaun. After her sudden disappearance, it was taken over by her wife Lupin.
Local legend stated a female yuan-ti was trapped within the inns walls, imprisoned while fighting a wizard. Rumors said she would finally be released upon his death.

At some point during the 15 century DR, the magical sign of the Blade and Stars was stolen. One Baldurian begger claimed that the thief was Aurayaun, the former innkeeper who had just recently gone missing.
