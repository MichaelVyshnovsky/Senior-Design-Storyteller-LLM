The '''Blade and Stars''' was an inn in [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]] of [[Faerûn]]. 

==Structure==
[[File:AR1300.png|thumb|left|''The Blade and Stars.'']]The long building was four stories high with an attached stable. The kitchens were on one side and the upper-room balconies were on the other. The rooms were tidy and clean. The front lobby hosted a small lounge where guests could meet citizens. Outside, the inn sign displayed a female hand clutching a lightly curved saber and several enchanted stars that twinkled softly. It was rumored the sign was plundered and purchased years ago from a raiding party in [[Amn]].

==Atmosphere==
The inn was fairly quiet and sold drinks at moderate prices. Meals were served in guests' rooms rather than a dining room and consisted of regular ale, bread, and fish. The bread could be ordered with cheese or melted eggs. On winter nights, the staff served ruby cordial, a sweet brew of cherries dissolved in sugared red [[wine]].

==Staff== 
The innkeeper, [[Aundegul Shawn]], hired several guards to turn away street [[rogue]]s and thugs from entering the establishment. They were especially on the lookout for [[doppelganger]]s, which posed a growing problem in Baldur's Gate around [[1367 DR]].

About a century later, the Blade and Stars was run by the [[half-orc]] [[Aurayaun]]. After her sudden disappearance, it was taken over by her wife [[Lupin]].

==Rumors==
Local legend stated a female [[yuan-ti]] was trapped within the inn's walls, imprisoned while fighting a [[wizard]]. Rumors said she would finally be released upon his death.

==Prices==
* Rooms (included bath, stabling, one free drink, and meals) for 3 [[gp]] per night.
* Cordial for 3 [[cp]] per goblet.
* Ale for 3 [[cp]] per tankard.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, regular patrons included [[G'axir|G'axir the Seer]] and [[Elkart]].<ref>

At some point during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the magical sign of the Blade and Stars was stolen. One Baldurian begger claimed that the thief was Aurayaun, the former innkeeper who had just recently gone missing.
