With his dying breath, the druid evoked Thorncall. The magic swiftly erected an impenetrable thorn barrier around the circle in a  radius. As of the late 14 century, the skeletal remains of Sklaerths and his four murderers still laid at the center of the circle. Stories said that the bandits were rich and perished with their wealth beside them, and Sklaerth Tholone possessed magic items sacred to Silvanus. But none risked removing the treasures from the Cairn Wheel in fear of the Oak-Fathers wrath."
