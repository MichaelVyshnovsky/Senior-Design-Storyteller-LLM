'''Galdegut's Boneyard''' was a glue factory, workshop and shop in [[Lannort]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
The Boneyard sourced a wide variety of [[bone]]s thanks to [[Morluth Galdegut]]'s network of shady suppliers. These bones were worked into various alchemical ingredients, melted into [[glue]], or sold wholesale for other purposes. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in [[Secomber]], who used bone (particularly the more durable bones of [[peryton]]s, [[owlbear]]s, [[dire wolves]], and [[fire lizard]]s) to carve pommels for weapons such [[longsword]]s.
