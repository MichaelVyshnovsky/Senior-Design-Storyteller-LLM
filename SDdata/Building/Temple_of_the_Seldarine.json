        "mainbody": "The Temple of the Seldarine was a large temple complex located in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet. \nIts main building was topped by a dome and was split into areas dedicated to the worship of the individual gods of the Seldarine, as well as a central chamber. The temple was set in a parkland containing evergreen trees and poplars. \nThe Temple of the Seldarine was created by the sun elves.\nAngharradh was not represented here because the sun elves do not regard her as part of the Seldarine. This did not cause ill feelings amongst the other elves."
