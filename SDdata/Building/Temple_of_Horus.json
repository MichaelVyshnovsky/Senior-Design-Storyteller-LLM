        "mainbody": "he Temple of Horus was an abandoned shrine to Horus in the city of Medinat Muskawoon. Martek enchanted it to serve as a means of reaching the Star of Melos-Pelar.\nThe temple of Horus was due north from the obelisk at the entrance of Medinat Muskawoon.\nThe Temple of Horus was made of eight pillars holding up a square of capstones. In the middle of the pillars lay a statue of a man sitting on a stone chair, with the head of a hawk, and a two-tiered crown. The statue and the man were of a solid piece of red-brown stone the head and the crown were carved out of another jet-black stone, save for the eyes, which were two gemstones. The entire statue radiated magic.\nThose who beseeched the aid of the god Horus would receive the eyes of the statue, which could not be pried off in any other way the area around the eyes was thoroughly scuffed with scratches and marks from previous attempts to remove them. The eyes would fall and shatter into as many people as there were adventurers these pieces granted the power of flight."
