The '''Tower of Luck''' was a temple of [[Tymora]] in [[Waterdeep]].<ref name=CoS:W-p46>

==Location==
The temple stood in the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] of the city, on the east side of the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]] between [[Ivory Street]] and [[Sighing Maiden's Walk]].<ref group="note">Page 176 of ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]'' reports that the temple is located in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]], but the poster map included with the adventure correctly places the temple in the Sea Ward, which is consistent with all previous sources. It is assumed that the location reported on p. 176 is in error.

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' 1372 DR it was led by Honorable Mistress [[Seenroas Halvinhar]]. Members of her clergy included [[Adama Miiralin]] and [[Lamris Kholl]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|15}}
