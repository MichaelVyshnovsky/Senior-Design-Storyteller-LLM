The '''Riverman''' was an old [[inn]] found in the village of [[Blackfeather Bridge (village)|Blackfeather Bridge]] in [[Featherdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Description==
This popular inn lay sprawled across the north bank of the [[River Ashaba]] spread for about a quarter of a mile. The haphazard arrangement of the many buildings made them seem randomly connected to each other versus being a single continuous structure. This was a result of the forced growth from the inn's popularity.

==Activities==
Joyous music, great food, and cozy warm beds could be found at the Riverman. Favorite dishes included buttered [[bread|toast]] with [[mushroom]]s and oysters and baked bean and goose pie. Guests were warned to not unleash [[magic]] on the premises. Many of the walls had sound-deadening and fire prevention [[spell]]s.

A bed at the Riverman cost 7 [[sp]] per night or 9 if one wanted a private room. Meals were only 2 [[cp]] for as much as one could eat, and drinks were 5 [[cp]] per serving. The wine list was quite lacking and most guests chose the [[ale]].

==Inhabitants==
A [[ghost]] named [[Albrent]] haunted the inn, but not in a menacing way. Albrent protected the inn from fire and thieves, and occasionally offered advice to those in need.
