'''Merelder Manor''' was a large mansion located in the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the [[Tentowers]] home of the well-liked [[Liontower]] noble family.

Nearly as large as the imposing [[Boldtalon Manor]] on [[Waelstar Way]], the expansive mansion was guarded by 20' (6.1 m) tall [[gold]]en lion statues, who sat upon the estate's fore-facing stone walls. The manor was fully complemented with its own stables and personal carriage house.
