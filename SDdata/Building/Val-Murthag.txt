'''Val-Murthag''', also written as '''Val Murthag''',

==Location==
It was situated on the western border of the [[Great Dale]], about two days' travel northeast of [[Bezentil]].

==Structure==
As of the late 14{{th}} century, all that remained of Val-Murthag above ground were a series of collapsed stone walls. In the vaults deep below the surface however, remained ruined dungeons that still held imprisoned [[demon]]s, [[ghost]]ly remnants of Nar priests, as well as [[artifact]]s that had been stolen from the empire of [[Raumathar]], and even the specifications of an unholy [[ritual]] that allowed for the transformation of [[human]]s into some manner of [[fiend]].

==Activities==
Val-Murthag's castle served as the empire's profane center of worship, where they could freely call upon the demons of the [[Abyss]].

==History==
The Nar fortress was destroyed by Raumathari battle-magic in the {{YearlinkName|-160}}, during the [[Great Conflagration (war)|Great Conflagration]], the last great war between the two ancient powers.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the  renegade [[Red Wizard]] [[Branimern Rythil]] and her [[imp]] [[familiar]] ventured into the ancient fortress with the aim of recovering some of its lost secrets.
