The Dragons Codpiece was a tavern in Carradoon.
The inn had a few rooms on the top floor, and was often rented out by those of the surrounding areas, such as the priests of the Edificant Library. Night Masks and those in the worship of Talona would also stay here. Alcohol and food were served here, and the Harrimans were more than happy to take such food to the patrons rooms.
A large hearth area for socializing with other patrons was located on the ground floor. The modest innkeeper allowed some patrons to sleep here.
The famed scholar, Cadderly Bonaduce, made the inn a temporary home after his choice to leave the Edificant Library. Here he studied the Tome of Universal Harmony, giving him great insights into clerical magic. In the months of staying at the Dragons Codpiece, he became attuned to the song of Deneirs holy tome. Here, he acquired the ability to detect how others were feeling by observing "shadows" on their shoulders, the power to magically command others, and many other skills.
Due to Cadderly taking up residence here, the Night Masks attacked the Dragons Codpiece through deception and pure force. Several parts of the building were destroyed, and the Edificant Librarys headmaster, Avery, as well as the innkeepers son, Brennan were killed. Here, Cadderly was able to communicate with both the spirits of Avery and Brennan. The scholar was able to bring his friend, Brennan, back to life. He found the spirit of Avery at rest with his deity, Deneir.
