'''The House on the Cliff''' was a temple of [[Umberlee]] near [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]] until it was destroyed in the [[Time of Troubles]].

==History==
The House was the largest, richest, and most powerful temple of Umberlee in [[Faerûn]] until it was ruined during the Time of Troubles in [[1358 DR]]. It was unknown if it was by the hand of Umberlee or another god, but the temple was completely destroyed and never rebuilt. A number of other prominent temples vied for dominance afterwards, including [[Shipsgrave Tower]] in [[Velen]], the [[Cove of the Queen]] in [[Mintarn]], [[Stormhaven House]] in [[Orlumbor]], and the [[Seacaves of the Roaring]] in [[Teshburl]].
