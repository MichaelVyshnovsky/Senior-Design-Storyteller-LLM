The House on the Cliff was a temple of Umberlee near Marsember in Cormyr until it was destroyed in the Time of Troubles.
The House was the largest, richest, and most powerful temple of Umberlee in Faer√ªn until it was ruined during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR. It was unknown if it was by the hand of Umberlee or another god, but the temple was completely destroyed and never rebuilt. A number of other prominent temples vied for dominance afterwards, including Shipsgrave Tower in Velen, the Cove of the Queen in Mintarn, Stormhaven House in Orlumbor, and the Seacaves of the Roaring in Teshburl.
