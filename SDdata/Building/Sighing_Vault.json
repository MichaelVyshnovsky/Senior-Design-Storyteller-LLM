        "mainbody": "The Sighing Vault was a Narfell vault in Dun-Tharos.\nThe vault extended for several hundreds of yards from the entrance to its middle it was a single underground space, with a great subterranean ceiling.\nThere was a second, smaller, round salt-white limestone dome in the approximate middle of the vault. That dome had a single entrance, which led to a narrow corridor that spiraled nine times to a single chamber in the middle of the vault its ceiling vaulted to about .\nThere were dilapidated domes, sarcophagi, containers earthernware and otherwise scattered and broken throughout. Larger vessels of stone and iron filled the cavern, so big that they resembled buildings there were narrow clear spaces between them. These vessels were sometimes carved with faces, bodies, skulls, and fell symbology. Per Ususi Manaallin, there was little magic to be detected.\nThe smaller vault in the middle was eggshell white on the inside, with nine pedestals.\nShapes inside the vault glowed with foul light. Dust had accumulated for over a millenium. The slightest sound created whispering echoes.\nThe demon Eschar guarded the vault. The inner dome of the vault could only be accessed by walking around it nine times, each time speaking aloud the name and title of one lord of the Nine Hells in order.\nAs of , four of the nine pedestals in the center dome were empty of the other five, only one held its original item a night black cloak draped across a perfectly shaped hanger. The last four held items collected by Eschar, including a red dagger made of a single red talon, an orb of hazy green set in a golden ring, a sword made of bone, and the Queen Abidings controlling token. After Ususi Manaallin opened the vault, the priest Marrec recovered the token.\n*Eschar"
