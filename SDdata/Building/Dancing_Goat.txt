The '''Dancing Goat''' was a bawdy tavern in [[Silverymoon]].

==Location==
The Dancing Goat was found on the right side of the [[Moonway]] in [[Northbank]], just after one crossed the [[Moonbridge]] from the southern half of the city.

==Interior==
The tavern had a revelry-filled dance floor. The rest of the establishment contained dimly lit hallways and upstairs rooms.

===Atmosphere===
The Dancing Goat was busy, noisy, and full of raucous entertainment twenty-four-ten. It was ''not'' a place for peace and quiet. It catered to single folk hoping to flirt or find a partner, and professional escorts often went there too. Unfortunately, it also tended to attract pickpockets and other [[rogue]]s.

==Services==
The tavern had a surprisingly good selection of beverages, with literally hundreds of vintages stored in its cellar.

==History==
The Dancing Goat had been in business since at least [[1358 DR]].

==Rumors==
A secret door somewhere in the tavern was said to connect with a network of subterranean passageways beneath the [[Silverglen]] and leading ultimately to [[Harper Hall]].
