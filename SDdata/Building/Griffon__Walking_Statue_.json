        "mainbody": "The [[Walking Statue of Waterdeep]] known as the '''Griffon''' materialized in [[Waterdeep]]  in [[1479 DR]] in response to an attempted intrusion into [[Ahghairon's Tower]]. After flying over the city, it came to rest facing southeast toward the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] on [[Mount Waterdeep]] near [[Peaktop Aerie]]. Due to its location, many believed it was simply a monument to the [[Griffon Cavalry]], but that was not true.\n\nThe statue itself appeared as its name implies—a [[griffon]] standing on all four legs, although it was approximately twenty feet tall and made of [[granite]]."
