        "mainbody": "he Dark Arch, sometimes called Closeguard Bridge, was a bridge that connected the South Bank of Luskan to Closeguard Island in the River Mirar.\nIt was a short, arching bridge that continued from the Darkwalk on the South Bank. It had securable gates, and only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or of Ship Kurth were permitted to cross the bridge under normal circumstances.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Arcane Brotherhood had placed a secret ward on the Dark Arch that alerted them if anyone not affiliated with their faction were to cross it, and the Archmage Arcane Arklem Greeth had further strengthened its magical defenses. At the same time, the bridge had been rigged by Kurth engineers to be able to collapse in case of an attack.\nWhen forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the , a major turning point occurred when High Captain Kurth permitted their forces to cross the Dark Arch and Sword Bridge to attack Cutlass Island and the Host Tower of the Arcane by land."
