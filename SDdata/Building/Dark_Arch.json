        "mainbody": "The '''Dark Arch''', sometimes called '''Closeguard Bridge''', was a bridge that connected the [[Luskan/South Bank|South Bank]] of [[Luskan]] to [[Closeguard Island]] in the [[River Mirar]].",
        "Structure": "It was a short, arching bridge that continued from the [[Darkwalk]] on the South Bank. It had securable gates, and only members of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] or of [[Ship Kurth]] were permitted to cross the bridge under normal circumstances.",
        "Defenses": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Arcane Brotherhood had placed a secret [[ward]] on the Dark Arch that alerted them if anyone not affiliated with their faction were to cross it, and the [[Archmage Arcane]] [[Arklem Greeth]] had further strengthened its [[magic]]al defenses. At the same time, the bridge had been rigged by Kurth engineers to be able to collapse in case of an attack.",
        "History": "When forces led by [[Deudermont]] and Lord [[Brambleberry]] attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, a major turning point occurred when [[Kurth|High Captain Kurth]] permitted their forces to cross the Dark Arch and [[Sword Bridge]] to attack [[Cutlass Island]] and the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] by land."
