        "mainbody": "The '''Legacy of Deep Death''' was a temple dedicated to [[Myrkul]], located on the sea bed of the [[Sea of Swords]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was unique in that it was the only Myrkulyte temple created after the deity's destruction during the [[Time of Troubles]]. The temple was [[magic]]ally constructed by three [[cleric]]-[[lich]]es who continued to venerate the Lord of Bones beyond his destruction on [[Toril]].\n\nThe temple was protected by number of monstrous sea creatures including an [[undead]] [[kraken]] and horribly mutated [[sahuagin]].",
        "History": "When Myrkul was destroyed by [[Midnight]] atop the [[Blackstaff Tower]] in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1358 DR]], his body swelled with grim energy that was on the verge of exploding. Just prior to this, the young [[mage]] cast a ''[[dimension door]]'', in an effort to transport the Dark God's body away from the city, over the Sea of Swords. Myrkul's body detonated in the sky, spewing forth a mephitic cloud of death that rained down in a {{SI|5|mile|long=yes}} radius. The sea floor was was permanently tainted and continuously produced throngs of aquatic undead, including [[lacedon]]s and [[sea zombie]]s. The temple was erected in the center of this tainted area."
