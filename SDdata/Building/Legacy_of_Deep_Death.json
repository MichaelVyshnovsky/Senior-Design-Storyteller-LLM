        "mainbody": "he Legacy of Deep Death was a temple dedicated to Myrkul, located on the sea bed of the Sea of Swords during the 14 century DR. It was unique in that it was the only Myrkulyte temple created after the deitys destruction during the Time of Troubles. The temple was magically constructed by three cleric-liches who continued to venerate the Lord of Bones beyond his destruction on Toril.\nThe temple was protected by number of monstrous sea creatures including an undead kraken and horribly mutated sahuagin.\nWhen Myrkul was destroyed by Midnight atop the Blackstaff Tower in Waterdeep in 1358 DR, his body swelled with grim energy that was on the verge of exploding. Just prior to this, the young mage cast a dimension door, in an effort to transport the Dark Gods body away from the city, over the Sea of Swords. Myrkuls body detonated in the sky, spewing forth a mephitic cloud of death that rained down in a  radius. The sea floor was was permanently tainted and continuously produced throngs of aquatic undead, including lacedons and sea zombies. The temple was erected in the center of this tainted area."
