The '''Northlook''' was an [[inn]] in [[Bryn Shander]].

==Location==
The inn was located next to Bryn Shander's North Gate.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The Northlook was frequented mostly by adventurers and mercenaries. For that reason, it was a very dangerous place, but also the best source for information and rumors of the [[Ten Towns]] region.

==Services==
The proprietor, [[Scramsax]], charged exorbitant rates for all services at the inn. He also had a policy of opening lines of credit for customers and then charging them later with large interests, ruthlessly enforcing that they be paid.
