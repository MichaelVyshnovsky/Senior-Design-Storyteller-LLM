The Northlook was an inn in Bryn Shander.
The inn was located next to Bryn Shanders North Gate.
The Northlook was frequented mostly by adventurers and mercenaries. For that reason, it was a very dangerous place, but also the best source for information and rumors of the Ten Towns region.
The proprietor, Scramsax, charged exorbitant rates for all services at the inn. He also had a policy of opening lines of credit for customers and then charging them later with large interests, ruthlessly enforcing that they be paid.
