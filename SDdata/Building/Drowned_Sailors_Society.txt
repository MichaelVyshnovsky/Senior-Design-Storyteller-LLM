The Drowned Sailors Society was a club in Marsember, Cormyr.
Volo had noted that few clubs were overtly acknowledged in Marsember. While The Drowned Sailors Society and its smoky ambience was one of only two he could find that did not engage in underhanded businesses, he did not consider visiting it worthwhile.
The club was frequented by old sailors looking to get drunk, who would would recount rather incoherent renditions of their journeys.
