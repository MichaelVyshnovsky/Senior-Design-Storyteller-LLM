        "Location": "[[File:Student of Miresk's.png|thumb|right|200px|''The pompous students of Miresk's School were the first most thought of when thinking of Silverymoon's wizards.'']]\nThe school was located in the [[Southbank]] of Silverymoon, the newer section of the city.",
        "Description": "The building was constructed of dark, bristling stone and was very castle-like, with side-turrets, flying buttresses, and balconies.",
        "Inhabitants": "The school was the private home of its headmaster, [[Eltro Miresk]]. Those who studied here were also made to wear uniforms, later becoming iconic of the school with their red [[robe]]s. At the waist, students further wore a long [[sash]]. This served to tell each individual's rank, and could be of either black, grey, or white coloration. They also carried with them their [[birch]] [[staves]], which were tall and whose tops were ornamented by [[raven]] feathers.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], Miresk agreed to merge his school into the Conclave of Silverymoon and was appointed the first Magus Senior of that university.",
        "Services": "As a college within the Conclave, the School of Thaumaturgy was where both [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s applying to programs at the [[Lady's College]] or elsewhere in the university were first evaluated for placement. They could be either accepted into the program or placed on a waiting list."
