        "Location": "Ikeshia's Crypt was nestled between the [[Crypt of Kesefehon]] to the north and [[Lyssic's Crypt]] to south-west.",
        "Structure": "This crypt was one the smaller size but was masterfully built, encrusted in [[marble]], its walls lined with intricate frescos.",
        "Interior": "Ikeshia's Crypt was a small chamber. The room held several sarcofagi of Ikeshia's family. One of which had a hidden panel in its floor that held withered manuscripts, old [[inkwell]]s, [[sealing wax]], and single [[gold]]en seal with the elven noble family crest.",
        "History": "Before [[Myth Drannor]]'s destruction in the [[Weeping War]], this crypt was sealed with elven ''word of power'' \"haladrin\" and the ''rune of cats''. In [[1369 DR]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]] occupied the ruins of the City of Song and Ikeshia's Crypt was one of the tombs unsealed and ransacked by them."
