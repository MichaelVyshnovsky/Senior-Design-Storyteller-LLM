        "Description": "This building served as the barracks for the [[holy slayer]]s of the [[Everlasting]]. The barracks were segregated by both sex and race. Women were quartered in the northern part, and men in the southern.\n\nAbstract mosaics decorated the halls of the barracks, depicting bizarre cloudlike figures and spirals. The actual quarters were bereft of any decoration that might distract a holy slayer from their work.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many of the factions of the Everlasting were quartered here, including the [[Loyalists]], [[Preachers]], [[Sword Dancers]], and [[Winged Bulls]].\n\n[[Farouk Abd al-Bazan]] and [[Nusrah bin Kerim]] led their factions from the Halls of the Faithful."
