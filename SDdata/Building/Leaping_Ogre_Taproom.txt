The '''Leaping Ogre Taproom''' was an eatery on the outskirts of [[Telflamm]] found just outside the legal city limits.

==Description==
It was a rambling edifice; services for traders such as stables, warehouses, carts sprang all around it. According to some, caravans headed for the [[Golden Way]] used the construction as a touchstone; every morning at dawn, as of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, work was assigned to arriving mercenaries. [[Raidon Kane]] found out as much that year.{{cite book/Stardeep|42}}

Private rooms were available.
