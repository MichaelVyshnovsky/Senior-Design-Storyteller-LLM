'''Abysm''' was the fortress and palace of the [[demon lord]] [[Demogorgon]], located in his realm in the [[Abyss]].

==Location==
Abysm was located in the ocean portion of [[Gaping Maw]], the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 88: Gaping Maw|88{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]]. It lay about 100 miles (160 km) off the shores of the city of [[Lemoriax]]

==Structure==
The fortress consisted of two serpentine towers topped with skull-shaped minarets. The towers extended deep below sea level until they reached an opening into the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 89: The Shadowsea|Shadowsea]].

==Interior==
The interior of Abysm was marked by twisting stairways and halls.

==Activities==
[[File:Abysm map 4e.jpg|thumb|''Map of Abysm within the Gaping Maw.'']]
Demogorgon walked the halls of Abysm meditating on the mysteries of the Abyss and forming his plans. Demogorgon also used the towers to channel his [[arcane]] abilities in order to acquire secrets of the Abyss.

The underwater portion of the fortress was used to work experiments and pacts with the [[obyrith]] [[Dagon]], which sometimes resulted in sentient creatures that walked the towers' halls.

==Defenses==
The maddening presence of Demogorgon induced powerful latent magic effects within Abysm. Some manifested spontaneously, while others were available at the demon lord's will. For example, Demogorgon could summon illusory copies of himself within his lair and could cast the ''[[darkness]]'' spell a number of times. Continuous latent effects included the spontaneous manifestation of [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and other poisonous creatures. The environment could drive [[beast]]s aggressive and insane and could also bring madness to [[humanoid]]s that lingered too long.
