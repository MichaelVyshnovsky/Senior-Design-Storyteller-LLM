Murensturs Imported Vintages was a wine shop in Suzail, Cormyr, in the late 15 century DR.
Almost certainly, the store sold vintages.
The owner, Belgryn Murenstur, was kept from going back home one evening before the Council of the Dragon, where he was briefly pressed into service by the blueflame ghosts Treth Halonter and Relve Langral while on their murderous rampage.
