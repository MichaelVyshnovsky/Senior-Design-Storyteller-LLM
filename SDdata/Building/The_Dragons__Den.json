        "mainbody": "'''The Dragons' Den''' was a tavern in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]], owned by [[Oleg One-Ear]].\n\nThe tavern was taken over by the rowdy [[Purple Dragons]] garrison in town, quite against Oleg's original wishes, but he knew to mind his own business.\n\nIt became the soldiers' own hangout, and catered exclusively to them. Civilians who dared step inside without a Purple Dragon companion—and this happened only rarely—were likely to be pelted with tankards and even chairs. Those who persisted were beaten up and thrown out.\n\nWith patrons like these, the Den had no need of a bouncer.",
