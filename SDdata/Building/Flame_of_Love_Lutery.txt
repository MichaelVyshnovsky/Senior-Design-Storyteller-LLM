'''The Flame of Love Lutery''' was a cramped shop in [[Jester's Green]] that sold a wide variety of items for the romantically inclined.

==Services==
True to its name, the shop did sell [[lute]]s, but the main focus of its business were trinkets and other small items in high demand by the [[Purple Dragons|local soldiers]] for their distant loves. The shop provided goods such as pre-written poems and love notes, scented [[candle]]s, magically-preserved flowers, miscellaneous keepsakes, bottles of [[wine]], and [[lingerie]]. The shop also sold salacious [[broadsheet]]s such as ''[[The Elf Maiden and the Unicorn]]'', ''[[High Ladies in Love]]'', and ''[[The Maiden Said Maybe]]'' for 1 [[sp]] apiece, as well as romantic (or pornographic) pictures that usually went for 6 sp each, but could go from 1 sp to 10 [[gp]].
