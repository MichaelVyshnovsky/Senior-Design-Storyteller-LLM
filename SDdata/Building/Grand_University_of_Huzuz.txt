The Grand University of Huzuz was a school located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Grand University could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
Fanya bint Parigar was the head of the Grand University. She employed teachers and instructors, including Fatima Asad, a language teacher.
The Grand University enrolled a few hundred students for a three-year course covering topics such as business, language, history, and etiquette.
Despite its name, the Grand University was actually a small school, though Fanya did have lofty aspirations that it would one day be the most respected school in all of Huzuz.
