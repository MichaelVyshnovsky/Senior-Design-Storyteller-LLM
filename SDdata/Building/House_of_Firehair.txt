'''The House of Firehair''' was an enormous fortified cathedral dedicated to [[Sune]] that sat atop a pastoral hill in the middle of [[Daerlun]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Structure==
Walls surrounded the entire hill that the House of Firehair stood upon, separating it from the rest of [[Daerlun]]. The central structure was composed of numerous buildings, each connected with those nearby by soaring stone bridges. The House of Firehair maintained a warm and habitable atmosphere even during the winter months and was decorated with hanging plants. The priests raised and tended to the beautiful birds that would perch on the cathedrals creeping plants. Its graceful arches were famed all across [[Faerûn]] as the pinnacle of gentle beauty.

==History==
The House of Firehair was older than Daerlun itself, as the city grew up from a small village that was originally founded to serve the temple's inhabitants. By [[1374 DR]] the temple still stood.

==Inhabitants==
By [[1358 DR]], The House of Firehair was led by [[High Priestess]] [[Thauna Maskalar]]. Serving the high priestess were a total of 48 [[cleric]]s, all [[human]]s and [[half-elves]], and 336 lay followers. These worshipers of Sune helped to tend the sprawling complex and sacred enclave. Thauna and her followers still resided there even by [[1374 DR]].
