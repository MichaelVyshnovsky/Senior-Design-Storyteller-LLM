The Leaning Boot was an especially poor-quality tavern found in the city of Mulmaster, that defied the odds by remaining in business for well over a centurys time.
It could be found within the Docks Quarter of the city.While it is not explicitly stated this location is found in the Docks Quarter, they are located at or in the docks, which are considered a part of the Docks Quarter.
The Leaning Boot was found within the basement of dockside house, accessible by a set of rickety stairs. With no other identifiable markers, the entrance could be found by the old, salt-worn boot that had been nailed to a wooden post. The building above was an apartment building.
The inn offered its patrons the unique ambiance that arose from the combination of discreet conversation the aromatic bouquet of salt water, stale ale, and sea-battered wood, as well the ever-present threat of being stabbed in the arm.
