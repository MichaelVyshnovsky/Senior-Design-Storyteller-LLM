        "Location": "The House Invincible was located in [[Northbank]] in Silverymoon, near [[Hunter's Gate]] and overlooking [[the Market]].",
        "Structure": "The temple looked like a fortified stone keep; it had no high spires or artistic designs in its construction. The design of the temple was not just a facade; at times, it had served as an actual fortress and garrison for troops.",
        "History": "After the [[Time of Troubles]], the [[Church of Helm]] across [[Faerûn]] saw a reduction in numbers&mdash;not so in Silverymoon, where temple attendance remained high. This was because most of the [[Knights in Silver]], the [[High Guard]], and a good number of the [[Spellguard]] were worshipers of Helm who believed in the watchful protection of their beloved city. In fact, the temple saw an increase in worshipers between the years [[1360 DR|1360]] and [[1370 DR]].\n\nAs early as [[1358 DR]], the temple was led by [[Church of Helm|Vigilant Master]] [[Erssler Thamm]].\n\nAfter the formation of the [[Silver Marches]] in the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], Master Erssler, without having to be asked, offered the temple to be used temporarily for offices, quarters, a chapel, and an assembly hall for [[Methrammar Aerasumé]] and his growing [[Argent Legion]].\n\nAfter Erssler sacrificed his life defending travelers from [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[Wolf|wolves]], he was replaced by Vigilant Master [[Baerim Coraddor]], whom Helm selected personally by a visible manifestation on the battlefield.",
