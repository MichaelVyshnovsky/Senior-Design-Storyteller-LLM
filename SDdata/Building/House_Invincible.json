        "mainbody": "The House Invincible was a major temple to Helm in Silverymoon.\nThe House Invincible was located in Northbank in Silverymoon, near Hunters Gate and overlooking the Market.\nThe temple looked like a fortified stone keep it had no high spires or artistic designs in its construction. The design of the temple was not just a facade at times, it had served as an actual fortress and garrison for troops.\nAfter the Time of Troubles, the Church of Helm across Faerûn saw a reduction in numbers&mdashnot so in Silverymoon, where temple attendance remained high. This was because most of the Knights in Silver, the High Guard, and a good number of the Spellguard were worshipers of Helm who believed in the watchful protection of their beloved city. In fact, the temple saw an increase in worshipers between the years 1360 and 1370 DR.\nAs early as 1358 DR, the temple was led by Vigilant Master Erssler Thamm.\nAfter the formation of the Silver Marches in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, Master Erssler, without having to be asked, offered the temple to be used temporarily for offices, quarters, a chapel, and an assembly hall for Methrammar Aerasumé and his growing Argent Legion.\nAfter Erssler sacrificed his life defending travelers from fiendish wolves, he was replaced by Vigilant Master Baerim Coraddor, whom Helm selected personally by a visible manifestation on the battlefield.\nCategoryTemples to Helm\nCategoryTemples\nCategoryHelmite locations\nCategoryLocations in Northbank\nCategoryLocations in Silverymoon\nCategoryLocations in Luruar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n8zqrlmfmcsqfzvxyffb3q7p2ti14gog"
