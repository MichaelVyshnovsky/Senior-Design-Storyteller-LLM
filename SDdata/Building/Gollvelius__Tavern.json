        "mainbody": "'''Gollvelius' Tavern''' was a tavern in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], located to the southwest of the city. It was a retreat for many of the [[drow]].\n\nHere, a band of adventurers from [[Icewind Dale]] found [[Jarlaxle]], and they exchanged information. He informed the party that the people captured from their village might be used as fodder in a war between drow houses, in which they would be sent forth to activate the protective [[House defense glyph|glyph]]s.\n\nOn the advice of [[Rizzen Do'Urden]], the companions returned to Gollvelius' Tavern to speak again with Jarlaxle. He made a promise to supply them with the [[House Do'Urden]] insignia, in exchange for a [[gold]]en necklace, found in the [[Mantle]] caverns. Jarlaxle didn't fully commit to his promise, but instead revealed to the party that a drow patrol of young nobles carried the insignia in another set of caverns nearby."
