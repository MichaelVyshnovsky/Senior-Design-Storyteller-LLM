        "mainbody": "The Temple of Auril was a place of worship dedicated to Auril within the Thayan city of Bezantur.\nThis temple was a rather small, domed structure that was white in color.\nThe small but fervent congregation was known to be constantly warning other Thayans about the inevitable coming of terrible winters. They believed that Auril would soon ally with other evil deities to drive away more goodly gods like Chauntea, Mystra, and Tyr.\nWorship of Auril&mdashas with most of the Gods of Fury save for Malar&mdashwas not popular in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles."
