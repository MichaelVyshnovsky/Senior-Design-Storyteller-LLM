        "mainbody": "he Black Rat was a murky but offered well-appreciated genuine hospitality, especially for the area it was located in Suzail of Cormyr.\nThe Black Rat was located to the east of Suzails marketplace near one of the citys docks.\nThe Black Rat was located just several doors to the west from Starsails House, the headquarters of Suzails Seafarers Guild.\nThe main taproom had low ceiling and dark interior. The room was filled with wobbly chairs and uneven tables. The northern wall of the room was dominated by a fireplace. The dirty windows let little daylight in.\nThe Black Rat was often full, filled with folk and pipe smoke that cling to the air. The Rat could accommodate around two dozen clients. The tavern was filled with aromas of pipeweed and sizzling meat. Brawls were rare and notably bloodless at the Rat.\nThe Rat offered food and drink. The breakfast time was the busiest of the day.\nIn 1360 DR, the Black Rat tavern in Suzail was visited by King Azoun Obarskyr IV disguised as an elderly commoner. During the tumultuous time directly preceding the Crusade against the Tuigan Horde, the King was there to see the reaction of his subjects to the announced war. There, he met Ambrosius, a paladin who was able to see through the disguise, thinking Azoun to be one of the kings spies. During that evening, Ambrosius informed the discussed king that many Cormyrians signed up to be part of the army, the paladin himself included. During that time the tavern was frequented by the members of the Trappers Guild the organization actively opposing the Tuigan Wars as well as attempted assassination of King Azoun the same year.\nBetween 1360 DR and 1362 DR, and likely much longer, the Rat employed one barmaid who lived in the tavern. She was a jolly and frumpy red-headed woman."
