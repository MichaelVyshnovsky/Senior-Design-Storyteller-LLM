        "mainbody": "Tower Ch没mavhraele was a drow-controlled castle located in the Deep Wastes of the Underdark beneath the city of Ravens Bluff in the 15 century DR. The castle was home to the drow clan House Ch没mavh, led by the Marquise Dresimil Ch没mavh. The castle was constructed some time between 1367 DR and 1479 DR.\nThe castle was an imposing structure in a huge cavern that also contained an ancient drow-built mythal. The castle was surrounded by forests of huge mushrooms the size of trees as well as paddocks where rothe were raised. The interior of the castle had the typical chambers one would expect to find in a castle, such as dungeon cells and a kitchen. It also had a huge throne room with a spider-shaped throne.\nIn addition to the drow elves, Castle Ch没mavhraele was home to slaves of many races."
