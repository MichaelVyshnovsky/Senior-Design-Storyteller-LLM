        "Location": "Fisher's Wharf stood on the coastal border of the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] section of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] in Baldur's Gate. [[Sailor's Crossing]] was located just a street away to the south, and [[Jopalin's]] [[tea]] and [[kaeth]] cafe was built on the outer side of the block that faced Fisher's Wharf.\n\nFirst thing in the morning, all fishing vessels departed the pier, leaving behind docked houseboats of those who lived on the water.",
        "History": "In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, on [[Kythorn 19]], the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. The nearby Fisher's Wharf had one witness â€“ the aging [[alchemist]] named [[Drusilla (alchemist)|Drusilla]]. She lives in a distinctly decorated docked boat. The investigator named [[Tav]] was familiar with the alchemist and discussed what she heard during the murder over a cup of tea."
