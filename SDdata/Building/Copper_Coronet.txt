The '''Copper Coronet''' was a very large, but depressingly dingy tavern located in the [[River District (Athkatla)|River District]] of [[Athkatla]]. It attracted the lowest rung of Athkatlan society: smugglers, pirates and the "blank-for-hire" type of independent entrepreneurs. Tourists to the city, and even most citizens of Athkatla refused to step one foot within its doors.

==Description==
The Coronet's taproom was dominated by its notably long bar; off it's side was a small privy, which was absolutely disgusting and smelled of sea-water. Behind the bar was the tavern's kitchen, which had an underground pantry.

; 1369:
Up until the year [[1369 DR]], the Copper Coronet was owned by the wealthy, suspicious and completely unscrupulous slave-trader [[Lehtinan]]. The bar was run by [[Bernard]].

;1370-:
Some time after [[1370 DR]] the Copper Coronet changed hands to [[Sarvo Droostan|"Old Sarvo"]], a weary man who, despite his surroundings, managed to maintain his sense of humor.

Sarvo was supported, in great effort, by four bartenders: [[Bordovan]], [[Delric]], [[Othlo]] and [[Vaermaer]]. These mountains of men at the Coronet, acting as the bar's protectors and bouncers.

The tavern's two cheerful barmaids were [[Jalith]] and [[Maerae]], who genuinely had a great time serving the patrons of the Copper Coronet, despite its filth and danger. They always treated their customers with honestly and genuine joy.

Behind the bar, in the tavern's kitchen was the Coronet's surly cook, [[Skratha|Old Skratha]], This old, ill-tempered women had the warts and temperament of a [[troll]], which likely contributed to the rumors that she had monstrous heritage.

;1369:
While under the ownership of Lehtinan, the Coronet offered a scant variety of drinks including [[Bitter Black]], [[Amnian ale]], [[Shadowdark ale]], [[Suzale]] and a brew from [[Golden Sands Brews|Golden Sands]].

;1370:
The big draw of the Copper Coronet were the "''[[sark]]s''" prepared and provided by Old Skratha. These meals consisted of hallowed-out chunks of stale roundbread, filled with a watery stew made from the guts of bottom-feeder [[fish]], [[dog]] and rat meat, dew-worms and [[herb]]s gathered from the [[Grave District (Athkatla)|Grave District]]. In spite its contents, it was a greatly-appreciated meal by local river district Athkatlans, as it was typically the only meal they could afford.

When Sarvo found a good enough price, he would purchase casks of watered-down ale or wine to serve at the bar.
