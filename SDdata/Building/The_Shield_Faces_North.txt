The '''Shield Faces North''' was one of the oldest taverns located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Location==
The tavern was located near the center of Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]] along [[Harbor Street]] near the waterfront.

==Activities==
The Shield Faces North was a popular tavern for those wishing to enjoy a quiet evening. Among the usual crowd were [[halfling]]s, [[dwarves]], and older merchants. The serene atmosphere within the tavern existed because the strict access to the Harbor District prevented most of Zhentil Keep's scum from entering.
