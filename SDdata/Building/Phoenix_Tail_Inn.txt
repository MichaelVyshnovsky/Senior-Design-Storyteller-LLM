The '''Phoenix Tail Inn''' was the only inn within the [[Crossroad Keep]]'s walls on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Phoenix Tail Inn was a three-story building that stood in the southern part of the Crossroad Keep. Its first floor was made out of stone bricks, while the second and third floors were wooden. A single sign hung above the inn's entrance.

==Interior==
The inn had a spacious dining hall decorated with rustic furniture, carpets, dining tables, and couches and chairs. A stone fireplace had the head of a large [[wolf]] mounted over it.

==History==
The Phoenix Tail Inn was taken over by [[Sal (Neverwinter)|Sal]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, after the Crossroad Keep was liberated by the [[adventurer]] known as the [[Kalach-Cha]], who was assigned to be its Knight-Captain. Sal was a barkeep who worked at a tavern run by the Knight-Captain's uncle in Neverwinter. Sometime after the [[Shadow War]] of 1374 DR, Sal sold the struggling business to [[Huldur]]. Under the new ownership, the Phoenix Tail Inn fed local laborers who worked for the Keep and passing adventurers and hunters who dealt with local [[worg]] infestation. Some of these individuals were [[Ulweth]], a [[dwarf]] worg hunter; [[Daija]] of [[Waukeen]] who stayed there until she opened a shrine in the fortress; and [[Nall]], an adventurer-turned-militia instructor.
