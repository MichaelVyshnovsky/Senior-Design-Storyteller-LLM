Evening Star Inn was the only inn in the village of Freedale in the Dalelands. Most travelers had to stay in the friendly inn or resort to sleeping in the West Wind Stables.
Evening Star Inn was located next door to the home of Taran Goldenstar the Elflord, with the Watch Guard Barracks to the back of the building, and across the street from the house of Foxworth the Moneylender.
The inn was a three-story building with yellow walls and a red-hued roof that housed the buildings attic and sprouted two chimneys on the street side and the structures back.
A spacious inn, the Evening Star offered lodgings and had plenty of space for travelers most of the time. The inns guests were offered two meals a day and a bath for the price of one room. The lodgings were one- and two-bed rooms, each furnished with a table, bowl, a pitcher of water, a lantern, and a chest for the guests possessions.
The Evening Star Inn owner, Toobar Starlight was a lovely man who could often be found on the inns roof at night, studying the stars. His wife, Katherine Starlight, handled cooking and cleaning for the inn and was just as beloved by townies and the inns guests.
