The '''Mikitan Shipyards''' was a large compound found in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The shipyards were located in southern Daggerford near the [[River Gate]] along the [[Hill Road]] and [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]].

==Description==
The Mikitan Shipyards was a large workshop that had enough space to build large vessels. This gave it a notable advantage over their main competitor, the adjacent but smaller [[Dekoran Boatwright]].
