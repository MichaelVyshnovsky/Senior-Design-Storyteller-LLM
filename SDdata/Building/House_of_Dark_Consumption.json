        "mainbody": "he House of Dark Consumption was a building located in the lower Deep Wastes.\nThe House of Dark Consumption was avoided by any creature, both living and constructs, with any sense. Even the undead avoided the house. Any who entered the structure were either killed or left in a such a weakened state they were easy prey for the many predators of the Underdark.\nThe House of Dark Consumption looked like a regular, unassuming stone house. Upon entering the front door, an individual was greeted with a dark icy interior. The inside was much larger than the exterior, an extra-dimensional maze of corridors, room and twisting turns.

Paradoxically, the house was also a dead-magic zone.\nThe interior was dark, so dark it dimmed any light source. The light from a torch only illuminated an area of . Marking a way through the maze was impossible. Unattended equipment, including paint on walls, rotted away within hours. Equipment carried by a creature rotted away at a slower pace, with armor and weapons rusting away in several days.\nAny creature who spent a full day inside had a significant risk of suffering the effects of an insanity spell."
