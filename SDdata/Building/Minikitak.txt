A '''minikitak''' was a temporary structure used by [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iskotuk'']].

==Description==
In regions characterized by thin permafrost and abundant vegetation, iskotuk constructed temporary dwellings known as minikitak. These structures were made from a combination of wood and earth, incorporating several design principles employed in [[snowhouse]] construction.

==Construction==
To begin the construction process, four wooden poles were firmly planted into the ground, forming a square shape. Across the top of these poles, branches were placed to create a framework. Additional branches were leaned against the frame to form walls, while others were balanced on top to serve as a roof. Next, a tunnel was excavated from the outside, leading into the interior of the structure.

Finally, a combination of snow, loose dirt, and chunks of ice was piled against all four sides, gradually forming a layer approximately {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} thick at the bottom and thinner towards the top. If the roof was sturdy enough, the iskotuk added a layer of dirt and snow, about {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} deep. However, if the roof was not as strong, they must rely on more branches and a thinner layer of snow. A small opening was left on the roof to allow for ventilation.
