The Treants Treat was a famous tavern found in the city of Myth Drannor.
It was located on the corner of Phelindra Stree and Suldars Walk, in the inclusive district of Dlabraddath.
The Treants Treat comprised a ground-level building and the three underground levels that descended beneath, which included the taverns taproom. The subterranean walls of the establishment were entwined with the roots of Myth Drannors great many trees.
The tavern was well known for being the first establishment in Myth Drannor that did not discriminate its patronage in any manner.
It was rumored that the subterranean root system that made its way into the taverns basement was once inhabited by two different deities, Arvoreen and Mystra. In truth they were just animated by an elven tree spirit that simply wished to enjoy a discussion with their former kin.
