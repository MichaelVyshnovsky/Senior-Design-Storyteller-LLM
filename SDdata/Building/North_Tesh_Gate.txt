The North Tesh Gate was the southeastern entry point into the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The North Tesh Gate sat on the northern side of the Tesh Bridge that spanned the River Tesh where it met the Moonsea.
The gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers. Furthermore, a pair Zhentilar guardposts were located just inside the gate.
The North Tesh Gate provided access to both the Common Quarter and Harbor District in southeastern Zhentil Keep from the Foreign Quarter via the Tesh Bridge.
