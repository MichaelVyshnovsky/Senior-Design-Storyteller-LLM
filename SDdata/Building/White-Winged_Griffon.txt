The '''White-Winged Griffon''', known locally as the '''Whitewings''', was a rundown inn found in the city of [[Yartar]].

==Structure==
It was an old and drafty wooden house that offered little comfort from the frigid winds of [[the North]]. Privacy was granted by the thin partitions, which did little more than separate each room.

===Atmosphere===
As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was infested with [[rat]]s.

==Services==
The Whitewings offered small single-bed rooms of poor quality for the rock-bottom fee of 1 [[cp]] per night. Use of the soap bucket however, had an exorbitant fee of 1 [[gp]].

Interestingly enough, the inn did offer services to individuals other than its patrons. Its proprietors were informants for the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Hand of Yartar]], and regularly fed them information regarding those that stayed within their establishment.
