The '''Halls of Inspiration''' was a temple in the city of [[Silverymoon]] dedicated to the [[deities]] [[Oghma]] and [[Milil]].

==Location==
Silverglen was located in the eastern part of the [[Northbank]] section of Silverymoon. It was north of the [[Silverglen]], west of the [[High Palace]], and east of the city's [[Market (Silverymoon)|Market]].

==Structure==
The Halls of Inspiration was a rectangular structure with a tall tower situated in each of its four corners.

===Interior===
The main floor of the temple comprised a three-story, open amphitheater and chapel, with balconies lining the walls overhead. The top floor contained the living quarters and offices of the temple's [[priest]]s. Within each of the four towers were extensive libraries, multiple rooms for prayer, and study rooms.

Beneath the structure were four basements. These contained further libraries, guestrooms for visiting [[bard]]s and worshipers, and the vaults in which church reliquaries were held.

==Reputation==
Many considered this temple to be one of Silverymoon's major landmarks. It also had a reputation for hosting some of the best music and lore-tales in [[the North]].

==Inhabitants==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple run was by the city's chief [[priest]] of Oghma, [[Sandrew|Sandrew the Wise]]. Around that same time, a priestess of Milil by the name of [[Mandaliz]] inhabited the temple.

Following Sandrew's decision to move to [[Waterdeep]] ''circa'' [[1362 DR]], the temple was run by Songmaster [[Beldor Thrivvin]] and Chief Priest [[Irithym Winiter]]. They were assisted in temple operations by First Singer [[Corbas Daerhjan]]. The rest of the temple's clergy was largely made up of bards and loremasters.
