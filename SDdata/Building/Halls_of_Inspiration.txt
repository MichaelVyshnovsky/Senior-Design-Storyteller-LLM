The Halls of Inspiration was a temple in the city of Silverymoon dedicated to the deities Oghma and Milil.
Silverglen was located in the eastern part of the Northbank section of Silverymoon. It was north of the Silverglen, west of the High Palace, and east of the citys Market.
The Halls of Inspiration was a rectangular structure with a tall tower situated in each of its four corners.
The main floor of the temple comprised a three-story, open amphitheater and chapel, with balconies lining the walls overhead. The top floor contained the living quarters and offices of the temples priests. Within each of the four towers were extensive libraries, multiple rooms for prayer, and study rooms.
Beneath the structure were four basements. These contained further libraries, guestrooms for visiting bards and worshipers, and the vaults in which church reliquaries were held.
Many considered this temple to be one of Silverymoons major landmarks. It also had a reputation for hosting some of the best music and lore-tales in the North.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, the temple run was by the citys chief priest of Oghma, Sandrew the Wise. Around that same time, a priestess of Milil by the name of Mandaliz inhabited the temple.
Following Sandrews decision to move to Waterdeep circa 1362 DR, the temple was run by Songmaster Beldor Thrivvin and Chief Priest Irithym Winiter. They were assisted in temple operations by First Singer Corbas Daerhjan. The rest of the temples clergy was largely made up of bards and loremasters.
