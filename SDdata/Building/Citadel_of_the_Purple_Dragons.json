It shared the citys massive  tall walls.\nThe Citadel of the Purple Dragons was under the command of the Lord Magister of the City. In the late 14 century DR, Sthavar served as the Lord Magister. Under his control, the garrison of the Purple Dragons was numbered at three hundred patrollers active at a time. Additional barracks were nestled by the citys walls.\nThe fortress was also home to the Imperial Navy and housed the Royal Docks on the Dragonmere. The docks housed fourteen large vessels, and the Citadel was home to their crew members â€“ over two thousand and five hundred well-trained Blue Dragons. The Crown of Cormyr, a naval palace, was the largest ship as of the late 14 century DR. The Dragon was Suzails mightiest warship armed with ballistae and firepot-hurlers. Some of the smaller and swifter ships stationed in the Citadel were the Blade of Espar and the Lance of Wheloon."
