        "Description": "The Citadel stood in the southeast corner of Suzail, with its gates facing north, toward the city's jail known as [[the Lock-Up]]. It shared the city's massive {{SI|80'|'\"|long=yes}} tall walls.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|65,72}}",
        "Defenses": "The Citadel of the Purple Dragons was under the command of the Lord Magister of the City. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Sthavar]] served as the Lord Magister. Under his control, the garrison of the Purple Dragons was numbered at three hundred patrollers active at a time. Additional barracks were nestled by the city's walls.\n\nThe fortress was also home to the [[Imperial Navy]] and housed the Royal Docks on the Dragonmere. The docks housed fourteen large vessels, and the Citadel was home to their crew members â€“ over two thousand and five hundred well-trained [[Blue Dragons]]. The ''[[Crown of Cormyr]]'', a naval palace, was the largest ship as of the late 14{{th}} century DR. The ''[[Dragon (ship)|Dragon]]'' was Suzail's mightiest warship armed with [[ballista]]e and [[firepot]]-hurlers. Some of the smaller and swifter ships stationed in the Citadel were the ''[[Blade of Espar]]'' and the ''[[Lance of Wheloon]]''."
