'''The Tankard of Eels''' was a tavern in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]], operating around [[1367 DR]].

It took its name from a [[half-ogre]] patron who once drank a tankard of [[eel]]s as a bet. The beverage was later removed from the menu.

It was clean, warm, and pleasant, and sold a good variety of ales, wines, and liquors, including [[zzar]]. Violence was rare here and it was a good place to hear gossip and news from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] area, although there was no official entertainment on offer, nor adornments. It was all talk.
