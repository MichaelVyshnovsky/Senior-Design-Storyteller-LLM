The Tankard of Eels was a tavern in Marsember, Cormyr, operating around 1367 DR.
It took its name from a half-ogre patron who once drank a tankard of eels as a bet. The beverage was later removed from the menu.
It was clean, warm, and pleasant, and sold a good variety of ales, wines, and liquors, including zzar. Violence was rare here and it was a good place to hear gossip and news from the Sea of Fallen Stars area, although there was no official entertainment on offer, nor adornments. It was all talk.
