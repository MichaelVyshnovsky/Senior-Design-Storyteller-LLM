==Interior==
The Red Dragon Tavern had a main big festhall that held numerous tables and a stage for the tavern's evening performance.

The Red Dragon Tavern was the usual gathering place for the residents of Freedale where the working folk could relax, eat, buy a tankard of ale, and enjoy performers on stage.

==Services==
The Red Dragon offered its clients a selection of foods and ales and nightly stage entertainment shows.

==Inhabitants==
The owner of the tavern in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] was [[One-Arm McGinty]] who could be always be found tending the bar, greeting customers, and telling local rumors and tales to his friend and adventurer [[Slinker]].
