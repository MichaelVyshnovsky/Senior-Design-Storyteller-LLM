'''The Generon''' was the palace and the seat of power in the city of [[Arrabar]] and the entire nation of [[Chondath]].

==Location==
The palace was located in the northern half of the Governor's District and in-between the Warehouse District to the west and Living District to the east.

==Structure==
The Generon was the most magnificent and grand edifice that rose above the city of Arrabar. The palace was easily noticeable by its regal glittering gilded domes, marked with [[silver]] and [[gold]]. The Generon's resplendence was probably the most beautiful building along the southern shores of the Vilhon, symbolizing the past glory of the Chondathan Empire.

==Interior==
The palace's ground contained lush green gardens, frequented by the Generon's guests during festivals and noble celebrations. The gardens had several secluded patios that overlooked the beauty of the gardens, a pond, tall [[peach]] trees, fronds, hanging vines, [[plantain]] orchard, and other greenery. The grounds were dimly illuminated by round silver lanterns placed along the balustrades.

In the center of the main entry hall of the Generon stood the fountain of dancing coins, popular attractions for the palace's visitors. Usually, the fountain spewed water but during Waukeenar celebrations, it was enchanted to appear as if wins flowed through it.

==Activities==
The palace belonged to the Lord of Arrabar and all Chondath. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the title was held by [[Eles Wianar]].

The interior of the Generon was decorated with gold and silver&mdash;the color of coins, during the celebrations of [[Sammardach]]. The Lord's House mages enchanted the halls with cascading illusionary golden streamers of light that cascaded periodically through the porches and garden.

Among other customary events in the Generon were regular visits of the city's noble or wealthy and influential guests. These attendances were mandated by Lord Wianar.

==Defenses==
The Generon was encircled by barracks where the Lord of Arrabar housed his personal mercenary army. The interior of the Lord's Palace was shielded from most magical intrusions by the House mages.

==History==
In the [[Flamerule]] of the  {{Yearlink|1372}}, the Lord of Arrabar Eles Wianar hosted his annual gala&mdash;the Night of Ghosts, with most of the city's nobility was in attendance. During the festivities, [[Rodolpho Wianar]], the Lord's cousin, was killed by a [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]. The masked assassin fled the scene of the crime, never to be captured. The only individuals who witnessed the death were members of the [[Matrell|House Matrell]] and young [[Vambran Matrell]] who was thought to be the accidental killer. The youth's aunt, [[Xaphira Matrell]] pretend to be the masked assassin, fleeing the city and keeping her family protected.
