        "mainbody": "A viit was a temporary structure used by iskotuk.\nThe viit was a makeshift shelter used in emergencies or when the regular rissik was insufficient.\nTo construct a viit, two flexible branches, each approximately  long were required. One end of the first branch was secured in the ground, forming an arc shape, and then the second branch was secured perpendicularly to the first, creating a dome-like frame. A long cord was wrapped around the bottom of the frame to prevent the branches from snapping back. The frame was then covered with available skins and blankets. A layer of snow, a few inches thick, was piled around and on top of the frame. An open space was left for entry and ventilation."
