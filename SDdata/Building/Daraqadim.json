After the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]], the keep became the county seat of Calimmon and the home of Her Excellency [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]].\n\nCountess Hawkwinter prefered to call the manor '''The Cliff''', instead of its old [[Alzhedo]] name.",
        "Location": "The keep was located 25 miles directly north of [[Memnon]]. The nearest major Tethyrian city was [[Myratma]], to the north.\n\nAs the countess's name for it suggests, Daraqadim rested on the edge of the coastal cliffs overlooking the [[Sea of Swords]].",
        "Structure": "The Cliff had the typical features of Calishite construction&mdash;large windows and breezeways, spacious balconies, gardens, and halls. Lady Kyrin had her friend Lord [[Zelphar Thann]] design and upgrade the keep's defenses. She also had the stable enlarged for her many horses.<ref>",
