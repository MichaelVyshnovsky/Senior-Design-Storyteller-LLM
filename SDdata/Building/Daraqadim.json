After the Reclamation Wars, the keep became the county seat of Calimmon and the home of Her Excellency Kyrin Hawkwinter.\nCountess Hawkwinter prefered to call the manor The Cliff, instead of its old Alzhedo name.\nThe keep was located 25 miles directly north of Memnon. The nearest major Tethyrian city was Myratma, to the north.\nAs the countesss name for it suggests, Daraqadim rested on the edge of the coastal cliffs overlooking the Sea of Swords.\nThe Cliff had the typical features of Calishite construction&mdashlarge windows and breezeways, spacious balconies, gardens, and halls. Lady Kyrin had her friend Lord Zelphar Thann design and upgrade the keeps defenses.
