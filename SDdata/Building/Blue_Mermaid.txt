The Blue Mermaid was a tavern in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was owned by Mother Jalyth Hlommorath in the mid-1360s DR.
This tavern stood along Ship Street, between Keel Alley and Oar Alley.
Volo described it as a perfectly safe place with perfectly safe patrons, and accordingly he called it "boring".
The tavern was well appointed and clean, if a bit tired.
It was known for good ale and bad wine.
From a dry well in the cellar, a passage known as the Blue Mermaid Passage led down into Skullport.
