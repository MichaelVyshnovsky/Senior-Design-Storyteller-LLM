        "mainbody": "armuths Golden Gauntlet was an inn and festhall located in the town of Tulmon on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 century DR.\nThe establishment derived its name from the large gauntleted hand that stood in the center of the main lobby.\nThe festhall was frequented mostly by Tulmons working class, so brawls often broke out during the various dances. Patrons could use private suites to enjoy a more peaceful evening. Order and security was maintained by a staff of ex-adventurers."
