The '''Dragon Defeated''' was an inn in [[Halfknot]]. It was renamed the '''Royal Rescue''' after [[Petra (painter)|Petra's]] visit in {{yearlink|1362}}.

==Location==
The inn was in [[Halfknot]], a town within [[Sembia]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|22}}

==Services==
The place served beer, and food, including rat meat pies.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|25}}

Through the second half of {{yearlink|1362}}, the owner, [[Varney]], organized a contest where every customer could drop a single coin in a jar to tell an anecdote about [[dragon]]s, which would be judged by three locals: [[Wyrmbait Nix]], [[Badger Bates]], and [[Silvenestri Silver]]. The best story every night got to keep the whole jar.

After the winter of {{yearlink|1362}}, the Dragon Defeated was renamed the Royal Rescue, and bards were hired to tell stories about royalty.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1362}}, the owner, Varney, accepted the offer of [[Petra]], a wandering artist, to paint him a new sign. He requested the new sign have three regulars at his tavern, Wyrmbait Nix, Silvenestri Silver, and Badger Bates, as heroes defeating a dragon and saving a princess.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|26}} Later, the owner started a nightly contest where people would tell of their exploits with dragons.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|27}} The last night this contest was held, the painter, Petra, painted a painting of [[Malaeragoth]], who appeared and destroyed the tavern, killing Badger Bates; only the sign survived, with all but the princess broken beyond repair.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|37-38}}

Varney repaired and reopened the tavern later, renamed the "Royal Rescue", but some other calamity befell it later.{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Woman Who Drew Dragons|39}}
