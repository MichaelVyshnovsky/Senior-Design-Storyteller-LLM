Roaringcrest was a ruined keep once used by pirates on the isle of Raerest in Sea of Swords, just off the shores of Candlekeep.
Roaringcrest built on a natural harbor on Raerests southeastern side, on the southern shores of the islands freshwater lake chain.
By the late 14 century DR, Roaringcrest was a ruin reclaimed by vegetation.
Long time before the late 14 century DR, Roaringcrest was a pirate stronghold, until its destruction at the hands of the Twilight Three, a trio of liches from the isle of Thelve. The liches pelted the keep with spells that turned it into an area of wild magic. After the pirate occupants, the ruins were home to crimson deaths, darktentacles and automatons. Even by the late 14 century DR, pirates of the Sea of Swords told stories of ancient buccaneer treasures hidden within Roaringcrest.
