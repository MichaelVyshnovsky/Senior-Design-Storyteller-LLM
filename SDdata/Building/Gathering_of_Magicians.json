        "mainbody": "The Gathering of Magicians was a school located in the city of Heldapan in Durpar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe school focused on teaching young mages the nature of magic. The Gathering of Magicians was a favored place for illusionists to go to learn the ways of their craft. Given the acceptance of magic in Durparian society, the school was exceedingly popular, and a prospective student usually had to be on the waiting list for several years before being admitted. Money, of course, could speed this process up considerably."
