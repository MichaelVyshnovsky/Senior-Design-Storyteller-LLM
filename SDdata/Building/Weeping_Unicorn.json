It was oft-used to do business by villainous sorts.\nThe house rule was strictly \"no fighting\", which all patrons obeyed, as those who didnt tended to run into a cockatrice. Their petrified forms adorned the cellar.\nCategoryInns\nCategoryTaverns\nCategoryLocations in Calaunt\nCategoryLocations in the Vast\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nd4rwrsez719j9pc5se3rm20xvb1rycn"
