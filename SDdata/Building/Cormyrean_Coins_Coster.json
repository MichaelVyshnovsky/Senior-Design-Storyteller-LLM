        "mainbody": "The '''Cormyrean Coins Coster''', known as the '''\"Coiners\"''', was a [[business]] located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was a [[coster]] involved in shipping and warehousing.",
        "Defenses": "The coster's facilities were usually well guarded by veteran [[warrior]]s and [[mage]]s employed by the Coiners.",
        "History": "The Cormyrean Coins Coster was founded in Wheloon and was in business by [[1358 DR]]. They were a small but fast-growing company, and aggressively competitive, being known to get into conflicts—and winning—against older, larger costers and even against [[Zhentarim]] agents.\n\nBy around [[1369 DR]], the Coiners had twice been caught smuggling cut [[gem]]s and [[jewelry]] inside hollowed-out vegetables. The [[Purple Dragons]] of Wheloon thus kept a close watch on their activities.\n\nFamed traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] wrote about the Cormyrean Coins Coster in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]''.\n\nFollowing continued efforts to smuggle jewels inside vegetables, operations were shut down in [[Eleasias]] of [[1374 DR]], while the Coiners sorted out their legal problems.",
        "Operation": "The Cormyrean Coins Coster was a shipping business based in Wheloon. It operated in all ports of Cormyr and [[Sembia]], and had routes to [[Ilipur]], [[Teziir]], and [[Westgate]]. The Coiners used small, fast coastal boats over the sea and wagons throughout Cormyr and Sembia.\n\nThe coster's primary business, and the one that made the most legitimate profits, was importing and exporting perishable goods. This included foodstuffs such as fruit and vegetables, which they supplied to restaurants. However, they also repeatedly smuggled gems and jewelry inside hollowed-out vegetables, which often got them into legal trouble.\n\nThe Cormyrean Coins Coster was led by a former adventuring group, and had a proud and aggressive attitude. The Coiners fought with, and wiped out, those who disrupted their trade, including older, larger costers and even Zhentarim agents.",
