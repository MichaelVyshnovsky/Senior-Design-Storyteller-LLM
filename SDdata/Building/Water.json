        "mainbody": "The element of water was one of the four fundamental building blocks of matter and the source of all fluidity, essential for life, liable to transformations but cyclically reverting to its basic liquid nature.\nWater manifested its position in the cosmos as the Elemental Plane of Water, one of the Inner Planes. The element was also represented there in living form as water elementals.\nThe ruler over the portfolio of water in Faer√ªn and Zakhara was the elemental lord Istishia. The archomental Olhydra also proclaimed her wish to dominate the element by calling herself Princess of Evil Water, though she had made no obvious attempts to challenge the Water Lord.Monte Cook (1998). [http//www.dnd-wiki.org/wiki/PublicationPlanescape_Monstrous_Compendium_Appendix_III Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix III]. (TSR, Inc), p. 17. ISBN 0-7869-0751-7.\nA number Torilian powers were concerned less directly with the elemental aspect of water, but with its various appearances in the Realms Deep Sashelas, Umberlee, Ulutiu and Valkur with the sea and oceans Isis, Sebek and Shajar with rivers Aerdrie Faenya, Anhur, Azul and Jisan with rain and Eldath with springs, pools, and waterfalls.\nMany magical spells utilized the element of water. Elemental water was recognized as a \"school of effect\" (rather than one of the eight traditional schools of magic). Wizards specializing in this school were called water elementalists.In some areas of the world of Mystara, water elementalists were called hydromancers.\nWater was opposed to the element of fire, both as a school of magic and as a worldview.\nMagic-users in Zakhara had a similar but not identical notion of water magic in the form of the province of sea.\nLikewise, the wu jen of Kara-Tur divided spells into five elemental groups, including water.\nA number of deities granted divine spells that relied on the element, either in the form of the elemental water sphere, or the water domain.\nSpacefarers also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the crystal spheres.\nMajor water bodies in Realmspace were\n* Karpri\n* Chandos\n* HCatha"
