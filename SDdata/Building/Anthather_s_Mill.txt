Anthathers Mill was a water mill somewhere in Faer√ªn.
Anthathers Mill stood over a fork in the road. The land around it was largely farmlands, broken up by large stones.
The building was made of fieldstone, and had a pool where the stream that turned its wheel was dammed. The pool continued along one of the roads.
Flour was made there.
A Chosen of Mystra, Elminster Aumar, asked for directions at Anthathers Mill when looking for the Riven Stone, learning it was just down the road from there.
