The '''Laughing Goblin Inn''' was not necessarily [[Phlan|Phlan's]] fanciest inn, but the inn was definitely Phlan's busiest.

==History==
One busy night in [[1340 DR]], [[Ren o' the Blade]] challenged three female [[human]] [[fighter]]s to lift and carry a serving tray from their table to the bar, but the tray turned out to be an old heavy [[shield]] and the [[ranger]] tricked [[Salen]], [[Jensena]], and [[Gwen]] out of a bagful of [[gold]]. Later, Ren stopped working at the Laughing Goblin Inn when he was sent to [[Sokol Keep]] on [[Thorn Island]] out in the [[Bay of Phlan]] with his friends, [[Shal Desanea|Shal Bal]] of [[Cormyr]] and [[Tarl Desanea]] of [[Vaasa]].

==Geography==
The inn was located in the city of Phlan, which was on the northwestern coast of the [[Moonsea]]. The inn was located in the heart of the town in the civilized portion that was not over run by evil humanoid monsters like [[kobold]]s, [[goblin]]s, and [[orc]]s.

==Structure==
Outside the inn, a stable was located to cover travelers' horses and above the stable was a loft used by Ren, the barkeeper. Over the entrance, a carved wooden sign displayed a grinning goblin's head.

===Interior===
The double doors entered into the great room of the tavern. The room had a bar, many round tables, a pantry for storage, a doorway to the kitchen, and stairs leading upwards to the rooms above the tavern. Many patrons believe the inn offered safe, if a bit overpriced, lodging. At one end of the tavern, a great round slab from a gigantic pine hung on the wall which was used for knife/[[dagger]] throwing contests.

==Inhabitants==
;[[Ren o' the Blade]]: The barkeeper at the inn.

;[[Sot]]: Innkeeper of the establishment known for his pork and cabbage soup.
