'''The Sign of the Silver Sword''' was an inn in [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The inn was located in Berdusk's market quarter area, along the main road that entered the city via its southeastern gate.

==Interior==
The inn was large and well-built, with lush soundproof carpeting throughout and [[driftglobe]]s used as lighting within the rooms. The place was extremely quiet, but well-furnished. Guest rooms each contained a bath, a writing table, a canopied bed, and a soft easy chair. Each room also had privacy bars that could be placed to block doors and windows from within.

==Services==

Aside from lush living arrangements, the inn provided food of fair quality, often using very fresh ingredients sourced from the [[River Chionthar]]. However, service itself was almost nonexistent, with the staff speaking little and taking long periods of time to fulfill requests from guests.
