        "mainbody": "he Ringed Nose was a tavern in East Sabban of Keltar that was a good place to discuss secrets.\nThe tavern was one of the more \"seedy\" bars in East Sabban. It was situated amongst the slaughterhouses of that district, and thus the stench was usually terrible, no matter how good the food being served there might actually smell. It was a place frequented by the butchers of the city, and most nights the half-orc staff had to work hard to contain the fights that broke out among the patrons.\nDespite its poor location and the frequency of brawling, this dive was actually a fitting place to tell secrets the bartenders were discreet and most people got so drunk they were not likely to remember any conversations they might have overheard.\nCategoryTaverns\nCategoryLocations in Keltar\nCategoryLocations in Calimshan\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n4zar368nyxd3trcpngpqs8pi1it73ng"
