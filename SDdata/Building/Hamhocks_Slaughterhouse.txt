The Hamhocks Slaughterhouse was a massive compound composed of a number of animal pens, knackeries and butcheries in the Sows Foot district of Baldurs Gate.The Murder in Baldurs Gate Dungeon Masters screen shows the slaughterhouse as being in the middle of the Sows Foot district, but the more recent Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus explicitly states it is in Stonyeyes.
The establishment had a mixed relationship with the surrounding neighborhood. While their location was convenient to local butchers, the odor drove away the animals of the herders and wranglers.
As expected, Hamhocks was covered in the stench of animal blood.
Some time around the , the owner of Hamhocks Slaughterhouse was killed by members of the Cult of the Dead Three and supplanted by their leader, Pasque Enrial. The group began to use the slaughterhouse as their headquarters, while committing horrific murders around the city.
