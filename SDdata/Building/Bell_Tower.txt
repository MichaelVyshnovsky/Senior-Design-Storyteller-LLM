The Bell Tower served as an alarm system for the city of Manass in Khazari in 1367 DR.
The tower stood in the southwest corner of the city. This tower was much smaller and less elaborate than the Drum Tower. 
The Bell Tower only served to warn the residents of Manass of fires. Though all of the buildings in Manass were made from stone or brick, each household stored their firewood on the roof, increasing the potential for dangerous fire to occur.
