'''Winn's Ice House''' was an icehouse business in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] owned by the [[wizard]] [[Darra Winn]].

==Location==
This building was located on the corner of [[Black Visor Street]] and [[Flask Circle]], in the [[Anvil (neighborhood)|Anvil]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] district.{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Structure==
Much like the business's prior home,{{Cite polyhedron/53/The Living City: The Ice House|28}} a series of cool subterannean caverns beneath the building were used for the storing of its ice.

==Services==
This business created and stored ice through the use of [[spell]]s, which it then sold. Most of this ice was cut during the winter season and stored in its underground caverns, packed compactly into [[cask]]s specially made by a local cooper to be insulated with [[sawdust]].Some exact prices and details of the operation of this store were not provided in ''[[The City of Ravens Bluff]]'' but, due to some similarities between it and Darra Winn's previous store, this article assumes that Winn's Ice House runs relatively the same as The Ice House.

The store made most of its profit by supplying ice to elite inns, restauraunts, noble households, and private clubs, and the offices maintained by the city's knightly orders. Having contracts with many of them to deliver ice to their doors each morning.<ref group="note" name="price" /> Winn's Ice House also provided ice in bulk to various fishmongers in the city. They delivered ice by means of wagons full of sawdust and hay.

A side business of Winn's Ice House during the hotter months was to sell flavored versions of its chipped ice, which had been chipped through use of the ''[[shatter]]'' spell. These cost two [[copper piece]]s, plus a three copper deposit for the returnable, [[earthenware]] [[cup]]s and [[spoon]]s they were served in.<ref group="note" name="price" /> The treat was popular among both children and [[halfling]]s in the city.

==History==
Formerly belonging to an establishment known as [[Healthier Living]], this building was bought and renamed by Darra Winn some time before [[1370 DR]] after her previous shop, [[the Ice House]], had burned to the ground and forced her to relocate.

==Inhabitants==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this establishment was run by Darra Winn and her three daughters.

==Rumors & Legends==
Much like their prior establishment, Winn's Ice House was the victim of some local rumors. In the case of this establishment, there were rumors that its underground caverns were occasionally used to keep cool things besides ice, such as bodies awaiting staged "deaths."
