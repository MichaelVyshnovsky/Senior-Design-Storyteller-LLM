The '''Three Trees Inn''' was an inn that stood in the center of the town of [[Nonthal]] in [[Turmish]] and was the busiest establishment in town.

==Location==
The main source of entertainment and the famed feature that attracted clients to the Three Trees Inn was a small path behind its building. The path was a dangerous and [[enchanted]] way known as [[Nonthal's Path]] that led towards the infamous and magically hidden [[Nonthal's Hold]]. The path led to a simple [[dung]]-pit to an unwitting observer, but it was just a clever disguise. Mysterious [[wizard]] [[Nonthal]] hid his lair behind a trapped path, each third set of which was one of the ''[[13 Gates of Magic]]''. Each of the thirteen teleported travelers across [[Faer√ªn]].

Countless adventurers paid for lodgings at the inn and tested their luck walking Nonthal's Path. Even more inn customers stayed there and watched the adventurers trying to get to the fabled magical treasure, gambling on adventures' fates.

==History==
Nonthal's Hold was created sometime ''circa'' [[1170 DR]] and quickly gained popularity among fortune seekers. A map that detailed the whereabouts of Nonthal's magical treasure was left behind and later was proudly displayed in the Three Trees Inn to inspire more unwitting adventurers to walk through the ''13 Gates of Magic''.

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the entire inn was rebuilt to better feature the view of Nonthal's Path and all those trying their luck. ''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, one of the adventures who tried his luck and failed was a wizard named [[Fern (wizard)|Fern]]. After his failed attempt, he found his way back to the Three Trees Inn and observed others attempting the feat.
