The Stag at Rest was a dark and quiet tavern in the settlement of Kheldell that catered to the towns loggers and woodsmen in the midâ€“14 century DR. At the end of a long day of work, the Stag was full of townsfolk gossiping about the world outside their town, especially regarding the local exploits that were going on in the great, nearby city of Waterdeep.
The tavern was run by an elderly woman named Delgara the Slim.
A meal cost 2 silver pieces, and consisted of bread, gravy, and meat, typically bear, venison, or boar customers could have as much meat as they wanted. However, a serving of vegetables was 2 sp, owing to their rarity in town. Glasses of sugar water were free and readily available, tankards of stout were 3 cp and tankards of ale were 2 cp.
Space to sleep at the tavern was free of charge, assuming there was still space in a room or on the back porch.
