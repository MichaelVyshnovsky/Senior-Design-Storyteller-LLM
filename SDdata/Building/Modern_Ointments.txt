'''Modern Ointments''' was a wellness shop in the [[Flask Circle]] market of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|9}}

==Structure==
The interior of this shop had a counter and was lined with many display cases. These were filled with many small [[jar]]s, tins, and rolled-up [[paper]]s.

==Services==
Modern Ointments primarily sold various [[candle]]s, [[lotion]]s, aromatic [[oil]]s, bathing oils, [[incense]], [[cologne]] and [[perfume]], packets of [[bath salt]]s, and foot powder. Though the shop also carried some [[magic]]al oils, powders, and dusts.

One special item offered by the shop was what the proprietor [[Jarwahlmin]] referred to as a "starter kit", selling for 10 [[gold piece]]s. These consisted of two cones of [[strawberry]] scented incense, a packet of bath salts, foot powder, a small [[vial]] of either cologne or perfume, and a small [[glass]] pyramid that he claimed would help individuals to focus when meditating. In actuality, these glass pyramids held no such magical effect, but the proprietor was convinced that they did.

==History==
Around the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the [[alchemist]] [[Wendell]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3-4}} When they entered Modern Ointments they enquired about obtaining some ''[[aroma of dreams]]'' and ''[[powder of coagulation]]'' on his behalf. Jarwahlmin was willing to sell both to the party of adventurers in return for either 950 gold pieces or the pair of [[diamond]] [[earring]]s that Wendell had given them to barter with. If he was offered the latter, Jarwahlmin tried to convince the adventurers to buy one of his "starter kits," hoping it could lead to them becoming regular customers in the future.
