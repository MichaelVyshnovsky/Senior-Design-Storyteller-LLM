The '''White Spire''' was a school of [[magic|arcane study]] found in [[Kourmira]] in [[1375 DR]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste}}

==Activities==
The Spire was the only dedicated place within Kourmira where aspiring [[wizard]]s could learn and hone their craft.

==Inhabitants==
Skilled wizards from [[Faerûn]] were recruited to head the academy. Given the distrust of magic prevalent among the [[Tuigan]], many of the initial students attending the White Spire were women who wanted to break away from the mundane traditional lifestyles they had as nomads.
