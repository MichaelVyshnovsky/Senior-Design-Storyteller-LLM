The White Spire was a school of arcane study found in Kourmira in 1375 DR.
The Spire was the only dedicated place within Kourmira where aspiring wizards could learn and hone their craft.
Skilled wizards from Faer√ªn were recruited to head the academy. Given the distrust of magic prevalent among the Tuigan, many of the initial students attending the White Spire were women who wanted to break away from the mundane traditional lifestyles they had as nomads.
