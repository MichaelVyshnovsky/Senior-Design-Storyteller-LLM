She inspired attending adventurers and [[Purple Dragons]] soldiers with sermons of battle, blood, and fire. She offered her healing only to those wounded in battle, and would confirm the truth of a tale before she started.\n\nThe shrine was a stone building decorated all over with the detritus of war: split helms, broken shields, blood-stained armor, shattered swords, and the skulls of the fallen."
