}}The '''Halfway Inn'''<ref> was a tavern and inn located in the mountains near [[Evereska]] that was constructed for the elves to trade with the other races.

==Description==
The Halfway Inn was located on the northwestern border of [[Evereska]], a ride of an hour or two away from the city of Evereska. The proprietor in [[1361 DR]] was named [[Myrin Silverspear]].

The inn had an associated stable. The front of the stable opened up on to a busy, well-lit street. The back door opened up to a path that led into the forest behind the inn. It sold a variety of [[elf|elven]] spirits known as [[Elquesstria]].
