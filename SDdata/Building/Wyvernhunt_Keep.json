        "mainbody": "'''Wyvernhunt Keep''' was a stronghold or fortalice in the foothills of the [[Storm Horns]] mountains of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Location": "It was built into the side of a rocky slope, overlooking the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] and near the hamlet of [[Wyvernhunt]].",
        "Defenses": "The name was wildly exaggeratedâ€”Wyvernhunt Keep was not much more than a large one-room. The roof and walls facing down the slope created a high-walled platform, where lookouts and archers could watch the ground below. It was surrounded by crumbling ramparts. It was counted as a ruin in the mid-1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "Wyvernhunt Keep was originally used by brigands and was one of the bases of the forces of [[Gondegal]], the so-called Lost King, during his uprising in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}.\n\nBy the 1360s DR, however, the [[Purple Dragons]] were uninterested in garrisoning it. Instead, travelers commonly used it for shelter, this being one of the few reasons to stop in Wyvernhunt."
