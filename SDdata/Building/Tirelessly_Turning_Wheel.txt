The Tirelessly Turning Wheel was a shop in the city of Waterdeep in 1370 DR that sold various curios from all across Faer√ªn.
This shop was located along Julthoon Street, in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
The building housing this shop stood three stories tall.
This shop sold a variety of different curios, some of them quite fragile and irreplaceable.
This business was owned by the elven couple Jhanathe and Ormsiir Mrhulaedir. They lived in the business with their son, Oenel Mrhulaedir, who sometimes accidentally broke curios with his stocky builds passing.
