The Shrine to Tsikapasmatra was a small temple dedicated to an ancient hero of Khazari, Tsikapasmatra. The shrine was located in the city of Manass.
In 1367 DR, the shrine was tended by a trio of old shukenja. The Yellow Mountain Sect did not bother the attendants since the shrine was so small.
Locals believed that anyone seeking courage could offer a generous donation and maintain vigil overnight on the shrines steps to find what they sought.
