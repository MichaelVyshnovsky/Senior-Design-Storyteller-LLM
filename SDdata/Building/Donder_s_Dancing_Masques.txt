'''Donder's Dancing Masques''', also known as the '''Tavern of the Masques''' was a hot, unruly, and loud tavern in [[Tharkar]] of the [[Free Cities of Parsanic]]. The tavern served strong drinks, comfort food, and was often filled with sailors and pirates.

{{quote|''The Masques was a chaos of splintering furniture, screams, breaking glass, oaths, and flailing fists. Bunkmates and men who were utter strangers were pounding each other for no reason at all but the drink and the pent-up anger of desperate men who spend their days in danger and discomfort and see a ready foe to lash out at.''|The excerpt from [[The Mercenaries]]}}

==Structure==
The Tavern of the Masques had a swirling carved signboard banner that hung on top of the main entrance, the sign read "Donder's Dancing Masques".

The sprawling building of Donder's Dancing Masques stood in the overgrowth of [[tallgrass]] and had a spacious taproom with a copper-topped bar. A large smoky hearth took over one end of the taproom. The doors to the kitchen were wide open, radiating heavy heat, steam, and aromas into the taproom. The kitchen was filled with vats of hot spiced fat and countless chopping board.

==Atmosphere==
The hot taproom was often full to the brim, loud, busy with sweating rowdy pirates and regulars. The main room was roaring with cackling, loud voices, sea shanties, and arguments. The raucous could e defining to the folk who was not used to such places.

The smell inside the tavern was an interesting mixture of cooking food, spilled [[ale]], pipe [[tobacco]], and sweat.

==Staff==
Even though the place was called Donder's Dancing Masques, by [[1377 DR]] none inside remembered [[Donder]] himself. The main gate was manned with muscular hired guards who tried their best to keep order and made sure the guests of the Masques left their arms in the weapon-check rooms. When very common bar fights broke out, the guards were ready to summon the [[Daggers of Tharkar]], the group that passed for the local law enforcement.

The cooks in the hellishly hot kitchen wore only one article of clothing - a side-towel wrapped around their foreheads to stop the abundant sweating from getting into their eyes.

The waitresses wore thin leather strips with bells to announce their presence and skillfully dodged greedy hands, flirted with the clients, and balanced trays of foods and libations. They wore leather leg-bags to stuff with tipped coins. In [[1377 DR]] one of that waitresses was a priestess of [[Umberlee]] who wore a garb of [[seaweed]] and was free from harassment of the sea-faring folks.

==Services==
The kitchen served deeply satisfying comfort fare, greasy sizzling stuffed [[boar]], roasted [[almond]]s, fried [[mushroom]]s in [[herb]] [[butter]], [[stagshead soup]], and roasted poultry in rich [[wine]] sauce.

The main star of the Tavern of the Masques was plentiful alcohol served to the thirsty crowds. The guests could find the most exotic bottles from across the world, from the brewers of legendary and obscure names. The bartenders masterfully mixed drinks with various additives, [[dye]]s, and [[sugar]]s to quench the thirsty clientele. Most of the pirates and sailors were more than happy to drink anything that could be served to them.

==Patronage==
The Masques was infamous for its clientele that often consisted of pirates that called Tharkar their home port. Almost all residents and visitors of Tharkar came to the Masques to eat, drink, share stories, and boast about their adventurers. The locals tended to clear out when the sea dogs'ships came into the harbor. 

==History==
In [[1377 DR]], [[Belmer Droon]] visited the Tavern of the Masques in search of a group of experienced hirelings to find and assassinate [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]] for reasons he kept to himself. He was able to find a group of seven Sharkers, of the recently destroyed ''[[Kissing Shark]]'' ship of a known pirate [[Blackfingers Ralingor]]. Shortly after a usual brawl broke out, Belmer helped the Sharkers to avoid city guards and set them on their mission.
