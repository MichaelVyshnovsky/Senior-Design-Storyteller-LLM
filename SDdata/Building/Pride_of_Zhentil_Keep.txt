The '''Pride of Zhentil Keep''', which was also simply called '''the Pride'''

==Location==
The tavern was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on the south bank of the [[River Tesh]]. The tavern sat in the western section of the quarter near the [[South Force Gate]] at the intersection of [[Zhent Avenue]], [[Teshwave Street]], [[Center Street]], and [[Twilight Street]].

==Description==
The Pride of Zhentil Keep was rumored to be so dirty that even the chamberpots leaked. Occupants of the inn were usually cold because of the poorly insulated walls. [[Volothamp Geddarm]] even described the Pride as "one of the ten worst locales of any kind in the Realms."

==Activities==
Brawls broke out on a nightly basis here. Despite the rowdy conditions in the common room, the Pride hired sellswords to guards the guests upstairs, ensuring they received a restful night's sleep.

==Inhabitants==
The Pride was run by a [[half-orc]] innkeep named [[Berk]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.
