The '''Unrolling Scroll''' was a shrine of [[Oghma]], located in the [[Upper City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was a popular destination for Baldurian weddings, ceremonies or other formal recitations.

==Description==
The building was constructed out of white marble and featured a striking red roof with gold leaf trim. Beneath the roof was a reflecting pool set into a rather deep basin.

The roof itself was constructed with remarkable acoustics, ensuring that any words spoken around the reflecting pool resounded for all to hear.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was believed that any [[bard]] or other artist that examined their reflection within the pool, for at least half a day, would receive a vision from Oghma himself.

==History==
The shrine was established sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1358}},
 and remained standing throughout the 15{{th}} century, until at least the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
