'''Fairfortune Hall''' was a shrine to [[Tymora]] in [[Daggerford]].

==Location==
Fairfortune Hall was located near the [[Caravan Gate]] on [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] along the northern perimeter of the drill field.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Inhabitants==
[[Bando|Bando the Lame]] led the Hall ''circa'' [[1366 DR]].

[[Curran Corvalin]] managed the Hall around [[1485 DR]]. He paid the [[Clan Ironeater]] dwarves to rebuild it in grander style.

==Trivia==
Those who so much as touched the [[silver]] goblet meant for the goddess herself at the [[Lady Luck Tavern]] were forced by outraged staff to make a sizeable offering at Fairfortune Hall.<ref>
