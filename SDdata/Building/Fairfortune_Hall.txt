Fairfortune Hall was a shrine to Tymora in Daggerford.
Fairfortune Hall was located near the Caravan Gate on Wall Street along the northern perimeter of the drill field.
Bando the Lame led the Hall circa 1366 DR.
Curran Corvalin managed the Hall around 1485 DR. He paid the Clan Ironeater dwarves to rebuild it in grander style.
Those who so much as touched the silver goblet meant for the goddess herself at the Lady Luck Tavern were forced by outraged staff to make a sizeable offering at Fairfortune Hall.
