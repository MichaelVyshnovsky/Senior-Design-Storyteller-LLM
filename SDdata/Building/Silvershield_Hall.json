The ground level housed the main taproom, with offices and storage on the floor above and the brewery built into the converted cellar.\nArrak Mithrose was the owner of Silvershield Hall, one of the few dwarves who ran a business within the city. He employed a staff made up entirely of other dwarves along with some humans."
