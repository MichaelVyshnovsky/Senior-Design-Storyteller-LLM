'''Spear Rock''' was a famous shrine to [[Tempus]], Lord of Battles, standing in the western [[Storm Horns]] mountains of [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
It stood on a knoll in the foothills of the mountains, several fields up the slope above the hamlet of [[Wyvernhunt]], and not far from the so-called [[Wyvernhunt Keep]]. It could be clearly sighted from the hamlet, and a strong archer here could land an arrow in its market area.

==Structure==
The shrine was rough, comprising a standing stone that was Spear Rock itself and beside a flat stone called the Shield Stone, which served as an altar table.

==Activities==
Despite its crude nature, Spear Rock was regularly visited both by lone warriors and priests of Tempus all through the year. The latter cleansed the place and tidied up or collected old offering.

==Defenses==
By its position and powers, it was an excellent platform for archers.

==Legends==
The faithful believed Tempus listened attentively to prayers made here. Sometimes, if he liked the prayer, he even answered back from the Shield Stone, giving the location of an enemy named in the prayer. Typically, this was as laconic and wide-ranging as "[[Suzail]]" or "[[Sembia]]", but on some occasions as precise "north of the [[Hill of Lost Souls]]". This had happened several times in the mid-1300s, according to reliable reports.

The [[church of Tempus]] attested that several of the faithful who'd prayed at Spear Rock prior to a battle saw their foes smote by bolts of lightning from out of clear skies.

Moreover, a local legend held that an archer faithful to Tempus who stood at the shrine could not miss with [[bow]] or [[crossbow]]. [[Elminster]] observed this was a slight exaggeration, clarifying any missile weapon was substantially more accurate when used within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} of the Shield Stone. In any case, it was a fine place for a desperate archer to make a heroic last stand.

==History==
Such stands happened at least twice in its history before [[1367 DR]]. In one, an outlaw known as [[Saeragus the Sly]] was trapped at Spear Rock by a [[Purple Dragons]] patrol and managed to take down every one of them with his bow and [[arrow]]s.
