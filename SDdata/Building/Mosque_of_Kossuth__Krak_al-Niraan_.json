        "mainbody": "he Mosque of Kossuth was a temple dedicated to the cold elemental god of fire within the fortress of Krak al-Niraan in the Weeping Desert in 1367 DR.\nThe air within the mosque was heavy with incense emanating from five flaming braziers located in each corner and the vaulted center.\nA large brazier decorated the center of the mosque. The brazier was actually a brazier of commanding fire elementals usable only by skilled flame mages or holy slayers devoted to Kossuth.\nMany of the Brotherhood of the True Flame within Krak al-Niraan, including the fanatical fedayeen of the Flamedeath Fellowship, came to the mosque to worship Kossuth.\nSince the mosque was strongly connected to the Elemental Plane of Fire, any flame-based attack within the mosque was enhanced."
