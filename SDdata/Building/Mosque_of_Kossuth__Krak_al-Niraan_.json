        "Description": "The air within the mosque was heavy with incense emanating from five flaming braziers located in each corner and the vaulted center.\n\nA large brazier decorated the center of the mosque. The brazier was actually a ''[[brazier of commanding fire elementals]]'' usable only by skilled [[Elemental mage|flame mages]] or [[holy slayer]]s devoted to Kossuth.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] within Krak al-Niraan, including the fanatical [[Midani dictionary|fedayeen]] of the [[Flamedeath Fellowship]], came to the mosque to worship Kossuth.",
        "Defenses": "Since the mosque was strongly connected to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], any [[Flame (province)|flame]]-based attack within the mosque was enhanced."
