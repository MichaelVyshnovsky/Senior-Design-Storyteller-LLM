In the late 15 century DR, the tavern had a large blazing hearth by one of the taprooms walls and a small stage for bards and minstrels to perform for the guests.\nTrip and Shuffle served a homey stew of meat, potatoes, and carrots, accompanied by ale, in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the early 1370s DR, the Trip and Shuffle was operated by a man named Russell, who was living in Targos to escape a death sentence that hed received in Cormyr as a disgraced Purple Dragon.\nIn the late 1480s DR, the ex-Harper bard and struggling single father Edgin Darvis went to the Trip and Shuffle for a bowl of stew, a tankard of ale, and milk for his infant daughter, Kira, but nodded off to sleep with the cooing baby next to him. When he woke, he found Holga Kilgore cradling Kira after shed kept an eye on the newborn and let the father get some sleep. Though he briefly reacted badly, fearing a stranger taking his child, the two became firm friends. In the years after, the Trip and Shuffle tavern became the favored haunt of the thieves Edgin, Holga, Kira, Simon Aumar, and Forge Fitzwilliam, a place where they would plan, celebrate, and make music.\nIn the mid-1490s DR, they were met here by Sofina, who hired them to rob Korinns Keep. After their crimes caught up with them, in the late 1490s DR, Edgin and Holga escaped the Revels End prison and returned to Targos. They had a drink at the Trip and Shuffle to discuss their plans, though the barkeep mistook them for a married couple, which they were amused and offended by. Finding a flyer advertising the High Sun Games and that Forge had become Lord of Neverwinter, they departed for that city."
