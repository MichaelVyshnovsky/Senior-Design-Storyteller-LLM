Ropes for All Uses was a shop located in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Ropes for All Uses carried an assortment of standard ropes, both practical and ornamental.
One specialty rope carried by the shop made it much more difficult to escape from if the rope was used as binding. Focran Samina made these ropes himself and only had three in the store for sale at any given time. They usually sold for double the asking price.
Focran owned and operated this establishment.
