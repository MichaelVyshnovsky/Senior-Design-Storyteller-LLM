The '''Fatted Bookworm''' was a business in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
The Fatted Bookworm was a two-story building in deteriorating condition.

==Services==
The Fatted Bookworm served as a unique purveyor of rare [[book]]s, [[scroll]]s, and high-quality writing materials within Skullport. The shop was renowned for its collection of tomes, [[parchment]], [[vellum]], and expertly bound volumes, all offered at premium prices.

==Inhabitants==
The Fatted Bookworm was owned by [[Velara Lillianyth]], a [[human]] [[mage]]. Velara’s reputation ensured steady business, regardless of the presence of her occasional shop clerk, [[Amryyr Yauntyrr]]. Amryyr, a [[drow]] [[wizard]] and [[thief]], utilized the shop as a base when in Skullport, dealing in rare texts, trading valuable information, and facilitating discreet item transfers between Skullport and other parts of the [[Underdark]]. Velara, who outwardly expressed little interest in Amryyr’s activities, allowed him to operate within her shop due to an obligation to his associate, [[Malakuth Tabuirr]], a drow [[slaver]]. When Amryyr was present, the Fatted Bookworm occasionally handled highly coveted items, including rare magical texts, arcane scrolls, and, on rare occasions, [[spellbook]]s.
