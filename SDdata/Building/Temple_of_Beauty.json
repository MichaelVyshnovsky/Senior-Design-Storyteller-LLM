This ship was meant to deliver a load of precious statuary to the Temple of Beauty, but it mysteriously sank just south of the city. Unbeknownst to them, the sinking of the Goddess Glory was caused by Kerritas Reefsilver, a member of the Cult of Ao, and two merfolk. They pilfered the statuary to place in a small temple to Deep Sashelas, situated in an underwater reef just outside of the Deepwater Harbor.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, this temple was led by the High Priestess Ssaeryl Shadowstar."
