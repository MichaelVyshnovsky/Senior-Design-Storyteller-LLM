The Merchant House was a trade outpost in the town of Mossbridges run by the Company of the Ravens in the late 14 century DR.
The Merchant House run trade in Mossbridges, doing business with local producers and businesses, including purchasing goods from local trappers, Borin, Golin, and Chad, as well as doing business with exotic spice dealers, such as Silas Billmore of Mulmaster.
In the late 14 century DR, the Company of the Ravens was still establishing itself in the Vast and figuring out its overall organization, leaning the Merchant House to run itself and the Mossbridges trade. Occasionally, the Merchant House gave shelter and contact to adventurers of the Living City, who were affiliated with the Company of the Ravens.
