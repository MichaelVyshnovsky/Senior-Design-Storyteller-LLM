        "mainbody": "The Flagon Held High was a tavern in Tilverton in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe Flagon was located in the eastern part of the Old Town on the hilltop, towards the end of Phorns Lane.\nThe Flagon was something of an ongoing festival, where people of all types came to meet, drink, and eat.\nThe Flagon provided a wide selection of fine beers and fine entertainment, with professional joke-tellers, dancers, minstrels, escorts, and thieves working the patrons. Easy-going Purple Dragons watched the outgoing crowds each night, directing lost and befuddled customers back to their lodgings.\nA fire around 1367 DR resulted in the tavern being rebuilt and renovated, with the cellars supplied by a winch-tunnel that ran from Drakar Lane below the Old Town knoll."
