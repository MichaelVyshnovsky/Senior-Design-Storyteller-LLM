The '''Northern Light''' was an inn in [[Caer-Konig]], where travelers typically stayed in-between making a journey to [[Easthaven]], [[Bryn Shander]], or [[Kelvin's Cairn]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|47}}

==Structure==
A [[lantern]] hung by the entrance exterior, which had been [[item enchantment|enchanted]] decades prior to the 1480s [[DR]] by a traveling [[wizard]]. This enchantment caused it to have a perpetual glow that gradually shifted between shades of green, red, and blue. Many felt that this bore a resemblance to the [[Aurora borealis|northern lights]], iridescent ribbons of color that occasionally filled [[the North]]'s night sky, thus giving the inn its name.

==Staff==
The innkeepers of the Northern Light were sisters [[Allie Shorard|Allie]] and [[Cori Shorard]]. Allie was the younger of the two, and the joy of the Lights. Her charm was put to good use as she was the one greeting the guests and showing them to the rooms. The older sister, Cori was a stout frowning woman who was in charge of all the inn's cooking, inventory, and provisions.

The sisters' differing personalities often resulted in long arguments throughout the evenings. The arguments were almost daily, like clockwork.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the criminals of [[Ship Rethnor]] were staying at the Northern Light during their campaign to undermine trust in Speaker [[Duvessa Shane]] of [[Bryn Shander]].

Circa the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, the inn's namesake lantern was stolen, along with numerous other innocuous items in town.{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|49}}
