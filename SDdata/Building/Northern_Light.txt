The Northern Light was an inn in Caer-Konig, where travelers typically stayed in-between making a journey to Easthaven, Bryn Shander, or Kelvins Cairn.
A lantern hung by the entrance exterior, which had been enchanted decades prior to the 1480s DR by a traveling wizard. This enchantment caused it to have a perpetual glow that gradually shifted between shades of green, red, and blue. Many felt that this bore a resemblance to the northern lights, iridescent ribbons of color that occasionally filled the Norths night sky, thus giving the inn its name.
The innkeepers of the Northern Light were sisters Allie and Cori Shorard. Allie was the younger of the two, and the joy of the Lights. Her charm was put to good use as she was the one greeting the guests and showing them to the rooms. The older sister, Cori was a stout frowning woman who was in charge of all the inns cooking, inventory, and provisions.
The sisters differing personalities often resulted in long arguments throughout the evenings. The arguments were almost daily, like clockwork.
