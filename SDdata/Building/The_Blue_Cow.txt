The '''Blue Cow''' was a rowdy [[inn]] frequented by [[adventurer]]s found in the city of [[Saerloon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

==Location==
The Blue Cow was located in the northwest section of the city.

==Activities==
Famous for its chaotic brawls and bawdy tales of high adventure, the Blue Cow drew the line with [[magic]], enforcing a strict policy against casting [[spell]]s or waving [[wand]]s about. Anyone breaking these rules would have their [[magic item]]s confiscated and were charged double the normal rates during their stay.
