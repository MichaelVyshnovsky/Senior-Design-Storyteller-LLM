        "mainbody": "The Crypt of Orbakh was a large crypt of two underground levels that originally was created for Orbakh of the Tower of Bones, but became a prison for a perversive necromancer Famras and his \"child\" Beautiful Flower. The crypt was one of few undisturbed by the Cult of the Dragon until 1369 DR.\nThe Crypt of Orbakh was located in Polyandrium, a cemetery in Myth Drannor, surrounded by many other crypts and tombs. The Crypt of Orbakh was the biggest crypt and stood at the north-eastern border with the tree border and just to the east from the Crypt of Rothilion. All structures in the area were magically locked and were overlooked by the Tower of Bones.\nthumb|The location of the Crypt of Orbakh in Myth Drannors Polyandrium.\nCrypt of Orbakh was notable for its skull motifs, carved skeletons and runes. The Crypts door was a huge slab of stone, sealed with the rune of the sun that looked like a sun and corresponding word of power. The door itself was fused with the walls of the crypt by the stone shape.\nOnce inside, one could barely breathe due to no ventilation and generations of monsters living and dying in the tomb. The air was putrid reeking of filth, sweat, and gore. The creatures living inside were used to it but anyone entering from outside experienced nausea as if under the effects of the stinking cloud spell. The interior of the crypt was lit with many continual flame spells.\nThere were several pitfall spike traps created to stop grave robbers and they remain unsprung until the tomb was unsealed in 1369 DR as the inhabitants were very familiar with the traps locations. No valuables were left in any of the chambers of the crypt, apart from the burial chamber in the flooded part of the crypt, the same room the deepspawn called home. Most areas were converted into monster lairs, and drowning in centuries worth of filth.\nThe hall that hugged the northern wall had alcoved that once were occupied by skeletons serving as the crypts guardians. Past them, further north-east, laid a room that once had a black-stone throne of some purpose that at some point was shattered by falling debris.\nThe Crypt of Orbakh was constructed some time before the Weeping War and became the final resting place for one of the senior necromancers of the Tower of Bones, Orbakh. He attempted to reach lichdom but failed horribly and perished in result. His tomb was filled with undead guardians and relevant items to the necromancers occupation. Around the same time as Orbakhs body was to be interred, one of the fellow necromancers was caught performing acts too perverse even for the wizards of the Tower of Bones. Famras thrown inside the crypt and sealed in as the punishment. Unbeknownst to the necromancers, he smuggled in a young deepspawn he named Beautiful Flower. Along with the creature, Famras brought in samples of monster flesh. Eventually, the deepspawn was mature enough to reproduce the creatures out off Famras flesh samples as well as fish and cows to feed upon.\nSubsequently, most of the crypts undead guardian were replaced by bands of cloned creatures , all led by Beautiful Flower and clones of long-dead original Famras. The Crypt became a compressed ecology and existed that way until it was unsealed in 1369 DR by the group of adventures searching for the item hidden within the crypt what was to aid them in defeating dracolich Pelendralaar. Once released, the surviving creatures, along with the deepspawn poured out of the crypt, allowing the adventurers grab Orbakhs ivory scepter. When the doors were unsealed in 1369 DR, the doors cracked and shattering, effectively letting the crypt wide open.\nThe entire crypt was divided into the monsters territories. The two main chargers by the entrance were the krenshar territory, the bugbear territory stretched through the southern wall of the dungeon and ended in the flooded sub-level in the south-east, dire apes claimed the two central chambers, merrow took over the north-east of the dungeon including a flooded room of the sub-level, with Beautiful Flower and her father-son residing in the big chamber of the flooded sub-level, neighboring a merrows watery lairs chamber.\nFood was the most precious resource in the ecosystem that was the Crypt of Orbakh. Beautiful Flower created more cows than any other creatures just to keep everyone fed but even so, cannibalism was a common practice. The deepspawn was able to populate the flooded ares of the crypt with fish created out of regurgitated last meal of Famras before he was sealed in. Luckily, the fish was female and was able to change sexes, unlike all other inhabitants, and were able to freely breed. Another scarce food source was phosphorescent fungi that grew in the damp hallways.\nOriginal inhabitants of the crypt (most destroyed by the time the crypt was unsealed) were undead guardians placed there by the members of the Tower of Bones. These creatures included ghasts, ghouls, skeletons, and wights."
