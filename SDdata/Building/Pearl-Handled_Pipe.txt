The '''Pearl-Handled Pipe''' was an exquisite inn that was considered by some to be the finest establishment in all of [[Yartar]]. As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was run by [[Elladuth Myristar]], who loved buying new decorations for her ever-expanding establishment.

==Location==
It was located just west of the [[Fishyard]], Yartar's central marketplace.

==Structure==
The inn was large and spacious. It could accommodate over 600 guests in good comfort. Every time Elladuth purchased new furniture or decorations, she renovated the inn and had new rooms built.

==Interior==
Each of the inn's rooms was furnished with finely crafted chairs, desks and other pieces of furniture. Amenities were provided for every guest, among them [[quills]], [[ink]], and parchment for writing.

==Services==
Beyond the lush accommodations, the Pearl-Handled Pipe served three meals to its guests each and every day. These were nothing short of actual feasts, fit for any lord or wealthy merchant. Complementary meals for guests were made available in the common dining room; they were also served to non-guests for the price of 1 [[gp]] each.
