        "Structure": "This store consisted of only a single, sparsely furnished room. It had a small shelf and a long table for displaying potions on. Additional potions were kept within an adjacent storage room.",
        "Services": "Practical Potions carried a wide variety of potions that were all unlabeled. At one point the potions on stock at the store included ''[[elixir of life]]'', ''[[Murdock's insect ward]]'', ''[[philter of love]]'', ''[[potion of climbing]]'', ''[[potion of flying]]'', ''[[potion of fire resistance]]'', ''[[potion of gaseous form]]'', ''[[potion of healing]]'' and ''[[potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]'', ''[[potion of heroism]]'', ''[[potion of levitation]]'', ''[[potion of poison]]'', ''[[potion of rainbow hues]]'', ''[[potion of sweet water]]'', ''[[potion of ventriloquism]]'', and ''[[potion of water breathing]]''.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}\n\nThe shop would mutually check its prices against those of the neighboring [[Ollie's Discount Potions]] in order so both businesses could curtail arbitrage.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}",
        "History": "Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of thieves calling themselves the [[Hands of Mohammad]] robbed Normally Practical Potions of its entire stock and the neighboring Ollie's Discount Potions of nearly all its inventory, having been able to achieve such thoroughness against the former thanks to the [[sewers of Ravens Bluff|sewer grate]] situated behind the shop. Three days later a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Flask Circle asking about both robberies, having been tasked by the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] to track down the thieves, but [[Glathrus]] and [[Adaus]] had since fled the city and [[Ollie]] had nothing to share as he was out of the shop when the robbery went down.",
        "Inhabitants": "Normally Practical was run by a man named Glathrus and his young son Adaus."
