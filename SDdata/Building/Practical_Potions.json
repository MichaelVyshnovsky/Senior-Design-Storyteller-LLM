        "mainbody": "Practical Potions, also known as Normally Practical Potions, was a discount potions shop in the city of Ravens Bluffs Flask Circle market in the late 14 century DR.\nThis store consisted of only a single, sparsely furnished room. It had a small shelf and a long table for displaying potions on. Additional potions were kept within an adjacent storage room.\nPractical Potions carried a wide variety of potions that were all unlabeled. At one point the potions on stock at the store included elixir of life, Murdocks insect ward, philter of love, potion of climbing, potion of flying, potion of fire resistance, potion of gaseous form, potion of healing and extra-healing, potion of heroism, potion of levitation, potion of poison, potion of rainbow hues, potion of sweet water, potion of ventriloquism, and potion of water breathing.\nThe shop would mutually check its prices against those of the neighboring Ollies Discount Potions in order so both businesses could curtail arbitrage.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of thieves calling themselves the Hands of Mohammad robbed Normally Practical Potions of its entire stock and the neighboring Ollies Discount Potions of nearly all its inventory, having been able to achieve such thoroughness against the former thanks to the sewer grate situated behind the shop. Three days later a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle asking about both robberies, having been tasked by the City Watch to track down the thieves, but Glathrus and Adaus had since fled the city and Ollie had nothing to share as he was out of the shop when the robbery went down.\nNormally Practical was run by a man named Glathrus and his young son Adaus."
