The '''Dwarfstone''', also known as '''Durn's Finger''' in some ballads, was a [[standing stone]] in [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|24}}

==Description==
It stood alone at the southern end of the vale, leaning at a peculiar angle over the rubble wall of a local farm. It was described as like a stern, pointing finger.

==Significance==
To most travelers, it simply marked the southern limit of the village of Maskyr's Eye. However, the villagers themselves thought it to be sacred to the [[dwarves]] of the Vast, and would not dare disturb it, nor even venture near it. As to what the dwarves knew of it, none had said anything about it, at least within the memory of [[human]]s by the late 1350s [[DR]].
