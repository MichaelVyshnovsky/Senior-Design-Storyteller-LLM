        "mainbody": "he Phandalin Miners Exchange was a trading post and guildhall in Phandalin that purchased materials from local miners.\nThe exchange was located to the southwest of Phandalin, and directly east of a trail used by the local miners.\nA lot of the villagers spent their time here, particularly those that had spent most of the working day around the countryside.\nThe company would purchase quantities of ore and gems from the miners of Phandalin. Each piece was carefully measured and weighed, and then its price was determined.\nIt further functioned as a records office, which registered claims to specific parts of the land, such as valleys, streams, and excavations.\nIn 1491 DR, the business was headed by Halia Thornton, a Zhentarim agent. Although the local brigands, known as the Redbrands, hassled almost all the businesses in Phandalin, they did not even attempt to ruin trade for the Phandalin Miners Exchange.\nThe Miners Exchange suffered from financial difficulties throughout the early 1490s DR because the flow of resources from the mines was irregular. It would sometimes go for months with no revenue.\nAs of 1496 DR, the business had been taken over by Sharna Quirstiron, a member of a splinter faction of the Zhentarim, who had killed Halia in order to replace her."
