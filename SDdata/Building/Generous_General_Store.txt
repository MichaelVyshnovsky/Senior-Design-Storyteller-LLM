'''Generous General Store''' was a store of [[Skull Crag]] in the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
The shop traded in a vide variety of mostly mundane goods. Most of of it of little interest to the adventuring folk, apart from such necessities as [[cloak]]s, [[belt]]s, [[boots]], [[robe]]s, and [[mirror]]s.

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, the Generous General Store was the only general store in Skull Crag, and was popular among the travelers of the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. Ironically enough, Generous General Store was quite overpriced during that period of time.
