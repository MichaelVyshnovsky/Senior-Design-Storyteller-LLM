Fallen Stars Fish was a fresh fish shop located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The shop was located in the southwest section of Waterdeeps North Ward on the south side of Suldown Street. 
All of the fish sold here came from the Sea of Fallen Stars. Many customers were willing to pay the high prices for cleaned and gutted fish here because it was rumored that the owner used magic to ensure they were only several hours old after being caught and delivered.
Gatos Firlack owned Fallen Stars Fish.
