        "mainbody": "'''Castle Never''', also known as the '''Keep of Lord Never''', was the stronghold and home of the rulers of [[Neverwinter]] prior to the destruction of the city in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Castle Never was located in the western quadrant of the city inside of a sharp southward bend of the [[Neverwinter River]] just before it emptied into the [[Bay of Mists|harbor]].\n\nBefore the [[Neverwinter Nights|Luskan invasion]], Castle Never was considered to be part of the [[City Core (Neverwinter)|City Core]],<ref name=NVN1> and after the war it was known as part of the [[Blacklake District]].<ref name=NVN/> During the rebuilding efforts of the late years of the 15{{th}} century DR, the Castle was considered part of the [[Protector's Enclave]].",
        "Structure": "[[File:Sailing to Neverwinter.png|thumb|300px|''Castle Never rises above the city as seen from the [[Sea of Swords]].'']]The tall, gleaming towers of Castle Never were the first thing that visitors arriving by sea saw of Neverwinter. It was a stone building\n\nThe Castle was heavily damaged by the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the [[Ruining]]. Half of its towers crumbled, the western wall collapsed, and the courtyards were littered with toppled statues and chunks of fallen stone. Being built on an strong foundation, however, the rest of the castle was left mostly intact. however it would be cleared and largely rebuilt over the following years.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atrium": "During the height of the Alagondar family's rule, the castle boasted an open-air garden and aviary. It contained a lovely collection of flowers and other plants, as well as beautiful birds in ornate cages. Following the Ruining, the plants and birds alike were left to rot, and the atrium came to be overtaken by aggressive [[myconid]]s that spawned from the spores of something in the plant collection. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, they had managed to completely seal the once open roof, leaving the garden dark and trapping the smell of rot and the blooms of [[fungus]] inside.",
            "Great Hall": "The castle's Great Hall was where the throne of the city's ruler was located.<ref name=NVN/> It was appointed in marble with a red carpet, and it contained ancient magical defenses that raised the alarm and sealed the gate if the castle came under attack.<ref name=NVN/>",
            "Hall of Mirrors": "This long corridor with a massive window on one end was adorned with full-length mirrors, and was used by the royal family to practice posture and appearance. However, this proved to be one of the most horrific places in the castle when Mount Hotenow erupted: first the mirrors shattered, slashing all occupants to pieces, just before searing volcanic gasses blasted through the window and incinerated the bodies. The spiritual wound this left on the victims caused the ash and glass in the room to animate and slowly reenact the event whenever a living being entered the room. During this time, it came to also be known as the '''Hall of Ashen Mirrors'''.",
            "The Vault": "The treasures of Castle Never and its occupants were stored in a secure vault known to be one of the most tightly secured locations on the [[Sword Coast]]. Portcullises on the windows and an alarm that quickly mobilized the guards were meant to ensure that no thief who got near the vault would escape. As of the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the door to the vault itself was protected by ''[[Mordenkainen's arcane seal]]''.",
            "Neverneath": "Also known as the \"Endless Maze\", Neverneath was the catacombs of Castle Never, containing a fortified dungeon"
        },
        "Activities": "Prior to the Ruining, the castle was the seat of the lord of Neverwinter. It was where rulers like [[Nasher Alagondar]] received visitors in the 14{{th}} century DR.<ref name=NVN1 /> By the very late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Dagult Neverember]] had sufficiently restored the castle to once again hold court there.",
        "History": {
            "Destruction": "[[File:Castle never ruins 4e.jpg|thumb|''Castle Never in ruins as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.'']]Castle Never was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, with much of the structure collapsing or burning. All members of the Alagondar family were believed to have died during in the cataclysm, alongside almost anyone else who was inside the castle at the time. The [[ghost]]s of these many dead souls dwelt within the castle from then on, and although these spirits were not always hostile to intruders, they reacted violently to any perceived thief or pretender to the throne. and then to the [[Hall of Justice]] with the arrival of Dagult Neverember in the {{YearlinkName|1469}}.\n\nIn the absence of any human inhabitants, Castle Never was home to only ghosts until territorial myconids evolved from fungal spores in the and [[ettercap]]s from the dungeons moved up to claim the ruins, led by a self-described \"prophet\" called [[Ryxfith]]. Then, [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and her [[undead]] [[Thay]]an forces arrived, driving the ettercaps into the upper floors and remaining towers. In the meantime, Valindra began using the depths of the Neverneath as a lair for her [[dracolich]], [[Azharzel]], starting in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.\n\nFinally, that same year, [[adventurer]]s in service to Neverwinter launched a raid on Castle Never intending to oust Valindra once and for all. They successfully fought their way through her undead forces and a [[giant spider]] pet, defeated the beholder Talgath, and slew the dracolich Azharzel. This broke Valindra's hold on the castle, but it still remained a haunted and undead-infested ruin.&mdash;efforts to begin clearing the castle began, but were immediately stymied by [[demon]]s and the apparent appearance of [[Orcus]] within its depths, along with a reanimated Talgath and an [[illithilich]] known as [[Cthylarr]].",
            "Restoration": "By the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, despite Castle Never still being a dangerous ruin, Lord Protector Dagult Neverember had publicly announced plans to restore it in hopes of bringing prosperity to Neverwinter,\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1496}},{{AI-time}} rebuilding efforts were still ongoing, and the restoration of Castle Never had become Neverember's highest priority. By that year, an area beneath the castle had been made into a prison&mdash;called \"the holes\" by locals&mdash;where those sentenced to death by Neverember were imprisoned. This included [[Oppal DeScart]], a [[doppelganger]] working for [[Acquisitions Incorporated]], who was wrongfully arrested when an [[orc]] she was impersonating was witnessed committing a murder.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves Sofina, Forge, and Kira.jpg|thumb|300px|''From left: Sofina, Forge, and Kira in an audience chamber.'']]Following the apparent completion of repairs in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Castle Never was known as a secure and impregnable fortress. It also became home to the newly ascended Lord of Neverwinter, [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], along with his foster daughter [[Kira Darvis|Kira]] and his advisor [[Sofina]].",
            "Heist": "During his reign, Forge Fitzwilliam reintroduced the deadly [[High Sun Games]], and proposed to use Castle Never's secure vaults to house the enormous amounts of wealth brought into town by rich individuals to gamble on the Games, including [[Porb Piiradost]] from [[Waterdeep]] and [[Din Caldwell]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. However, the Castle's defenses were relatively easily evaded by Forge's former allies, the thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and their ally [[Doric]]. First, the [[druid]] Doric used her ''[[wild shape]]'' ability to scout the Castle&mdash;infiltrating it as a [[fly (insect)|fly]] before escaping as a [[rat]] and [[eagle]]&mdash;and subsequently the thieves mounted a heist by distracting the exterior guards with an [[illusion]], battling the interior guards by luring them into the armory, and disabling the vault's ''arcane seal of Mordenkainen'' with the ''[[helm of disjunction]]''. However, this led them to discover that Forge had plotted all along to simply steal the accumulated wealth in the vault, and had already transferred it to a secret dock beneath the [[Neverwinter arena]] to be secreted out of the city by [[ship]]. The intruders were ultimately captured by Sofina with the use of the spell ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', and sentenced to fight in the High Sun Games."

        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that some survivors of the destruction of Neverwinter had hid the treasures of the Alagondar family in secret rooms and vaults that were magically protected and would only open to a true heir of the Alagondar bloodline. although this item was subsequently obtained and concealed by Dagult Neverember in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "Prior to Castle Never's destruction, notable inhabitants included:\n* [[Halueth Never]], the elven warrior credited with founding the original keep.<ref name=NVN />\n* [[Nasher Alagondar]], the Lord (and later King) of Neverwinter in the latter half of the 14{{th}} century DR.\n\nFollowing its destruction, notable inhabitants included:\n* [[Ryxfith]], leader of the ettercaps in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Talgath]] the Watcher, a beholder who attempted to claim the ruin in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n\nFollowing its restoration, notable inhabitants included:\n* [[Dagult Neverember]], the Lord Protector of Neverwinter.\n* [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], a conman, thief, and the usurper of Neverember's position in the late 1490s DR.\n* [[Kira Darvis]], the foster daughter of Forge Fitzwilliam who had her own room in the Castle.\n* [[Sofina]], a [[Red Wizard]] and agent of [[Szass Tam]] who aided Forge in securing lordship over Neverwinter for her own aims."
