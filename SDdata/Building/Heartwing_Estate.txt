'''Heartwing Estate''' was an estate and [[pegasus]] farm on the east bank  of the [[Winding Water]] in the [[Western Heartlands]], near [[Boareskyr Bridge]].

==Location==
The estate was located upstreamA map supplement for ''[[Serpent Kingdoms]]'' places Heartwing Estate south of Boareskyr Bridge, far from the Winding Water. This is assumed to be an error.

==Structure==
Heartwing was considered a small estate.

==Services==
The [[wizard]] [[Aluena Halacanter]] raised pegasi on the estate; these could be purchased for 5,000 [[gp]] per steed. Potential customers were vetted through a series of ([[magic]]ally assisted) examinations and interviews to ensure they would make capable owners. The sales contract included a clause stating that if a pegasus was maltreated and returned to Heartwing, no refund would be given.

==History==
The first generation of pegasi raised on the estate was spawned from a clutch of eggs Aluena rescued from the nearby [[Serpent Hills]], where pegasus nests were often raided by reptilian predators.

==Inhabitants==
