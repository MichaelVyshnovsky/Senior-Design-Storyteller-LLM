Heartwing Estate was an estate and pegasus farm on the east bank  of the Winding Water in the Western Heartlands, near Boareskyr Bridge.
The estate was located upstreamA map supplement for Serpent Kingdoms places Heartwing Estate south of Boareskyr Bridge, far from the Winding Water. This is assumed to be an error.
Heartwing was considered a small estate.
The wizard Aluena Halacanter raised pegasi on the estate these could be purchased for 5,000 gp per steed. Potential customers were vetted through a series of (magically assisted) examinations and interviews to ensure they would make capable owners. The sales contract included a clause stating that if a pegasus was maltreated and returned to Heartwing, no refund would be given.
The first generation of pegasi raised on the estate was spawned from a clutch of eggs Aluena rescued from the nearby Serpent Hills, where pegasus nests were often raided by reptilian predators.
