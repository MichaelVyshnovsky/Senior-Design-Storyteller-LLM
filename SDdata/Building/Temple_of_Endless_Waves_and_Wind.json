        "Rumors & Legends": "The presence of the zaratan in the Sea of Fallen Stars was something of a mystery considering the creatures were native to distant [[Zakhara]]. However, one tale from the [[Time of Troubles]] told of a small army of [[reef giant]]s that left Zakhara with a large turtle strapped to their backs."
