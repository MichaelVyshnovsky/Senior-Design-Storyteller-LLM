The Festhall of Eternal Delight was the center of Sharess worship in Faer√ªn.
The temple was located along the waterfront in Calimport.
The Festhall of Eternal Delight was an extravagant complex consisting of dark marble columns, tall spires, pristine gardens, and priceless crystalline statues. The baths within the temple were famous for their rejuvenating effects. The many flowers decorating the complex provided aphrodisiac and calming effects for patrons.
A previous temple to Sharess existed on the same location but was destroyed by the Night Parade.
The temple was guarded by a variety of creatures including giants, ogres, a faerie dragon, an air-breathing sirine, and others.
