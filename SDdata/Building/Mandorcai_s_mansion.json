        "mainbody": "'''Mandorcai's mansion''' was a mysterious manor-house located in the [[Bloomridge]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]]. While it was believed to have been built by its namesake lord, the [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] [[Mandorcai]], its origin was much more [[fiend]]ish in nature.",
        "Description": "From all outward appearances, the mansion seemed, as it were, an ordinary, albeit dusty and abandoned, manor house.\n\nDescriptions of the interior from those who had spent a significant length of time inside spoke of rooms soaked in blood and spatially-morphic environments.",
        "History": "Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the mansion first appeared in Baldur's Gate, literally overnight. It appeared in an empty lot of land, fully furnished, complete with its own house staff and lord of the manor, Mandorcai. In fact, it had been gifted to the [[mage]] as part of his agreement with his [[devil]]ish benefactors.\n\nJust as Mandorcai quickly became the talk of the town, he retreated from public life and only corresponded with others by paper invitation. Requests went out that others come visit him within the mansion. While these invitations were a mystery to the Baldurian citizens, they were in fact part of an agreement Mandorcai had with the [[chain devil]]s, [[Kyrix]], and [[Valisog]]. He would bring them blood sacrifices in return for the manor and [[arcane]] knowledge he had received.\n\nThe recipients of the notes who followed the instructions were never seen again, sacrificed to the devils. After a few such incidents, a contingent of [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers raided the home. Only two of them survived, and they found no sign of the wizard, his staff, or the \"guests\". \n\nFollowing the investigation, the [[Council of Four]] had the mansion boarded up and ensured that their subordinates ignored the house. The infernal invitations continued to appear for a number of years and, in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a number of cult members managed to break into the hellish mansion."
