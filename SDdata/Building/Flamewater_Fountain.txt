The Flamewater Fountain was a popular landmark fountain in Athkatlas Gem District.
The Flamewater Fountain stood in the chaotic and resplendent westerly part of the Gem District, to the northwest of Jalasra Fourwyndss manse in the 14 century DR and to the north of the Shadowgates House.
By the late 14 century DR, the Flamewater Fountain had become a beloved meeting place of the Athkatlas wealthy inhabitants. The plaza surrounding the fountain was often swarmed by perfume peddlers and makeup "touchover lasses."
