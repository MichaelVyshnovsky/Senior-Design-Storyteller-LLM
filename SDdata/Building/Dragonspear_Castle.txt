Dragonspear Castle was a dwarven fortress built upon the High Moor during the 13 century DR. It had a long and storied history within Western Heartlands. It served as home to monstrous humanoids, became the battleground for two wars between Faer√ªnians and devils from the Nine Hells, and was even the stronghold for an angelic Shining Lady and her crusade
Dragonspear Castle was built across three low hills on the southwestern edge of the High Moor, east of Trollbark Forest and just north of where the Coast Way joined the Trade Way.
Extensive tunnels were dug under the keep, connecting with the subterranean Nepenthe River, the abandoned city of Kanaglym, and the greater depths of the Underdark. This underground waterway continued northwest to a small cave located within the Misty Forest.
The caves and tunnels beneath the castle housed colonies of giant, incandescent fungi,
The castle was infamous for the inter-planar portal located in the dungeon beneath its keep. This portal linked the castle to Avernus, the first level of the Nine Hells, allowing passageway for baatezu and other devils into Toril.

The outermost walls of the keep held the Great Gate and nine grand towers encircled the castles outer ward. They stood 30 feet (9.1 meters) above the hill on which they were built, and built 10 feet (3 meters) underground. Four large turrets, 40 feet (12.2 meters) in height, were positioned at the easternmost and middle points of the hexagonal figure. The two barbican turrets, of similar height but smaller width, sat at the two western points flanking the inner gate.
Inside the courtyard at the front of the main keep was the Hold of Battle Lions, a ruined shrine dedicated to Tempus. It was destroyed once and rebuilt after the end of the Second Dragonspear War. Although the building itself was destroyed, its altar held a holy relic that allowed the castles portal-sealing wards to be replenished. Also outside the keep were several large iron cages that dated back to the First Dragonspear War. Since the hobgoblin occupation at that time, the cages have been used by the soldiers of the Shining Crusade, and the group of vampires that laired in the castle over a century later.
Perhaps the most notable feature of the castles keep was the skeleton of a colossal red dragon that draped over battered rooftop. The structure itself was in great disrepair, with glaring holes and cracked stones.
The ceiling of the keep was 30 feet (9.1 meters) above its stone tiled floor, at the highest point of its vaulted ceiling. 
Standing in the keeps anteroom were four marble statues depicting human champions wielding swords and shields inlaid with the images of dragons. 
The walls of the main hall were adorned with several tapestries, decorative shields, and six gargoyles. Its floor comprised stone tiles that were laid in a diagonal orientation.
The northern wing served as the castles original barracks. Despite its disrepair it offered decent shelter, and was even used as a makeshift boarding house for Coalition forces decades after its original occupants.
While it was later destroyed, the southern wing once served as the castles library and held a private study.

In the , the aasimar known as the Shining Lady gathered an army of zealous warriors and mercenaries, calling it the Shining Crusade. They occupied Dragonspear Castle and led a campaign against the Bhaalspawn that saved Baldurs Gate from the machinations of Sarevok. Once again the armies of Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep came together, and along with the armed forces of Daggerford, formed a Coalition that fought against the crusade at the siege of Bridgefort and again at the castle itself.
Following the battle at Dragonspear, the portal to Avernus was briefly opened by an imp masqueraded as the human cleric Hephernaan. No fiendish forces escaped from the Nine Hells however, due to the efforts of the Bhaalspawn hero Abdel Adrian and his fellow adventurers.
Some time before the , the castle came under control of undead horrors that were led by the entity known as Born.The 4e Campaign Guide omits all mention of fiends it maintains that the shrine of Tempus was overwhelmed by undead arising from the Nepenthe River, despite Volos Guide specifically saying (a) it was a temple and (b) it was destroyed by baatezu.
Later, around the , the rakshasa Nadir convinced the Szarlnaxi vampires to open the weakened seal that shut away the portal beneath Dragonspear, so that they could free the soul of their former leader, Voltan Szarlnaxi. In truth, Nadir sought revenge on his arch-nemesis, the paladin of Lathander Sir Isteval. The portal to Avernus was briefly opened once again, but closed in short order thanks to the efforts of Sir Isteval and the adventurers that accompanied him.
The first 100 years or so of the castles history was chronicled in the book, A Historical Treatise of Dragonspear Castle.
