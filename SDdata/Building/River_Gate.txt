The Rivers Gate was one of three entry points into the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The River Gate provided access to the city from the south near the shore of the Delimbiyr River. The gate was located at the junction of the Hill Road and Wall Street.
The River Gate was usually closed at night, especially during the flood season.
The gate was only accessible after crossing a moat and bridge. The road leading through the gate passed beneath a single guard tower.
