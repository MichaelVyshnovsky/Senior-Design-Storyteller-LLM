The Gate of Elephants was found in the city of Muluk in the Free Cities of Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Gate of Elephants was located on the southern wall of the city. It opened to a garden right before the Royal Lagoon within Muluk and led to the docks.
A pair of elephants were carved into the framework of the gate, giving the portal its name.
A garrison of 200 soldiers was stationed at the Gate of Elephants, making the gate a fortress as much as it was an entryway into Muluk.
