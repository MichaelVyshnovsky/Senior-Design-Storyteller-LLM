        "mainbody": "The '''Silken Rack '''was a bathhouse and massage parlor situated in the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]].",
        "Description": "It was a prestigious leisure establishment that ignorant folk would mistake for a fine clothing emporium. It had rooms that could be rented, offering bathing pools and others where massages took place. Many considered it to be one of the finest leisure spots in Menzoberranzan, with members of the noble houses of the city labeling it as a \"palace of delight.\"",
        "Activities": "The establishment operated as a spa and a massage parlor, offering baths, massages with [[spice]]d [[oil]]s and probably other bodily pleasures. Some of the masseurs were seen to be [[human]] [[slave]]s that were reputed to be very skilled and attractive, but [[deaf]]-mute and lacking their tongues. The slaves would display their characteristic meekness and lack of eye contact, although that would not hinder their ability to perform skilfully. Clients would usually roam the areas of the building naked.\n\nThe place was also used as a meeting point for business, since rooms could be rented and offered some shelter from prying eyes.",
        "Customers": "The clientele mostly comprised drow [[elves]], both male and female. Drow from noble houses regarded the Silken Rack as a pleasurable and high-end establishment worthy of praise.\n\n[[Waerva Baenre]] was a regular customer, greatly enjoying the massages. She also used it to meet with [[Umrae]] in order to conspire and elevate her position in [[House Baenre]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}."
