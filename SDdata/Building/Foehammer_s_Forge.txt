'''Foehammer's Forge''' was a renowned smithy found in the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. Its proprietor was the [[dwarf]] master smith [[Ghelryn Foehammer|Ghelryn "Goldhand" Foehammer]].

==Activities==
Ghelryn produced a large quantity and variety of metalwork items that were sold in shops found all over [[the North]] and along the [[Sword Coast]]. The quality of his metal and his craftsmanship was above average, and his prices cheaper. In particular, his [[eyebolt]]s, [[latch]]es, [[nail]]s, and [[pin]]s were crucial to the success of [[Wainwright's Wagons]] and other [[wagon]] repairmen in town.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Location==
The forge was located in the north end of town, on the west side of the [[Long Road]] and across the way from [[Uldinath's Arms]]. Foehammer's and Uldinath's enjoyed a long-standing but amiable rivalry.

==History==
Foehammer's Forge was well-established in Triboar by the mid-1360s DR.

By the late 1480s DR, Ghelryn was growing too old for day-to-day work and had begun looking for an apprentice, but could not find any who met his standards.

When Ghelryn fashioned fine suits of ceremonial armor for King [[Morinn]] and Queen [[Tithmel]] of [[Citadel Felbarr]], they awarded him an honorary title as Royal Armorer. This strengthened the already strong reputation of Foehammer's Forge.
