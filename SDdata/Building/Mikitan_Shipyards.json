        "mainbody": "The Mikitan Shipyards was a large compound found in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe shipyards were located in southern Daggerford near the River Gate along the Hill Road and Wall Street.\nThe Mikitan Shipyards was a large workshop that had enough space to build large vessels. This gave it a notable advantage over their main competitor, the adjacent but smaller Dekoran Boatwright."
