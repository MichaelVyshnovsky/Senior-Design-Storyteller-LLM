        "mainbody": "The '''Lyceum of the Black Lord''' was a temple of [[Bane]] found in the city of [[Phlan]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|14}} For a time it was a place of great importance, as the worship of Bane was the prevalent faith among Phlan's citizens.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|18}}",
        "Location": "The temple was located in [[Phlan/Nobles' Quarter|Nobles' Quarter]] of Phlan's [[Phlan/Old City|Old City]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|53}}",
        "Structure": "The lyceum was a specimen of exquisite architecture, featuring fitted stone walls ascending up to a domed ceiling.\n\nBeneath the temple was a secret prison used by Phlan's [[Knights of the Black Fist]] soldiers to illegally interrogate and even kill those they took prisoner. These dungeons were accessible by underground tunnels that linked to caves along the shore of the [[River Stojanow]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|27}}",
        "Interior": "The interior of temple walls were covered with a coat of smooth white plaster.",
        "Services": "In what was seen as a profound heresy by the greater [[church of Bane]], the priests of the Lyceum of the Black Lord maintained that Bane's existence was wholly annihilated by the god [[Torm]] during the [[Avatar Crisis]]. They believed the being that emerged in the Realms a few years later was in fact [[Iyachtu Xvim]] who had claimed his divine father's name and likeness in order to achieve greater power.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|80}}\n\nThe priests of the temple differed from other Banite clergy in another significant manner; they close to maintained reasonable ideological beliefs, focusing on the tenets of restraint and deference to the city's powers.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}}",
        "History": "At some point prior to the 14{{th}} century DR, the temple was once dedicated to the god of suffering [[Ilmater]].\n\nSome time after the [[Dragon Run]] that devastated Phlan in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, the temple was taken over the [[half-orc]] Banite cleric called [[Mace (half-orc)|Mace]]. Mace's orc minions ran amok throughout the surrounding affluent neighborhood of the city.\n\nAn adventuring party delved into the depths of the ruined temple in [[Old Phlan]] to search for old [[Ilmatari]] [[relic]]s, at the behest of the [[gnome]] [[cleric]] [[Dirtan]]. It was unknown if they were ultimately successful in their endeavor.\n\nThe temple remained in ruin as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, but eventually grew to become the most distinguished place of worship in the city.\n\nSome time after the {{yearlinkName|1480}}, the temple fell to ruin once again and no worshipers of Bane or any other deity practiced their faith within.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|18}} After the [[green dragon]] [[Vorgansharax]] claimed Phlan as his own and his [[Tears of Virulence]] followers overrun the city streets, the Lyceum of the Black Lord became the site of a battle between them and the allied forces that remained loyal to Phlan over all others.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|47}}"
