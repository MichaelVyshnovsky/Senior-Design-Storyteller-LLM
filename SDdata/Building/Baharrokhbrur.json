        "mainbody": "aharrokhbrur was the name of the opulent mansion (known locally as a klathlaaedin) belonging to the prominent Khaundrove family located in Kh么ltar, south Faer没n circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nBaharrokhbrur was one of two klathlaaedin that occupied the angle of land where the North Way intersected Hael Way at Farrgaunlar (the southern gate through the walls of Kh么ltar, the Iron City. Baharrokhbrur was the easterly estate that fronted the North Way, being the southernmost building on the west side of that street. The westerly estate that fronted Hael Way was called Anthormbrur and was owned by a rival family, the Horthanders.\nThis mansion was a connected compound of buildings. There were three square towers topped with open-air belfries that formed one side of the triangular-shaped court. These were connected to the main tower, a huge elliptical structure, by a bridge that made a prime observation platform for viewing the courtyard below. Suspended between these towers was a musical sculpture a sloping cascade of hundreds of small bells that chimed when touched by the wind. The back wall of the court, connected to the main tower like the root of a tree, were the stables, the servants quarters, and the guest houses.\nThe architectural and artistic elements of this klathlaaedin were more subdued or restrained than most trophy-mansions in Kh么ltar. Instead, the ostentatious aspect was in the building materials. It was constructed from very expensive stone imported from the northeastern reaches of the Deep Realm and then covered with a facade of even more expensive cream-colored stone. The cost of this estate was easily more than twelve times the cost of a typical greatfist (large tower) elsewhere in the Iron City.\n* Ansgul Khaundrove"
