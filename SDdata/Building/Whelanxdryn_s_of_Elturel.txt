Whelanxdryns of Elturel was a large and wide-reaching scabbard-making business in Elturel during the 15 century DR.
Whelanxdryns produced leather scabbards for export across much of Faer√ªn. It had its own tannery for preparing the hides it used, and a metalworking workshop that produced the various small metal fittings that reinforced and strengthened the scabbards. The business used an ever-changing supply of cheap metal and hides from passing traders, rather than a permanent supplier. It was linked by a merchants map to the Arthane Armory in Waterdeep, which bought the scabbards for newly made longswords and other weapons.
