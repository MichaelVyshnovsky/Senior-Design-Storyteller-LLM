In truth, while the items on display were indeed magical, they were only copies of the true artifacts, which were stored deep in the vaults beneath the temple. The magics on the display items were tracking enchantments. Anyone who tried stealing an artifact could thus be easily found and summarily beheaded.<ref name=Calimport-pp56-57 />\n\nThe entrance to the secret vault was hidden underneath the main altar on the first floor. The altar could be moved, providing access to a long series of winding stairs.<ref name=Calimport-pp56-57 />\n\nThird floor housed the [[Deneir]]rath who served at the temple.<ref name=Calimport-pp56-57 />"
