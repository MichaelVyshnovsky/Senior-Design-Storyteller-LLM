        "mainbody": "esters Clubhouse was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Jesters Guild.\nJesters Clubhouse was located at the corner of Pressbow Lane and Shrimp Alley, in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis guildhall stood only a single story tall.\nIn 1357 DR, the group that would later be known as the Jesters Guild robbed the corpse of a jester from the past century, Myyrth, from the Anteos family crypt in the City of the Dead and brought it to the clubhouse as part of a plot planted in their minds by the Musicians Guild. A plot that their then-guildmaster Bazzle referred to as the greatest \"practical joke\" the city had ever seen.\nOn that same night the jesters went on to confront and knock out the heroes of Sel√ªnes Smile in the City of the Dead, as they had been looking into their graverobbing on behalf of the ghost of Myyrth. They then brought the unconscious adventurers back to the Jesters Clubhouse.\nIn front of the adventurers, the jesters relayed their plans before proceeding to cast a combination of spells on Myyrths corpse, One of the jesters then remarked that they probably should have conducted their plan outside of the building, before Myyrths skeleton walked off and started wreaking havoc in the city."
