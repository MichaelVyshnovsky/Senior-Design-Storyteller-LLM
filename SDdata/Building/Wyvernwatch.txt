'''The Wyvernwatch''' inn was a walled-off, multi-structure establishment located in the city of [[Myth Drannor]], that operated during the city's glory days leading up to the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Wyvernwatch was the favored establishment among many travelers coming to the city, particularly for its convenient accommodations.

==Location==
The  was located just south of Sixstar, on the [[Stroll of Minstrels]] in the ward of [[Myth Drannor/Kerradunath|Kerradunath]].

==Structure==
Set within its own outer walls that separated the grounds from the surrounding city, the Wyvernwatch comprised three different buildings, set around a central courtyard.

The main inn was three stories tall, the topmost of which housed offices and the owner's personal residence. Another two-story structure, and its underground level, held a separate taproom and adjoining brewery. The third and smallest of Wyvernwatch's buildings housed its stables.
