The Wyvernwatch inn was a walled-off, multi-structure establishment located in the city of Myth Drannor, that operated during the citys glory days leading up to the 8 century DR.
Wyvernwatch was the favored establishment among many travelers coming to the city, particularly for its convenient accommodations.
The  was located just south of Sixstar, on the Stroll of Minstrels in the ward of Kerradunath.
Set within its own outer walls that separated the grounds from the surrounding city, the Wyvernwatch comprised three different buildings, set around a central courtyard.
The main inn was three stories tall, the topmost of which housed offices and the owners personal residence. Another two-story structure, and its underground level, held a separate taproom and adjoining brewery. The third and smallest of Wyvernwatchs buildings housed its stables.
