        "Interior": "The model map was still intact as of the the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, and offered the only evidence that the city of Skelem had once had a wall and had been twice as large as was apparent from the surviving ruins.\n\nUpon entering the building, a ''[[magic mouth]]'' would appear on the opposite wall and ask the visitor three history questions:\n* \"Who stole [[Mystra]]â€™s power in order to become a [[deity]]?\" (correct answer: \"[[Karsus]]\")\n* \"What is the name of the [[Creator race|progenitors]] of the [[serpent races]]?\" (correct answer: \"The [[sarrukh]]\")\n* \"What two empires rose six hundred years before the [[fall of Netheril]]?\" (correct answer: \"[[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]]\")\n\nIf the visitor correctly answered at least two of these questions, an [[illusory]] pillar would appear on the model map to mark the location of the [[Kossuth's House]] where the ''[[Elemental Scourge]]'' was hidden. Answering two or more questions incorrectly caused the pillar to appear in an incorrect location in the northeastern corner of the city.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[fire giant]]s [[Soluf]] and [[Gharod]] sent an excavation team to Skelem to search for the ''Elemental Scourge''. This group was led by a team of [[yuan-ti abomination]]s who discovered the Map House. They thus began digging in the wrong place."
