        "mainbody": "'''Efusio's Cafe''' was an open-air eatery in [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] ''circa'' the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Efusio's Cafe stood in the center of a plaza in one of the richer parts of Arrabar. Cobblestone lanes converged on the cafe's plaza.",
        "Interior": "Efusio's had a huge open patio at the cafe's front filled with small tables. The tables stretched from inside the patio and spilled onto the plaza providing customers with gathering spots.",
        "Services": "Among products offered by Efusio's were expensive imported treats such as [[Tethyrian]] [[tea]], strong [[Tashalar]]an [[kaeth]], rich [[ale]]s such as [[Mulhorandi dark]], and a vide wariety of ''[[balaumo]]'' and [[pipeweed]]. Some of the more notable fruit-infused tobacco blends included [[cherry]], [[apricot]], [[apple]], [[peach]], and [[grapewood]].",
        "History": "On [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, [[Grozier Talricci]], the head of noble [[House Talricci]], visited the cafe as he mentally communicated via magics with his cabal composed of representatives of other noble houses of Arrabar. [[Vambran Matrell]] was the topic of discussion as he witnessed and began investigating deaths of [[Hoytir]] and [[Jithelle Skolotti]], servants of [[House Pharaboldi]]. The commoners were killed at the behest of Grozier Talricci and his sneak coin cabal. During his visit, Grozier was served by a plump young servant girl with beautiful deep black eyes that attracted the nobleman's admiration."
