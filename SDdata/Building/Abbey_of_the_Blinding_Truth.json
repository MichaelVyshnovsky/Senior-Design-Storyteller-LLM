        "mainbody": "The '''Abbey of the Blinding Truth''' was a temple devoted to the Maimed God [[Tyr]], located in [[Westgate]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was constructed in the [[King's March]], sometime around the year [[1372 DR]] to oppose the [[Night Masks]] criminal organization that ran rampant throughout the city.",
        "Activities": "The militant High Lord Abbot [[Grigor Khazaar]] led the [[cleric]]s, [[monk]]s, and [[paladin]]s of Tyr in an active campaign against the Night Masks and their leadership. In the year after the abbey's founding, they regularly clashed with the criminal guild and greatly weakened their operations.\n\nCouncilor [[Seirkas Undo]] was seen attending services within the chapel of the Tyr's abbey."
