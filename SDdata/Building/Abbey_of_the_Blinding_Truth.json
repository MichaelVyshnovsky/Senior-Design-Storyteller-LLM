It was constructed in the Kings March, sometime around the year 1372 DR to oppose the Night Masks criminal organization that ran rampant throughout the city.\nThe militant High Lord Abbot Grigor Khazaar led the clerics, monks, and paladins of Tyr in an active campaign against the Night Masks and their leadership. In the year after the abbeys founding, they regularly clashed with the criminal guild and greatly weakened their operations.\nCouncilor Seirkas Undo was seen attending services within the chapel of the Tyrs abbey."
