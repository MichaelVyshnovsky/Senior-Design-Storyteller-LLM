'''Minauthkeep''' was a ruined elven stronghold in [[Cormanthor]] and the base of operations for the [[drow]] of [[House Jaelre]].

==Geography==
Minauthkeep was located in the forest of Cormanthor. From a ''[[portal]]'' in Cormanthor leading to the [[Labyrinth]], it was five days west to a small river, and from there, a day's journey south to Minauthkeep.

==Structure==
Minauthkeep's ruined structures and crumbling foundations were covered in green vines and included a collapsed [[iron]] gate. They were made to look abandoned despite being occupied.

The Minauthkeep castle had a secret chamber behind a bronze mask of [[Vhaeraun]].

==History==
Minauthkeep was settled by House Jaelre between [[1322 DR]] and [[1372 DR]] after their exodus from the [[Underdark]]. They desired to take over the ruined [[Elven Court]] and use its [[mythal]]s to ward off enemies.
