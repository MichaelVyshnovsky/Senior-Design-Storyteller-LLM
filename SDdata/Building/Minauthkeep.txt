Minauthkeep was a ruined elven stronghold in Cormanthor and the base of operations for the drow of House Jaelre.
Minauthkeep was located in the forest of Cormanthor. From a portal in Cormanthor leading to the Labyrinth, it was five days west to a small river, and from there, a days journey south to Minauthkeep.
Minauthkeeps ruined structures and crumbling foundations were covered in green vines and included a collapsed iron gate. They were made to look abandoned despite being occupied.
The Minauthkeep castle had a secret chamber behind a bronze mask of Vhaeraun.
Minauthkeep was settled by House Jaelre between 1322 DR and 1372 DR after their exodus from the Underdark. They desired to take over the ruined Elven Court and use its mythals to ward off enemies.
