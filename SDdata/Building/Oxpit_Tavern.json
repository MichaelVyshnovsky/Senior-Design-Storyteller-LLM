After the taverns owner Chroomeg requested the City Watch investigate the issue, at which they failed miserably, he hired on some mercenaries to act as tavern guards. The vandals were actually a number of giant badgers dug up through the taverns cellar, under the influence of a cultist of the Black Earth. The druid of the Emerald Enclave Seranolla became trapped in the cellar investigating the matter, but was rescued by a band of adventurers.\nBranislav Semyon was a regular patron of the Oxpit tavern and used it as a meeting place for his assassination contracts."
