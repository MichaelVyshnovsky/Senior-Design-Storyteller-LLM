        "mainbody": "he Chamber of Law and Civility was the legislative house used by the Senate of the city-state of Innarlith.\nIt was located in the wealthier second quarter of Innarlith, very close to the Palace of Many Spires.\nA huge amphitheater inside the building was used as the legislative chamber for the senate. The focal point of the amphitheater was the Ransars throne that stood on a four-tiered dais. The throne itself was carved from a single slab of redwood from the High Forest. The room consisted of soaring flying buttresses that held up a domed ceiling that was  above the floor. The interior was painted in Sembian frescoes that showed scenes of commerce and civil discourse, in a way that resembled a temple to Waukeen, although it was more lavish. A gallery overlooked this chamber where spectators could watch the proceedings of the chamber.\nThe chairs of the senators were each unique and very ornate, because each senator purchased his or her own chair and they competed among themselves to show who had the most luxurious and ornate seat.\nThe Senate of Innarlith held deliberations in this chamber. The public was almost never allowed entry, except for one day of the year on Midsummer when a ceremony for new members of the senate took place.\nThere were several hearing rooms apart from the main chamber that were used by senate committees. The largest of these rooms was in the east wing and it had large windows of blue cobalt glass. \nOn Highharvestide, 1365 DR, Senator Salatis overthrew Ransar Osorkon in a coup. During the coup, the chamber was empty, but the Red Wizard Marek Rym√ºt, who was secretly behind the coup, entered the chamber and sat on Salatiss chair. Osorkon, who had a collection of crystal balls that he used to spy on the people of Innarlith, could see him there and Marek was aware he was being watched through the crystal ball. Osorkon thought he saw Marek make eye contact with him from where he was sitting on Salatiss chair through the crystal ball and Marek smiled. Shortly thereafter, Salatiss assassins entered Osorkons office and killed him.\nOn Uktar 3, 1366 DR, a hearing took place in the east wing about Ivar Devorasts management of a canal project that was supposed to connect the Lake of Steam to the Nagaflow. The result of the hearing was Devorasts dismissal from his post and the installation of Willem Korvan as the new head of the project.\nOn Kythorn 10, 1374 DR, Ransar Pristoleph went to address a meeting of senators in the chamber in order to ostensibly offer his resignation and turn over power in the city to Senator Meykhati following a civil war fought between the Ransar and a faction of senators. However, during Pristolephs address of the chamber, he accused the senators of being the puppets of Thay and then used his control over fire to cause the lights in the chamber to burn those who were present. He had arranged for wemic mercenaries to surround the building and assist with his own escape. \nOn Eleasis 8, 1374 DR, Pristolephs forces ambushed and captured the remnant of the leadership of the senate faction that were fighting against him outside the building."
