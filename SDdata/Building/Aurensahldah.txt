Aurensahldah was a temple in Calimport dedicated to the worship of the goddesses Lliira and Waukeen.The temples entry in Calimport starts by stating it is dedicated to Lliira and Chauntea. However, the rest of the profile speaks only of Lliira and Waukeen.
Aurensahldah was located in Noal Drudach, part of the Evyrtaan Sabban of Faiths Ward, in Calimport.
Aurensahldah was separated into two buildings, the older main building being four stories tall and the more recent addition being three stories tall. Stamped into a wall above the entrance to the main building was a brightly polished gold coin,  in diameter, emblazoned with the symbol of Waukeen.
The main building of the temple was constructed around the 10 century DR.Calimport does not give a specific date for the temples construction beyond it being "more than 300 years old."
Some time after 1365 DR, when a prophet of the goddess Lliira went to every temple of Waukeen and announced that she would be acting as regent for Waukeens portfolio until the goddess returned, the temples head priest decided to construct an adjoining smaller temple building dedicated to the Joybringers worship.
The temple was run by the reserved Pasha Uarel yn Petal el Waukeen and his hedonistic son Rahim yn Uarel el Lliira.
