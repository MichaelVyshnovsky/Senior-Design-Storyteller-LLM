Inside, the Glitter Gala was a collection of displays, showcases, and chests, with its walls decorated with paintings. The area behind the counter hid a cellar hatch.

==Services==
The Glitter Gala sold non-[[enchanted]] jewelry and gemstones imported from [[Amn]], [[Cormyr]], and even such faraway places as [[Damara]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], the shop was run by Mme Omotola. One of the individuals who sought employment at the time was [[Ellswin Glimrock]], an artisan refugee from the city of [[Elturel]]. Ellswin wrote to Omotola, praising her glittering shop and offered her services as a resident jeweler.

The same year, The Glitter Gala was contracted to craft Lady [[Firelia Jannath]]'s wedding [[ring]]s for the ceremony that took place at the [[High Hall]].

During the 1492 DR, one of Madame Omotola's Glitter Gala business partners or investors was Lord [[Enver Gortash]], secretly one of the leaders of the dreaded [[Cult of the Absolute]]. Omotola's business also supplied other fanciful shops with gemstones, such as [[Figaro Pennygood]]'s [[Facemaker's Boutique]].
