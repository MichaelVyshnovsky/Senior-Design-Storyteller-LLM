The Glitter Gala sold non-enchanted jewelry and gemstones imported from Amn, Cormyr, and even such faraway places as Damara.
In the , during the Absolute crisis, the shop was run by Mme Omotola. One of the individuals who sought employment at the time was Ellswin Glimrock, an artisan refugee from the city of Elturel. Ellswin wrote to Omotola, praising her glittering shop and offered her services as a resident jeweler.
The same year, The Glitter Gala was contracted to craft Lady Firelia Jannaths wedding rings for the ceremony that took place at the High Hall.
During the 1492 DR, one of Madame Omotolas Glitter Gala business partners or investors was Lord Enver Gortash, secretly one of the leaders of the dreaded Cult of the Absolute. Omotolas business also supplied other fanciful shops with gemstones, such as Figaro Pennygoods Facemakers Boutique.
