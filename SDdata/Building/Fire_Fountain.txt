The Fire Fountain was a fountain of flame at the center of the city of Myth Nantar, in Ser√¥s.
The mythal of the city allowed for surface-only effects, such as the fountains ability to shoot flames, which would otherwise have been impossible underwater. The fountain also warmed the water inside the city.
