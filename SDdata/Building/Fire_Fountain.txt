The '''Fire Fountain''' was a fountain of flame at the center of the city of [[Myth Nantar]], in [[Serôs]].

The [[mythal]] of the city allowed for surface-only effects, such as the fountain's ability to shoot flames, which would otherwise have been impossible underwater. The fountain also warmed the water inside the city.
