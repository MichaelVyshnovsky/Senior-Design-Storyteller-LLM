The '''Golden Bowl of the Goddess''' was a temple dedicated to [[Chauntea]] and located at the highest point of the city of [[Iriaebor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. It was dwarfed only by the taller spires of the [[High Tower of Iriaebor]].

==Structure==
The ''Golden Bowl'' was a big temple, being home to more than forty [[priest]]s.

The uppermost floor of the temple was unroofed, and magically heated. Plants and flowers cultivated there would bloom even in the middle of winter, and were distributed to the townspeople to lift their spirit.

==Services==
The priests of the temple spent most of their days outside the temple, helping the faithful with their agricultural duties.
