        "mainbody": "The Royal Flagon was a fairly unremarkable, though well-patroned, tavern located in Tegals Mark, Tasseldale, during the midâ€“14 century DR. Despite, or perhaps because of, its less-than-memorable features it was a great place for sell-swords to find work and travelers to hear news and gossip.\nThe Flagon had low-priced ale served in giant tankards, which, along with its convenient location, helped add to its popularity among the folk of Tasseldale. They had a policy of \"no music, no fighting\"."
