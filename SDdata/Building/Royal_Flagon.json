        "mainbody": "The '''Royal Flagon''' was a fairly unremarkable, though well-patroned, tavern located in [[Tegal's Mark]], [[Tasseldale]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Despite, or perhaps because of, its less-than-memorable features it was a great place for sell-swords to find work and travelers to hear news and gossip.",
        "Services": "The Flagon had low-priced ale served in giant tankards, which, along with its convenient location, helped add to its popularity among the folk of Tasseldale. They had a policy of \"no music, no fighting\"."
