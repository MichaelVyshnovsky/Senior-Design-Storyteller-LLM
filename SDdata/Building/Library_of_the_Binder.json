        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, an order of [[Banite]] [[crusader]]s known as the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]] conquered and occupied the neighboring city-state of [[Mintar]]. Many Oghmanytes fled from Mintar in its fall, escaping to the Library of the Binder in Saelmur. There they donated to the temple's library whatever [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s of faith, knowledge, or music that they had managed to carry with them.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}} the Library of the Binder's clergy were frequently pressuring their [[priest|high priest]], [[Presman Taliemin]], to rally aid to the Oghmanytes who were operating a resistance movement in Mintar against the Knights of the Black Gauntlet."
