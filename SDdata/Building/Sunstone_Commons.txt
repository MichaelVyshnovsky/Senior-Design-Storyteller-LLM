Sunstone Commons was a star-shaped open area in the city of Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet.
It was used as a common meeting place, an area for delivering speeches or crying news, and a day and night market, particularly for trading in wine and food, with elven merchants trading for temporary stalls.
A large statue of Corellon Larethian was located at the center of the plaza. At night, the area was lit by large sunstones.
