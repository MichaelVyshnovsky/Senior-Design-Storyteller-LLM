The '''Oakenhall''', or simply the '''House of Silvanus''' to the outsiders, was the most prominent temple dedicated to [[Silvanus]], the Oak Father, in the [[Vilhon Reach]] and located on the isle of [[Ilighôn]].

{{quote|''The druids who'd built the House of Silvanus had constructed it from the natural materials at hand. They took advantage of the shapes of trees and enhanced the rocky shelves that provided some respite from the elements. During part of the day, light filtered into the inner courtyards, then was shaded as the sun tracked across the sky. At night, guests in the House of Silvanus could gaze upon the stars.''|[[Shinthala Deepcrest]]}}

==Location==
A holy site for the worshipers of the Forest Father was located on the plateau atop the [[Elder Spires]] at the heart of Ilighôn. It could be reached by the long winding stone-stepped [[Hierophant trail]], a walkway that led to the temple from the small city of [[Sapra]].

==Structure==
The Oakenhall was an open structure of [[granite]] and [[wood]], surrounded by cold mountain river waters that formed beautiful waterfalls and covered the House of Silvanus with mist. These waters cascaded down the Elder Spires, forming the [[Calling River]], [[Elder River]], and [[Springbrook]]. Older druids and pilgrims could be found praying along the banks of the Oakenhall.

==Activities==
The druidic conclave was an important part of the [[Emerald Enclave]]. Any individual who wished to join the organization had to eventually make a pilgrimage to the Oakenhall to complete the initiation ceremony. The House of Silvanus was the only place on Toril where questioning and disagreements among the members of the Emerald Enclave were allowed to be aired. Outside of the temple, Emerald Enclave was to stand in a single united front at all times.

==Defenses==
The Oakenhall's stone steps were defended by one of [[Eldath]]'s [[water elemental]]s. Whatever magics guided the elemental, it was unheard of for the creature to attack innocent travelers unprovoked.

==History==
The Oakenhall was established by the followers of Silvanus during a ceremony in [[Midsummer Night]] in the {{YearlinkName|374}}. The House of Silvanus initially was a small [[druid]]ic conclave for those who mastered ''[[shapechange|shapechanging]]'' and was able to reach the island in a shape of a [[bird]]. Thr temple's construction was finished just a few years later.

In the {{YearlinkName|717}}, druids of the Oakenhall officially joined the Emerald Enclave.
