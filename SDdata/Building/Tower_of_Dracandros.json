        "mainbody": "The '''Tower of Dracandros''' was a tower located close to the [[village]] of [[Hap]] in [[Battledale]]. It was the home of [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]], [[Dracandros|Dracandros of the Crimson]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Tower of Dracandros was the latest keep built on the top of [[Haptooth Hill]], a remnant of an ancient [[:Category:Volcanoes|volcano]]. The hill helped the tower dominate the area and first of all the village of Hap. It was surrounded by a forest that was dense with [[oak]], [[beech]], and [[maple]] trees",
        "Structure": "The ground level of the Tower of Dracandros had a courtyard, a meeting hall, a festhall, and a kitchen. The meeting hall had an entrance to the [[Dungeon|caverns]] of Haptooth Hill, which led into the [[Underdark]] through a system of tunnels. \n\nThe floor above had a hall of triumphs, that is, a museum chronicling every noteworthy act Dracandros had engaged in. Trophies, mounted creatures, plaques, ribbons, and various certificates of recognition adorned the hall. The level also contained a meeting room with a huge portrait of the Thayan [[wizard]].\n\nThe third level was used as a laboratory and a storage room for everything the wizard needed for his experiments.\n\nDracandros's bedroom and treasury were located on the fourth level of the tower. The treasury once had a ''[[manual of golems]]''.\n\nThe flat roof of the tower used to be a place where the [[dragon]] minions gathered.",
        "History": "In the middle of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]],{{PoR-FRC-time}} the tower was built and became the residence of a Red Wizard of Thay, Dracandros of the Crimson, an ally of a [[dracolich]] named [[Crimdrac]]. Dracandros ruled the nearby village of Hap through the dracolich and his [[dragon]]s, as well as with the help of the wizard's [[efreeti]] and [[drow]] minions.\n\nBy [[1371 DR]], the tower was shattered, reduced to debris and decay, and surrounded by scattered dragon bones. The evil beings once residing in the tower were said to have finally been, slain leaving the tower empty. Nevertheless, the villagers of Hap avoided the hill and the tower. The most desperate [[adventurer]]s visited the tower in pursuit of the ''[[Crown of Dracandros]]'', but not all left the Wizard's Tower alive, being killed by its protective magic. The rest were content with collecting the dragon bones, which were in a great demand among alchemists and [[Sembia|Sembians]] who wished to claim to be dragon-slaying heroes.",
