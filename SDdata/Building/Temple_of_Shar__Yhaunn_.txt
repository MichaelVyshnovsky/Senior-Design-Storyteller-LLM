The temple of Shar of Yhaunn in Sembia was a hidden underground cell presided over by the priest Bolan until its discovery and destruction in 1373 DR.
The temple was located inside a maze of centuries-old abandoned mining tunnels carved into the southern cliffs surrounding Yhaunn. It consisted of dark, confusing tunnels and chambers that connected with numerous hidden access points in the city, allowing the faithful to enter and leave unnoticed.
Under Bolans guidance, the congregation of just under thirty faithful rarely if ever took part in kidnapping, murder, and other obvious crimes. Instead of ritually murdering an innocent, Bolan would produce an illusion instead. This ensured that the city authorities and even the Selûnite temple of Moonshadow Hall was unaware of their presence.
During the initiation ritual, new converts were made to drink a substance called the Elixir of the Void. It was a poison that would kill the victim if they did not complete the ritual and have the poison cleansed by divine blessing.
Bolan used the Selûnite priestess Velsinore as a source of information in Moonshadow Hall, allowing him to keep track of their  activities.
During special events, the congregation were fond of dancing wildly and hitting large metal rings to produce a deafening clamor of discordant music.
In Kythorn of the , the shade priestess Variance Amatick arrived from Thultanthar and took control of the cult. She used the cults resources to execute a plan to steal The Leaves of One Night from Fourstaves House, the secure home of the wizard Strasus Thingoleir.
Throughout Eleasis, Variance manipulated Strasuss feckless son Keph into joining the cult of Shar and falling under her influence. In addition to using Keph to steal The Leaves, she used her congregation as a distraction by having them openly attack Moonshadow Hall. Despite the best efforts of Feena Archwood, she successfully acquired The Leaves and escaped to Thultanthar.
In the course of her victory, the temple was discovered, Bolan was killed, and the entire cell captured. The surviving members were then given the chance to repudiate Shar and seek the mercy of Selûne, or be tried for their crimes by the city.
