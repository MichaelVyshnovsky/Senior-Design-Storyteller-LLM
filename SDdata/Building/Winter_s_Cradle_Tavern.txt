The Winters Cradle Tavern was a tavern in Easthaven within the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale.
Located in the northeastern part of Easthaven, the wooden building looked ramshackle on the outside. In front of it was a sign that bore the name of the tavern alongside an image of a key.
The tavern was a comfortable place with a fireplace burning to keep the cold northern chill from the bones of any adventurer.
The tavern was owned by Grisella who sold Winter Wine, meads, frost giant yellow snow melts, Grisellas Dale ale, Luskan stout, Cormyrian brandy, and knee cracker cider. The tavern was often patronized by the dwarf Hildeth Highhammer and the soldier Hrothgar.
In Mirtul, 1281 DR, the cellar of the Winters Cradle had an infestation of beetles.
