        "mainbody": "'''Misker's Warehouse''' was a warehouse in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The warehouse was a two-story building in fair condition with an unremarkable exterior. It was the smallest and least imposing of [[Misker]]'s three warehouses.",
        "Description": "The warehouse housed Misker's most precious goods, including stolen [[gold]] coins, [[gem]]s, jewelry, art objects, and, on occasion, captive individuals.",
        "Interior": "The first floor appeared entirely empty, save for a stairway leading to the upper level, but it concealed a complex, lethal [[trap]]. This trap employed a sophisticated mechanism of weights, counterweights, ropes, pulleys, and dangerously sharp implements. Those unaware of its existence were likely to suffer severe, and potentially fatal, injuries upon entering.\n\nThe second floor contained Misker's treasures, secured within locked and heavily trapped [[iron]] strongboxes. To further protect these valuables, Misker sometimes employed a [[basilisk]] or hired a [[medusa]] as a guardian. As a result, he was known to sell realistic stone \"statues\" to collectorsâ€”figures resembling fighters frozen in mid-action, which may indeed be unfortunate trespassers who met their end by those guarding Misker's contraband."
