        "mainbody": "Miskers Warehouse was a warehouse in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nThe warehouse was a two-story building in fair condition with an unremarkable exterior. It was the smallest and least imposing of Miskers three warehouses.\nThe warehouse housed Miskers most precious goods, including stolen gold coins, gems, jewelry, art objects, and, on occasion, captive individuals.\nThe first floor appeared entirely empty, save for a stairway leading to the upper level, but it concealed a complex, lethal trap. This trap employed a sophisticated mechanism of weights, counterweights, ropes, pulleys, and dangerously sharp implements. Those unaware of its existence were likely to suffer severe, and potentially fatal, injuries upon entering.\nThe second floor contained Miskers treasures, secured within locked and heavily trapped iron strongboxes. To further protect these valuables, Misker sometimes employed a basilisk or hired a medusa as a guardian. As a result, he was known to sell realistic stone \"statues\" to collectorsâ€”figures resembling fighters frozen in mid-action, which may indeed be unfortunate trespassers who met their end by those guarding Miskers contraband."
