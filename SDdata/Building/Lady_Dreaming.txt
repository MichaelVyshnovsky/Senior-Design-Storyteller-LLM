The '''Lady Dreaming''' was one of the colossal [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] located in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] on the far northern slope of [[Mount Waterdeep]].

==History==
During the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the walking statue appeared and rampaged through the city. When the statues were stopped, she fell onto her side, where she still lay by [[1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Description==
It resembled a noble woman asleep in a garden. She bore the appearance of a female [[elf]] and, while active, her clothing and hair appeared to move naturally.
