The Lady Dreaming was one of the colossal Walking Statues of Waterdeep located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep on the far northern slope of Mount Waterdeep.
During the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the walking statue appeared and rampaged through the city. When the statues were stopped, she fell onto her side, where she still lay by 1492 DR.
It resembled a noble woman asleep in a garden. She bore the appearance of a female elf and, while active, her clothing and hair appeared to move naturally.
