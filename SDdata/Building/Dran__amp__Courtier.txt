The '''Dran & Courtier''' was an inn in [[Red Larch]]. A favorite of locals and travelers, the inn also secretly served as testing ground for new recruits of the adventuring company [[Acquisitions Incorporated]].

|Stop by the Dran & Courtier if you're ever in Red Larch. In late summer, preferably. Come hungry.

==Interior==
The inn had a reputation for being a quiet place with eerie magical properties.

==Services==
In addition to its services as inn and restaurant, the Dran & Courtier also worked as a testing and evaluation facility for new members of Acquisitions Incorporated. Members who passed through the front door holding an [[acorn]] dipped in [[gold]] were transported to the [[Test Market]], a version of the inn that existed in [[extradimensional space]] and could be shaped to accommodate different testing situations.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1496}},{{AI-time}} the Dran & Courtier was commandeered by the adventuring company known as [[the Six]] and turned into the central site of a ritual aimed at using a fragment of the ''[[Orrery of the Wanderer]]'' to open a portal to the [[Far Realm]]. As the ritual progressed, the entire city of Red Larch suffered initial warping effects caused by the opening portal.

==Inhabitants==
The inn was owned and operated by [[Prophetess Dran]] and her wife [[Audra Courtier]].
