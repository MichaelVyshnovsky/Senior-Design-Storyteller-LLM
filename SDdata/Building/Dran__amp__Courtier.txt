The Dran & Courtier was an inn in Red Larch. A favorite of locals and travelers, the inn also secretly served as testing ground for new recruits of the adventuring company Acquisitions Incorporated.
The inn had a reputation for being a quiet place with eerie magical properties.
In addition to its services as inn and restaurant, the Dran & Courtier also worked as a testing and evaluation facility for new members of Acquisitions Incorporated. Members who passed through the front door holding an acorn dipped in gold were transported to the Test Market, a version of the inn that existed in extradimensional space and could be shaped to accommodate different testing situations.
In the , the Dran & Courtier was commandeered by the adventuring company known as the Six and turned into the central site of a ritual aimed at using a fragment of the Orrery of the Wanderer to open a portal to the Far Realm. As the ritual progressed, the entire city of Red Larch suffered initial warping effects caused by the opening portal.
The inn was owned and operated by Prophetess Dran and her wife Audra Courtier.
