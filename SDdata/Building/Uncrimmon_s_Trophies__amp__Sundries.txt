'''Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries''' was a [[Mosstonian]] store that bought and sold curious of interest, usually catering to adventurers, alchemists, [[wizard]]s, and traveling [[cleric]]s.

==Location==
Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries was located at the western wall of Mosstone, beyond a sharp-turned offshoot of the [[Carldeir Lane]]. The store's unusual-looking tall oval door was painted in a color of dark dried blood that glowed in unsettling green radiance after dark. A small sign outside was the only indication that Uncrimmon's, in fact, was a store.

==Interior==
Uncrimmon's usually had very few customers inside the store. The store's walls were covered in countless open drawers and shelves that often reminded visitors of open coffins. The shelves had arrangements of large bottles and slopping drawers held [[human]] [[skeletons]]. 

==Services==
Said human bones, as well as anything inside the [[bottle]]s and [[jar]]s, was available for purchase. Uncrimmon's catered to a very specific clientele who was interesting in dealing in body parts of exotic creatures, pickled, dried, and fresh, that ranged from whole [[bat]]s to [[mind flayer]] face tentacles.

Apart from macabre supplies, the store carried ''[[sleeping potion]]s'', a wide variety of [[poison]]s and venoms, ''[[antidote]]s'', rare living [[spider]]s, tiny [[mimic]]s, [[tarrasque]] teeth, [[sahuagin]] scales, and many other supplies.

==Inhabitants==
[[Ardreth Ulnshoor]] was the storekeep in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Ardreth was considered creepy by locals who thought him to be able to read minds and be an illithid in disguise. In reality, he was a [[doppelganger]], the fact that was confirmed by local [[Harper]]s. Ardreth's true nature was a secret to most, and rumors of him being a mind flayer kept most untrustworthy elements out of the store.

Ardreth Ulnshoor did not tolerate customers stealing or attempting to swindle him. Occasionally, he had to use his ''[[medallion of ESP]]'' and shapeshifting abilities to deal with ne'er-do-well and cheats. Apart from that, he liked to get to know his clients with a bit of psionic probing.

Apart from the storekeep himself, the store was guarded by two floating armored torsos, [[helmed horror]]s, that floated above the entrance and followed shoppers inside with their [[sword]]s drawn. The horrors were able to generate magic spells with their sinister glowing eyes, and other parts of the store were enchanted to hurl and deflect powerful magics.

The last "resident" of the store was a floating human eye and a floating human hand that assisted Ardreth Ulnshoor running the store. These magical floating body parts, in reality, were instruments through which the store's true owner, [[Uncrimmon]], operated. Uncrimmon was a powerful wizardly [[beholder]] who laired somewhere in the forests outside of Mosstone. Through the eye, the powerful aberration was able to see, hear, and talk, and through the hand, Uncrimmon was able to cast spells, hold and carry kings, and even clumsily wield smaller weapons, like a [[dagger]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Local tales of Mosstone often spoke of the skeletons that were purely displayed in Uncrimmon's Trophies & Sundries. Locals wintered and gossiped about them actually being animated [[undead]] guardians of the store. However, that was likely nothing but tall tales.
