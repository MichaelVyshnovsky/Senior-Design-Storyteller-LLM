        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Shar''' in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]] was a place of worship dedicated to [[Shar]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the [[Temple of Umberlee (Bezantur)|Temple of Umberlee]] to the south, the [[Temple of Auril (Bezantur)|Temple of Auril]] to the east, and the [[Temple of Helm (Bezantur)|Temple of Helm]] to the north.",
        "Structure": "The temple was a long building with an amphitheater at its southern end. It was built of dark-colored stone.",
        "Activities": "Evil rites and dark magic rituals were performed in the amphitheater.\n\nServices at the temple were popular among the citizens of Bezantur. They were conducted by [[priest]]esses in black hooded [[robe]]s, and were often attended by [[Red Wizards]] and even evil [[cleric]]s of other [[deities]].\n\nThe temple also served as a base from which to launch attacks on followers of Shar's hated rival, [[Sel√ªne]], and to coordinate the [[Church of Shar|Sharran church]]'s meddling in affairs far beyond the City of a Thousand Temples.",
        "History": "The Thayan Church of Shar was considered subordinate to the Thayan [[Church of Myrkul]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] prior to the [[Time of Troubles]]. As a consequence, the Sharran high priestess of the time reported to the high priest of [[Myrkul]]. Additionally, most shrines to Shar were located within temples to Myrkul, with the temple in Bezantur being one of only three that were dedicated only to Shar (the other two being located in [[Eltabbar]] and [[Pyarados]], with one other semi-independent shrine located in [[Surthay]]). Following the Time of Troubles, the Temple of Shar in Bezantur aligned itself first with [[Cyric]] and then increasingly with [[Iyachtu Xvim]].\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, worship of Shar was popular in Bezantur and throughout Thay."
