Elhazirs Exotica was a popular but expensive gift shop found in Arabel, Cormyr in the mid- to late 14 century DR, which sold rare and unusual gifts and treasures.
The shop was located in the center of the city, across the street from Phaeshas boarding house and Vondors Shoes and Boots.
Elhazirs Exotica was filled with elegant display cases, rich carpet, and a professional staff.
This gift shop had a well-earned reputation for providing rare and wondrous items such as wyvernskull bathtubs, dragonscale shields, and many more curiosities. Many of these rare treasures were purchased directly from adventurers and sold to rich Sembian clientele.
It was known to a select few that Elhazir also sold enchanted daggers and authentic dragon eggs, though these were not on display in the shop and were stored in a locked room. The mage enchanted the daggers himself, usually granting them powers such as feather falling, light, or faerie fire.
All of the sales staff of the shop were the daughters of Elhazir. Some of the daughters were talented mages, allowing them to easily spot potential thieves. One of the daughters even had use of the time stop spell for use in dire situations.
