The Mighty Manticore Tavern was a tavern located in the heart of the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
The tavern was located at the busy crossroads of Selduth Street and the Street of Silver.
Imzeel Coopercan, a half-dwarf, was the proprietor of the Mighty Manticore. One of the barmaids under his employ was a female human named Ginalee. Imzeel sought all the knowledge he could obtain from overhearing the patrons to his establishment.
The taverns name came from the stuffed and mounted lions head located over the bar that was imaginatively referred to as a manticore. However, most patrons referred to the head as the Mangy Manticore.
This tavern was known for its thick and flavorful stew, sharp cheese, fresh black bread, and hearty ale.
The Manticore catered to merchants and politicians, thanks to its location in the heart of the Castle Ward as well as its advantageous backdoor into the Jesters Court where more private business could be conducted.
In the days leading up to the Midsummer Faire in 1364 DR, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun secret met with the Masked Minstrel at this tavern. However, his disguise was accidentally revealed by fellow wizards of the Waterdeep.
