The '''Mighty Manticore Tavern''' was a [[tavern]] located in the heart of the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
The tavern was located at the busy crossroads of [[Selduth Street]] and the [[Street of Silver]].

==Staff==
[[Imzeel Coopercan]], a [[half-dwarf]], was the proprietor of the Mighty Manticore. One of the barmaids under his employ was a female human named [[Ginalee]]. Imzeel sought all the knowledge he could obtain from overhearing the patrons to his establishment.

==Atmosphere==
The tavern's name came from the stuffed and mounted [[lion]]'s head located over the bar that was imaginatively referred to as a [[manticore]]. However, most patrons referred to the head as the Mangy Manticore.

==Provender==
This tavern was known for its thick and flavorful stew, sharp [[cheese]], fresh black bread, and hearty [[ale]].

==Patronage==
The Manticore catered to merchants and politicians, thanks to its location in the heart of the Castle Ward as well as its advantageous backdoor into the [[Jester's Court]] where more private business could be conducted.

==History==
In the days leading up to the [[Midsummer]] Faire in [[1364 DR]], [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] secret met with the [[Masked Minstrel]] at this tavern. However, his disguise was accidentally revealed by fellow wizards of the Waterdeep.
