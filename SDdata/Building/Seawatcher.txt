Seawatcher was the name given to a lighthouse located on the Sword Coast of western Faer√ªn.
It was located on a rocky outcropping along the stretch of the coast south of the library-fortress of Candlekeep, west of High Hedge and the Coast Way.
Just north of the lighthouse was a small cove that housed treasure of the infamous pirate Black Alaric.
The stone lighthouse stood tall above a pair of adjacent buildings, all of which were encircled by a tall stone wall.
In the , a young boy was playing in the buildings around the lighthouse when a pack of worgs forced him to seek shelter within. While he was trapped his mother Ardrouine hurriedly sought out help from passers-by.
The sirine matriarch Sil and two of her companions dwelled on the stretch of the coast surrounding the lighthouse.
