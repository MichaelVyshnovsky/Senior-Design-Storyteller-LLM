'''Battlehall''' was a shrine devoted to [[Tempus]], the god of war, located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Location==
The shrine was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] in the section of the city located on the south bank of the [[River Tesh]]. Battlehall sat upon [[Zhent Avenue]] near the center of the Foreign Quarter.

==Description==
The building resembled a small fortress. Spears were wedged onto the uppermost battlements, each sporting a [[humanoid]] invader's head upoint the point.

==Activities==
Given his worshipers enjoyment of battle, many of Tempus' followers within Zhentil Keep were members of the [[Zhentilar]] and made their way to Battlehall. These were usually lower ranking soldiers since the Zhentilar rarely promoted Tempus' faithful given their lust for battle and sometimes wreckless behavior purely for the thrill of combat.

==Inhabitants==
Following the majority of Zhentil Keep's destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Battlehall's high priest, or Battlemaster, was [[Bladreth Crackbone]]. Bladreth was assisted by eight other [[priest]]s.
