Merivold Pony Park was a small pony ranch found in the town of Triboar. It was run by two sisters, Janna and Leera Merivold.
It was located on the east side of town, just north of the Evermoor Way.
The Pony Park comprised a small and charming cottage, a small paddock enclosed within a picket fence, and a vivid barn adorned with a weather vane wrought into the shape of a pony.
The Merivold sisters bred, reared and trained ponies that were then sold as steeds for halflings.
