        "mainbody": "The Lonesome Tankard inn was considered among the finest of its kind in Eveningstar. Visitors were likely to meet Dunman Kiriag, the friendly innkeeper who ran this historic, famous and often overcrowded inn in the 14 century DR.\nThe inn was located in the northeast section of Eveningstar.\nThis two-story structure included a covered front porch, common rooms, and luxury rooms.\nThe Tankard offered lodgings, drink, and a wide selection of dishes to its guests. Foods on offer included braised beef stew, cornmeal porridge, crispy bacon, ghallanda rations, grilled turkey leg, leek and potato soup, pea soup, poached sunfish, roast boar shank, smoke-cured ham, brown bread and the drinks menu consisted of bubbling brown froth, grape juice, broccoli juice, Dirty Kobold, energy tonic, ghallanda distillate, dwarvish sparkling apple cider, Stormreach lemonade, and milk.\nDarwell Kiriag was the owner of the Lonesome Tankard in the 15 century DR. During that time, a group of adventurers from another world set out to explore the infamous Haunted Halls with some possible help from a Harper agent Olarra Idlewist, who posed as the inns patron, and a Amaunatoran spirit binder Melinde Agister."
