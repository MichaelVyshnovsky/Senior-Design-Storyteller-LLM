        "mainbody": "The '''Museum of Heavy Magic''' was unique magical museum that used [[heavy magic]]-based [[illusion|illusory]] \"spell art\" exhibits, found in [[Eileanar]] until its destruction in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Incarnum}}",
        "Location": "The Museum was located on the southern edge of the city, near to the [[Netheril Mint]].",
        "Services": "The Museum was three stories tall and contained 52 huge, spacious rooms filled with illusion-imbued heavy magic that depicted various scenes from [[Netheril]]s history. On entering a room filled with heavy magic, the visitor felt a brief period of nausea before all of their senses were taken over by powerful hallucinations and phantasms. Scenes on display included [[Ioulaum]]'s creation of the first ''[[mythallar]]'', the raising of [[Xinlenal]], and the \"[[Orc]] Attack Exhibit\" that infrequently caused heart attacks. Despite the perfect realism, sensory immersion, and interactive nature of the exhibits, the guests were completely safe and couldn't actually be physically harmed.\n\nAs the gallery exhibits was created by [[Karsus]] himself, many events had slight deviations from the historical accounts held by sages. Despite his peculiarities, Karsus did somehow control himself and managed to resist the urge to insert himself into every historical event.",
        "History": "The museum's heavy magic had an unintended side-effect on its visitors that only became apparent generations later. Repeat visitors absorbed a certain amount of the heavy magic, and this was passed on to their descendants in the form of a beneficial magical mutation that bestowed the innate [[incarnum]] magic used by [[meldshaper]]s such as [[totemist]]s, [[soulborn]], and [[Incarnate (practitioner)|incarnate]]s. At the same time, the museum's mutative effects were also responsible for creating many of the separate magical folk that became the [[karsite]]s.\n\nAs the gallery was visited by many people from High and Low Netheril, the meldshaper trait was widely spread throughout the successors to Netheril, particularly the inhabitants of [[Anauria]], [[Hlondeth]], and [[Asram]]. The curious birthright could also be commonly found among the [[Tunlar]] of [[Tun]], the [[Marsh Drover]]s of the [[Farsea Marshes]], the nomads of [[the Ride]], and the [[Shadovar]] of [[Thultanthar]]. To a lesser extent it also manifested in the [[Illuskan]] descendants of Netheril, the [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]]s of [[Halruaa]] and [[Nimbral]], and even the lesser-known city of [[Philock]] that was later absorbed by the [[drow]] of [[Sshamath]], leading to some [[half-drow]] developing meldshaper abilities. As a result of the Netherese diaspora that spread to [[Cormyr]] and the [[Moonsea]], the magical mutations from the Museum of Heavy Magic were most widespread across the [[Eastern Heartlands]] and [[north Faer√ªn]], particularly among the northern [[Chondathan]]s and [[Vaasan]]s."
