        "mainbody": "The Museum of Heavy Magic was unique magical museum that used heavy magic-based illusory \"spell art\" exhibits, found in Eileanar until its destruction in .\nThe Museum was located on the southern edge of the city, near to the Netheril Mint.\nThe Museum was three stories tall and contained 52 huge, spacious rooms filled with illusion-imbued heavy magic that depicted various scenes from Netherils history. On entering a room filled with heavy magic, the visitor felt a brief period of nausea before all of their senses were taken over by powerful hallucinations and phantasms. Scenes on display included Ioulaums creation of the first mythallar, the raising of Xinlenal, and the \"Orc Attack Exhibit\" that infrequently caused heart attacks. Despite the perfect realism, sensory immersion, and interactive nature of the exhibits, the guests were completely safe and couldnt actually be physically harmed.\nAs the gallery exhibits was created by Karsus himself, many events had slight deviations from the historical accounts held by sages. Despite his peculiarities, Karsus did somehow control himself and managed to resist the urge to insert himself into every historical event.\nThe museums heavy magic had an unintended side-effect on its visitors that only became apparent generations later. Repeat visitors absorbed a certain amount of the heavy magic, and this was passed on to their descendants in the form of a beneficial magical mutation that bestowed the innate incarnum magic used by meldshapers such as totemists, soulborn, and incarnates. At the same time, the museums mutative effects were also responsible for creating many of the separate magical folk that became the karsites.\nAs the gallery was visited by many people from High and Low Netheril, the meldshaper trait was widely spread throughout the successors to Netheril, particularly the inhabitants of Anauria, Hlondeth, and Asram. The curious birthright could also be commonly found among the Tunlar of Tun, the Marsh Drovers of the Farsea Marshes, the nomads of the Ride, and the Shadovar of Thultanthar. To a lesser extent it also manifested in the Illuskan descendants of Netheril, the Halruaans of Halruaa and Nimbral, and even the lesser-known city of Philock that was later absorbed by the drow of Sshamath, leading to some half-drow developing meldshaper abilities. As a result of the Netherese diaspora that spread to Cormyr and the Moonsea, the magical mutations from the Museum of Heavy Magic were most widespread across the Eastern Heartlands and north Faer√ªn, particularly among the northern Chondathans and Vaasans."
