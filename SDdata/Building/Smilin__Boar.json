        "mainbody": "The '''Smilin' Boar''' was a restaurant located in the well-off neighborhood of [[Bloomridge]], in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and operated by a [[Strongheart halfling|halfling]] named [[Jentha Allinamuch]].\n\nAs per the name, the restaurant's signboard featured a smiling [[boar]] that had taken mount atop a sow.",
        "Services": "The menu of the Boar featured renamed, bawdier versions of traditional breakfast dishes. such as \"sow's delight\" and \"three pigs in a blanket\". [[Coffee]] and [[tea]] were served in [[mug]]s that were shaped like a [[pig]]'s head. Many believed this was done to cause a stir within the rather prim community members of the affluent Baldurian neighborhood.",
        "History": "Before it was a restaurant, the Smilin' Boar was a rather unsuccessful tavern. The owner Jentha renovated the building to offer a view of [[Gray Harbor]] and played up the establishment's quirky name. By [[1482 DR]], the Boar had become one of the trendiest caf√©s in Baldur's Gate.\n\nSome time around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, dead bodies began to appear in the alley behind the Smilin' Boar. With over a dozen corpses being found over the course of six months, business at the restaurant decreased dramatically. While the [[Cult of the Dead Three]] was responsible for these mortifying actions, locals believed it to be the actions of an individual they dubbed the \"Sickle Man\"."
