The '''Jagged Rocks''' was a temple dedicated to [[Umberlee]] located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far western corner of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] along [[Teshwave Street]] and [[Mace Way]].

==Description==
The exterior of the temple was shaped by craftsmen to resemble a rocky outcropping similar to what would be found along a shore. A shining light, symbolizing a lighthouse, sat at the apex.

==Activities==
Services were held daily at high tide. Special occasions took place during savage storms. Since Zhentil Keep was spending a good amount of coin and time rebuilding its navy after the city's destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the temple saw a steady influx of recent converts eager to appease the Bitch Queen.

==Inhabitants==
The High Priestess of the temple in {{Yearlink|1369}} was [[Stormmistress]]. She was assisted by six priestesses.
