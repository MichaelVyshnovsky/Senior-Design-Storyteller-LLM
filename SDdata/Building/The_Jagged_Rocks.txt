The Jagged Rocks was a temple dedicated to Umberlee located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far western corner of the Foreign Quarter along Teshwave Street and Mace Way.

Services were held daily at high tide. Special occasions took place during savage storms. Since Zhentil Keep was spending a good amount of coin and time rebuilding its navy after the citys destruction in the , the temple saw a steady influx of recent converts eager to appease the Bitch Queen.
The High Priestess of the temple in  was Stormmistress. She was assisted by six priestesses.
