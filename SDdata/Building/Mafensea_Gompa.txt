'''Mafensea Gompa''' was a [[monastery]] (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It was found in the south of Tabot.

==Description==
[[Pang]] of [[Pokarr Gompa]] dismissed Mafensea, [[Jo'nai Gompa|Jo'nai]], and [[Lo'S'sem Gompa]]s as "all alike", with "primitive and gaudy" ceremonies.

==History==
It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Mafensea.

''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Mafensea was among those southern monasteries opposing the northern monasteries in the yig-tsang (monk council) of Tabot.
