        "mainbody": "he Dragonwing Chamber was a chamber within the Palace of the Purple Dragon in Cormyr.\nThe ceiling of the chamber had a beautiful, luxurious carving of two dragons.\nAfter capturing Narnra Shalace, Glarasteer Rhauligan brought her to the Dragonwing Chamber for Caladnei to interrogate. When she came to, she entertained herself briefly by contemplating the roof of the chamber, and what it represented.\nShe agreed later to be mind-reamed while in the chamber the backlash from Caladnei and Laspeeras mind-reaming was intense enough to reach outside the chamber, where Huldyl Rauthur, a turncoat and War Wizard, accidentally eavesdropped some details of the reaming. She was hired as a spy after the reaming shortly after she left the chamber with her first assignment, Glarasteer was commanded to shadow and protect her."
