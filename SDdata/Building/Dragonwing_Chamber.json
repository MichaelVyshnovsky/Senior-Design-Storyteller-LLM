When she came to, she entertained herself briefly by contemplating the roof of the chamber, and what it represented.\n\nShe agreed later to be mind-reamed while in the chamber; the backlash from Caladnei and [[Laspeera]]'s mind-reaming was intense enough to reach outside the chamber, where [[Huldyl Rauthur]], a turncoat and [[War Wizard]], accidentally eavesdropped some details of the reaming.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|289-290|18}} She was hired as a spy after the reaming; shortly after she left the chamber with her first assignment, Glarasteer was commanded to shadow and protect her.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|296-297|18}}"
