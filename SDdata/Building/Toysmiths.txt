The '''Toysmiths''' was a renowned and prosperous toy shop in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and operated by a pair of [[gnome]] brothers, [[Gunder Gaewilder|Gunder]] & [[Relvan Gaewilder]].{{Cite polyhedron/50/The Living City: The Toysmiths|10}}

==Location==
This shop was located [[Hearthston Hill]], in the [[Mortonbrace]] Neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Uptown District|Uptown District]] of Ravens Bluff.{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Structure==
This building stood a single story tall and had a window providing a view into its showroom.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Swearing Stone|8}} Overall the building didn't stand out a lot from the others that stood along Hearthston Hill.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Sel没ne|7}}

===Interior===
[[File:Toysmiths Layout.png|thumb|370px|''The floor plan for the Toysmiths.'']]
The front door of Toysmiths opened directly into its showroom, where all manner of toys covered the walls, crowded the corners,{{Cite polyhedron/50/The Living City: The Toysmiths|11}}

Past the office room was the workshop proper, where the Gaewilder brothers crafted their toys. The rooms was a cluttered mess, with tables often covered in various tools and partially finished creations, as well as some magical supplies like ''[[oil of slipperiness]]'' or ''[[sovereign glue]]''. Beyond the workshop was a kitchen, two bedrooms, and entryway to a connected stable that housed Toysmiths' two [[horse]]s and its bright red horse cart.

The bed chambers of Relvan was decorated lavishly in bright colors, excluding anything red, and adorned with a great deal of toys. By comparison, the room of Gunder was rather spartan in appearance. Along the west wall was a large metal depiction of the symbol of [[Flandal Steelskin]], a fiery hammer, where he would pray for his [[divine]] [[spell]]s. Within a small desk lit by [[oil lamp]] Gunder kept [[book]]s on craftsmanship, religion, and gnome history. In the desk's bottom drawer was kept a small [[iron]] lockbox, trapped by Gunder with a electrical ''[[glyph of warding]]'', that stored the business's profits.

Every night Relvan set up a rudimentary security system in the showroom. This consisted of a tripwire across that ground that, when triggered, would cause four [[toy soldier]]s wielding little [[crossbow]]s to fire [[dart]]s laced in a paralytic [[poison]]. Additional doses of this same poison were kept in a [[vial]] by Gunder within his bedroom.

==Services==
Toysmiths specialized in selling a wide variety of different toys that were all made on site, catering to both commoners and the rich.{{Cite organized play/LC/Tears of Sel没ne|23}}<ref group="note" name="Aurora">With some exceptions, most of these toys outlined in ''Tears of Sel没ne'' match up with ones previously detailed in ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.

The ''Avatar'' series was a line of 55 figures that each depicted one of the known [[deities]] of the Realms. Out of these fifty five, three were different versions of [[Bane]] and two were different versions of [[Torm]]. Figures could be purchased individually for 8 [[silver piece]]s, or they could all be bought together as a full set for 20 [[gold piece]]s. The other notable line of figures was the ''[[Heroes of the Realms]]'',It is left unclear in this case if "Gods of the Realms" meant the line depicted deities from all across [[Toril]] or was limited solely to the known gods of [[Faer没n]]. a line of [[clay]] figures depicting various renowned [[adventurer]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/Fire's Eye|9}} Each figure was custom made and sold for 3 gold pieces.

Among the most expensive of the Gaewilder products, as well as the most sought after by adults of nobility, were their intricate [[clockwork toy]]s. Crafted of [[gold]] and inlaid with precious [[gemstone]]s

==Activities==
Though the business was quite prosperous, it frequently had surpluses of unsold toys. It was for this reason, according to the Gaewilder brothers, that several times a year they would load up their horse cart with the surplus stock they didn't have room for and ride through the city to give the toys out. This was usually done during a festival or holiday. Both of the Gaewilders would dress themselves up in bright [[makeup]] and colorful costumes for the occasion. And Relvan would go a step further by putting on a performance of dancing, juggling, and acrobatic tricks to delight the onlookers.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1341 DR]],In ''The Swearing Stone'', an adventure estimated to take place in 1371 DR because it's set 13 years after the [[Time of Troubles]], it is stated that the Gaewilder brothers have been in business for thirty years. This would put the opening of their shop at roughly 1341 DR. on either [[Eleasis 1]] or [[Shieldmeet]],A lot of the events in the adventure ''The Swearing Stone'' center around a Shieldmeet celebration that occurred two weeks prior, which just so happened to fall on the anniversary of the opening of Toysmiths. ''The Swearing Stone'' takes place in 1371 DR, however, Shieldmeet only occurs once every 4 years and it's known from other material that a Shieldmeet celebration had occurred in the year [[1372 DR]]. If one were to assume that Ravenians celebrate Shieldmeet regardless of year or that this was a special occurrence, then the actual date would likely be Elasias 1. Alternatively, if one were to assume that the adventure's date is wrong and should be 1372 DR, then Toysmiths was instead opened on Shieldmeet in [[1340 DR]]. Toysmiths was established by the Gaewilders after Gunder left the [[Church of Flandal Steelskin]] in response to being ridiculed by his fellow Flandalians for his focus on toysmithing.

For a time it was considered quite fashionable among [[Cormyrean]] nobles to gift King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] one of the intricate clockwork toys crafted by the Gaewilder brothers of Ravens Bluff, until Azoun himself grew tiresome of the fad and would sigh loudly whenever he was presented with another.

In [[1369 DR]],<ref group="note" name="date3">The article about the Toysmiths in [[Polyhedron 50|''Polyhedron'' #50]] states that the Toysmiths began 28 years prior. Taking into account the prior dating estimates, that would put the "Present" of that article at 1369 DR. the earnings of the Toysmiths totaled at 4,346 gold pieces. Around that time the Gaewilders notably had in their possession two gold [[lion]] ''[[figurines of wondrous power]]'' of their own creation, though Gunder would try to take sole credit for their creation whenever his brother wasn't present. The Gaewilders sought to sell the figures for no less than 5,000 gold pieces, but chose not to publicly advertise them, only showing them off to customers who inquired about [[magic item]]s and looked like they could afford the steep cost. For safekeeping these figurines were kept within an iron lockbox, trapped by Gunder with a ''glyph of warding'' that would cause electrical shocks, and kept within one of their office desk's drawers.

In [[1371 DR]], on a Shieldmeet celebration, the Gaewilders celebrated the 30{{th}} anniversary of their business together by making a pledge at the famed [[Swearing Stone]] to continue their partnership for another thirty year.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Swearing Stone|2}}

This chaos corruption made Relvan start to think he wanted out of toysmithing, driving him to sell the shop to an interested buyer and lie that his brother was dead. An equally mind corrupted Gunder was outraged by his brothers actions and decided to hold him hostage within the store until either his Relvan changed his mind or he could convince the interested buyer in backing out of the deal. He adhered Relvan to a table with ''sovereign glue'', tied his hands together with ribbon, scattered jacks and [[marbles]] across the floor, and wrapped around his nose the tripwire for his nightly toy soldier trap. He also barred the front door to their shop and had their guard dog sat on the table beside his brother.

A large crowd came to gather outside the shop to gawk at the situation. Lieutent [[Veriway]] of the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]]'s [[I&N Team]], lacking resources to check out the premises, tried to negotiate Relvan's safe release. Eventually a group of [[adventurer]]s investigating the Swearing Stone came by the shop and overheard Gunder talking about the anniversary meeting.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Swearing Stone|9}}

The adventurers would manage to talk him down into releasing his brother, but the moment Gunder left the store Veriway sneered at him, calling the gnome an "idiot" that wasn't going to get his store back. He then called upon fellow guardsman to arrest Gunder, proclaiming he was going to be sent away to the [[Golden Ball]]. Some of the adventurers tried to protest his arrest, but Veriway told them to take it up with Lord Magistrate [[Tordon Sureblade]].

==Inhabitants==
Both brothers equally contributed to the crafting of toys. Relvan, the younger of the two brothers, was arguably the better craftsman and put the finishing touch on almost everything they made. He was disinterested in most business details though and trusted his brother Gunder to keep track of all such matters, including record keeping and the holding of the Toysmiths's earnings.

Besides the brothers themselves, the store was inhabited by a [[animal skeleton|animated skeleton]] of a [[war dog]]. This creature had been reanimated by Gunder and put inside of a large stuffed dog, acting as a covert guard animal. It typically stood within the showroom, near the door to office during business hours and in the middle of the showroom at night or whenever both brothers were away from the shop. Inside the stables of the Toysmiths were a draft horse [[dye]]d blue, named Sir Blue, and a [[pony]] named Hazelnut. The Gaewilders usually kept around {{SI|15|lb|k}} sacks of high quality [[oat]]s for the two.

==Reputation==
The Toysmiths was well beloved by many generations of Ravenians, so much so that any attempts to burglarize or vandalize the shop would swiftly be met with mass intervention from the locals. Even if one could manage to steal from the shop, its merchandise was so distinctive that it could easily be traced back to the [[thieves]] who fenced it.

The masterful craftsmanship of the the brothers also made Toysmiths renowned far beyond the confines of Ravens Bluff and [[the Vast]], being known as far away as [[Cormanthor]] and [[Rashemen]]. Both [[Sembian]] and [[Waterdhavian]] nobles frequently paid Toysmiths large sums of gold for its clockwork toys. And tales of their craftsmanship caused travelers from even farther afield to visit Ravens Bluff to get a look at the Gaewilders' work.
