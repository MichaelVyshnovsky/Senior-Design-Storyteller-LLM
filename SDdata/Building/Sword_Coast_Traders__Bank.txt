The Sword Coast Traders Bank was a banking business in Daggerford that offered money-lending and secured storage to the merchants and traders that came through town. It was owned by Lady Belinda of the noble Anteos family of Waterdeep.
It was located on the southern side of the Money Quarter on Horse Way.
The bank was established within a well-secured building.
Around the , the bank offered a fairly straightforward service. Individuals could deposit their hard-earned coin within the secured building and withdraw the same amount in one of the nearby metropolises of Baldurs Gate or Waterdeep. Information about the amounts of transactions and the banks clientele were kept secret and only sent to the other cities by magically safeguarded means.
The Sword Coast Traders Bank sought to offer loans to Daggerfords citizens, using the wealth they kept secured away within the bank. This aspect of the business was less successful however, as the people of the town preferred to work with their local acquaintances.
The establishment of this business was heartily endorsed by the towns leader Duke Maldwyn Daggerford.
