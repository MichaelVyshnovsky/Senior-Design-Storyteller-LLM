        "mainbody": "The '''Moonstone Manse''' was a 14{{th}}-century school of the [[the Art|arcane arts]] that was located in the [[Impiltur]]an city of [[Hlammach]]. It was seen as the lesser of the two [[magic]] academies of the realm, inferior to the well-renowned [[Towers of the Wind]] located in nearby [[Lyrabar]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",
        "Description": "Founded in the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]] by [[Plathyon Hawkryn]], the school educated a few select pupils on the [[gem magic|magical relationship]] between the [[Weave]] and the naturally-occurring [[gem]]s and other precious stones of [[Toril]]. Their lessons specifically focused on [[moonstone]]s, the [[feldspar]] from which the school drew its name.\n\nSome believed that the school's founding was merely an action taken by the noble [[Hawkryn]] to further increase their wealth, as they owned a number of abundant moonstone mines within the [[Earthfast Mountains]]."
