The '''Drakelight''' was a lighthouse located in [[Threskel]] in the [[Old Empires]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Drakelight stood on the outward tip of [[Watchers' Cape]] overlooking the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] in northwest Threskel.

==Activities==
The lighthouse was lit whenever pirates were spotted entering the [[Bay of Chessenta]]. This massive lighthouse stood {{SI|800|ft|long=yes}} tall.

==Defenses==
In order to protect the Drakelight from pirate retaliation, [[Soorenar]], [[Luthcheq]], and [[Mordulkin]] each sent a detachment of one hundred soldiers to garrison the lighthouse. The soldiers stationed here were sworn to work together even if their parent cities were at war with each other.
