The Lockup was a prison owned by the Crown of Cormyr and the Purple Dragons of Suzail in the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr.
The Lockup stood just outside the Citadel of the Purple Dragonss gate in the southeastern part of Suzail. It was located on the street that stretched from the Market Hall on the Coachwheels Way and the citys Market Yard.
The prison was a notably unfriendly, almost square stone building that loomed over the street. Its edifice was decorated with carved statues of Purple Dragon Knights. The Lockup was usually used to keep suspects and criminals as they waited for a trial as well as convicted wrongdoers.
*Some said that Purple Dragon Knight statues could be animated by the Lockups warden with a single command in case of riots and unrest.
