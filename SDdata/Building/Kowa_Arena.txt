The '''Kowa Arena''' was a venue for wrestling in the city of [[Jasuga]] in [[Wa]].

==Location==
The wrestling arena was located in the center of the city in a cluster of residential neighborhoods, north of [[Shun Lake]] and the city's military compound. The wrestlers lived and trained west of the arena.

==Activities==
The area served as the home for the city's wrestling competitions and tournaments and was heavily guarded.

==History==
Ever since the establishment of an annual wrestling tournament at the arena in Jasuga, the populace hoped that the sport would catch on in the rest of the country, leading to respect toward the city. The rest of Wa, however, was slow to show interest.
