The '''Lady Murmurs Yes''' was a club where people of means could hire companionship for a night, located in [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The ''Lady Murmurs Yes'' stood two blocks east of the [[Horngate]], along Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]]. The brothel was known for its ladies "not sporting a face like an old boot" whose companionship was priced at ten [[lion (coin)|lions]] and twenty more for a night-long affair and a choice of activities that did not include flogging.
