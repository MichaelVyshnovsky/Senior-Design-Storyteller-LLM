        "Structure": "The Thundersword family was the third major noble family in the city of [[Immersea]], and the castle they erected was the newest and largest among their peers: the families of [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur]], and [[Cormaeril]]. Unlike them, however, Thundersword House was built outside the borders of Immersea, to the southwest of the Wyvernspurs' [[Redstone Castle]] and their farmlands. Thundersword House stood on a small wooded knoll in its own small valley."
