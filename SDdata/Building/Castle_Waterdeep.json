        "mainbody": "'''Castle Waterdeep''' was a castle located in the city of [[Waterdeep]]. It was the seat of the city's government.",
        "Defenses": "[[File:Castle Waterdeep.jpg|thumb|right|''Castle Waterdeep at sunset.'']]\nIts walls were 60-ft-thick (18 m) on average, and high enough that when banners were displayed in honor of visiting parties, they were visible from many areas of the southern city.\n\nThe road up to the castle's main entrance was steep-sided and winding, with towers guarding it at regular points.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|7}}",
        "Interior": "Most of the castle's passageways were permanently lit by ''[[continual light]]'' spells.",
        "Supplies": "The castle held enough food to feed 50,000 people for ten days, and could accommodate up to 540 prisoners in 90 cells. There were many dungeons beneath the castle, mainly used for storage, which linked through to the [[Citadel of the Bloody Hand]], creating a security concern. There were also deep wells beneath the castle that provided clean drinking water.",
        "Personnel": "The castle was garrisoned by 1,400 of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], who, along with members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], were trained in its courtyard. Seventy [[Horse#Terms|warhorses]] were kept in the castle stables. Thirty guards were always armed and keeping watch on the battlements, while twenty crossbowmen and two wizards were always on duty in a guardroom close to the castle gates.",
        "Activities": "The battlements of Castle Waterdeep were used for the hanging of non-nobles.",
        "History": "Work began on the castle in the [[963 DR|Year of the Thundering Horde, 963 DR]], outside and to the north of the city walls. It was finished on [[Higharvestide]], the [[974 DR|Year of the Haunting Harpy, 974 DR]], the same year [[Laroun]] rose to War Lord.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], a party was held at Castle Waterdeep in honor of a [[Shar|supposed avatar]] of the goddess [[Sel√ªne]]. It was attended by Lord [[Piergeiron]], [[Khelben Arunsun]], [[Tertius Wands]], [[Mirt]] and [[Asper]], and [[Fenn Estelmer]] and [[Kyriani]], who came to investigate the avatar. However, a trio of the [[Dark Army of the Night]] crashed the party and made a failed attempt to kidnap the avatar, before they were arrested by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. Kyriani later confronted the avatar in the castle kitchens, but the two fought a [[spell]]-battle that spilled out into the corridor before Lord Piergeiron intervened. Khelben helped Kyriani escape with a ''[[passwall]]'' through the castle walls. Dramatically, she leaped out of the cliff-side castle and was caught by her lover [[Rellamyn]] on his [[asperii|flying horse]]. He and his companions swooped the castle, dodged flaming arrows from its defenders, before they departed.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon}}\n\nAs of [[1372 DR]], it had long since been inside the city walls."
