The Wyverns Rest was an inn and tavern located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The inn was located in the far northwest corner of Waterdeeps Sea Ward on the southeast corner of the intersection of Aureenar Street with the Street of the Singing Dolphin. The back of the building touched Sabbars Alley.
Originally constructed as a stone watch house, the Wyverns Rest was a favorite of guards and watchmen. The building stood two stories tall. A large stuffed wyvern was hung over the bar.
A hunchback named Murklar was the janitor of the inn.
