        "mainbody": "erpentspires was a fine dining hall, dancing hall, and festhall on the Dragoneyes Street that belonged to Onharr the Scalebright in the days before the Weeping War.\nThe hall was located in the citys Cormanthor ward, on Berduins Ride.\nIn 1369 DR, only a half of the structure was still standing with its western half gone. The eastern half of the Serpentspires went up two floor. The interior of the building had wide open spaces and large open windows. One small tower and two thin taller spires rose above the undamaged half of Serpentspires with the shirt tower-top decorated with brightly polished steel shingles. The thin spires were decorated and paint with a snake-like motif.\nThe remnants of the second floor were crumbling into the wide open dance space on the first floor. The same open area became populated with ghostly phantoms during the nights of the new moon. They could be seen gracefully gliding across the floor in dance, and sitting along the dining tables. They did not respond to interactions, magic, nor attacks and likely were psychic echoes of the past protected by the mythals magic.\nThese ghostly echoes of the past swirled into beautiful dance when the music was playing. This dance created a hypnotic pattern of sorts that affected demons of all kind that happen to witness the event. This dance mesmerized said creatures sometimes for many hours. This condition lasted indefinitely until the dance ended or the demons were attacked.\nIn 714 DR, when the Army of Darkness broke through the citys defenses and poured into Cormanthyr, enchanter Onharr the Scalebright stood up to defend his festhall and got into a spell-slinging battle with a powerful mezzoloth Yekschanivosk, the Bearer of a Hundred Screaming Skulls. That was the reason for Serpentspires destroyed western half.\nMany adventurers who scavenged through the dangerous ruins of Myth Drannor claimed that Yekschanivosk was not destroyed nor banished during the Weeping War, but instead trapped inside a magical ruby as big as a gnomes fist. The legend said that the mezzoloth was to grant a wish to anyone brave enough to smash its prison freeing the demon. The scavengers supposed that the magical ruby was lost somewhere in Serpentspires cellars guarded by long-spoiled numerous caskets of magical wine that was animated by the wild magics of the War and mythal, turning it into hungry corrosive ooze-like creatures."
