        "mainbody": "he Misty Beard was a tavern located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe exterior sign hanging above the main door depicted a bearded sailor with thick beads of water glistening like a rainbow throughout his beard. The droplets of water in the beard were actually enchanted to make them sparkle in the light.\nThe four-story stone building feature large arched windows and downspouts carved to resemble alluring winged maidens.\nThe tavern was found in the eastern section of Waterdeeps North Ward along the east side of Saerdoun Street just north of Endcliff Tower and in between Sulmor Street and Hassantyrs Street.\nPart of what made the Misty Beard famous up and down the Sword Coast was the staff which was composed of exotic or monstrous creatures from all over Faer√ªn. Examples included lizard men, myconids, faerie dragons, and even a few skeletons and zombies controlled by other members of the staff. Other members of the staff were shapeshifters or used illusion magic to alter their appearance, leaving patrons amazed since they never knew what they would see when walking through the front door.\nMost of the waiters were usually winged sprites hired for a month at a time, after which point they were usually sick of the city and left.\nThe tavern was owned by a pair of half-elven sisters named Allet and Vindara Tzuntzin. The bartender was a fearless lizardman named Munzrim Marlpar. Munzrim could usually be found talking with a spectator called Thoim Zalamm.\nThe Misty Beard was famous for its garlic butter and gooseberry jam. The fruit used for the same was grown on the owners farm outside of the city.\nThe Misty Beard was first established as a tavern by the name of the Cat and Songbird. The owners at that time, both members of the thieves guild, perished during an assassination attempt on one of Waterdeeps Lords."
