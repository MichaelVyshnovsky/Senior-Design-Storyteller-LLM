        "mainbody": "The House of the Moon was a large temple of Selûne in Thentia.\nThe temple was located towards the inland, northern side of Thentia, on a main road running towards the coast.\nThe temple was built from white marble and alabaster with silver trim. The domed, vaulted ceiling of the sanctuary was a painted midnight blue field with dramatic depictions of the lunar phases.\nIn 1194 DR, the temple performed an inquest into the deaths of three priestesses in Glister who were suspected of being part of the New Moon Heresy. The sisters Fela, Iwna, and Mirela Thesk were cleared of all suspicions and declared innocent.\nIn 1345 DR it became the sole major temple in Thentia when the Zhentarim blew up the temple of Waukeen during a heist.\nAround 1376 DR, the temple experienced a surge in popularity as witnesses claimed to see Selûne gliding above the waves of the sea, and sailors who defended her name in brawls received a glowing boon on their weapons.\nIn 1376 DR the temple was overseen by Sureene Aumratha and 34 lesser priests and priestesses. She was also assisted by two sorcerous sisters, Jannatha Goldenshield and Baerimel Dunnath, who performed investigations for Sureene."
