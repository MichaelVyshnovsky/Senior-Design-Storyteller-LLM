        "mainbody": "The '''Water Queen's House''' was a temple of [[Umberlee]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the city's oldest temple\n and one of the only true temples to the Sea Queen in the Realms at the time, thanks to the tolerance and openness of the Baldurians. The name was said to be a euphemism.",
        "Location": "[[File:Bloomridge.jpg|thumb|''The location of the Water Queen's House.'']]\nIt was located in the northern docklands along the waterfront.",
        "History": "Established some time before [[1358 DR]],\n\nBy the end of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Water Queen's House, under the leadership of the Flood Tide [[Allandra Grey]], planned to have enough money to purchase [[Nurthammas]] family's shipping yard. The church believed that the docking dues had been too generous. With the temple's control of Baldur Gate's docks, tariffs would be increased and the city's wealth would eventually rival that of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Inhabitants": "[[File:Water Queen's House.png|thumb|''A statue depicting Umberlee, as seen in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].'']]\nAt the time, [[Jalantha Mistmyr]] was the lead Storm-Priestess of this temple to the Bitch Queen and she was aided by eight zealous priestesses and sixteen followers.\n\nAs of [[1482 DR]], Allandra Grey served as Flood Tide of the temple, and led about twenty priestesses, called waveservants."
