        "Structure": "From the battlements atop the fort, the whole of the Harbor Ward was clearly visible.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|21}} Meanwhile, a [[dungeon]] beneath the fort was used by the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] to store important or [[curse]]d treasure.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|22}}",

A [[winch]] in the fort could raise this chain to completely both access into or out of the harbor. This was raised when the harbor came under attack or when criminals attempted to flee the Harbor Ward by ship.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|6}}",
        "History": "The harbor of Port Nyanzaru was built explicitly with defense in mind. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it had been several decades since the fort had needed to raise the chain to defend the harbor from an attack.\n\nWhen Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish pirate [[Idrianne Smoke]] during the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} the merchant prince [[Ekene-Afa]] ordered the fort to bombard her flagship, the ''[[Banshee (ship)|Banshee]]''.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|16}}",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the fort was occupied by mercenaries loyal to the merchant princes. The garrison consisted of forty guards led by four officers and a [[castellan]]."
