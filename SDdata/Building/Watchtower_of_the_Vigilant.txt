The '''Watchtower of the Vigilant''' was a [[temple]] dedicated to [[Helm]] and located in [[Harkstag]] during the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Watchtower was a small temple located in a small village near [[Serpent's Cowl]]. It came to prominence during the {{yearlinkName|1265}}, for hosting the [[Council of Helm]] that resulted in the creation of the [[Vigilant Riders]].

The temple was destroyed alongside the rest of the village during a [[green dragon]] attack in the {{yearlinkName|1279}}. During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], its ruins served as a hideout for [[yuan-ti]] of [[Najara]].
