        "mainbody": "'''Tanalar's Fine Mounts''' was a horsebreeder and trader in [[Tilverton]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], run by the [[Purple Dragons|ex-Purple Dragon]] [[Brieth Tanalar]].",
        "Location": "Tanalar's office in Tilverton lay along the [[Moonsea Ride]] halfway between the Market and the Cormyr Gate.",
        "Services": "Tanalar bred and sold fine mounts that were used as racehorses, riding horses, medium warhorses, and studs, with customers as far away as [[Calimshan]]. His prices were high, but he knew that he could charge what he liked due to the quality of his horseflesh. He would also refuse to deal with anyone he didn't like the look of, with a strong distrust of strangers, as many assumptive merchants discovered."
