        "mainbody": "he Fortress of the Half-Demon was a ruined stone fort located north of Rashemen. It was built in antiquity by the Nar people and had a huge iron gate fashioned into the face of a leering demon. One of the gates was half-open, thereby the name \"Half-Demon\". The fortress was square in shape and had a huge stone keep in the center of the courtyard. Underneath the fortress were a huge number of catacombs and passages, at least some of which lead to pocket planes which were used as extra burial space long ago.\nAs of 1372 DR, the fortress was the home of marauders led by the hagspawn Losk who would attack travelers along the nearby Long Road to the north.\nIn 1479 DR a group of undead Durthan allied with an unknown force, possibly Nar, used the fortress as their base of operations.  An army consisting of Rashemi berserkers and fey and led by Aoth Fezim attacked the fortress and drove the Durthan and their undead minions into the tunnels under the fort in the Battle of the Fortress of the Half-Demon."
