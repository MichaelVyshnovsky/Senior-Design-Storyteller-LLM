        "mainbody": "The Spiders Net was an expensive tavern located in Sloopdilmonpolop.\nThe tavern was popular with the drow caravans that frequented the settlement. As a result, the taverns menu was designed around the drow palate and consisted entirely of seafood. A salty wine, made from the waters of the River of Brine mixed with fish oil and the juice from fermented mushrooms, was the house specialty."
