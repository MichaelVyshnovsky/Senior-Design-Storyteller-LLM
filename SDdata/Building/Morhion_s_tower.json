        "mainbody": "he Morhions tower was a laboratory tower in Iriaebor owned by the mage Morhion Gendahar in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe tower stood on the Street of Runes, close to the High Altar of the Moon, on the eastern side of the Tor.\nThe tower looked like it had crumbled years before, the roof was caved in, and dead vines hung from the tower walls. However, the tower was actually covered in an illusion, making it only look like it was dilapidated.\nThe tower has many floors. Morhions study was an octagonal chamber at the top of the tower. Tidy bookshelves stood along the walls and the floors were covered with intricate Sembian rugs. The chamber had a hearth and it was lit by dozens of candles and scented with dried herbs that provided a faint, sweet, dusty fragrance. In the room there was a table of polished rosewood.\nBelow the tower, there was a magical portal. It was made by a powerful conjurer who dwelt in the tower many years before. The portal was in a circular room made of stone."
