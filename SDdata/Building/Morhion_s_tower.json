        "mainbody": "The '''Morhion's tower''' was a laboratory tower in [[Iriaebor]] owned by the mage [[Morhion Gen'dahar]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The tower stood on the Street of Runes, close to the [[High Altar of the Moon]], on the eastern side of the Tor.",
        "Structure": "The tower looked like it had crumbled years before, the roof was caved in, and dead vines hung from the tower walls. However, the tower was actually covered in an [[illusion]], making it only look like it was dilapidated.<ref>",
        "Interior": "The tower has many floors. Morhion's study was an octagonal chamber at the top of the tower. Tidy bookshelves stood along the walls and the floors were covered with intricate [[Sembia]]n rugs. The chamber had a hearth and it was lit by dozens of [[candle]]s and scented with dried [[herb]]s that provided a faint, sweet, dusty fragrance. In the room there was a table of polished rosewood.<ref>\n\nBelow the tower, there was a magical portal. It was made by a powerful [[conjurer]] who dwelt in the tower many years before. The portal was in a circular room made of stone.<ref>"
