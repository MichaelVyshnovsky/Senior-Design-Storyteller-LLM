The '''Beckoning Tower of Shoon''', which was previously called the '''Beacon Tower of Shoon''', was a lighthouse constructed on the largest rock within the [[Beacon Rocks]] formation on the [[Great Sea]] southwest of [[Samarach]].

==Description==
The Beckoning Tower of Shoon stood {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall with a diameter of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}. A wooden door was found along the base which led to a stairway along the outer wall that provided access to all three levels of the tower. A ''[[continual flame]]'' effect adorned the top of the tower and was visible for miles in every direction.

==History==
The lighthouse was constructed during the reign of [[Shoon IV]]. Some time after the fall of the [[Shoon Imperium]], an unknown [[wizard]] placed an enchantment upon the tower. The enchantment behaved like a ''[[sympathy]]'' [[spell]], luring any [[human]]s toward the tower like moths to a flame. Once a beacon of safety, the Beckoning Tower of Shoon later was a dangerous trap that caused many sailors to dash their ships against the rocks.
