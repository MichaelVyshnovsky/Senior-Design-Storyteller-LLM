The Beckoning Tower of Shoon, which was previously called the Beacon Tower of Shoon, was a lighthouse constructed on the largest rock within the Beacon Rocks formation on the Great Sea southwest of Samarach.
The Beckoning Tower of Shoon stood  tall with a diameter of . A wooden door was found along the base which led to a stairway along the outer wall that provided access to all three levels of the tower. A continual flame effect adorned the top of the tower and was visible for miles in every direction.
The lighthouse was constructed during the reign of Shoon IV. Some time after the fall of the Shoon Imperium, an unknown wizard placed an enchantment upon the tower. The enchantment behaved like a sympathy spell, luring any humans toward the tower like moths to a flame. Once a beacon of safety, the Beckoning Tower of Shoon later was a dangerous trap that caused many sailors to dash their ships against the rocks.
