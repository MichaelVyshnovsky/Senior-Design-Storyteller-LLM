        "mainbody": "The '''Steps of Istishia''' was the most impressive structure within the city of [[Keltar]].\n\nThis monolithic shrine to the [[Istishia|Water Lord]] was built thousands of years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Water from the [[Calim River]] was diverted by sluice gate and pumped to the top of the structure by hidden [[screw pump]]s. The water was then magically guided down the monolith in four stair-like patterns to reach a pool of water surrounding the Steps. To ensure that this pool of water was always clear and clean, it was magically returned to the river twice a day to be replaced with fresh water.",
