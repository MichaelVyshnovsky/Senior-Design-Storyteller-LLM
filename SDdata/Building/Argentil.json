        "mainbody": "'''Argentil''' was the palace of [[Sel没ne]], goddess of the [[moon]], in her planar realm known as the [[Gates of the Moon]]. It was also inhabited by [[Finder Wyvernspur]], god of art, around [[1372 DR]].",
        "Description": "Lying in the middle of the plane, Argentil was a vast hall fashioned of shining [[silver]]. It was a beautiful place, but quiet, where all sound seemed hushed. The ever-present moonlight hugged all beings and things, making them glow with a soft, silvery light.\n\nFrom the 1370s [[DR]], the hall was adorned all over with the artworks created by Finder's [[petitioner]]s. His own chambers enjoyed constant music.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], it was surrounded by [[Brightwater]], the city of [[Sune]], goddess of love.",
        "Features": "The [[Infinite Staircase]] appeared inside Argentil every full moon when fog rose from the water. This strange passage, extending up and down and in every other direction, was said to connect to every city in every plane and perhaps in every time. Traversing this mysterious conduit was known to be quite hazardous and unpredictable.<ref> Most of these allowed travel in only one direction. It was unclear why the Infinite Staircase was anchored in Sel没ne's residence and not some place else. It was possible this was due to [[Shaundakul]], god of travel, making his home in the Gates of the Moon, though he spent much time journeying elsewhere. [[Planewalker]]s came to the Gates of the Moon mostly only to use the Infinite Staircase.\n\nSel没ne was also known to keep portals to the [[astral dominion]]s of [[Arvandor]], the [[Deep Wilds]], the [[Green Fields]], and to the [[Feywild]]."
