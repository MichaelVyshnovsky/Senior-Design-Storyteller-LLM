        "mainbody": "The '''Stojanow Gate''' was a pair of massive iron-bound doors protecting [[Valjevo Castle]] on the city of [[Phlan]]. Flanked by towering gatehouses, the place served as the city's prison and as the headquarter of the [[Knights of the Black Fist]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|6-10}}",
        "Structure": "One of the oldest structures in Phlan, the Stojanow Gate was a monumental structure almost {{SI|60|feet|long=true}} high and {{SI|100|feet|long=true}} wide, which stretched all the way between two channels of the [[Stojanow River]]. Its {{SI|30|feet|long=true}} wide walls displayed breathtaking scenes featuring folk heroes, royalty, [[wizard]]s, [[dragon]]s and [[deities]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}}\n\nOn top of the walls, inhabitants could witness the dead bodies of criminals hung by the [[Black Watch]] feeding the city's [[raven]]s.",
        "Activities": "The gate served as a place to collect tolls, as well as keep prisoners and interrogate them. Prisoners held in the Gate's prison cells usually only stayed for a couple days before they were released&mdash;or hanged. An officer manning a desk outside the structure handled the demands and complaints of individuals asking for the release of their loved ones.",
        "Defenses": "While the Gate was built to defend Phlan's castle, it was actually kept open permanently, except in times of war.",
        "History": "During a surprise attack in the {{yearlinkName|902}}, [[Zhentarim]] forces managed to capture Stojanow Gate without a fight.\n\nFollowing the attack by [[Vorgansharax]] in the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, the [[Tears of Virulence]] managed to close the gate for the first time in more than a century.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|18}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": {
            "Origins": "The exact origins of the Stojanow Gate was unclear and subject to debates. According to [[bard]]ic tales the monument was built by [[fire giant]]s in tribute to ancient warrior kings, while some sages believed it was built by [[dwarves]] long ago."
