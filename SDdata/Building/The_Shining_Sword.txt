'''The Shining Sword''' was a magic store in [[Berdusk]], belonging to [[Tathtaklo Phaerdinzer]], as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The store was in [[Berdusk]].

==Services==
[[Tathtaklo Phaerdinzer]] sold the discards of adventurers, often magical, and sometimes crafted magical weapons of his own. Those weapons carried minor [[enchanted|enchantments]] such as [[blueshine]] or [[everbright]].

==History==
Early on, the shop had been investigated by the [[Harpers]] on suspicion that the owner requisitioned his wares from less-reputable sources.
