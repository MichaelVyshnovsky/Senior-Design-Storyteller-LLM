The Shining Sword was a magic store in Berdusk, belonging to Tathtaklo Phaerdinzer, as of the late 14 century DR.
The store was in Berdusk.
Tathtaklo Phaerdinzer sold the discards of adventurers, often magical, and sometimes crafted magical weapons of his own. Those weapons carried minor enchantments such as blueshine or everbright.
Early on, the shop had been investigated by the Harpers on suspicion that the owner requisitioned his wares from less-reputable sources.
