        "mainbody": "Starmeadow Tower, also known as Treetop, was a tower in Evereska and the home of the Nihmedu family.\nIt stood atop Goldmorn Knoll in the Starmeadow, amidst a large grove of rare sycamore trees that had migrated from Cormyr and took refuge in Evereska during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR.\nThe entry to the tower was a hole-shaped doorway  above ground. Visitors were meant to climb upâ€”the magic of the mythal meant that the bare skin of hands and feet stuck easily to the stone. This doorway led into the foyer.\nInside, the tower was airy and light, with softly glowing walls. The architecture was made up of smooth curves, and a swirling staircase connected each level. In the foyer, there were tables of translucent alabaster and white marble benches along the walls. Ethereal statuettes and vases with delicate embossments were displayed on these tables.\nThrough an archway off the foyer was a circular great room. This was where the Nihmedu family dined together, but rarely were enough of them present to fill the room.\nLeading off the dining room through a broad archway was \"the contemplation\", at the back of the tower. It had a theurglass window giving a view over the trees. It held a library, a reading stand, and a Reverie couch."
