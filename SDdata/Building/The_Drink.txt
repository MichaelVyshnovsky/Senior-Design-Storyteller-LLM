The Drink was a seedy tavern in Tilverton in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The tavern was smoky, stale and dim, with light provided by a few high windows and oil lamps, and fitted with wonky and warped furnishings. It was reasonably popular at night, but still very quiet.
The Drink was hidden in the dark back alleys of Tilverton.
The Drink was attended by the barfly Ponter and the professional thief and underworld agent Orrag.
