The '''Lorious Inn''', most often called just the '''Lorious''', was an upscale inn in [[Veltalar]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Lorious Inn was in [[Veltalar]].

==Structure==
The front door was wide.

==Interior==
The Lorious' entrance hall was packed with tables draped with red fabric. The saloon past the entrance hall had a bit of haze due to the burning incenses and pipes within the room. Within the Lorious, there were only magical lights.

The hallways leading to the rooms had golden lamps, and tapestries. There were plaques announcing the latter were looted from the ruins of [[Mulhorand]].

The lead-lined vaults had marble interiors.

==Services==
The Lorious was counted among the city's finer establishments; a day's stay cost five [[gold piece]]s at its rooms with adjoining lead-lined vaults, more than twice what other upscale suites cost.

==Defenses==
For those in dire need of privacy, and due to the volume of money that changed hands inside, the Lorious offered suites with lead-lined vaults.

==History==
In {{yearlink|1396}}, [[Japheth Donard]] rented a room at the Lorious Inn, where he kept the body of [[Anusha Marhana]] as he arranged to return her wandering soul to her.{{cite book/City of Torment|55-61|6}}
The three of them discussed their next move at the casino saloon afterwards.{{cite book/City of Torment|62-71|7}}
