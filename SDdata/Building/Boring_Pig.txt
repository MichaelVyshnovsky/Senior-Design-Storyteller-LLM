The '''Boring Pig''' was a small tavern of little note in the city of [[Voonlar]] in the [[Moonsea]] region.

==Location==
The tavern stood not far from the [[Bounty of the Goddess (Voonlar)|Bounty of the Goddess]] temple to [[Chauntea]].

==Interior==

The interior of the tavern was an open space filled with a varied collection of tables, stools, chairs, and benches. Huge [[keg]]s of alcohol stood along one of the walls of the drinking establishment, with a single bar standing at the opposite wall from the entrance. A red-faced inebriated bartender dressed in a stained [[apron]] could always be seen serving the [[ale]] and joking with patrons.

==History==
In the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Voonlar fell under a sudden [[fiend]]ish attack by the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]]. One such fiend—a [[green slaad]]—broke through the Pig's barred doors and started trashing the place. Thankfully the drunks were saved by an unlikely hero: an [[undead]] [[rogue]] named [[Lyressa]], who pounced on the creature's back and gave it a kiss of steel to all the patrons' rancorous approval.
