        "mainbody": "The '''lair of Lostmauth''' was the personal domain of [[Lostmauth]], one of the three [[red dragon]]s that ruled over the isle of [[Tuern]] throughout at least the 14{{th}}  and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Lostmauth made his lair within the depths of a grand temple that featured colossal statues of dragons built atop its walls. Within the main structure of the temple was a great circular platform. When activated, the platform would depress into the ground and open up into a deep chasm that descended to the subterranean chambers of the temple.\n\n[[File:Lostmauth Lair inner.png|thumb|right|300px|The interior of the temple within which Lostmauth stored his hoard.]]\nThe lower levels of the temple featured elaborate stone work left in a state of partial ruin. Magma from the volcanic core of Tuern flowed over crumbling walls and partially collapsed stone columns.\n\nLostmauth's inner sanctum lay within a structure built within the depths of Tuern's volcano. A pair of life-size statues of red dragons flanked either side of its entrance. Anyone entering within were witness to the great red dragon's massive hoard of wealth. Piles of [[currency|gold coin]]s lined the stone floors that surrounded a magma-lined, pentagonal dais.",
        "Geography": "The dragon's lair was situated both on top and within the volcanic isle of [[Tuern]].",
        "Defenses": "The entrance of the draconic temple was patrolled by his wardens, four [[iron golem|red iron golems]]. Numerous varieties of [[drake]]s could also be found both outside the temple and within its deeper levels.\n\nDragonhead statues spewing slow-moving [[fireball]]s lined the passageways of the subterranean depths of Lostmauth's lair.\n\nA pair of giant [[fire scorpion]]s served as the protectors of Lostmauth's innermost sanctum.",
        "History": "[[File:Lostmauth Lair sanctum.png|thumb|right|350px|A group of adventurers standing before Lostmauth within his innermost sanctum.]]\nDuring the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} Lostmauth granted the [[Cult of the Dragon]] admittance into his lair. After acquiring the ''[[Red Dragon Mask]]'', the cult's leader [[Severin Silrajin]] appeared before Lostmauth and the two appeared to strike a bargain. Severin offered Lostmauth some form of tribute and in return, the red dragon would destroy the city of [[Neverwinter]].\n\nFortunately for Neverwinter and its people, Lostmauth was slain shortly thereafter by a band of adventurers that included [[Alaeros Margaster]], [[Nymmestra Durothil]], [[Barrowin Undurr]], and [[Talon Everhale]].{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 4}}{{ToD-Lost}}",
