The '''Crypt of Anthilar''' was the legendary secret lair of the [[lich]] [[Anthilar]], known as the Archmage of [[Untisczer]].

==Location==
It was hidden in the mountains west of the [[Tashan Gap]] in the [[Tashalar]].

==History==
In the [[285 DR|Year of Wasteful Pride, 285 DR]], after the [[Shoon Imperium]] destroyed Untisczer, Anthilar escaped to his secret lair in the neighboring Tashalar. It was here that Anthilar transformed himself into an [[undead]] lich and plotted to covertly control the merchants of [[Tashluta]], until his capture there in the [[1056 DR|Year of the Laughing Dead, 1056 DR]].

By the 14{{th}} century DR, many adventurers had searched for the Crypt of Anthilar, but few, or none, were ever seen again.

==Rumours==
The lich's lair was reputed to hold the ''[[spellskins of Mhairshaulk]]'', which the adventurers hoped to recover.

It was supposed by some that Anthilar, though trapped, could manifest as a [[ghost]] from faraway and that he regularly returned to his lair to see that no-one trespassed there.
