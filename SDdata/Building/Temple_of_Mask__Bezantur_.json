        "mainbody": "he Temple of Mask was one of the most popular and prominent temples in Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\", in Thay. In addition to being the center of worship for the god Mask, it served as the headquarters of the citys powerful thieves guild.\nThe temple was located in the citys north just within the walls and just east of the North Gate.\nThe building was basically a fortress,\nThe building was basically a fortress, yet was barely defended. Most of the doors, including the exterior exits and the apartments of the inhabitants, were left unlocked. There were only a few human, orc, and ogre guards, and the guilds vault was guarded by just a single iron golem. The reason for this was a show of power by the thieves, who made sure that everyone in the city knew that no one should be stupid enough to steal something from the temple. Any burglar was instantly identified once they left the building&mdasheither by magic, by the guilds many contacts, or by bribed guards&mdashand was either dead or worse before the end of the day. Captured burglars were given to tanarri deep beneath the temple for torture and torment.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the temple was the only major public-facing center of Masks worship in Thay, while all other shrines were hidden or disguised.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the temple was managed and overseen by Shabella the Pale, who was also the Guildmistress of the thieves guild and was known to take a cut of the temple donations. She was considered the local high priestess, and she was subordinate to Thays high priest of Mask, who traveled the realm and only occasionally visited the temple. When the high priest was in town, they took over matters of faith."
