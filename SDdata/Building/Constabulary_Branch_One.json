The Chief of Constables [[Zacharia]] was assisted by the loyal and dutiful Underchiefs [[Chanteclaire]], [[Chantonay]], and [[Flamininus]]. Chantonay was responsible for protecting the building via magical and [[quasimagical item]]s, spells, and other magical effects, while Flamininus performed [[divination]]s and similar ''[[augury]]'' magics, using them to locate criminals and verify personal accounts during interviews and court proceedings.",
