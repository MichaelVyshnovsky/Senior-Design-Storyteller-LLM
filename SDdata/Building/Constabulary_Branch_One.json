        "mainbody": "Constabulary Branch One was the first of the three major watch headquarters of the Eileanar enclave of Netheril, alongside Branch Two and Branch Three.\nThe building was found on the northern rim of the enclave, handling the crimes in that region.\nThe ground floor of the building was partially publicly accessible, with three receptionists who handled and guided visitors. A large room behind the reception area held the desks, comfy chairs, filing cabinets, and crystal balls of twenty low-ranking constables who worked there when they werent out patrolling the streets.\nThe cellar level was made up of an expansive maze of 200 jail cells, with the entire level impossible to magically enter or exit, and causing incredibly dangerous backlash effects against teleportation magic.\nthumb|280px|The constables of the enclave.\nThe upper level of the structure was home to the offices of the highest-ranking constables and commissioners who reported directly to Karsus and his trusted followers such as Andoris Derathar. The Chief of Constables Zacharia was assisted by the loyal and dutiful Underchiefs Chanteclaire, Chantonay, and Flamininus. Chantonay was responsible for protecting the building via magical and quasimagical items, spells, and other magical effects, while Flamininus performed divinations and similar augury magics, using them to locate criminals and verify personal accounts during interviews and court proceedings.\nThe jail level of the building was extremely heavily warded against intrusion, thanks to one of Chatonays friends weaving a complex web of magical defenses. Magical infiltration was impossible, and teleportation was potentially subject to extreme backlash\n* Spell failure The spell failed and had no effect, sparing the caster from a worse fate.\n* Duo dimension The caster was subject to duo-dimension, else be briefly stunned and ricocheted.\n* Echo As the caster bounced off of the wards, a clone was generated that was typically sane though with a limited lifespan of several months. If the clone managed to kill the original it would become permanent, otherwise it dissipated once the magic ran out.\n* Reflection The caster was teleported up to  away from the jails in a random direction.\n* Refraction An extreme effect befell the interloper. This included a crippling magical injury, a forced reincarnation, a reversal of alignment, a sex change, a permanent weakening of ability, or a permanent boosting of ability while all their magical gear was sucked into the Negative Energy plane.\n* Ricochet The caster was transported to a new location according to the spell used. Intra-planar teleportation sent them to a random spot on Toril, while spells such as plane shift sent them to a random plane entirely.\nCategoryWatchhouses\nCategoryBarracks\nCategoryJails\nCategoryPrisons\nCategoryOfficial buildings\nCategoryBuildings\nCategoryLocations in Eileanar\nCategoryLocations in Netheril\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryYear of Metropolises\n9qeb11hllrwomge6c2r2h5iusbxbvu3"
