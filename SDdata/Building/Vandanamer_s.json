Across Galaglavur Street was [[Krostur's Forge]]. Next door, to the west, was the [[Maerador House of Welcome]] and beyond that was Dubrinlar, the western gate into Khôltar. Across Hael Way was [[Manycoins Hall]].",
        "Description": "This luthdren had a dining area that was one very large room with a high ceiling. The stone architecture made it a noisy, echoing place when full of customers.",
        "Services": "A very popular luthdren, Khôltans mainly went here for an evening meal of [[roasted beef|roasted meat]] and soup. [[Rothé]] and [[ox]] carcasses were turned on [[spit]]s over open flames in the dining hall and the meat was trimmed off in full view of the customers. While the meat was served in thick slabs, the [[soup]]s tended to be thin, like [[broth]]."
