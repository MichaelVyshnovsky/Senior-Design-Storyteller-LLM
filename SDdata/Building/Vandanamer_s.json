Across Galaglavur Street was Krosturs Forge. Next door, to the west, was the Maerador House of Welcome and beyond that was Dubrinlar, the western gate into Khôltar. Across Hael Way was Manycoins Hall.\nThis luthdren had a dining area that was one very large room with a high ceiling. The stone architecture made it a noisy, echoing place when full of customers.\nA very popular luthdren, Khôltans mainly went here for an evening meal of roasted meat and soup. Rothé and ox carcasses were turned on spits over open flames in the dining hall and the meat was trimmed off in full view of the customers. While the meat was served in thick slabs, the soups tended to be thin, like broth."
