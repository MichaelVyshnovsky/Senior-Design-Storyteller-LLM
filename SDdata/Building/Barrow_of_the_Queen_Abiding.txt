The '''Barrow of the Queen Abiding''' was a [[Narfell]]i vault within the [[Rawlinswood]] of the [[Great Dale]] holding the [[Queen Abiding]], a [[demon]] bound by the ancient [[Nar]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|183-184|18}} It was disturbed by [[Fallon]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|174|17}}

==Location==
Per the [[Rotting Man]], the Barrow of the Queen Abiding was connected to the [[Arches of Xenosi]] and to the rest of the catacombs around [[Dun-Tharos]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|170-171|16}}

==Structure==
Close to the Arches of Xenosi, a single flight of stairs was hidden beneath a weedy mound.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|177|18}} These led down to a landing; the landing led through a straight tunnel into a larger chamber with a cylindrical block of almost-black ice in the middle. This was the prison of the [[Queen Abiding]]. This chamber had its walls and ceiling covered in brittle, dark ice veins, while the floor was covered in ice just rough enough to gain purchase.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|179-184|18}}

===Atmosphere===
The landing, tunnel, and the chamber were all unnaturally cold, likely due to the power of the Queen Abiding; the walls were themselves covered in eldritch frost and ice.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|179-184|18}}

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, both the group of [[Fallon]] and [[Araluen]],{{cite book/Lady of Poison|182}}
