Crookspar Parlor was a gambling den located in the Crown, the highest section of Skullport.  The lower floor was open to anyone with coin while the upper floor was divided into private rooms in which high stake games of chance were played.  The establishment was considered neutral turf by Skullports gangs and leaders of the towns gangs often gambled in the private rooms.
