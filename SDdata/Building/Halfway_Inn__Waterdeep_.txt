The '''Halfway Inn''' was a busy inn and a tavern favored by adventurers, mercenaries, pirates, and [[Volothamp Geddarm]] located in [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
'''Halfway Inn''' was a cheaper establishment that catered to a wide array of clients. The building itself appeared to be much bigger on the inside, giving its exterior a misleading first impression. The tavern had a winding hall with numerous smaller tap rooms, dining halls, and guest lodgings. The Halfway Inn was favored by adventurers who either celebrated their recent successes or planned dangerous dives.

==History==
''Circa'' 1490s [[DR]], a [[halfling]] [[thief]] who was tasked with a dangerous mission of recovering [[Laeral Silverhand]]'s stolen [[griffon]] cub from the infamous [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] visited their favorite Halfway Inn to try and find some gossip or rumors on the subject. The thief ran across a talkative sailor who was abducted from [[Baldur's Gate]] but managed to escape, the sailer led the halfling to [[Volothamp Geddarm]] who gladly shared his insights on the  matter, pointing the little thief towards [[Skullport]], where the cub was likely held.
