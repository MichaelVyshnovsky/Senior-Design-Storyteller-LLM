The Halfway Inn was a busy inn and a tavern favored by adventurers, mercenaries, pirates, and Volothamp Geddarm located in Waterdeep.
Halfway Inn was a cheaper establishment that catered to a wide array of clients. The building itself appeared to be much bigger on the inside, giving its exterior a misleading first impression. The tavern had a winding hall with numerous smaller tap rooms, dining halls, and guest lodgings. The Halfway Inn was favored by adventurers who either celebrated their recent successes or planned dangerous dives.
Circa 1490s DR, a halfling thief who was tasked with a dangerous mission of recovering Laeral Silverhands stolen griffon cub from the infamous Xanathars Thieves Guild visited their favorite Halfway Inn to try and find some gossip or rumors on the subject. The thief ran across a talkative sailor who was abducted from Baldurs Gate but managed to escape, the sailer led the halfling to Volothamp Geddarm who gladly shared his insights on the  matter, pointing the little thief towards Skullport, where the cub was likely held.
