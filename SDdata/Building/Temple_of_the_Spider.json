        "mainbody": "The Temple of the Spider was a temple of Lolth found in the Northdark of the Underdark. It was overseen by a fervent devotee of the Spider Queen, Syndrith.\nIt temple was constructed a within large cavern located beneath Rothé Valley on the Sword Coast North, accessible by the tunnels known locally as the Shallows.\nThe cavern housing Temple of the Spider was set behind a wall of rock, with a single entrance marked by fine-quality stonework. The entrance was accessible by small stone bridge flanked on either side by statues of drow priestesses.\nThe temple proper was accessible by a descending second, vaulted bridge that was illuminated with neon indigo luminescence.\nThe temple was simple but elegantly beautiful in its design. Built atop rocky outcropping, its circular platform featured a spider-web design on the ground that radiated outward from a central throne. Eight leg-like appendages extended from the platform, constructed in a style that was distinctly drow in design.\nThe Temple of the Spider was presided over by High Priestess Syndrith, a loyal devotee of Lolth that sought to help the Dark Mother gain much greater power than she ever previously held.\nTwo massive driders constructs watched over High Priestess Syndrith as her guardians. One of these monstrosities possessed the power to bathe Syndrith in a rejuvenating beam of energy, the other released a destructive onslaught on any foe that dared breach the temples hallowed walls.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Syndrith and her Deathweavers undertook a ritual that involved the subjugation of Rothé Valley Village on the surface world. While drow were able to capture some of the human villages, and begin construction of an arcane network that sought to transform errant energy leftover from the Spellplague into a new version of the Weave that could be manipulated by Lolth herself. Fortunately for the folks of the Sword Coast, this scheme came to an end when the Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge ventured into the Northdark and raided the Temple of Lolth. The adventuring party slew Syndrith within her domain and proved saviors to the folk of Rothé Valley."
