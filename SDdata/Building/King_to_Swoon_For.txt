The King to Swoon For was a tavern, festhall, and a club in Waterdeep named after King Azoun Obarskyr IV.
King to Swoon For was known for its entrance to Underdark and connections to the criminal underbelly of Skullport.
Cormyrian crown at some point pursued a legal action against the King to Swoon For tavern. It was forbidden for establishments to be named after any members of the royal family within the borders of Cormyr and, apparently they did not tolerate such naming conventions in other regions.
