'''Molar's Artful Armourer''' and '''Molar's Very Well-Equipped Voyager''' was a single blacksmith shop of [[Skull Crag]] in the [[Storm Horn Mountains]] of [[Cormyr]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
Molar's Artful Armourer and Molar's Very Well-Equipped Voyager were two shops with their doors right next to each other with the Voyager door to the south and the Armourer to the west. Each of the shops had a sign with its name, however, once a customer entered either door they quickly realized that both doors led to a single shop and to a single proprietor, a man named [[Molar]].

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century DR, Molar's was the only shop that traded in armor and weapons in Skull Crag, and was popular among the travelers of the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]]. Molar's prices were high due to the monopoly in the village.
