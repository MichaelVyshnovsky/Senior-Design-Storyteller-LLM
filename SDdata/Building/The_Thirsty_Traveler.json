The taverns kitchens were ran by a singe haggish old woman who did not tolerate anyone invading her domain.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, the Thirsty Traveler was a well-renowned establishment, popular among the travelers of the High Road. During that time, the tavern was visited by a group pf caravan guards who would later become the heroes of Skull Crag."
