        "mainbody": "'''Sailor's Crossing''' was a harborside cobblestone plaza decorated with a fountain at its center, located in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "Location": "The plaza stood on the crossing of several streets at the edge of [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]], a single city block northwest from the [[Low Lantern]] and south of [[Fisher's Warf]]. The street called [[Admiral's Way]] began on the next block to the southwest.\n\nThe plaza smelled of salty sea breeze and spayed water mist from its tiered fountain with several [[copper]] [[coins]] in its waters.",
        "History": "[[File:Sailor's Crossing murder.png|thumb|''An elf murdered in 1477 DR.''|300x300px]]\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, on [[Kythorn 19]], the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. A dead [[elf]] [[minstrel]] wearing a glued-on beard was found dead at the fountain's base. A large [[anchor]] was embedded in the man's chest. The adventurer and detective named [[Tav]] begin the investigation of the murder on [[Kythorn 20]], later returning to the crime scene on [[Kythorn 22]]. By that time, the body had been removed by the [[Flaming Fist]]s and sent to the [[Harborside Hospital]] with only a couple of [[poleaxe]]-armed guards keeping an eye on the site."
