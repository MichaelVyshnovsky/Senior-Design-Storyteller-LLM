        "mainbody": "The Stung Monastery, also known as Stung Temple, was an ancient monastery in the Bashan Do Province of Tu Lung. Notably, it was where the powerful placards of the Edusascar were kept.\nThe Stung Monastery stood in the southern Hills of Quai. No roads or trails connected it to surrounding settlements, though the city of Hachou in the north was the nearest.\nThe monastery was founded by its first abbot, a shukenja turned monk. His real name was lost to history, with only his posthumous title Sky Father recorded, in reference to his keen interest in astronomy.\nIn , this abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the paper and ink from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried them into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the Edusascar.\nIn the centuries after, the monks of Stung kept the Edusascar safe within their walls. Though they were stolen a few times, the thieves always returned them, in order to be rid of their deadly curse.\nEach year on the winter equinox,The source refers to a winter equinox, but this is impossible in the Earth calendar and the Calendar of Harptos. It may be in error and should refer instead to the winter solstice, spring equinox, or autumn equinox. Alternatively, the ambiguous Kara-Turan calendar may include a winter equinox. the monks display the Edusascar from the monastery walls as part of a ceremony to honor the gods of the seasons. At such times, they held the placards up and cast their combined magics, causing colorful beams of light to sweep the sky with an appearance similar to an aurora.\nThe individual cards were used for various important purposes. The most valued was La, with its power to mass heal. The monks of Stung carried it when they joined the armies of Tu Lung in battle, using it to heal and rally the troops.\n* Kalifen Stonefist"
