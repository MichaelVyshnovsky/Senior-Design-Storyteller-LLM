'''Zorsin's Dock''' was a dock in [[Suzail]] in  [[Cormyr]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the lead-up to the [[Council of the Dragon]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, [[Khaladan Mallowfaer]] sent two handies, [[Darlakan]] and [[Emmur]], to Zorsin's Dock, where they would unpack some furniture needed for the council. He later sent [[Halance Tarandar]] to go after them, to make sure they didn't break any. Halance, however, was slain on the way to the dock.
