        "mainbody": "The VeltiEnorethal was a school of elven culture in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe VeltiEnorethal provided education in elven traditions, history, philosophy, religion, and magic. This came with years of study and practice, and so inevitably taught patience as well. In particular, it was dedicated to the path of Labelas Enoreth and was a center of his faith, but it was not a true temple.\nIt catered to the children of the elven houses of Loudwater and to friends of the elven nobles. The staff included sages, priests, and wizards.\nAs recorded in their own histories, two elven houses established the VeltiEnorethal and settled on the site, giving rise to the city of Loudwater.\nIn the , a student of the VeltiEnorethal, Galaer Grasswave, became the Green Regent. This attracted many elves to the VeltiEnorethal during his tenure.\nThe VeltiEnorethal was still in operation by 1372 DR. At the time, the sages, priests, and mages were still trying to ascertain which parts of Glaers nearly completed ritual to repair the citys magical wards had actually been completed after the Night of the Blood Moon in 1369 DR.\n* Galaer Grasswave, the Green Regent of 1368/1369 DR."
