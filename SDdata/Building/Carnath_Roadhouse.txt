The '''Carnath Roadhouse''' was a compound and small supply depot found near the [[Mere of Dead Men]] along the [[High Road]] on the [[Sword Coast]] between [[Waterdeep]] in the south and [[Neverwinter]] in the north.

It was at some point used by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] as a waypoint to transfer stolen goods to a secret location in the Mere.
