The Halls of Audience was located within the great fortress of Sarahin in the Haunted Lands.
Thousands of candles kept this chamber lit during all hours of the day or night. The chamber was decorated with pillars of red porphyry, while the balcony steps were polished marble. Beautiful mosaics and mirrors decorated the walls. Stained glass windows of rich color were set in the ceiling, creating an underwater-like effect when the sun shone through from above.
The scent of jasmine infused the air within the Hall of Audience.
Only those who were granted an audience with the Grandfather of the Everlasting were allowed to enter the Hall of Audience.
The entrance to the hall was guarded by members of the Courageous, hidden holy slayers, and archers.
