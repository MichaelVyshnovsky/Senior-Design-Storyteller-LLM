        "mainbody": "'''Dryad's Dreams''' was the only festhall in [[Mosstone]], owned by [[Hlargrim Sturnshon]], where travelers and locals alike could find entertainment, conversation, or rent a room for the night.",
        "Interior": "Dryad's Dreams' most notable feature was that the entire building, walls, floors, ceiling, and furniture were a single piece of shaped wood. Druidic magic was used to mold the wood into tables, stools, and booths. The only pieces of furniture separate from the structure itself were guest chairs.\n\nDryad's Dreams' guest rooms each had three [[lock]]s and complete sound-proofing for extra privacy. Rooms had several concealed doors, and in case of need, windows could be used to exit the place. All were completely soundless. None of the concealed doors could be opened from outside of the festhall. The taproom housed three living [[oak]]s raising up to the festhall's second floor. The trees formed sort of support pillars for the main room.\n\nThe interior of the festhall was warm and moist year-round. The entire place smelled natural and pleasant, vaguely reminiscent of vegetation, wildflowers, and [[spices]].\n\nThe building's hallways that extended away from the main taproom were cross-curtained with entrances obfuscated by screens.",
        "Atmosphere": "Unlike most other festhalls in the Realms, Dryad's Dreams was not filled with wild revelry and loud music. Instead, it was relaxed, dressed down, and used for calm conversations and companionship.\n\nThere were four main types of customers that frequented the Dreams. The first group was those who sought relaxing sleep and full privacy overnight, a place away from prying eyes where they could change disguises, quiet space to study spells or pray to their deities, or similar downbeat activities. The second group consisted of individuals in need of privacy to conduct business or negotiate. The third group - those who wanted not to be seen by fellow Mosstonians, such as secret lovers or secret business cabals. And the final group consisted of those in need of frolicking with or without hired companions.",
        "Services": "Many Mosstonians used dryad's Dreams as an inn. The establishment offered room rentals by the hour at any time of the day or night.\n\nSturnshon daughters offered more intimate services to the clients of the festhall, such as [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s favorite - washing and massaging feet of tired travelers and giving relaxing back massages to the tired foresters. Locals also often came to the Sturnshon to have their dislocated fingers and shoulders set by their skilled hands.\n\nDryad's Dreams had a slim but serviceable selection of foods and drinks available to the patrons. Notably, the establishment carried refreshing [[mint wine]], or thick and hardy [[blackroot beer]]. Food-wise, the Dreams served a dish colloquially called the [[egg platter]], a collection of various boiled bird [[egg]]s, rolled in spices and dips. Other local specialty was the \"[[Secret of the Trees]]\", filled with [[garlic]], [[mushroom]]s, and [[walnut]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Staff": "Hlargrim Sturnshon, the festhall's proprietor in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], was a retired forester. He and his nine daughters ran the establishment. Sturnshon women were all equally stunning and, while at work, were dressed in \"dryad gowns.\" The \"dryad\" uniforms were [[dye]]d green leathers, sewn to resemble tree leaves. The ladies served patrons in the taproom, always happy and cheery, blowing flirty kisses to the guests and gently caressing regulars. All nine had lush brown hair and skin the color of [[ivory]].\n\nDuring his visits to the Dreams, Volothamp Geddarm learned the names of several of Sturnshon daughters: [[Braetha Sturnshon]] was the eldest, [[Kalaeria Sturnshon|Kalaeria]], [[Charethra Sturnshon|Charethra]], and [[Hestroone Sturnshon|Hestroone]], the youngest and brattiest of the group."

        "Rumors & Legends": "The living oak trees in the festhall's taproom were rumored to house slumbering [[dryad]]s."
