        "mainbody": "he Dwarfstone, also known as Durns Finger in some ballads, was a standing stone in Maskyrs Eye in the Vast.\nIt stood alone at the southern end of the vale, leaning at a peculiar angle over the rubble wall of a local farm. It was described as like a stern, pointing finger.\nTo most travelers, it simply marked the southern limit of the village of Maskyrs Eye. However, the villagers themselves thought it to be sacred to the dwarves of the Vast, and would not dare disturb it, nor even venture near it. As to what the dwarves knew of it, none had said anything about it, at least within the memory of humans by the late 1350s DR."
