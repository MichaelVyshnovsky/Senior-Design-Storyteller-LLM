The Cats Meow was a brothel in the city of Ordulin, Sembia, operated by the Church of Sharess, that doubled as a temple or shrine to the goddess in the late 14 century DR.
This business was located in the northeastern quarter of Ordulin, just down the street from the Six Candles Inn.Heir Un-Apparent describes The Cats Meow as being situated in the "SE quarter of the city", however, the Six Candles Inn is located in the NE quarter of Ordulin.
In addition to a bevy of scantily clad dancing coin-lasses and coin-lads, The Cats Meow notably had a bar where wine and exotic drinks flowed freely.
This brothel held nightly festivals, beginning at dusk and carrying on until dawn, during which the Sharessan clergy would select a few among the throngs of people to join them for a "private ceremony".
In the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers hailing from Ravens Bluff came to the city of Ordulin in search of a man named Aaron Marryck. At the suggestion of the elderly Octavian Spellstone, the adventurers sought out two of Aarons former lovers, one of them being the High Priestess of The Cats Meow. There they obtained an audience with the priestess in her private offices, who directed them to where they could find Aarons other former lover, the ranger Symone Hawks-Talon.
A young Sharessan acolyte, Phaedra Dreamingeyes, had just arrived in the city and temple by the time of these adventurers arrival.
The High Priestess of the temple was one Daryian Catseyes. A strapping young male Sharessan by the name of Castilian stood guard at the entryway.
