        "mainbody": "A '''Pillar of Martek''' was a crystal structure in the [[Raurin]] which had the power to summon the [[Tomb of Martek]].",
        "Location": "The Pillars of Martek were approximately north, west, and northwest of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. The northern pillar and the western pillar were {{SI|30|miles|k}} from the city, while the northwestern pillar was approximately {{SI|50|miles|k}} away.",
        "Structure": "The Pillars of Martek were constructions each made of three crystal spires rising straight and true from the ground. There were three such structures, each in a different part of the Raurin. Each individual pillar was {{SI|30|feet}} tall, the triad towering over a {{SI|10|foot}} wide hexagonal base of polished black stone. The spires showed no marks from weather or time, and stood at the north, east, and west of the hexagon, matching its points. Each spire carried one of three inscriptions in an ancient language.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|33}}\n\nA secret door was hidden on the northern side of the northern spire, leading down to an altar room {{SI|20|feet}} beneath the hexagon. The room contained a trap on the altar that would sweep the room with a wall of lightning, and a door behind the altar. The door led towards an empty, unused room with an empty sarcophagus in it. Both rooms had secret doors east and west leading to two corridors, one east and one west; those corridors had nothing but traps in them.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation/Map}}",
        "History": "The Citadel of Martek had been hidden for 1000 years, ever since Martek secreted himself away. It could be called by striking the Pillars of Martek, which  once per day would act like a gigantic tuning fork to summon the Citadel. This had happened several times in the last millenium.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}}",
        "Activities": "If struck sharply, the crystal would sound a vibrating tone, like a tuning fork. Just as the sound began to die down, the ringing would rise again, this time from all three spires, causing the Citadel of Martek to phase into existence: it was visible as a 6 miles wide structure with six elegant minaret towers. A teleporting light would descend from the building onto the platform, remaining active for about 10 minutes.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|114}}"
