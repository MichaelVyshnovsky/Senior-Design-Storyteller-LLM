        "Location": "The tower was located in [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Protector's Enclave]], across the bridge southeast of [[Castle Never]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "Structure": "The tower was circular in its form, with a semi-circular outer hallway surrounding a central, columnar chamber. The double doors of the tower's main entrance were situated atop a small square staircase, opening up to the second level of its interior.<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nBeneath the tower itself was a series of cavernous passageways, used primarily for storage.<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The tower had spacious and austere architecture, with grand hallways that were lined with stone columns and inner gates of fine craftsmanship. The walls were decorated with a number of great tapestries and the top floor even featured windows of stained glass. The interior of the tower possessed a certain feeling of refinement and austerity.<ref name=D&D.N\" />"

        "Activities": "While the original resident of the tower was unknown, it had been repurposed as a [[mage]] tower by the malevolent spellcaster [[Rhazzad]]. Transforming it into what came to be known as the \"Plague Tower\", the [[elven]] wizard conducted experiments on the [[plaguechanged]] residents of [[Neverwinter]].<ref name=D&D.N\" />",
        "History": "Sometime during or before the 1470s [[DR]], the mage Rhazzad traveled to the [[Chasm]] found in the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] and encountered several beings he referred to as the \"Masters\". Rhazzad sought to emulate their work and transform himself using the residual energy leftover from the [[Spellplague]] of the century before, and attain power such as they possessed.<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the secrets of Rhazzad's work was uncovered by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], working for the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. In a final desperate move, Rhazzad abducted [[Dorothea Linkletter]] and fled to his tower, drawing the ire of Dorothea's husband [[Josef Linkletter]], the adventurer, and their fellow members of the Neverwinter Guard.<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nWhile [[Sergeant Knox]] held the front entrance of the tower with [[Hawthidon Faalwun]], [[Dell McCourt]], and the Fargo sisters [[Abbey Fargo|Abbey]] and [[Zoey Fargo|Zoey]], Josef raced into the tower in search of his wife. The Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge followed suit and found the couple safe just moments before Rhazzad appeared. The wizard transformed the guardsman into a kind of plaguechanged monstrosity and set him loose against his friend. The two fought a savage battle that collapsed a part of the tower's ground floor, but the hero emerged victorious and subdued the regretful Josef in time to learn about Rhazzad's whereabouts.<ref name=D&D.N\" />\n\nRhazzad retreated to the top floor of the Tower of Solace, in an attempt to complete his [[ritual]] that would \"give him power over the [[Spellplague]].\" While the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was unable to stop Rhazzad's own transformation into an abomination, they did slay the wizard and prevent them from further threatening Neverwinter and its citizens.<ref name=D&D.N\" />"
