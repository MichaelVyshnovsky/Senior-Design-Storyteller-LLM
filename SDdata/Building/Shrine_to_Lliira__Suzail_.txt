'''Shrine of Lliira''' was a small temple dedicated to the worship of [[Lliira]], the Mistress of Revels, located in the city of [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]], the Forest Kingdom.

==Location==
The Shrine to Lliira stood just two city blocks away from the splendorous [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], sandwiched between [[Swordstars Lane]]{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220313034753/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_080910-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Aug â€“ Oct 2004 | accessdate = 13-04-2021| date = 13-04-2021}} and [[Blade Lane]].

==History==
On [[Mirtul 7]] of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the amnesiac swordswoman [[Alias]] visited the Shrine of Lliira and the [[Silent Room]] of [[Deneir]] in attempts to remove her ''[[azure bonds]]'', which she thought to be a mysterious ''[[curse]]''. However, both temples were closed at the time.
