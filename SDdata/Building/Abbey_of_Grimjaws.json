        "History": "In his declining years [[Jonhar Tallmane]], a [[paladin]] and [[knight]] who served under the Impilturan kings [[Nord]] and [[Halanter II]], retired to the Abbey of Grimjaws. There he gave up the [[enchanted]] blade ''[[Ellendrin]]'', a gift bestowed upon him by Helenter II, and declared that ownership would fall to a different paladin of the Abbey each year. Jondar's stipulation was that said paladin had to wield ''Elendrin'' in defense of the Impilturan monarchy. This tradition would continue until the final days of [[Old Impiltur]]."
