        "mainbody": "'''Skin-Deep Tattoos''' was a shop in [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]], [[Skullport]].",
        "Description": "Skin-Deep Tattoos was a dimly lit [[tattoo]] shop owned by [[Dwarnid Inkpeddler]], an aging [[shield dwarf]] with a distinctive appearance and a mysterious past.",
        "Services": "For a fee, Dwarnid offered his services as a tattoo artist, transforming skin into intricate, living works of art. The cost of his tattoos varied depending on the size of the design, typically ranging from 5 to 25 [[gp]] per square inch. The tattooing process was time-consuming and painful, taking approximately one hour per square inch, and even the most rugged individuals found it difficult to endure. Once completed, it took a full [[tenday]] for the tattoo to heal properly, during which time it must be kept clean to avoid infection.\n\nDwarnid possessed the ability to create special tattoos that functioned as one-time use spells, similar to magical scrolls. It was said that he stole this technique from a [[Red Wizard of Thay]], and as a result, jealous Red Wizards have been hunting him ever since.\n\nUsing his specialized magical tattoo needles, this process could be performed either with the cooperation of the spellcaster who would bear the tattoo or with the assistance of a friendly mage whom Dwarnid discreetly hired. Nearly any low to mid level [[wizard]] [[spell]] could be inscribed as a tattoo, with the notable distinction that the magical energies within the tattoo could be used by anyone.\n\nThe process of creating a magical tattoo took one hour, plus an additional hour per level of the spell to be inscribed. The result was a symbolic representation of the spell, typically about one square inch in size per spell level. To avoid detection, these tattoos were often placed in inconspicuous locations on the body, such as the palm of the hand, behind the knee, or among other tattoos. Once inscribed, the tattooed spell could be activated without the need for [[verbal component|verbal]] or [[material component]]s. The user merely touched the tattoo and directed the spell toward its target. Only one magical tattoo could be inscribed on a bearer at a time. Any attempt to create additional magical tattoos on the same person automatically failed.\n\nOnce used, the caster experienced pain and the tattoo lost its magical properties, becoming a smudged, non-magical marking. While the tattoo could be re-tattooed with magical properties by Dwarnid, it could not be reused or removed by conventional meansâ€”only magical spells designed to erase or obliterate [[glyph]]s effectively removed it.\n\nThe cost of receiving a magical tattoo was considerable: 2,000 gp plus an additional 1,500 gp per spell level, along with the cost of any material components that would have been required to cast the original spell. If the tattoo bearer was not a wizard, and Dwarnid was required hire a mage for assistance, the cost of the mage's services was an additional 1,500 gp per spell level.\n\nDwarnid only produced a maximum of ten levels of magical spell tattoos per tenday. This restriction ensured that demand for his unique services remained high, as few in Skullport matched his skill in this arcane craft.",
        "Inhabitants": "Dwarnid ran his business with the help of two apprentices, [[Eskyria]] and [[Thod]], who were also heavily tattooed and moderately pierced. While skilled, their abilities did not yet match the precision and artistry of Dwarnid himself. Most of the common work, including tattoos for [[buccaneer]]s and [[pirate]]s new to Skullport, was carried out by his apprentices. Dwarnid has not yet taught his apprentices the specialized techniques required for magical tattooing."
