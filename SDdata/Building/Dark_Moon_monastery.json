Tempus' followers abandoned their post during the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, to join the [[avatar]] of their god in [[Battledale]].\n\nSome time later, the [[Tempuran]] devotee [[Jasper Banff]] returned to the temple, only to find it had been taken over by the monks of the Dark Moon. He was unfortunately captured and imprisoned within the caves behind the monastery.\n\n[[File:Dark Moon Shrine.png|thumb|right|''The mountaintop shrine to [[Shar]], that featured a statue of the goddess.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Sun Soul monk]] [[Rasaad yn Bashir]] traveled to the monastery after evading numerous assassination attempts made upon him by the Dark Moon. At the entrance of the temple, he encountered his brother [[Gamaz]], who he believed to have been killed many years earlier in [[Athkatla]].\n\nRasaad and his allies broke through the temple and defeated many of the [[Sharran]] monks. Gamaz and his acolytes attacked Rasaad and his group, but were ultimately defeated. Gamaz apologized to his brother for turning away from the [[Way of the Sun Soul]], but took solace that his death was at his brother's hand.",
