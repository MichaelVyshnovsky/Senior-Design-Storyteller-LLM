Endcliff Tower was one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeeps Trollwall, located in the citys North Ward.Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of "torchtower."The sourcebook City System states that all torchtowers with names are "major towns".
This tower stood on Saerdoun Street, directly across from Endcliff Lane and just north of Zun Villa.
Endcliff Tower stood three stories tall. It was directly connected to the eastern Trollwall, right where it ended before Cliffwatch as a gap, a sheer  drop that presented a grand view of the countryside east and south of the city.
Being a torchtower, Endcliff Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.
Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.
Endcliff Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch, who carefully watched over the edge of Cliffwatch for any sign of invasion.
