The Eveningstar Bakery was a bakery found in the village of Eveningstar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The bakery was located along the High Road near the center of Eveningstar right across from the Market Square.
Like many farms in the 1300s DR, the Eveningstar Bakery was adjacent to a small farm. It had sideyard bake-ovens little mortared domes with wooden shutter door.
Eveningstar Bakery was renowned for its superb daily-baked bread and sweet pastries. The bakerys clients included local Evenor folk and traveling merchants.
The bakery was owned by Urda Malo. When she reached advanced and frail years, she hired several assistants from among the local Evenor women. Her "daughters" helped run the business up until Urda became senile and unable to manage the business. While the Evenor women ran the bakery, they also took care of Urda up until her death. After that, they took over the Eveningstar Bakery and as of the late-15 century DR, the children continued Urdas business.
