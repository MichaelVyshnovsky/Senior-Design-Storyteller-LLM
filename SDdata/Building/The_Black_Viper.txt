The '''Black Viper''' was an [[inn]] found in the city of [[Saerloon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

==Activities==
Though less popular than some of Saerloon's more notable inns, the Black Viper's accommodations were good and the pricing was reasonable. The atmosphere was usually quiet as the inn was well-policed by efficient bouncers that even included a few [[wizard]]s.
