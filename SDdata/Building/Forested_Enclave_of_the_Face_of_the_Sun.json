        "Location": "The temple was located in the [[Netherese]] enclave of [[Unity]].",
        "Description": "The main steeple of the Forested Enclave soared to a staggering 17 stories in height, allowing Amaunator's solar disk to be seen for miles in every direction.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[Righteous Potentate]]s within the temple had a fondness for casting ''[[continual light]]'' on their shaved scalps. This practice caused the [[gnoll]]s of the nearby [[Facile Forest]] to make pilgrimages to the \"lightened ones\" and directed their raids elsewhere."
