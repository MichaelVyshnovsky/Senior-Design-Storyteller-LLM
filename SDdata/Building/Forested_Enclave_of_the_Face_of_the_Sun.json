        "mainbody": "he Forested Enclave of the Face of the Sun was the largest temple constructed for Amaunator, the Sun Lord.\nThe temple was located in the Netherese enclave of Unity.\nThe main steeple of the Forested Enclave soared to a staggering 17 stories in height, allowing Amaunators solar disk to be seen for miles in every direction.\nThe Righteous Potentates within the temple had a fondness for casting continual light on their shaved scalps. This practice caused the gnolls of the nearby Facile Forest to make pilgrimages to the \"lightened ones\" and directed their raids elsewhere."
