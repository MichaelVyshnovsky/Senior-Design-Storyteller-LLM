The '''Wardrobe of Jhaladass''' was the name given to a mysterious cellar that was all that remained of a [[mage]]'s tower in [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]].{{Cite polyhedron/103/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Treasure Tour of Turmish|25}}

==Location==
Although buried underground, the chamber's outer wall could still be reached by entering the cellars of certain other, not-well-known buildings, then passing through some crawlspaces and sewers.

==Structure==
What was exposed was a curved wall constructed of an ominous dark stone inscribed with [[rune]]s, but no entrance.

==Defenses==
While the aboveground magics of the tower had failed, the belowground magics remained incredibly potent yet unpredictable. This unknown warding [[item enchantment|enchantment]] would, when so much as touched or targeted with other magic, trigger a random deadly [[spell]] at the would-be intruders outside. Known spells were ''[[cloudkill]]'', ''[[reverse gravity]]'' (hurling people up at the ceiling then down at the ground six times), ''[[Bigby's clenched fist]]'' (attacking one intruder after another), ''[[cone of cold]]'' (engulfing the whole excavated space), ''[[blade barrier]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[death fog]]'', and ''[[meteor swarm]]'' (eight spheres that hurtled in both directions around the wall's circumference and rebounded without losing speed). Attempts to bypass or break through the wall or its wards with ''[[dig]]'', ''[[passwall]]'', or ''[[dispel magic]]'' had the same results, while [[prismatic spray|prismatic]] spells were reflected upon their casters. The defenses continued underneath the chamber, as one determined digger discovered.

==History==
Long dead by the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the mage [[Jhaladass]] once owned a round tower in Alaghôn, but its aboveground parts were later looted and its [[magic]] deteriorated. Finally, it fell down and another building was erected on the site. All that remained as of around [[1360 DR]] was its circular base and well-warded cellar.

Over the years, explorers located the cellar and excavated a ring around it and even beneath it while trying to find a door or break in, perhaps hoping to find treasure inside. None succeeded.
