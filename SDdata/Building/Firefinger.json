        "mainbody": "irefinger was an ancient Chultan signal tower that survived the ages, until at least the late 15 century DR.\nIt was located in the northern jungles of Chult on the eastern side of the River Tiryki.\nThe tower stood 300 feet (91.4 meters) tall. It walls were steep and very difficult to climb by hand. A few crumbling ladders were situated around its exterior, though they were quite precarious.\nDuring the prosperous years of Chultan civilization, Firefinger was used to communication from one settlement to another. Colored flames were lit at night and colored smoke was created during the day.\nThe blue fires of the Spellplague destroyed many towers similar to Firefinger during the late 14 century. \nAs of the year of the death curse, giant spiders and stirges took over the towers lower floors,"
