        "mainbody": "'''The Tarnished Trumpet''' was a tavern that faced the Mayor's Tower in [[Hill's Edge]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the 1360s [[DR]]. It was alleged to be the best drinking location in Hill's Edge.\n\nIt was a noisy, raucous tavern with tapestries and battered weapons on the walls. Each table in the tavern had old treasure maps magically embedded in glass planes in the tables. Copies were available for sale."
