        "mainbody": "The Temple of Time was a temple to Amaunator founded in the ancient Netherese city of Trinity.\nThe clergy of the Temple of Time had a much more relaxed and non-hierarchical set of doctrines compared to other sects in Netheril. Trinity had been founded by the remnants of three different Amaunatori groups, and in abandoning their theological differences they created a new and unified sect that cared little for the elaborate legalism and bureaucratic systems that were traditional among Amaunatoris.\nThe temple was built in  after lengthy construction efforts. The onset of the Shadowed Age in  brought with it omens of doom that invaded the dreams of the resident potentates, giving them visions of fires, storms, and darknesss. As the end of Netheril approached, the dreams spread to the wider population of the city, but they refused to leave.\nThe temple started shining with bright reflected light during the day in , creating a beacon that was visible for miles away, blinding passersby but also reinforcing the glory of Amaunator. This divine glow abruptly ended 100 years later during Karsuss Folly, while at the same time the sun was blocked by an eclipse, the sky filled with storms, and darkness fell upon the land. Within the next few hours the temple and Trinity had been abandoned as the population sought shelter to the south."
