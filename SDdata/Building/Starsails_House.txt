The Starsails House was the Seafarers Guilds hall in the city of Suzail, Cormyr.
The Starsails House stood on the southern side of the Silverscales Street. It could be found across from the Black Rat tavern, but a couple of doors east, with its entrance facing north, onto Silverscales Street.
The guildhouse organized and serviced sailors, marine captains, fleet owners, navigators, mapmakers, "ropers," sail-makers, shipwrights, and ship repairers of Cormyr and the capital of Suzail.
In the late 14 century DR, Orthan Staramuranter was the no-nonsense man in charge of the guildhall.
