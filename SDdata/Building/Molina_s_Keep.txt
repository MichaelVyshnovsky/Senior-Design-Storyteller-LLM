'''Molina's Keep''' was a ruined fort located in the [[Valley of Khedrun]], that once belonged to the retired adventurers [[Molina]] and [[Kengrin]].

==Location==
The keep was located in the Valley of Khedrun, on the south side of the [[River Mirar]], ninety miles upstream from [[Mirabar]]. It was right on the edge of the northern border of the [[Lurkwood]].{{Cite dungeon/43/Into The Silver Realm|54}}

==Structure==
While it still stood, Molina's Keep was a shell keep consisting of a stone wall, supported by wood and masonry, surrounding a courtyard. In the centre of the courtyard was Molina & Kengrin's home. After it was destroyed, all that was left was a pile of charred rubble.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/43/Into The Silver Realm|58}}

==History==
The sorceress [[Molina]] and her husband, the warrior [[Kengrin]], settled in this keep shortly after the turn of the 14th century [[Marking the years|DR]] following a successful adventuring career. The pair had brought back with them from the [[astral plane]] a [[githyanki silver sword]] named ''Diamond-edge''. A detachment of the [[Mindspear Battalion]] of [[githyanki]] were tasked with retrieving the blade and punishing it's thieves. The gith quickly located the sword and set about establishing a lair in the nearby [[Cinderspire]] volcano. Once they had established their staging point, their [[red dragon]] ally [[Storm (dragon)|Storm]] attacked a village near the keep in the mid-1360s DR, while the githyanki themselves snuck into the keep itself, murdered Kengrin, and ''[[feeblemind]]ed'' Molina.
