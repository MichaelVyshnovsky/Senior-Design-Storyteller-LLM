Molinas Keep was a ruined fort located in the Valley of Khedrun, that once belonged to the retired adventurers Molina and Kengrin.
The keep was located in the Valley of Khedrun, on the south side of the River Mirar, ninety miles upstream from Mirabar. It was right on the edge of the northern border of the Lurkwood.
While it still stood, Molinas Keep was a shell keep consisting of a stone wall, supported by wood and masonry, surrounding a courtyard. In the centre of the courtyard was Molina & Kengrins home. After it was destroyed, all that was left was a pile of charred rubble.
The sorceress Molina and her husband, the warrior Kengrin, settled in this keep shortly after the turn of the 14th century DR following a successful adventuring career. The pair had brought back with them from the astral plane a githyanki silver sword named Diamond-edge. A detachment of the Mindspear Battalion of githyanki were tasked with retrieving the blade and punishing its thieves. The gith quickly located the sword and set about establishing a lair in the nearby Cinderspire volcano. Once they had established their staging point, their red dragon ally Storm attacked a village near the keep in the mid-1360s DR, while the githyanki themselves snuck into the keep itself, murdered Kengrin, and feebleminded Molina.
