The '''Purple Lady''' was a [[festhall]] famed for its "elegant sensuality,"

==Location==
The Purple Lady was found in the southwest section of the city at the end of [[South Ssemm Spur]].

==Structure==
The Purple Lady was a wooden four-story building painted with [[whitewash]] and topped with a steeped shingled roof. Its two top floors cantilever out, looming above the lower floors, the fourth floor looming over the third. They ended in ornate balconies decorated with planters of aromatic flowering plants and the workers' drying undergarments. The building was extended via two cellar levels mostly used for storage and a makeshift "dungeon" for disorderly customers and those who preferred pain in their intimate services.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211226195556/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_070809-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Interior==
The Purple Lady's main entrance was a large ornate double door with a [[brass]]-barrel handle. The door was painted with magic glowing [[paint]]s depicting a woman, [[cloak]]ed and cowled in purple and facing to the right. The second entrance opened into an alleyway and could only be opened from the inside.

Purple banners shrouded the interior, and the staff wore see-through purple [[robe]]s. The main hall was covered in thick carpets and hanging tapestries that hid four armed guards each. The entirety of the main room of the festhall was treated with ''[[firequench]]'' [[spell]]s that stopped anything from igniting or burning in its bounds, and the room was illuminated via round [[glass]] ceiling portholes that let the light from [[lamp]]s of the upper floors in. The main floor was connected to floors above by winding stairwells punctuated by signal [[gong]]s. Past the main hall stood a dimly lit dining hall called The Lady's Pleasure, and past it, the establishment's large kitchen and many pantries.

Facing the main hall, entering through the main doors, guests could part a tapestry to the left and walks the stairs up to enter The Rest. Hosts waited for the guests' requests, and those interested in companionship could request the company of one of the twelve employees. Some guests just needed a room for themselves – to rest or conduct business behind magically protected and soundproof doors.

The Purple Lady's top floor was reserved for the staff. The roofs over the living quarters held only rainwater cisterns. The third floor's rooms were a collection of rental bedchambers. It also included three "pleasure chambers" decorated with fanciful furniture and equipped for any nighttime proclivity. Ten more "pleasure chambers" could be found on the second floor, but they lacked the posh luster of the floor above. The second floor also had two large private meeting rooms with their own kitchen antechamber and a [[dumbwaiter]] descending to the first floor's main kitchen area. A big [[bathing]] chamber was located on the second floor as well as the management's office.

==The Lady's Pleasure==
The eatery on the first floor, The Lady's Pleasure, was a large carpeted room with tile floors turned into a labyrinth of tables, booths, vine-covered zig-zagging folding screens, and potted trees that served as privacy boundaries. All furniture was just as dark as the dining room – all thick and solid wood. Another notable decoration of the dining hall was a collection of [[copper]] chutes and vessels that hung from copper dangle-[[chimes]] with water constantly trickling through them, pumped by hired pedalers, paid three [[cp]] a night, and a large [[watermill]]-like well that moved water from the basement up. The trickling water served as another way of providing guests privacy, drowning out surrounding chatter.

The eatery catered to wealthy couples and those who sought privacy. Trysts were allowed as long as it was done in privacy and discretion. The dining hall had a sophistication about it, and dishes of copper and wood were accompanied by [[brass]] cutlery, [[tankard]]s made of [[silver]], and crystal tallglasses. The Lady's tables were covered in fineweave [[linen]]s of deep crimson.

===Cuisine===
Folk of Westgate considered the establishment's food to be fine in quality and sophisticated. The eatery's menu consisted mostly of generous servings of fowl, smoked [[fish]], and [[boar]] or [[beef]] roasts. Meats were diced and served in rich fatty [[cream]] sauces. Side dishes included [[long beans]] and diced mix of [[apple]]s and [[potato]]es, all fried in flavored [[oil]]s.

Dinners were accompanied by a cornucopia of [[wine]]s poured by wandering servers. The meal-end treat often was a fresh fruit [[salad]] topped with various melted [[chocolate]] sauces, served in [[silver]] [[goblet]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Apart from live-in hosts and companions, the kitchen staff consisted of three cooks and five "runners and dicers." The kitchen staff worked in two shifts–from dusk to midnight and midnight until dawn.

==History==
The original owner of the Purple Lady was [[Anhala Dreith]], who saved enough [[coin]] by cleaning wealthy houses and saving every copper. She was a smart woman who knew that the way to make money in Westgate was through selling alcohol and a midnight company. With time, Anhala became known as a hard-working proprietor who treated her girls well and paid them fairly. Anhala died about a decade before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], but not before making her festhall a local staple and landmark. Anhala's first two hired cooks were [[Onstable Tarth]] and [[Ilimar Jathakh]], who retired scam artists into cooking. Both were dead of old age, like their boss, by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Onstable and Ilimar were responsible for the festhall's name and the purple robe gimmick that proved to be iconic.

The Purple Lady was co-owned by the eatery's chief cook [[Undral Lauram|Undral "Boar" Lauram]], who was a well-liked owner and a friend to the staff, and fearless [[Ambra Indreth]], the senior "Lady of the House." Ambra once made a living by being a chambermaid to a member of the [[Cormaeril]] family, and she transitioned to the festhall work and, later, to a co-owner role.

During the late 14{{th}} century DR, Boar's kitchen staff included women named [[Reldra]] and [[Immra]], and men–[[Orlarrin]] and [[Jelst]]. Wait staff consisted of stoic ex-bodyguards, including "[[Red]]," [[Lorgel]], [[Juth]] and [[Morryk]]. Hostesses were: [[Jemlarra]] from [[Nimbral]] and [[Dautha]] of Westgate. The festhall's senior doorlar was [[Jharak]], and the junior doorlar was young and handsome [[Vreldur]] of [[Sembia]]. The sixteen "Ladies of the House" were all [[human]] with only one [[half-elf]]. They were a varied bunch of people of all colors, shapes, and sizes. Some notable Ladies included [[Nathelle]]–the most popular and beautiful of the group, [[Lalurra]], a woman of piercings, muscles, and [[tattoo]]s, [[Narauntha]] and her sharp tongue, and [[Sharmra]] who appeared as a lady of high class and sophistication. Lastly, [[Maleira]] and [[Harbrenla]], known as the Twins.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the ownership was in the hands of Ilira Nathalan.
