        "mainbody": "The '''Auret''' was the headquarters of the [[Guild Arcane]] in [[Calimport]]<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 /> and commonly considered one of the most impressive sights to behold in that city.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />",
        "Location": "The Auret was located in [[Calimport/Wizard Ward#Najja Sabban|Ziana Drudach of Najja Sabban]] within [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]]. It was the major landmark of its ''[[sabban]]''; in fact, Najja Sabban was colloquially called \"the Auret Sabban\" by citizens of Calimport.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />",
        "Structure": "The building was an immense minaret standing seven stories tall, with a diameter of more than {{SI|75|feet|long=yes}} at its base.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 /> Unlike the Guild Arcane's [[Minargent]]s in other cities in [[Calimshan]], it appeared to be constructed of solid [[gold]] instead of [[silver]].<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 /><ref group=\"note\" name=\"gold\">''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' states that the tower was only \"gold-topped\" and otherwise was silver like other [[Minargent]]s. However, [[Calimport (sourcebook)|''Calimport'']] corrects this, claiming that the entire structure was gold.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"etymology\">The name \"Auret\" is a [[wikipedia:Portmanteau|portmanteau]] of the English words \"aureate\" (\"golden\") and \"minaret\". It is strange that the word would be a play on English words and not [[Alzhedo]] ones, but \"aureate\" is from the Latin word for gold ''aurum'', and Latin may have been the inspiration for the [[Jhaamdathan language]], one of the precursors of [[Common]], which is typically represented by English in Forgotten Realms sourcebooks. Alzhedo itself was another precursor of Common. Thus, perhaps \"aur\" is a [[wikipedia:Phone (phonetics)|phoneme]] of either Alzhedo or Jhaamdathan for \"gold\". Its walls were enchanted with a unique magical illusion; sigils continuously drew themselves onto the wall of the tower, as if being etched onto a molten surface.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />\n\nThe arcane tower had no visible doors. Instead, when members of the Guild Arcane approached from either the ground or the air—Guild members wore magical rings that granted them the power of [[Fly|flight]]—an opening would form in the golden walls allowing them to enter.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />",
        "Services": "Besides serving as the base of operations for the Guild Arcane, the spire contained the '''High One's Library'''. This library was the only library in Calimport that exclusively contained tomes of arcane knowledge—no books on any other topics.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />",
        "Defenses": "Only senior members of the Guild Arcane were allowed access to the library,<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 /> and the library was warded such that it was impossible for any of the books—or even any sort of copies of the books—to leave the library's rooms.",
        "Inhabitants": "The leader of the Guild Arcane in Calimport was [[Sultan]] [[Eli el Beza|Eli yn Adnan el Beza]],<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 /> who was also the ruler of the entire city ward in which the Auret stood.<ref name=Calimport-pp58-59 />",
        "History": "The Auret was destroyed in a fire in the {{YearlinkName|1092}}, after an event known as [[Akham's Duel]], when two powerful mages, [[Akham el Qaandan]] and [[Haneq el Fustaf]] battled over who should be the next [[Caleph Arcane]]. It was later rebuilt.<ref name=Calimport-p23>"
