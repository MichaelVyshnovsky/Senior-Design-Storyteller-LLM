'''Winter Winds''' was a quality clothing shop found in the city of [[Yartar]]. It was run by a pair of brothers, [[Felassal]] and [[Thuorn]], who originated from the great metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]].

===Atmosphere===
The owners were quite welcoming to returning customers, despite the argumentative attitude they took towards one another.

==Services==
The shop offered fashionable clothes, with styles in stark contrast to the rugged lifestyle typically associated with [[the North]]. While their garments were voguish, the brothers' prices were quite steep, typically 5 [[gp]] higher than other shops.
