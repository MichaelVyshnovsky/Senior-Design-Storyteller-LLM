The Inlet was a well-appointed inn in Thentia. It particularly attracted merchants and scholars who wanted a quiet place to relax.
The Inlet sat on a main intersection in southern Thentia, towards the docks.
The interior was heavily decorated with drapes, carpets and tapestries that muffled sound.
The Inlet provided food, drink, and accommodations, with all three combined for the evening for the price of 10 gp. If a guest was overly unruly and disruptive, the proprietor Thud would take them outside, lecture them on manners, and then beat them senseless.
