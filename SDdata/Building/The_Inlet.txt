'''The Inlet''' was a well-appointed inn in [[Thentia]]. It particularly attracted merchants and scholars who wanted a quiet place to relax.

==Location==
The Inlet sat on a main intersection in southern Thentia, towards the docks.

==Interior==
The interior was heavily decorated with drapes, carpets and tapestries that muffled sound.

==Services==
The Inlet provided food, drink, and accommodations, with all three combined for the evening for the price of 10 [[gp]]. If a guest was overly unruly and disruptive, the proprietor [[Thud]] would take them outside, lecture them on manners, and then beat them senseless.
