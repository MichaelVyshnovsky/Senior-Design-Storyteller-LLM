The Watchful Eye was the only inn in Hluthvar around 1368 DR.
The building had a roof, shutters, and not much else.
The rooms were plain and the beds were very hard.
The Watchful Eye of Hluthvar was a dour place that was at least quiet, almost unnerving, like Volothamp Geddarm stated in Volos Guide to the Sword Coast, "calm before a vicious storm".
The inn served served simple food and diluted beer.
