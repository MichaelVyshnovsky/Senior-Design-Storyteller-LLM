The '''Monini Crypts''' was a mausoleum in which the [[Monini]] family of [[Neverwinter]] were interred.

==Location==
The Crypt was located in the [[Craftsman's Rest]] area of Neverwinter's [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]. Following the great upheavals of the land during the [[Ruining]], access to the Crypts was difficult and required finding and traversing a tunnel through the cliffs.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] entered the Monini Crypts in search of the knowledge to gain access to [[Azharzel]], a [[blue dragon]] sealed within the [[Waterclock Guild's Crypts]] long before by [[Romani Monini]]. At that same time, Romani's descendant, [[Zami Monini]], entered the crypt alongside scholar [[Tristopher Chettlebell]] to learn more about her family history. The pair were attacked by the Cultists, who captured Zami and locked her in a [[sarcophagus]]. Meanwhile, Tristopher escaped and, confused about the cultists' motivations after no ransom demands were made, sought help from an [[adventurer]] to rescue Zami.
