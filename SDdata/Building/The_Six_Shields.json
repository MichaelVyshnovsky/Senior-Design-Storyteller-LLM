        "Location": "It was located east, also downwind, of [[Lhuin's tannery]] within the town. Most of the tenants would spend evenings on the porch; this was rather ironic given the malodorous scents wafting down from the tannery.",
        "Cost": "A bed for a night cost 1 [[cp]], or 6 [[sp]] for a tenday; the latter included use of the stables and two daily meals of milk, cheese, and hard bread."
