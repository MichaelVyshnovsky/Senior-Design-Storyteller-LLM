        "mainbody": "he Six Shields was a rough and dirty rooming house located in Ashabenford in the late 1300s DR. It provided housing and food for the field hands, drovers, or other laborers of Mistledale, but did not discriminate against those who simply could not afford the Ashabenford Arms or White Hart Inn. \nIt was located east, also downwind, of Lhuins tannery within the town. Most of the tenants would spend evenings on the porch this was rather ironic given the malodorous scents wafting down from the tannery.\nA bed for a night cost 1 cp, or 6 sp for a tenday the latter included use of the stables and two daily meals of milk, cheese, and hard bread."
