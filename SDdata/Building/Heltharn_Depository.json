        "mainbody": "The '''Heltharn Depository''' was a vault in [[New Sarshell]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Construction": "The structure was three stories tall, bristling with defensive stonework. There were letters carved atop the lintel, announcing it was named \"Heltharn Depository\". The building faced a street.",
        "Services": "Heltharn Depository held on to coin for a fee.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1396}}, [[Seren Juramot]] had been using the depository to store the money she sought to use to buy her freedom from [[Thay]] after the loss of her enclave's funds in [[Raven's Bluff]] during the [[Spellplague]]. That year, however, after [[Xxiphu]] rose from the depths, Seren found the ogres that usually kept watch at the front door missing; she inquired with other customers, and learned they claimed to have appointed [[Morgenthel]] as its new Master of Coins.",
        "Defenses": "Besides the defensive stonework, two ogres generally guarded the entrance. Inside, a number of protective wards and charms were active."
