        "mainbody": "The '''Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility''' was a facility that destroyed and recycled garbage in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite polyhedron/52/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility|22}} It was established sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] under decree by Mayor [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]], replacing a junkyard.",
        "Location": "This facility sat on the east side of [[Zeldazar Street]], in the [[Pumpside]] neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside District]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "Structure": "[[File:RBSanitationFacility.png|thumb|273px|''A map of the Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility.'']]\nThe Sanitation Facility was surrounded by a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} high stone fence, covered in climbing flowers and [[ivy]]. It had single gate, pair of [[iron]]-reinforced wooden doors. A sign written in common hung over the gates that read \"Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility\" in [[Common]], followed beneath by the words, \"We pay for your TRASH\".\n\nInfront of the gate stood a gate house. Northwest of it stood a small residential building. And in the central back of the facility was the \"Storage Facility,\"{{Cite polyhedron/52/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility|25}}\n\nSeveral small [[incense]] burners could be found lit around the corners of the facility, elliminating foul odors from its trash and warding of various vermin that had a tendency to visit the dump. Two small water towers also stood within the facility, used to put out the infrequent fires that occurred from stockpiles of flammable garbage like [[paper]] and the foul odors that such fires produced.",
        "Services": {
            "Waste Disposal": "All trash that was not sold by the end of a week was disposed of by placing it upon a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]''. This ''sphere'' was kept secured within a vault made of cement and stone, with thick [[lead]] panels bolted onto its interior walls, and an iron door that was {{SI|2|in|long=yes}} thick. There was only one [[key (item)|key]] to the vault, kept in the hands of the facility's resident [[wizard]], and if anyone other than that wizard tried to move the ''sphere'' a ''[[magic mouth]]'' would activate, shouting the message, \"Alert the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]]. Someone is trying to steal the ''sphere''!\". As an extra precaution, the room that the vault was kept within had a ''[[glyph of warding]]'', mimicking the effects of ''[[flame strike]]'', that was cast by a powerful [[priest]] on the floor between the entrance and the vault.\n\nOriginally, the existence of the ''sphere of annihilation'' was known by only the facility's chief staff and the city's mayor, with the wider public believing excess trash was simply dumped into a dry well."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "The facility was chiefly operated by [[John Porter]], its sole foreman, and its resident wizard [[Marian Wicksal]], who provided its ''sphere of annihilation'' from among the trove of [[magic item]]s she had gained back when she was an [[adventurer]]. She lived at the dump alongside her pet [[pseudodragon]], [[Rouge]], and had weekly first picks of any spell components.\n\nDuring daylight hours Porter was usually stood inside the gatehouse, drinking [[coffee]]. He oversaw a dozen untrained [[human]] laborers who had escaped from [[slavery]] somewhere across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nVarious small vermin had frequented the dump, including [[gull]]s, [[rat]]s, [[raven]]s, and [[squirrel]]s. These were often warded off by the incense that was lit around the facility, though larger animals like rogue [[bear]]s were not put off. Occasionally outside help was hired to chase away larger animals or to hunt them down."
