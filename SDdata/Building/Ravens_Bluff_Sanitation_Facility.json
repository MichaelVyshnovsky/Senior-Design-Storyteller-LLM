        "mainbody": "The Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility was a facility that destroyed and recycled garbage in the city of Ravens Bluff. It was established sometime in the 14 century DR under decree by Mayor Charles Oliver OKane, replacing a junkyard.\nThis facility sat on the east side of Zeldazar Street, in the Pumpside neighborhood of Ravens Bluffs Southside District.\nthumb|273px|A map of the Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility.\nThe Sanitation Facility was surrounded by a  high stone fence, covered in climbing flowers and ivy. It had single gate, pair of iron-reinforced wooden doors. A sign written in common hung over the gates that read \"Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility\" in Common, followed beneath by the words, \"We pay for your TRASH\".\nInfront of the gate stood a gate house. Northwest of it stood a small residential building. And in the central back of the facility was the \"Storage Facility,\"\nSeveral small incense burners could be found lit around the corners of the facility, elliminating foul odors from its trash and warding of various vermin that had a tendency to visit the dump. Two small water towers also stood within the facility, used to put out the infrequent fires that occurred from stockpiles of flammable garbage like paper and the foul odors that such fires produced.\nBy law the citizens of Ravens Bluff had to collect and dispose of their waste at this facility, but to encourage the populace to follow the law the city paid one copper piece per  of trash brought in. Tanneries and other businesses that produced hazardous garbaged were given a higher reward of three copper pieces per  of trash they disposed of properly.\nAll trash was weighed upon a large, plain-looking iron scale that stood next to the gatehouse. It stood  tall, measured  wide, and weighed . Sometimes people tried to cheat the scales by \"loading\" their trash with rocks or weights, thus the facilitys workers made sure to check all trash during the weighing process. Anyone caught trying to cheat the scales would be fined an amount of copper pieces that was equal to the loaded weight of their trash multiplied by 10.\nThe citys reward for trash disposal encouraged a lot of participation from vagrants and adventurers who were down-on-their luck. The trash was also delivered to the dump by a group of roguish street cleaners employed by the city. Once in the hands of the facility garbage was seperated into glass, metal, paper, wood, decomposing food, weeds, spell components, and anything else that could be melted down or sold. There existed an unofficial rule amongst the facilitys workers that anything valuable could be kept by the worker who found it.\nOnce per week the stockpiled trash was put up for sale to Ravenians and people from the surrounding countryside, with the exception of dangerous materials like acids and poisons. or feed. All wood scraps were carted off to the citys harbor and the neighborhood of Torchtown.\nAll trash that was not sold by the end of a week was disposed of by placing it upon a sphere of annihilation. This sphere was kept secured within a vault made of cement and stone, with thick lead panels bolted onto its interior walls, and an iron door that was  thick. There was only one key to the vault, kept in the hands of the facilitys resident wizard, and if anyone other than that wizard tried to move the sphere a magic mouth would activate, shouting the message, \"Alert the City Watch. Someone is trying to steal the sphere!\". As an extra precaution, the room that the vault was kept within had a glyph of warding, mimicking the effects of flame strike, that was cast by a powerful priest on the floor between the entrance and the vault.\nOriginally, the existence of the sphere of annihilation was known by only the facilitys chief staff and the citys mayor, with the wider public believing excess trash was simply dumped into a dry well.\nThe facility was chiefly operated by John Porter, its sole foreman, and its resident wizard Marian Wicksal, who provided its sphere of annihilation from among the trove of magic items she had gained back when she was an adventurer. She lived at the dump alongside her pet pseudodragon, Rouge, and had weekly first picks of any spell components.\nDuring daylight hours Porter was usually stood inside the gatehouse, drinking coffee. He oversaw a dozen untrained human laborers who had escaped from slavery somewhere across the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nVarious small vermin had frequented the dump, including gulls, rats, ravens, and squirrels. These were often warded off by the incense that was lit around the facility, though larger animals like rogue bears were not put off. Occasionally outside help was hired to chase away larger animals or to hunt them down."
