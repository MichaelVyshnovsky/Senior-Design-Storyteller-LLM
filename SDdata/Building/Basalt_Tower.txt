The Basalt Tower was a colossal stone tower located on the plane of Avernus in the Nine Hells.
Leading up to the Basalt Tower was a damaged stone bridge that connected it to a rocky outcropping. That hellish platform held a portal that connected to the Prime Material plane, more specifically, the basement of Dragonspear Castle on Toril.
The towers peak was accessible by means of a iron-lattice elevator that was suspended by four enormous chains.
For some time at least, the entrance to the tower was guarded by the devil known as Thrix the Profane.
In the , the Hero of Baldurs Gate descended into Avernus and arrived at the Basalt Tower while in pursuit of Caelar Argent. The baatezu Belhifet made his final stand against the aasimar paladin and the Bhaalspawn at the top of the tower.
