        "mainbody": "Hindror House was a residence in Khôltar, south Faerûn, that had been repurposed as rented workshop and office space, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis building was located near the Dubrinlar gate (the western gate through the walls of Khôltar) on the northwest side of Orntathtar Way. It sat between Nolvurs Manyworks and Halamors Tower. On the other side of Halamors Tower was Darrusktraal, the duty-house for Dubrinlar.\nHindror House was a small tower (or \"fist\" in the local vernacular) that was not as big or as ornately decorated as Halamors Tower.\nRooms in this building were rented out to various individuals, guilds, or businesses that did finecrafter work&mdashfinishing, assembling, and polishing small items like hasps, doorknockers, and padlocks.\nHindror House was built as a residence, but when Halamor made a lucrative business out of renting his residence to finecrafters, his neighbors did the same."
