        "mainbody": "he Golden Ruins were a series of ruins in the Eastern Plains of Cormyr.\nThey lay hidden in a valley situated some 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the Hullack Trail, and the same distance from the village of Ghars.\nThey were named for the yellow stone they were built from, much to the disappointment of would-be treasure hunters who sometimes visited here. Local folk stayed away, citing weird sounds and indistinct shapes glimpsed moving through buildings thick with brush."
