        "mainbody": "he Singing Dryad was a tavern and dining hall located in the village of Snowmantle during the 14 century DR. It was one of the few businesses that survived the occupation of the settlement by Zhentarim forces in the year 1355 DR.\nThe original owner of the Dryad, Juliana Saans father, was killed when the Zhents took over Snowmantle. The leader of the Zhentarim, a wizard by the name of Ragnoth, transformed the establishment into a messhall for the Zhentilar troops under the command of Grimbones the Bold, to which Julianna reluctantly acquiesced. She was particularly careful not to wrong the Zhents, in order to preserve the legacy of her father.\nIn the year 1369 DR, the Dryad was frequented by a gang of Zhentilar recruiters led by the half-orc Gruel."
