        "mainbody": "'''Black Stars Logging''' was a collectively owned lumber mill in the town of [[Velarsburg]], [[Harrowdale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Ownership was shared among all of the woodcutters who were not part of the [[Torsyld]] family.\n\nThey worked with furniture makers within the town, who would display their fine work within their showcased products. These finely crafted items were quite popular in the [[Dragon Reach]].\n\nAs was the practice in Velarsburg, each logger that worked out of the Black Stars yard learned how to specifically harvest, cut, and season only one, or at most a few, types of wood. They would then brand their wood with the company's logo, an arch of three black stars."
