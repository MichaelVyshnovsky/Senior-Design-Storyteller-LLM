        "mainbody": "'Summit Hall''' was a base and training monastery for the [[Knights of Samular]], an order dedicated to [[Tyr]], god of justice. It was founded byÂ [[Samular Caradoon]] in the {{YearlinkName|952}}.",
        "Geography": "It was located on a hilltop of the [[Sumber Hills]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], within the greater region of [[the North]].",
        "Layout": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Summit hall consisted of a stone hall surrounded by a fifteen-foot wall with a sturdy wooden gate. Contained within the walls were stables, a tower, barracks, and storage buildings.",
        "Activities": "Originally the tower was occupied by [[Renwick Caradoon]], and contained his phylactery. Upon Samular's orders, the tower was to remain undisturbed for all time, in honor of his brother's memory.\n\nFollowing Samular's  demise, Summit Hall also held the tomb that contained his remains.\n\nAround that same time, Summit Hall was home to around a dozen Knights of Samular, another dozen aspirants-in-training, and about fifteen servants and artisans who helped maintain the place. The occupants of Summit Hall grew their own food and maintained watch over nearby lands. They were always ready for battle, and fully armed and armored if encountered outside their walls."
