'''Lanternlighter's''' was a shop in [[Skullport]] that sold lanterns. Located in [[Dredge|the Dredge]] of the city, the establishment was owned and operated by [[Anderian Dusk]], an elderly [[half-elf]].

==Services==
While lanterns were readily available within the shop, oil was not offered by its proprietor. As the two items went hand-in-hand, any customers seeking lamp oil were referred by Anderian to the [[Overflowing Urn]].

Those who walked into Lanternlighter's were unknowingly spied upon by the [[sea hag]]s that dwelled within [[River Sargauth]]. This was accomplished by means of a magical [[amulet]] that Anderian Dusk wore around his neck, a service for which he was well-paid.
