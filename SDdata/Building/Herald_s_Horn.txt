The '''Herald's Horn''' was an inn and brewery in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-3{{rd}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Herald's Horn was within [[Skuldaskar]], at most one day of travel from [[Skuldask Road]]{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|22|1}} and around a tenday of travel to the southeast of the [[Reaching Woods]].Per [[Karlmuth Hauntokh]], the [[River Reaching]] ran through a forest northeast of the Herald's Horn. Thus, the Herald's Horn is taken to be southwest of the [[Reaching Woods]]. It lay in a small hollow, surrounded by open fields.

==Structure==
The signpost was on the corner of a paddock, reading "Be Welcome at the Herald's Horn". The sign had a [[painting]] of a [[silver]] horn. Several buildings close to it reeked of [[hops]], and the gate had an overhanging [[iron]] horn. Beyond it lay a muddy yard. An iron gong hung close to the entrance.

==Interior==
The atmosphere smelled of [[cedar]], and had at least one [[hearth]] with a chimney. The place had flagstones covered in sawdust, used tree trunks as pillars, and was poorly illuminated. Many planks bore the scorchmarks of old fires, and beetles wandered the floors freely. The smell indicated the whole place was used sometimes as a brewery.

==Services==
The Herald's Horn provided meals and rooms. As of {{yearlink|241}}, the prices were two [[sp]] for a bed, another two for meals, and each tankard of drink was 1 [[cp]]. The ingredients for the meals served inside were strongly implied to include [[radish]] and [[pepper]].

==Defenses==
The perimeter was surrounded by a stockade wall. The owner, [[Drelden]], claimed to throw out anyone who drew steel inside.

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Elminster]] was a patron of the establishment for a night after losing his [[horse]]; the owner, Drelden, claimed at the time to have built the place himself.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|27-33|1}}

Surgath was killed later by [[Heldebran]],{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|35|1}} while that evening, Elminster's room was set upon by four different attackers.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|40|2}}

==Inhabitants==
* [[Drelden]]
* [[Rose (innkeeper)|Rose]]
Additionally, at least one more staff member was present: a young boy.
