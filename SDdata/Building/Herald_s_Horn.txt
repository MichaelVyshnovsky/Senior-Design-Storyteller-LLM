The Heralds Horn was an inn and brewery in the Western Heartlands in the mid-3 century DR.
The Heralds Horn was within Skuldaskar, at most one day of travel from Skuldask Road and around a tenday of travel to the southeast of the Reaching Woods.Per Karlmuth Hauntokh, the River Reaching ran through a forest northeast of the Heralds Horn. Thus, the Heralds Horn is taken to be southwest of the Reaching Woods. It lay in a small hollow, surrounded by open fields.
The signpost was on the corner of a paddock, reading "Be Welcome at the Heralds Horn". The sign had a painting of a silver horn. Several buildings close to it reeked of hops, and the gate had an overhanging iron horn. Beyond it lay a muddy yard. An iron gong hung close to the entrance.
The atmosphere smelled of cedar, and had at least one hearth with a chimney. The place had flagstones covered in sawdust, used tree trunks as pillars, and was poorly illuminated. Many planks bore the scorchmarks of old fires, and beetles wandered the floors freely. The smell indicated the whole place was used sometimes as a brewery.
The Heralds Horn provided meals and rooms. As of , the prices were two sp for a bed, another two for meals, and each tankard of drink was 1 cp. The ingredients for the meals served inside were strongly implied to include radish and pepper.
The perimeter was surrounded by a stockade wall. The owner, Drelden, claimed to throw out anyone who drew steel inside.
In , Elminster was a patron of the establishment for a night after losing his horse the owner, Drelden, claimed at the time to have built the place himself.
Surgath was killed later by Heldebran, while that evening, Elminsters room was set upon by four different attackers.
