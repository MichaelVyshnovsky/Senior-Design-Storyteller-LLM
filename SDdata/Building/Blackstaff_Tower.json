        "Structure": {
            "Exterior": "Blackstaff Tower's main entrance was on [[Swords Street]]. There was also an apprentice's gate, through which apprentices could gain access by touching the gate with a left palm. The tower was surrounded by a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} wall.\n\n[[File:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower exterior walkway.jpg|thumb|left|''The tower's exterior walkway.'']]\nThe tower appeared to be made out of smooth black stone, with no windows or doors. From the outside, the structure appeared to be a three-story stone tower, but inside, there were at least a dozen more levels, and some of these could only be reached by magical means. Everything connected to the central stairwell, although magical passwords were required to transport to certain areas of this stairwell. The three levels visible from the outside were all freely accessible via simply using the stairs. \n\n[[File:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower2.jpg|thumb|''Fortunately, the tower could repair itself.'']]\nThe tower had the ability to repair itself, along with its outer walls and gates, when damaged, and this process could be helped along by Laeral Silverhand. After an attack in which a wall was demolished, the tower was back to normal the same day.",
            "Interior": "From the inside, windows appeared to show what was going on outside, but these were illusions. The tower was protected against [[scrying]] magic.\n\n[[File:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower stairs.jpg|thumb|''The tower's stairwell.'']]\nRooms were connected to the central stairwell and entry hall, which was full of floating doors and arches. Many alcoves and shelves covered the walls of the stairwell, displaying magical items and artifacts, and although they seemed unprotected, a command word was needed to remove any of them. The items changed on a regular basis, so returning to the same stairwell on another day might result in seeing different items. Leaving the dormitories without issuing a command word would lead to the second level's stairwell. Saying the command word ''nhurlaen'' in the stairwell took one to the study.\nOn the top floor of the tower was a study and a scrying chamber. There was also a parlor where Khelben displayed his art. In the library was one-way dimensional door to [[Candlekeep]] (the other side of the door led to [[Jester's Court]] nearby). As of [[1374 DR]], the tower's entry chamber contained a wardrobe that Khelben was able to use to access almost any closet in the tower. In the tower's kitchen, Khelben liked to serve cups of roasted [[chicory]].\n\n<gallery captionalign=center widths=200px>\nFile:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower side room.jpg|''A side room.''\nFile:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower reading room.jpg|''The tower's reading room.''\nFile:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower1.jpg|''Another room of [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben]].''\nFile:Demon Stone concept Blackstaff Tower apothecary.jpg|''The tower's apothecary.''\n</gallery>\n\nTunnels linked the tower's basement to [[Piergeiron's Palace]] and other locations in Waterdeep, which could be accessed by uttering the command word ''vhuarm''. One such tunnel could be accessed at [[Northspur Rock]] on [[Northspur Landing]] on the [[Talltumble Stairs]] in [[Mountainside]].\n\nIn [[1361 DR]], [[Danilo Thann]] moved the ''[[elfgate]]'' [[portal]] to [[Evermeet]] to Laeral's chambers in order to facilitate more quality time between her and Khelben."

In fact, the tower became so linked to the Blackstaff that, upon the death of their master, the heir must immediately travel to the tower. On at least two occasions, the Blackstaff died outside of the tower and the heir was driven insane until they returned to the tower.\n\nIn [[1415 DR]], the fourth Blackstaff, [[Krehlan Arunsun]], modified Blackstaff Tower using the ''[[kiira N'Vaelhar]]'' to allow templates of the spirits of each former Blackstaff to communicate with anyone in the tower, and with the Blackstaff where he or she was. The templates were a permanent [[illusion]] of the spirit of each Blackstaff; in visible form, the template appeared as the Blackstaff did in life but with a green glow. While in the tower, the Blackstaff was also aware of every person in the tower or within a few feet of the tower.\n\nBeginning in [[1479 DR]],",

The ''elfgate'' to [[Evermeet]] (created by [[Amnestria]] with [[Arilyn's moonblade]]) was located in Laeral's chambers after [[1361 DR]]."
