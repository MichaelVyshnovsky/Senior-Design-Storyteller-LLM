'''Harbourview Park''' was a tiny public park located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Harbourview Park was a small triangular park located at the corner of a city block, across the street from [[Lady Jannath's Estate]] in the Lower City. The park was nothing more than a fenced plot of green land with a path that cut across. The park held several trees and some shrubbery, with two benches on both sides of the passage that ended in arches. A single drinking fountain was built into the side of the building that formed one of the triangle plot's edges.

==History==
The [[patriar]] Jannath family financed and maintained Harbourview Park starting with the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, as a notice board outside proudly announced. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], the park was frequented by [[healer]] [[Sylbert]] and [[Twitch Broven]], commoners of the Lower City.
