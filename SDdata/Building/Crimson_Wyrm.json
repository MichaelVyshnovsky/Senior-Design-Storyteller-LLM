        "mainbody": "The '''Crimson Wyrm''' was an old manor house in the village of [[Volkumburgh]] that was rebuilt and repurposed into an inn.",
        "Structure": "Outside the building was a sign bearing an image of a red winged snake. Underneath it was the word \"Welcome\" written in [[Common]], [[Elvish]], and [[Dwarvish]]. The inn also had a set of stables.",
        "Interior": "The inn had four guest rooms, each containing two single-person beds.",
        "Services": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the inn offered a good meal for 3 [[copper piece]]s, drinks such as [[cider]] for 2 copper pieces, and lodgings for 5 copper pieces. [[Horse]]s were also stabled and fed for 5 copper pieces a day. If a guest provided their own [[bedroll]], they would be allowed to sleep in the common room for a single copper piece.\n\nIn addition to being an inn, the Crimson Wyrm functioned as the town's dry goods store. Selling anything that could be used in day-to-day living, such as a [[block and tackle]]. Weapons were occasionally stocked, but they were expensive.",
        "History": "In the mid-12{{th}} century [[DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} after Volkumburgh Vale was sacked by the rampage of the [[devil]]-possessed [[stone golem]] known as [[Awtawmatawn]], the village's [[Lord Volkumburgh]] hid his treasure beneath what would become the Crimson Wyrm. A narrow passageway connected its concealed cavern to a trapdoor beneath the village's fountain. This treasure was known to the inhabitants of Volkumburgh village, though its location was not, and over time it would come to be known as \"Volki's treasure.\"\n\nIn [[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a man named [[Lychor]] took up lodgings in the inn to keep an eye on [[Amelior Amanitas]]'s efforts to reconstruct the golem and made duplicates of all his notes and plans. His [[imp]] [[familiar]] [[Anabis]] guarded his rented room.\n\nIn the month of [[Calendar of Harptos|Uktar]], some time before the [[Feast of the Moon]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Suzail]] would arrive, seeking out the scattered remains of the fabled Awtawmatawn on behalf of Amelior. When they came to the Crimson Wyrm its proprietor served them a free round of hot cider. They would rent themselves rooms and stay to easedrop on the local gossip.\n\nEventually, those adventurers managed to help Amelior re-assemble Awtawmatawn. And once finally awakened it began to rampage around Volkumburg. With [[magic item]]s provided to them by Amelior, the Suzailian adventurers managed to defeat the golem and it fell upon the Crimson Wyrm. Destroying it and revealing a hidden cave underneath that contained Lord Volkumburgh's fabled treasure. \n\nOver a decade later, the Crimson Wyrm could still be found within the town, having been rebuilt.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the 14{{th}} century DR, the Crimson Wyrm was owned and operated by Volkumburgh's leader, [[Red Rudyard]]."
