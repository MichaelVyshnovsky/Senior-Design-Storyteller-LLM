        "mainbody": "'''Wangle's Livery''' was a stable in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]]. It was managed by [[Wangle Towerstruck]].\n\nThe livery traded in all kinds of livestock, especially [[horse]]s, which could be of top-quality. Mounts could also be stabled for 2 [[gold piece]]s a night. Patrons could expect their mounts to receive good feed, grooming, and a cleaning, as well as veterinary care and [[horseshoe|re-shoeing]] as needed."
