        "mainbody": "angles Livery was a stable in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR. It was managed by Wangle Towerstruck.\nThe livery traded in all kinds of livestock, especially horses, which could be of top-quality. Mounts could also be stabled for 2 gold pieces a night. Patrons could expect their mounts to receive good feed, grooming, and a cleaning, as well as veterinary care and re-shoeing as needed."
