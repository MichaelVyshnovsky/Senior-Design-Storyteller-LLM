==Background==
Citadel Firequench was a massive [[basalt]] citadel west of the [[Achazar|Raging Flame]]'s location, surrounded by the ruins of buildings destroyed by the fires of the Raging Flame.

Citadel Firequench was originally the property of a [[pirate]] baron and the previous city's jail before the Firequench Order was founded.
