        "mainbody": "ilvers Palace was a ruined castle located in Tilverton, the former home of the archwizard Tilvara who lent her name to Tilverton and Tilvers Gap.\nThe castle remained undisturbed and unpillaged despite its long abandonment thanks to extensive and lethal magical defenses. Most prominent of these was what the locals called the Medusa Garden, a forest of petrified people and monsters that would animate and attack any intruders. The light from spells could be seen drifting about and flashing inside the ruins, and there were reports of watchghosts, beholders, and other strange things reported from the few survivors of attempted explorations. The ruin was also impenetrable to all known forms of divination that might be used to discern its secrets, making it a terrifically mysterious and deadly location for intruders.\nThe ruins were located in the southwest section of the city, in the Old Town of Tilverton near the Cormyr Stairs and the Altar of Shields.\nTilvers Palace was once the castle home of the archmage Tilvara, and served as the center of a human and elven trading settlement around it and underground, which later became known as Tilverton. In time, Tilvara died and her castle fell into ruin, though it remained undisturbed by looters."
