        "mainbody": "he Hall of Wonders was a museum in Baldurs Gate that displayed both the pragmatic and fantastical \"holy relics\" of the church of Gond. It was considered a religious site to the Gondar faithful, both to Baldurian followers and those from far away.\nDue to their close proximity and similar names, the Hall of Wonders and nearby High House of Wonders were often mixed up by first-time travelers to Baldurs Gate. As such, locals came to refer to this location as \"the Hall\", while the High House came to be known as \"the Temple\". \nThe hall was constructed from white marble and stood out in stark contrast to the surrounding buildings of the Upper City. Its massive doors bore the holy symbol of Gond, a large many-toothed white cog that slowly turned clockwise without any influence.\nThe Hall was a treasure trove of the grand, mechanical, and technological advancements of which the Gondar church was capable. Each wonder was accompanied by a small sign that described its purpose and function.\nSome of the creations displayed throughout the years included\n* A precision water-clock.\n* The fanchair, which when rocked, allowed a seated individual to be cooled by fans.\n* The pump of Gond, a water-pump powered by the physical effort of a person.\n* One of the first-ever farseers ever crafted.\n* Gondsman Leonardos helical aerial wonder.\n* A gold-filigreed astrolabe that was carved from coral\n* The steam dragon, which was used to convey heavy objects or rather large loads of goods.\n* A steam-powered mechanical orchestra.\n* The mechanical scribe, which was a sort of hand-powered printing press.\nLocated near the main entrance/exit was a shop that sold all manner of Gondar devices. It included such practical daily-use items as locks, strongboxes with hidden compartments, water pumps, and and even steam dragons. If a patron was unable to purchase an item of their choosing then and there, they were given a printed catalog that allowed for future ordering and delivery.\nThere was a hidden area deep beneath the Hall that was rumored to store a vast cache of great wealth and treasure. While its exact contents were unknown, it was accessible though a secret passageway, protected by pressure plates and other unknown machinations. The origin to this \"secret\" area was rumored to be located beneath the grand altar of the nearby High House of Wonders.\nFor a small fee (4 sp during the 14 century and 5 cp in the 15) a visitor or tourist could view the creations of Gond in all their glory. Acolytes of Gond regularly toured the Hall to demonstrate the use of its wonders. Visitors were strictly forbidden from touching any item within."
