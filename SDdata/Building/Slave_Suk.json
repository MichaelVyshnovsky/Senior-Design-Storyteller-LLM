        "mainbody": "he Slave Suk was a large natural cavern that rested at the heart of the Ring Caverns of Oryndoll.\nIt sat at the junction of three of the tubes coming from individual rings, and resembled the sphere in the middle of each ring cavern. It only lacked private housing and an outer ring.\nThe function of the Slave Suk was a slave market. This was where mind flayers gathered in the city to buy future thralls that were either bought or taken from foreign merchants. Word spread fast in the City of Loretakers, and soon after a slave caravan arrived the market would fill up with illithids looking for new thralls. \nIllithid drovers would parade the future thralls in front of the crowd. As soon as all the thralls had passed the eager illithid crowd, the bidding began. The bidding was heavily supervised by an auctioneer, and merchants were allowed to set minimum prices for thralls. Without exceptions, it was illegal to stop the bidding once it began."
