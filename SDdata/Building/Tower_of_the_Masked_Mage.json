        "mainbody": "he Tower of the Masked Mage was a temple to Vhaeraun in Sshamath.\nSshamath was a drow city in an Underdark cavern, with the temple hanging from the caverns roof. It was situated in the Darkwoods district,\nThe city was unique among drow cities in that it wasnt ruled by a clergy but by mages. Vhaeraun, under the alias Masked Mage or Lord of Shadow, was primarily worshiped in his role as the drow patron of shadow magic and spellfilchers. Religion and divine magic werent viewed highly in the city and the same applied to this temples faith. Due to this reason, they didnt have many clerics and the majority were rogues and spellfilchers, as well as arcane caster who used the Shadow Weave. The head priest of this temple was Shadow Sorcerer Pharaun Lhalabar who, despite his title, didnt possess any arcane capabilities.\nThe School of the Shadow Weave was an attempt to get a seat in Sshamaths ruling body.\nDuring the Silence of Lolth, Lolths priesthood lost their powers and Vhaerauns clerics took the official positions formerly held by Lolths clergy. \nWhen Vhaeraun died in the course of the War of the Spider Queen, a minority tried to convert to Eilistraee to follow the remainder of their former deity, but they were killed by those who converted to Shar."
