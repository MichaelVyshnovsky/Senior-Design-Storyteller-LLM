The '''Castle of Shadows''' was the main base of the evil [[malaugrym]] and of their leaders, who held the title of [[Shadowmaster]].

==Location==
The castle was located on the [[Plane of Shadow]].

==Interior==
The castle imparted the ability to [[shapechange]] on all [[human]]s who entered it, although leaving the Plane of Shadow caused this ability to fade. This led to shapechanging effects that began triggering at random, requiring great fortitude to suppress. The phenomenon led some to believe that the [[malaugrym]]'s shapechanging abilities might not be innate, but were instead a result of dwelling within the castle. 

==History==
The castle was built by the [[wizard]] [[Malaug]] sometime prior to his siring of the malaugrym race.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|1}}

During the [[Harpstar Wars]] ([[1182 DR|1182]]â€“[[1222 DR]]), the malaugrym of the Castle of Shadows fought against the [[Harpers]] as well as their powerful allies, [[Elminster]] and [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]]. 

==Inhabitants==
As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], about 100 malaugrym occupied the castle. Older malaugrym would generally retire to the castle.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|3}}
