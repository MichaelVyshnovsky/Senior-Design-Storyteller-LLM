The '''Tyr Shrine''' was a temple to [[Tyr]] located in the town of [[Leilon]].{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Divine Contention}}

==Location==
The Shrine was located near the southwestern edge of town overlooking the [[Fishery (Leilon)|Fishery]].

==Services==
In addition to being a place of worship, the Shrine served as a court of law and a place to settle disputes in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The resident [[priest]] was [[Vangol Kuskolt]], who acted as the newly rebuilt town's judge. He settled minor disputes outside on the steps of the Shrine, while those found guilty of crimes he often branded before being driving them from town.

==History==
The Shrine was built in the mid 14{{th}} century DR by Lord [[Pelindar Filmarya]] as Leilon's third temple, with the existing shrines being dedicated to [[Lathander]] and [[Tymora]].

The Shrine was restored in the late 15{{th}} century DR when Leilon was rebuilt by [[Dagult Neverember]].{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Storm Lord's Wrath}} and of [[Tymora Shrine (Leilon)|Tymora]].{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Sleeping Dragon's Wake}} Once repairs were completed, the Shrine was reopened by Vangol Kuskolt.

==Rumors & Legends==
When the [[Cult of Talos]] attached the town in the [[Battle of Leilon]], some townsfolk adopted a rumor that Tyr had promised to elevate any who died in his name as an [[angel]].
