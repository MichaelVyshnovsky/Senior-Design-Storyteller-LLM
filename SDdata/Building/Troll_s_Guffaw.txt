The Troll’s Guffaw was a theater in the Lower Port of Skullport.
The Troll’s Guffaw was a one-story building of good condition. It was modest, consisting of a wooden stage flanked by a stylized proscenium arch and covered by a tattered, patchwork curtain. The stage was constructed from salvaged planks from shipwrecks.
The theater’s troupe of performers consisted entirely of doppelgangers, several of whom are members of the Unseen. They primarily staged adaptations of popular dramas, though these renditions bore little resemblance to their original forms, having been altered to fit the audience’s preference for grisly scenes and dark humor. The doppelganger performers frequently simulated violent acts onstage, often appearing to impale or skewer each other without harm, thanks to their shapeshifting abilities. Other popular acts included bawdy comedies and satires driven by audience participation, allowing the crowd to engage directly with the performance.
Occasionally, the troupe staged true dramas and tragedies under the creative influence of Lady Mirage. Known for her ability to conjure phantasms of chilling realism, Lady Mirage has reportedly caused some audience members to die of fright. This macabre reputation ensured that the theater remains packed each night, as spectators flocked to witness the thrills of Skullport’s most unnerving performances.
Admission to the Troll’s Guffaw is typically 5 silver pieces per person, with two shows offered daily. Each performance lasted roughly an hour, tailored to the short attention spans of the Port of Shadow’s residents.
