        "mainbody": "lar Marus Golden Palace was a prominent general goods emporium in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.\nThis business was located in the Gowntown neighborhood of Ravens Bluffs Temple District, situated at the northeast corner of Raphiel Street and Skulls Street.\nThis business was quite large for a general goods shop, standing four stories tall.\nMany of the floors within Glar Marus could best be described as sagging, likely due to the oppressive weight of the merchandise.\nGlar Marus offered an expansive array of non-perishable goods, such as stepladders or metal mixing bowls that ranged in size from eggcups to bowls large enough for an armored knight to recline within. Some types of items even had entire rooms within the building devoted to them, such as gowns that were out-of-fashion and priestly vestments that had been traded in on account of no longer fitting their owners. The business was willing to purchase any goods offered to them, but would only give copper pieces in return.\nThe shop was monitored by a series of spiders controlled by the wizard owner. Anyone caught stealing from the store would be stricken by these spiders paralyzing bite and have something taken off of them by Glar Maru as compensation.\nThis shop was owned by and named for an old Tashlutan mage by the name of Glar Maru."
