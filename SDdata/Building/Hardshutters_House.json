        "mainbody": "The Hardshutters House was the Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guilds guildhall in the city of Suzail, Cormyr.\nThe Hardshutters House stood on the northern end of Suzails open-air Market, facing south, where Garth Street reached the Market plaza.\nEarly in his career, Ullvor Mharivven commissioned a custom spell that animated glass shards collected in Hardshutters Houses attic. With a single opening of the guildhalls attic, its master could release a whirlwind of sharp glass onto thieves and unwanted guests. The shard storm was similar to the effects of the blade barrier spell.\nThe Hardshutters House offered membership to roofers, slate-masons, shingle-cutters, thatchers, thatch-cutters, glaziers, \"sandglass\" makers, and glass stainers.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Ullvor Mharivven was in change of the guildhall."
