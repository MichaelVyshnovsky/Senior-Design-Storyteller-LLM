        "mainbody": "he Smiling Centaur was a drinking establishment once frequented by former adventuress Zaranda Star.\nThe tavern was located in the city of Zazesspur in Tethyr, within the section of the Low City known as the Fortress, south of the river.\nThe Smiling Centaur was a typical tavern such as found on the Sword Coast or the Vilhon Reach, except that it was built with larger-sized creatures in mind. It had a single large common room with a low ceiling with smoky rafters, which was lit by candles set in wagon wheels hung from chains. On the walls hung oil lamps in caged iron sconces. The tables and chairs were built out of tough materials but were otherwise relatively cheap quality and marked with many knives. A single large hearth&mdashlarge enough to cook an ox&mdashfilled one wall.\nThe tavern sold several less-popular wines.\nThe Smiling Centaur was owned and named after an oft-cheerful centaur named Berdak.\nIn the , then-adventuress Zaranda Star visited the tavern with her traveling companions Vander Stillhawk, Father Pelletyr, Shield of Innocence, and Farlorn Half-Elven. While there, she drank wine with a former companion warrior named Valides. Zaranda and Valides argued local politics, until the latter grew interested in the strange cowled figure in the shadows, who was Shield of Innocence, an unwelcomed-in-most-settings orog. Tensions in the tavern began to rise, but before Shields hood was uncovered, Father Pelletyr suddenly screamed in pain and collapsed to the floor. He had died of heartstop."
