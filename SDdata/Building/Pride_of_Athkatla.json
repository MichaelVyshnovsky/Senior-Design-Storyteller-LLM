        "Description": "The Pride was comprised of rows upon rows of curtained boutiques and mercantile stalls. They were run vendors peddling goods from all around [[Faer√ªn]], anything from [[Tashalar]]an cheese to [[locksmith]]s' hardware. The marketplace was set within the entrance hall of a former temple of [[Savras]].\n\nOne of the more memorable shopkeepers in the Pride was [[Sulrajack]], a gregarious and silver-tongued covert informant who spied on Athkatlans for the [[Cowled Wizards]]."
