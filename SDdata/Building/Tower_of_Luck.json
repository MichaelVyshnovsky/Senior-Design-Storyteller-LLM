        "mainbody": "he Tower of Luck was a temple of Tymora in Waterdeep.\nThe temple stood in the Sea Ward of the city, on the east side of the Street of the Singing Dolphin between Ivory Street and Sighing Maidens Walk.Page 176 of Waterdeep Dragon Heist reports that the temple is located in the Castle Ward, but the poster map included with the adventure correctly places the temple in the Sea Ward, which is consistent with all previous sources. It is assumed that the location reported on p. 176 is in error.\nCirca 1372 DR it was led by Honorable Mistress Seenroas Halvinhar. Members of her clergy included Adama Miiralin and Lamris Kholl."
