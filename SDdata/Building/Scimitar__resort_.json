The place was managed by the Janyskyvaar Cabal, a holding company watching over the interests of the majority shareholder, the Jashire family of Riatavin.\nCustomers entered the resort through a fortified gateway constantly guarded by mercenaries.\nThe resort was founded by a priest of Waukeen after he discovered mineral springs in Akaravs Bay, giving his name to the bay in the process."
