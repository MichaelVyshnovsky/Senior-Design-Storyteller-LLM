        "mainbody": "The Anchorage was a cozy inn of well repute in Harrowdale.\nThe Anchorage was located near the center of town at the intersection of Melurk Street and Moonside Lane.\nEach of the rooms of the Anchorage was practically sound proof thanks to thick stone walls and tapestries. Every room featured its own fire grate and enough furnishing to make a guest feel right at home.\nRooms at the Anchorage cost 14 sp per night per head, but that price included meals and stabling of a single beast. Any drink other than milk or mintwater cost extra, as did storing a wagon or stabling extra beasts.\nThe Anchorage was staffed by four familes and plenty of children were around to help with chores and they were surprisingly well-behaved."
