Dragontriumph Hall was a room in Castle Obarskyr of Suzail in the late 15 century DR.
To Amarune Whitewaves sense of direction, Dragontriumph Hall was almost at the south wall of the palace and three stories above ground floor.
One of the entrances, a double door, was flanked by gilt statues.
At least end of the room had high windows, from which one could see the windows from across the courtyard. Between those windows, there were pillars, from which portraits hung. One portrait showed a masked princess, wearing a crown and holding another bloody crown, and another portrait showed a king in blood-drenched armor, holding a chalice in the middle of a battlefield while standing atop his horse.
The Open Feast of  was held therein, at Castle Obarskyr.
