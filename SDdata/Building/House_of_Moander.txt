The '''House of Moander''' was a temple of [[Moander]] near the town of [[Ylraphon]] and the [[Flooded Forest]] in [[the Vast]].

==Location==
The House of Moander lay north of Ylraphon, amidst the boggy woodlands beside the Flooded Forest, which encroached on the ruined city's northeast. Like other temples in this area, it was likely built on raised and drier areas of the swamp.

==Inhabitants==
In its ruined state, the temple was the lair of a number of greater [[darktentacle]]s.

==History==
The House of Moander was ruined and destroyed by [[1367 DR]].

In the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], the [[Six Spiked Rings]] adventurers explored the House of Moander. The darktentacles attacked and killed some of their number, but two escaped with treasures won from the temple: a large bag of gems and a sack of metal magic [[wand]]s of great age and power.
