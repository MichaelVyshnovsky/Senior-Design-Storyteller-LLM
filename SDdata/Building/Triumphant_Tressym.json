        "mainbody": "The Triumphant Tressym was a shady festhall in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the Triumphant Tressyms backrooms were selected by Duskrel Bladesemmer to play the Lords of Waterdeep game, away from prying eyes and in the company of well-endowed doxies. He was handed a card by a Harper that read \"Foil Mercenary Companies/Give this Mandatory Quest to a noble of our city. Who must complete it within a year or be revealed as utterly without honor./The Guild of Debonair Slayers, the Wizards of the Sword Coast, the Soldiers Flotsam, the Iron Fist Grenadiers, the Red Ravens, and the Flaming Fist are conspiring to create feuds and armed disputes within the city to create employment for themselves. Stop them and restore peace.\" After dispensing the card, the Harper disappeared through a trap door, leaving Duskrel alone with Zelazarelle and Janathra. The doxies revealed that the Lords game had become all the rage in the City of Splendors and Janathra shared a quest card of her own. The conversation came to an abrupt end when a hurt and disheveled Old Mage, Elminster Aumar, fell on them from the ceiling, being pursued by an assassin. Subsequently, a band of City Watchmen barged into the backrooms attempting to detain the Old Mage, whod been at the center of several investigatons, but Elminster worked his spells and teleported away from the commotion."
