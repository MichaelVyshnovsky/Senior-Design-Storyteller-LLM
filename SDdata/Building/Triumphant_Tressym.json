        "mainbody": "The '''Triumphant Tressym''' was a shady [[festhall]] in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Triumphant Tressym's backrooms were selected by [[Duskrel Bladesemmer]] to play the [[Lords of Waterdeep (in-universe)|Lords of Waterdeep]] game, away from prying eyes and in the company of well-endowed [[doxies]]. He was handed a card by a [[Harper]] that read \"Foil Mercenary Companies/Give this Mandatory Quest to a noble of our city. Who must complete it within a year or be revealed as utterly without honor./The Guild of Debonair Slayers, the Wizards of the Sword Coast, the Soldiers Flotsam, the Iron Fist Grenadiers, the Red Ravens, and the Flaming Fist are conspiring to create feuds and armed disputes within the city to create employment for themselves. Stop them and restore peace.\" After dispensing the card, the Harper disappeared through a trap door, leaving Duskrel alone with [[Zelazarelle]] and [[Janathra]]. The doxies revealed that the Lords game had become all the rage in the City of Splendors and Janathra shared a quest card of her own. The conversation came to an abrupt end when a hurt and disheveled Old [[Mage]], [[Elminster Aumar]], fell on them from the ceiling, being pursued by an [[assassin]]. Subsequently, a band of [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watchmen]] barged into the backrooms attempting to detain the Old Mage, who'd been at the center of several investigatons, but Elminster worked his [[spell]]s and ''[[teleport]]ed'' away from the commotion."
