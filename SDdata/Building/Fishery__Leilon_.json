Town councilor Valdi Estapaar was in charge of the Fishery.\nThe Fishery was located at Quayside north of the barge yard.\nThe Fishery was where local fisherfolk sold their catches and most business relating to selling or repairing fishing equipment took place. During the reconstruction efforts, the Fishery also served as a makeshift town hall in the evenings. Outside the Fishery, there was a job board with adverts for adventurers searching for employment."
