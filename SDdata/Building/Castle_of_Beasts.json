        "mainbody": "The '''Castle of Beasts''' was an infamous castle in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Already ruined by the late 9{{th}} century [[DR]], it was used by the [[Flaerin]] and then by [[Sharglar Dulrathran]].",
        "Location": "The castle was east of where [[Kurrsh]] was in the late 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Defenses": "The castle's surroundings were full of monsters brought there by the Flaerin, a family of [[doppleganger]]s, though some of the monsters had been created by [[deepspawn]] hidden within the castle. These same deepspawn disgorged [[orc]]s and cattle regularly to feed their spawn. The inside of the castle remained full of monsters until at least {{yearlink|887}}.",
        "History": "The castle was already ruined by the 9{{th}} century DR, when Sharglar Dulrathran seized it from the Flaerin.\n\nIn {{yearlink|887}}, [[Kalgrathur Daycloaks]] slew Sharglar Dulrathan at the throne room, after the [[Nightfire Lances]] fought through the monsters prowling the castle."
