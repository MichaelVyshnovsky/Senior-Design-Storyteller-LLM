        "Location": "[[File:Cutlass inn.png|thumb|724x724px|''The exterior of '''Cutlass Inn '''in Luskan.'']]The inn was located on the southern bank in Luskan on [[Half Moon Street]], the last road before the piers themselves. It was a well-known collecting ground for vagabonds and ruffians.<ref>",
        "Structure": "There was a main room with a flight of stairs leading up to a few rooms where women \"entertained\" customers.\n\nThe cellar of the Cutlass was guarded by a [[golem]] anonymously dubbed \"Captain Reaper.\"\n\nThe Cutlass' basement had a hidden door behind two kegs activated via three hidden pressure plates in the basement's walls. The hidden passage led to the [[Luskan/Sewers|Luskan sewers]], which used to be the ruins of [[Illusk]].<ref>",
        "Clientele": "A haven for the crews of the pirate ships docking in the harbor, the Cutlass was a loud and dangerous bar in Luskan that was famous up and down the [[Sword Coast]]. Owned by [[Arumn Gardpeck]], it served pirates, merchants, fences, mercenaries, and all other sorts of colorful personalities. Notoriously dangerous, the Cutlass' common room was renowned for the brawls that broke out and ended up turning fatal. This number increased so much so that the [[High Captain]]s instituted a \"no weapons\" policy in an attempt to steer business to safer venues. This was attempted to no avail as evidenced by the damages done to the inn after spell duels. The Cutlass was essentially one continuous, violent party.",
        "History": "In [[1364 DR]], the famed [[barbarian]] [[Wulfgar]] was hired as a bouncer by Arumn Gardpeck, much to the dismay of [[Josi Puddles]], and began a relationship with fellow employee [[Delly Curtie]], eventually taking her away from Luskan and marrying her.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]] Arumn posted a notice on the Cutlass' door about a caravan guard job, heading to [[Targos]], [[Icewind Dale]].<ref>\n\nIn [[1372 DR]] the Cutlass was under [[Aruph Thunderfist]]'s management. During that time the inn was not a bustling business but housed local refugees fleeing from the High Capitas' all-out war for control what was ravaging Luskan. The Cutlass had almost no rooms available and only served watered-down [[ale]] during the long weeks of the conflict.<ref>\n\nIn [[1461 DR]] the Cutlass remained in the hands of the Gardpeck family, with Arumn's great-great-great-grandniece [[Shivanni Gardpeck]] serving as proprietor.\n\nAround [[1487 DR]], Shivanni's bartender, [[Leoril]], was dragged off by members of the [[Order of the Gilded Eye|Gilded Eye]], and she made [[Foley]] stand in for him.<ref>[[En:n-Space|n-Space]] (October 2015).
