Cragmaw Castle was a castle in Neverwinter Wood on the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.

Cragmaw Castle lay in the southwest corner of the Neverwinter Wood, and northeast of the Cragmaw Hideout.
The building was made of stone, and had several towers, many of which had collapsed. It had a well-protected main entrance, with two archer posts looking straight at any who would approach the castle. Cragmaw Castle also had a side entrance to the south that was far less guarded.
The inside of the building had several traps laid around. The rooms consisted of barracks, storage areas, a banquet hall, a shrine to Maglubiyet, and the quarters of King Grol.
After its initial construction, humans inhabited the castle.
In the 15 century DR, it was inhabited by goblins, hobgoblins, a bugbear, a grick, a wolf, and an owlbear, and visited by a doppleganger disguised as a drow elf.

In 1491 DR, Cragmaw Castle was the home of King Grol of the Cragmaw tribe, before King Grol was slain by adventurers.
