'''The Eel Revealed''' was a popular eatery on the grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] of the [[Cormyrean]] capital city of [[Suzail]] in 15{{th}} century DR.

==Location==
The eatery stood on the westernmost part of the second block of buildings off Suzail's [[Horngate]]. It was located across the Promenade from the crossing of the [[Mayhap Lane]] and the [[Hunt Bide]].

==Services==
The Eel Revealed was a popular restaurant famous for its [[cheese-and-eel pie]]s, [[sausage]]s, a selection of fortified [[wine]]s, and strapping young jacks and wenches who served them while flexing their [[oil]]ed bodies. Another dish served was a big [[platter]] of tender cooked [[morel]]s and [[eel]]s in [[sardragon sauce]] (disdainfully called "[[Marsember|Marsembian]] glop" in [[Castle Obarskyr]]'s kitchens).

The restaurant was open for the early dinner service and early hours of the dawn.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Suzailan Lord [[Arclath Delcastle]] was a loyal customer of the eatery. Two of the beautiful young oiled waitresses at the time was [[Emsra]] and [[Varimbra]], and a cook named [[Laethla]] worked the Eel's kitchens.
