        "mainbody": "he White-Winged Griffon, known locally as the Whitewings, was a rundown inn found in the city of Yartar.\nIt was an old and drafty wooden house that offered little comfort from the frigid winds of the North. Privacy was granted by the thin partitions, which did little more than separate each room.\nAs of the 14 century DR, it was infested with rats.\nThe Whitewings offered small single-bed rooms of poor quality for the rock-bottom fee of 1 cp per night. Use of the soap bucket however, had an exorbitant fee of 1 gp.\nInterestingly enough, the inn did offer services to individuals other than its patrons. Its proprietors were informants for the Zhentarim and the Hand of Yartar, and regularly fed them information regarding those that stayed within their establishment."
