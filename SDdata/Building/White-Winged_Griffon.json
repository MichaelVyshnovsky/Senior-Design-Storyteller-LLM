Use of the soap bucket however, had an exorbitant fee of 1 [[gp]].\n\nInterestingly enough, the inn did offer services to individuals other than its patrons. Its proprietors were informants for the [[Zhentarim]] and the [[Hand of Yartar]], and regularly fed them information regarding those that stayed within their establishment."
