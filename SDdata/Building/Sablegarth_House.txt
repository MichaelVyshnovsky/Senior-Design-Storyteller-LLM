The '''Sablegarth House''' was a striking residence located in the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of the most noteworthy buildings on [[Falyern Way]] within the city's [[Tentowers]] neighborhood.

Looking more like a palace rather than a family's home, Sablegarth did serve as the city residence for the noble [[Hawkdragon]] family, during the scant amount of time they spent in Ravens Bluff. It featured a facade of stunning black marble, that easily caught the eye.
