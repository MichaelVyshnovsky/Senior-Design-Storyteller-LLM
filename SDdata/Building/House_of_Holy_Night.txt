The '''House of Holy Night''' was a temple to [[Shar]] standing in the [[Shaar]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Winds from the Shaar cooled the House of Holy Night.

==Interior==
An archway known as the Inner Portal separated the Sacred Chamber of Shar, the innermost and holiest section of the Temple, from the rest of the building.

==Activities==
Numerous acts of [[Sharran]] worship took place at the House of Holy Night, most of them sacrifices of blood and pain.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, the House of Holy Night was the site of a unique ritual of the Church of Shar, wherein an [[avatar]] of [[Mystra]], the sorceress [[Dasumia]], was held captive through constant [[human]] sacrifice, as a result granting every Sharran worshiper there [[wizard]]ly spells.

Capitalizing on the chaos they'd created, the Sharrans were also sent on missions to slay [[mage]]s and seize [[magic]] in their time of weakness. Another mission assigned by Darklady [[Avroana]] was to seek out and slay the [[Chosen of Mystra]], [[Elminster Aumar]], who'd been spotted in [[Westgate]] as reported by [[Elryn]], a wizardly faithful. Somehow, during the attack on Elminster at [[Karsus' Keep]], a spell of flames reached all the way to Darklady Avroana, who found her death at the hands of an acolyte who accidentally sacrificed her to Shar.
