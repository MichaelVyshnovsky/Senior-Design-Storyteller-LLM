The House of Holy Night was a temple to Shar standing in the Shaar in the midâ€“8 century DR.
Winds from the Shaar cooled the House of Holy Night.
An archway known as the Inner Portal separated the Sacred Chamber of Shar, the innermost and holiest section of the Temple, from the rest of the building.
Numerous acts of Sharran worship took place at the House of Holy Night, most of them sacrifices of blood and pain.
In the , the House of Holy Night was the site of a unique ritual of the Church of Shar, wherein an avatar of Mystra, the sorceress Dasumia, was held captive through constant human sacrifice, as a result granting every Sharran worshiper there wizardly spells.
Capitalizing on the chaos theyd created, the Sharrans were also sent on missions to slay mages and seize magic in their time of weakness. Another mission assigned by Darklady Avroana was to seek out and slay the Chosen of Mystra, Elminster Aumar, whod been spotted in Westgate as reported by Elryn, a wizardly faithful. Somehow, during the attack on Elminster at Karsus Keep, a spell of flames reached all the way to Darklady Avroana, who found her death at the hands of an acolyte who accidentally sacrificed her to Shar.
