The Gate of Dragons was found in the city of Muluk in the Free Cities of Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Gate of Dragons was located on the northern wall of the city within close proximity to al-Zalim River.
A pair of dragons were artfully carved into the framework of the gate, giving the portal its name.
A garrison of 200 soldiers was stationed at the Gate of Dragons, making the gate a fortress as much as it was an entryway into Muluk.
