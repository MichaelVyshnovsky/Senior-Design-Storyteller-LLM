The '''Friendly Familiar''' was a pet store in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] that sold both common and exotic animals as pets.

==Geography==
This shop was along [[Hippocampus Street]], in the [[Stormrime]] neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's [[Southside District]]. It was a block down from the [[Quill and Scribe]] and around the corner from [[Horace's Shirt Shop]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Structure==
The Friendly Familiar was a large, single story building constructed of stone. Outside of the store was a sign depicting a black cat sleeping atop a treasure chest. In the back of the building was an open-air courtyard that was closed in at the rear by a large, sturdy wooden fence. The owner tried to exercise his animals within this courtyard as much as possible, though he also used it for whenever he was training.

==Interior==
The interior of the Friendly Familiar was notably very tidy.{{Cite polyhedron/45/The Living City: The Friendly Familiar Pet Shop|7}}

A door in the far-right of the store led into kennels, which had separate areas for the domestic dogs and the more wild and aggressive kind. A door in the far-left led into the mews, where birds were kept tied by short cords to perches spread well apart. This was done in order to prevent them from injuring themselves or each other. The owner also stored his hawking clothes and equipment in that area.

The central most door in the rear of the building let out to the courtyard, which had doors leading into the aforementioned rooms as well as large stalls. Larger animals, such as big cats and [[horse]]s, were kept here as well as sick animals that needed to be quarantined. These stalls were most often empty.

===Atmosphere===
Those who entered the store could easily tell that the animals therein were well cared for.

==Services==
The Friendly Familiar sold both common and exotic animals as pets, though its owner refused to sell intelligent creatures for moral reasons, viewing such an act as [[slavery]]. Besides selling animals, his services included training them and caring for those who were sick or injured. He was even known to care for sick or injured wildlife. Besides the animal services he offered, the owner would frequently hire [[adventurer]]s to capture exotic "monsters" to fill in the special orders he got for pets.

His stock of animals often included the basic domestic [[cat]] and [[dog]], but he also carried [[cooshee]]s, [[war dog]]s, and the cubs of big cat. He always had at least four large and clean dogs within his kennels. In terms of birds he typically had [[falcon]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[parrot]]s, [[songbird]]s, and [[owl]]s.

In terms of reptiles he typically carried small [[snake]]s and [[Constrictor snake|constrictors]]. Finally, in terms of more wild fare he was known to carry [[badger]] cubs, [[bear]] cubs, and [[wolf]] cubs.{{Cite polyhedron/45/The Living City: The Friendly Familiar Pet Shop|31}} However, he did not regularly keep large animals in stock.

==Inhabitants==
This business was operated by the retired adventurer [[Derry Brandondale]], who lived in the store with his two [[blink dog]]s [[Armas (blink dog)|Armas]] and [[Seth]]. He was very polite and helpful with customers, though wary of strangers and tended to do business with them behind the safety of his counter. There he kept a [[sword]] hidden just in case trouble ever arose. 

Armas and Seth moved about the store as they pleased. They slept in the same quarters as Derry, though they would also take turns watching over the store at night.

The shop was a popular destination among traveling adventurers.

==Reputation==
The Friendly Familiar was well known in Ravens Bluff and considered a respectable business.{{Cite organized play/LC/Call of the Griffon (3e)|5}}
