The Lathander Shrine, also called the Shrine of Lathander, was a temple to Lathander located in the town of Leilon.
The Shrine was located on the southern side of town overlooking the Barge Yard.
Worshipers of Lathander were welcome to come inside and pray at a small stone altar. The Shrine held services each morning at dawn.
Curative magical services were available in exchange for donations. When the Shrine was rebuilt in the late 15 century DR, head priest Merrygold Brightshine provided cure wounds in thanks for donations of 10 gold pieces and lesser restoration for 20 gold pieces. For free, Merrygold was glad to provide advice to any who prayed at the Shrines altar.
The Shrine that stood in the 15 century DR was not the original as another Shrine to Lathander had been one of Leilons first major temples prior to Leilons destruction.
When Leilon was rebuilt by Dagult Neverember in the late 15 century DR, the church of Lathander paid for the honor of having their ruined Shrine be the first temple to be rebuilt. Merrygold assisted in the refounding of the town on the churchs behalf, and the staff of the Shrine used their spare time to care for and feed the workers rebuilding the town.
During its reconstruction, the Shrine welcomed any faithful of Lathander who wished to help make the new temple bigger or better.
When Jack Torver arrived to open the new towns first general store, he would attend each mornings service and share the wisdom from Merrygolds sermons with his customers.
