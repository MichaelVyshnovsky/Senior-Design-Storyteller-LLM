It was considered by some to be among the best such establishments in all the crystal spheres. Its owners were unknown, but were rumored to be adventurers, and it was managed by Shrii Hallek.\nThe tavern stood in the High City part of Bral, on Grand Street and at the end of High Street. It stood between House Cartan and the Royal Theatrical Company, and backed onto Lake Bral.\nIt had an amazing view over Lake Bral.\nThe Man O War had such a high reputation for elegance and safety that the rulers of Bral had visiting diplomats stay here when guestrooms in the Starhaven palace were fully occupied. Hallek was very respectful to guests.\nThere was a strict dress code in the dining room, and both weapons and armor were proscribed for patrons.\nSecurity was provided by a force of elite mercenaries who were paid very well to guarantee guests safety.\nA standard dinner cost as much as 8–12 gp per person, but the food was top quality and the best in Bral, while the service was exceptional.\nMoreover, it had ten luxurious suites of rooms that could be rented for 10–30 gp per night.
