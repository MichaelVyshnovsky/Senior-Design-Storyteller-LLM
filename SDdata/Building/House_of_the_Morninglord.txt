The '''House of the Morninglord''' in [[Bryn Shander]] was the town's place of worship for the Keeper of the Eternal Sun, [[Amaunator]]. It was overseen by the devout and irrepressible [[cleric]] [[Mithann]].

==Location==
The shrine was located in the northeastern region of the city, a ways off from its central market square.

==Structure==
The shrine was established in a small converted house.

==Services==
Mithann offered a view on Amaunator that differed from the cities of the south. She cast away the austere and unyielding traits typically associated with the deity, and sought to cast him in a more uplifting light.

===Activities===
While the sun did not shine over the [[Ten Towns]] for two months of the [[Calendar of Harptos|year]],

==History==
Circa the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the House of the Morninglord offered shelter to the [[Lathander]]ite [[gnome]] [[Copper Knobberknocker]] after he had enough staying at the isolated [[Black Cabin]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|103}}
