Shatterblades was a festhall in the Lower Port of Skullport.
Shatterblade’s was a one-story festhall of fair condition.
The decor was both gaudy and vibrant, with the main taproom featuring three chandeliers—perfect for the occasional swashbuckling display.
The food and drink at Shatterblades was of good quality, though patrons were advised to be prepared for the possibility of a brawl, given the rowdy clientele. Prices were high, reflecting the quality of the offerings. The festhall also offered the company of professional escorts, and its staff, seasoned by experience, quickly learned to anticipate impending conflicts and discreetly retreat to private rooms as tensions rose.
Shatterblades was owned by Rhaunaguth, a former buccaneer and mercenary leader. Named for the mithral shield that Rhaunaguth famously wields in battle, the establishment was primarily a meeting place for his sellsword associates. At any given time, a minimum of ten of Rhaunaguths mercenaries could be found here. These chainmail-clad fighters were armed with long swords, light crossbows, and daggers.
