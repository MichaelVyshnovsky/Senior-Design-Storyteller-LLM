Felogyrs Fireworks was a shop that sold fireworks, torches, candle wicks and other lesser alchemical items in Baldurs Gate.
The four-story stone building was segregated. The top two floors were a dedicated workshop and were off-limits to any customers.
Felogyrs specialized in illuminating items, such as candles, projectiles, and torches, that burned in special hues or gave off an extraneous amount of smoke.
They also sold rubs used in the cooking of meat that imbued it with a delightful smoky taste.

As of the the late 15 century DR, Felogyrs maintained sole production of smokepowder within Baldurs Gate. The shop provided the explosive commodity to the Baldurian church of Gond and the Council of Four exclusively while limiting smokepowder sales to others in the form of fireworks alone.
Some time during this period, on the night of Flamerule 7, Felogyrs decided to celebrate the annual festival of Lliiras Night by setting off fireworks. Overtime this quickly became a staple tradition within the Holiday for many people across the Sword Coast.
Some time in the , someone managed to break into the workshop area and stole four kegs of smokepowder. In its place, the thief left a depiction of a phoenix.
