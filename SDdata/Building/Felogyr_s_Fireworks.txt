'''Felogyr's Fireworks''' was a shop that sold [[firework]]s, [[torch]]es, [[candle]] [[wick]]s and other lesser [[alchemical]] items in [[Baldur's Gate]].

{{quote|''I wish you the best of luck, and do stop by my shop in Baldur's Gate for supplies, advice, and camaraderie. I am always keen to meet like minds for explosive conversation!''|Excerpt from ''[[Boom, Bang, Blast: The Joy of Fireworks]]''}}

==Description==
The four-story stone building was segregated. The top two floors were a dedicated workshop and were off-limits to any customers.

==Services==
Felogyr's specialized in illuminating items, such as candles, projectiles, and torches, that burned in special hues or gave off an extraneous amount of smoke.

They also sold rubs used in the cooking of meat that imbued it with a delightful smoky taste.

==History==
[[File:Felogyr's Fireworks interior.jpg|thumb|''The first floor's showroom.''|340x340px]]
As of the the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Felogyr's maintained sole production of [[smokepowder]] within Baldur's Gate. The shop provided the explosive commodity to the Baldurian [[church of Gond]] and the [[Council of Four]] exclusively while limiting smokepowder sales to others in the form of fireworks alone.

Some time during this period, on the night of [[Flamerule 7]], Felogyr's decided to celebrate the annual festival of [[Lliira's Night]] by setting off fireworks. Overtime this quickly became a staple tradition within the Holiday for many people across the [[Sword Coast]].

Some time in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, someone managed to break into the workshop area and stole four kegs of smokepowder. In its place, the thief left a depiction of a [[phoenix]].
