The '''Temple of Myrkul''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Myrkul]] in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]].

==Location==
This temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Talona (Bezantur)|Temple of Talona]] to the west, the temples of [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Sune]] and [[Temple of Tempus (Bezantur)|Tempus]] to the north, and the [[Temple of Leira (Bezantur)|Temple of Leira]] to the east.

==Structure==
The temple was a proud structure built of [[gold|gilded]] wood.

==Interior==
The temple contained a shrine to [[Shar]] prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] as it was customary for Thayans to honor both Shar and Myrkul whenever a loved one died.

==History==
Myrkul had been one of the primary [[god]]s worshiped in Thay prior to the Time of Troubles, but after his death during that event, most of his worshipers turned to [[Cyric]] or [[Kelemvor]]. By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this temple was perhaps the last site dedicated to his worship in all of [[Faer√ªn]], and was overseen by [[Dhimar]], the powerless former high [[priest]].
