The '''Irithlium''' was a renowned school for [[wizard]]s found in the once-great city of [[Myth Drannor]]. After the fall of the City of Song in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], the fabled school fell to ruin, attracting scavengers and other malevolent beings that sought to capture some of the powerful magics housed within.

{{Quote|It was once a magic school...The upper layers seem to have been stripped bare, but there are least six [[phaerimm]] lairing somewhere beneath the foundations.|Officer Parth Gal of the [[Shadovar]] military, in [[1372 DR]].}}

==Location==
It was located in the [[Kerradunath|Noble's Ward]] of Myth Drannor, where Danglestar Street intersected with Dragon's Drive. 

==Structure==
The Irithlium comprised a central building, around which were built four separate wings and turrets of varying design. Little regard was given to a common architectural design, as none of the side structures shared the same features. While the southern and western wings each went as high up as six stories tall, the other two only reached four stories.

Extending underneath the school were an additional three subterranean floors. and protected with lethal traps.

Even deeper beneath the underground levels was an expansive [[limestone]] cavern network. Its chambers were lined with cages used to imprison a wide variety of monstrous creatures.

==History==
The construction of the wizarding school was a continual project that continued on for over three centuries.

Following the destruction of Myth Drannor, the Irithlium became surrounded by a [[dead-magic zone]]. When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] took over part of the ruins, in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, wizards of their order attempted to bypass the zone's effects.{{Template:Cite book/Pool of Radiance: Attack on Myth Drannor|22}}

Within a few months after the [[phaerimm]] were released from beyond the [[Sharn Wall]] in [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, at least a half dozen of the creatures had made their lair within the catacombs of the Irithlium.

On [[Mirtul 19]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Prince [[Escanor Tanthul]] tasked [[Vala Thorsdotter]] and the [[Shadovar]] officer [[Parth Gal]] with scouting out the phaerimm activity within the ruins of the school. Together with an [[Cornneus Drannaeken|undead ally]], she rid the depths of the Irithlium from the aberrant presence.

==Inhabitants==
The depths of the Irithlium were home to dangerous creatures including [[monstrous centipede]]s and even [[dark naga]]s.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Corinneus Drannaeken]], a [[baelnorn]] sworn to guard the Irithlium in undeath.
