        "mainbody": "The Drestin was the seat of power for the Khaldomaun, or ruler, of Yeshpek in the Lake of Steam region of south Faer√ªn.\nThis large palace was constructed in a circular design and topped with an impressive dome. The central hall was decorated with a gigantic floating octopus preserved and animated with magic. The octopus was slain in Yeshpeks harbor long ago. Its movements were said to mimic the mood of the Khaldomaun whose throne was situated directly beneath it. The creatures beak stored several healing potions and other magic.\nIn addition to housing the Khaldomaun and his family, the Drestin housed all of Yeshpeks banks."
