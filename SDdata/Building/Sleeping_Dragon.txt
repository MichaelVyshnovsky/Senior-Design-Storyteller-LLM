The '''Sleeping Dragon''' was an inn near [[Rassalantar]] on the [[Long Road]] north of [[Waterdeep]]. {{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}} 

==Structure==
The inn was equipped with stables and privies, and both the east and west walls of the main building had chimneys. 

===Interior===
Its main door was at the southeast corner, and the main fireplace was on the west wall. A bar with high stools ran halfway along the northern wall, with a rare huge mirror behind it. The kitchen was on the east side of the building, accessible through an archway. The east wall of the main room had cloak pegs, crates, barrels and stairs up to the upper floor. Up against the southern wall were nine long tables with benches, and the middle of the room was filled with round tables and chairs. The upper level consisted of a short hallway with doors to seven rooms, and windows overlooking the entrance.

==Inhabitants==
As of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the innkeeper of the Sleeping Dragon was [[Thrun Samallahan|Thrun "Spider" Samallahan]]. 

The [[Shield dwarf]] [[Yondral Horn]] served as Innkeeper during the late 15{{th}} century DR. She spied on any members of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdhavian City Guard]] or [[Lords' Alliance]] agents on behalf of the [[Zhentarim]].

==Services==
The inn served Spider's own brew, called [[Sleeping Dragon dark]].

==History==
On [[Uktar 28]] [[1374 DR]], [[Raegar Stoneblade]] and [[Damlath]] brought the ''[[Diamondblade]]'' to the inn. Upon the arrival of [[Gamalon Idogyr|Lord Gamalon Idogyr]], his wife, and his party, Gamalon's green gem eye caused lightning bolts to transmit between it and the blade, destroying the front of the building and a large area of the upper floor, and blowing away the roof.

==Rumors and Legends==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, there was a rumor that a female employee of the inn was a [[gold dragon]] in [[human]] form.
