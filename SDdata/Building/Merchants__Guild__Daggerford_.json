        "mainbody": "he Merchants Guild was the guildhall for the various merchants and businesspeople in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe guildhall was located where the southern arm of Rogar Alley met the High Road in central Daggerford near the drill field. It was one of the larger buildings found along the High Road.\nThe first floor of this building was cut out as if it were a basement, while the second floor was used as the primary meeting hall. The guildhall was haphazardly decorated with statues, pottery, and carvingsâ€“none of which blended well with any of the other decor.\nMeetings held here between the various merchants of Daggerford with the hopes of gaining a communal influence over the city council was mostly a waste of time given the merchants inherent competitive nature against each other."
