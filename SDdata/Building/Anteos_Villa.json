        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1335}}, Lord [[Hamar Anteos]] had an affair with [[Kyara Ruldegost]], a young [[Tethyrian]] woman distantly related to the [[Ruldegost]] clan. The lord of that clan at the time, the ill-tempered [[Econ Ruldegost]], was incensed by the matter that he engaged Hamar in a duel and lost his life. With his dying breath he laid a [[curse]] upon House Anteos, proclaiming that they would be, \"...heirless until they recognize and accept the ruin they have done me and mine.\"{{Cite web/Realms by Night/Part Five: The Crying Girl}}\n\nSoon after the death of Lord Econ, the couple bore a daughter. Later that year, Kyara and her baby would be murdered by \"brigands\" on their way to a picnic being hosted on a plot of land owned by House Anteos near [[Westwood]]. Rather than a proper burial, their bodies would be dumped into the [[Stump Bog]].\n\nFrom that day forward Kyara's [[ghost]] haunted the Anteos Villa, becoming one of the strongest and most persistent hauntings of any villa in the city. She appeared each night, manifesting in the mansion's every window and open external doorway. She was said to appear with a bloody and muddy dress, a tear-stained face, and clutching a blue-faced baby whose vacant eyes were piercing.\n\nAfter only twelve years, Kyara's haunting drove Lord Hamar to such heights of madness that he died in a fit of screaming. However, even with his death her haunting continued, preventing the members of House Anteos from sleeping well. Over time, Kyara's ghost became known by Waterdhavians as the \"Crying Girl.\""
