The Wanton Wyvern was a tavern near the Hullack Forest during the mid-14 century DR.
The tavern was just outside the western edge of Hullack Forest, close to the East Way, which traveled through the forest west towards Arabel.
The construction was sprawling. The rooms were simple, but warm and clean. The galleries had low ceilings.
Just inside the doors lay a lobby, on which a stair led up to a landing. Another stair from the landing led to a gallery with rooms.
The inside of the tavern was dusty and dark. The rooms were simple, but warm and clean. There were a number of ragged standards hanging from the walls, which had once been spoils of battle. The taverns indoor walls were wooden, rather than stone.
Besides food, the place had the amenities for a bath.
The tavern was protected by a tall fence and gate. A shield hanging by the gate labeled "Strike to enter" was used by travelers to signal to the staff. Inside, a number of loaded crossbows were kept, hanging ready behind the bar.
Mirt suggested heading for the Wanton Wyvern to Shandril Shessair after joining her at Tethgard during her voyage from the Dalelands to Silverymoon in . On exiting Hullack Forest, they arrived at the Wanton Wyvern within the night. They met Baergasra, a friend of Mirts, in passing. They also met Thomd, the innkeeper. While inside, Shandril briefly dozed off when she woke up, Osber, a local Zhentarim fighter, attempted to capture her. During the fight, Narm Tamaraith, Shandrils husband, was poisoned. Mirt called upon Baergasras help, and Thomd was told to draw her a bath.
Osber was a regular at the tavern. Baergasra, disguised as a leprous beggar, spent two years at the gate to spy on tavern-goers. Thomd was an innkeeper for at least that long.
