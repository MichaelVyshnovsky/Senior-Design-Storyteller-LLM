The Smilin Boar was a restaurant located in the well-off neighborhood of Bloomridge, in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate during the 15 century DR. It was owned and operated by a halfling named Jentha Allinamuch.
As per the name, the restaurants signboard featured a smiling boar that had taken mount atop a sow. 
The menu of the Boar featured renamed, bawdier versions of traditional breakfast dishes. such as "sows delight" and "three pigs in a blanket". Coffee and tea were served in mugs that were shaped like a pigs head. Many believed this was done to cause a stir within the rather prim community members of the affluent Baldurian neighborhood.
Before it was a restaurant, the Smilin Boar was a rather unsuccessful tavern. The owner Jentha renovated the building to offer a view of Gray Harbor and played up the establishments quirky name. By 1482 DR, the Boar had become one of the trendiest caf√©s in Baldurs Gate.
Some time around the , dead bodies began to appear in the alley behind the Smilin Boar. With over a dozen corpses being found over the course of six months, business at the restaurant decreased dramatically. While the Cult of the Dead Three was responsible for these mortifying actions, locals believed it to be the actions of an individual they dubbed the "Sickle Man".
