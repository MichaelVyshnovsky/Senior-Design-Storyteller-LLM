        "mainbody": "'''Grimskalle''' was a [[frost giant]] fortress located on the isle of [[Solstice]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] in the [[Far North]]. It was later claimed by the goddess [[Auril]], as her personal domain when she resided on [[Toril]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It was located dead center on the isle of Solstice, set between gardens of ice sculptures that were formed by the Frostmaiden's ice magic.",
        "Structure": "Grimskalle resembled an imposing skull, adorned with a horned crown. The entirety of its structure was formed of carved ice that emanated a mist of icy air, standing {{SI|600|ft}} tall from base to peak.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Due to its giant origins, the interior layout and furniture set within the build were built to enormous scale."
        },
        "History": "The imposing fortress was originally built for the frost giant queen [[Vassavicken]].\n\nAuril the Frostmaiden hid herself away within Grimskalle while her form appeared on [[Toril]] during the [[Everlasting Rime]], circa the {{yearlinkName|1489}}.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Grimskalle became connected to the appearance of Auril in [[Faer√ªn]]. If her form on the [[Prime Material plane]] was destroyed, the fortress was believed to collapse in on itself.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the time of Auril taking up residence within Grimskalle, only one elderly frost giant named [[Ertgard]] remained within. He dedicated himself to the [[Aurilian]] faith.\n\nAuril's [[roc]] companion [[Iskra]] nested atop the roof of Grimskalle, just as a number of [[ice mephit]]s sat along the walls like [[gargoyle]]s, and the particularly intelligent [[giant walrus]] called [[Ukuma]] dwelled within its dungeon."
