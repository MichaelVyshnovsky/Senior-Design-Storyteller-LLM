==History==
After discovering a magic [[green abalone|abalone]] [[shell]] floating in Waterdeep harbor in [[1369 DR]], [[Meritid Archneie|Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie]] took it as a good omen and petitioned the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] to allow him to construct a temple to Umberlee in the city. The Lords consented and construction was nearing completion in [[1372 DR]].
