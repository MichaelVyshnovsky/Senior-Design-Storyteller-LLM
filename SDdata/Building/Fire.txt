The element of '''fire''' was one of the four fundamental building blocks of matter, both useful and dreadful, warming and consuming, changing and purifying. Despite elements generally playing a neutral role in the cosmos, fire was seen as aggressive and evil by many.<ref><ref>

{{quote|''We're no strangers to pain, we who play with fire. Masters of fire or great archmages alike. Sooner or later, we all get burned.''|[[The Simbul]], Witch-Queen of [[Aglarond]]}}

==Cosmology==
Fire manifested its position in the cosmos as the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], one of the [[Inner Planes]].<ref> The element was also represented there in living form as [[fire elemental]]s.

The ruler over the [[portfolio]] of fire in [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Zakhara]] was the [[elemental lord]] [[Kossuth]],{{Cite web/Villains: Cult of the Eternal Flame}} Beyond [[Realmspace]], [[Sirrion]] the Flowing Flame held the portfolio of fire for the world of [[Krynn]].<ref>

==Magic==
===School of elemental fire===
Many [[magic]]al spells utilized the element of fire.<ref> Elemental fire was recognized as a "school of effect" (rather than one of the eight traditional [[schools of magic]]).<ref> Wizards specializing in this school were called fire [[elementalist]]s.In some areas of the world of [[Mystara]], fire elementalists were called pyromancers.<ref> Fire was opposed to the element of [[water]], both as a school of magic and as a worldview.<ref>

Magic-users in Zakhara had a similar but not identical notion of fire magic in the form of the [[Flame (province)|province of flame]].<ref>

Likewise, the [[wu jen]] of [[Kara-Tur]] divided spells into five elemental groups, including fire.

===Divine fire magic===
A number of deities granted [[Divine magic|divine spells]] that relied on the element, either in the form of the [[elemental fire sphere]],<ref> or the [[fire domain]].<ref><ref>

==Celestial bodies==
[[Spelljammer|Spacefarers]] also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the [[crystal sphere]]s. Fire bodies were often found at the center of a crystal sphere, giving light and warmth to all its worlds. [[The sun]] of [[Realmspace]] (as its only fire body) was just such an example.<ref>|74-76}}<ref>
