'''Hallix Mausoleum''' was the family tomb of the [[Hallix]] family of [[Neverwinter]].

==Location==
It was located on the west side of the [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath#Main Graveyard|Main Graveyard]] of [[Neverdeath Graveyard]], in a cluster of tombs along the wall separating the Main and [[Neverwinter/Neverdeath#Pauper's Section|Pauper's Graveyards]]. The mausoleum itself lay in the shadow of two much grander structures to its south and west.

==Structure==
The mausoleum was a plain and squat single-story building of [[granite]] that was {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} on a side. It was entered via metal double doors on its north side, which were kept secured by a rusty [[chain]] and [[padlock]].

==Interior==
The inside of the mausoleum was dark with a {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes}} ceiling. The ground level contained three stone coffins on both the east and west walls, each bearing the name, birth year, and death year of a member of the Hallix family buried within. A wide set of stairs descended to the south into a large subterranean stone chamber lined with sturdy shelves holding additional stone coffins containing long-dead members of the family. In the south wall of this chamber, a secret passage&mdash;opened via a hidden latch within a coffin in front of it&mdash;connected the mausoleum to the [[Waterclock Guild's Crypts]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the western wall of the underground chamber had collapsed, thus allowing access to the catacombs beneath Neverdeath.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the ground level of the mausoleum held the bodies of six Hallix family members who died following the [[eruption of Mount Hotenow]].

During the 1490s DR,{{Vecna-time}} the mausoleum and the catacombs beneath it came to be occupied by cultists of [[Vecna]] led by [[Jerot Galgin]].

The cultists eventually used the area to imprison a group of four Neverwintan nobles&mdash;[[Eldon Keyward]], [[Indrina Lamsensettle]], [[Sarcelle Malinosh]], and [[Umberto Noblin]]&mdash;prompting Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] to send [[adventurer]]s to rescue them.
