The '''Dark Moon monastery''' was one of the headquarters of the [[Order of the Dark Moon]], a monastic order dedicated to the goddess [[Shar]].

{{Quote|Today you enter her umbra, baring not just your body and mind but also your souls to the Mistress of the Night. As you train in the darkest mysteries, you too will hear the whispers of the goddess.|[[Gamaz]], to a group of Dark Moon initiates.}}

==Location==
The monastery was nested within the [[Cloud Peaks]] in [[West Faer√ªn]], near the northern border of [[Amn]].

==Structure==
The temple was carved directly into the stone facade of a mountain in the peaks. A winding path of stairs and carved stone walkway, flanked by four, statue-topped pillars, gave way to the monastery's entrance.

==Interior==

The entrance of the monastery led into a central, column-lined chamber that housed a simple altar dedicated to Shar. Along the wings of the alter were the monks' living quarters, a simple kitchen, and a minor library. A hallway beyond the central altar led to the inner sanctum of he Dark Moon.

Beyond the monastery was a spacious cavern that held numerous cages. Imprisoned within these cages were numerous monsters and creatures, such as [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[giant spider]]s, and [[gibberling]]s. At the rear of the cave were a pair of magically-altered cages that could only be opened by solving a riddle.

The cave path extended further away from the monastery, to a secluded, mountainside ledge. This area housed a secluded shrine, set at the foot of a massive statue of Shar. The goddess was depicted in shrouded garb, carrying a dagger in each hand, arms crossed over her chest.

===Atmosphere===
The monastery featured a simple layout and plain decor. Dark purple carpets and [[holy symbol]]s of Shar decorated the inner sanctum.

==Activities==
The monastery served as a recruiting place for new initiates to the Order of the Dark Moon.

==History==
For some time before [[Era of Upheaval]], the temple of the Cloud Peaks was dedicated to [[Tempus]], the god of Battles. Tempus' followers abandoned their post during the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, to join the [[avatar]] of their god in [[Battledale]].

Some time later, the [[Tempuran]] devotee [[Jasper Banff]] returned to the temple, only to find it had been taken over by the monks of the Dark Moon. He was unfortunately captured and imprisoned within the caves behind the monastery.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Sun Soul monk]] [[Rasaad yn Bashir]] traveled to the monastery after evading numerous assassination attempts made upon him by the Dark Moon. At the entrance of the temple, he encountered his brother [[Gamaz]], who he believed to have been killed many years earlier in [[Athkatla]].

Rasaad and his allies broke through the temple and defeated many of the [[Sharran]] monks. Gamaz and his acolytes attacked Rasaad and his group, but were ultimately defeated. Gamaz apologized to his brother for turning away from the [[Way of the Sun Soul]], but took solace that his death was at his brother's hand.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Bassano]], a spy of the Dark Moon who was adept at manipulating others.
* [[Gamaz]], the leader of the monastery and devout acolyte of [[Alorgoth]].
