Hagalas Manyturrets was an old and rather drafty inn in the village of Amphail.
This inn rented out their rooms at a price of 1 silver piece per person for each night, though one could instead opt to pay 8 silver pieces to stay for a tenday. This rental fee did not provide any food, though Hagalas always had tankards of cold ale and bowls of hot soup on offer at a cost of 1 copper piece.
