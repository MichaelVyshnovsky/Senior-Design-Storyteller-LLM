The '''Upstream Span''' was a bridge across the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]].

==Location==
Of the three bridges that crossed the River Mirar within Luskan (the other two being [[Dalath's Span]] and the [[Harbor Cross]]), the Upstream Span was&mdash;appropriately&mdash;the furthest upstream and therefore the northernmost. [[Baliver's House of Horses]] was situated at the south end of this bridge.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle||26-27}}

==History==

}}After Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the Upstream Span was nearly destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river. In the decades that followed, local gangs would occasionally try to make repairs to the bridge&mdash;sometimes by simply fashioning a makeshift crossing out of [[rope]]s&mdash;in hopes of charging tolls. The bridge remained impassable through the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, but was usable by the {{YearlinkName|1483}}, albeit crumbing, treacherous, and controlled by [[Ship Rethnor]], who demanded tolls for its use. By the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the Upstream Span had been fully restored.
