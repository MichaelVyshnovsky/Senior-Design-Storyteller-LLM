        "mainbody": "The Oasis was a theater that operated in the Little Calimshan district of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. It was known for the rich production values of its show and lavish spectacles it was capable of exhibiting.\nThe theater was owned by the extravagant self-styled director Jonas Goodnight, a brilliant artist who found himself deeply in debt for his art. \nShows at the Oasis included all manner of live arts from plays, burlesque shows, musical performances, and acrobatic demonstrations to more dramatic public offerings such as menageries of dangerous monsters and garish demonstrations of illusion magic.\nThe theater was known for putting on risque shows that satirized well-known Baldurians, despite the inherent risk of drawing their ire.\nIn 1482 DR, the Oasis was a drab bungalow that hosted gambling events. It was generally protected by guards of the Guild. However, the owner Ibiz fell out with Nine-Fingers, the leader of the criminal organization, causing many regulars and Guild agents to leave. Since then, only a handful of patrons remained. The same year, Marshal Ulder Ravengard of the Flaming Fist wished to shut down this establishment, and sent his goons to make it so.\nAs of 1492 DR, the establishment had become a theater under different management. The Guild lent the theater much gold to continue the lavish productions, and as such, the owner of the Oasis went into debt. The criminal group were more than willing to take over the theater should Jonas not pay his debts."
