The Gilded Feather was a pretty-parlor, or beauty salon, located in Suzail, the capital of Cormyr in the 15 century DR.
The Gilded Feather stood on Suzails grand Promenade, two city blocks west of Castle Obarskyr with Danains hardware store and the Witch-Dukes Bride as its neighbors to the east. By the late 15 century DR, the Gilded Feather was the most prestigious and expensive pretty-parlor in Suzail. The shops staff and proprietors scoffed at masked dancers from less reputable establishments in the city.
In the , Lord Arclath Delcastle sponsored Amarune Whitewaves fellow masked dancers from the Dragonriders Club to be primped at the Gilded Feather at great expense, despite the pretty-parlors sneering attitude towards these common dancers.
