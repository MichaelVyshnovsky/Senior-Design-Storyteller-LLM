The '''Gilded Feather''' was a pretty-parlor, or beauty salon, located in [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The Gilded Feather stood on Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], two city blocks west of [[Castle Obarskyr]] with [[Danain's]] hardware store and the [[Witch-Duke's Bride]] as its neighbors to the east. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Gilded Feather was the most prestigious and expensive pretty-parlor in Suzail. The shop's staff and proprietors scoffed at masked dancers from less reputable establishments in the city.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Lord [[Arclath Delcastle]] sponsored [[Amarune Whitewave]]'s fellow masked dancers from the [[Dragonriders Club]] to be primped at the Gilded Feather at great expense, despite the pretty-parlor's sneering attitude towards these common dancers.
