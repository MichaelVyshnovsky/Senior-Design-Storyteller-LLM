        "mainbody": "The '''Dancer's Blushing Mask''' was a popular festhall located within the fortified city of [[Yeshpek]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Part of the festhall was located underground.",
        "Activities": "Though quiet by day, the Dancer's Blushing Mask was a roaring spot and local favorite at night. The festhall was expensive with a twelve [[gold]] piece entry fee, though an annual membership could be had for thirty gold and included a personal wardrobe closet.",
        "Inhabitants": "The festhall was staffed by comely women who wore masks to conceal their identities. One amorous patron once torn the mask off of a waitress only to discover a second mask was painted on her skin. Patrons of the Mask were encouraged to dress up and masquerade as someone else within the festhall. This was accomplished with simple costumes, or [[wizard]]s were permitted to charge fees for casting convincing [[illusion]]s.\n\nThe festhall was owned by [[Illythe Haudamar]]."
