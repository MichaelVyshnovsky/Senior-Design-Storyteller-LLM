        "mainbody": "he Listening Tree was an ancient massive oak tree in Elventree that was pruned so the leaves and branches acted like an amphitheater with perfect acoustics.\nThe tree stood in the exact center of Elventree around 1367 DR. Thousands of suspended globes enchanted with continual light illuminated the tree.\nAn audience used the branches of the tree for seating for performances staged on a large branch three-quarters of the way up the tree. Meetings of significant importance to the community were held here as well."
