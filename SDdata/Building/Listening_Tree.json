        "mainbody": "The '''Listening Tree''' was an ancient massive [[oak]] tree in [[Elventree]] that was pruned so the leaves and branches acted like an amphitheater with perfect acoustics.",
        "Description": "The tree stood in the exact center of Elventree around [[1367 DR]]. Thousands of suspended globes enchanted with ''[[continual light]]'' illuminated the tree.",
        "Activities": "An audience used the branches of the tree for seating for performances staged on a large branch three-quarters of the way up the tree. Meetings of significant importance to the community were held here as well."
