The '''Sleeping Giant''' was a rundown tap house in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The building was located at the end of the main street to the east of Phandalin, which ended in [[Tresendar Manor]]. and by its porch, which had several empty [[barrel]]s of [[ale]] on display.

===Atmosphere===
The Sleeping Giant was owned by a surly dwarf named [[Grista Kettlecopp]], whose rude demeanor reflected the quality (or lack thereof) of the pub itself. It was the favored watering hole for cruder folk, and catered mostly to [[dwarf]] and [[human]] miners and ruffians.  The bar was filthy and poorly maintained, and townsfolk were known to dissuade visitors from going there.

==History==
When the [[Redbrand]]s occupied Phandalin in [[1491 DR]], they often visited the Sleeping Giant and loitered outside, accosting passersby.{{Phandelver-time}}

The state of the tap house continued to deteriorate in the coming years, and by [[1496 DR]], the paint on the sign had completely worn away.{{AI-time}}
