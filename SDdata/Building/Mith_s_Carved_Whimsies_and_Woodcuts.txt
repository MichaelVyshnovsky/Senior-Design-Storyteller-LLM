'''Mith's Carved Whimsies and Woodcuts''' was a specialty woodshop in [[Sundabar]] that belonged to the extremely skilled, though somewhat child-like, woodcarver [[Mith Tlalant]]. 

==Services==
Mith reveled in delighting the children with small, wooden carvings of animals, monsters and even personalities of [[Faer√ªn]]. 

==Repuitation==
Despite their innocent nature, Mith's hand-size crafts were popular enough to be found in far away lands such as [[Kara-Tur]] and [[Maztica]]. They sold for a fairly steep price of 700 [[gold piece]]s, but foreign collectors were willing to repurchase them for thousands of gold pieces.
