The right side of the temple had one service entrance guarded and locked by a [[Tooth of Torm|''tooth of Torm'']]. Upon officially entering the temple through the guardpost, three paths existed along the entry hall: two diagonal paths of left and right gates with a central path to the offeratorium. The central path passed by the walls of two rooms: the repair workshop on the left and the storage sacristy on the right. In the back of the temple, passed the offeratorium and the sanctum, was the High Holy Hall where the incarnation of Torm once resided during the [[Time of Troubles]].",
