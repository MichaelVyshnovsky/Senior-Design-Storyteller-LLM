Anabravvurs was the best and most luxurious shipwright workshop in the Sea of Fallen Stars, based in Selgaunt of Sembia in 1490s DR.
By the late 15 century DR, Anabravvurs shipbuilders were run by Alpharra Anabravvur, the third generation of her family to helm the business. Alpharras ships were huge and luxurious, elegantly designed out of superb materials. Anabravvurs received a lot of business but could afford to spend time on building, unaffected financially by the loss of one or more clients.
