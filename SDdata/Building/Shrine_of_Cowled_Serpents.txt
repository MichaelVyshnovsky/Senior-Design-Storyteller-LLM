The Shrine of Cowled Serpents was hidden temple dedicated to Sseth, the World Serpent, found in the Forest of Wyrms.
The temple was located underground beneath the western edge of the forest.
The temple was destroyed by human mages long ago.
Since its destruction, the temple was home to a variety of snakes. The Coiled Cabal explored the ruins in search of the legendary Naja Fountain.
