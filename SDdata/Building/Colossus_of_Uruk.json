        "mainbody": "he Colossus of Uruk was a gigantic granite statue found on the northern tip of the island of Sahu in the Ruined Kingdoms of east Zakhara in the early 1400s DR.\nThe Colossus stood atop a high plateau overlooking the Horn of Sahu and the Crowded Sea. The statue stood  tall. In 1367 DR, the statue was overgrown with vegetation and birds nests.\nThe inside of the statue was hollow and contained numerous chambers including a small library. The walls within the head of the statue were lined with gold to further enhance the light output.\nThe main light source for the Colossus was actually a massive imprisoned fire elemental.\nThe Colossus was initially erected by the Necromancer Kings to serve as a lighthouse for the island to protect incoming ships from the dangerous reefs. The eyes in the head of the statue used to contain magical lenses that would augment light.\nIn 1367 DR, the philosopher Kazerabet used the library to further her research."
