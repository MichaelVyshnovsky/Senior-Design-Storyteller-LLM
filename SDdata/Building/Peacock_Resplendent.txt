It was located on Ransars Ride near the border between the second and third quarters of the city. The Palace of Many Spires was also located nearby.
It was a sprawling complex.
It included rooms that could be used for private gatherings and feasts. One of these rooms was huge and had about a hundred candelabra in it.
Senators and elite of Innarlith often liked to use this inn for gatherings.
A number of senators met here in 1364 DR after the funeral for Senator Khonsu. At the meeting they made plans to make Willem Korvan, Khonsus assassin, into a new senator for the city-state.
