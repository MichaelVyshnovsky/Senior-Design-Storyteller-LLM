        "mainbody": "The '''Last Light Inn''' was a tavern located in [[Reithwin]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It served as the secret base of the [[Selûnite]] resistance by the innkeeper [[Halfred]] to oppose [[Ketheric Thorm]], until the general's fall. It remained abandoned for a century until [[Isobel Thorm]] used it to hide from Ketheric, later attracting the attention of the [[Harpers]].",
        "Geography": "[[File:Last Light Inn docks.jpg|thumb|''The Last Light Inn's docks on the [[River Chionthar]].'']]\nThe tavern was located just outside the town, beside the [[River Chionthar]]. Two bridges across the water allowed access to the Last Light, though since the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|shadow curse]], only the southeast bridge was usable. A small burial ground lay to the northeast, as well as a small house.",
        "Structure": "[[File:Last Light Inn interior.jpg|thumb|''The Last Light Inn's taproom.'']]\nThe inn was a two-story building; the ground floor was the taproom featuring the bar and a large number of tables curtained-off into booths by various tapestries, as well as a couple of rooms for guests. On the second floor, there extra rooms and a balcony overlooking the River Chionthar. The basement was smaller, and was mainly used for storage. It did, however, have a secret exit that led to a small enclave and house just outside. The basement was primarily used by Halfred to help organize the Selûnite resistance.  \n\nIn addition, the Inn housed a dock from the Chionthar, allowing small boats to dock underneath. Outside of the main building itself, a small forge allowed those versed in blacksmithing to craft weapons and armor.",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} Century": "Around [[1373 DR]],{{Thorm-time}} the then owner of the inn, Halfred, secretly met and organized with those loyal to [[Selûne]] to oppose Ketheric Thorm and his Dark Justiciars. On his death, Ketheric laid a shadow curse on the land, forcing Reithwin and the Last Light Inn to be abandoned for around a hundred years.",
            "15{{th}} century": "After being resurrected by [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]] in the late 1400s DR, Ketheric's daughter Isobel, horrified with her father's change, fled to the abandoned Last Light Inn there. There, she cast a spell that enveloped the building and a small portion of the surrounding area in Selûne's grace, protecting it from the shadow-curse. This created a safe haven for those seeking shelter, for so long as Isobel herself remained alive.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, agents of the [[Harpers]] and [[Flaming Fist]] headed by [[Jaheira]] came to Reithwin to investigate Ketheric's own return from the dead. Jaheira and Isobel became acquainted and Isobel gifted the groups with a blessing of Selûne providing a limited protection from the shadow curse when outside the inn, as Isobel herself needed to stay at the Last Light to maintain concentration on the moon shield. Soon thereafter, a [[Absolute adversaries|group of adventurers]] came to the location seeking protection from the shadow-curse, and met Jaheira and her Harpers, who directed them to Isobel."
