The Tower of the Dawn was an important religious site for the great fortress of Sarahin.
The Tower of Martyrs was located deep within the Haunted Lands of Zakhara in Sarahin.
A sacred flame, called the Lamp of Devotion, was tended so it burned bright at all hours.
Holy slayers of the Everlasting used this location for many purposes. The call to prayer was issued here every morning, noon, and evening. New holy slayers were inducted into the Everlasting here after taking their vow of secrecy. The Tower also served as a site to punish criminals where they were branded, hanged, or thrown from the top of the tower, depending on their crimes.
