The '''Shrine of the Undying Heart''' was devoted to the worship of [[Karsus]], the Momentary God.

==Location==
The shrine was located atop a red stone butte on the [[Star Mounts]] within the [[Dire Wood]].

==Structure==
Originally constructed by residents of [[Karse]], the Shrine of the Undying Heart was made from pink [[marble]] that was stained deep crimson. The temple's main circle was supported by 36 pillars, each measuring {{SI|10|ft}} in diameter. The main circle had a radius of {{SI|100|ft}}. The circle's roof was a dome cut from a single piece of rock.

The temple was surrounded by outlying buildings during ages past, but had long since disappeared as of [[1367 DR]].

==Interior==
A statue depicting a lifelike [[human]] heart was found at the center of the temple, beating in tune with Karsus' heart while he was alive. A sheen of continuously swirling blood covered the beating statue. The [[Heartblood River]] derived its name from the fact that the blood from the statue eventually flowed down the butte to mingle with the river.

==Defenses==
A [[stone golem]] resembling Karsus, and made from a piece of his essence, guarded the interior of the temple.

==Rumors & Legends==
The red stone upon which the shrine rested was believed to have been part of Karsus' mortal form.
