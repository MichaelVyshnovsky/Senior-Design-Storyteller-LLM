Old Winding Road Maps and Charts was a dusty shop in the city of Waterdeep, in the late 14 century DR, that was operated by the elderly Thorauntur Szalmast.
This business stood along the High Road, in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
As its name implied, the Old Winding Road sold both maps and nautical charts.
Following the death of Thorauntur, creditors looted the Old Winding Road.
