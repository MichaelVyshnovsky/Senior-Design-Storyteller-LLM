It was run by the skilled and joyful tailors of the Firelust family, and remained under their proprietorship for generations.\nThe shop was located in the center of the city, just west of the Fishyard marketplace.\nThe Firelust family offered the finest tailoring work that was worth every coin of their rather steep prices. They were so adroit and worked with such collaboration that they could often compose an outfit and dress for a customer where they stood, in a matter of minutes."
