The '''Wayward House''' was a popular, yet down-to-earth inn found in the [[Northbank]] of [[Silverymoon]]. It was located on the northwest corner of the city block where [[Bowshot Ride]] met [[Ghostwalk (street)|Ghostwalk]].

==Services==
The fine inn was well-suited for those who wished to maintain a low profile within the city.

==History==
The Wayward House had the distinction of being built upon the ruins of another establishment called the [[Inn of Wayward Sages]], that burned down sometime between the years [[1366 DR|1366]] and [[1372 DR]]. The newer establishment enjoyed a much better reputation than its predecessor.
