The Variators Intelligentsia was a famed magic school in Eileanar that taught the field of variation.
The college taught the subjects of variation magic, with a specialization in the creation of powerful magical items. At the highest levels of learning, students could even learn the principles and techniques behind the creation of mythallars. The Dean of Teachers Arrias oversaw a staff of incredibly skilled variators, including the elementalists Darius and Carvajal, the transmuter Scribani, the mind-manipulator Heritier, and the elemental summoner and controller Heroicus.
