The '''Variator's Intelligentsia''' was a famed magic school in [[Eileanar]] that taught the field of [[variation]].

==Services==
The college taught the subjects of variation magic, with a specialization in the creation of powerful [[magical item]]s. At the highest levels of learning, students could even learn the principles and techniques behind the creation of ''[[mythallar]]s''. The Dean of Teachers [[Arrias]] oversaw a staff of incredibly skilled variators, including the elementalists [[Darius]] and [[Carvajal]], the transmuter [[Scribani]], the mind-manipulator [[Heritier]], and the [[elemental]] summoner and controller [[Heroicus]].
