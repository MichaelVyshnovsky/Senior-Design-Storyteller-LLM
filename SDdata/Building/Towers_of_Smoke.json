        "mainbody": "he Towers of Smoke was a Raumathari ruin found within the North Country of Rashemen near the Icerim Mountains.\nThe Towers derived their name from the plumes of smoke that constantly leaked from their tops. The smoke was quite harmless to anyone foolish enough to approach too closely. The nearby villages gave the Towers of Smoke a wide berth.\nThe Towers were believed to be guarded by a band of iron golems of various shapes and sizes."
