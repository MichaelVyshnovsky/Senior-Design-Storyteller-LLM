        "Location": {
            "Atmosphere": "The town of Mossbridges was a relatively sleepy place, making the Golden Goblet Inn feel slightly out of place due to its festive appearance and bustling, lively atmosphere."
        },
        "Services": "The Goblet had nothing unique on offer. It had rental lodgings priced at a single [[gold]] piece per night in a shared or private room for two gold pieces.

Alcohol included [[ale]] for a single [[silver]] per pitcher, [[mead]] – five silvers, [[beer]] – five [[copper]] pieces, and table [[wine]] – two silvers. Premium drinks included [[elf|elven]] mead or [[dwarf|dwarven]] spirits for a single [[gold]], and exotic [[Thay]]an [[bloodwine]] for five gold pieces. The inn also offered [[juice]] for one silver.{{Cite organized play/LC/The Good, the Undead, and the Ugly|11}}\n\nFood menu consisted of single-dish meals: a platter of [[roast beast]] with [[potato]]es for two gold coins, [[roast pork]] with roasted vegetables for three gold, [[fried chicken]] garnished with sliced [[apple]]s for two golds, a dish called [[Vegetable Melody]] for five silvers, [[baked flounder]] – one gold, and lastly, the most expensive platter – [[stuffed devil crab]] for five gold. Selection of sweet treats was limited to [[cheese cake]] or [[coffee cake]] sold for a silver, [[bread]] and [[cheese]] platter for one silver, or exotic [[vanilla]]-flavored [[ice cream]] from the famous Resort.",
        "History": "The Golden Goblet Inn sprouted during Mossbridges' prosperous time of growth and expansion that followed [[The Three Women War]] in the [[Vast]] and its alliance with the neighboring metropolis of [[Ravens Bluff]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the inn was run by [[Georgio]], its kindly [[human]] proprietor, who was usually found behind the bar, serving drinks or trading stories at guests' tables. [[Astrala]] was a waitress and hostess who worked for Georgio during that time. The petite [[bard]] named [[Shelaya]] entertained the inn's guests with a wide variety of songs and tales."
