        "mainbody": "The Golden Goblet Inn was a lively and festive tavern and inn in the town of Mossbridges, established in the late 14 century DR.\nThe inn stood on the main street in Mossbridges. Its main entrance was easily noticeable thanks to a sign depicting a goblet hanging over the inns door.\nThe town of Mossbridges was a relatively sleepy place, making the Golden Goblet Inn feel slightly out of place due to its festive appearance and bustling, lively atmosphere.\nThe Goblet had nothing unique on offer. It had rental lodgings priced at a single gold piece per night in a shared or private room for two gold pieces. Private room guests were offered complementary morningfeast. The food and drink available were humble but cheap. Alcohol included ale for a single silver per pitcher, mead – five silvers, beer – five copper pieces, and table wine – two silvers. Premium drinks included elven mead or dwarven spirits for a single gold, and exotic Thayan bloodwine for five gold pieces. The inn also offered juice for one silver.\nFood menu consisted of single-dish meals a platter of roast beast with potatoes for two gold coins, roast pork with roasted vegetables for three gold, fried chicken garnished with sliced apples for two golds, a dish called Vegetable Melody for five silvers, baked flounder – one gold, and lastly, the most expensive platter – stuffed devil crab for five gold. Selection of sweet treats was limited to cheese cake or coffee cake sold for a silver, bread and cheese platter for one silver, or exotic vanilla-flavored ice cream from the famous Resort.\nThe Golden Goblet Inn sprouted during Mossbridges prosperous time of growth and expansion that followed The Three Women War in the Vast and its alliance with the neighboring metropolis of Ravens Bluff.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the inn was run by Georgio, its kindly human proprietor, who was usually found behind the bar, serving drinks or trading stories at guests tables. Astrala was a waitress and hostess who worked for Georgio during that time. The petite bard named Shelaya entertained the inns guests with a wide variety of songs and tales."
