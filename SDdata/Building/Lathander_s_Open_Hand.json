        "mainbody": "Cathalandra Dovaer, Mumfrey Mimly\nLathanders Open Hand was a shrine dedicated to the Morninglord Lathander, found in the village of Hap in Battledale. It remained standing throughout the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nThe Open Hand was in fact once a simple barn built from wood and stone.\nA simple chapel with an altar lay in the center of Lathanders shrine. Floating some  to  above the alter was the Blood of Lathander, drops of the gods blood encased in a chunk of amber that dated back centuries before the Era of Upheaval.\nLocated in the rear of the shrine were the simple living quarters of its attending priestess. Set atop a disused hay loft was a single bell, that was rung when local townsfolk needed to be alerted.\nAs of the midâ€“14 century, the shrine was overseen by Mumfrey Mimly, a rather timid priest of the Morninglord. Mimly was later replaced by the forthright and altruistic Dawnmaster Cathalandra Dovaer.\nCirca 1479 DR, Lathanders Open Hand was overseen by Sister Tressa, one of the few Lathanderians that remained in the Dales for a time following the return of Amaunator to the Realms.\nBoth Dawnmaster Dovaer and Sister Tressa provided aid to morally true adventurers in the form of healing."
