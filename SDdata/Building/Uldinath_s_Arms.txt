'''Uldinath's Arms'''Â was a smithy in the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. A longtime staple of Triboar, the shop was in the family's name for generations and known for high quality.

==Services==
Although a swordsmith by trade, Aldenar produced an impressive range of high-quality smithwork of all kinds that were sold in shops found all over [[the North]] and along the [[Sword Coast]]. Their [[eyebolt]]s, [[latch]]es, [[nail]]s, and [[pin]]s supported [[Wainwright's Wagons]] and all Triboar's wainwrights in their success. Though the prices were slightly cheaper than normal, the metal and workmanship were to a higher standard. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, it sold fine weapons that were stamped with the Uldinath family glyph, which meant they typically sold for 25% more than the typical price.

==Location==
It stood atop a hill in the far northeastern side of town, on the east side of the [[Long Road]] opposite [[Foehammer's Forge]]. Foehammer's and Uldinath's maintained a long-standing but friendly rivalry.

==History==
It was founded by [[Aldenar Uldinath]] and was in business by the mid-1360s DR.

By [[1485 DR]], it was run by his great-granddaughter, [[Harriet Uldinath]].
