The Mistkeep was a temple devoted to Leira, the Lady of the Mists, located on Prespur in the Sea of Fallen Stars during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.Faiths & Avatars lists the location as "Prespir" but this is believed to be a typo.
The temple was notable for the "Pillars of Smoke," which were also called "the Pipepillars."
The Mistkeep was the most influential place of Leiran worship throughout Faer√ªn. It was a rarity among the chaotic, rank-ignoring followers of the Lady of the Mists. The temple housed one of the largest collections of magic items on the entire continent. The clergy used the items to subtly influence the world around them. They also crafted masks to sell in order to generate more income for the temple.
Illusionmaster Duldinbold Alarkyn presided over the temple and other priests within.
