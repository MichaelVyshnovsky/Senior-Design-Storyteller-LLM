        "mainbody": "'''Twilight Hall''' was a temple dedicated to [[Cyric]] located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]].",
        "Description": "Twilight Hall was a short structure made from black [[granite]]. The front double doors were made from [[copper]] and Cyric's [[holy symbol]] adorned them.\n\nTombs filled with notable worshipers of Cyric, including Lord [[Chess]] after a special arrangement was made with [[Khelben Arunsun]] in [[Waterdeep]], could be found in the subterranean section beneath the temple.",
        "Defenses": "The entire temple was warded with ''[[protection from magic]]'' and ''[[protection from good]]'' [[spell]]s. [[Arcane magic]] and [[magic item]]s of any kind would not function within Twilight Hall, though [[divine magic]] worked normally. This reflected Cyric's utter hatred of [[Mystra]].",
        "Activities": "Religious services were held twice daily an hour before dawn and an hour after sunset. A special service was held once per week at midnight, and extremely special events were held during solar eclipses.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Fornault Blacksun]] was High Priest of the temple in {{Yearlink|1369}}. He was assisted by 16 acolytes."
