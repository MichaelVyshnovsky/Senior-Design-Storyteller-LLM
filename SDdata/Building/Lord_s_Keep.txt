The Lords Keep was a fortification in the town of Llorkh in the Savage Frontier and the seat of power of the towns Lord.
Shortly before 1357 DR, Lord Phintarn "Redblade" was found dead at the foot of the Lords Keep. Overnight, the mage Geildarr seized the Lords Keep and claimed the throne, naming himself the new Lord and paving the way for a Zhentarim takeover. He remained installed in the Lords Keep through 1370 DR.
