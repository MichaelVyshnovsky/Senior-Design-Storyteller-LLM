'''Ilmater's Cathedral''' was a small temple in [[Bezantur]], the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples", in [[Thay]]. It was dedicated to [[Ilmater]].

==Location==
The temple was located in south-central Bezantur. It was situated alongside the [[Temple of Helm (Bezantur)|Temple of Helm]] and the [[Temple of Sharess (Bezantur)|Temple of Sharess]], and sat opposite the [[Slave market (Bezantur)|slave market]].

==Activities==
The Cathedral had only a small number of [[priest]]s, but they sought to care for Bezantur's [[slave]]s and poorest residents. Their teachings were popular with the city's downtrodden folk as they offered hope that their suffering and oppression would some day be made worthwhile.

==History==
Ilmater had always been popular among the slaves of Thay, which naturally attracted the ire of the [[Red Wizards]]. Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], the only places for Ilmater's worship in the realm were mobile, and members of [[Church of Ilmater|his church]] were often treated as fugitives. As of the late 1360s [[DR]], this small temple had become popular among the poor and enslaved of Bezantur, and naturally the Red Wizards were once again angered and suspicious. They accused the Cathedral of undermining the city's government by smuggling slaves to freedom and by providing free [[magic]]al healing to the victims of officially sanctioned punishments and torture. However, they were unable to prove any of these allegations.
