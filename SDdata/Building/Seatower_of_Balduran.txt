Named after Balduran, the tower could be reached by a bridge from the western shore linking it to the mainland. It was used as a barracks, naval base, dungeon, and fortress.
It had a full armory and catapults to battle hostile ships, and a massive chain which could be stretched from it to the outermost wharf on the east side to bar the harbor to invaders.
