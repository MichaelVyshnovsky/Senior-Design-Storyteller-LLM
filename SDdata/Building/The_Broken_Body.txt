The Broken Body was a labyrinth used by the faithful, and exceptionally brave, of Loviatar to seek the Maiden of Pains guidance during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The maze was secluded in the subterranean levels beneath the Palace of Sweet Pain within the Foreign Quarter of Zhentil Keep.
Hidden traps, pitfalls, and other nefarious items filled the Broken Body, all designed to maim and inflict pain, but not to kill immediately.
A supplicant who reached the mazes objective could ask questions of Loviatar as if she had cast the commune spell.
