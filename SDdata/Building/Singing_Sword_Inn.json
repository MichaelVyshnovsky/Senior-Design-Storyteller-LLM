        "mainbody": "The Singing Sword was a small and charming inn located within the Temple District of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. It was a great retreat for locals and travelers who sought a quiet, and luxurious overnight stay. \nBeneath the inn, on the ground floor, was the Sword Tables Dining Lounge, a restaurant that replaced the Swords stables, which were relocated to nearby abandoned house. Both the inn and restaurant were located on Waelstar Way in the eastern side of the Altarside neighborhood."
