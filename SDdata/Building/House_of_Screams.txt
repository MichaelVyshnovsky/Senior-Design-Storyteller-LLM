The '''House of Screams''' was the nearest thing to a city hall or courthouse in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]]. It was where the city's [[Tribunal (Evernight)|ruling tribunal]] held court.

==Location==
It was located in the "upscale" neighborhood of [[Black Mound]].

==Structure==
The House of Screams was a decrepit, multilevel manor house. It was the oldest and one of the largest such manors in Black Mound, and by extension, in all of Evernight.

==Interior==
The upper level of the manor was used by Evernight's ruling tribunal of powerful [[ghoul]]s&mdash;its closest thing to a government&mdash;to preside over assemblies and moderate disputes. The exits were all reinforced with rusty [[portcullis]]es that were lowered during trials to prevent the guilty party from fleeing their sentence: being eaten by the tribunal.

The cellar of the House of Screams was large and open, and served as a site for residents of Evernight to resolve their disputes without involving the tribunal. In other words, it was an arena where the parties battled to the death. To the extent that these fights had formal rules and procedures, witnesses had to attest that the parties abided by them. Such witnesses often included bored ghouls, [[wight]]s, and [[vampire]]s who loitered in the cellar hoping to watch a fight.
