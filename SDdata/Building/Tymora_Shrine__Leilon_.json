Generally, the Shrine was well stocked with potions of healing, and often carried a few vials of potions of climbing, growth, water breathing, and heroism.\nThe original shrine of Tymora was one of the first major temples in Leilon, and stood in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The Shrine was overseen by Puck Caribdas, who also sold potions out of the temple.\nWhen Leilon was besieged by the Cult of Talos in the Battle of Leilon, acolytes of the temple aided in the defense of the town and the townsfolk took care to protect the Shrine."
