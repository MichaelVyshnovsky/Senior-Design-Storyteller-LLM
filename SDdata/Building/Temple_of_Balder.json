While recognizing the conflict between the map and the text, this page will proceed under the assumption that the text is correct. from the old banks of the Meat lake.\nThe Temple of Balder consisted in two concentric rings of dirt, twenty feet tall, with thirty feet of span in the middle. The outer ring was broken by three gaps the inner ring was broken by only one, aligned with the middle gap in the outer ring. Crossing the inner ring led towards a courtyard where two tall great stones flanked the path, themselves part of a ring of 24 stones. Inside that ring, lay a smaller ring of 50 stones, which surrounded a circular slab of multi-hued stone, backed by a wall of similar stone, 15 feet tall. The wall was carved in a twisted lattice work. In the platform there was a 10-foot-tall marble column with a carved surface. Behind the shrine stood a ring of 13 stones,  tall,  wide, and  thick, forming an irregular circle around a stone tablet of polished black rock rising 5 feet from the ground.\nThe inner ring of stones was enchanted, and anyone who was affected would cast out any wooden objects before entering it.\nThe Norns would appear before those who stood before the semicircular wall, with their backs to the column. For those who answered their three questions, they would explain how to break the wards on the Star of Melos-Pelar.\nInside the innermost ring, an apparition of the god Balder would offer people the opportunity to weep for him. Those who did would receive a jewel that would ward against the Eyes of Hathor in the Temple of Ra."
