The Vault of Ages was an underground structure in Myth Drannor used as storage for highly valuable objects.
The Vault was somewhere under Myth Drannor.
When Elminster was transported to the Vault, the first room he was in was cool and damp, made of stone, with vaulted ceilings and luminous crystals set into the spaces where the stone ribs met. There were four winding passages leading out of the room, and they were extremely cluttered with wealth of many kinds. The walls were covered with chests stacked six high the passages had only a small path in their center available for walking.
At least one corridor was made from a deep-worms bones.
The Srinshee kept watch over the Vault.
In , Elminster was held in the Vault of Ages, where the Srinshee kept watch over him. The Coronal, Eltargrim Irithyl, had challenged him to take one thing alone from the Vault within a month, and if it were the wrong thing, hed be slain. The Srinshee knocked him out to try and search his mind for anything he may be hiding, but was unsuccessful. At the end of the month, he asked to take his friendship with the Srinshee from the vault the Coronal was satisfied with his answer.
The Vault of Ages took its name from its watcher, the Srinshee, who was easily amongst the oldest elves of Cormanthor.
