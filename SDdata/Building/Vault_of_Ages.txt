The '''Vault of Ages''' was an underground structure in [[Myth Drannor]] used as storage for highly valuable objects.
{{quote|Beneath the fair city of Cormanthor, in some hidden place, lies the '''Vault of Ages''', sacred storehouse of the lore of our People. 'Let [[Mythal]] rise and [[Myth Drannor]] fall,' says one ballad, 'and still the Vault remembreth all.' Some say the Vault lies there yet, unplundered and as splendid as before, though few now know the way to it. Some say 'tis the [[Srinshee]]'s tomb. Some say she has become a terrible mad thing of clawing magics, and has made the Vault her lair. And there are even some who admit that they do not know.|[[Shalheira Talandren]], High Elven Bard of [[Summerstar]], from [[Silver Blades and Summer Nights: An Informal but True History of Cormanthor]], published in the {{yearlinkName|1355}}}}
==Location==
The Vault was somewhere under [[Myth Drannor]].

==Interior==
When Elminster was transported to the Vault, the first room he was in was cool and damp, made of stone, with vaulted ceilings and luminous crystals set into the spaces where the stone ribs met. There were four winding passages leading out of the room, and they were extremely cluttered with wealth of many kinds. The walls were covered with chests stacked six high; the passages had only a small path in their center available for walking.

At least one corridor was made from a [[deep-worm]]'s bones.

==Defenses==
The [[Srinshee]] kept watch over the Vault.

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Elminster]] was held in the Vault of Ages, where the Srinshee kept watch over him. The [[Coronal]], [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], had challenged him to take one thing alone from the Vault within a month, and if it were the wrong thing, he'd be slain. The Srinshee knocked him out to try and search his mind for anything he may be hiding, but was unsuccessful. At the end of the month, he asked to take his friendship with the Srinshee from the vault; the Coronal was satisfied with his answer.

==Rumors & Legends==
The Vault of Ages took its name from its watcher, the Srinshee, who was easily amongst the oldest elves of [[Cormanthor]].
