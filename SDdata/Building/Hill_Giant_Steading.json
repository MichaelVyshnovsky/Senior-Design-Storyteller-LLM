        "mainbody": "The '''Hill Giant Steading''' was a small fortified settlement located in the [[Moonsea]] region in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Steading was a walled giant community built to the north of the city of [[Phlan]] and south of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]], along the western shores of the [[Stojanow]] river. The [[Dragon's Aerie]], controlled by the dreaded [[Cult of the Dragon]] was located in the mountains to the north of the Hill Giant Steading.",
        "Interior": "The crude interior of the fortress consisted of numerous barracks and halls, including a training hall that offered free services to the members of the giant army. The Steading had one drinking establishment called the [[Twisted Horn Tavern]].",
        "Defenses": "The fortified encampment was home of malicious [[human]] and [[demihuman]] mercenaries, including more fearsome creatures such as [[ettin]]s, [[cloud giant]]s, [[hill giant]]s, [[medusa]]s, and tamed [[carrion crawler]]s, [[displacer beast]]s, and [[neo-otyugh]]s. [[Ogre]]s, [[oni mage]]s, and [[iron golem]]s were used as the fort's guards. The Steading's treasure room was guarded by a [[red dragon|red]] and [[white dragon]]s, while the throne room of the shaman leader was guarded by a white and a [[black dragon]].",
        "History": "[[File:Hill giant pod.png|thumb|''One of the hill giant guards of the Steading.''|225x225px]]\nThe Hill Giant Steading fort was used as a recruitment camp for those following the evil deity [[Bane]], or another powerful being using his name in the 14{{th}} century DR. The Banites accumulated mercenary forces of humans, demihumans, and giants of the Moonsea. The efforts were helmed by a hill giant [[shaman]] devotee of the Lord of Tyranny. Despite the shaman's best efforts, such a collection of unruly creatures resulted in many brawls and conflicts. The infamous [[Fire Knives]] established a cell within the fort and were recruited by the leader of Steading's [[fire gaint]]s to assassinate the shaman leader of the hill giants in order to take control of Bane's army.\n\nAfter the cities of the Moonsea were transported away from [[Tori]] by a band of powerful beings, the heroes of Phlan infiltrated the Steading in order to shake and cripple Bane's hold on the region. They encountered a spy named [[Kardal]] in the fortress who informed the adventurers that in order to get close to the army's leader, the hill giant shaman, they had to assassinate a band of antagonizing cloud giants who were among many factions battling for power within the Steading."
