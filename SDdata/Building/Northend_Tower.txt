The '''Northend Tower''' was a fortification located in [[Scardale Town]], used by the criminal [[Aldavius Darkhand]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Darkhand defended his tower with a number of thugs and hired swordhands. It was rumored to be filled with a small horde of ill-gotten goods collected by the bandit-merchant.
