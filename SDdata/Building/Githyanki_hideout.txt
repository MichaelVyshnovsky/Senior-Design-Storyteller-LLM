'''Githyanki hideout''' was a house in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

==Location==
The hideout was located in the [[Merchant Quarter]] in [[Neverwinter]], near the [[Smuggler's warehouse]].

==Structure==
The hideout was built from wood.

==Interior==
The hideout had many rooms and halls, where the githyanki resided.

==History==
Once the [[Kalach-Cha]] defeated the Luskanites at the Sea Ghost, [[Brelaina]] tasked him/her to get into the hideout, since they couldn't allow assassins to roam Neverwinter. Inside, the Kalach-Cha slayed many githyanki. In one room, a construct appeared and killed some githyanki, then attacked the Kalach-Cha. Once the construct was badly damaged, it retreated back to the portal.
