'''Ahghairon's Tower''' was the home and eventually the final resting place of [[Ahghairon]], the first [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
Ahghairon's Tower was located in a courtyard at the intersection of the [[Street of Silks]] and [[Waterdeep Way]] in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep]].

==Defenses==
A series of six barriers were put in place to prevent entry into the tower. To successfully gain entry to the tower, all wards required keys. Opening each barrier gave a limited amount of time to open the next, as each would reactivate after a short time.

==History==
According to song, Ahghairon slew five [[demon]]s and closed a demonic [[portal]] during the [[Goreclipse]]. The tower was then constructed on the site of the portal.

Upon his death in the {{YearlinkName|1256}}, the tower became his tomb. His nine apprentices warded the entire tower to prevent intruders from disturbing the first Open Lord's final resting place.

Only fifteen years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1271}}, [[Melkar|Melkar of Mirabar]] attempted to breach the tower's defenses. Thereafter, his skeleton hung outside of the tower as a warning to others who would try to breach the tower.

In the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, [[Khondar Naomal]] was nearly able to reach the inside of the tower, but was thwarted by the new [[Blackstaff]], [[Vajra Safahr]], and her allies.
