Griffonwatch Keep was a fortification in the town of Hulburg on the Moonsea in the 15 century DR.
The castled glowered over the town of Hulburg, a mile from the harbor, perched atop a rocky spur of the eastern ridge.
The keep took advantage of the geology of Hulburg and used cliffs on three sides as walls. There was a large curtain wall in front of the keep with a causeway leading to the entrance of the complex.
It was the home of the ruling Hulmaster family beginning sometime in the late 14 century DR. In the late 15 century DR, it was also used for the training and barracks of the Shieldsworn and a place of refuge when the town was in danger of attack. While it was not very well situated to guard the city against attacks by sea, it faced north, inland, serving as a defense against the savage orcs, ogres, and other monsters who dwelt in the desolate hills and moorlands of Thar.
The Hulmaster family originally called home a smallish and drab castle called Hullmaster Keep, also known as Daggergard, until sometime after the , when Griffonwatch was built by Angar Hulmaster.
In the , Sergen Hulmaster&mdasha Hulmaster by adoption, rather than blood&mdashsummoned a small army of wights and similar undead to the castle, hoping to kill his family and blame their deaths on Aesperus, the King in Copper, so that he could become lord of the town. His plan failed, however, as the Hulmasters all escaped, thanks in large part to Geran Hulmaster, Hamil Alderheart, and Sarth Khul Riizar, who battled first the undead and then the House Veruna guards hired by Sergen to contain them within the castle.
