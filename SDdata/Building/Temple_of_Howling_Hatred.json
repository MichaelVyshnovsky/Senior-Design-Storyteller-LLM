        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Howling Hatred''' was an underground temple-complex established by the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was built within a quarter of [[Tyar-Besil]], a ruined [[dwarven]] city that once served as the capital of ancient [[Besilmer]].",
        "Location": "It was situated in the southwest section of the ruined city, within a vast cavern deep beneath the [[Sumber Hills]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. It was accessible by means of a precarious, miles-long staircase that descended deep beneath the hills' Knifepoint Gully.",
        "Interior": {
            "Temple of Elemental Air": "Within the plaza was the pyramidal structure referred to by the cult members as the Temple of Elemental Air. Within the ground hall on the bottom floor was a deep pit of an unusual nature. A howling gust of wind continuously roared through the pit, lifting anyone or anything high above, to the [[Howling Caves]].\n\nThe second floor of the temple held the throne room of [[Torhild Flametongue]], the former King of  Besilmer. In front of a grand throne was a large engraved map that detailed the entire dwarven kingdom. The chamber was appropriated as her own by [[Aerisi Kalinoth]], the fakeâ€“[[avariel]] prophet of the Howling Hatred."
