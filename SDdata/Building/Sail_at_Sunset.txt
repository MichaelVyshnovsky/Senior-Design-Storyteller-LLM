century DR
The Sail at Sunset was a ramshackle dockside tavern in Tulmene of Tethyr, frequented by old salts and rowdy sailors in the late 14 century DR.
The taproom of the Sail at Sunset was quieter than most establishments of similar repute. The main feature of the taproom was a large painting hung over the bar, depicting a beautiful sunset and a storm-battered ship entering the harbor.
The tavern was known for its serversâ€”a surprisingly unattractive, warty bunch of farm lasses with tough bodies, more muscular than most warriors. These women were specifically hired for their looks by Kralbert Dightmaer, who ran the establishment in the late 14 century DR, to avoid harassment of his employees by rowdy sailors.
The tavern was seldomly cleaned, and when it was cleaned it was by pushing drunkards across the floors and out of the door.
Not surprisingly, bar fights were a regular occurrence, but they were always broken apart by a hose of saltwater pumped through from behind the tavern. The presence of three giant, muscled, thuggish bouncers armed with clubs and whips helped to persuade others against starting trouble. Smacking a troublemaker with a chair was another convincing argument.
No bard or minstrel performers ever showed up at the Sail at Sunset however, hired table-dancers entertained the clientele after sundown.
The Sails beers were watered down, and the only food on the menu were biscuits, fried in butter. Occasionally, the tavern offered salted eels or squid when the proprietor was able to purchase a barrel-full for cheap. Each salted fish was sold as-is for two coppers "per corpse," as Kralbert Dightmaer referred to the grub.
