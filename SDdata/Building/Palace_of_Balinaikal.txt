The Palace of Balinaikal was a huge stone structure located deep in the swamp lands of the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur. It was described as dark and sinking. It was named for and ruled over by a mighty ogre mage, Balinaikal, around 1357 DR. He killed or enslaved all who dared to trespass on his domain.
Several esteemed local shamans believed that somewhere within the Palace of Balinaikal lay the skull of Mezin, the first high king of the Issacortae.
