The '''Palace of Balinaikal''' was a huge stone structure located deep in the swamp lands of the [[Northern Wastes]] of [[Kara-Tur]]. It was described as dark and sinking. It was named for and ruled over by a mighty [[ogre mage]], [[Balinaikal]], around [[1357 DR]]. He killed or enslaved all who dared to trespass on his domain.

Several esteemed local shamans believed that somewhere within the Palace of Balinaikal lay the [[Mezin's skull|skull]] of [[Mezin]], the first high king of the [[Issacortae]].
