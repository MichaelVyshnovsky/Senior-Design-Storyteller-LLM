'''Deaders Market''' was a small marketplace in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]].

{{Quote|The flesh is fresh in Deaders Market!|Evernight denizens}}

==Location==
It was located just outside of Evernight's [[Thayan outpost (Evernight)|Thayan Enclave]].

==Services==
The market comprised a handful of [[undead]] merchants' stalls and was known for selling fresh flesh as well as a ghoulish [[alcohol]]ic concoction that was said to sometimes cause fatal hallucinations in mortal imbibers. Despite the risks and the horrid taste, adventurous mortals were known to seek it out.
