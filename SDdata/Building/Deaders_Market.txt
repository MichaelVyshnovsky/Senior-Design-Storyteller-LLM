Deaders Market was a small marketplace in the Shadowfell city of Evernight.
It was located just outside of Evernights Thayan Enclave.
The market comprised a handful of undead merchants stalls and was known for selling fresh flesh as well as a ghoulish alcoholic concoction that was said to sometimes cause fatal hallucinations in mortal imbibers. Despite the risks and the horrid taste, adventurous mortals were known to seek it out.
