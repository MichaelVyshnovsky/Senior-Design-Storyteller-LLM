        "Location": "Wynn Castle was located east of the [[Clear Whirl River]], south of where its tributary, the [[Wyrm River]], joined it. Its location permitted it to serve as a defensive point for the southern passes that led to the rest of the civilized regions of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Structure": "The castle was the second-strongest castle in Hartsvale; only [[Castle Hartwick]] was better fortified. It was circled by a moat and had two curtain walls surrounding and inner keep. This inner keep (Wynn Keep) had four towers at its corners, which rose higher than the inner curtain wall, The towers were named and included the red tower, the flag tower, and the queen's tower.",
        "History": "[[File:The Titan of Twilight.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Lanaxis]] rips a tower from Wynn Castle, from the cover of the novel ''[[The Titan of Twilight]]''.'']]\nThroughout its history, Wynn Castle had withstood attacks from [[fire giant]]s.\n\nAfter the battle with [[fire giant]]s in the [[Gorge of the Silver Wyrm]] in [[1369 DR]], Queen [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]], [[Kaedlaw Burdun|her newborn child]], [[Avner]], [[Tavis Burdun]], and [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] retreated to this castle. The castle quickly fell under siege from an alliance of [[giant-kin]], including [[firbolg]]s, [[verbeeg]]s, and even [[fomorian]]s.\n\nDuring the siege, the [[Twilight Spirit]] himself appeared, arriving in the form of a [[roc]] of shadow at night."
