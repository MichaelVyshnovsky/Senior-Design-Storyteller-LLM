        "mainbody": "The Think Easy was a social club attached to the Gehirn Cibus restaurant deep in the Underdark, owned and operated by the mind flayer entrepreneur Brikhalna \"Dutch\" Ipprszhen.\nThe Think Easy served as a select club for Dutchs friends, business partners, and other trusted associates. Because his social circle was made up of gangsters and crime-lords, he enforced the civility of his patrons by the threat of an elite team of drow assassins. This ensured that the Think Easy was kept a safe neutral ground, and high-stakes business deals could be conducted peacefully at his tables.\nAfter earning great wealth as an independent businessman, Dutch became part-owner of the Gehirn Cibus restaurant, already a famed and popular Underdark location. Later, he opened up the attached Think Easy as a way of expanding his business.\nAside from Dutch himself, prominent clients of the Think Easy included drow matriarch Felyndiira \"Mad Money\" Shinarrvha, the hit man beholder Vikhrumn \"100 Gold\" Coll, the deep gnome fence Gnormahlenvaey \"Squeaky\" Catoneriehn, and the assassin Grayshivnarien \"the Fiddler\" Taliain.\nNaturally, law-enforcement types like Sir Elliot of Kness were not welcome at Dutchs establishment."
