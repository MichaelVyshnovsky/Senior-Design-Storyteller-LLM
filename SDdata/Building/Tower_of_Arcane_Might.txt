The Tower of Arcane Might, also known as the Cloaks Tower, was the guildhall of the Brotherhood of the Cloak, the spellcasters organization that regulated and oversaw the use of magic within the city of Mulmaster.
It was located in the northwestern part of Mulmaster, in one of the citys more affluent boroughs.
The grounds surrounding the tower-complex also housed a number of small buildings, all of which were encircled by a high-set wall.
On either side of the towers massive iron doors were two statues that turned their heads to watch those entering within.
The tower complex held a number chambers that accommodated the needs of the citys mages and other spellcasters, such as living quarters, vast libraries, scriptorium, areas for arcane research, and secured rooms that housed their collection of magic items and accumulated wealth.
Members of the Cloaks were given use of the towers extensive resources. They could often be found researching within the towers vast library or utilizing its laboratories for magical experimentation.
The tower was well-protected by a network of arcane wards that were laid across and within its structure. It boasted a formidable group of defenders, in the form of eight golems, two each of the clay, flesh, iron, and stone varieties.
