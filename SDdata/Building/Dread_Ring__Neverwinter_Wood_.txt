The '''Dread Ring''' in [[Neverwinter Wood]] was a gruesome and terrifying fortress that served as the base of operations for the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] within the [[Sword Coast North]] in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of several [[Dread Ring]]s constructed across [[Faerûn]] under the orders of the [[Thayan]] regent, [[Szass Tam]].

==Location==
The Dread Ring was located east of [[Helm's Hold]] in the densest and darkest southern reaches of Neverwinter Wood where some of the Ring's [[undead]] creatures were sent to haunt. and even stalwart [[adventurer]]s were not immune to the feelings of unease and fear as the residual dark [[magic]] emanating from the site caused their palms to sweat and their teeth to chatter.

The space between the woods and the outer walls of the Dread Ring was a few hundred feet wide in all directions, and everywhere the ground was soaked in blood, covered in ash, and littered with the telltale signs of a battlefield: countless tracks, severed limbs, and broken weapons.

==Structure==
The Dread Ring was both a fortress and a [[necromantic]] ritual site and thus the whole structure oozed with palpable [[evil]].

The fortress was roughly circular, As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was also in a half-ruined state, with the stone walls open, pillars broken, spindly towers shattered, and gates left gaping. Rather than find new stone to repair the damage, the Red Wizards opted to patch the walls with corpses. Large portions of the fortress were thus composed of writhing undead masses of flesh, bones, and limbs that would continue to repair themselves and even build more corpse walls if provided bodies, living or dead. Unwary visitors risked being grabbed by the mass of hands and dragged into the wall.

==Interior==
As a structure built and conceived by [[lich]]es, little about the Dread Ring's interior architecture was familiar or comfortable. Many rooms had odd numbers of walls that sloped or intersected at strange angles, many corridors fluctuated wildly in width and made weird turns, and some staircases were uneven and sometimes led to the same floor level from which they started. Any décor did not fit the space it adorned, and alien smells, disorienting lights, and moaning sounds emanated from seams where ill-fitting walls met. In some places, the architecture became supernaturally disorienting, such as stairs that could only be traversed in one direction, corridors that appeared to curve despite going straight (or vice versa), and doors that led to entirely separate places within the Ring.

===Dread Spire===
The tallest tower to survive until the late 15{{th}} century DR, this structure contained many of the people and chambers central to the Thayans' operations, including their war room and one of four entrances to the sanctum. It also housed a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Shadowfell]]&mdash;in a permanently and magically darkened room&mdash;which was used to transport corpses in and out of [[Neverwinter]] and [[Evernight]] as well as to access the so-called "[[Shadowfell Road]]" to [[Surcross]], along which their supply caravans from Thay traveled.

Lastly, the Spire contained the "Chapel of the Dragon", where captives from the [[Cult of the Dragon]] were forced to help the Red Wizards create a [[dracolich]] that would be obedient to the Thayan leaders.

===Excavation Pit===
[[File:Lorragauth bones.jpg|thumb|320px|''The excavation of Lorragauth's bones.'']]
As of the late 1470s DR, the middle of the Ring contained a large pit dug by the Thayans' laborers, some living but most undead. This was the site of an excavation of the skeleton of an extremely ancient and powerful [[black dragon]] known as [[Lorragauth]], the massive bones were slowly being unearthed (starting with the enormous rib cage) in the hopes of raising the monster as a [[dracolich]]. However, this process allowed greater amounts of the dragon's energies to seep out into the ground, causing parts of the pit to become highly [[acid]]ic and/or shrouded in magical darkness. In particular, an area called "Underwing" beneath the excavated left wing came to have strong connections to the Shadowfell.

Hanging precariously along the edge of the pit, and extending down to lean against rocks and mounds of dirt, was a rickety and convoluted scaffold supporting heavy cranes and treacherous walkways. The whole structure creaked loudly under the weight of the workers, and there was a constant risk of getting skewered on splinters or rusty nails.

===Flesh Factory===
[[File:Dread ring 1 NCS.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Some "corpses" in the flesh factory were fresher than others.'']]
Also called the "Death Forge", this massive necromantic laboratory was located between the outer wall and the inner tower, and it was here that most of the Thayans' undead servants were ''[[Animate dead|animated]]''. Necromantic runes adorned the walls, floor, and ceiling, and containers of blood and bile&mdash;ranging in size from flasks to barrels&mdash;sat within easy reach. Two walls of the "factory" were lined with [[iron]] sarcophagi, stone coffins, and tall vats, all fitted with tubes to pump new fluids into whatever was placed inside. Bodies and body parts&mdash;some old and decayed and others so fresh as to be bloody and twitching&mdash;were hung from hooks, heaped in piles, or lay on stone and [[steel]] slabs. Corpses were prepared by treating them with [[alchemical]] concoctions that made the flesh pliable.

This laboratory was designed specifically to ''animate'' corpses faster and more efficiently than through normal necromantic spellcasting. It was staffed by both undead servants and living necromancers, led by [[Jawbone]].

===Observatory===
The uppermost chamber within the Dread Ring was an observatory used by the Red Wizard [[Lurrens]] to chart the skies of [[Toril]], the Shadowfell, and the [[Feywild]] simultaneously, as well as to [[scry]] into all three [[planes]]. This was accomplished by a massive, revolving [[orrery]] as large as a house with hundreds of moving parts attached to dozens of metal limbs tipped with colorful orbs, iron crescents, and delicate [[glass]] lenses. The device was massively complicated and difficult to use or understand.

Guards, both living and undead, were always present to keep the orrery secure.

===Sanctum===
As of the late 1470s DR, the sanctum was used by the leader of operations at the Dread Ring, the lich [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], as her personal library and meditation chamber. The library contained an impressive collection of tomes on the subjects of magic, history, and various esoterica&mdash;all immaculately maintained&mdash;while her meditation chamber appeared at first to be a ruined and filthy bedroom. As a lich, Shadowmantle had no need to sleep and was unbothered by the filth, and so used the room to prepare spells and to house her belongings.

Not only did the sanctum seem to exist in four places at once within the Dread Ring, but the two rooms&mdash;the library and Shadowmantle's chambers&mdash;seemed to be unable to exist at the same time.

==Activities==
In hopes of restoring and enacting the terrible ritual for which the Dread Ring had originally been built, Thayan efforts to build and rebuild the fortress were constant, and made possible thanks to throngs of undead servants.

==Defenses==
Aside from the twisted magic of the Dread Ring itself, the primary defense of the fortress was the countless undead that inhabited it. This included reanimated [[thunderbeast]] bones, specifically the [[totem]] of the [[Thunderbeast tribe]] that the Thayans had pilfered from [[Morgur's Mound]].

==History==
The Dread Ring was built as part of a Red Wizard ritual to seize control of the Sword Coast North and help Szass Tam achieve [[god]]hood. Led by [[Sylora Salm]], the Thayans schemed to awaken [[Maegera]], the [[fire]] [[primordial]] imprisoned within [[Gauntlgrym]] beneath [[Mount Hotenow]], and to use the death and destruction caused by its rampage to empower a Dread Ring similar to ones that had been built in Thay. They succeeded in awakening the primordial and causing the [[Ruining]] of the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, and the Dread Ring was magically raised with the power of the deaths and sacrifices of innocent [[humanoid]]s. The site chosen for the Ring was selected because the land itself seemed to surge with powerful dark magic that was seeping into the world. 

Salm's schemes were ultimately thwarted just before the fortress was complete. In the {{YearlinkName|1462}}, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his allies sealed Maegera, cutting off the Ring from the primordial's power and prompting Szass Tam himself to censure Salm, who was only spared thanks to the scheming intervention of Valindra Shadowmantle. While she attempted to atone for her failure by using the Dread Ring's power to kill more innocents, Salm was slain in the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, after another encounter with Drizzt and company in which she depleted much of the Ring's power. This left the structure in ruins,

Valindra Shadowmantle next took charge of Thayan activities in the Sword Coast North and operated out of the half-ruined Dread Ring. Despite the fact that it was ostensibly broken and unable to be used to enact the foul ritual for which it had been intended, Shadowmantle sought to fix it, and ultimately planned on killing enough people to empower it once more. During the 1470s DR, she sought massive numbers of undead servants to assist in repairs of the fortress. At the same time, Shadowmantle investigated the possibility of using the Dread Ring for other purposes should she fail to fully restore it.  She began researching ways to tap into the power of Maegera that lay trapped within the Dread Ring after it had been absorbed decades earlier, and while investigating the source of the magic in the ground beneath the Ring, she was the first to discover the buried corpse of the dragon Lorragauth. With the unwilling help of several members of the Cult of the Dragon, she sought to use the power of the Dread Ring to transform the dragon into a dracolich under her control, despite the logistical challenges of doing so with a long-dead skeleton.

During this time, the [[Shadovar–Thay War]] was heating up, and the [[Netherese]] forces of Prince [[Clariburnus Tanthul]] and his allies among the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] were constantly harassing the Thayans at the Dread Ring. Their frequent attacks turned the clearing surrounding the fortress into a blasted battlefield, and although they never breached the walls, they succeeded in slowing Shadowmantle's operations. The heavy losses, however, also served to provide more prospective undead laborers for the Thayans while also weakening the relationship between the Gray Wolves and the Netherese.

Although nearly successful, Shadowmantle's plans were thwarted in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. A coalition led by [[Alphonse Knox]] consisting of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] and its allies&mdash;including the Gray Wolf tribe, the [[Icehammer]] dwarves, the [[Harpers]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], and a group of rogue Red Wizards led by [[Rath Modar]]&mdash;attacked and destroyed much of the Dread Ring, including Lorragauth's excavation site, all installations for raising undead and summoning [[fiend]]s, and a giant ''[[sphere of annihilation]]''. This allowed a group of [[adventurers]] known as the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] to use a ''portal'' to infiltrate Shadowmantle's tower in Thay, stop her dracolich ritual, and destroy her body, sending her back to her hidden [[phylactery]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Valindra Shadowmantle's sanctum held the possibility of many important discoveries. Specifically, her library was said to contain invaluable information about how the undead rulers of Thay thought and operated in the 15{{th}} century DR, and her historical tomes were said to contain the locations of many lost ancient sites as well as the dark truths behind many of Thay's deeds and goals.

==Inhabitants==
Much of the Dread Ring's population was made up of undead. The supply of corpses to be raised as undead servants was harvested from battles with the Netherese, as well as collected from [[Uthgardt]] and [[Illefarn]] burial grounds and the crypts beneath [[Castle Never]] and the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]], from where they were transported to the Dread Ring via the Shadowfell.

The Ring's living occupants consisted of the Thayans&mdash;mostly necromancers&mdash;and some of their allies and captives. as well as a number of [[Ashmadai]].

===Notable Inhabitants===
As of 1479 DR, the key players at the Dread Ring included:
* [[Valindra Shadowmantle]], a lich and direct subordinate of Szass Tam who oversaw the Ring and all Thayan operations in the region. 
* [[Jawbone]], a [[half-orc]] necromancer who oversaw the flesh factory.
* [[Kroskas]], an agent of the Cult of the Dragon compelled to assist in raising Lorragauth as a dracolich.
* [[Lurrens]], a [[brain in a jar]] who managed the observatory and alerted Shadowmantle to any interesting developments.
* [[Praddak]], a wight who oversaw the excavation of Lorragauth's skeleton.
