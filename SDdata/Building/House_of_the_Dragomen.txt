The House of the Dragomen was an official building located in the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands.
The structure was located in the northcentral section of the city just southwest of the Raumkreml which was the seat of government in Almorel during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The House of the Dragomen served as a residence of important foreign officials within Almorel. Caravan-masters, provided they were respected enough, were also allowed to stay within the House.
The building was run by a half-elven chamberlain named Sirule Kalishenko.
