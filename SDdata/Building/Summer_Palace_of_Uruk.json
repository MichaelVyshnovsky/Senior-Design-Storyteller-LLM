        "mainbody": "The '''Summer Palace of Uruk''' was a beautiful structure found on the southern tip of the island of [[Sahu]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] of [[east Zakhara]] in the early 1400s [[DR]].{{Ne-time}}",
        "Description": "The Palace was located a hundred miles south of [[Nycopolis]] on a towering plateau that overlooked [[the Rubban's Tears]] and the [[Crowded Sea]]. In stark contrast to the dark volcanic rock of Nycopolis, [[Uruk]] constructed his palace out of pristine [[ivory]] and white [[marble]]. Its courtyards and domed halls gleamed like polished bone.",
        "Defenses": "Uruk's placement of the palace ensured it was nearly unapproachable by conventional means. The southern walls of the palace faced the treacherous rocky outcroppings of the sea. Anyone wishing to approach by ground needed to cross through deep jungle infested with ravenous [[ghoul]]s. Travel to the palace by air was the most direct route, but even then an [[adventurer]] needed to be wary of the [[wyvern]]s that nested in the [[Vishap's Spine]]. Uruk himself traveled to the palace via a hidden ''[[teleportation]]'' chamber found in the bowels of the palace in Nycopolis.\n\nThe palace was protected from [[divination]] spells by special wards.",
        "Inhabitants": "In [[1367 DR]], the only inhabitant of the Palace was the [[necromancer]] [[Kazerabet]] who discovered the abandoned location while flying through the air on a magical steed.",
        "Legends & Rumors": "It was said that Uruk raised his palace in just three days and three nights using a host of immortal laborers, [[tasked genie]]s and other fiends."
