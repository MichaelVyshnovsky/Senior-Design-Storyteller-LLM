The '''Misty Beard''' was a tavern located in the city of [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

==Description==
The exterior sign hanging above the main door depicted a bearded sailor with thick beads of water glistening like a rainbow throughout his beard. The droplets of water in the beard were actually [[enchanted]] to make them sparkle in the light.

The four-story stone building feature large arched windows and downspouts carved to resemble alluring winged maidens.

==Location==
The tavern was found in the eastern section of Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] along the east side of [[Saerdoun Street]] just north of [[Endcliff Tower]] and in between [[Sulmor Street]] and [[Hassantyr's Street]].

==Inhabitants==
Part of what made the Misty Beard famous up and down the [[Sword Coast]] was the staff which was composed of exotic or monstrous creatures from all over [[Faer√ªn]]. Examples included [[lizard men]], [[myconid]]s, [[faerie dragon]]s, and even a few [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s controlled by other members of the staff. Other members of the staff were shapeshifters or used [[illusion]] [[magic]] to alter their appearance, leaving patrons amazed since they never knew what they would see when walking through the front door.

Most of the waiters were usually winged [[sprite]]s hired for a month at a time, after which point they were usually sick of the city and left.

The tavern was owned by a pair of [[half-elven]] sisters named [[Allet Tzuntzin|Allet]] and [[Vindara Tzuntzin]]. The bartender was a fearless lizardman named [[Munzrim Marlpar]]. Munzrim could usually be found talking with a [[spectator]] called [[Thoim Zalamm]].

==Services==
The Misty Beard was famous for its [[garlic butter]] and [[gooseberry]] jam. The fruit used for the same was grown on the owner's farm outside of the city.

==History==
The Misty Beard was first established as a tavern by the name of [[the Cat and Songbird]]. The owners at that time, both members of the thieves guild, perished during an assassination attempt on one of Waterdeep's Lords.
