The '''Temple of Lolth''' in [[Bezantur]] was the center of [[Thayan]] worship of [[Lolth]], the [[Spider]] Queen, in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located near the waterfront in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Temple of Tyr]] and [[Temple of Gond (Bezantur)|Temple of Gond]] to the west, the [[Temple of Bane (Bezantur)|Temple of Bane]] and [[Temple of Kossuth (Bezantur)|Temple of Kossuth]] to the north, and the [[Temple of Juiblex (Bezantur)|Temple of Juiblex]] to the east.

==Structure==
The temple was a grand, black dome adorned with silver spiderwebs. Above the main doorway was a shining inscription in the [[Drow language]] which read: "Lolth tlu malla; jal ultrinnan zhah xundus" (meaning: "Lolth be praised; all victory is her doing").

==Activities==
Services were held at midnight, and were surprisingly popular among the [[human]]s of Bezantur. and wore long black [[robes]] and often adorned themselves with pigments and wigs to appear like drow. A few actual drow were always in attendance as well, and the temple was visited once every few months by a drow [[priestess|High Priestess]] from the [[Underdark]] who served as the leader of the congregation and the overseer of the Temple's logistics.

Whenever the temple's drow High Priestess returned to the Underdark, a handful of the Temple's human worshipers were chosen to go with her. While these individuals were never seen or heard from again, the congregation was fervently convinced that they lived out their days indulging in the splendors of drow culture.

==Inhabitants==
In addition to the human congregation, one or two drow were always in residence at the Temple.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the human congregation was led by a Thayan priestess named [[Rhytella]], while the Temple's true High Priestess was the drow [[Triel Teienna]], although she only visited once every few months.
