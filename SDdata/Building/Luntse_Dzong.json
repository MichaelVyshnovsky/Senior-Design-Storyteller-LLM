        "Structure": "The fortress was built on a rock shelf {{SI|600|ft}} above the floor of the mountain pass, offering splendid views of the surrounding terrain. Luntse Dzong stood three stories high. The upper two stories had windows and wooden balconies. The roofs were wood held down by rocks.",
        "Interior": "The interior of the fortress housed an armory, barracks, storerooms, a hostel for travelers, and a temple for the [[Yellow Mountain Sect]].",

A man named [[Govinda]] was their commander. A toll was collected from every caravan that traveled through the pass in exchange for protection from bandits, and the ability to use the hostel of the fortress."
