        "mainbody": "The Halls of the Iron Ring was a structure on Skull Island in Skullport.\nThe Halls of the Iron Ring was a three-story structure exclusively accessible to members of the Iron Ring and their personal guards. Slaves were seldom brought to this building, and those who did enter never returned. Members of the Iron Ring, along with other slavers operating within Skullport, gathered here periodically to deliberate on matters concerning their trade. Several members maintained offices within the structure, where they stored records and some supplies. A few also maintained sparsely furnished rooms for use when extended stays were required due to business obligations.\nThe structure was also used to receive important visitors associated with Skullportâ€™s slave market. These individuals were afforded generous hospitality by the Iron Ring, which may include temporary accommodations in one of the guest apartments housed within the building. The Iron Ring frequently extended these courtesies to ensure that their business relationships remained favorable during the visitors stay in Skullport.\nThe Halls of the Iron Ring was heavily patrolled by two groups of six guards and the entrance was vigilantly guarded by four guards. \nThe halls of the building were heavily fortified with traps and murder holes, and it was rumored to contain numerous secret doors and hidden chambers."
