        "Operation": "It was owned and run by [[Alukk Dannath]] and his three daughters. His daughters were all [[Harpers]].",
        "Services": "Dannath's Pickles, Nuts, & Foods specialized in providing foods suitable for travelers in the North, that were otherwise scarce in the area. These included dried [[apricot]]s, [[fig]]s, and [[garshell]]s from the [[Tashalar]] and the lands around the [[Lake of Steam]]. The foods were of good quality to suit the high prices.\n\nDannath found any foods close to spoiling and converted them into another, longer lasting form, such as adding overripe [[fruit]]s in a [[wine]] or a [[syrup]] mash.\n\nDannath's daughters also offered aid and sanctuary to Harpers in the building's cellars. The cellars led to tunnels running under Yartar, exiting in several places, like [[Wink and the Kiss]] festhall.",
