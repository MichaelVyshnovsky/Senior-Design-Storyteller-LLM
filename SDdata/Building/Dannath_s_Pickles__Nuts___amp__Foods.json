His daughters were all Harpers.\nDannaths Pickles, Nuts, & Foods specialized in providing foods suitable for travelers in the North, that were otherwise scarce in the area. These included dried apricots, figs, and garshells from the Tashalar and the lands around the Lake of Steam. The foods were of good quality to suit the high prices.\nDannath found any foods close to spoiling and converted them into another, longer lasting form, such as adding overripe fruits in a wine or a syrup mash.\nDannaths daughters also offered aid and sanctuary to Harpers in the buildings cellars. The cellars led to tunnels running under Yartar, exiting in several places, like Wink and the Kiss festhall.\nCategoryShops\nCategoryFood shops\nCategoryRefuges\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryHarper locations\nCategoryLocations in Yartar\nCategoryLocations in the Savage Frontier\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nn9m0yfw2gnzch37253raqkxjutqpwto"
