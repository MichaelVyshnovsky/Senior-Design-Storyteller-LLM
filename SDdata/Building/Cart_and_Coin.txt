The Cart and Coin  was a caravan outfitter located in the crossroad town of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley in the mid-to-late 14 century and late 15 century DR.
It lay in the north of the town, between the west caravan campground and the Talking Troll.
Along with caravan gear and supplies and animal feed, the store sold and exchanged horses and draft animals and hired out caravan guards to caravans.
In the late 1400s DR, the Cart and Coin also offered horseshoeing services.
In the late 1400s DR, the store was run by married owners Arn and Syreen Widdens with their four young children. They had a half-dozen employees who fed, watered, and exercised animals, mucked out stables, and attached and removed horseshoes.
The business was in operation by the mid-1360s DR.
It was still in business after 1485 DR.
