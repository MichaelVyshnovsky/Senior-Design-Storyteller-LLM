The '''Three Towers''' was a performance club in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It was known for hosting traveling minstrels, singers and storytellers, including [[Rymrick the Bawd]], [[Dulchaesen]] and [[The Bell-Dwarves Three]]. On a night when no guest performer was available, a "Round of Ballades" was held by the staff, which was led by "Waterfall" [[Baerle Waszunn]].

==Location==
The club was located on a corner in the Dock Ward, at a junction between [[Drawn Sword Alley]], [[Leera's Alley]] and [[Watchrun Alley]].

==Crying To My Harp==
The club was the host of a notable performance of ''[[Crying To My Harp]]'' by the traveling minstrel [[Nymbrar Shatterslee|Nymbrar "Nighteye" Shatterslee]]. It was extremely popular with the patrons and the venue was so full that the windows were propped open so that people could watch from the alleys outside. The performance caused so many coins to be thrown that the staff collected them in baskets normally used for bread.
