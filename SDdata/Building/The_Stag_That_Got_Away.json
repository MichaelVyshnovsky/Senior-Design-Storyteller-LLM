        "mainbody": "'''The Stag That Got Away''' was an inn in [[Arrowmark]] in [[Tasseldale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "This quaint and quiet inn was known for the staggeringly high number of carvings of leaping [[stag]]s scattered throughout the structure. The building was a labyrinth of dark halls with walls lined in old wooden panels that held intricate carvings. The rooms were fully furnished with old, musty furniture.\n\nThe inn was also known locally for its lack of service. Other than preparing the room and during checkout, the staff of the inn were often nowhere in sight.\n\nA small rose garden was found in the back, complete with a pond filled with fish."
