The '''Blue Dragon's Bones''' was a rather standard dark, dirty, and rowdy tavern in the village of [[Hultail]].

==History==
This tavern was named for having once been the site of a [[wizard]] slaying a [[blue dragon]].

Around [[1368 DR]] this tavern was visited by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], who noted in his book [[Volo's Guide to Cormyr (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to Cormyr'']] that it had good [[ale]].
