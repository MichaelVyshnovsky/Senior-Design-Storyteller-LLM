The Blue Dragons Bones was a rather standard dark, dirty, and rowdy tavern in the village of Hultail.
This tavern was named for having once been the site of a wizard slaying a blue dragon.
Around 1368 DR this tavern was visited by Volothamp Geddarm, who noted in his book Volos Guide to Cormyr that it had good ale.
