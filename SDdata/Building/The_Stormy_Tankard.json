        "mainbody": "The Stormy Tankard was an inn in Scornubel during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe Stormy Tankard stood on Hethbridle Street.\nThe place had at least one side door. The stairs were narrow, and there was at least one narrow passageway leading to a secret door. Some of the rooms were accessible from that secret door.\nThe place was noisy and filthy, with minuscule rooms and rather rickety furniture.\nThe inn served rooms, had a common taproom, and much \"unclasped and uncloaked\" merriment, strongly implied to be carnal, was negotiated there.\nIn the , Shandril Shessair and Narm Tamaraith were pointed to the Stormy Tankard by Tessaril Winter while on their way to Silverymoon. Marlel, after rescuing them from the Sun Over Scornubel, helped the two newlyweds to the place they were ambushed inside the inn, thanks to Marlel, but he denied all knowledge of the ambush and helped them find Orthil Voldovan afterwards, who was downstairs in the taproom."
