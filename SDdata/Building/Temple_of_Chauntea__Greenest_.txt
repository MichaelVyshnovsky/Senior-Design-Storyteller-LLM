The Temple of Chauntea in Greenest was the one of the largest and most important sites in the entire town.
The temple was built of field stones arrange in a square, with a sloping roof made of slate.
Chaunteas altar was found directly in the center of the temple, with additional areas for prayer around it.
The temple was overseen by the half-elven priest of Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon.
When Greenest was assaulted by the Cult of the Dragon and their kobold minions in the 1480s DR, local townsfolk barricaded themselves within the temple.
