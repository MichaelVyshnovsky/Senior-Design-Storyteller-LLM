        "mainbody": "he Seminary of St. lhrvyn was an affluent, religious art school in Calimshan operated by the Church of Ilmater.\nThis seminary was located on a cliff overlooking the Shining Sea and opposite the city of Volothamp.\nThis seminary preached a gospel of peaceful understanding through painting, poetry, song, and sculpture. To this end, St. Ihrvyns had a large collection of statuettes from the Erehnir Dynasty and old Calishite statues to act as examples for its students to work from. However, many of these students could often be found huddled on the cliff staring right at the four visible heads of the Eight Erehnirs of Volothamp.\nAt some point in its history, this seminary took on a lay acolyte, a pasha who bequeathed the site his money after having lost his heirs as a result of the guild wars."
