Darkdance Manor was a large decrepit manor located in the west end of Westgate near Tidetown.
The manor had been maintained for years by the familys loyal dwarf servant Elevar. The manor had a magic gate that opened only for family members.
The manor was the ancestral home of House Darkdance although the last family members abandoned the property decades prior to 1480 DR, when Myrin Darkdance moved into the mansion.
