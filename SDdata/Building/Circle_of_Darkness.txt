The Circle of Darkness was a small temple dedicated to Cyric, the Dark Sun, in Zhentil Keep in 1358 DR.
The temple was led by High Priest Maskul Mirrormane and his cadre of clergymen. Given the predominant worship of Bane in Zhentil Keep at the time, the Circle of Darkness had only attracted a handful of loyal believers by 1358.
