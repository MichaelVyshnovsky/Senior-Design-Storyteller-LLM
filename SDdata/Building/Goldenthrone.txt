Goldenthrone was a palace in Port Nyanzaru that served as the meeting place for the citys merchant princes as well as its seat of government. It was the prime location for those who sought an audience with the merchant princes.
The palace was located in the citys Merchants Ward atop Throne Hill.
The palace was one of the most luxurious buildings in all of Port Nyanzaru.
The merchant princes were protected by eight members of the Chultan honor guard.
Goldenthrone was constructed several decades before the year the death curse struck Faer√ªn, at the behest of an Amnian trader.
