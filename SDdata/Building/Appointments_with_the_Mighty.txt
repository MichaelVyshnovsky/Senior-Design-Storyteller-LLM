Appointments with the Mighty was a shop located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Appointments with the Mighty could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
Rayad al-Farif owned and operated this establishment.
Rayad claimed to be able to make appointments for his customers with the heads of the various mosques or even the Grand Caliph. He only charged his customers if he succeeded in making the appointment.
For appointments with the Grand Caliph, Rayad merely signed his customer up to attend a public audience.
