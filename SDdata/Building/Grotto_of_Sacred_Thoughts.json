The idol was made of petrified brains and was carved to form the shape of a giant elder brain. There were thirty-six tentacles that came out of the statue&ndashall of which dug into the floor and then came out of the floor again to form columns along the edge of the cavern. At the top of the effigy rested the Encephalithid, which lived alongside Oryndolls tadpoles inside the Great Pool.\nThe Great Pool was the spiritual, social, and governmental heart of the city. The Venerators in Oryndoll also organized themselves out of this temple and were responsible for maintaining the Shrines of the Great Brain."
