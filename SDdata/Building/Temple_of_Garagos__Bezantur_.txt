The '''Temple of Garagos''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Garagos]] in the city of [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]], that also served as an [[inn]] known as '''Santhro's Rooming House''' in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located just inside the western wall of Bezantur&mdash;the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples"&mdash;just north of the city's [[west gate (Bezantur)|west gate]]. This gate made the temple convenient to caravans arriving in town from [[Thasselen]] and Thay's coastal cities.

==Structure==
The temple was located inside a rundown tenement building.

==Services==
As an inn, rooms could be rented from the Temple for one [[gold piece]] per month. Meals were only served to customers who asked nicely.

==Activities==
As a place of worship, the Temple catered to a small group of Garagos's faithful. Despite the congregation being small, they were enthusiastic about their god.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Temple of Garagos was one of only a few temples remaining to the god in all of [[Faer√ªn]] (once worshiped throughout the [[Sea of Fallen Stars|Inner Sea]]), and even within the City of a Thousand Temples, the Reaver was not a popular god as he was widely believed to have been killed by [[Tempus]]. This forced High Priest [[Santhro]] to fight against these perceptions, and ultimately to convert the temple into a boarding house in order to make some money.
