        "mainbody": "Rats End was an establishment in Heliogabalus as of the mid-14 century DR.\nOnce at some point between 1358 and 1370 DRThe story is assumed to occur during the reign of Gareth Dragonsbane, as Pavel Shemov claims the king is \"a paladin of Ilmater\" and this happens at least 2 years prior to 1373. Gareth Dragonsbane rose to power in 1359 DR, with no other kings of Damara known to be such paladins of Ilmater. The events are alluded to happen a summer prior to the events in the story. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the events of Silverfish occur between 1358 and 1370 DR. while tossing dice in Rats End, the initiate Pavel Shemov was accused of cheating. It took the intercession of gangster Kosef Demsk to keep the situation from getting dire afterwards, the two men struck a friendship."
