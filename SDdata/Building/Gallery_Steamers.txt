Gallery Steamers was a shipwright company that designed and built magical flying ships in Eileanar during the latter years of Netheril.
Although teleportation was popular, many within Netheril preferred to transport themselves or their goods via less overtly magical means. As such, flying ships like those made by Gallery Steamers remained in use for both passengers and cargo. Stuckley and his two supervisors Rousselet and Flue oversaw the companys operations, with Apulee, Fourcrow, Gau, and Bruck managing the employees who built and enchanted the ship hulls.
