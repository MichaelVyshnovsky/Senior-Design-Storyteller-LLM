        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Beshaba'''  was a place of worship dedicated to [[Beshaba]] in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the [[House of Iyachtu Xvim]] to the north, the temples of [[Temple of Talos (Bezantur)|Talos]] and [[Temple of Kossuth (Bezantur)|Kossuth]] to the south, and the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] to the west.",
        "Structure": "The temple looked to be a jumble of different buildings from the outside. On the inside, this made it a confusing maze of sharp turns, dead-ended halls and stairwells, and hidden doors and traps.",
        "Activities": "The temple was surprisingly popular with the people of Bezantur, although they mostly observed Beshaba in hopes that her [[priest]]s would not cause any bad luck, which they were known to enjoy doing.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Beshaba was widely worshiped across Thay at small shrines, but she had no temples. However, by the late 1360s DR, the Temple of Beshaba had become a well-established place of her worship in Bezantur.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, the temple was occupied by [[Church of Beshaba|Beshaban]] priests who both lived and worked on the premises, and who were said to be the only ones who could navigate its confusing architecture (and only the highest ranking priests were said to know about everything contained within the temple). The priesthood was led by [[Doommaster]] [[Hargrim Theos]]."
