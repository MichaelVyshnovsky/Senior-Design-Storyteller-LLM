As of 1375 DR, Jhaeles oldest son, Durgo Silvermane, had taken on the duties as innkeeper of the Old Skull.\nIt consisted of three floors and a cellar.\nThe Old Skull Inn was built in 1280 DR by Buldo Silvermane on top of the ruins of the Twisted Tower Inn. The Old Skull became a common stop for adventurers, merchants, and travelers along the North Ride.\nSome time in late 1359 DR, or 1360 DR, a group of Harpers held a meeting at the inn to discuss what should be done about the growing Zhentarim threat in Anauroch. In the end, it was decided that the inexperienced member of the group Lander would travel out to the great desert and uncover information about the Zhents activities.\nDuring the Zhentarim invasion in 1375 DR, the inn was taken over.\nThe Old Skull was known for the honesty of its staff, the quality of the food and drink, and its relative safety in the center of Shadowdale.\n* Jhaele Silvermane, owner/innkeeper\n* Durgo Silvermane, assistant innkeeper and farmer\n* Bardag Shultu, hostler and stablemaster\n* Dora Leen, chambermaid\n* Meltea, chambermaid\n* Turko Breem, cook and waiter\n* Durman Hilesta, carpenter and bouncer, until 1375 DR when he was killed in a bar brawl.\nIt was rumored that there were secret passages beneath The Old Skull Inn that lead to The Old Skull Tor and eventually to the Underdark."
