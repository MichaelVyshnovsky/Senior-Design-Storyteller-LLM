        "mainbody": "ondakars House was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the mid–14 century DR.\nThis big inn stood in the middle of the citys High District, and its high prices and high quality reflected that.\nAs Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Hondakars House was expressly an inn."
