        "mainbody": "The '''Wheloon Watch House''' was a watch house located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. It stood at the intersection of [[Wheloon Way]] and the [[Way of the Manticore]].\n\nThe watch house was a base for the [[Wheloon Watch]] and also served as a barracks for the local [[Purple Dragons]]. Also a part of the building was the Wheloon Jail and an armory. Around thirty Dragons manned the watch house at a time, either hearing public complaints, guarding the jail, or sleeping.Though not explicitly stated, the Wheloon Watch may safely be assumed to be based out of the Wheloon Watch House by its name. As a civilian volunteer force, they likely do not need to live at the barracks.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, some prisoners of the Wheloon Jail, those who chose to repent and perform holy service in exchange for their sentences being commuted, were recruited to serve as [[generic temple guard|temple guards]] for the new [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]]."
