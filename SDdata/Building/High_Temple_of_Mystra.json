        "mainbody": "The '''High Temple of Mystra''' on [[Mount Talath]] was said by some to be the center of all magic in [[Halruaa]].",
        "Location": "The temple was built near the summit of Mount Talath and within the caverns below its surface.",
        "Structure": "The temple was an impressive many-spired structure of stone with crystal walls. The architecture was such that some parts of the structure could not possibly stand without the aid of magic, such as [[Wall of force|''walls of force'']]. Some of its towers seemed impossibly tall.",
        "Services and Activities": "Anyone wishing to worship [[Mystra]] was granted free access to a limited area of the temple designated for such worship.\n\nAlthough it functioned as a normal temple of Mystra, the temple of Mount Talath's library was its primary draw for visitors. Visitors not native to Halruaa were subjected to a thorough magical screening process. Even if they passed these tests, they had only limited access to the vaults and library below. Members of the [[Council of Elders (Halruaa)|Council of Elders]] were permitted access to most levels, but other guests were restricted to certain areas. Non-natives were required to pay 1,500 [[gold piece]]s worth of coin, jewels or magic items to enter the library. From here, such visitors had limited access to a private store of magical lore. For an additional 200 gold pieces per day, visitors could request access to specific tomes and peruse them in peace in reading rooms as long as they agreed to be watched by a lorekeeper.\n\nThese tomes were brought up from a cavern complex built under the temple in the rock of the mountain itself. None but the temple clergy had access to this section, and it was well-warded against would-be thieves. So vast was the collection, that it could sometimes take as long as five or six years for a [[wizard]] to find the information he or she was looking for, and some [[Divination|diviners]] dedicated their entire lives to inventing new spells simply for locating information with the temple's caverns. It was generally believed that no one truly knew how much knowledge the library contained.",
        "Defenses": "The temple was full of protective [[abjuration]] magics. Thieves and spies were regularly found in the caverns burnt or frozen to death or simply as piles of dust.\n\nIn addition to the magical protections of the temple itself, the fortress of [[Talathgard]] at the base of the mountain protected it from unwanted visitors.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "The [[Cultist of the Shattered Peak|Cult of the Shattered Peak]] was believed to have at least one agent among those living in the village, as there was much lore on the magic of [[Netheril]] contained within the caverns.",
        "Inhabitants": "In [[1373 DR]], the temple's high priestess was the powerful [[cleric]] [[Greila Sontoin]], but she was very old.\n\nA [[Mount Talath (town)|small town]] surrounded the temple complex and housed its staff."
