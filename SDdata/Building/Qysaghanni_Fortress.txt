The '''Qysaghanni Fortress''' was the headquarters of the [[syl-pasha]] of [[Calimshan]]'s Imperial Guard, [[Qysaghanni|el Qysaghanni]].

==Location==
The fortress was located in [[Palace Ward]] of [[Calimport]], but it did not belong to any of that wards ''[[sabban]]''. It was immediately adjacent to the [[Pasha's Sabban]] to the north. Its walls bordered [[Darehj Sabban]] to the west and [[Najlet Sabban]] to the east. To the south was [[Tavihr Sabban]] in neighboring [[Armada Ward]].

==Structure==
The fortress was a cluster of three- and four-story buildings and included a five-story, free-standing  minaret.

The minaret was called the '''Lambent Minaret''' and stood in the center of the fortress complex. It appeared to be made entirely of transparent blue crystal; one could see through the tower to see the fortress walls on the other side. However, it was impossible to see anything on the actual inside of the tower, even through thew open archways at the minaret's balconies.

==Defenses==
The defensive walls of the fortress connected to the neighboring wall of the Pasha's Sabban, and they stood taller than the parallel walls of the other three bordering ''sabbans''.

==Interior==
The fortress contained an armory and a library.) There was a courtyard for combat drills and spell practice.

Secret passages from the fortress led through ''sabban'' walls into the Pasha's Sabban, to each of its buildings.

==Inhabitants==
The fortress served as a garrison for the 500 troops of el Qysaghanni.

==Activities==
The Qysaghanni owned a set of five [[flying carpet]]s, with which they frequently set out patrols over the areas surrounding the Pasha's Sabban, launching from the Lambent Minaret.
