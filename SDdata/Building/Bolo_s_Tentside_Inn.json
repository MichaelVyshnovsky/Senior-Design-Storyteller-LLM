        "mainbody": "Bolos Tentside Inn was an boarding house set up in the makeshift settlement that formed around Boareskyr Bridge during the latter half of the 15 century DR. It was run by a rather talkative halfling woman named Bolo.\nThe inn was set up in the central pavilion of Boareskyr Bridges tent-structure settlement.\nSome time in the 1480s DR, a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon named Varram killed a yuan-ti spy in the inn, by stabbing it with his dragontooth dagger.\nIt had a reputation as a rather rowdy establishment."
