'''Farwatch Tower''' was one of the major torchtowers of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Trollwall]], located in the city's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]].Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of "torchtower."<ref group="note" name="major">The sourcebook ''[[City System]]'' states that all torchtowers with names are "major towers".

==Location==
This tower was located at the end of [[Tower March]], just north of [[Watch Alley]].

==Structure==
Farwatch Tower stood five stories tall and was directly connected to the Trollwall that bounded the city and separated North Ward from the [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]].
===Interior===
Being a torchtower,<ref group="note" name="torchtower" /> Farwatch Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-17 - Waterdeep's Torchtowers}} Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.<ref><ref group="note" name="major" />

Behind an open doorway in the tower's southeastern wall, was a tall yet tiny bare sentry post with walls several feet thick, that was regularly monitored by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]. This was because the sentry post was both haunted and contained a secret ''[[portal]]'' to [[Maldiglasâ€™s Refuge]]. Despite their best efforts, it was often utilized by conspirators, lovers, and beggars seeking shelter.<ref>

==Activities==
Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.

==Inhabitants==
Farwatch Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch.
