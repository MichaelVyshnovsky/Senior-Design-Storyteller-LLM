        "mainbody": "The Eastside was a comfortable inn found in the town of Termalaine during the late 15 century DR. It was owned and operated by the fisherman Clyde and for a time, his wife.\nWhile the inn comprised a single structure, its exterior appeared to be several buildings clustered together.\nThe inn offered some of the best accommodations in all of Icewind Dale. Patrons were tended to by the young girl Marta, who helped Clyde after the passing of his wife."
