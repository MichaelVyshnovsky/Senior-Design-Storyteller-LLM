        "Location": "This abbey was located close to [[Mount Waterdeep]] and north of [[Nimoar's Hold]].",
        "Structure": "The abbey was a complex of buildings constructed of stone, each sporting stained glass windows that depicted Chauntea. Surrounding these buildings were glass greenhouses.",
        "Activities": "The abbots of this complex gathered flora that would have otherwise been lost during the [[Orcfastings War]],{{Cite adventurers league/Hero of the Troll Wars|2}} such as [[Chauntea's Token]], and planted them in their fields so they could be carefully preserved. These plants were utterly unique and were in danger of extinction.",
        "Inhabitants": "This abbey was operated by a group who called themselves the [[Sisters of Chauntea]]. These included the Sisters [[Earthtender]] and [[Warm Hearth]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|940}}, [[Gharl|Warlord Gharl]] and his men set fire to the fields in an effort to stop the coming advance of [[troll]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Hero of the Troll Wars|4}} Smoke went on to shade the sky and it was not long before the fields around the abbey were ablaze, the raging flames devouring all crops in their wake. The Sisters rushed to harvest a sample of each plant in the fields around their abbey, even if it meant sacrificing their lives. Sister Warm Hearth was most concerned about the field of Chauntea's Token being burned, it being most precious of all the plants and guarded by a [[dryad]] that attacked anyone who approached it in its immature state.\n\nDuring this time, a group of time-displaced [[adventurer]]s from the 15{{th}} century DR came to the abbey and did what they could to aid the struggling Sisters."
