Transgate Industries was a planar research and portal development company in Eileanar during the last years of Netheril, before .
The business specialized in the creation of portals, gates, and other magical passages. The founders Ocelot and Ytartia developed their own unique type of gateway spell that was far more stable and safe than any other, and also did not inflict a sense of confusion and lost equilibrium on the user, making even interplanar travel much more comfortable. Their children Shander, Thamer, and Acciajuoli followed in their parents footsteps and continued to refine and master the study of portals.
