        "mainbody": "The '''Forge of Surtur''', formerly known as the '''Fane of Lolth''', was a temple in [[Szith Morcane]]{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|23}} that was open for the denizens of the settlement to come and worship. The temple was originally dedicated to the goddess [[Lolth]], but began being converted into a temple to [[Surtur]] by the forgepriest [[Dengor Bloodheart]]{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|20}}",
        "Location": "Located above the seat of [[House Morcane]] in [[Szith Morcane]], the Fane of Lolth was reached only by ascending one of its eight spiderweb ladders. Sometime after its occupation, a secondary entrance was constructed to connect the temple to [[Dengor's Palace]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|22}}",
        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "Inside the Fane of Lolth, the temple was separated into the outer fane (which formed the forepart of the spider-structure) and the inner fane (which formed the abdomen section of the spider-structure). These two sections were divided by a heavy [[iron]] gate that could only be passed safely by female [[drow]] worshipers of Lolth.\n\nThe outer fane was shaped to appear like the front section of a gigantic spider. \n\nThe inner fane comprised a pair of short, curved walls within which was a long sacrificial altar. Plush carpets covered the floor and were adorned with numerous pillows and cushions. Behind the back wall of the inner fane was a small vestry that housed the temple's sacred texts, clerical vestments, and ceremonial items.\n\nSometime following Szith Morcane's occupation by fire giants, an addition was made to the temple in the form of a large forge."
        },
        "Services": "As the center of worship for the inhabitants of Szith Morcane, the Fane of Lolth admitted worshipers of Lolth into the outer fane daily. Within the inner fane, rites of summoning and sacrifice took place among the clergy.",
        "Defenses": "Merely accessing the Fane of Lolth was a test of faith. Eight spiderweb ladders led to the temple but each ladder was enchanted with an effect that upon touching entangled any creature that did not worship Lolth. The webs were especially difficult to avoid, owing to the narrow crawlspace, and were seemingly immune to burning.\n\nThe altar in the inner fane was warded with an effect that would [[energy drain|sap the life]] from any living creature that touched it. In addition, after losing contact with the altar, the body of any creature slain on the altar would then rise as a [[spectre]].\n\nIn addition, the heavy iron gate that separated the inner and outer fanes would ''[[summon monster VII|summon]]'' a [[bebilith]] to attack any who touched the gate unless they were female drow priestess of Lolth.\n\nFollowing Szith Morcane's occupation by fire giants many of these defenses were disabled. In their place, the temple was guarded by [[helmed horror]]s and [[hell hound]]s.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/The Occupation of Szith Morcane|9,22}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, during the [[Silence of Lolth]], the Fane of Lolth was stormed by the worshipers of [[Kiaransalee]], who slaughtered the entirety of its inhabitants. Although the gate to the inner fane was shattered, the potent magical wards still persisted in the temple. Many of the bodies of the priestess were raised as [[quth-maren]] and much of the valuable items were sent back to [[Maerimydra]]. Only the high priestess, [[Alisannara Morcane]], remained to guard the temple in unlife as a [[keening spirit]].",
        "Inhabitants": "While the temple's former clergy were all drow, led by the high priestess Alissannara Morcane, forgepriest Dengor Bloodheart surrounded himself with [[azer]] clerics and [[acolyte]]s. Additionally, two [[salamander]]s that had been conjured were trapped in the temple within the confines of a magical circle, forced to work its forge. The azer controlled these salamanders were a set of pendants enchanted with the [[spell]]s ''[[planar binding]]'', ''[[protection from evil and good]]'', and ''[[sanctuary]]''."
