'''Hriiat Fine Pastries''' was a popular bakery shop in the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>

==Location==
This bakery was along the midpoint of [[Sammarin's Street]], in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of Waterdeep.

==Structure==
The building of this establishment stood two stories tall.

==Services==
Hriiat's sold a variety of both savory and sweet pastries that were suitable for eating on the go along the streets of Waterdeep. These included [[almond]]-and-[[apple]] [[sugar]] [[tart]]s for a single [[copper piece]]; [[bite pie]]s filled with either [[beef]], [[pork]], or a [[curried]] mixed of meats for 2 cp, as well as ones stuffed with [[fish]] for 1 cp; and Hriiat's own original pastry, the [[meal loaf]], which was a favorite among visiting merchants.

In addition to food, the bakery sold fine cloth [[belt]]-[[towel]]s, so that customers could clean themselves of any mess they made while eating on the go.

==Reputation==
The popularity of Hriiat Fine Pastries was such that crowds and crowded lines near constantly formed outside whenever the smell of a fresh batch of pastries wafted in the air. And many visiting merchants were willing to trot across the city to get a bite of one of its meal loafs.

==History==
Hriiat Fine Pastries was among the many that [[Volothamp Geddarm]] highlighted in his book ''[[Volo's Guide to Waterdeep (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Waterdeep]]''.

==Inhabitants==
This bakery was owned and operated by [[Relchoz Hriiat]], the public speaker for the city's [[Baker's Guild]].The book ''Adventurer's Guide to the City'' in the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'' boxed-set states that the Hriiat Fine Pastries is run by "the master of the Bakers' Guild". This would make the owner [[Dundold Buldharroaz]]. However, other sources, including the two other books included within that box-set, clearly state that the owner is Relchoz Hriiat. The jolly fellow often sampled his own wares and was known for offering sample bites to customers.
