Hriiat Fine Pastries was a popular bakery shop in the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.
This bakery was along the midpoint of Sammarins Street, in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
The building of this establishment stood two stories tall.
Hriiats sold a variety of both savory and sweet pastries that were suitable for eating on the go along the streets of Waterdeep. These included almond-and-apple sugar tarts for a single copper piece bite pies filled with either beef, pork, or a curried mixed of meats for 2 cp, as well as ones stuffed with fish for 1 cp and Hriiats own original pastry, the meal loaf, which was a favorite among visiting merchants.
In addition to food, the bakery sold fine cloth belt-towels, so that customers could clean themselves of any mess they made while eating on the go.
The popularity of Hriiat Fine Pastries was such that crowds and crowded lines near constantly formed outside whenever the smell of a fresh batch of pastries wafted in the air. And many visiting merchants were willing to trot across the city to get a bite of one of its meal loafs.
Hriiat Fine Pastries was among the many that Volothamp Geddarm highlighted in his book Volos Guide to Waterdeep.
This bakery was owned and operated by Relchoz Hriiat, the public speaker for the citys Bakers Guild.The book Adventurers Guide to the City in the City of Splendors boxed-set states that the Hriiat Fine Pastries is run by "the master of the Bakers Guild". This would make the owner Dundold Buldharroaz. However, other sources, including the two other books included within that box-set, clearly state that the owner is Relchoz Hriiat. The jolly fellow often sampled his own wares and was known for offering sample bites to customers.
