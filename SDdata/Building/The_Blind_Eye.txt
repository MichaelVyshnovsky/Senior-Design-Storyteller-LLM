The '''Blind Eye''' was a tack and harness shop located just outside of the city walls of [[Westgate]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Location==
The shop was located outside of Westgate's [[West Gate (Westgate)|West Gate]] by the [[Cormaeril]] yards.

==Activities==
The Blind Eyes sold tack and harness and trail goods. This was actually a front as the shop's owner was a fence for stolen goods. The location of the Blind Eye outside of the city walls granted it exemption from regulations that would have otherwise been imposed within the city. Nonetheless, the [[Croamarkh]]'s agents kept a close eye on the shop's activities.
