        "mainbody": "The '''Driftwood Tavern''' was a fine inn and tavern, which also doubled as a museum, located in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} to late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. In the latter half of 1400s DR, it was run by [[Madame Rosene]].",
        "Description": "It stood within a partially collapsed tower.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "It catered to a richer clientele than other similar establishments in Neverwinter, and its patrons were largely long-term patrons, citizens, and friends. Both Neverwintan and Waterdhavian nobles, including [[Margaster]]s, could be seen in its common room. In addition, visitors to Neverwinter would come here to look at the Neverwintan relics and learn about the old city.\n\nIt was a place of peaceful contemplation, not for raucous revelry but such things were not unknown there either."
        },
        "Services": "Drinks, meals, and rooms were quite expensive in the Driftwood Tavern around [[1479 DR]]. One could also hear stories about old Neverwinter from Madame Rosen, at least after they'd paid for their drinks and meal.",
        "History": "The Driftwood Tavern was built years before [[1385 DR]], and it survived both the [[Spellplague]] and the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] nearly unscathed, and this was a point of pride for the staff. Following the eruption in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, Madame Rosene opened the inn up a shelter for refugees. The Driftwood Tavern even served as a meeting place and a city hall of sorts, in the turbulent years before [[Dagult Neverember]] reclaimed Neverwinter.\n\nAround 1479 DR, the Driftwood Tavern was a meeting place and unofficial headquarters for members of the [[Sons of Alagondar#The Graycloaks|Graycloaks]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, [[Regis]] visited the Driftwood Tavern the same night as [[Bronkyn Stoneshaft]] and his [[dwarves]] stood on the tables and sang of their return to [[Thornhold]]. Meeting Madame Rosene, he offered to sell [[wine]]s from the [[halfling]] of [[Bleeding Vines]]. He later shared drinks with [[Alvilda Margaster|Alvilda]] and [[Inkeri Margaster]]. [[Artemis Entreri]] later challenged Regis over his lack of secrecy at the Driftwood Tavern when they met later that year.<ref>\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves publicity image 6.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''This table won't do at all, someone's put a hole in it.'']]\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} during Neverwinter's [[High Sun Games]], the thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]] rented an upstairs room at the Driftwood Tavern so they could create a ''[[portal]]'' from their ''[[hither-thither staff]]'' in a table and infiltrate the [[Castle Never]] vault. However, also at the tavern was [[Jil Torbo]], a member of the [[Absolution Council]] who recognized Edgin and Holga from their escape from [[Revel's End]]. She fetched the [[Neverwinter Guard]], but by the time they arrived, the thieves had gone their separate ways and Doric was through the ''portal''.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}"
