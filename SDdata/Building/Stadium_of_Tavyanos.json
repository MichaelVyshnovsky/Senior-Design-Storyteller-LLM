It was one of the few structures in the quarter that was untouched by the overgrowth of the Three Gates Reef by 1371 DR.\nThis stadium stood three stories tall and had a sublevel, containing a number of cells and staging areas.\nDuring the Twelfth Ser√¥s War, the forces of Iakhovas forced the merfolk of Eadraal to abandon their city of Voalidru and a number of other towns,\nIn 1371 DR, a High Merpriest of Eadro named Narvolas joined the refugees, using his expertise to tend to the injured. Narvolas was approached by Prince-Regent Mirol III of Eadraal, having been told by a mysterious fish that the priest knew of a way to reclaim Voalidru. Narvolas then informed Mirol III about his experiences during the siege on Voalidru and of an undead repelling relic known as the Akriloth before sending him away."
