The Brown Horse was a tavern in Thundertree in the 15 century DR.
The tavern was located to the northwest of the village, close to its entrance.
Its exterior was well-kept, even after the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. The intact, stony wall had a sign close to the entry door of a horse holding a tankard of ale.
The building was split into two sections its eastern side housed the common room, whilst its western side housed the brewing canisters and kitchen.
The Brown Horse was well known for it brilliant ale, and the tavern itself smelled of brewers yeast.
After the eruption, when the owners had been driven out or killed, ash zombies took residence in the tavernâ€”some even gathered under the bar.
