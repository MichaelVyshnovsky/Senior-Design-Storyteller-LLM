        "Location": "The inn was situated on the island immediately south of [[Starwater Keep]] – [[Old Arn Isle]], on the crossing of [[Varanth Lane]] and [[Chancever Street]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220416130132/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_050607-04.htmp| title = So Saith Ed May – Jul 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}",
        "Structure": "The leaky building was infested with vermin and offered poor quality food. The Barrelstone was always cold with [[moss]]es crawling around the damp bedchamber walls and mildew leaving a pungent smell throughout the inn. Luckily, the food did not taste like mildew, but it was wet, freezing, and generally disgusting.",
        "Inhabitants": "The gnomes who ran the Barrelstone were a bright aspect of the crummy inn; always telling jokes and playing pranks on each other. In the rundown building, the staff was always dancing around and singing good music. The gnomes were also great story tellers and ballad makers, but even their [[bard|bardic]] abilities were no match for the awfulness of the Barrelstone Inn."
