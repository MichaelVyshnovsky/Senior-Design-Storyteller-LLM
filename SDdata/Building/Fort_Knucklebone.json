        "mainbody": "'''Fort Knucklebone''' was a stronghold in [[Avernus]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Fort Knucklebone was a junkyard stronghold situated on the edge of a desolate expanse of Avernus that was plagued by rival scavenger gangs. It served as a haven for the [[Knucklebones (gang)|Knucklebones]], a gang of wasteland marauders led by [[Mad Maggie]].  Within the fort, the Knucklebones built and repaired [[infernal war machine]]s.",
        "Relations": "Mad Maggie had struck an uneasy agreement with the [[archdevil]] [[Zariel]]. In this agreement, Zariel agreed to leave Fort Knucklebone alone as long as Mad Maggie kept the other warlords in check in the surrounding area.",
        "Inhabitants": "* Mad Maggie, a [[night hag]] warlord and leader of the Knucklebones gang.\n* [[Chukka]] and [[Clonk]], two [[kenku]] loyal to Mad Maggie.\n* [[Barnabas]], a [[flameskull]].\n* [[Mickey]], a [[fiendish flesh golem]] created by Mad Maggie.\n* [[Pins]] and [[Needles]], a pair of [[imp]]s.\n* Sixty [[redcap]]s and thirty [[madcap]]s, although a third of them operated outside the fort, patrolling the areas of the wasteland controlled by Mad Maggie.",
        "Infernal War Machines": "Fort Knucklebone housed numerous infernal war machines in different stages of disrepair and cannibalization. These vehicles included three [[Devil's Ride]]s, four [[Tormentor]]s, a [[Demon Grinder]], and a [[Scavenger (infernal war machine)|Scavenger]] that Mad Maggie used for salvage operations. Most of the vehicles were not for sale or trade."
