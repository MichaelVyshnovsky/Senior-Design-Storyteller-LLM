'''Quaylin's Home for Wayward Boys''' was a building in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] owned by the former pirate [[Quaylin McKurk]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. McKurk passed himself off as a fisherman and his Home as a shelter for the less fortunate, but in actuality it was a front for a press gang he ran.{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|8}}

==Location==
Quaylin's Home stood directly on the waterfront in the city's [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]].

==Structure==
This building stood three stories tall and was constructed of stone. It had a rundown appearance, with empty crates and old [[net]]s lying outside. A small, painted wooden sign hung above the entrance that bore the name of the establishment. The entry door was painted a faded, dingy shade of gray, suggesting it had once been painted white. Along the side of the building, near the front door, was an enclosed staircase leading up to the second floor. This was the only means of accessing that level of the building.

==Interior==
The ground floor of Quaylin's Home consisted of a living room and kitchen, which were both sparsely furnished. Beneath the table in the kitchen was a concealed trap door that opened into the building's basement, which was utilized by the Quaylin's gang as a cell. The second floor of the building housed the living quarters of its permanent residents.

The third floor of the building was simply an attic, kept dusty and cluttered by with the various treasures of Quaylin. The only way to access it was a trap door that opened into his bedroom.

==Services==
The press gang of Quaylin's Home spent its time luring in or waylaying drunkards and urchins with the intent of selling their services off disreputable sea captain. Quaylin preferred to lure in impressionable
youths by telling of his old seafaring adventures. Red Tarn and Durgan preferred a direct, brute force approach with drunkards. And the female of the group, Micki, preferred to romance drunkards and spin false promises that she would sign up with them on a client's ship.

==History==
The press gang business of Quaylin's Home was proving to be fairly successful and profitable by [[1361 DR]]. By that time Quaylin was paying off several members of the [[Harbor Patrol]] to look the other way in regards to his business. Though the local [[thieves' guild]] was rather displeased with the press gang, having lost more than a few of their cutpurses to them.''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR.

Around [[1370 DR]], a string of arson fires left a boy named [[Robby Wirth]] orphaned. With nowhere else to turn, Robby stayed at Quaylin's Home for Wayward Boys{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|4}} after being enticed by Quaylin. Around that same time an [[Umberlant]] [[unnamed Umberlant preacher|priest]] was erratically preaching around the docks that a catacylsm was on the horizon and only those who wore blue collars, a common symbol of deference towards [[Umberlee]], would be spared. Not wanting any trouble, Quaylin's whole gang began wearing these collars, acquiring them from [[Tym's Supple Leather Shoppe]].

Quaylin's gang planned to smuggle Robby out to a sea captain within two days, but Robby had fallen in love with a young woman and made plans to runaway together to the city of [[Procampur]] and get married. He confided in Micki, who then informed the rest of the press gang. When Robby later met up with the girl within an alley, the press gang approached and Red Tarn bashed him over the head, abducting him back to the Home, with one of them commenting "So you think you can escape!" The girl screamed, catching the attention of the nearby Umberlant preacher, but he wasn't fast enough to intervene. The only thing left behind from the ambush was Robby's own blue collar. The gang would come to realize that Tarn had hit the boy too hard, leaving him unconscious as they placed him on a cot within the Home's basement.

The next day a group of [[adventurer]]s would be apprehended by the [[Harbor Patrol]] under suspicion of being the ones responsible, with the girl who witnessed the crime identifying them as looking like the culprits and their names being given by the Umberlant preacher based on her description of the assailants.{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|5}} Eventually their investigation brought them to Quaylin's Home. As they arrived Quaylin was in the living room discussing with Micki where they might find another able-body within the next two days, while Durgan and Red Tarn were asleep in the living quarters. Quaylin feigned ignorance at Robby's abduction, claiming that he had left for Procampur the other day and requested Micki to fetch the others to see if they might know of anyone with a grudge against Robby.{{Cite organized play/LC/Slaves to Fashion|9}}

According to some accounts the City Watch were in fact brought down, to which Quaylin quickly showed them to the basement and Robby. He spun an elaborate lie of them having went looking for Robby when he didn't come back after curfew and that they had found him knocked out in an alley. He put forth the idea that the attackers were intent on murdering the boy and that he was previously being coy as he had believed the adventurers were in league with the true culprits. The Watch would buy Quaylin's shoddy story, but allowed the adventurers to take Robby into their custody if they so desired.

==Inhabitants==
Besides Quaylin McKurk himself, the Home was primarily inhabited by his trusty companions [[Durgan]], [[Micki]], and [[Red Tarn]]. There was often a notable absence of "boys" on the premises of Quaylin's Home, but whenever pressed about this McKurk would wave away the suspicision by explaining his rehabilitation program was simply so effective that all the boys "found their way and no longer need him."
