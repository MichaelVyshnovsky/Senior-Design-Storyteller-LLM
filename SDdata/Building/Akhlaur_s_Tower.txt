'''Akhlaur's tower''' was created by the [[Akhlaur|eponymous]] [[wizard]] in 12th-century DR.

The tower resided in the middle of the [[Akhlaur Swamp|swamp]] that bore the spellcaster's name and had long since been abandoned since he called it home. As the waters of the swamp grew, the tower sunk, and became partially submerged. In the [[Year of Wild Magic]] the tower stood out enough to still be entered and explored.

Considering how powerful a wizard Akhlaur was, there was likely a wealth of magical items and [[arcane]] secrets inside.
