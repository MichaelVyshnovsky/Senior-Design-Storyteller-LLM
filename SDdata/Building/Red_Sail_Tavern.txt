Red Sail Tavern, also known as the Sail, was a tavern in the city of Ravens Bluffs island neighborhood of Ladyrock in the late 14 century DR.
The building was constructed out of various dark-paneled, salvaged fittings and timbers, from scrapped or wrecked ships.
The Sail was a dim and smoky tavern, catering primarily to sailors. The authorities and "landlubbers" were often not welcomed by the clientele.
The Sail was the busiest business establishment in the whole of Ladyrock.
