        "mainbody": "St. Doblas Abbey was a remote Ilmatari abbey named for Saint Dobla. It was notably the fourth oldest Ilmatari site in the nation of Calimshan.\nThis remote abbey was located in the Marching Mountains of Calimshan.\nLike other Ilmatari abbeys and cloisters in the Marching Mountains, who were beyond the reach of the syl-pasha, the clergy of St. Doblas were among the most active of Calimshans Ilmatari clergies in regards to the protection and freeing of slaves.\nUniquely, the clergy of St. Doblas was focused on preaching equality and coexistence among the genders and sexes. Their abbey was considered to be among the few places in Calimshan where women could not only openly wield influence, but pursue an education.\nThe clergy of St. Dobla was primarily made up of women and was one of the most populous of the Marching Mountain clergies.\nHaving a largely female clergy, some outsiders had the false assumption that its members were proponents of matriarchy. In addition, due to the martyr Saint Dobla having been a jhasina in life, some crudely believed that the abbeys clergy engaged in licentious and wanton activities."
