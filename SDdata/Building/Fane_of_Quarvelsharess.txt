The '''Fane of Quarvelsharess''', also called the '''Fane of the Goddess''', was a public [[cathedral]] dedicated to [[Lolth]] in the district of [[West Wall]] in [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
The Fane of the Quarvelsharess was a "gift" of [[House Baenre]], providing, for the first time, a place for the general public to worship. Its construction out of stone was an "epic union of artistry and [[engineering]]" that was completed in [[1475 DR]].

==Staff==
[[Sos'Umptu Baenre]] was a high priestess at the Fane.
