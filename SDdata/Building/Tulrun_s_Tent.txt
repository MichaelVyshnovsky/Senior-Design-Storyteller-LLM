Tulruns Tent was a magical tent found in the eastern Cold Wood belonging to the archmage Tulrun, whose association with the object led to moniker "Tulrun of the Tent".  
From the outside, it looked like a colorful silk tent perched on top a plain wooden platform held on five thin wooden legs about  up. While it could walk, the tent often flew when requested by Tulrun.
Wanderers entering the tent became lost in an extradimensional labyrinth of stairs, rooms and corridors composed of glowing white mist. Tulrun was using several detection spells to understand the real intentions of the intruders.
