The Arrowsar Appartments was a rather ornate, rental complex in the city of Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR.
This building was located along Snail Street, in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
The Arrowsar Apartments were constructed sometime after 1367 DR, atop the site once occupied by the Heartflame festhall, following the latter being burnt to the ground on the Night of Pirates.
