'''The Anchorage''' was a cozy inn of well repute in [[New Velar|Harrowdale]].

==Locations==
The Anchorage was located near the center of town at the intersection of [[Melurk Street]] and [[Moonside Lane]].

==Atmosphere==
Each of the rooms of the Anchorage was practically sound proof thanks to thick stone walls and tapestries. Every room featured its own fire grate and enough furnishing to make a guest feel right at home.

==Services==
Rooms at the Anchorage cost 14 [[sp]] per night per head, but that price included meals and stabling of a single beast. Any drink other than milk or mintwater cost extra, as did storing a wagon or stabling extra beasts.

==Inhabitants==
The Anchorage was staffed by four familes and plenty of children were around to help with chores and they were surprisingly well-behaved.
