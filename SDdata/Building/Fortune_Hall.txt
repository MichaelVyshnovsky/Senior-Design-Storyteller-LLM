Fortune Hall was a temple in the city of Silverymoon dedicated to the goddess Tymora.
Fortune Hall was located in the eastern part of the Northbank section of Silverymoon, northeast of the Silverglen and west of the Tower of Balance.
This temple was rather small in size.
The clergy of this temple sponsored a parlor on the southern shore of Silverymoon, near the River Rauvin, in which soldiers would play games of chance.
Fortune Hall was run in the mid-to-late 14 century DR by the priestess Shermata Cheng. This came to an end circa 1372 DR, when she was killed while out exploring with a band of adventurers. She was mourned for a tenday period before being swiftly replaced by Aratha Sul, much to the objection of some that it was occurring too soon.
