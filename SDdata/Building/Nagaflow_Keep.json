The workmen were attacked by giant frogs from the Nagaflow river during its construction.\nRansar Osorkon of Innarlith decided to build a keep on the southern part of the Nagaflow river in order to keep better watch on the area. Construction of the keep began in Mirtul of the . The main architect of the project was Ivar Devorast, but because he began construction of the keep without permission from Senator Inthelph, the Master Builder of Innarlith, he was dismissed from the site before its completion.\nLater, when Osorkon sent Devorast to carry out the digging of a canal that would connect the Nagaflow to the Lake of Steam, the Nagaflow Keep was chosen as the endpoint of the northern end of the canal and it was used as a base by Devorast and the workmen in the project."
