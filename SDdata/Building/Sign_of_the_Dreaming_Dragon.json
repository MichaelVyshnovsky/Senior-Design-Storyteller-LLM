        "mainbody": "he Sign of the Dreaming Dragon was an inn in the city of Iriaebor in the mid–14 century DR and owned by a halfling couple, Estah and Jolle.\nThey sold all sorts of drinks and food, from spiced wine to Estahs own brew, a foamy red ale. An ale was 2 sp. \nThe inn stood at the westernmost end of the Tor.\nIt was an old, three-storied building with a half-timbered gable-roof, and it stood at the end of a small lane. Half the building extended over the edge of the Tor, supported by a maze-work of thick oak beams anchored in the cliff. Above an iron-banded door hung a brightly painted signboard showing an emerald-green dragon sleeping contentedly atop a treasure hoard.\nThe common room was well lit by oil lanterns and candles, bright cloths were spread across the tables, a polished wooden bar stood against one wall, a great fireplace was set against another, a board hung on a wall with the prices, and all the windows had shutters. The inn had a kitchen where the food was made. \nThere was a private dining chamber in the wing of the inn that jutted over the edge of the Tor. It had a window gazing out at the plains below the Tor and a small fireplace. Near the fireplace there was a heavy oaken table with a couple of chairs strewn about.\nUp in the attic, there was an assortment of weapons, armor, and traveling gear from back when Estah used to travel with the Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon.\nA side door led into the walled garden that Estah maintained behind the inn. The garden was large, over 100 feet (30.5 meters) wide, and had an assortment of plants and trees. On one of the walls there was a secret, small, overgrown wrought-iron gate that led into a narrow alleyway behind the inn. The shadowed alley led to a larger avenue."
