The '''Gallaway Trade Depot''' shop in [[Targos]] was a part of the prosperous '''Gallaway Trading Coster''' that operated in the [[Northwest Faer√ªn]] as early as the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Ye can find the trade depot at the top o' the cliffs, ye can. The strip of the girl there, Deirdre's got a heart like a fire, but ye should be able to find what ye need there. Just don't press her too hard or yell liable to catch trouble for your efforts.''|[[Firtha Kerdos]]}}

==Location==
The Gallaway Trade Depot stood atop a cliff in Targos, overlooking the town's docks and warehouses that belonged to the Gallaway Trading Coster. Its next door neighbor was the [[Weeping Widow Inn]].

==Interior==
[[File:Gallaway Trade Depot interior.png|thumb|305x305px]]
The Trade Depot in Targos was a sizable single-floor building with its interior filled with shelves, displays, crates, barrels, cupboards, and chests. All the filled with somewhat organized goods that the Gallaway Trading Coster had available for sale, from [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] to [[scroll]]s and cooking implements. A fanciful wardrobe stood on the opposite side from the main entrance, behind the counter. It was engraved with an image of a rearing [[lion]] and a cackling [[witch]].

==Services==
Gallaway Trading Coster was the main trading organization in the Ten Towns. It owned several warehouses in Targos's dock, and shipping crates found inside and in the Trade Depot bore trade seals of [[Bremen]] and [[Shaengarne Ford]]. The coaster exported ''[[potions of healing]]'' from [[Bryn Shander]], weapons from [[Luskan]], furs and pelts from [[Lonelywood]], alcohol, [[iron ration]]s, [[10-foot pole]]s, and [[rope]]s from other places.

The depo offered healing supplies such as bandages and cloth for sale. The arsenal available for purchase was varied, from mundane melee and ranged weapons to a selection of unique [[enchanted]] items.

==History==
The Gallaway Trading Coster was operated by the Gallaway family and brought to prominence by merchant [[Ilmus Gallaway]] of [[Easthaven]]. Over the years, the small caravan business grew to become a trading coster. By the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Rawleigh Gallaway]] led the family, inhered from his father, Ilmus. In turn, Rawleigh's daughter [[Deirdre Gallaway]] was put in charge of the company's operations in Targos, personally sent there by Ilmus so that the youth could prove herself. This time would become her biggest challenge as the trade was interrupted by attacks of the [[Legion of the Chimera]], and the coster's goods and lumber were confiscated by the [[Targos Guard]] to build the palisades and help protect Town. [[Jemeliah]] was one of the employees of the coster in Targos who was assigned the advisory job to Deirdre by her father as "one last favor" after serving the family's business for half of his life. Jemeliah did not approve of the town of Targos' actions and thought that the massive debt they racked up with Deirdre would never be paid off. Deirdre had a reputation of being a brash flame-headed whelp, and she received little respect from Lord [[Ulbrec Dinnesmore]]'s men.
