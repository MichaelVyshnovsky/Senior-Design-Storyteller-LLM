}}
'''Garmult's House of Mastery''' was an academy that specialized in tutoring pupils in how to improve their martial prowess and combat skills, run by the former [[gladiator]] [[Darbrand Garmult]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Additionally it served as a social club for the members of the [[Bannerless Legion]] crew.

==Services==
Garmult offered martial combat training to many Baldurian men-at-arms who could afford the fees. Many prospective warriors could find a willing sparring partner within.

Additionally, Garmult used the school to scout for prospective members of the Bannerless Legion. They worked with [[Dezri Lamouer]] to find skilled individuals who could work as mercenaries for their clientele.
