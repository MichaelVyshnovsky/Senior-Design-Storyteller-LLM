Garmults House of Mastery was an academy that specialized in tutoring pupils in how to improve their martial prowess and combat skills, run by the former gladiator Darbrand Garmult during the 15 century DR. Additionally it served as a social club for the members of the Bannerless Legion crew.
Garmult offered martial combat training to many Baldurian men-at-arms who could afford the fees. Many prospective warriors could find a willing sparring partner within.
Additionally, Garmult used the school to scout for prospective members of the Bannerless Legion. They worked with Dezri Lamouer to find skilled individuals who could work as mercenaries for their clientele.
