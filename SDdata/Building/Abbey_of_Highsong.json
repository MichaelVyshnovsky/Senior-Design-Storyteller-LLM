        "mainbody": "The '''Abbey of Highsong''' was a temple to [[Milil]] located northwest of the town of [[Nashkel]].",
        "History": "The temple was built by the [[Sorlyn]] priest [[Velmos Sonder]] after he acquired [[Wythyndle's Round Book]], ''circa'' [[1360 DR]]. It was built in an old country villa that once belonged to the [[Tharthyn]] family.\n\nThe abbey began to flourish a couple years after its opening, attracting many wealthy young folks from [[Amn]] and [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was the last known location of the ''Round Book'' that disappeared three years after the place's opening, seemingly stolen during Velmos' assassination."
