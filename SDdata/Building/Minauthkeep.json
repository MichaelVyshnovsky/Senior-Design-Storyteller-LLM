From a portal in Cormanthor leading to the Labyrinth, it was five days west to a small river, and from there, a days journey south to Minauthkeep.\nMinauthkeeps ruined structures and crumbling foundations were covered in green vines and included a collapsed iron gate. They were made to look abandoned despite being occupied.\nThe Minauthkeep castle had a secret chamber behind a bronze mask of Vhaeraun.\nMinauthkeep was settled by House Jaelre between 1322 DR and 1372 DR after their exodus from the Underdark. They desired to take over the ruined Elven Court and use its mythals to ward off enemies."
