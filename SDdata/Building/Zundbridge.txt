'''Zundbridge''' was a massive, squat bridge located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of [[Waterdeep]], where the [[Trade Way]] crossed the [[Dessarin River]]. The bridge was named after the wizard [[Zund]], who created it. As of [[1370 DR]], the bridge had held firm without repairs for more than ninety winters.

Waterdeep maintained a castle there on a rocky outcropping above the river gorge. The castle's outer wall protected a large area used to inspect caravans while the inner wall protected garrison buildings. The castle had three [[griffon]]s at its disposal.

Zund was said to have used a [[stone golem]] to build the bridge, and over the years many sought to find it and command it.{{Cite dragon/128/Welcome to Waterdeep}}
