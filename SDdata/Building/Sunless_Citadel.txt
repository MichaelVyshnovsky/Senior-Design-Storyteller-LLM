The '''Sunless Citadel''' was a once-proud fortress in the [[Crags]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] that fell into a rift in the ground in the midâ€“15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The citadel was built on the surface by an [[Ashardalon]]-worshiping sect of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that valued its privacy and defense. In the [[1451 DR|Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR]], the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] killed most of the cult members and plunged the fortress into a rift. Magical enchantments protected and preserved much of the citadel's structure from the event.

==Location==
The Sunless Citadel was once a secret stronghold located in the foothills northwest of [[Thundertree]], {{SI|7|mile|k|long=yes}} southwest of [[Oakhurst]]. It plunged into the earth when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted and threw [[Neverwinter]] into chaos.

==Inhabitants==
Following the [[Ruining]], and in the absence of its former inhabitants, the fortress was overrun by [[goblins]] from the [[Durbuluk]] tribe and [[kobolds]] who sought to challenge the goblins' rule over the fortress.
