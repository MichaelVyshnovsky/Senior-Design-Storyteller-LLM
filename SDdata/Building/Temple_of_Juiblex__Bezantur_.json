        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Juiblex''' in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]], was a place where cultists of [[Juiblex]] congregated. The temple was a rarity even within the \"City of a Thousand Temples\" as a place of worship dedicated to a [[demon lord]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in southeastern Bezantur at the edge of the main concentration of temples. It was just east of the [[Temple of Kossuth (Bezantur)|Temple of Kossuth]] and the [[Temple of Lolth (Bezantur)|Temple of Lolth]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was a tall and narrow pyramid that sat atop an underground chamber that seethed with masses of [[slime]]s and [[ooze]]s. A trio of [[granite]] obelisks inscribed with illegible runes surrounded the pyramid.",
        "Activities": "The temple provided a place for a mysterious renegade group of Thayans to honor Juiblex and the many slimy creatures affiliated with that demon lord.",
        "History": "In the late 1360s [[DR]], [[Zulkir]] [[Aznar Thrul]] (the [[Tharchion]] of the [[Priador]] and thus ruler of Bezantur) was suspicious of the cultists of Juiblex at this temple, but not yet overly concerned that they might be dangerous to his rule. Nevertheless, he had sent several spies to infiltrate the group, hoping to learn their motives and exert control over them. However, every one of these spies either defected to join the cult or disappeared entirely."
