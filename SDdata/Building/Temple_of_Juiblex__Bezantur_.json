        "mainbody": "The Temple of Juiblex in Bezantur, Thay, was a place where cultists of Juiblex congregated. The temple was a rarity even within the \"City of a Thousand Temples\" as a place of worship dedicated to a demon lord.\nThe temple was located in southeastern Bezantur at the edge of the main concentration of temples. It was just east of the Temple of Kossuth and the Temple of Lolth.\nThe temple was a tall and narrow pyramid that sat atop an underground chamber that seethed with masses of slimes and oozes. A trio of granite obelisks inscribed with illegible runes surrounded the pyramid.\nThe temple provided a place for a mysterious renegade group of Thayans to honor Juiblex and the many slimy creatures affiliated with that demon lord.\nIn the late 1360s DR, Zulkir Aznar Thrul (the Tharchion of the Priador and thus ruler of Bezantur) was suspicious of the cultists of Juiblex at this temple, but not yet overly concerned that they might be dangerous to his rule. Nevertheless, he had sent several spies to infiltrate the group, hoping to learn their motives and exert control over them. However, every one of these spies either defected to join the cult or disappeared entirely."
