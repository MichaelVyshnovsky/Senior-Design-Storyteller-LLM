'''Firefinger's Tower''' was the abode of [[Flammuldinath Thuldoum|Flammuldinath "Firefingers" Thuldoum]], a famous wizard in [[Thentia]].

==Location==
The Tower was in the north-eastern corner of Thentia, close to the city walls.

The Tower was built in a spiralling shape, and was brightly painted in red, yellow, and orange. When Flammuldinath was in the mood, he would alter the hues of his tower to amuse himself and the townsfolk.

==Defenses==
The Tower was protected by Flammuldinath's powerful ''[[arcane lock]]s'' as well as ''[[guards and wards]]''.
