Firefingers Tower was the abode of Flammuldinath "Firefingers" Thuldoum, a famous wizard in Thentia.
The Tower was in the north-eastern corner of Thentia, close to the city walls.
The Tower was built in a spiralling shape, and was brightly painted in red, yellow, and orange. When Flammuldinath was in the mood, he would alter the hues of his tower to amuse himself and the townsfolk.
The Tower was protected by Flammuldinaths powerful arcane locks as well as guards and wards.
