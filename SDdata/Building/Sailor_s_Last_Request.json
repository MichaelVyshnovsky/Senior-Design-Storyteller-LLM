        "Location": {
            "Atmosphere": "The small chapel was long since missing a front door, and served as a refuge to impoverished [[:category:sailors|sailors]], [[dove]] and [[seagull]]s. The floor was full of bird droppings, and the whole place smelt of [[fish]] and brine. \n\nThe place didn't have dedicated [[Church of Valkur|clergy members]] watching over it&mdash;just an old retired sailor named [[Olroy]] acting as its guard. The altar was an old broken-down table in a corner, full of offerings left over time by worshipers such as seashells, locks of hair, and mementos of strong sentimental value.\n\nThe temple to Valkur was often a loud and busy place, used by seafarers as a place to socialize and find new crew members. The deity didn't mind as it valued strength and actions over prayers."

        "History": "Before being a temple, the place was a small warehouse used to store salted fish."
