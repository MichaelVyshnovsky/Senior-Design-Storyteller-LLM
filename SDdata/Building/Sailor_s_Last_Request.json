        "mainbody": "he Sailors Last Request was a small chapel to Valkur located in Waterdeep during the 14 century DR.\nThe temple was located in front on the docks, in an old and small warehouse building nested on the corner of Dock Street and Odd Street. \nThe small chapel was long since missing a front door, and served as a refuge to impoverished sailors, dove and seagulls. The floor was full of bird droppings, and the whole place smelt of fish and brine. \nThe place didnt have dedicated clergy members watching over it&mdashjust an old retired sailor named Olroy acting as its guard. The altar was an old broken-down table in a corner, full of offerings left over time by worshipers such as seashells, locks of hair, and mementos of strong sentimental value.\nThe temple to Valkur was often a loud and busy place, used by seafarers as a place to socialize and find new crew members. The deity didnt mind as it valued strength and actions over prayers.\nBefore being a temple, the place was a small warehouse used to store salted fish."
