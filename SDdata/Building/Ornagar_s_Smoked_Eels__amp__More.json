        "mainbody": "Ornagars Smoked Eels & More was a cannery in the city of Ravens Bluff circa 1370 DR.\nThis store was situated in the Silverscales, a neighborhood in the Harbor District of Ravens Bluff.\nOrnagars Smoked Eels & More processed and canned a variety of seafood including fish, mussels, oysters, squid, and of course, eels. Despite being a seafood cannery, it was known locally for the pleasant smell of burning cherry wood. The cannery slowly smoked their eels before packaging in tightly sealed jars. This ensured their product remained edible as it was delivered throughout the Vast and as far north as the Moonsea."
