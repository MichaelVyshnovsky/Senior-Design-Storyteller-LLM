Council Hall was the monthly meeting place of the Royal Council of Aglarond, advisers to the Simbul, around 1368 DR.
This building was situated at an elevated position in Velprintalar, overlooking the rest of the city.
Council Hall was built in a typical Aglarondan style, being constructed of weathered wood and featuring steep roofs, chimneys and cupolas. Originally built to house but singular meeting room, the hall was expanded over the years until it contained many guest rooms, kitchens, and other rooms in addition to the meeting rooms.
