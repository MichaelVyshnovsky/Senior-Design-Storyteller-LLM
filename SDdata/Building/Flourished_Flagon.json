        "mainbody": "he Flourished Flagon was a tavern in Berdusk catering mostly to adventurers belonging to the shorter races of humanoids.\nThe tavern was located in the Castle Hill area, a block west of Twilight Hall at the north east corner of said block, just across the street from Athalankeir House.\nThe interior walls of the building were covered in paintings made by the taverns patrons that depicted adventurers standing over defeated monsters and enemies. These paintings typically represented the artists proudest moment of their adventuring careers.\nThe Flourished Flagon was a loud establishment where its patrons let off steam, singing, dancing, and throwing their cups at each other. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings made up the majority of the clientele, while elves and humans were made to feel not entirely welcome.\nThe Flourished Flagon was a drinking establishment.\nThe tavern was owned by multiple gnomes who all answered to the name Marklo.\nThe Marklos were rumored to offer banking services to preferred customers, and even fence stolen goods."
