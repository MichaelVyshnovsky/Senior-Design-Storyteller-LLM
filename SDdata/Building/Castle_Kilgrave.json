        "Location": "[[File:Castle Kilgrave.png|thumb|390x390px|''The location of Castle Kilgrave.'']]\nIt was built atop a hill situated within a valley in the [[Storm Horns]] mountain range.",
        "Structure": "The stone castle appeared as a squat square keep measuring {{SI|30|ft}} tall and {{SI|1000|ft|k}} along each side. It was three stories tall aboveground, with four circular towers that sat atop its corners and a single obelisk that served as a gatetower looming over its central gate.\n\nWithin the the keep's center was an inner courtyard  that surrounded a central audience hall.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "While it appeared as a typical squat stone fortress for much of its history, Bane briefly transformed Castle Kilgrave into an otherworldly fortress of some unknown black material marbled with red."
        },
        "Defenses": "Beyond its stone structure, Castle Kilgrave was defended in part by a shallow moat that surrounded its perimeter.",
        "History": "[[File:Castle Kilgrave 2.jpg|thumb|''One of Castle Kilgrave's spires.''|370x370px]]\nDuring the Time of Troubles in {{YearlinkName|1358}}, avatar of Bane took over the castle and reformed it as his own personal domain on [[Faerûn]], known as ''New Acheron''. He used [[spell shape]] magic to make it better resemble his own [[Temple of Suffering]] on his home plane of [[Acheron]].\n\nUsing some unknown means, along with the [[magic]]-nullifying effects of a [[hakeashar]], Bane managed to subdue and imprison the pure-energy form of [[Mystra]] within his New Acheron. While he originally sought to have the goddess of Magic join his alliance to overthrow the overgod [[Ao]], her refusal limited him to siphoning away her power over arcane magic.\n\nUnfortunately for Bane, Mystra [[Geas/Quest|compelled]] teenager [[Caitlan Moonsong]] to bring the [[mage]] [[Midnight]] and a group of worthy adventurers, a group that would include the priest [[Adon]], the mercenary [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], and a thief named [[Cyric]]; across Cormyr to Castle Kilgrave to free her essence from Bane's clutches. Armed with an amulet holding part of Mystra's essence, Midnight was able to ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' Bane's illusions over the castle. Mystra merged with Caitlan and defeated the Black Lord's avatar, forcing him to flee through a vortex as New Acheron slipped away from him.\n\nMystra attempted to ascend the [[Celestial Stairway]] but was obliterated by the god [[Helm]]. The ensuing explosion was leveled the entirety of Castle Kilgrave, leaving it little more than rubble and scattered crumbled walls atop its foundation. \n\nOver time, the landscape surrounding the became a wasteland of bubbling tar pits.  In the decade that followed, some adventurers attempted to explore the castle's underground levels to no avail. Those that returned in one piece with their psyches intact came back emptyhanded no richer for the risk they took.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The [[gnome]] scholar [[Nadul DaRoni]] of [[High Horn]] offered sketches of Castle Kilgrave, among other famous architectural landmarks, for the nominal fee of a single [[gold piece]] via [[Aurora's Emporium]]."
