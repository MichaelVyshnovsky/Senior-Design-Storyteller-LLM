        "mainbody": "Castle Kilgrave, also known for a time as New Acheron, that served as a fortress for the avatar of the god Bane during the Time of Troubles in the mid–14 century DR.\nthumb|390x390px|The location of Castle Kilgrave.\nIt was built atop a hill situated within a valley in the Storm Horns mountain range.\nThe stone castle appeared as a squat square keep measuring  tall and  along each side. It was three stories tall aboveground, with four circular towers that sat atop its corners and a single obelisk that served as a gatetower looming over its central gate.\nWithin the the keeps center was an inner courtyard  that surrounded a central audience hall.\nThe castle included numerous living quarters, a kitchen, feasthall, library and an audience hall that doubled as a throne room, among other locations.\nIts hallways were lined with marble columns, inlaid with gold, decorated with elaborately-woven rugs.\nWhile it appeared as a typical squat stone fortress for much of its history, Bane briefly transformed Castle Kilgrave into an otherworldly fortress of some unknown black material marbled with red.\nBeyond its stone structure, Castle Kilgrave was defended in part by a shallow moat that surrounded its perimeter.\nthumb|One of Castle Kilgraves spires.|370x370px\nDuring the Time of Troubles in , avatar of Bane took over the castle and reformed it as his own personal domain on Faerûn, known as New Acheron. He used spell shape magic to make it better resemble his own Temple of Suffering on his home plane of Acheron.\nUsing some unknown means, along with the magic-nullifying effects of a hakeashar, Bane managed to subdue and imprison the pure-energy form of Mystra within his New Acheron. While he originally sought to have the goddess of Magic join his alliance to overthrow the overgod Ao, her refusal limited him to siphoning away her power over arcane magic.\nUnfortunately for Bane, Mystra compelled teenager Caitlan Moonsong to bring the mage Midnight and a group of worthy adventurers, a group that would include the priest Adon, the mercenary Kelemvor Lyonsbane, and a thief named Cyric across Cormyr to Castle Kilgrave to free her essence from Banes clutches. Armed with an amulet holding part of Mystras essence, Midnight was able to dispel Banes illusions over the castle. Mystra merged with Caitlan and defeated the Black Lords avatar, forcing him to flee through a vortex as New Acheron slipped away from him.\nMystra attempted to ascend the Celestial Stairway but was obliterated by the god Helm. The ensuing explosion was leveled the entirety of Castle Kilgrave, leaving it little more than rubble and scattered crumbled walls atop its foundation. \nOver time, the landscape surrounding the became a wasteland of bubbling tar pits.  In the decade that followed, some adventurers attempted to explore the castles underground levels to no avail. Those that returned in one piece with their psyches intact came back emptyhanded no richer for the risk they took.\nThe gnome scholar Nadul DaRoni of High Horn offered sketches of Castle Kilgrave, among other famous architectural landmarks, for the nominal fee of a single gold piece via Auroras Emporium."
