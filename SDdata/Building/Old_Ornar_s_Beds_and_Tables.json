        "mainbody": "Old Ornars Beds and Tables was a furniture shop in Sundabar, owned and run by the elderly master-woodworker, Ornar Myntul, in the 14 century DR. \nFrom his shop, Ornar would import and sell master-crafted beds and tables, albeit at a much more reasonable price. While a particularly plain piece would sell for about 30 gp and an elaborate canopied bed would fetch several thousand, most of Ornars pieces cost less than 8 gp, while his most expensive bed was 18 gp."
