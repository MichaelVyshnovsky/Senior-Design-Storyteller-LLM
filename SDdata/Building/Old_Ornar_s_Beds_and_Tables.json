        "mainbody": "'''Old Ornar's Beds and Tables''' was a furniture shop in [[Sundabar]], owned and run by the elderly master-woodworker, [[Ornar Myntul]], in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. \n\nFrom his shop, Ornar would import and sell master-crafted beds and tables, albeit at a much more reasonable price. While a particularly plain piece would sell for about 30 [[gp]] and an elaborate canopied bed would fetch several thousand, most of Ornar's pieces cost less than 8 [[gp]], while his most expensive bed was 18 gp."
