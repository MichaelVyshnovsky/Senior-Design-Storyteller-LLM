The Academy of Mentalist Study was a famous magic school in Eileanar that operated for the entire lifetime of the enclave.
The college focused on the magic of the mentalist field. Just before Karsuss Folly, the Dean of Teachers, Zucchi, taught alongside a body of teachers who each specialized in a particular area. They were made up of  Czarnieck (mind control), Flaugergues (illusions), Lycanter (telepathy), Siculus (illusions), Addington (divination), Midoria (information gathering), Grenoble (divination), and Alexander (necromancy).
The Academy was founded by Karsus as part of the grand opening of his enclave in , with the intention of drawing people in to populate his new city.
The most famous student was the arcanist Shadow, who produced a revolutionary and outrageous piece of work that accurately detailed the mechanics of the planes and demiplanes. When it became known that he had studied at the Academy the student body increased by 30% for the next five years, and the college added another two levels to the main structure in addition to purchasing the neighboring block in order to build dormitories.
