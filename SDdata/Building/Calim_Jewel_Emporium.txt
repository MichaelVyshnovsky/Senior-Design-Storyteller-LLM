The Calim Jewel Emporium was a jewelers shop located in Little Calimshan within the Outer City of Baldurs Gate.
In addition to being the home to perhaps the most well-regarded Baldurian jeweler of the late 15 century, the emporium served as a forum for local agents of criminal organization known as the Guild. The emporium was owned by the Guild Kingpin of Little Calimshan, Rilsa Rael. She used her establishment as a headquarters for guild members and to host public events for the people of her neighborhood and the rest of the Outer City.
In addition to its civic-and-criminal-oriented activities, the emporium functioned as any other jewelers business â€” with the distinction of having sterling reputation. Its lapidary was among the Gates finest and it was considered one of the best places to sell stolen gems and jewels.
