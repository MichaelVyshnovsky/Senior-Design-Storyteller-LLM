        "mainbody": "The Burning Wizard was a bustling tavern found in the town of Beregost, considered a favorite among the locals. It was somewhat unique in that its interior decor was largely composed of small trinkets and ornaments that were donated by regular patrons.\nThe exterior of the tavern had no sign, but had a hitching post that was often quite crowded. This later changed. In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, the tavern had a sign of a stylized sun on a blue background.\nThe tavern was staffed by acolytes of Lathander from the nearby Song of the Morning temple, who were trained to engage in pleasant conversation and entertain the taverns patrons.\nNo food was served in the Wizard, though runners were available to fetch platters of food from local Beregostan inns.\nThe Burning Wizard was the only tavern in town. It earned its name from the tale of the mage Ulcaster, and his school of magic that was founded sometime before the 12 century DR near Beregost. As Ulcaster grew in power, his academy was set ablaze by the group of Calishite wizards.\nSometime before the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR the thief Zhurlong came into the possession of one set of worn whispers. He then proceeded to lose them to some hobgoblins just south of Beregost and ended up in the Burning Wizard.\nIn 1368 DR the bard Garrick waited outside the tavern to hire some mercenaries for his employer Silke Rosena."
