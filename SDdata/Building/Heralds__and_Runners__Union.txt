The Heralds and Runners Union was the guildhall for the messengers and heralds in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The guildhall was located along Wall Street in southwest Daggerford next to the barracks.
The structure stood three stories tall. A platform was found on the roof which added to the height of the building. Birds coups were kept atop the platform and were used for messenger birds.
