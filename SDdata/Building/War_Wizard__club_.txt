The War Wizard was a private club for mages found in a city in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR. It was named after the War Wizards of Cormyr.
It stood near a large statue of a victorious King Azoun Obarskyr IV. The signboard outside displayed a familiar-looking wizard wearing a pointed hat and waving a wand.The city in the Cormyr part of The Grand Tour is actually unnamed. A likely candidate is Suzail based on the presence of the statue.
It was an opulent place with high-backed chairs around low tables, with tapestries of great mages adorning the walls.
Here, traveling mages could stop and relax, catch up, and enjoy exotic beverages, some foaming with tendrils in them.
The only club where the doorman requires old, balding, and bearded for entry.
Circa 1369 DR, during the time when King Azoun IV lay dying during the abraxus affair, Elminster and Presto teleported into the city and stopped by the War Wizard to meet travelogue writer Volothamp Geddarm for a geography lesson for Presto. Afterward, Ed Greenwood and Julia Martin crept in to pressure Volo to give up the manuscript to Volos Guide to All Things Magical. Also there in conversation with another mage was the Halruaan wizard Dwalimar Omen.
