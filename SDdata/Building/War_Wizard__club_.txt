The '''War Wizard''' was a private club for mages found in a city in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]]. It was named after the [[War Wizards]] of Cormyr.{{Cite comic/Forgotten Realms: The Grand Tour}}

==Location==
It stood near a large statue of a victorious King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]. The signboard outside displayed a familiar-looking [[wizard]] wearing a pointed hat and waving a [[wand]].The city in the Cormyr part of ''The Grand Tour'' is actually unnamed. A likely candidate is Suzail based on the presence of the statue.

==Interior==
It was an opulent place with high-backed chairs around low tables, with tapestries of great mages adorning the walls.

===Atmosphere===
Here, traveling mages could stop and relax, catch up, and enjoy exotic beverages, some foaming with tendrils in them.

==History==
[[File:War Wizard club interior.jpg|thumb|250px|''The only club where the doorman requires 'old, balding, and bearded' for entry.'']]
''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], during the time when King Azoun IV lay dying during the [[abraxus affair]], [[Elminster]] and [[Presto]] teleported into the city and stopped by the War Wizard to meet travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] for a geography lesson for Presto. Afterward, [[Ed Greenwood]] and [[Julia Martin]] crept in to pressure Volo to give up the manuscript to ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]''. Also there in conversation with another mage was the [[Halruaa]]n wizard [[Dwalimar Omen]].
