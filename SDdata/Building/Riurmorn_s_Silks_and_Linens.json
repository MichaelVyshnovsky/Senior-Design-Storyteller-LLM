        "mainbody": "Riurmorns Silks and Linens was a shop in Moontassel that sold textiles imported from Sembia as well as silk from the east during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The shop also sold carpets and linens. One was able to get a good deal on carpets if they did not mind the bloodstains. The establishment was run by Riurmorn, who was secretly an agent for the Cult of the Dragon."
