The '''Red Rock''' was a stone and wood inn located in [[Dagger Falls]] run by the [[half-elven]] ex-minstrel [[Kessla]].  

==Structure==
The taproom of the Red Rock was illuminated by magical globes of light rather than candles, courtesy of Kessla's magic. 

==History==
The Red Rock survived inspections from the [[Zhentarim]] and countless brawls that would erupt inside. Despite this, it was burned to the ground by an army of [[orc]]s. The Lord of Daggerdale [[Randal Morn]] did not have enough money to rebuild the inn, though some adventurers lent money to Kessla for restoration before [[1367 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
Kessla was assisted by a stable boy named [[Orthran]] and two waitresses, [[Larstiira]] and [[Jandylgrae]].
