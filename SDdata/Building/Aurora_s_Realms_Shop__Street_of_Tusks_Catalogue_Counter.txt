'''Aurora's Realms Shop, Street of Tusks Catalogue Counter''' was an outlet of the [[Aurora's Emporium]] retail chain in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of six such outlets in the city.<ref group="note" name="error">On page 120 the sourcebook ''[[Volo's Guide to Waterdeep]]'', the Trades Ward catalogue counter is given the name "High Road." Since both [[City of Splendors (boxed set)|''City of Splendors'']] and ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' list that as the name of the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] catalogue counter, this can be considered an error. Therefore, all information given on page 120 can be considered relevant to this store instead.
