        "mainbody": "'''Tyryl's Tankards''' was a tavern that was established in [[Myth Drannor]] during the midâ€“7{{th}} century [[DR]]. Owned and run by the successful [[half-elven]] [[wizard]] [[Liusaidh Dyaena]], it catered to the young, would-be spellcasters that hailed from the eclectic [[Dlabraddath]] district of the city.",
        "Structure": "It comprised a single-story structure built amongst the trees that overlooked the southern end of [[The Manysteps]], in the southern end of the city.",
        "Services": "The tavern catered to the students of the [[arcane arts]] that attended the nearby [[Six Tyryl Towers|Tyryl Towers]]. As such it was ''[[ward]]ed'' from magic that exceeded minor illusions and [[cantrip]]s, protecting its clientele from those young [[mage]]s who may have had one too many to drink.",
        "History": "Tyryl's Tankards was established during or just before the {{YearlinkName|650}}, replacing the older and seemingly less-refined \"Bell's Ringing\" tavern."
