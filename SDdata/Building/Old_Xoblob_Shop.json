        "mainbody": "The '''Old Xoblob Shop''' was a curiosity shop in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It was famous for the stuffed [[beholder]] that hung above its front window by the main counter.",
        "Location": "The shop was located at the corner of [[Zastrow Street]] and [[Fillet Lane]], two doors down from the local outlet of [[Aurora's Emporium]].",
        "Structure": "The shop was located in the ground floor of a tall stone-and-timber building. A broad stair led to the second floor and a hidden stair led to the basement.\n\nThe second floor was mostly empty, but the ceiling was 60 feet high. A one-way ''[[gate]]'' from the second level of [[Undermountain]] was connected to this floor of the building. A narrow flight of stairs led to the third floor.\n\nThe third floor contained the proprietor's private chambers as well as two guestrooms. There was a bower for relaxation and an [[herb]] garden on the roof.\n\nThe basement level was a high-ceilinged wine cellar with huge [[cask]]s and a kitchen. It also had a connection to Waterdeep's sewers.\n\nThe building had a few secret areas where persons could hide from unwanted followers or the law itself.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Customers coming from the front door or from the second-floor ''gate'' were received with a smile by the proprietor."
        },
        "Services": "The Old Xoblob Shop was famous for carrying items that were not available from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]. The owners bought and sold all sorts of trinkets, including relics from all over [[Toril]] and even other [[:Category:Planets|worlds]].\n\nThe shop also sold battle trophies from adventurers coming from Undermountain.",
        "Activities": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the shop's owner acted as a spy for the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. A ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' sensor was installed in the central eye of the stuffed beholder that showed the shop's interior to a mirror in [[Xanathar]]'s hideout in [[Skullport]].",
        "History": "The shop was named after the beholder that was killed by the first proprietor, [[Dandalus Ruell]]. It was unclear whether [[Old Xoblob]] was actually the name of the beholder or just the part of it that Dandalus could pronounce.\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], during [[Goldenight]], one of the festivals of [[Waukeentide]], four [[aurumvorax]] found their way out of [[Undermountain]] through the shop and caused the death of several patrons of the neighboring [[Purple Palace]]. When reporting the incident to the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], Dandalus suggested that the creatures' ability to breach through the shop's magical defenses constituted foul play.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the shop was purchased by a [[deep gnome]] who had survived the detonation of a [[gas spore]] and had acquired some of the mannerisms of a beholder, such as the drive to establish a lair. After unsuccessful attempts at renaming the shop, the gnome instead changed his own name to [[Xoblob]] and restored the shop's original name.",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Dandalus Ruell]], the original owner, who loved to tell visitors about his victory over the beholder.\n* [[Arathka Ruell]], shopkeeper and Dandalus's wife.\n* [[Xoblob]], the shop's owner as of [[1492 DR]].{{Waterdeep-time}}"
