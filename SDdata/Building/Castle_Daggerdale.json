        "mainbody": "Castle Daggerdale was a keep that once belonged to the Morn family for several centuries before being abandoned by the mid-14 century DR, and rebuilt in the early 15 century DR.\nCastle Daggerdale was built on the edge of the Dagger Hills, near the headwaters of River Ashaba, across a tributary east from the Tethyamar Trail.\nCastle Daggerdale belonged to Randal Morns family, the leader of anti-Zhentarim resistance in DaggerdaleÂ’. The castle was left undamaged but gutted by fires and abandoned, however, Randal Morns people often used the old castle as a camp, using its old tunnels and basements to escape the Zhents.\nIn the early 15 century DR, Daggerdale fell under the rule of Barathal Cormaeril, Randal Morns great-grandnephew. In the , Castle Daggerdale was rebuilt by Domavos Cormaeril, Barathals father, using the Cormaeril familys money to further accentuate their rulership of the land. In the , Neranya Cormaeril, Barathals sister, was presumed killed outside Castle Daggerdale. Her posse was slaughtered by lycanthrope that recently started plaguing Daggerdale. Neranyas body was never found. By the  Daggerdale became dangerously infested with lycanthropes, leading to Barathal Cormaeril becoming besieged by the children of the black blood and subsequent control of the region beginning to deteriorate.\nSome local rumors told stories of the Morn family treasures hidden behind bricked-up tunnels in the castles basements."
