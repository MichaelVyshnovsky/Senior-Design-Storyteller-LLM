'''The Worried Wyvern''' was an average-quality [[inn]] located in the town of [[Hill's Edge]] in the [[Sunset Vale]].

==Interior==
The uppermost floor comprised interconnected suites of rooms, while the ground floor had a nice dining room.

==Services==
The inn offered a [[pigeon|messenger pigeon]] service for sending communications and errands to [[Iriaebor]].

The Worried Wyvern was perhaps best known for its food. Morning and [[Hours of the day|Highsun]] meals often included [[bacon]], [[sausage]], and toasted [[bread]] with drippings, as well as a signature [[omelet]] of [[asparagus]] and [[spice]]d [[fish]]. Evening meals featured roasted meats and dishes like [[chicken|chicken liver]] with [[mushroom]] sauce or [[green pepper]]s stuffed with [[rice]], [[tomato]], and ground meat.

==History==
The inn was fairly new as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], at which time it was regarded by [[Volo]] as the most average inn in town. It was known as a clean, safe, pleasant, and overall unexciting place to stay. The otherwise very good experience of eating in the dining room was marred by a particularly bad [[harp]]ist.
