Firefinger was an ancient Chultan signal tower that survived the ages, until at least the late 15 century DR.
It was located in the northern jungles of Chult on the eastern side of the River Tiryki.
The tower stood 300 feet (91.4 meters) tall. It walls were steep and very difficult to climb by hand. A few crumbling ladders were situated around its exterior, though they were quite precarious.
