'''Firefinger''' was an ancient [[Chultan]] signal tower that survived the ages, until at least the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It was located in the northern jungles of Chult on the eastern side of the [[River Tiryki]].

==Structure==
The tower stood 300 feet (91.4 meters) tall. It walls were steep and very difficult to climb by hand. A few crumbling ladders were situated around its exterior, though they were quite precarious.

==Activities==
During the prosperous years of [[Chult]]an civilization, Firefinger was used to communication from one settlement to another. Colored flames were lit at night and colored smoke was created during the day.

==History==
The blue fires of the [[Spellplague]] destroyed many towers similar to Firefinger during the late 14{{th}} century. 

==Inhabitants==
As of the year of the ''[[death curse]]'', [[giant spider]]s and [[stirge]]s took over the tower's lower floors,
