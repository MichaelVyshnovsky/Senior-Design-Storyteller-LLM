The '''Pushy Pixie''' was a friendly and welcoming tavern located in [[Velarsburg]], [[Harrowdale]], during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The rustic alehouse was extremely popular among the local farmers and woodsmen, who were entertained by lowbrow jokes, risque dancers, and crude pranks. Fights were common within the Pixie, and just about every night included pieces of broken furniture that were easily replaced by local woodworkers. 

Two [[priest]]s from the [[Temple of the Harvest Moon]] were regularly stationed in the tavern during the evenings to tend to the wounded.

While the dancers in the Pixie were not particularly talented, once a month a group of traveling priests of [[Sune]] known as the [[Flametresses]] would stop within the tavern and demonstrate their acrobatic abilities. Locals throughout Velarsburg would pack the tavern on these nights.
