        "mainbody": "The Garrison of Surcross in Thay was a building that housed the living portion of the citys Thayan soldiers as of the late 15 century DR.\nIt was the second-most fortified building in the city (after the Tombstone) and was a long hall of reinforced, heavy stone.\nThe building contained many inner passages, rooms, and chambers comprising the communal barracks. Each room of the barracks could house dozens of soldiers, who were segregated by race (into humans, gnolls, orcs, half-orcs, and \"other\") but not segregated by gender. These barracks were simple, often including not more than a footlocker and a cot for each soldier. The exception was a single, opulent room that served as the barracks for a contingent of warlocks known as the Sunmasters, who had wardrobes, luxurious mattresses, thick carpets, and fine food and wine.\nThe structure included a main hall, at the end of which were a series of teleportation circles that allowed the troops to instantly travel to the Tombstone, the Gates of Bone, or any of the five Fingers of Szass Tam.\nUndead guards watched the garrisons entrances and did not allow entry to anyone who did not have a pass or a uniform, either of a Thayan soldier or a Red Wizard."
