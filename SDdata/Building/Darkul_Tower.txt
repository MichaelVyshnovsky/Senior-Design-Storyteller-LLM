'''Darkul Tower''' was the residence of [[Nusair Darkul]] in [[Bezantur]].{{cite book/Realms of the Dragons II/The Book Dragon|149-150}} a room devoted to a ''[[crystal ball]]'', and a library. The latter was perhaps the largest room in the tower, with a fireplace, a rug, an oaken table, and red tapestries covering every wall that had no bookshelves.
