'''Taneth's Feasthall''', also often referred to as '''Taneth's Festhall''', or simply '''Taneth's''', was a notable [[festhal]]l in [[Suzail]], the capital city of [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Taneth's Feasthall stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], on a street that crossed the [[Court Close]] that laid to the west of the establishment. Travelers who walked along the Court Close from the Promenade moving south needed to turn east once they passed [[Zhaelun's Stockyard]]. Then, moving east past the stockyard and the next two buildings, they reached the [[Mare's Tail]] tavern on the street's northern side. Across from it, to the south, stood Taneth's. The renowned [[Silver Cord Theatre]] stood nearby the festhall.
