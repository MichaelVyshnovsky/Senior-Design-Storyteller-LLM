Taneths Feasthall, also often referred to as Taneths Festhall, or simply Taneths, was a notable festhall in Suzail, the capital city of Cormyr, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Taneths Feasthall stood two blocks south from Suzails grand Promenade, on a street that crossed the Court Close that laid to the west of the establishment. Travelers who walked along the Court Close from the Promenade moving south needed to turn east once they passed Zhaeluns Stockyard. Then, moving east past the stockyard and the next two buildings, they reached the Mares Tail tavern on the streets northern side. Across from it, to the south, stood Taneths. The renowned Silver Cord Theatre stood nearby the festhall.
