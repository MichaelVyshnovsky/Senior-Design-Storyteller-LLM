        "mainbody": "he Spires of the Morning was a temple to Lathander in the Castle Ward near the northern spur of Mount Waterdeep in Waterdeep. \nBuilt of pink marble, this three-story cathedral was capped by seven spires of copper, gold, and silver that gleamed with the reflected glory of dawns first light.\nThe Spires of the Morning was led by High Radiance Ghentilara, as of 1374 DR and her ambitious underling Prior Athosar. More than 300 clerics of the Morninglord were based at the temple, most of them housed within a few blocks of the cathedral.\nIn addition to the clergy, the Spires of the Morning was an important base for the Order of the Aster. \nConstructed in 998 DR, the earliest construction on this site was a temple and monastery of Lathander located originally outside the city. \nThirteen years later in the Year of the Defiant Mountain (1011 DR), the Spires of Morning was dedicated.  \nIn 1101 DR, it became a part of the city when the walls were expanded to contain it and provide more room for the growing population.\nIt was destroyed by fire in 1345 DR during the Night of Temple Fires, but was rebuilt within a year."
