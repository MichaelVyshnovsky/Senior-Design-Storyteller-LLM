The '''Falling Star Tavern''' was a drinking establishment located in the port city of [[Khaerbaal]] in [[Halruaa]].

==Atmosphere==
The rowdy tavern was located in the city's docks next to a busy fishery. The tavern was popular spot among the young men in training of the [[House Jordain]] to blow off steam in bar brawls. In contrast to pugilism, verbal battles were just as common as debating was one of the jordaini's many skills. Among other entertainment provided by the drinking establishment were regular [[bard]]ic performances. However, they did not take place daily.

Members of the Halruaan navy, adorned in blue-green uniforms, and various local militia groups, were a big share of the Falling Star's clientele. Pirates frequented the establishment, but they tended to keep a low profile. As duels were popular in Khaerbaal, folk tended not to poke their noses in other people's personal business. And in case duels did happen, the Falling Star kept the alley behind the tavern free of garbage and debris.

Merchants, blacksmiths, [[Dwarf|dwarven]] miners, and many other locals could be seen imbibing the tavern's liquid dinner. Halruaan [[golden wine]] was a popular drink, served in [[silver]] [[decanter]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, young jordains [[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]] and [[Themo]] visited the tavern after a murder of a classmate by Halruaan [[Inquisitrix]] [[Kiva]]. Themo started a big tavern brawl to vent out grief and frustration, while Matteo subdued his [[Northlander|Northman]] friend. Matteo paid for the damages and quickly befriended a Halruaan house [[mage]] after buying him a jug of [[wine]].
