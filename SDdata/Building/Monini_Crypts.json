        "mainbody": "The Monini Crypts was a mausoleum in which the Monini family of Neverwinter were interred.\nThe Crypt was located in the Craftsmans Rest area of Neverwinters Neverdeath Graveyard. Following the great upheavals of the land during the Ruining, access to the Crypts was difficult and required finding and traversing a tunnel through the cliffs.\nIn the , members of the Cult of the Dragon entered the Monini Crypts in search of the knowledge to gain access to Azharzel, a blue dragon sealed within the Waterclock Guilds Crypts long before by Romani Monini. At that same time, Romanis descendant, Zami Monini, entered the crypt alongside scholar Tristopher Chettlebell to learn more about her family history. The pair were attacked by the Cultists, who captured Zami and locked her in a sarcophagus. Meanwhile, Tristopher escaped and, confused about the cultists motivations after no ransom demands were made, sought help from an adventurer to rescue Zami."
