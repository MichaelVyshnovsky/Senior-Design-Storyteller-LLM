        "mainbody": "The '''Thunder Stone''' was a mysterious rock planted in the ground that was the figurative and literal center of the town of [[Thunderstone]].",
        "Description": "The Stone was a three-foot-wide rock, the type of stone not matching any natural formations within miles of the town. It appeared to be completely mundane and non-magical.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Local legend had it that the Thunder Stone was magically transported from the tallest mountain of the [[Thunder Peaks]] and placed in the then-unmarked wilderness. The village of Thunderstone was then built around the rock.\n\nIt was believed to contain magical powers, and bestow good luck on those who kissed the Stone before heading on a risky venture.\n\nThe [[Mulmaster]] [[wizard]] [[Tiztor]] the Great had an obsession about the Stone, and believed that it simply required the right [[command word]] to unlock its fantastical magical powers. He briefly visited Thunderstone in [[1369 DR]] to investigate the site."
