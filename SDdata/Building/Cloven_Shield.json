        "mainbody": "The Cloven Shield was an inn and tavern in Marsember, Cormyr, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe tavern was situated on the island in the central southeast of Marsember and close to the sea.\nIts sign was a shield broken in two.\nPatrons found a place designed for drinking and partying into the late hours. It was used by adventurers and mercenaries as well as those looking to hire them, often unsavory customers representing the Zhentarim, the Cult of the Dragon, and factions in Thay. Thus, fights and brawls broke out regularly, often late at night.\nEven though the place was noisy, the establishment offered fair quality food at a cheap price. And while one would not likely sleep the night through, renting a room and trying to was cheap enough to be worth it to some.\nThe large rooms at the rear could house large groups and could be rented for 10 gp per night, including stabling and ordinary evening meals for nine people."
