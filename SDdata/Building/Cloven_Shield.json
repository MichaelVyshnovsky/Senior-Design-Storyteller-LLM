        "mainbody": "The '''Cloven Shield''' was an inn and tavern in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The tavern was situated on the island in the central southeast of Marsember and close to the sea.",
        "Structure": "Its sign was a shield broken in two.",
        "Atmosphere": "Patrons found a place designed for drinking and partying into the late hours. It was used by [[adventurers]] and [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] as well as those looking to hire them, often unsavory customers representing the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and factions in [[Thay]]. Thus, fights and brawls broke out regularly, often late at night.\n\nEven though the place was noisy, the establishment offered fair quality food at a cheap price. And while one would not likely sleep the night through, renting a room and trying to was cheap enough to be worth it to some.",
        "Prices": "The large rooms at the rear could house large groups and could be rented for 10 [[gp]] per night, including stabling and ordinary evening meals for nine people."
