It featured a bountiful vegetable garden and vast hunting grounds.\nAs of the early 1490s DR, the Silmerhelve family visited Helvenblade House about a half a dozen times a year.\nLocal legend stated that Helvenblade House was protected by what was perceived as the Silmerhelve family ghost. This guardian spirit was in fact the bronze dragon Umsheryoth, a long-time ally of the Waterdhavian family.\nThe noble estate was maintained by a staff of caretakers that lived on the grounds year-round."
