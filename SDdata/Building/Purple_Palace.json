        "Structure": "The building was four stories high.",
        "Interior": "Described by [[Volo]] as \"the closest thing Waterdeep has to a [[Calishite]] silks-boudoir\", the Purple Palace was a luxurious place of soft carpets, countless cushions, lavender-hued [[silk]] draperies and gauzy hangings, which were strongly perfumed.",
        "Services": "Companionship here was pricy, but said to be very good. They also sold a [[spice]]d [[wine]] that was tinted purple.",
        "History": "The Purple Palace was established before [[1357 DR]] and was in operation through the mid-1360s DR.\n\nTragedy struck on [[Tarsakh 5]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, during celebrations for [[Goldenight]] as part of [[Waukeentide]], when the companions were covered in no more than [[gold]] dust. That night, four [[aurumvorax]] left [[Undermountain]] through the [[Old Xoblob Shop]], then burst into the Purple Palace. They slew four of the festhall girls and three patrons before they were subdued. It was unclear if the beasts came at [[Halaster]]'s bidding or by chance, but the shop owner [[Dandalus Ruell]] couldn't explain how they escaped its magical safeguards, leading the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] to suspect sabotage. The victims' families and the festhall were given the aurumvorax hides, but it was meager compensation.\n\nIt was still in business by [[1373 DR]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The proprietress of the Purple Palace was [[Tathla Nightstar|Tathla \"Flamehair\" Nightstar]], a famed courtesan of [[Calimshan]].\n\nKnown courtesans at the Purple Palace were:\n* [[Dessra of the Dark Desires]], a famous courtesan\n* [[Naneethil of the Sword Tattoo]], a famous courtesan\n* [[Aletha Samprava|Aletha]] and [[Jhoysil Samprava]], twin sisters and secret contacts for the [[Red Sashes]]\n\nNotable guests included:\n* [[Sammereza Sulphontis|Sammereza \"Sammer\" Sulphontis]], a merchant and [[Masked Lord]] of Waterdeep, stayed at the Purple Palace whenever he was in the city"
