They also sold a spiced wine that was tinted purple.\nThe Purple Palace was established before 1357 DR and was in operation through the mid-1360s DR.\nTragedy struck on Tarsakh 5 in the , during celebrations for Goldenight as part of Waukeentide, when the companions were covered in no more than gold dust. That night, four aurumvorax left Undermountain through the Old Xoblob Shop, then burst into the Purple Palace. They slew four of the festhall girls and three patrons before they were subdued. It was unclear if the beasts came at Halasters bidding or by chance, but the shop owner Dandalus Ruell couldnt explain how they escaped its magical safeguards, leading the City Watch to suspect sabotage. The victims families and the festhall were given the aurumvorax hides, but it was meager compensation.\nIt was still in business by 1373 DR.\nThe proprietress of the Purple Palace was Tathla \"Flamehair\" Nightstar, a famed courtesan of Calimshan.\nKnown courtesans at the Purple Palace were\n* Dessra of the Dark Desires, a famous courtesan\n* Naneethil of the Sword Tattoo, a famous courtesan\n* Aletha and Jhoysil Samprava, twin sisters and secret contacts for the Red Sashes\nNotable guests included\n* Sammereza \"Sammer\" Sulphontis, a merchant and Masked Lord of Waterdeep, stayed at the Purple Palace whenever he was in the city"
