It was old and run-down.\nThe outpost served as a place where visiting shadovar would stay. The dark creepers would also accept messages for the Netherese.\nBy the , the shadovar had to contend with subversive actions against her embassy by the Thayan outpost in Evernight, although the citys Tribunal forbade this from escalating into open conflict.\nThe building was managed by the dark creepers and dark stalkers of the Glumguts family. This included their leader (Blackclaw), his son (Blackcut), and other extended relations (e.g., Thrax and Vynnia). In addition to their duties to their Netherese employers, the Glumguts were known to rob visitors to Evernight&mdashespecially living individuals who seemed unfamiliar with the Shadowfell&mdashand to attack travelers along the Shadowfell Road.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the Shadovar Ambassador was Kaross."
