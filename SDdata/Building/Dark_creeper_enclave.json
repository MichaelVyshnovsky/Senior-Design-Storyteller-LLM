        "mainbody": "The '''dark creeper enclave''', also known as the '''Shadovar Embassy''', was a large manor in [[Evernight]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it served as a consulate for the [[Netheril#Empire_of_Shadows|Empire of Netheril]] as well as the home of the [[Glumguts]] family of [[dark one]]s who maintained the building on behalf of the Netherese.",
        "Location": "It was located on the south side of the city adjacent to [[Graveyard (Evernight)|the Graveyard]].",
        "Structure": "The manor was one of the largest residences in the city. It was old and run-down.",
        "Services": "The outpost served as a place where visiting [[shadovar]] would stay. The [[dark creeper]]s would also accept messages for the Netherese.",

        "Inhabitants": "The building was managed by the dark creepers and [[dark stalker]]s of the Glumguts family. This included their leader ([[Blackclaw (dark stalker)|Blackclaw]]), his son ([[Blackcut]]), and other extended relations (e.g., [[Thrax]] and [[Vynnia]]). In addition to their duties to their Netherese employers, the Glumguts were known to rob visitors to Evernight&mdash;especially living individuals who seemed unfamiliar with the Shadowfell&mdash;and to attack travelers along the [[Shadowfell Road]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Shadovar Ambassador was [[Kaross]]."
