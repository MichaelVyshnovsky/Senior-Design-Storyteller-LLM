The Old Plough was an inn and tavern located in Daerlun, Sembia, circa the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. It was the place that farmers typically stayed when they came to town on business. It was quiet, neglected, and dull, just as its name suggested, but that sometimes suited people who needed to lay low for a while.
