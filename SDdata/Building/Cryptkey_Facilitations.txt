Cryptkey Facilitations was a business in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
Cryptkey Facilitations was a two-story establishment with an expansive basement, operating in fair condition. The building was heavily guarded by undead creatures, including a formidable skull-headed ettin zombie and a swarm of crawling claws.
To preserve their inventory of corpses prior to reanimation, Cryptkey Facilitations utilized a cool basement and sub-basement, extending the storage space beneath its modest two-story exterior.
Cryptkey Facilitations primary service lay in the procurement and preparation of corpses, which they carefully stitched and mended as necessary to supply high-quality bodies for reanimation. Utilizing spells such as Nulathoes ninemen and preserve dead, the organization ensured that each corpse was in optimal condition for necromantic purposes. They maintained close associations with figures like Mhaug and Dalagor the Cold.
In addition to providing bodies for reanimation, Cryptkey Facilitations offered a highly specialized, though costly, exhumation service. For those with the means to pay, the organization retrieved the remains of specific individuals—often heroes or well-known figures—from Waterdeeps City of the Dead. Access to these remains was enabled by a network of concealed passages and gates, allowing for clandestine entry and egress. However, due to the expense involved and the high demand for cheap labor in Skullport, this service was infrequently requested. The cost of recovering such a body varied widely, from hundreds to thousands of gold pieces, influenced by the nature of the burial and circumstances surrounding the individuals death.
Cryptkey Facilitations was run by a group of thieves and necromancers who profited by plundering crypts and graves within the City of the Dead. The organizations personnel typically numbered around twelve at any given time, each member wearing stylized masks to obscure their identities and maintaining a stoic silence. Circa 1370 DR, the operation was led by Jasmarn Shadewidow, a reserved and introspective woman of notable necromantic skill.
