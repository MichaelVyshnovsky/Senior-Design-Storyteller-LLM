        "mainbody": "The '''Tent of the Bows and Quivers''', or '''''nom-satakon erughe''''' in [[Chuchian]], was the palace compound that served as the headquarters of [[Chuqali Shilai]], the ''qaghan'' of the [[Fankiang]] tribe, in the city of [[Li-Raz]]. It was considered the grandest building in all the [[Plain of Horses]].",
        "Description": "The compound comprised four buildings made of red brick, each standing three stories high. Each had a different function. The first building was Shilai's living quarters. The second building housed meeting rooms and spaces for receiving visitors. The third building contained the ''qaghan''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> throne room and held his [[silver]]-plated treasures, with [[bow]]s and [[quiver]]s of [[arrow]]s on one side and [[saddle]]s and [[shield]]s on the other. Finally, the fourth building stabled a herd of white [[camel]]s, which were considered sacred, as well as the large white cart that transported Shilai's mobile personal [[yurt]]. The yurt itself was fashioned from camel hides sewn with silver thread."
