        "mainbody": "The Tent of the Bows and Quivers, or nom-satakon erughe in Chuchian, was the palace compound that served as the headquarters of Chuqali Shilai, the qaghan of the Fankiang tribe, in the city of Li-Raz. It was considered the grandest building in all the Plain of Horses.\nThe compound comprised four buildings made of red brick, each standing three stories high. Each had a different function. The first building was Shilais living quarters. The second building housed meeting rooms and spaces for receiving visitors. The third building contained the qaghans throne room and held his silver-plated treasures, with bows and quivers of arrows on one side and saddles and shields on the other. Finally, the fourth building stabled a herd of white camels, which were considered sacred, as well as the large white cart that transported Shilais mobile personal yurt. The yurt itself was fashioned from camel hides sewn with silver thread."
