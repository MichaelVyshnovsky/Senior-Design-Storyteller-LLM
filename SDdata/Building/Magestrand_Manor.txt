The '''Magestrand Manor''' was the residence of [[Oracle (Ravens Bluff)|Oracle]], the Minister of Divination in the [[Ministry of Art]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], located in the [[Pumpside]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Southside District|Southside District]].

==Location==
The manse stood where [[Zeldazar Street]] crossed [[Samarglast Lane]], on the eastern side of the moot where the two streets met [[Stonekeep End]].

==Structure==
The Magestrand Manor was a grandiose mase made of [[whitestone]]. Numerous white statues were found embedded in the building, standing guard at the main entrance, accentuating the rooftop's corners, and scattered around the garden. It was said that Oracle himself ensorcelled the statues to attack intruders. Whether that was true or not, it was advised not to try the manse's defenses as powerful and quiet [[wizard]]s were known to be prepared for such intrusions.

==History==
The Magestrand Manor was home to Oracle of [[Ravens Bluff]] during his time with the Ministry of Art as well as when he served the [[Wizards Guild]] in the 14{{th}} century DR.
