The Magestrand Manor was the residence of Oracle, the Minister of Divination in the Ministry of Art in the late 14 century DR, located in the Pumpside neighborhood of the Southside District.
The manse stood where Zeldazar Street crossed Samarglast Lane, on the eastern side of the moot where the two streets met Stonekeep End.
The Magestrand Manor was a grandiose mase made of whitestone. Numerous white statues were found embedded in the building, standing guard at the main entrance, accentuating the rooftops corners, and scattered around the garden. It was said that Oracle himself ensorcelled the statues to attack intruders. Whether that was true or not, it was advised not to try the manses defenses as powerful and quiet wizards were known to be prepared for such intrusions.
The Magestrand Manor was home to Oracle of Ravens Bluff during his time with the Ministry of Art as well as when he served the Wizards Guild in the 14 century DR.
