'''Orgulin's Mansion''' was a large rooming house found in [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The structure was originally built as a lavish mansion, and its distinctive four massive domes made it stand out as a landmark in Yhaunn.

==Location==
The mansion was located near the center of the city, towards the northern cliffs.

==History==
The Mansion originated as the palatial home of the slaver [[Orgulin]]. When he was slain, his mansion was taken over and used as a boarding house by [[1358 DR]], with a decidedly lawless atmosphere in its sprawling wings.
