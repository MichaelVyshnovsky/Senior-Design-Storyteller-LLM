Orgulins Mansion was a large rooming house found in Yhaunn in the 14 century DR.
The structure was originally built as a lavish mansion, and its distinctive four massive domes made it stand out as a landmark in Yhaunn.
The mansion was located near the center of the city, towards the northern cliffs.
The Mansion originated as the palatial home of the slaver Orgulin. When he was slain, his mansion was taken over and used as a boarding house by 1358 DR, with a decidedly lawless atmosphere in its sprawling wings.
