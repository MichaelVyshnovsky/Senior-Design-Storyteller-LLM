        "mainbody": "amanthas mortuary was a business owned by the necromancer Lamantha that provided mortician and taxidermy services to the undead inhabitants of Evernight in the Shadowfell.\nIt was located north of the river of lava that flowed through Evernight.\nAs a mortician and taxidermist, much of Lamanthas work involved preparing bodies (or parts of bodies) as decorations, sporting equipment, tools, or trophies for her undead clientele. She was also involved in preparing living humanoids to be killed and eaten by the undead of Evernight in ritualistic \"funerals\" held in the Graveyard. This included sedating the victim with a powerful paralytic (derived from the humors of ghouls), then cleaning the victim, dressing them in fine clothes, and delivering them to the Temple of Filth.\nLamantha also provided \"healing\" to injured undead as well as cosmetic services to make them appear to be alive.\nOwing to the fact that Evernights undead did not harass Lamantha in recognition of her services, her mortuary was one of the only places in Evernight where living people might find shelter as of  (assuming Lamantha could tolerate them)."
