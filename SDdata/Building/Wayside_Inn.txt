The Wayside Inn was a hostel for travelers in the Triboar Trail region south of Neverwinter.
The Wayside Inn was located at the western end of the Triboar Trail where the trail met the High Road.
In the late 15 century DR, the Wayside Inn was owned by Martisha Vinetalker. She employed Backes Dunfield as the bartender and Cooragh Struckt as the cook. The inn also contained a small smithy, which was operated by Teega.
Many enterprising innkeepers attempted to run an inn at the intersection of the Triboar Trail and the High Road. Some of them were successful for many years before succumbing to monsters or bandits. Others gave up soon once the dangers became obvious.
Circa 1491 DR, the Wayside Inn was attacked by undead that were created by the cult of Myrkul led by Ularan Mortus. A group of adventurers was able to defend the inn against the undead attack.
Later, the cult of Talos led by Fheralai Stormsworn occupied the inn. Unknown to the owner Martisha Vinetalker, most of her employees were members of the cult. They impaled the guests as sacrifices to the Stormbringer and tried to turn the Wayside Inn into a temple of Talos. In the process, the cultists summoned a violent thunderstorm around the inn. Ultimately, the same group of adventurers was able to stop the ritual in time. However, the Talos cultists managed to abduct Tarbin Tul, a local bard.
