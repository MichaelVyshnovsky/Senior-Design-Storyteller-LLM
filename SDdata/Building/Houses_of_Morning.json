This last one was in High Town, on top of Loudwater Crag and near High Lords Hall.\nThe high priest of the Houses of Morning was Prior Athosar.\nPrior Athosar provided healing and resurrection magic such as raise dead, albeit for an appropriate fee. He could also remove corruption in a consecrated space and cure those afflicted with lycanthropy, at no cost."
