The '''Thieves' Guildhall''' was the headquarters of the [[naug-orls]] in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The guildhall was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] in the southwest on the [[Street of Bones]]

==Description==
The Thieves' Guildhall was a fortified structure and stood four storys tall. The guildhall's basement connected directly to Zhentil Keep's sewer system, which was used extensively for illicit operations.

==Activities==
The naug-orls used this location as a base of operations, a training area, and living area.

==Inhabitants==
Most of the [[thieves]] who lived here had not yet accumulated enough wealth to purchase their own homes elsewhere in Zhentil Keep.
