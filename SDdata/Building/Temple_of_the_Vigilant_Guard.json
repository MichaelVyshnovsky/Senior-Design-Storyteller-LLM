        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[priest]]s from this temple captured a [[lich]] in [[Chondalwood]] by the name of [[Hlura|Hlura the Ebonsoul]]. Finding themselves unable to destroy her, the Helmite priests trapped her within a [[coffin]] made of [[silver]] and sealed it with both several layers of [[magic]] and molten silver. They then took Hlura and the [[evil]] artifacts in her lair back to Iljak. These belongings were rumored to include a ''[[mirror of life trapping]]'', a ''[[staff of the magi]]'', seven different types of magical [[wand]]s, and most treasured of all, three [[scroll]]s of beaten metal.\n\nOnce back home, the Temple of the Vigilant Guard contracted a merchant ship by the name of ''[[Thepurl's Diamond]]'' to transport these goods across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to the [[Temple of the Noble Hand]] in [[Tsurlagol]], wherein lived Helmites powerful enough to permanently destroy them. Seven Helmite [[crusader]]s, adorned in [[Plate mail]], alongside three priests brought the imprisoned lich and her artifacts on to the ship within huge crates that made the ''Diamond's'' captain reluctant to take the job. Determined to see the evil vanquished, the Helmites paid them in a thousand [[scarlet pearl]]s from the [[Lake of Steam]].\n\nOn [[Mirtul 10]], ''Thepurl's Diamond'' set sail from Iljak. It was expected to reach its destination after a month of travel and two stops along the way to the ports of [[Reth]] and [[Delthuntle]]. However, the ship would come to mysteriously sink {{SI|3|miles|long=yes}} west of the island of [[Shamandra]], after having sailed past its western cape. ''Thepurl's Diamond'' and its evil cargo came to rest along the upper slopes of one of the [[Mountains of Volar]]. While the Helmites that were on the ship were never heard from again, having likely drowned due to the weight of their plate mail."
