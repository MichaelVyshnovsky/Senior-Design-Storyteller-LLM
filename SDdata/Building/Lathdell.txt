Lathdell was a small strake, or an open plaza, of roughly triangular shape located in the Heapside district of the Lower City in Baldurs Gate.
The strake was located at the northeastern outer city walls and stretched towards the stoop of the Shrine of the Suffering dedicated to the deity Ilmater. Hulkael Street, once a long street, cut short by the 14 century DR, began on Lathdell and connected it to another strakeâ€”Murls Rest on Stormshore Street.
