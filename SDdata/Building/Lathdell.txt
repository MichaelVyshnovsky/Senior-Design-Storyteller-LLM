'''Lathdell''' was a small strake, or an open plaza, of roughly triangular shape located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]] district of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Location==
The strake was located at the northeastern outer city walls and stretched towards the stoop of the [[Shrine of the Suffering]] dedicated to the deity [[Ilmater]]. [[Hulkael Street]], once a long street, cut short by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], began on Lathdell and connected it to another strake—[[Murl's Rest]] on [[Stormshore Street]].
