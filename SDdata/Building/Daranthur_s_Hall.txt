'''Daranthur's Hall''' was a "shared-roof" market located in downtown [[Athkatla]], in the nation of [[Amn]], during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/407/Eye on the Realms: A Surprising Vintage|44,45}}

==History==
The market was severely damaged during an attempt to uncover a smuggling ring within the city. [[Storl Thammuraster]], [[Amaront]] of [[Selgaunt]], and [[Onth Tarralus]] of [[Silverymoon]] used a [[gem]]-exploding [[spell]] to detonate the gems hidden in bottles, causing a series of explosions that killed dozens of traders and shoppers. After calling additional contacts, three merchant families—the [[Aerlond]]s, [[Kravalondur]]s, and [[Morornd]]s—were exposed as smugglers.
