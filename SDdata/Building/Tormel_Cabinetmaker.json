        "mainbody": "Tormel Cabinetmaker was a furniture shop found in Tegals Mark within Tasseldale during the midâ€“14 century DR. It featured chests, armoires, dressers, and other furnishings of all kinds crafted by the semi-retired furniture-maker Tormel. He was widely regarded as the finest crasftsperson of his specialty in all of the Dalelands.\nAs Tormel wound down his production of goods over the years, and his son Senn took over responsibilities of the shop, furniture marked with his stamp steadily increased in value. The number of his works that cost over 100 gp increased just as much."
