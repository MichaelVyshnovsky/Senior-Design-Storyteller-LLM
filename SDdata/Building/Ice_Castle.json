        "mainbody": "'''Ice Castle''' was a castle located in the [[Alpuk]] region of the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Location": "The castle stood within a fissure at the base of the northern side of [[Mount Okk]].",
        "Structure": "Ice Castle was constructed primarily of ice that was resistant to all forms of heat. The interior of the castle was an intricate maze of corridors. At random, these corridors could be filled with blasts of freezing winds, storms of ice, and blizzards. Somewhere within the castle was a vault made from glowing ice, containing the magical research of the wizards. Beneath the castle was a labyrinth, in which the wizards stored a horde of [[gem]]s and precious metals.",
        "History": "Ice Castle was built in {{Yearlink|1141}}. In {{Yearlink|1148}}, a powerful earthquake caused the castle to sink into a large fissure, which was covered in snow and ice by a massive avalanche.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|1340}}, hunters from [[Lilinuk]] discovered the journal of an explorer whose body had been magically turned to ice. The journal described the interior of the castle, the experiments of the resident wizards and the castle's denizens.",
        "Inhabitants": "The castle was built by a group of evil [[Vaasa]]n [[wizard]]s, who sought an isolated location to create new cold-based spells and creatures with the purpose of conquering Vaasa. They eventually developed an entirely new type of cold-based magic. After the cataclysm that buried the castle, the wizards encased their dying bodies in large icicles hanging from a huge central chamber. Their spirits later roamed the corridors of the castle. The wizards' magical creations, including headless ice [[zombie]]s, still wandered the castle."
