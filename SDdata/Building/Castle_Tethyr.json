        "mainbody": "'''Castle Tethyr''' was once the palace of the royalty of [[Tethyr]] before its fall at the start of the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}. In its day, it was the largest castle in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. After it was burned to the ground, its haunted ruins were known as the '''Tethyruins'''.\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Location": "The castle was located in the [[Purple Marches]], in what would later be [[County Bardshyr]]. It sat less than {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} from the intersection of the [[Trade Way]] and the [[Ithal Road]].\n\nThe region around the castle was fertile for keeping herds of livestock.",
        "Structure": "The entire square castle covered an area of about {{SI|4.6|acre|long=yes}} with about {{SI|450|ft|long=yes}} per side. It had three stories and had a subterranean [[dungeon]].\n\nWithout the building sat many supporting structures for housing servants, soldiers, and animals; for storing food and supplies; and acting as workshops for craftsmen.",
        "Defenses": "The castle's walls were {{SI|45|ft|long=yes}} high. It was encompassed by a deep moat.",
        "Inhabitants": "The castle was once home to the entire royal family of Tethyr.\n\nAfter its fall, hordes of [[undead]] infested the ruins, including [[ghast]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[haunt]]s, and [[shadow]]s&mdash;all the [[spirit]]s of those who died in the betrayal that happened when the castle was burned to the ground.",
        "History": "[[File:Siege of Castle Tethyr.png|thumb|right|250px|''Soldiers battling atop the burning castle.'']]\nOn the night of [[Eleint 11]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, a party was held to which the count of [[Lathmarch]], the count of the [[Mir Protectorate]], and the duke of [[Dusk]] had been invited.\n\nDuring the night, the castle was besieged by King [[Alemander IV]]'s largest army, led by General [[Nashram Sharboneth]]. The army also had recruited angry peasants from the surrounding countryside. These peasants soon set the castle ablaze, near midnight.\n\nThe entire castle burned to the ground over the next seven hours. By dawn of the [[Eleint 12|12{{th}}]], the entire royal family, including the king and his wife, Queen [[Rhinda]]; the king's son, Prince [[Alemander V]]; Alemander V's wife [[Dhara]]; and the two royal grandchildren Princes [[Jhodak]] and [[Leodom]]. The noble counts and duke who had attended the party that night had also died, being prevented from being rescued by the servants by the soldiers who besieged the castle. The king's garrison commander and many of his loyal army officers also perished, because they had been strangely recalled to the inner areas of the castle rather than posted on the outer walls. General Sharboneth is supposed to have also died in the fire, though his body was never found.\n\nOne of the few survivors of the blaze was [[Marilyn Haresdown]], an officer in the army. Sadly, her husband and fellow soldier [[Dorian Haresdown]] died in the carnage. (Marilyn would later become a member of the [[Company of Eight]] and after a duchess of Tethyr.)",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Several of the surviving servants of the tragedy claimed that the incident was the result of the scheming of Prince Alemander V, who plotted with General Sharboneth to take over the throne by force. However, General Sharboneth betrayed the prince in the end.\n\nOn the night of the castle's fall, a [[priest]]ess of [[Beshaba]], [[Dlatha Faenar]], was seen visiting General Sharboneth's camp, and she was later spotted on the castle's walls as well, leading some to suspect that the [[Church of Beshaba]] also played a role in the castle's demise.\n\nAn elder [[beholder]] [[Xithallowthlan]] claimed to have orchestrated the events of the castle's destruction and later to have secretly aided [[Zaranda Star]] in her rise to the throne at the end of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregum]]&mdash;all as part of the game of [[Vellurith]]. The [[Great Mother]] supposedly gifted Xithallowthlan with body plates covered with functional eyes as a reward for his completion of one of the goals of the game.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Vellurith, Part One}}\n\nThe ghosts of Prince Alemander V and General Sharboneth were said to be in perpetual conflict with each other within the Tethyruins."
