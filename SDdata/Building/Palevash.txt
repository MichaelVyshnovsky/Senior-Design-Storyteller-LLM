Palevash was an ancient and isolated monastery founded centuries before the 14th century DR by the monks of Shou Lung.
Many monks of the monastery came to it from the native tribes across the Northern Wastes. However, these tribes and local races sometimes launched raids against the monastery for its wealth. Only the Pazruki respected its dominion over its valley and held it in high esteem.
At some point in the 14 century DR, a female fighter, Rhenovia Swiftthorn, attempted to unite women of the monastery into a political force to be reckoned with. However, her plans were squashed and she was banished from Palevash.
