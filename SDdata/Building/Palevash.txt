'''Palevash''' was an ancient and isolated monastery founded centuries before the 14th century [[DR]] by the monks of [[Shou Lung]].

==History==
Many monks of the monastery came to it from the native tribes across the [[Northern Wastes]]. However, these tribes and local races sometimes launched raids against the monastery for its wealth. Only the [[Pazruki]] respected its dominion over its valley and held it in high esteem.<ref>

At some point in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a female [[fighter]], [[Rhenovia Swiftthorn]], attempted to unite women of the monastery into a political force to be reckoned with. However, her plans were squashed and she was banished from Palevash.<ref>
