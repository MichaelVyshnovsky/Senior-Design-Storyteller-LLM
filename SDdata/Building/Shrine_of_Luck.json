        "mainbody": "he Shrine of Luck was a shrine in Phandalin dedicated to the worship of Tymora.\nThe small shrine was located in the center of Phandalin, specifically to the north of the central hub. It was made of a set of stones from the neighboring ruins.\nThe place of worship was under the care of Sister Garaele in 1491 DR. and in her absence it was ransacked by Velleen Firecrow, a member of the Cult of Talos.\nWhile the town of Leilon to the south was being rebuilt, it relied on the Shrine of Luck for certain supplies, such as holy water.\nThe Shrine remained the only temple in Phandalin until the Temple of the Coinmaiden, a place of worship dedicated to Waukeen, opened in 1496 DR."
