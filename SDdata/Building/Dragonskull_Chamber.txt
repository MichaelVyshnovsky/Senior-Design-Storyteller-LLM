The Dragonskull Chamber was a room for spell research in Castle Obarskyr, Suzail.

Marlin Stormserpent tried to use the room as a landmark while traversing the Haunted Wing of Castle Obarskyr, looking for where the Wyverntongue Chalice was hidden, in the Chamber of the Wyrms Ascending.

At the same time, Marlin Stormserpent decided to use that room himself, for his own castings. There, he experimented on calling forth blueflame ghosts from their items, and after being satisfied with their functions, sent forth the ghosts Treth Halonter and Relve Langral to kill a rival nobleman, Seszgar Huntcrown. 
Among the courtiers of Cormyr, it was said the Wyverntongue Chalice was hidden in or near the Dragonskull Chamber.
