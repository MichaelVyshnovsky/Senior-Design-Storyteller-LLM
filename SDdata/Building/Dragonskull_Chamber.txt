The '''Dragonskull Chamber''' was a room for spell research in [[Castle Obarskyr]], [[Suzail]].

==Location==
It was accessible through a side passage of the [[Haunted Wing]].

==Structure==
The double doors were decorated with life-sized dragonskulls made of [[bronze]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|93|9}}

==Interior==
Per [[Alusair Obarskyr]]'s [[ghost]], there was an upper treasury in there.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|83|8}}

==Activities==
Prior to the [[Spellplague]], it had been used for magical practice.

==Defenses==
The wards of the room were especially strong, complex, and indomitable, having grown much more so since the Spellplague; [[War Wizards]] were known to suffer ill effects from as much as getting near them. Inside the room, the pressure was perceptible even to those who were not sorcerous.

==History==
It was said [[Caladnei]] had perished there eighty years prior to the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, in approximately {{yearlink|1399}}.

[[Marlin Stormserpent]] tried to use the room as a landmark while traversing the [[Haunted Wing]] of [[Castle Obarskyr]], looking for where the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' was hidden, in the [[Chamber of the Wyrms Ascending]].{{cite book/Elminster must Die/MMP|107|10}}

Later, [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]] discovered there had been some kind of intrusion and laid down orders to block all entrance to the wing. At the same time, Marlin Stormserpent decided to use that room himself, for his own castings.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|184-185|18}} There, he experimented on calling forth [[blueflame ghost]]s from their items, and after being satisfied with their functions, sent forth the ghosts [[Treth Halonter]] and [[Relve Langral]] to kill a rival nobleman, [[Seszgar Huntcrown]].{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|207-212|20}} 

==Rumors==
Among the courtiers of [[Cormyr]], it was said the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' was hidden in or near the Dragonskull Chamber.{{cite book/Elminster must Die/MMP|96-98|9}}
