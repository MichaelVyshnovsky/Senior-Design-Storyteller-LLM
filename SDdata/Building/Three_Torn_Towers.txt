Ascalhorn, Eaerlann
The Three Torn Towers was a trio of gate towers of the fortress-city Ascalhorn, later known as Hellgate Keep. They were one of three sites that remained of the fortress following its destruction in 1369 DR.
These towers stood along the ramp leading up to Hellgate Keep, being the most easy way to access the ruined fortress.
Suffering heavy damage during Hellgate Keeps destruction, the top three floors of these stone towers collapsed and most of their walls blew out, as did the gates that linked them together. By 1370 DR, all three of the towers were partially covered in vines.
The southernmost of the Three Torn Towers had hidden behind rubble a crawlspace leading to a hidden spiral stairwell,
The treant forces of Turlang stood outside around the Three Torn Towers following Hellgate Keeps destruction, guarding against those who would seek to plunder the evil that laid inside the ruins.
