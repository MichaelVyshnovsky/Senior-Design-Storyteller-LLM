            "Atmosphere": "In the evenings in good weather, The Wizard's Hand taproom would fill with Maskyrvians, who met to drink and to hear news, [[clack]], and music from the travelers, [[adventurer]]s, and itinerant minstrels that passed through. If bidden, the Maskyrvians told their own stories of the area, sometimes growing quite exaggerated. [[Bard]]s were especially welcome, with audiences gladly giving coin for a ballad or dramatic story, despite how often it might've been heard before.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|26}}"

        "Services": "As well as drinks of [[beer]], [[brambleberry wine]], [[sund]], and Mulmaster [[brandy]], a typical meal could include roast [[stag]] with [[wildsage stew|wildsage vegetable stew]]. For dessert, there was sweet [[tart]]s with [[brambleberry (berry)|brambleberry]] jelly and bowls of [[sugarbread]] soaked in brandy and coated in cream.\n\nWhen [[dwarves]] journeyed out of the mountains and stayed in Maskyr's Eye to trade for around four days, two or three times a year, merchants from [[Mulmaster]] would rush to the village to trade with them. At these times, The Wizard's Hand would fill with guests, and the leftovers paid to stay at a local farm or camped by the road.\n\nThe village council also met in The Wizard's Hand, unless it was fill, in which case they went to the [[House of Plenty (Maskyr's Eye)|House of Plenty]], a temple to [[Chauntea]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 1350s [[DR]], the proprietor and innkeeper was [[Lhullbannen Orlsyr]], son of Riothar. Although aided by his wife and four daughters, he was unwilling to leave the day-to-day business of the inn to them, expecting they wouldn't run it to his high standards."
