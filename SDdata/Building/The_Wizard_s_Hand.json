        "mainbody": "The Wizards Hand was an inn in the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the late 13 and 14 centuries DR. Although the only inn in the village, it was famous to travelers in the Vast, who thought to be among the three best inns to be found along the regions roads, It was named for the archmage Maskyr One-Eye.\nThe inn was established some time around 1277 DR by Riothar Orlsyr. This followed the burning down of a prior inn, The Three Dead Orcs.\nIt was situated beside the House of Plenty, a temple to Chauntea.\nConstructed of stone and timber under a thatched roof, The Wizards Hand was a low and sprawling structure.\nThe inn held ten private rooms and one grand common room wherein around forty-five people could sleep in comfort.\nIn the evenings in good weather, The Wizards Hand taproom would fill with Maskyrvians, who met to drink and to hear news, clack, and music from the travelers, adventurers, and itinerant minstrels that passed through. If bidden, the Maskyrvians told their own stories of the area, sometimes growing quite exaggerated. Bards were especially welcome, with audiences gladly giving coin for a ballad or dramatic story, despite how often it mightve been heard before.\nAs well as drinks of beer, brambleberry wine, sund, and Mulmaster brandy, a typical meal could include roast stag with wildsage vegetable stew. For dessert, there was sweet tarts with brambleberry jelly and bowls of sugarbread soaked in brandy and coated in cream.\nWhen dwarves journeyed out of the mountains and stayed in Maskyrs Eye to trade for around four days, two or three times a year, merchants from Mulmaster would rush to the village to trade with them. At these times, The Wizards Hand would fill with guests, and the leftovers paid to stay at a local farm or camped by the road.\nThe village council also met in The Wizards Hand, unless it was fill, in which case they went to the House of Plenty, a temple to Chauntea.\nIn the late 1350s DR, the proprietor and innkeeper was Lhullbannen Orlsyr, son of Riothar. Although aided by his wife and four daughters, he was unwilling to leave the day-to-day business of the inn to them, expecting they wouldnt run it to his high standards."
