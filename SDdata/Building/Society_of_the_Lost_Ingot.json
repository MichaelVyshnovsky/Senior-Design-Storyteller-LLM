        "Location": "The Society of the Lost Ingot stood on Sarlannus Street, facing the home of collector [[Thammas Thoul]] across the street. The [[Crown Aflame]] theater stood on the same side of Sarlannus Street as the Society, just separated by a single building.",
        "Activities": "Only males born in Athkatla were allowed membership in the Society of the Lost Ingot. All of the club's young members were wealthy merchants who owned trading ships and fleets. The name of the \"Lost Ingot\" was inspired by one thing the cult's members had in common â€“ they lost at least one merchant ship at sea. The Society of the Lost Ingot's meetings were dedicated to discussing social gatherings and investment discussions.",
        "History": "Before the city of Athkatla sacked temples and shrines of the Temple District in the {{YearlinkName|1267}}, the building where the Society of the Lost Ingot was located was a temple to [[Ilmater]]."
