        "History": "Ashhold was considered a holy land by ash giants, and thus a neutral ground between their tribes.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]] took control of the citadel and used its influence to control the ash giants tribes, After the [[wizard]] [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]] uncovered Skuthosiin as the true mastermind of the giants, [[Vanquisher]] [[Tarhun]] ordered a joint military operation with all the tymatheran military forces and led a siege to Ashhold. In the ensuing battle, the dragonborn killed Skuthosiin, ending the giant threat to Tymanther.",
