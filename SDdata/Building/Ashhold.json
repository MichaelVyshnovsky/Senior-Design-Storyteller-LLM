        "mainbody": "Ashhold was an ash giant citadel in the Black Ash Plain. The citadels fortifications were entirely natural and consisted of huge basalt pillars with lava pits and flows.\nAshhold was considered a holy land by ash giants, and thus a neutral ground between their tribes.\nIn 1479 DR, the green dragon Skuthosiin took control of the citadel and used its influence to control the ash giants tribes, After the wizard Biri uncovered Skuthosiin as the true mastermind of the giants, Vanquisher Tarhun ordered a joint military operation with all the tymatheran military forces and led a siege to Ashhold. In the ensuing battle, the dragonborn killed Skuthosiin, ending the giant threat to Tymanther.\nCategoryCastles\nCategoryCitadels\nCategoryLocations in the Old Empires\nCategoryLocations in Unther\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in East Faerûn\nknkfgrlz4al893i0sgbqbj3nofyeyj2"
