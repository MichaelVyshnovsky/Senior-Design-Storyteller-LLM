        "mainbody": "The Crossed Quills House was the guildhall for the Guild of Clerks and Scribes that operated within the city of Ravens Bluff in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was located on the corner of DeVillars Ride and Raven Way within the Altarside of the citys Temple District.\nThe doors of the Crossed Quills had archways that were adorned with sculptures of ravens holding onto open books. It was flanked by a number of long, narrow windows with relief carvings of crossed quills above them. The open book carvings were a source of curiosity and intrigue among the residents of Altarside. \nIt was local tradition for Ravenian children to climb up the archways to read what was written within the books, and the more agile rogues and adventurers in the city would scribe chalk messages to one another within their pages."
