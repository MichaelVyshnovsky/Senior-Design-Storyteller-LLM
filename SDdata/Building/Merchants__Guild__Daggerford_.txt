The '''Merchants' Guild''' was the guildhall for the various merchants and businesspeople in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Location==
The guildhall was located where the southern arm of [[Rogar Alley]] met the [[High Road (Daggerford)|High Road]] in central Daggerford near the drill field. It was one of the larger buildings found along the High Road.

==Description==
The first floor of this building was cut out as if it were a basement, while the second floor was used as the primary meeting hall. The guildhall was haphazardly decorated with statues, pottery, and carvingsâ€“none of which blended well with any of the other decor.

==Activities==
Meetings held here between the various merchants of Daggerford with the hopes of gaining a communal influence over the city council was mostly a waste of time given the merchants' inherent competitive nature against each other.
