'''Angrym's Livery''' was a stable and [[horse]] trader in [[Thentia]]. It was owned and operated by the [[ranger]] [[Angrym]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Location==
Angrym's was in the south-eastern corner of Thentia, fairly close to the docks.

==Services==
Angrym's was fully equipped to buy and sell, as well as generally care for and house horses and rarer creatures such as [[griffon]]s, [[pegasus|pegasi]], and [[hippogriff]]s. It also had the facilities to shoe animals, having its own farrier and blacksmith.

The office had a backroom that was used exclusively by passing rangers and [[Harpers]] who needed a place to conduct private business.
