        "mainbody": "he Bookworm Inn was an inn in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIt stood near the VeltiEnorethal, a school of elven culture and magic.\nIt was a small, sedate, and peaceful place and, as evidenced by its name and locale, its patrons were mostly students and scholars from out of town. Conversation of course often turned toward history, religion, philosophy, and other academic matters.\nIt had a home brew of high quality."
