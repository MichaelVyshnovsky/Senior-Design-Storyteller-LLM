The temple of Kelemvor in the Silverwisp Swamp was a holy fortification dedicated to Kelemvor the Lord of the Dead, that came into use throughout the late 15 century DR.
The temple was situated nearby the ruined village of Grimhollow within the Silverwisp Swamp, along the Sword Coast region of the North.
The wood-and-stone temple was heavily damaged, but enough of the structure remained to offer protection from the undead and vicious creatures beyond.
Statues of robed, skeletal figures adorned its main entrance, flanked by banners depicting Kelemvors holy symbol. A large brazier and several sconces illuminated by blue fire provided light amid the encroaching fog that permeated the swamp.
Defense of the temple was minimal, lone sentries stood at the temples perimeter monitoring for any emergent threats.

The expedition was an abject failure. Soulhearth remained the sole survivor of the assault forces and retreated back to the temple within the swamp. Joined by a handful of others, Soulhearth did all he could to hold the undead at bay and prevent them from overwhelming the surrounding lands.
