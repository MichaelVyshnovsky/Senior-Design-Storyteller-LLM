The '''Downunda Patisserie''', also written as the '''Downunder Patisserie''',{{Cite polyhedron/51/The Living City: The Downunda Patisserie|16-17}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Wings|2-4,22}} created grand cakes for the city's rich and powerful, and on two separate occasions was visited by planar beings.

==Location==
It stood in the [[Burnt Gables]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] district of Ravens Bluff, on the corner of [[Khalamongre Street]] and [[Jossil Street]].{{Cite organized play/LC/All Bad Things Must Come to an End|11}} It was a middle-class business area, and nearer the upper-class area than the poor area.

==Structure==
The stone building was L-shaped, with the end of the long arm of the L facing the street with the shopfront. It had two stories, with the ground floor given over to the business and upper floor used as a family home. Sweet smells emanated from it throughout the day.

==Interior==
The ground floor had three main sections. The front of the building was the store and was open to the public. Here, an L-shaped counter ringed the room with large glass cabinets displaying the day's wares;

Behind the kitchen, in the other arm of the L, was the family's private dining room and stairs up. Upstairs was a living room,

==Atmosphere==
All were welcome in the Downunda Patisserie, but some more than others received especially polite and personal attention. That is, Jemima worried [[halfling]]s would be too tempted by her baked goods and shoplift them when she wasn't looking, so she and her children made sure to attend to them personally and politely the whole time they were present. Jemima also didn't like [[adventurer]]s, so any customer who stood out as one was served politely and swiftly, so they could be out of the store sooner. Later, it was only "the adventuring type" that she worried about.

Regardless, the Downunda Patisserie was one of the most popular places to visit for Ravenians from outside the Burnt Gables neighborhood. [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] officers making their rounds there always made sure to visit.

==Services==
The Downunda Patisserie sold fresh [[bread]]s, sweet breads, pastries, pies, tarts, cookies, hand cakes, and large high-quality cakes for special occasions. The other baked goods were only a little less popular. By closing time, the shelves were bare, leading some to affectionately call Jemima "Mother Hubbard" after a [[Wikipedia:Old Mother Hubbard|nursery rhyme]] from [[Earth|another world]]. There was typically a stock of one to four dozen of each item available.

Many of the wealthier citizens of Ravens Bluff preferred to have Jemima Chisolm prepare grand cakes for their special occasions instead of relying on their own kitchen staff. They paid handsomely for her cakes, enough to put her youngest child through school and supply her with magical enhancements to her business.

It was rumored that Jemima regularly baked extra batches of cakes and delivered them to poorer parts of Ravens Bluff; true or not, she was well known there, despite the fact that her wares were too expensive for poor folk.

The store opened just before dawn and closed at dusk.

==Defenses==
The storage room was protected by a ''[[glyph of warding]]'' that affected trespassers with a ''[[charm person]]'' [[spell]] that made them leave the store and immediately turn themselves in to Ravens Bluff's Chief Constable of the City Watch, who was [[Rolf Sunriver]] around [[1370 DR]].<ref> Only Jemima and Derek knew the key to bypassing the ''glyph''. This security measure was installed by a friendly [[cleric]] as payment for a birthday cake for her bishop.

==Staff==
The Downunda Patisserie was owned and run by [[Jemima Chisolm]], who was becoming renowned for her culinary talents. She lived above the store with her three children, [[Derek Chisolm|Derek]], [[Allison Chisolm|Allison]], and [[Karl Chisolm|Karl]]. Derek and Allison, the older children, were kept busy helping their mother in the business by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy,

By 1370 DR, Jemima had recently hired members of the neighboring Lontle family to run errands buying and fetching ingredients such as flour, [[fruit]]s, nuts, and sundry seasonings. Around that time, a girl named [[Sulene]] also worked the counter.

==History==
Jemima Chisolm and her three children arrived in Ravens Bluff. She had but one item of value in her possession, a [[gem]], which she would use to purchase the shop. She would say nothing about where she'd come from, why she'd left, and especially where her husband was. If it wasn't baking, it wasn't anyone's business.

The bakery was opened around [[1364 DR]].

Jemima was once commissioned by a great [[wizard]] to bake an anniversary cake the likes of which had never before been seen in Ravens Bluff, and would never be seen there again. She did so with expert skill and the wizard gave her the magical oven, on the provision that she never make that cake again.

During [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s war in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, raids on barges on the [[River Vesper]] interrupted goods getting into Ravens Bluff. Among other businesses, Dowunder Patisserie lost one crate of [[sugar]], {{SI|3|lb|long=yes}} red sugar, {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}} each of blue and green sugar, 3 crates of [[flour]], {{SI|3|lb|long=yes}} [[nutmeg]], {{SI|2|lb|long=yes}} [[tumeric]], {{SI|4|lb|long=yes}} [[cinnamon]], {{SI|2|qt|long=yes}} [[vanilla]], {{SI|1|qt|long=yes}} [[lime]] extract, {{SI|4|qt|long=yes}} [[cherry]] juice, {{SI|5|qt|long=yes}} [[grape]] juice, {{SI|3|lb|long=yes}} [[yeast]], {{SI|2|lb|long=yes}} [[baking soda]], {{SI|4|lb|long=yes}} [[baking powder]], {{SI|5|lb|long=yes}} [[sprinkles]], and a jar each of [[anise]], [[butterscotch]], [[licorice]], and [[peppermint]], as well as twelve [[apron]]s. If anyone returned these, Jemima Chisolm would reward them with six-dozen double-chocolate-chip cookies.{{Cite organized play/LC/Love and Death on the Vesper River|5,17}}

In [[Kythorn]] of 1370 DR, the store had its Sixth Anniversary Celebration, with many new treats and drinks on sale. One day, whilst heading out of town to deal with [[kobold]] bandits, a group of adventurers stopped at the Downunder Patisserie for something to snack on on the way and were served by Sulene. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of [[Aethalynmur]], a winged [[solar]] in a [[loincloth]], who sought heroes to liberate [[Nimbus City]] in the [[demi-plane]] of [[Arrus]]. He did not require a cake.{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Wings|6}} Later that year, [[Mijel Morigan]] visited to collect an order of two baskets of sweet bread loaves for his wife [[Jandra]]'s restaurant; he may have had adventurers in tow. If they mentioned their help in arranging the wedding of famed Vast adventurers [[Despherion Wolf]] and Lady [[Fawn Sweetrose Moonray Thorin]], then Jemima would be very interested and, if requested, eagerly baked a black forest chocolate cake as a gift for the couple.{{Cite organized play/LC/Invitation to a Wedding|9,10}}

Two years later, in [[Kythorn]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Dowunder Patisserie was again having a special event, this time to thank the heroic adventurers of the Living City with a free cup of pink lemonade and piece of sponge cake. The promotion was popular, bringing many adventurers to its door. It also brought the sylph Rahmare, riding a cloud down the street to the amazement of many, as she sought heroes to locate her lost friend Aethalynmur.{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Plight|2-3}} And maybe some chocolate.{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Plight|15}} and might've found pastries helpful in bribing the [[frost giant]]s holding Aethalynmur captive.{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Plight|16}} Later, Aethalynmur would transport his saviors back to the street outside the Dowunder Patisserie, again stunning passersby.{{Cite organized play/LC/Aethalynmur's Plight|18}}

Later, adventurers were discreetly recruited via [[Spath Investigations]] to work for Lady [[Katharine Blacktree]]; one was given a note requesting them to "come alone to the entrance of the Downunder Patisserie at sunset." before being met an agent and directed elsewhere.{{Cite organized play/LC/Cloaks and Daggers|3,17}}
