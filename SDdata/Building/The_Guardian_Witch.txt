This warm and cozy inn was located in the northwest section of the city along the shore of Lake Ashane.
Given its close proximity to the lake, the Guardian Witch catered mostly to fisherman who travelled to Immilar to sell their catches, or sailors waiting while their ships were repaired.
The Guardian Witch was owned by an old woman named Green Huldra who opened the inn after losing an eye in a fishing accident. She was assisted by ten of her grandchildren.
