The '''Guardian Witch''' was an [[inn]] found in the capital city of [[Immilmar]] in [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Location==
This warm and cozy inn was located in the northwest section of the city along the shore of [[Lake Ashane]].

==Activities==
Given its close proximity to the lake, the Guardian Witch catered mostly to fisherman who travelled to Immilar to sell their catches, or sailors waiting while their ships were repaired.

==Inhabitants==
The Guardian Witch was owned by an old woman named [[Green Huldra]] who opened the inn after losing an eye in a fishing accident. She was assisted by ten of her grandchildren.
