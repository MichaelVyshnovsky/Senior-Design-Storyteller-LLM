Lilanths Librams was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
Lilanths Librams was a two-story building in fair condition.
Lilanths Librams served as Skullports closest approximation to a library and bookstore. The shop contained an impressive collection of hundreds of books. Topics ranged from practical guides, such as Cormyrean gardening manuals, to esoteric subjects like hedge magic. Prices varied widely, with more common volumes starting at 20 gold pieces and rare tomes commanding prices of 2,000 gold pieces or more.
In addition to book sales, Lilanths Librams offered scrivening supplies, including parchment, ink, and quills, as well as bookbinding services. Imaginative leather book covers and ornate metal clasps had garnered particular praise among clientele.
Lilanths Librams was owned by the reserved and soft-spoken wizard Lilanth Shytongue. The shop was notably home to a small legion of cats, which served as vigilant guardians against mice, rats and jermlaine.
