        "mainbody": "'''Cholandrothipe's Tower''' was the prominent landmark found in the village of [[Feather Falls (village)|Feather Falls]] in [[Featherdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.",
        "Description": "The tower was a fire-blackened ruin that resembled a large slender cylinder as of [[1367 DR]]. A single porch-like entrance allowed access to the tower. The tower appeared small from the outside but was rumored to plunge deep into the earth and cross beneath the [[River Ashaba]] to emerge on the other side of the river. Some of the tower's lowest chambers were rumored to lead to the [[Deep Realm]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "The tower was once the home of the [[wizard]] [[Cholandrothipe]].",
        "History": "The tower was ruined by its own defenses when a group of [[mage]]s from [[Thay]] attempted to break into the tower to steal Cholandrothipe's [[gold]] and [[magic item]]s.",
        "Defenses": "Several [[golem]]s, [[xorn]], and a [[ghost]] served as guardians for the tower. A [[living wall]] formed part of the tower's structure as well. Cholandrothipe also enchanted several traps that triggered wands of ''[[wand of withering|withering]]'' and ''[[Wand of polymorph|polymorphing]]''. Some of Cholandrothipe's treasure chests concealed deadly [[ooze]]s that were released as soon as the chests were opened. ''[[Gate]]'' traps transported unwanted visitors to sealed rooms that contained other deadly monsters. These rooms were only escapable by using different gates that transported the individual to the ceiling of a different room and dropped them for a long fall.\n\n[[Adventurer]]s who explored the tower reported that they discovered several invisible doors along the tower's stairwells. Other doors opened from the outer walls into other dimensional regions where treasure was kept safe behind deadly [[spell]] webs."
