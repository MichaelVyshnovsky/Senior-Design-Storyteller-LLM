        "mainbody": "The Towers of Good Fortune was a large and extremely wealthy temple in Suzail dedicated to the goddess of luck Tymora. The temple was considered the most prominent in Suzail and was home to over a dozen priests who were assisted by several hundred laymen.\nThe main chamber of the temple had a silver altar with stairs leading to them. There was a poor box in the entrance hall for collecting donations and payments for the services provided.\nThe temple held private studies for audiences. Most of them were musty and had an oil lamp, dark oak cabinets lining the walls, and one window high on a wall. The cabinets were filled with numerous scrolls, magical and mundane, including scrolls of remove curse penned by the arch-cleric Mzentul himself.\nThe temple contained an elaborate wishing well in its courtyard constructed shortly prior to 1479 DR. The well was functionally a fountain with its water cascading down the stairs leading to the statue of Tymora. It was said that the worshipers who threw a gold piece into the fountain while praying were rewarded with the goddess blessing.\nIn the , Alias of Westage passed the Towers of Good Fortune hoping to get help with the mysterious azure magical tattoo she woke up with one day. She decided against it as it looked too expensive, but had to use its services after being turned away from other temples and shrines in the city. She was greeted by curate Winefiddle who agreed to remove curse from her sword arm. The spell caused Alias to lose control of her body and attempt to murder the curate. By Tymoras luck, Winefiddle managed to tumble to safety knocking the warrior out. After Alias came to her senses she was advised to search for a sages help. Shortly after she left, her soon-to-be friend Akabar Bel Akash visited the temple as well.\nIn the , during the Time of Troubles, Tymoras avatar appeared in Arabel, boosting her faith in Cormyr which brought increased attention and prosperity to the Towers of Good Fortune.\nLuckmaster Olane Davanac oversaw the Towers of Good Fortune circa 1479 DR. Arch-cleric Mzentul was in charge of the temple at some point circa 1357 DR. The Towers housed a dozen Luckbringers (priests of Tymora), and a hundred lay worshipers."
