* Meet the Goodberrys, an afternoon comedy about a large family of halfling criminals.

The theater was originally owned by Algondar Daliano and passed on to his wife Iokaste after his death sometime in the late 15 century DR. Lacking her late husbands passion for theater, Iokaste saw the business as a way to interact with and gain the favor of important citizens of Waterdeep. She delegated all artistic and management decisions to the theaters directors.
The violet faerie dragon Wishes was originally Algondars companion and continued working in the theater following his death. The dragon used its magic to provide special effects for the plays and donated all its earnings to Waterdhavians in need, by flying throughout the city while invisible and leaving coins at different locations.
As of the late 15 century DR, notable performers at the Pink Flumph included the drag queen Chaotic Eva, the bard Florizan Blank, and the actress Yaliek Iltizmar.
The Pink Flumph was one of the locations that was potentially said to conceal the entrance to the Vault of Dragons.
