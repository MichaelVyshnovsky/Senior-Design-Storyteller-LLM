        "mainbody": "The '''Cathedral of Night''' was a [[Shadovar]] shrine dedicated to [[Shar]] in the ruins of [[Xinlenal]].",
        "Structure": "The shrine was located inside of a ruined building that appeared to be in no better shape than the rest of the ruined city, although the structure's main entrance had been rebuilt to be much wider.",
        "Interior": "Despite the sorry exterior, the interior was meticulously refurbished. The shrine was lined in black colors, notably with [[onyx]] and [[jet]], and was magically cloaked in shadows. Some of these shadows&mdash;which appeared to flicker even without light&mdash;were almost alive, and hungrily lashed out to feed on the warmth of living creatures.",
        "Activities": "The Cathedral of Night contained a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Shadowfell]] that the Shadovar of Xinlenal used to bring supplies into the city to aid with their reconstruction efforts. The shrine's [[priest]] was thus responsible not only for spiritual matters, but logistics as well.",
        "History": "The Shrine was the very first thing rebuilt by the Shadovar when they rediscovered the fallen [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of Xinlenal in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was completed and operational as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.",
        "Inhabitants": "The shrine's priest was [[Orthinos Eln]]. In addition, the Cathedral of Night hosted [[shade]] and [[shadar-kai (Netherese)|shadar-kai]] guards tasked with keeping nonstop watch over the ''portal''."
