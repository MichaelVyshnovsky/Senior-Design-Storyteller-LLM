        "mainbody": "'''Delmer's Ferry''' was a [[Fire River]] crossing business located in [[the Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Delmer's Ferry office was located on the Fire River's southern bank, on the harbor-end of [[Deepaxe Way]], north of the street crossing with [[Karen Court]], and north of [[Ambra's Small Boats Rental & Harbor Rescue/Retrieval]].",
        "Services": "Delmer's offered manned rowboats to cross the Fire River from the Shutters to [[Shadystreets]], [[Lady Rock]], along the banks, and only when the destination docks were agreed upon. The price for the service varied depending on the number of creatures and amount of cargo being transported, with the trips up and downstream being the most expensive.",
        "Inhabitants": "The business was run by [[Wamaer Delmer]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR. He employed a group of muscled warriors who could easily and quickly row away from any pursuers and could shield the client in times of danger. Wamaer's men were also popular among the ladies of means who sponsored the muscle men attending their evening revels. They regularly oiled their rippling muscles before every shift to attract the ladies' attention. When such invitations preoccupied the boys, Delmer's Ferry was closed with all the boats locked away inside. Despite Delmer's boys' evening proclivities, it was frowned upon taking boats and skiffs during the day on joy rides or to see lady-suitors on the side."
