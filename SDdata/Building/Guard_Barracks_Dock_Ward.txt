These Guard Barracks housed the City Watch of Waterdeep in the citys Dock Ward.
These barracks were located along the Dock Street, close to the Smokehouse and the East Torch Tower.The map provided of the Dock Ward in City of Splendors Waterdeep notably mislabels the barracks as being on the nearby beach and gives the location where they are supposed to be the designation "S57," which is not used for any building in its index.
This building was three-stories tall. Like all barracks of the City Watch, it was built to be fireproof.
