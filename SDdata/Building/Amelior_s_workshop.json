        "mainbody": "This workshop was the residence of Amelior Amanitas when he lived in the village of Volkumburgh in 1358 DR.\nThis workshop was situated west of the villages inn, the Crimson Wyrm.\nthumb|272px|right|Ameliors personal sigil.\nThis workshop was a huge structure, towering over every other building in Volkumburgh. It had a heavy oakwood door, with an elegantly painted nameplate that read, \"A. Amanitas &mdash Alchemist.\" There was also a hidden door off to the side.\nThe frame of that main door was marked with many alchemical and magical symbols, as well as many copies of Ameliors personal sigil. Any attempts made to force the door open by physical or magical means would cause the perpetrator to be shrunken down to  in height.\nThe entry room of the workshop was small, dusty, and dimly lit. It had bags, books, bottles, scrolls, and all manner of containers scattered about.\nThis main room was cavernous in height, built to support the  tall Awtawmatawn that Amelior sought to reconstruct. Around the edges of the room were glowing globes on pedestals. A complex system of scaffolds surrounded the construct, with narrow wobbly catwalks and ladders.\nWhen Amelior Amanitas came to the village of Volkumburgh in 1358 with the goal of reconstructing the fabled stone golem known as Awtawmatawn, he constructed this towering workshop to conduct his work in.Page 7 of this adventure states that the building is \"...unlike all the others [in the village],\" and the following page states that the building, \"shows signs of being recently constructed.\" Together, this would imply that the building had been constructed that year for his purposes.\nWhen a group of adventurers he had hired to deliver one of the golems legs from Suzail arrived at his workshop, they were confronted with a huge bladder that Amelior had inflated and painted to look like a beholder. He was using it hold the place of the Awtawmatawns missing head and laughed riotously at how the adventurers responded to it.\nEventually, the adventurers managed to acquire the rest of the golems fragments for him. A few days then passed, with Amelior sequestered within his workshop and refusing to see anyone. A week later the day finally came for him to complete his construction of the golem and he sent his manservant Erek to invite the adventurers to witness the moment. As he lowered its head on to the body with block and tackle, its eyes began to glow.\nAmeliors manservant Erek shielded him with his body as the building fell around them, saving his masters life but sacrificing his own in the process. After the adventurers found him within the rubble and acquired magic items from him to fight the golem with,\nIn addition to Amelior Amanitas, this workshop was lived in by his manservant Erek and Ameliors many colorful cats."
