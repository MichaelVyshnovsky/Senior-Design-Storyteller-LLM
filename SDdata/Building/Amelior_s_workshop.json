He was using it hold the place of the Awtawmatawn's missing head and laughed riotously at how the adventurers responded to it.\n\nEventually, the adventurers managed to acquire the rest of the golem's fragments for him. A few days then passed, with Amelior sequestered within his workshop and refusing to see anyone. A week later the day finally came for him to complete his construction of the golem and he sent his manservant [[Erek]] to invite the adventurers to witness the moment. As he lowered its head on to the body with block and tackle, its eyes began to glow.\n\nAmelior's manservant Erek shielded him with his body as the building fell around them, saving his master's life but sacrificing his own in the process. After the adventurers found him within the rubble and acquired [[magic item]]s from him to fight the golem with,",
