The '''Pantheistic College of Celestian''' was a temple in the city of [[Bral]] that was dedicated to [[Celestian|Celestian the Star Wanderer]], a [[deity]] originating from [[Greyspace]] that was popular among [[wildspace]] wanderers.

==Location==
This temple was located in the [[Bral/Temple District|Temple District]] of the [[Middle City]] of Bral, east across the road from the [[Pantheist Temple of Tyr]] and north of some [[polygot]] shrines.

==History==
This temple was one of the oldest within the city of Bral, having been established on the [[Rock of Bral]] back during its days of piracy.

==Reputation==
Many [[spelljammer]] captains were known to visit this temple for a blessing before setting sail, due to Celestian being touted by his clergy as a patron of spelljammers.
