The Blue Roan was a boarding house complex in the center of the cramped city of Hlath in the 14 century DR.
This establishment consisted of four buildings and stables that were well-kept.
The Blue Roan offered its patrons rental rooms, along with Cormyr-styled food and stabling of animals, at a high cost. Its rooms were noted for having feathered beds and no vermin to speak of.
Around 1358 DR, a barbarian army from Kara-Tur was threatening the lands of Chondath and Turmish. In the days leading up to the impending battle, the Turmish mercenary Dak Zarre, along with important members of his mercenary company, the Blood Hawks, took up residence in the Blue Roan. One day Zarre came across a group of adventurers and, believing them to be seasoned warriors more fit for commanding an army than Commander Pohidge Plam, invited them to stay with him and his men in the Blue Roan.
