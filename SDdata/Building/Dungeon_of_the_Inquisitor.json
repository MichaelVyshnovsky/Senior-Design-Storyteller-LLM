        "mainbody": "he Dungeon of the Inquisitor was a dungeon in the city of Elturel in the theocracy of Elturgard in the late 15 century DR.\nIt was an extensive and maze-like subterranean complex lying deep under Elturels streets. It included both excavated passages and natural caverns that were occasionally discovered during tunneling. These werent fully explored and where they ultimately led was unknown, but occasionally unusual sounds echoed from them, from the rush of water to the angry roars of unidentified but doubtless large and savage monsters.\nAround 1479 DR, those declared to have broken the law of Elturgard three times were sent into the Dungeon of the Inquisitor. Here, they were punished and set to work mining new tunnels. Sometimes, those on mining detail escaped into the unexplored caves, and were never found again. But the inmate population was always being replenished with fresh convicts."
