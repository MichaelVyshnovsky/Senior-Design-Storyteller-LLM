        "mainbody": "Drowned Buoy was an inn in the Lower Port of Skullport.\nThe Drowned Buoy was a budget-friendly lodging option, offering a large, communal room where sailors on limited funds could set up a hammock or spread out a bedroll. The establishment provided minimal amenities at a cost of 1 copper piece per night. Food and drink was not served on the premises, but could be obtained at nearby establishments like Findlewulfs Galley and the Burning Troll. Security was nonexistent, and patrons were responsible for the safety of their own belongings, as the management assumed no liability for lost or stolen items or companions.\nThe owner of the inn, Wallid \"Wally\" Gumluk, was rumored to supplement his income by cooperating with Zstulkk Ssarmn’s jailers—yuan-ti slavers—and press gangs who sought laborers for rowing decks and ship crews destined for distant locations. This rumored connection has lent the Drowned Buoy a certain notoriety, which made it a favored haunt for those requiring discretion in their dealings, though it remained a less desirable lodging for those wary of Skullport’s darker elements."
