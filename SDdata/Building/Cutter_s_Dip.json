        "mainbody": "utters Dip was a seedy tavern in the Stiltways of Yhaunn.\nThe tavern was located on the third level of the Stiltways near its eastern edge close to the docks, directly above a small courtyard with a well.\nThe tavern was accessed by the assortment of ramps and ladders typical to the Stiltways. The jakes used by the customers were in fact the sides of the nearby walls around it, adding to the general stench of the enclosed area. The building was lined with narrow windows that had the glass knocked from them, while the main door was once a window that was expanded into a rough portal.\nCutters Dip reeked of filth and pipeweed smoke, but was still packed with customers. Bardic music was performed there, but spectating random violence was a much more popular form of entertainment, Despite the rowdiness, there was an unspoken rule that forbid weapons being drawn in the Dip.\nIn 1373 DR, the Sel√ªnite priestess and werewolf Feena Archwood investigated Cutters Dip, hoping to find clues about the temple of Shar.\nThe tavern was frequented by a diverse variety of unscrupulous or unsavory characters, including sailors, craftsmen, merchants, and thugs.\n* The bandits Stag and Drik.\n* The dissolute cultists Keph Thingoleir, Jarull Cartcoster, Starne, Baret, and Talisk.\n* The typical bargoers Kor and Noyle.\n* The partially-insane Lahumbra Sashtyn."
