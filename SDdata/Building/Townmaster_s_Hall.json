        "Structure": "The hall was a single story building made of good quality stone and was well built. The roof was made of wood with a bell tower rising from the back.",

        "History": "When Phandalin was first resettled in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Townmaster's Hall was the office of Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]], although he was known to also conduct official business from his personal home nearby. \n\nAfter only a few years, confidence in the Townmaster had plummeted, and the position was dissolved and replaced with a [[Town Council of Phandalin|Town Council]] consisting of Harbin Wester, [[Sildar Hallwinter]], and [[Halia Thornton]]. While their meeting place continued to be known as the Townmaster's Hall for some time,{{Cite adventurers league/In Volo's Wake|6}} it was eventually renamed to the \"Town Council Hall.\" By the {{YearlinkName|1496}}, the town was undergoing a new political reorganization, and plans had been made to expand the hall to include a mayor's office."
