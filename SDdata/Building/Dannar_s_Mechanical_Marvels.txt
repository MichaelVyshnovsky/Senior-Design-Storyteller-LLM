Dannar's was located next to [[Jaesor's Fineware Porcelain Works]],{{cite web|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=Ed's Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/967970877538275328|accessdate=2018-02-24}}

==Description==
Dannar's Mechanical Marvels was a shop specializing in really expensive [[gnomish]], [[Lantan]]na, and [[dwarf|dwarven]] clockwork devices. Examples were self-striking, wind-up, push-button [[flint and tinder|flint boxes]] and [[electrum]] jewelry boxes inlaid with [[pearl]] and displaying animated adornments, like small clockwork [[dragon]]s that chased their tails around a pop-up vanity [[mirror]]. These tended to wow visitors.
