Dannars Mechanical Marvels was a shop in Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.

Dannars Mechanical Marvels was a shop specializing in really expensive gnomish, Lantanna, and dwarven clockwork devices. Examples were self-striking, wind-up, push-button flint boxes and electrum jewelry boxes inlaid with pearl and displaying animated adornments, like small clockwork dragons that chased their tails around a pop-up vanity mirror. These tended to wow visitors.
