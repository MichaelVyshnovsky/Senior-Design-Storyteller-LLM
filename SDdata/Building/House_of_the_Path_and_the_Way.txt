The House of the Path and the Way was a shrine to the combined faith of the Path and the Way and the Celestial Bureaucracy found in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
It stood in the Middle City of Bral, within the Temple District. It lay between Mainmast Street and Temple Street, and faced onto Temple Square.
A small and humble place, the House saw little in the way of organized worship, but self-contemplation and the pursuit of enlightenment. Priests of any deity were welcomed, but followers of the Path and the Way were likely to explain where their deity served in the Celestial Bureaucracy and correct their views of the multiverse.
Fewer than half a dozen priests and priestesses tended to the shrine. They passed their time in studies and meditation, and did not proselytize or otherwise seek converts.
