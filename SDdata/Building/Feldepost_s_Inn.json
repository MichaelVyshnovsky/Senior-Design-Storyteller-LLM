        "mainbody": "eldeposts Inn was an old establishment located in the town of Beregost on the Sword Coast in the mid-to-late 14 and late 15 centuries DR.\nIt was a quiet, comfortable inn that was a favorite among the elderly.\nThe staff here was careful, considerate, and polite, though service did tend to be slow as a result. Except during days of warmer weather, each room provided a lit fire for the comfort of its guest. Every patron who booked a room was treated to a drawn bath, with water to the temperature of their choosing. Attendants were a handful of kindly old men who said little, but aided customers with bathing if they so requested. This made it appealing to the aged and infirm.\nThe inn hired entertainers such as minstrels, but could not pay them as well as the Jovial Juggler.\nIn the 1480s DR, folk in Beregost liked to start the day with a quiet meal and casual conversation at Feldeposts Inn, making it popular in the mornings.\nThe food served in Feldeposts was quite superior to that found in other establishments. Dishes included such highlights as cheese-and-cucumber buns and mushroom tarts, which were on the house with the purchase of beverages. These were served by the fireplace in the evenings. A fine sherry was also available this was stored in the cellar. Meals were warm and hearty.\nThis old inn drew its name from its founder and first owner, who died sometime before 1366 DR.\nIn the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, the mage Tranzig stayed at the inn, while acting as an intermediary between the bandit-captain Tazok and the Cyricist cleric Mulahey. When confronted by Abdel Adrian, he attacked his party and was killed. Meanwhile, one of the patrons was Marl, a farmer whose son became an adventurer and was killed he got drunk and got into an argument with visiting adventurers. Another drunken patron was Gyllian. A wealthy guest known as Algernon also stayed there.\nThe inn remained in business in the late 1400s DR. One morning in the 1480s DR, the peaceful morningfeast was disrupted by the pseudodragon familiar Hsing, who met some adventurers and enlisted them to search for his mistress SEER in the ruins of the Ulcaster School of Wizardry."
