            "Food and Drink": "The food served in Feldepost's was quite superior to that found in other establishments. Dishes included such highlights as [[cheese]]-and-[[cucumber]] buns and [[mushroom]] [[tart]]s, which were on the house with the purchase of beverages. These were served by the fireplace in the evenings. A fine [[sherry]] was also available; this was stored in the cellar. Meals were warm and hearty."
        },
        "History": "This old inn drew its name from its founder and first owner, who died sometime before [[1366 DR]].\n\nIn the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the [[mage]] [[Tranzig]] stayed at the inn, while acting as an intermediary between the bandit-captain [[Tazok]] and the [[Cyric]]ist [[cleric]] [[Mulahey]]. When confronted by [[Abdel Adrian]], he attacked his party and was killed. Meanwhile, one of the patrons was [[Marl]], a farmer whose son became an adventurer and was killed; he got drunk and got into an argument with visiting adventurers. Another drunken patron was [[Gyllian]]. A wealthy guest known as [[Algernon]] also stayed there.\n\nThe inn remained in business in the late 1400s DR. One morning in the 1480s DR, the peaceful morningfeast was disrupted by the [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]] [[Hsing]], who met some [[adventurer]]s and enlisted them to search for his mistress [[SEER]] in the ruins of the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]]."
