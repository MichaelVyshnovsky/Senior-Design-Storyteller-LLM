'''Tormel Cabinetmaker''' was a furniture shop found in [[Tegal's Mark]] within [[Tasseldale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It featured chests, armoires, dressers, and other furnishings of all kinds crafted by the semi-retired furniture-maker [[Tormel]]. He was widely regarded as the finest crasftsperson of his specialty in all of the [[Dalelands]].

As Tormel wound down his production of goods over the years, and his son [[Senn]] took over responsibilities of the shop, furniture marked with his stamp steadily increased in value. The number of his works that cost over 100 [[gp]] increased just as much.
