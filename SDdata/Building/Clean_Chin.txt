The '''Clean Chin''' was a business in [[Daggerford]] that operated as both a barber shop and a mortuary. It was long-standing institution within the town, having remained in the same location in the [[River Quarter]] for well over 100 years. As of the 1480s [[DR]], the Clean Chin was owned and operated by [[Hunnett Honestone]], the daughter of its founder.

==Location==
It could be found in the [[River Quarter]] of Daggerford, right next to the town's barracks along the eastern perimeter of the drill field.{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Interior==
The ground level of the Clean Chin was partitioned in half, with either side catering to each of the shop's two services. Above the shop was the personal residence of the [[dwarven]] Honestone family.

==Services==
It was quite unique in that the business offered the normal services of a barber and hairstylist, as well as those for the recently deceased.

==History==
The Clean Chin's founder, [[Garick Honestone]], originally ran an undertaker's business called The Fallen Man. It was not particularly successful.

Perplexed as to why [[human|men]] insisted on shaving their faces, Garick decided one day to do the same to one of the bodies in his shop. He was wholly delighted by the entire process and decided to change the name of the establishment and expand the services he offered.

When Garick passed away, his daughter Hunnett took over the business.
