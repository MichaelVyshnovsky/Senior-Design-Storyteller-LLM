The Maiden Danced at Dawn was a small inn located in the hamlet of Dawngleam in Cormyr around 1368 DR.
The rooms of the inn were somewhat cramped. Humidity was an issue and the inn always felt damp.
The inn was renowned, at least locally, for a brandy made in-house called Maidens Kiss. A flask of Maidens Kiss cost 5 silver pieces.
Simple fare consisting of sausage, bread, biscuits, and nut cakes could be had at the rate of 4 copper pieces per plate. A selection of ales and stouts were available, as well as a decent assortment of wines.
