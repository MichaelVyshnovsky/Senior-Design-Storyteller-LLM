'''Graendel's Fine Dwarven Craft''' was a smithy in the town of [[Targos]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was run by [[Graendel Granitefist]]

==Location==
It lay in the western part of town.

==History==
Graendel had come to Icewind Dale with [[Clan Battlehammer]] and the other refugees of the fall of [[Mithral Hall]] in the latter half of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the late 15{{th}} century, he had been working as a smith in Targos since before the other townsfolk's grandparents were born.

==Services==
Graendel forged a variety of metalwork, from pieces of [[armor]] to blades for [[weapon]]s to anchors for the town's fishing boats. He crafted every piece to order and his attention to detail and quality meant they were perfectly fitted to the user's specifications. However, his work was slow as a result, so most people went to one of the regular smiths in Targos for basic tools or quick armor patches. Nevertheless, ''circa'' [[1485 DR]], guards came here all the way from [[Bryn Shander]] to get their armor repaired or adjusted.
