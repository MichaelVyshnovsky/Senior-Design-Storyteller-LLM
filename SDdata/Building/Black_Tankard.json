        "mainbody": "The '''Black Tankard''' was a tavern in [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]], [[Skullport]].",
        "Structure": "The Black Tankard was a dilapidated single story structure of black stone and decaying wood. A large, fire-blackened mug, overflowing with bones—presumably from those who met grim fates within—hung ominously over the door.",
        "Interior": "Under hushed conversations and the sound of patrons sipping bitter, muddy ales, dark schemes were discussed and set in motion. Unfamiliar faces were generally unwelcome; anyone who sought a table would be wise to be prepared to fight to secure and keep their place.",
        "Services": "The beverages were strong, the odor of the patrons even stronger, and the prices reflected the poor quality of the fare—affordable, yet low-grade.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Regulars of the Black Tankard often spoke of a shallow well in the tavern's basement, said to connect to the [[Skullport/Sewers|sewers]] and, eventually, to the dungeons beneath Skullport. It was rumored that the passageways were heavily guarded by both deadly traps and monstrous sentries to deter intruders.",
        "Inhabitants": "The establishment was owned by [[Clant Pitchmaw|Clant \"Silent\" Pitchmaw]], an overweight, toothless, and bald [[human]]. The tavern's three barmaids, who bore a striking resemblance to Clant, were elderly, unattractive, and known for their frequent bouts of rage.\n\nThe tavern was linked to [[Ahmaergo]], the infamous Horned Dwarf, who could be contacted indirectly through runners and his intermediaries, known as \"mouths.\" Many believed that Ahmaergo was the true owner of the Black Tankard, with Silent Clant acting as its public face and manager."
