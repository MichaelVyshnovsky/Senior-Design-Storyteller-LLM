        "mainbody": "Frekang Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot. Its symbol was a horse.\nIt was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Frekang.\nThe Kume Sa Yeti, a terrible pack-hunt by yeti in , saw 280 lamas out of a total of 400 taken by the snow beasts.\nAlso known as the Magical Gates of Frekang, the Gates of Ocean were known to burn those not of the faith but talk to and advise the faithful. In artwork, at least, it was depicted as a grand arch bedecked with jewels and ivory with a great sea below, with unbelievers falling into the water and drowned, unable to pass through.\nThe monks of Frekang Gompa typically wore scarves and colored shawls."
