Marshalls Smithy was a small blacksmiths shop located in the Low City of Bral.
The smithy was located at the intersection of Eel and Hammer Streets.
The shop specialized in metal fittings for spelljammers, such as bolts, nails, and other connectors, and as such, it catered to shipwrights of Bral. The store also provided axeheads and hammerheads primarily for use as tools, but it could also be a source of weapons and arrowheads.
The owner of the shop was a young man named Marshall, who, though his main income came from nails and tools, was rather well-to-do.
