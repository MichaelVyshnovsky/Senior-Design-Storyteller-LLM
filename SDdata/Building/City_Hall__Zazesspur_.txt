'''City Hall''' was the chief administrative building for the [[City Council of Zazesspur]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|16}}

==Location==
This building was situated in the [[Zazesspur/High City/Market District|central Market Square]] of [[Zazesspur]].

==Structure==
City Hall was a very large and ornate structure though its architecture was considered to be archaic by the 1360's DR.{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|17}}
===Interior===
The building was divided into two floors, plus a cellar where some [[barrel]]s of [[wine]] were kept. The lobby was spacious, very [[cathedral]]-like, and decked out in [[marble]] floor of black and white in a [[wikipedia:parquetry|parquetry]] pattern. It had a pointed vault, high overhead, and windows ran down the sides in a [[wikipedia:clerestory|clerestory]] fashion. In each of the southern corners of the building stood stairs leading up to the second floor.

The central room before it was the large council chamber, behind a large pair of beaten [[bronze]] doors, where the Council of Lords sat behind long tables plus a large dais at its northern end. Further beyond this was a carpeted smoking room where the Councillors could relax, a kitchen that was equipped with the best [[stove]]s and utensils available, a pantry where whole [[pig]] carcasses could be hung from [[meat hook]]s alongside shelves of [[fruit]]s and [[cheese]], and a banquet hall where the head of the Council of Lords would hold feasts. This last room was richly decorated, complete with several fine paintings and crystal [[chandelier]]s that hung over its large table.

The second floor of City Hall housed its various offices and the city's court room. This room featured rows of benches for permitted onlookers and at the head of the hall a low dais that ran from wall to wall. The seating at this dais was controlled through a rotation schedule that was as equally rigid and as it was cryptic.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a month after the [[Time of Troubles]] had concluded, the [[Knights of the Shield]] sought to exploit the lingering chaos and the pro-monarchy movement in [[Tethyr]]. [[Inselm Hhune]], a member of the City Council and one of the leaders of the Knights,{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|5}} had spent several years at that point using his natural charisma and ''[[ring of human influence]]'' to amass the trust and support of Zazesspur's citizenry,{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|18}} scheming to have the public pressure the Council of Lords into proclaiming him the "Crown Prince of Zazesspur". The one obstacle to his grander plans was [[Ernest Gallowglass]], the mayor of [[Ithmong]],{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|8}}

Ernest shared similar despotic ambitions for Tethyr,{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|9}} having rose to power through underhanded means and planning to one day take the nation over through military might. But unlike Inshelm, Ernest's ambitions were suspected and put him under surveillance by the [[Company of the Eight]]. In an effort to an incite an uprising against the political opponent, the Knights of the Shield stationed a group of [[wizard]]s in the abandoned [[Freel Manor]], led by former [[Red Wizard]] [[conjurer]] [[Minshak Keseri]], and had them lure various monsters into the area around Ithmong.

The wizards planted ten magical devices called ''[[Thayan beacon]]s'' within the ground, at a distance of {{SI|30|mile|long=yes}} from the city. They also used their magic to summon [[elemental]]s and [[lesser baatezu]] in the areas not covered by the beacons.{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|6}} leading merchants like [[Zarack Shool]] to reroute to the [[Trade Way]].{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|7}} With winter on the horizon, Ernest had no choice but to instate food rationing and consider the possibility of putting martial law into effect, for the threat of riots breaking out loomed overhead. Inselhm planned to stationed himself as a savior after an inevitable uprising, bring Ithmong food supplies and dispatching its monsters. He would then invite Ithmong to join Zazesspur in a "New Kingdom of Tethyr" and believed that the rest of Tethyr would inevitably fall to heel after achieving such a union.

The Company of the Eight was too overstretched at the time to investigate the sudden rise in monsters,{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|6}} After one or two weeks of travel, the adventurers made their way to the Ithmong area and the Freel Manor.{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|15}} After putting an end to all of the wizards housed in the manor, the adventurers rushed to return to Zazesspur.

Having learned of what transpired at the manor through [[scrying]], Inhelm Hhune prepared for the adventurers in advanced and even had wine barrels brought up from City Hall's cell in anticipation of a celebratory banquet. When they finally arrived back in the city they found numerous banners strung across the inns and houses of Zazesspur, all reading "Hhune for Crown Prince" or "Hhune! The People's Choice." The streets were flooded with a massive crowd of people, all converging towards City Hall. When asked what was going on, some citizens said that the Council of Lords was expected to hand rulership over to Lord Hhune within the hour. At the head of the enthusiastic crowd, guards were standing watch at the doors to City Hall, keeping people back, while at the tradesmen's entrance four men-at-arms stood watch. The adventurers managed to find a way to break into the building past the guards and overcome the Knights of the Shield that were stationed outside the doors to the council chamber, leading the irate Speaker [[Aldegust]] to bang his [[gavel]] and demand to know "What is the meaning of this intrusion?".

Making their way inside, the adventurers tried to make their case against Lord Hhune, who denounced them all as liars. When they attempted to pass out what they had discovered at the manor, Lord Hhune lunged at them,{{Cite dungeon/38/A Blight On The Land|18}} The Councillors kept back, screaming in panic.As Inhelm Hhune is still alive in sourcebooks taking place after this adventure, it must be assumed that he managed to escape this fight alive.

In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the ruler of Zazesspur, Pasha [[Balik]], was found in his bed assassinated with Knights of the Shield coins resting on his eyes and covered by a scarf. Following this his residence, the [[Minaret Palace]], began being used by the Council of Lords as a central meeting hall. However, City Hall would continue to see use.

In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Countess [[Zaranda Star]] was brought [[manacles|manacled]] before the Council in City Hall to answer for accusations of sedition.
