        "Services": "The Copper Tap was a locally popular establishment that brewed its own type of award-winning [[ale]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, sailor [[PJ Stubbs]], a friend of [[Bosun Gannet]] of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], found himself in Calimshan and decided to visit The Copper Tap. The discussion he quickly regretted, claiming that its award-winning brew tasted like \"flowers had a wank on his tongue.\" PJ hated the taste so much that the sailor complained about it in a letter sent to Bosun Gannet. Even ten pints of ale failed to wash the taste off."
