The House of Skilled Hands was a temple to Gond, the Lord of All Smiths, found in the city of Tantras in the Vast.
The House of Skilled Hands sat almost at the end of Whistleturn Way, near the citys waterfront.
The House of Skilled Hands was only newly constructed in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, and not yet fully staffed. Torms zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths in the city as "unbelievers".It is not known if or how the House of Skilled Hands was affected by this religious persecution.
Nevertheless, the House of Skilled Hands remained active through to 1367 DR and past 1370 DR.
The House of Skilled Hands once installed a series of cargo-lifting cranes in Tantrass harbor, which Elminster noted were similar to cranes found on another world, and received a copper piece for every load lifted. These allowed the city to quickly move large quantities of freight, and made it a popular trade destination. Such cranes were recent inventions by the mid-1300s, and were also in use in Baldurs Gate and Scardale and other ports.
In 1358 DR, the temple was led by High Artificer Eldorn Mindalar, with nine priests and eighteen lay-followers.
