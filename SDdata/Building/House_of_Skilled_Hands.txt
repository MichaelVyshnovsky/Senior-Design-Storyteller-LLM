The '''House of Skilled Hands''' was a temple to [[Gond]], the Lord of All Smiths, found in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]].

==Location==
The House of Skilled Hands sat almost at the end of Whistleturn Way, near the city's waterfront.

==History==
The House of Skilled Hands was only newly constructed in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], and not yet fully staffed. Torm's zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths in the city as "unbelievers".<ref group="note">It is not known if or how the House of Skilled Hands was affected by this religious persecution.

Nevertheless, the House of Skilled Hands remained active through to [[1367 DR]] and past [[1370 DR]].

==Activities==
The House of Skilled Hands once installed a series of cargo-lifting cranes in Tantras's harbor, which [[Elminster]] noted were similar to cranes found on [[Earth|another world]], and received a [[copper piece]] for every load lifted. These allowed the city to quickly move large quantities of freight, and made it a popular trade destination. Such cranes were recent inventions by the mid-1300s, and were also in use in [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Scardale]] and other ports.

==Inhabitants==
In [[1358 DR]], the temple was led by High Artificer [[Eldorn Mindalar]], with nine priests and eighteen lay-followers.
