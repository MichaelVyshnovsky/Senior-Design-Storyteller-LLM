Lacloss Cremes and Candies was a chocolate factory in Eileanar owned by Laclos, that operated up to the fall of Netheril in .
The confectionary shop sold over 300 types of melts, bonbons, truffles, and other treats. Most of these were designed and made by two key employees—Kiesewetter and Sneyders—who were each paid more than Laclos herself in order to ensure their continued service and loyalty.
