'''Laclos's Cremes and Candies''' was a [[chocolate]] factory in [[Eileanar]] owned by [[Laclos]], that operated up to the fall of [[Netheril]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Services==
The confectionary shop sold over 300 types of melts, [[bonbon]]s, [[truffle (candy)|truffles]], and other treats. Most of these were designed and made by two key employees—[[Kiesewetter]] and [[Sneyders]]—who were each paid more than Laclos herself in order to ensure their continued service and loyalty.
