'''The Gaunt''' was now of the three [[lich]]-castles on the isle of [[Thelve]] in [[Sea of Swords]], just off the shores of [[Candlekeep]].

==Description==
The Gaunt was an impressive tall lone stronghold that menacingly loomed over Thelve. Extensive stone-cut cellars ran underneath the lich-castle.

==Location==
The Gaunt was a local nickname given to the keep located on the island's eastern shores. The castle was built atop a cliff to the north from a natural and unnamed harbor – an inlet directly west of Candlekeep.

==History==
The Gaunt was built using the slave labor of a [[gnome|gnomish]] community that inhabited Thelve. A trio of [[wizard]]s, the so-called [[Twilight Three]], were responsible for the castle's construction and subsequent eradication of the island's gnome population. Eventually, the three mages transformed themselves into liches, and their relationships soured. One of the trio lorded over The Gaunt, while others resided in their own castles across Thelve. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the undead lord of the Gaunt was believed to serve [[Larloch]], an immensely powerful lich.
