The Hell Hounds Muzzle was a tavern in the Lower Heart of Skullport, owned by Grimmbold in the late 14 century DR.
The Hell Hounds Muzzle was a squalid little one-floor shack furnished with upturned barrels and selling potent drinks. It was frequented by cutthroats and assassins. The owner Grimmbold ran an assassins guild out of the tavern, providing their services to the highest bidder.
Grimmbolds associates—Jom Bovine, Esten, and Estens imp familiar, Estryxx—were also members of the assassins guild. They were the only survivors of a fifteen-member cell of Zhentarim agents sent to Skullport in 1369 DR on a suicide mission to investigate the events of Halasters Higharvestide and assassinate Halaster Blackcloak, claiming the Underhalls for the Zhentarim.
Following his missions failure, Grimmbold was stranded in the Prime Material Plane. He established the assassins guild and by 1370 DR, the guild was profitable and growing.
