The '''Hell Hound's Muzzle''' was a tavern in the [[Lower Heart]] of [[Skullport]], owned by [[Grimmbold]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Hell Hound's Muzzle was a squalid little one-floor shack furnished with upturned [[barrel]]s and selling potent drinks. It was frequented by cutthroats and [[assassin]]s. The owner Grimmbold ran an assassin's guild out of the tavern, providing their services to the highest bidder.

==History==
Grimmbold's associates—[[Jom Bovine]], [[Esten]], and Esten's [[imp]] [[familiar]], [[Estryxx]]—were also members of the assassin's guild. They were the only survivors of a fifteen-member cell of [[Zhentarim]] agents sent to Skullport in [[1369 DR]] on a suicide mission to investigate the events of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] and assassinate [[Halaster Blackcloak]], claiming the [[Underhalls]] for the Zhentarim.

Following his mission's failure, Grimmbold was stranded in the [[Prime Material Plane]]. He established the assassin's guild and by [[1370 DR]], the guild was profitable and growing.
