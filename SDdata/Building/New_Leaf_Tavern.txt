The '''New Leaf Tavern''' was the only inn and tavern located in the small but prosperous village of [[New Leaf]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The New Leaf Tavern was a spacious inn with a large common room with a welcoming fireplace, a collection of tables, a hearth, and many casks of libations.

==Atmosphere==
The inn occasionally hosted traveling minstrels ''circa'' [[1374 DR]], namely the sweet-voiced duo of [[Shymon and Scarbunkel]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the innkeeper was a middle-aged bald [[human]] male with blonde beard and mustache. He shared no love for [[Luskan]] liked to share a story of how one shifty Luskanite stayed at the inn but evidently did not stick around.
