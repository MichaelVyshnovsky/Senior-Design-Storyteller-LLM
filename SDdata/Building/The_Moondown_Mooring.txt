'''The Moondown Mooring''' was a small [[inn]] found in the village of [[Dawngleam]] in [[Cormyr]] around [[1368 DR]].

==Activites==
The Moondown Mooring was a small comfortable inn that was on the verge of drastic change since the owner began raising prices and quickly expanding the size of the inn in preparation for Dawngleam's "golden age." A drafty addition was tacked onto the back of the inn near the stables, allowing the fresh smell of [[horse]]s to intrude on anyone unlucky enough to stay in the newly added rooms.

Despite all of this, the food was still hot and tasty.
