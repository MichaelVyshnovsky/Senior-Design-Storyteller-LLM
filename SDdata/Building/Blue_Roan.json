        "mainbody": "The '''Blue Roan''' was a boarding house complex in the center of the cramped city of [[Hlath]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "This establishment consisted of four buildings and stables that were well-kept.",
        "Services": "The Blue Roan offered its patrons rental rooms, along with [[Cormyr]]-styled food and stabling of animals, at a high cost. Its rooms were noted for having feathered beds and no [[vermin]] to speak of.",
        "History": "Around [[1358 DR]], a barbarian army from [[Kara-Tur]] was threatening the lands of [[Chondath]] and [[Turmish]]. In the days leading up to the impending battle, the Turmish [[mercenary]] [[Dak Zarre]], along with important members of his mercenary company, the [[Blood Hawks]], took up residence in the Blue Roan. One day Zarre came across a group of [[adventurer]]s and, believing them to be seasoned warriors more fit for commanding an army than Commander [[Pohidge Plam]], invited them to stay with him and his men in the Blue Roan."
