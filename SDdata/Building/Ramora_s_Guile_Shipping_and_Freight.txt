'''Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight''' was a shipping business in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was a modest one-story building with a basement.

==Services==
Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was known for its selective business practices. It rarely accepted freight from walk-in customers, consistently claiming full capacity. It was in fact a front for small-time smuggling operations, which specialized in attaching contraband to the undersides of vessels using watertight containers. Smuggled goods were securely stored on-site, protected by four trained [[war dog]]s and a series of magical and mechanical [[trap]]s.

As of [[1370 DR]], Ramora's Guile focused primarily on transporting [[smokepowder]] for [[the Brigadier]].

==Inhabitants==
Ramora's Guile Shipping and Freight was owned by [[Sheila Kells]]. Despite numerous attempts by the Pirate Tyrant, [[Misker]], to take over her operations, Sheila had thus far managed to resist them, though many believed it was only a matter of time before she was forced to align with his organization.

In support of their arrangement, the Brigadier provided Sheila with an [[enchanted]] [[dagger]] for personal defense and a small enchanted crystal globe, which she wore on a chain around her neck. Should the globe be shattered, it signaled the Brigadier, who would then arrive fully armed to defend his assets at Ramora's.
