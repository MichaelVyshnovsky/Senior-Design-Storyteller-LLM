==Location==
The Gentle Mermaid sat in the western section of Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. It lay in the center of a courtyard surrounded by [[Sulmor Street]], [[Hassantyr's Street]], [[Copper Street]], and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]].

==Description==
The main room sported a high roof illuminated by constantly shifting lights.

==Inhabitants==
The Gentle Mermaid was owned by [[Jhant Daxer]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Defenses==

==History==
The structure was originally the villa of a noble house. It was founded by Lady [[Shaeroon Brossfeather]] who owned the establishment for many years before her death.

==Rumors & Legends==
A mysterious "death card", the result of a crazed [[wizard]]'s [[curse]], surfaced during games from time to time. The unfortunate gambler who drew the death card would be attacked by a [[scythe]]-wielding vengeful [[spirit]] and potentially slain. The structure's many turrets were adorned with lifelike stone heads which according to tavern tales sometimes spoke to passersby.<ref>Forgotten Realms novel, Thornhold by Elaine Cunningham.
