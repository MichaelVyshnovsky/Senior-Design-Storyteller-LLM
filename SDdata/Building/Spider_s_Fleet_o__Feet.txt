'''Spider's Fleet o' Feet''' was a courier business in [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]], [[Skullport]].

==Description==
Spider's Fleet o' Feet was owned by [[Spider (individual)|Spider]].

==Services==
Spider's Fleet o' Feet offered a range of courier services. The cost for delivering verbal messages, limited to 50 to 100 words, was 1 [[cp]] per word. Written letters and personal missives were priced between 5 [[sp]] and 5 [[gp]], while small package deliveries ranged from 1 to 10 gp. Should Spider decided the delivery was particularly dangerous or risky for his couriers, the cost of the service doubled or even tripled, reflecting the added peril involved in the task. Spider's delivery network was highly regarded in Skullport for its efficiency and reliability, despite the dangerous environment in which it operated.

To ensure the success of these deliveries and to protect his crew from potential threats, Spider employed a strategic system: he always sent two additional runners beyond the required number. These extra couriers acted as decoys or unseen escorts, providing cover for the real courier.

Spider's couriers were all [[fighter]]s and [[rogue]]s. They typically wore [[leather armor]] or none at all, and they were equipped with [[short sword]]s and [[dagger]]s. Some of these couriers acquired, or stole, magical items—such as ''[[gauntlets of climbing]]'', ''[[bracers of brachiation]]'', or ''[[rings of free action]]''—to assist them in their duties.
