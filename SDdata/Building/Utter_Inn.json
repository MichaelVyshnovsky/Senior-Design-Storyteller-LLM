        "mainbody": "he Utter Inn was found in the small settlement of Bogbrook in Cormyr.\nFor those whod visited this inn, its name probably reminded them of the utterdark wine served there. In addition to the wine, the inn also served warm ale and cider, which were both well received.\nThe Utter Inn suffered from poor illumination, small rooms, and a damp atmosphere, making it a difficult place to spend the night. The smell of mildew permeated each and every room."
