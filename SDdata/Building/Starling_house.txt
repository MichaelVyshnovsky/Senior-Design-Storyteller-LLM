'''Starling house''' was one of the houses in the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. It was inhabited by the [[Starling (family)|Starling]] family.

==Location==
Located near the edge of the village, the Starling house was located next to [[Tarmas' home]].

==Structure==
Like the other houses in West Harbor, the Starling house was wooden.

==Interior==
This was the largest building in West Harbor. It was composed of a children's bedroom, a hall, and a living room.

==History==
[[Retta Starling]] and the [[Kalach-Cha]]'s friend, [[Bevil Starling]] (as well as his siblings), lived in this house. When [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]]s attacked the village in [[1374 DR]], some of the duergar went into the house. The Kalach-Cha could've helped Bevil to come to his house and attack the duergar, with the help of his dogs: [[Muttonchop]], [[Locke (dog)|Locke]], and [[Nasher (dog)|Nasher]].
