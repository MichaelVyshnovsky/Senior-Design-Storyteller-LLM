The '''Tower of Mystery''' or '''Tower of Mysteries''' was a temple to [[Mystra]], the Lady of Mysteries, in [[Saerloon]] in [[Sembia]].

==Leadership==
Around [[1370 DR]], the temple was led by Mage Arcane [[Tanthala]], who was assisted by Lord of Mystery [[Telornym]].

==History==
In [[Eleint]] of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], [[Tunaster Dranik]], an itinerant [[cleric]] of Mystra, journeyed to the Tower of Mystery in search of an explanation or assistance regarding the mysterious [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] in neighboring [[Cormyr]]. He believed someone there would be able to [[teleport]] him back to Wheloon if needed.
