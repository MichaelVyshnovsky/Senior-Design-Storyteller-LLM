The '''Empty Fish''' was a [[tavern]] found just outside the city of [[Westgate]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Location==
The tavern was located outside of the [[West Gate (Westgate)|West Gate]] along an unnamed crossroads.

==Activities==
Locals avoided this tavern because of its ridiculous prices which were targeted at travelers who didn't know any better. Given its location, the Empty Fish was a popular spot to have anonymous meetings.
