        "Location": "This guildhall was located in [[Jhalal Drudach]], in [[Jhaapir Sabban]] of [[Quill Ward]].",
        "Structure": "The building was notable for its unique construction. It was pentagonal, with a four-story minaret at each of its five corners. The minarets were glazed in an off-white color with patterns in the brick to make them appear like [[candle]]s. The tops of the \"candles\" contained [[Continual flame|everburning flames]]."
