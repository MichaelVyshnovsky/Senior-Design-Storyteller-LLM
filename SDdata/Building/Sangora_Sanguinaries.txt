Sangora Sanguinaries was a merchant stall at the Corpse Market in the Shadowfell city of Evernight. Its proprietor was the vampire Sangora. 
The stall predominately sold cups of warm blood to vampire clientele. However, Sangora was a very well-informed resident of Evernight and so also sold "ephemeral" things like information and directions. She answered questions for 20 gp each, making her knowledge the more profitable side of her business.
