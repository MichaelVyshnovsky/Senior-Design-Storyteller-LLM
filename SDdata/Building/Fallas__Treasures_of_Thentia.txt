Fallas Treasures of Thentia was a shop that dealt in fine silks on the grand Promenade of Suzail in Cormyr.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the store was ran by Fallas, a merchant of Thentia. Fallas Treasures sold delicate laced items of clothing, lingerie, expensive silks, sashes, costume jewelry, and other fanciful finery.
The shop faced the Tower of the Royal Magician across the Promenade and neighbored a merchants drinking club called Bindles.
