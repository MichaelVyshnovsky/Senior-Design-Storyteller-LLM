The '''Temple of the Three''' was a place of worship dedicated to three goddesses, [[Chauntea]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Mystra]], in the city of [[Mulsantir]] in [[Rashemen]].

{{quote|'' Yes, a temple of a sort. Here, we worship the triune goddess, amidst the rushing of the river, the smells of the grass and the trees and the water.''|[[Sheva Whitefeather]]}}

==Description==
The Temple of the Three was an open-air place of worship. It was a circular plot of fenced land that overlooked [[River Mulsantir]] from atop a high-rising slope of the upper Mulsantir. The temple consisted of three statues dedicated to each of the goddesses, with a shrine assigned to each. The worshipers left tithes for Chauntea, Mielikki, and Mystra atop the shrines. At the center, between the statues, stood a large tent decorated with an intricate Rashemi design.

The stature of Mystra bore the name ''Mistress of Magic and Mother of Mysteries'' and depicted a woman in a flowing dress hiding a [[mage]]'s [[staff]]. Her altar was a large wicker basket and a jug. The stature of the Earthmother was an unnamed woman in a simple dress with a bowl of fruit and vegetable as offerings in front of it. The stature of Mielikki depicted a [[bow]]-wielding woman with the altar filled with [[bread]]. The statue's name read ''Our Lady of the Forest.''

==Services==
The [[wychlaran]] who attended the Temple of the Three offered a small selection of healing and magical protective items and [[potion]]s in exchange for donations to the churches.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, three wychlaran were attending the series of the three: [[Sheva Whitefeather]] â€“ an [[Othlors]], and one of the leaders of Mulsantir; [[Katya]], a young seventeen-year-old witch who was in charge of the temple's goods; and [[Kazimika Vadoi]], a stern and regal witch. The three wychlaran met [[Kalach-Cha]] and allowed the hero to stand against the army of spirit [[Okku]] and his army of [[telthor]]. The spirit army besieged Mulsantir in an attempt to slay Kalach-Cha and the Spirit-Eater entity possessing the adventurer.
