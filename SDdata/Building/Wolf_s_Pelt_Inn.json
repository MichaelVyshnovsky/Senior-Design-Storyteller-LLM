        "Structure": "The building faced [[Maer Dualdon]] so fishermen could see the front door from the lake. On the outside, the inn looked worn out but this was only because of the harsh weather of the [[Icewind Dale]] region. The inn itself was a one-story building, approximately 40 by 80 ft. in size.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Wolf's Pelt Inn had a barroom, common room, private rooms, storage, and a kitchen.\n\nThe barroom was always filled with smoke, loud clients' voices, especially in the evening when the fishermen finished their day's work. The large warm hearth was located in the center of the northern wall. The bar was next to a fireplace in the northwestern corner of the room.\n\nThe common room (5 [[sp]] a night) contained 26 cots, half of which was almost always occupied. The room had a faint smell of sweat and woodsmoke lingering in the air, but the room itself was always clean. The hearth in the room provided warmth and light, even though additional candles were scattered around the place.\n\nThe inn had only 3 private rooms (1 [[gp]] a night). Each had two beds, a table, a bureau by the north wall with burning [[incense]] on it.\n\nThe storage room contained most of the inn's preserved foods, like [[salted meat]], [[cheeses]], [[ale]], [[fish]], etc.\n\nThe kitchen was not a big space that usually had one or all of the Winters children working there.\n\nThe inn's clientele consisted mostly of tough leathery-skinned fishermen and harbor-working folks of the town who cared mostly about food and drink after a long day, and not gossip nor adventurers."

        "Staff": "''Circa'' 1369 DR the inn was run by Kalas Winters, he greeted the customers, gladly exchanged stories of adventure, and manned the bar. His wife [[Beartrid Winters]] loudly and warmly greeted most of the arriving folks, while flirting with them but stayed close to the kitchen to keep an eye on her daughter. [[Sims Winters]] was a 13-year old boy helping his mother and sister around the inn. [[Dorthy Winters]] was a 17-year old daughter who was put to work in the kitchen. Young lasses [[Tairis]] and [[Parcilla]] waited the tables.",
        "History": "Around [[1369 DR]], the building was owned by [[Kalas Winters]]. The same year [[Boswell Peddywinkle]] (secretly [[Celerum]] the Black) used the inn to house his hired caravan guards and adventurers on their search for the [[Accursed Tower]] of [[Damien Morienus]]."
