        "mainbody": "The '''Leaf in Root''' was a [[tobacco]] and pipe shop located within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was famous across [[North Faerûn|north]] and [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] provided by the Leaf's secretive and often-absent proprietor, [[Oscar Sodhome]]. People came from throughout [[the Vast]], and lands as far away as the [[Dalelands]] and [[Sembia]], for the shop's unique products.\n\nThe red brick building was located on the corner of [[Rhabie Promenade]] and [[Dragonscale Street]] in the neighborhood of [[Swordspoint]].",
        "Description": "No products within the store were labeled with a price tag, as Oscar expected his customers to name their cost for what they wanted. If an acceptable or high price was offered, Oscar or Chug would agree, though not without a moment of false reservation. The [[halfling]] duo were ready hagglers, and would never go under their set prices.\n\nBusy from dawn until dusk, the shop featured a noticeboard where Ravenian folk could post job requests for mercenaries, adventurers, or the many other hirelings that were rampant throughout Ravens Bluff. Oscar believed this greatly helped to bring in new customers and patrons.",
