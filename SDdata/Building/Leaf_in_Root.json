        "mainbody": "The Leaf in Root was a tobacco and pipe shop located within the Temple District of Ravens Bluff during the mid–14 century DR. It was famous across north and central Faerûn provided by the Leafs secretive and often-absent proprietor, Oscar Sodhome. People came from throughout the Vast, and lands as far away as the Dalelands and Sembia, for the shops unique products.\nThe red brick building was located on the corner of Rhabie Promenade and Dragonscale Street in the neighborhood of Swordspoint.\nNo products within the store were labeled with a price tag, as Oscar expected his customers to name their cost for what they wanted. If an acceptable or high price was offered, Oscar or Chug would agree, though not without a moment of false reservation. The halfling duo were ready hagglers, and would never go under their set prices.\nBusy from dawn until dusk, the shop featured a noticeboard where Ravenian folk could post job requests for mercenaries, adventurers, or the many other hirelings that were rampant throughout Ravens Bluff. Oscar believed this greatly helped to bring in new customers and patrons.\nOscar ran the shop with the help of his assistant Chug, a heavy-drinking, shield-loving, and particularly pessimistic halfling. \nThe Leaf in Root offered common pipes, carved from briar, or much to Oscars chagrin, clay, as well as the \"Sodhomes Specials\". These highly demanded pipes crafted by Oscar were carved from a secret root, only known to him. Most were made to his design and liking, but if given enough gold, he would create custom pieces.\nTobaccos of all sorts were commonly sold within the store. These ranged from common varieties to the more exotic. It was known to the shops patrons that Oscar could get his hands on just about any variety of leaf found across Faerûn. Specially ordered types of tobacco would take a month or two to arrive at the Leaf in Root and custom-crafted pipes could take anywhere from five weeks to eight months, depending on the intricacy and detail of the carving.\nIn addition to their unique types of tobacco, and handcrafted pipes, the Leaf sold various accessories for the avid smoking enthusiast including tinderboxes, flint, tobacco and herb tins and pouches, as well as pipe stands."
