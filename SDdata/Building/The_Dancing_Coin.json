        "mainbody": "The '''Dancing Coin''' was a moneychanging house located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The house was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] on [[Zhent Avenue]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The Dancing Coin was owned by a man named [[Andalias]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.",
        "Defenses": "Since upwards of 75,000 [[gp]] worth of currency was kept in the Dancing Coin at any given time, Andalias took security seriously. He had a [[wizard]] create a pair of [[clay golem]]s that were under his control thanks to an enchanted ring he wore at all times. [[Zhentilar]] patrols made it a point to stay close to the Dancing Coin as well, perhaps because of well-placed bribes."
