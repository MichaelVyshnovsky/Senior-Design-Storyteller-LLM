It was owned by the famous [[Waterdhavian]] merchant [[Furjur|Furjur the Flippant]] though ran in his absence by six young shop-keeps.\n\nThough it was more of a general or specialty goods store, the ''Flying Carpet'' was the only place locals of [[Sundabar Vale|the vale]] could visit to find miscellaneous, replacement items they might need in a hurry, save for a visit to [[Silverymoon]].\n\nThe ''Flying Carpet'' was full of items that were far out-of-place in [[the north]] such as ''[[brass lamp]]s'', revealing clothing woven from thin fabric, beaded curtains and even an actual old, dusty ''[[flying carpet]]'', which was available for sale at the low cost of 45,000 [[gp]]."
