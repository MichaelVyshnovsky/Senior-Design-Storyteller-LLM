        "mainbody": "he Field-Gates were the westernmost fortified gates of Suzail, the capital city of Cormyr.\nThe Field-Gates stood on the road that stretched from the citys open-air market plaza, westwards, past Suzails burial garden of the Fields of the Dead, and towards the Storm Horns.\nNightly, the Field-Gates allowed passage of Suzails dung-loaded carts, hauled by Sundarl Nightsoils all through the night. The carts destination was almost two miles outside the city walls â€“ a fertilizer field and a lime pit for disposal of Suzails waste.\nJust like the Eastgate, the Field-Gates were citadel-like fortifications that offered solid defenses to Suzails west entrance. The gates were guarded by a garrison of the Purple Dragons and its gatehouse maintained a detailed log of known spies and other individuals banned from entering the capital of Cormyr."
