'''''Balduran Looks out to Sea''''' was a statue in the [[Tumbledown]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
This sculpture depicted the founder of Baldur's Gate, [[Balduran]], looking out towards the [[River Chionthar]] to the west. The statue was located on a cliff southeast of the [[Cliffgate]]. It stood twice as tall as the real Balduran.

At sunrise on [[Hammer 1]], the first day of the year, the statue flickered and shifted its posture in the blink of an eye. It might point, stand with hands on hips, or look through a [[spyglass]], though always facing in the general direction of west, varying by 30Â°. It was believed that the statue pointed towards the location of Balduran, who was theorized might still be alive and living somewhere to the west.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, the hand of the statue of Balduran, as well as others, was severed by [[The Guild|Guild]] rogues. Some time later, bored noble youths did the same to the [[Beloved Ranger]]. The [[Flaming Fist]] conducted a thorough search of the region for the hand, particularly stores known to purchase stolen goods, such as the [[Calim Jewel Emporium]]. However, nothing turned up. [[Horgold Hadru]], a local potter, took in the noble youths who had vandalized the Beloved Ranger, as he owed one of the patriar families.

Sometime in the mid-to-late 1400s DR, a knight of [[Oghma]] attempted to travel in the direction of Balduran Looks out to Sea in an attempt to find the truth of where the statue pointed to. Soon, the knight came across a cylindrical stone structure in a wooded area a few miles to the west of Baldur's Gate. A smaller statue of Balduran stood atop the building, facing back towards Balduran Looks out to Sea, while an open doorway led to a staircase descending into the ground. But all the knight's attempts to enter the structure failed when they were blocked by an unknown magic in the form of a pattern of magical lights. Returning to Baldur's Gate, the knight assembled a group of scholars and returned to the structure. However, by the time they returned, it was no longer there. This structure was subsequently found again three more times in a similar fashion, but in different locations. However, no one was ever been able to enter. The popular theory was that this structure was the tomb of Balduran, so it was dubbed [[Balduran's Tomb]].
