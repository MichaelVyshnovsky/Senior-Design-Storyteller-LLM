Sailors Crossing was a harborside cobblestone plaza decorated with a fountain at its center, located in the city of Baldurs Gate.
The plaza stood on the crossing of several streets at the edge of Eastway, a single city block northwest from the Low Lantern and south of Fishers Warf. The street called Admirals Way began on the next block to the southwest.
The plaza smelled of salty sea breeze and spayed water mist from its tiered fountain with several copper coins in its waters.

In the summer of the , on Kythorn 19, the Sailors Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. A dead elf minstrel wearing a glued-on beard was found dead at the fountains base. A large anchor was embedded in the mans chest. The adventurer and detective named Tav begin the investigation of the murder on Kythorn 20, later returning to the crime scene on Kythorn 22. By that time, the body had been removed by the Flaming Fists and sent to the Harborside Hospital with only a couple of poleaxe-armed guards keeping an eye on the site.
