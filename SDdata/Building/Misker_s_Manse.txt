'''Misker's Manse''' was a private residence in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
Misker's Manse was a three-story mansion in good condition. The mansion itself was crafted from purple and green stone, designed to appear as though it grew naturally rather than through construction.

==Interior==
The interior of the mansion was reportedly filled with rare and strange art that reflected the [[Misker]]'s alien aesthetics, and its floors were notably devoid of ramps or stairways, rendering much of it inaccessible to those unable to levitate or fly.
