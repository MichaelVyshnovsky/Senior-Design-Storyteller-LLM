The Old Dwarf was a long-standing tavern in the capital city of Cormyr, Suzail.
The Old Dwarf stood on Suzails Promenade, across the avenue from Cormyrs Royal Court. The old tavern had deep wine cellars, one of which hid passage to Castle Obarskyr. Each of the oaken wine casks was illuminated by its own candle. A heavy iron spell-warded gate separated the cells from the passageways to the castle.
The Old Dwarf existed as early as several human generations before the 14 century DR, and it was believed that the tavers wine cellars were dug out by its original owner the "Old Dwarf" himself. It was also believed that Azoun Obarskyr IV, his father, and an unknown number of Obarskyrs before them, used the passage between the castle and the tavern during their numerous amorous excursions.
As of the , Old Dwarfs entrance was illuminated by a hanging lantern above it.
