'''The Old Dwarf''' was a long-standing tavern in the capital city of [[Cormyr]], [[Suzail]].

==Description==
The Old Dwarf stood on Suzail's [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], across the avenue from [[Cormyr's Royal Court]]. The old tavern had deep wine cellars, one of which hid passage to [[Castle Obarskyr]]. Each of the [[oak]]en wine [[cask]]s was illuminated by its own [[candle]]. A heavy iron spell-warded gate separated the cells from the passageways to the castle.

==History==
The Old Dwarf existed as early as several human generations before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and it was believed that the taver's wine cellars were dug out by its original owner the "Old Dwarf" himself. It was also believed that [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], his father, and an unknown number of Obarskyrs before them, used the passage between the castle and the tavern during their numerous amorous excursions.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Old Dwarf's entrance was illuminated by a hanging [[lantern]] above it.
