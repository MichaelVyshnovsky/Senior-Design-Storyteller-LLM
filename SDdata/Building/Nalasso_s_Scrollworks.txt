Nalassos Scrollworks was a shop in the city of Suzail in Cormyr that specialized in scrolls and scroll-related paraphernalia.
This shop was located along Torch Street.
Nalassos often purchased large hollow bones from the business Sundarl Nightsoils. With these bones the proprietors would fashion fine scroll tubes, chased with silver mounts and caps.
