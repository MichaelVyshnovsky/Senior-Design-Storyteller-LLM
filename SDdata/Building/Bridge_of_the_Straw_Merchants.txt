The Bridge of the Straw Merchants was actually a pair of bridges located in the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The bridges were located in the southern section of the Furdah Rustauk District in southern Dhaztanar near the shore of Gbor Nor. They provided crossings for foot traffic over a pair of canals flowing toward the Madinat in the north.
