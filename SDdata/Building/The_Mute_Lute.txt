The Mute Lute was a shop located in Neverwinter in the 14 century DR.
The Mute Lute was located in the northwestern end of the Blacklake District, just across the street from Jaesors Fineware Porcelain Works, in the intersection between Hantors Lane at the Street Of Storms.
The Mute Lute was popular across the Realms for its well-crafted lutes. The shop was built around an old oak tree. The Mute Lute got the name for a spell its owner, Rebeth Laereeryn, could cast to silence all sound within its walls.
Common lutes at the Mute Lute cost 900 gp, while custom-made lutes could cost up to 3000 gp.
