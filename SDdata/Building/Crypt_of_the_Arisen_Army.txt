The '''Crypt of the Arisen Army''' was a major center of worship for followers of [[Velsharoon]].

==Description==
The crypt was hidden along the cavern walls within [[Skull Gorge]].

==Inhabitants==
Baron [[Vjurn Blacktower]] led the clergy of Velsharoon, called [[Cryptskulls]] in [[1367 DR]].

==History==
The temple was founded at the site of one of Velsharoon's abodes when he was mortal known as the [[Forgotten Crypt]].

==Defenses==
In addition to the clergymen, a army of [[undead]] controlled the entire valley leading to the subterranean temple.
