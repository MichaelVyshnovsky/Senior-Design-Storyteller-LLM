The Crypt of the Arisen Army was a major center of worship for followers of Velsharoon.
The crypt was hidden along the cavern walls within Skull Gorge.
Baron Vjurn Blacktower led the clergy of Velsharoon, called Cryptskulls in 1367 DR.
The temple was founded at the site of one of Velsharoons abodes when he was mortal known as the Forgotten Crypt.
In addition to the clergymen, a army of undead controlled the entire valley leading to the subterranean temple.
