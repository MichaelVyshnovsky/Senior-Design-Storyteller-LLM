'''Eastway Expeditions''' was a shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] that specialized in selling equipment to those who sought exploration or adventure, particularly those ''en route'' to the land of [[Chult]]. It was run by the rather shrewd businessperson, [[Scalm Shilvan]].

==Services==
The Eastway shop offered a modest selection of adventuring gear, which was tailored to the exploration of a jungle biome. Many items were given dubious descriptors, such as "jungle-proof" or "[[dinosaur]]-resistant."

==History==
[[File:Eastway.jpg|thumb|''The location of the Eastway Expeditions.'']]
When the city of Baldur's Gate formed a trade agreement with the merchant princes of [[Port Nyanzaru]], business at Eastway Expeditions skyrocketed. A great many inexperienced adventurers rapidly outfitted themselves and met an untimely end in the dangerous jungles of Chult.

After the death of several [[patriar]] youth, the Baldurian government imposed a 10-day waiting period on any goods sold at the shop. Scalm, in turn, began referring her clientele to those who sought to rapidly form new crews and earned extra [[gold]] by helping folks get out of the city very quickly, regardless of their destination.
