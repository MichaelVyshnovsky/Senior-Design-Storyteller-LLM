'''Castle Lutwill''' was the fortified manor of Baron [[Lutwill]], one of the many petty barons of [[Tethyr]] during that country's [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum period]].

==Location==
The castle was located {{SI|3|furlong|k|long=yes}} east of the village of [[Masamont]], which was north of the [[Sulduskoon River]].

==Structure==
The castle's [[wikipedia:Keep|keep]] was made of stone and stood four stories tall. It sat upon a [[Wikipedia:Motte|motte]], an artificial hill, surrounded by a courtyard with {{SIAdj|12|ft|adj=high}} walls. These walls were made of dressed stone and had sloped roofs but no [[Wikipedia:Crenelation|crenelations]]. The wall itself was surrounded by a ditch partially filled with trash. A permanent bridge of wood crossed the ditch leading to the [[oak]]en gate.

==Interior==
The keep was [[candle]]-lit. Curved staircases connected the floors.

The second floor contained straw-stuffed pallets for sleeping for the guards.

The top floor of the keep was a penthouse, separated from the rest of the keep by a heavy trapdoor. This was the baron's chambers. It was decorated with smelly animal pelts and tapestries. [[Silk]]en pillows served for reclining. The windows of penthouse were thick, wavy glass and [[iron]] instead of arrow-slits like on the floors below.

==Defenses==
A detachment of trained guards, wearing [[steel]] [[helmet]] caps and [[hauberk]]s, defended the castle.

==Inhabitants==
The castle was the home of Baron Lutwill. His chamberlain was a man named [[Whimberton]].

==History==
In the middle of the month of [[Eleasias]], in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Baron Lutwill sent out a proclamation doubling the taxes on his subjects, which included the villages of [[Tweyar]], [[Pansemil]], [[Dunod]], and Masamont. The villagers were at the time under training by [[Star Protective Services]]. Some of the villagers wished to fight back, and [[Zaranda Star]] agreed to aid them. She led them on a scouting party to Masamont to determine the strength of Castle Lutwill's fortifications.

Around seven days later, on the same evening when earlier in the day Baron Lutwill had sent out half his soldiers to collect the taxes, [[Farlorn Half-Elven]] and [[Golden Dawn]] approached the castle from the east, disguised as [[Fyadros]], the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, and [[Zizzy]], the Wonder Horse. "Fyadros" convinced Whimberton to let them stay the night to entertain the keep's inhabitants.

Well after midnight, Zaranda led her band of 50&mdash;including the members of Star Protective Services, [[Balmeric]]'s mercenaries, and half of her trainees from among the local villages who had been selected by lot from volunteers&mdash;to the castle. She muffled the hoofs of the [[horse]]s, and they reached the walls without incident. Farlorn lowered a rope to her over the wall, and she climbed up, and padded [[ladder]]s were used for the raiders to climb up. Farlorn had killed the two sentries. Nevertheless, someone spotted them and sounded an alarm, and a [[crossbow]]man from among Lutwill's soldiers killed one of the peasants climbing a ladder, beginning the battle.

Zaranda sent a [[fireball]] into the barracks below, then ordered [[Shield of Innocence]] to lead a group down to it to fight any survivors of the magic blast. The gate was opened to let the rest of her raiders into the courtyard, as [[Vander Stillhawk]] tried to take out the crossbowmen shooting from the slit windows of the keep. Zaranda rushed down to the gate of the keep and used a [[Knock|spell]] to open the massive door.

Once inside, Zaranda fought her way upstairs with her [[saber]] ''[[Crackletongue]]'' and her [[spell]]s. Meanwhile, from higher up, Whimberton used a [[magic item|magic ball]] to send [[lightning bolt]]s on the invaders in the courtyard. Zaranda rushed up to the penthouse, where Lutwill and Whimberton awaited her. She fought Lutwill, a large man with a double-headed [[battleaxe]], but Whimberton trapped her with a [[hold person|holding]] spell. A spell cast by [[Chenowyn]] caused Whimerton to fall through one of the windows to his death, freeing Zaranda from her paralysis and allowing her to cover the baron's head with a [[wolf]]'s pelt and stab him through the face.

In the end, Zaranda's invaders took the castle with a loss of ten of her volunteers.
