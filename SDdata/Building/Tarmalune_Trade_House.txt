The '''Tarmalune Trade House''', was a trade cartel from [[Tarmalune]] that operated out of [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The Trade House had a large warehouse located in the [[Docks District (Neverwinter)|Docks District]] to store their wares. They also had an open-air auction post located in the [[Protector's Enclave]].

The Tarralune merchants used a unique type of currency, [[Tarmalune Trade Bars]], which were made of [[silver]] and were imprinted with Tarralune trade markings. The bars could be exchanged for equipment, mounts, adventuring contracts, and other valuable items.

==History==
Around [[1479 DR]], once Neverwinter's Docks were repaired, members of a trade cartel from the [[Laerakond]]an city of Tarmalune of the [[Windrise Ports]] arrived in Neverwinter and arranged trade deals with [[Dagult Neverember]], in the hopes of creating permanent trade ties between their homeland and [[Faerûn]], and to outmaneuver their rivals from another Laerakondan city, [[Lylorn]], who had landed in [[Luskan]] with similar goals.

Unrelated to the intrigues of Neverwinter, the Tarralune merchants provided a peaceful place to make trade deals and soon became vital for trade in Neverwinter, especially among [[adventurer]]s. They also sought out trade deals with nobles and merchants from [[Waterdeep]].
