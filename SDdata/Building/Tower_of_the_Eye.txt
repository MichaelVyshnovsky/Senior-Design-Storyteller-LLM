The '''Tower of the Eye''' was a temple of [[Helm]] in the Temple District of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==History==
In the [[1317 DR|Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]], the High Guardian of the time wrote about the [[Plague of Dragons]] and the [[dragon]] that spread the diseases around the [[Inner Sea]], telling of theories surrounding them and events in other lands. The current [[Thultyrl]] recruited the temple corps to help defend the city. The High Guardian's writings were kept in the Tower's ecclesiastic archives.

In [[Marpenoth]] of the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], when Procampur was struck by the [[featherlung]] plague, clerics of Helm treated the sick within the Temple District.

==Organization==
By [[1357 DR]] and through 1367 DR, it was led by High Guardian [[Endra Mathlyn|Endra "Watchever" Mathlyn]], with 18 subordinate priests and 24 lay-followers.
