        "Description": "A one-story tavern of shabby quality yet average prices, the Broken Pike's patron were a motley crew of fences, pirates, and smugglers. They were a tight-knit bunch who saw all strangers as targets and prey. One had to stay alert and ready for tricks or violence.\n\nSome regulars used the Broken Pike as a venue to plan their crimes, from theft to murder to worse deeds. It was also a meeting place for the [[Unseen]], so some regular patrons were [[doppelganger]]s. The [[duergar]] fence [[Thurn Blackskull]] could be found here many afternoons."
