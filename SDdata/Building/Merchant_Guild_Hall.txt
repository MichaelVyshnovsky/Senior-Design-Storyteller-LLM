The Merchant Guild Hall in the River District of Neverwinter was the guildhall of a merchants guild that operated in the city in the early-to-mid 15 century DR. It was a fort of the Many-Arrows orcs under Vansi Bloodscar in the mid-to-late 15 century DR.
The guildhall was located in Neverwinters old Merchant Square.
The Many-Arrows orcs made rough-and-ready repairs to the ruined guildhall, propping up the collapsing ceilings with wooden beams and patching the holes in the roof with planks and hides. Fortifying it, they girded it with ramshackle wooden towers and stockades, all of wood and hide.

Within, the orcs had contemptuously burned, smashed, or defiled all the existing artworks within and hung their banners and hides, horns and skulls in their place. They repurposed the old meeting halls, dining rooms, and storerooms for their own purposes. It was filled with debris, supplies, and weaponry. Lighting was provided by torches where sunlight didnt shine through holes in the roof.
Originally, the guildhall was an opulent place, adorned with high-quality tapestries and paintings such as "The Prophet". Leaders of the merchant guild came here to negotiate trade and Neverwinters prosperity, as well as to live in luxury.
However, following the Mount Hotenow eruption in 1451 DR, the majority of surviving merchants fled the ruined city and resettled in Waterdeep. Others relocated to the Neverwinters Protectors Enclave after the trade market was re-established there by Lord Dagult Neverember. Their former guildhall remained abandoned and fell into ruin.
Then, when a tribe of orcs from Many-Arrows invaded the River District in the late 1470s DR, they seized the Merchant Guild Hall and made it their fortress.
