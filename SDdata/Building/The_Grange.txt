'''The Grange''' was a trading emporium in [[Elmwood]]. A stone and wood building, it was staffed by its owner, [[Tayroom Onetry]]. He stocked up on everything short of weapons and armor, but could order anything from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] on request, arriving within 10 days or thereabouts.{{cite book/The Moonsea||50-51}}
