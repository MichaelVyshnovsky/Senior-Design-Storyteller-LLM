        "mainbody": "The '''Castle of Illusion''' was a remote keep in the [[Frost Hills]] in the [[Silver Marches]].",
        "Geography": "The castle was located near the eastern side of the [[Fell Pass]] in the [[Frost Hills]], north-east of [[Mithral Hall]].<ref>\nThe castle was among the locations linked through the [[magic]]al transportation network known as the [[Trail of Mists]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}",
        "History": "Centuries before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], when [[Ascalhorn]] was in its prime, the castle was the home of the mighty [[gnome]] [[illusionist]] [[Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim]]. He erected the keep and defended it with illusions, traps, and puzzles.\n\nA century after Fitzmilliyun's death, a tribe of [[orc]]s living nearby overwhelmed the castle and slew his servants before they settled in the ruined castle. They sought treasure, but found none. However, Fitzmilliyun's lethal magical defenses lingered long after his passing, killing a lot of the orcs, maddening many more, and driving them away.\n\nBy [[1358 DR]], the [[evil]] [[wizard]] [[MacBec Maclyon]], a.k.a. Malcyon, and his orc minions had claimed the castle.\n\nHe was still in control by [[1372 DR]], but had begun summoning [[fiend]]s to serve him and defend the Castle of Illusion. The wizard was not aware he was on his way to creating a second [[Hellgate Keep]].",
        "Activities": "By 1372 DR, Malcyon frequently summoned dangerous [[fiend]]s and made deals with dark powers to gain ever-greater [[magic]]al knowledge. He had devils teach him their dark arts.",
        "Defenses": "Fitzmilliyun placed [[illusion]]s and [[glamer]]s, [[ward]]s, traps, and subtle yet deadly puzzles all through the castle, below it, and outside it. These combined mechanical tricks and magical illusions, so even the most perceptive would be deceived. His treasures were all concealed by the puzzles and traps. Some of the grandest puzzles were:\n* Milliyun's Mirror Maze: A hall of mirrors, perhaps with a ''[[mirror of life trapping]]'' and a ''[[mirror of opposition]]'' built in.\n* The Crystal Cube: A cube of seemingly indestructible crystal, {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} to a side, containing valuable treasure and at least three skeletons.\n* Ten Doors, No-Way-Out: A room with ten doors; when a door was opened, the whole room seemed to spin around. Only one door was an exit, while the rest unleashed traps or magical guardians.\n\nMalcyon had [[devil]]s protecting his castle and patrolling the surrounding lands. He had the lower mines sealed off.",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to MacBec Maclyon himself, around 1358 DR, the castle was occupied by his natural minions. There were thirty of them, including a [[magic-user]], a [[fighter]] as his bodyguard, and an orcish [[witch doctor]]."
