Furjurs Flying Carpet was a shop on Northwind street, in the city of Sundabar,  that specialized in a variety of items from the Shining South. It was owned by the famous Waterdhavian merchant Furjur the Flippant though ran in his absence by six young shop-keeps.
Though it was more of a general or specialty goods store, the Flying Carpet was the only place locals of the vale could visit to find miscellaneous, replacement items they might need in a hurry, save for a visit to Silverymoon.
The Flying Carpet was full of items that were far out-of-place in the north such as brass lamps, revealing clothing woven from thin fabric, beaded curtains and even an actual old, dusty flying carpet, which was available for sale at the low cost of 45,000 gp.
