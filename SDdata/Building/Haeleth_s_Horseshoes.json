        "mainbody": "'''Haeleth's Horseshoes''' was a smithy in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], owned and run by [[Haeleth]].",
        "Location": "It stood at the northwestern end of Bargewright Inn, just next door to [[Belvyn]]'s house and facing onto the Mud.<ref><ref>",
        "Interior": "It was a dark and jam-packed place.",
        "Services": "Haeleth's specialty was of course making and attaching [[horseshoe]]s, not only to [[horse]]s but to all kinds of hoofed animals. He also made hasps, hinges, and hooks, which he delivered to [[Waterdeep]] for sale in the markets there. In general, he preferred to work with sturdy [[iron]] than with the finer metals like [[copper]] and [[silver]], but was not inexperienced in them.\n\nThe smithy had been targeted by thieves on occasion, sometimes while he was sound asleep, but none ever came away with more than a fistful of [[copper piece]]s, as Haeleth sent all his earnings to his family in Waterdeep and elsewhere.''Volo's Guide to the North'' p. 30 suggests that these robberies happened while Haeleth was asleep, thus implying that he lives at or near his smithy. However, the map of Bargewright Inn on the preceding page puts his house on the other side of the settlement. Perhaps he naps during the day."
