        "mainbody": "Haeleths Horseshoes was a smithy in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, owned and run by Haeleth.\nIt stood at the northwestern end of Bargewright Inn, just next door to Belvyns house and facing onto the Mud.\nIt was a dark and jam-packed place.\nHaeleths specialty was of course making and attaching horseshoes, not only to horses but to all kinds of hoofed animals. He also made hasps, hinges, and hooks, which he delivered to Waterdeep for sale in the markets there. In general, he preferred to work with sturdy iron than with the finer metals like copper and silver, but was not inexperienced in them.\nThe smithy had been targeted by thieves on occasion, sometimes while he was sound asleep, but none ever came away with more than a fistful of copper pieces, as Haeleth sent all his earnings to his family in Waterdeep and elsewhere.Volos Guide to the North p. 30 suggests that these robberies happened while Haeleth was asleep, thus implying that he lives at or near his smithy. However, the map of Bargewright Inn on the preceding page puts his house on the other side of the settlement. Perhaps he naps during the day."
