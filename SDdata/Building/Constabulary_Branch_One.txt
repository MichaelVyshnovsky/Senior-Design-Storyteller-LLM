'''Constabulary Branch One''' was the first of the three major watch headquarters of the [[Eileanar]] [[enclave]] of [[Netheril]], alongside [[Constabulary Branch Two|Branch Two]] and [[Constabulary Branch Three|Branch Three]].

==Location==
The building was found on the northern rim of the enclave, handling the crimes in that region.

==Structure==
The ground floor of the building was partially publicly accessible, with three receptionists who handled and guided visitors. A large room behind the reception area held the desks, comfy chairs, filing cabinets, and ''[[crystal ball]]s'' of twenty low-ranking constables who worked there when they weren't out patrolling the streets.

The cellar level was made up of an expansive maze of 200 jail cells, with the entire level impossible to magically enter or exit, and causing incredibly dangerous backlash effects against ''[[teleportation]]'' magic.

The upper level of the structure was home to the offices of the highest-ranking constables and commissioners who reported directly to [[Karsus]] and his trusted followers such as [[Andoris Derathar]]. The Chief of Constables [[Zacharia]] was assisted by the loyal and dutiful Underchiefs [[Chanteclaire]], [[Chantonay]], and [[Flamininus]]. Chantonay was responsible for protecting the building via magical and [[quasimagical item]]s, spells, and other magical effects, while Flamininus performed [[divination]]s and similar ''[[augury]]'' magics, using them to locate criminals and verify personal accounts during interviews and court proceedings.

==Defenses==
The jail level of the building was extremely heavily warded against intrusion, thanks to one of Chatonay's friends weaving a complex web of magical defenses. Magical infiltration was impossible, and ''teleportation'' was potentially subject to extreme backlash:

* ''Spell failure'': The spell failed and had no effect, sparing the caster from a worse fate.
* ''Duo dimension'': The caster was subject to ''[[duo-dimension]]'', else be briefly stunned and ''ricocheted''.
* ''Echo'': As the caster bounced off of the wards, a ''[[clone]]'' was generated that was typically sane though with a limited lifespan of several months. If the clone managed to kill the original it would become permanent, otherwise it dissipated once the magic ran out.
* ''Reflection'': The caster was ''teleported'' up to {{SI|1000|mile|k|long=yes}} away from the jails in a random direction.
* ''Refraction'': An extreme effect befell the interloper. This included a crippling magical injury, a forced ''[[reincarnation]]'', a reversal of [[alignment]], a sex change, a permanent weakening of ability, or a permanent boosting of ability while all their magical gear was sucked into the [[Negative Energy plane]].
* ''Ricochet'': The caster was transported to a new location according to the spell used. Intra-planar ''teleportation'' sent them to a random spot on [[Toril]], while spells such as ''[[plane shift]]'' sent them to a random [[plane]] entirely.
