        "Description": "This mosque was built to resemble a pyramid. The entire structure was made from [[copper]] that never tarnished.",
        "Activities": "The Flamesight Mosque was dedicated to [[Hastsezini]], who was also simply called \"Fire.\" Since Hastezini was a hungry god who demanded sacrifice, the [[Noble efreeti|noble efreet]] kept him satiated with rich offerings. Most of the public burnings carried out in the City of Brass were performed at the base of the Flamesight Mosque.",
        "Inhabitants": "The priesthood of Hastezini was small. Similar to the god they venerated, they were vengeful and arrogant."
