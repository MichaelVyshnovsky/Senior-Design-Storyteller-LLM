        "mainbody": "ymeeras was a rooming house in Menzoberranzan that catered to non-drow visitors.\nThe inn was located in Eastmyr\nSymeeras was a largely uninspiring place save for the cheerful Symeera herself. It was known for its excellent accommodations and moderate prices, especially if compared to the treatment that non-drow guests tended to receive at other establishments in Menzoberranzan. Rates were approximately 1 gold piece per person per day, and included not only a room (with a glowglobe light source) but also food and stabling for a mount. Paying guests could also discreetly gain access to almost any kind of magical or mundane equipment they required thanks to Symeeras merchant connections.\nThe rooming house was established sometime after 1350 DR when its proprietor accidentally arrived in Menzoberranzan. Within a couple of decades, it was known as one of the top four best places for surface visitors to stay, and one of the top two for adventurers (the other being Narbondels Shadow)."
