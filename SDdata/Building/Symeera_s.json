        "mainbody": "'''Symeera's''' was a rooming house in [[Menzoberranzan]] that catered to non-[[drow]] visitors.",
        "Location": "The inn was located in [[Eastmyr]]",
        "Services": "Symeera's was a largely uninspiring place save for the cheerful [[Symeera]] herself. It was known for its excellent accommodations and moderate prices, especially if compared to the treatment that non-drow guests tended to receive at other establishments in Menzoberranzan. Rates were approximately 1 [[gold piece]] per person per day, and included not only a room (with a ''[[glowglobe]]'' light source) but also food and stabling for a mount. Paying guests could also discreetly gain access to almost any kind of [[magical]] or mundane equipment they required thanks to Symeera's merchant connections.",
        "History": "The rooming house was established sometime after [[1350 DR]] when its proprietor accidentally arrived in Menzoberranzan. Within a couple of decades, it was known as one of the top four best places for surface visitors to stay, and one of the top two for adventurers (the other being [[Narbondel's Shadow]])."
