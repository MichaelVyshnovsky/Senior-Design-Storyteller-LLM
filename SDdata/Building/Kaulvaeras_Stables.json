        "mainbody": "aulvaeras Stables was a large horse farm located on the western side of Ashabenford, right on the east bank of the River Ashaba, in the late 14 century DR. These renowned stables offered some of the finest horses in the Dalelands, and was run by one their better horse breeders, Kaulvaeras Greymantle. They set very fair prices, considering the quality of their steeds.\nThe Kaulvaeras Stables selection of mounts only included ponies, horses, and sometime warhorses, personally bred and reared by Kaulvaeras himself. Anyone looking to trade in a lame mount would receive a discount on their purchase. Kaulvaeras was far too soft-hearted to put down any tired horses and instead set them out to pasture."
