        "mainbody": "he Watchful Shield was a shrine of Helm located in the Manorborn district of Baldurs Gate. It was established some time before the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. \nThe diminutive chapel had wings extending from either side of its front doorway, and the silver eye of Helm inscribed above.\nThe duties of the temple were handled by the Helmite clergy, members of the Flaming Fist, personal guards and others who sought to protect others from harm.\nClerics of the Watchful Shield long held the tradition of offering free healing services for anyone who says they were injured while defending the meek, regardless of how unbelievable the injured storyteller or how incredulous the tale was.\nFor many years the Watchful Shield was a favored stop for those who felt a duty to protect others, namely soldiers, bodyguards and members of Flaming Fist.\nWhen Helm \"died\" in the Year of Three Streams Blooded, 1384 DR, the temple quickly became empty and devoid of activity. In effect, it became a shrine to the god that died performing their divine duty.\nThere were rumors that an apparition guarded the Watchful Shield at night.\n*Huros of Helm, the priest who offered the temples services in the late 14 century DR."
