        "mainbody": "The Hall of the Voice was a business in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Hall of the Voice was a one-story building in good condition.\nThe Hall of the Voice was known for providing skilled oratory and defense for those who faced the often unforgiving laws of Skullport. In this harsh and swift system of justice, public opinion held significant sway, with decisions frequently resting on the support of influential voices. For a fee, the orators of the Hall of the Voice represented the accused, deploying their rhetorical skill and gathering witnesses to advocate on the clientâ€™s behalf. Charges for these services varied according to the severity of the accusations, with standard fees averaging 50 gold pieces per hour, alongside additional costs for witness appearances.\nAs of 1370 DR, the Hall of the Voice was led by Ametned-thoth, a human from Mulhorand and an accomplished cleric and mage, aligned with Thoth. Known for his unwavering integrity, Amet commanded fees ranging from 20 to 500 gold pieces per hour, adjusting based on the clients financial standing and the nature of the alleged offense. He exercised strict discretion in his case selection, refusing to represent individuals he deemed unworthy of aid. This principled stance has occasionally strained his relations with prominent factions in Skullport, including the Iron Ring and agents of the Eye, who viewed his refusals as a challenge to their influence."
