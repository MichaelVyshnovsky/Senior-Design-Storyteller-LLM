The '''Temple of Talos''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Talos]], the [[god]] of destruction, located in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]], as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of only a few permanent Talassan temples.

==Location==
This temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] to the west, the [[Temple of Beshaba (Bezantur)|Temple of Beshaba]] to the north, the [[Temple of Kossuth (Bezantur)|Temple of Kossuth]] to the east, and the [[Temple of Bane (Bezantur)|Temple of Bane]] to the south.

==Structure==
The building itself was one of the smaller temples in the city, and was little more than a large [[granite]] cube topped with a low white dome.

==Activities==
The temple preached of the destruction that Talos would one day bring about. The congregation was often blamed whenever disasters such as fires occurred around Bezantur.

==History==
As with most of the [[Gods of Fury]], Talos worship was not popular in Thay prior to the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. At some point, followers of Talos forcibly drove the worshipers of another religion from this temple, and then adopted it as their own.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the congregation was led by High Priest [[Nofallis]]. While the people of Bezantur were suspicious of the temple whenever a disaster befell the city, they had yet to accuse or harass the congregation over these allegations as of the late 1360s DR.
