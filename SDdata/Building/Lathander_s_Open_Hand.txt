'''Lathander's Open Hand''' was a shrine dedicated to the Morninglord [[Lathander]], found in the village of [[Hap]] in [[Battledale]]. It remained standing throughout the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Structure==
The Open Hand was in fact once a simple barn built from wood and stone.

==Interior==
A simple chapel with an altar lay in the center of Lathander's shrine. Floating some {{SI|15|ft}} to {{SI|30|ft}} above the alter was the ''[[Blood of Lathander]]'', drop's of the god's blood encased in a chunk of [[amber]] that dated back centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]].

Located in the rear of the shrine were the simple living quarters of its attending priestess. Set atop a disused hay loft was a single bell, that was rung when local townsfolk needed to be alerted.

==Staff==
As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century, the shrine was overseen by [[Mumfrey Mimly]], a rather timid priest of the Morninglord. Mimly was later replaced by the forthright and altruistic Dawnmaster [[Cathalandra Dovaer]].

''Circa'' [[1479 DR]],{{4e-time}} Lathander's Open Hand was overseen by Sister [[Tressa]], one of the few [[Lathanderian]]s that remained in the [[Dalelands|Dales]] for a time following the return of [[Amaunator]] to the Realms.

==Services==
Both Dawnmaster Dovaer and Sister Tressa provided aid to [[good|morally true]] [[adventurer]]s in the form of healing.
