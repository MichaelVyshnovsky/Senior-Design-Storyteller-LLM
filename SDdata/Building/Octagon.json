        "Geography": "The Octagon was found within [[Iskalat]], or the fiery dock ward of the City of Brass.",
        "Activities": "The Octagon could easily hold up to 10,000 prisoners at any given time. Each prisoner was kept locked within their own cubed cell of solid [[basalt]] that sealed magically around them, leaving only a tiny slit for air and to pass food through. Impervious to attacks, these cells could only be opened by the [[efreeti]] prison guards."
