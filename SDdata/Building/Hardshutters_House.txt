The '''Hardshutters House''' was the [[Roofers, Thatchers, and Glaziers Guild]]'s guildhall in the city of [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
The Hardshutters House stood on the northern end of Suzail's open-air [[The Market (Suzail)|Market]], facing south, where [[Garth Street]] reached the Market plaza.

==Interior==
Early in his career, [[Ullvor Mharivven]] commissioned a custom spell that animated glass shards collected in Hardshutters House's attic. With a single opening of the guildhall's attic, its master could release a whirlwind of sharp glass onto thieves and unwanted guests. The shard storm was similar to the effects of the ''[[blade barrier]]'' [[spell]].

==Services==
The Hardshutters House offered membership to roofers, slate-masons, shingle-cutters, thatchers, thatch-cutters, glaziers, "[[sandglass]]" makers, and glass stainers.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Ullvor Mharivven was in change of the guildhall.
