        "Activities": "While the faith of Mask was popular in Proskur, Patriarch [[Milo Hallyspear]] taught an alternative doctrine to that of others: lying and thievery was perfectly acceptable as long as the thief benefited from the experience.  \n\nHallyspear and his seven assistants preached this unorthodox teaching, which caused no little controversy with the wider church."
