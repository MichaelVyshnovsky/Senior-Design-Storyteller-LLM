The temple of Kelemvor was a holy house dedicated to the Lord of the Dead that was open in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate during the late 15 century DR. It was run by Father Alby, who was assisted by the cleric Nerys.
The church was a simple stone building with a number of steeples. Its facade featured the holy symbol of Kelemvor, a skeletal arm holding balanced scales.
The temple and its staff safeguarded a number of relics considered holy to the church of Kelemvor.
The temple staff assisted with the burials for Baldurian citizens, including soldiers and guards of the Flaming Fist.
Father Alby offered coins of Kelemvor as a means of compensation. These tokens bestowed upon the owner a considerate and respectful funerary service for a single deceased individual.
At some point during the 1480s, three individuals, Dron, Utna and Sangin, were skulking around the temple, forcing Father Alby and Nerys to keep a steadfast vigil. In order to have a reprieve, Alby hired the Heroes of Baldurs Gate to investigate the issue.
The following night, Dron and Utna assaulted the church in their werewolf forms, accompanied by a nearly a dozen skeletons. Nerys was abducted during the battle, along with the brave hamster Boo.
