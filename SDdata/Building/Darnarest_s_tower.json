        "mainbody": "arnarests tower was a ruined structure that once belonged to a moderately famous wizard Darnarest the Bladesmith. The tower itself was erected on the foundation of a much older tower of a wizard affiliated with the city of Myth Drannor.\nThe surface level of the tower was notable for many scattered stones that were a part fo the tower at one point with the foundation of sturdy laid stone. Many of the stones were noticeably partially melted. From the remnants of the tower, one could see that the tower was of a square shape with 40 ft. sides, and small 10 ft. wide square rooms in the corners. Almost in the center of the ruined structure was stone stairs leading into the first sub-level.\nIn 1369 DR, the first sublevel was used as barracks for the Cult of the Dragon members. The Cult installed a black curtain on the bottom of the stairs that blocked the outside light from getting inside. The rooms were illuminated with two iron bars enchanted with the continual flame spell. On the eastern side of the sub-level was a door that led to a room that was used by one of the Cults leaders - Bishimzon and his familiar viper Shurrs.\nThe second sub-level was used by the Cult as a makeshift prison. The southern wall had manacles attached to it and the room itself was lit with iron rods of continual flame. On the northern wall of the prison was a hidden door to a room molded out of stone using magic by Darnarest himself. The stone of the door has a barely detectable mismatch compared to the rest of the wall.\nFurther west, the open area of the sub-level was once Darnarests research room where Handragath and his familiar viper Rexin guarded the alcove with the gate to Myth Drannor.\nDarnarests tower was built on the foundation of a much older destroyed tower that belonged to an unknown wizard circa 403 DR. That long-forgotten wizard had a connection to the city of Myth Drannor and created a one-way gate to the Shrine of Mystra there. Darnarest himself did not know how to activate the said gate.\nIn the , an adult red dragon named Kezzanamark came searching for Darnarest with a petty vengeance. After Darnarest was bitten in half, Kezzanamark melted the wizards tower and scattered its remnants in search of treasure.\nIn 1369 DR, members of the Cult of the Dragon were using the towers sub-levels as a hideout and captured slaves, transporting them via the gate for the Cults activities in Myth Drannor. The Cult spent around two tendays in the ruins of Darnarests tower until their operations have been disturbed by a group of adventurers searching for some missing townsfolk."
