The House of Silks was a fine clothing and jewelry shop located in Westgate in 1367 DR.
The shop was located at the corner of Westgate Market Street and Woodside Way in the south section of the city in front of Castle Thorsar.
The House of Silks prices were expensive but their clothing and jewelry were of the highest quality. An extraordinary number of their customers seemed to have their purchases stolen, leading many to wonder if the proprietors of the business were up to no good. The owners insisted that the Night Masks were simply targeting them and trying to ruin their business.
