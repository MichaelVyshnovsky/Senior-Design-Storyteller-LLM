The '''Hold of Battle Lions''', or '''Hold of ''the'' Battle Lions''', was a shrine to [[Tempus]] built within in [[Dragonspear Castle]]. It remained a bastion against the [[fiend]]s of the [[Nine Hells]] for over 150 years, despite the repeated leveling of its structure.

==Location==
The stone temple was located within the castle's inner ward, a short distance beyond the front doors of the main keep.<ref group="note">[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]] states the temple was located within the castle's cellars.

==Interior==
;Altar of Tempus:
Both in the years while it was intact and the century or so afterwards, the Hold of Battle Lions safeguarded the altar dedicated to Tempus. This stained marble altar was the focal point for [[ritual]]s that revitalized and strengthened the [[ward]]s sealing the ''[[portal]]'' that lay beneath Dragonspear Castle.

Set within the marble was the source of its tremendous power,

==Activities==
The temple served as a bulwark to the [[fiend]]s that could readily escape from the [[Nine Hells]] through the portal beneath Dragonspear Castle. The champions of the temple carried out their duty for nearly half a century, before being overwhelmed. 

==Defenses==
While it was intact and occupied, the temple was considered to be well-manned and fortified.

==History==
The Hold of Battle Lions was built in the {{YearlinkName|1315}}, after the combined forces of  [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Waterdeep]] eradicated the malevolent forces that lived within the castle. 

In the {{YearlinkName|1354}}, just after the [[First Dragonspear War]], the castle was overrun by [[devil]]s once more. They were rebuffed and cleared out some [[1363 DR|seven years later]], and the temple was rebuilt as a shrine by Tempus' [[priest]]s.<ref group="note">The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|FRCS 3e]] states that priests of [[Tempus]] erected  shrine "a decade ago" from [[1372 DR]]. Presumably they are referring to a rebuilt Hold of Battle Lions, rather than its original construction some 50 years prior or some secondary shrine of Tempus.

For many years the shrine was regularly assaulted by various beastly and malicious creatures, such as [[bugbear]]s, [[orc]]s, [[drow]], and [[fiend]]s, but remained intact for some time.

As of the 15{{th}} century DR, the castle came under the protection of a group of mercenaries. Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the mercenaries were bested and the temple was once again destroyed, this by [[undead]] forces under the leadership of the creature known as [[Born]].

Some years later, [[Alwern Mulverax]] and [[Darrondar Gweth]] visited the ruined shrine in order to cast the necessary rituals that would strengthen the wards sealing Dragonspear's portal. Alwern betrayed his friend and left him to be ''[[Dominate person|dominated]]'' by the [[Szarlnaxi]] [[vampire]]s that had taken nearby residence.

Around that same time, the [[rakshasa]] [[Nadir]] sought out the temple to break the portal's seals. He believed this could be accomplished by defiling the altar with the blood of a devout follower of Tempus, namely Darrondar.
