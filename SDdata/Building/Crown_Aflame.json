        "mainbody": "The '''Crown Aflame''', known by some as '''the Red Fruit''', was a lush theater on [[Sarlannus Street]] in the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] of [[Athkatla]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The building of the theater was a former temple of [[Azuth]], as evidenced by the magnificent pillars at its entrance.\n\nThe inner walls of the Crown were plush and draped in red velvet. Jutting out from its reaches were a series of inward-facing, rounded balconies. The seats were steeply arranged around a grand, ovular stage that was fantastic for carrying the voices of performers, especially while singing.",

            "Grand Plays": "* ''[[And So They Met the Gargoyle]]'': The classic by [[Zarghar]].\n*''[[Gilded Unicorn]]'': Written by the young playwright [[Raulivan Torthtra]] of [[Zazesspur]].\n*''[[The Shattered Throne Tumbles]]'': A play written by the blind [[Ilmatari]] [[monk]] [[Annadas Athlo]].",

            "Traveling Favorites": "*[[Shadazzryl Chalraeva]]: She was among the most beloved actresses in Athkatla from among the troupes that regularly traveled to the city."
        },
        "The Talking Painting": "Although the theater's main draw was the plays and shows that were put on the stage, it had another attraction for visitors in between performances. Under the careful watch of Athkatlan guards, patrons could pay a few [[gold piece]]s for a tour of the ''[[Talking Painting]]'', a massive many-paneled painting on the Crown's walls. It portrayed a life-size scene of many guild masters and burghers of Athkatla that was [[magic]]ally enchanted to have them speak a variety of seemingly random phrases. Their meaning was unknown, though it was speculated that they amounted to an elaborate practical joke or scavenger hunt for some long-lost treasures and [[artifact]]s."
