The Uppers Towers was the formal name given to a pair of parallel, major torchtowers &mdash civic owned guard towers that stood along the city of Waterdeeps Trollwall.Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of "torchtower."The sourcebook City System states that all torchtowers with names are "major towers".
These towers stood in the North Ward, in the center of its border with the Sea Ward. They stood on either side of the High Road, where it carried on into the Field Ward.
The Upper Towers both stood four stories tall. They were each connected to the Trollwall that bounded the city and separated the North and Sea Wards from the Field Ward. They acted as one of the gates between these wards.
Being torchtowers, the Upper Towers both had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being major torchtowers, the Upper Towers both had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.
Like all other torchtowers, these towers both had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.
The Upper Towers were manned by members of the City Watch.
