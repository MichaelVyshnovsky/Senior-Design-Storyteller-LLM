        "mainbody": "rimson Draughts was an alchemists shop located on Stormshore Street in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate across from Beehive Goods and Wares general store in the late 15 century DR. It was run by Araj Oblodra.\nCrimson Draughts was a single-storied but spacious building with its main floor reserved for the business and alchemical experiments done in the basement. Both shops, Draughts and Beehive Goods, were somewhere roughly southeast of The Blushing Mermaid in the Lower City.\nSome of the goods offered at the Draughts were unreliable at best. One of Arajs customers penned an angry letter to the shop, claiming that after imbibing one of her sanguineous potions, their limbs began moving on their own accord and their blood boiled like oil. Lastly, they were unable to sleep for a tenday thanks to the voices in their head.\nCrimson Draughts carried some magic items and potions, as well as volatile substances smokepowder bombs, a hat of storm scions power, a thunderskin cloak, a robe of exquisite focus, rings of free action, a risky ring, a pair of boots of arcane bolstering, and a circlet of hunting. Among the shops more notable concoctions was sanguine explosive, a potion of everlasting vigor, as well as various sanguineous distillates of humanoid blood that temporarily shared various races properties with the imbibers.\nBy the , Crimson Draughts was run by an eccentric and ambitious drow Araj Oblodra, an alchemist and trader in blood and the sanguinous arts. She was known to do business with the dread Cult of the Absolute and operated the shop in Baldurs Gate with some success. By the time the Absolute crisis began to shake the Gate, Crimson Draughts had had several months worth of customer complaints, prompting an investigation by the Flaming Fists. An official investigation was opened in accordance with the Public Health Act and the Civilian Protection Order, and a notification was mailed to the shop. Araj Oblodra was ordered not to interfere with the investigation and not to leave the city or she would be held in contempt of the Council of Four.\nAraj Oblodra might have had an opportunity to use her shops laboratory to develop special and deadly types of potions using the blood of the Absolute Adversaries, if the heroes were inclined to share their life-giving substance. If her research was successful, Araj couldve left the Gate for her Houses home in Menzoberranzan to bring House Oblodra into good graces with the new sanguineous magics. The fate of Crimson Draughts remains unknown."
