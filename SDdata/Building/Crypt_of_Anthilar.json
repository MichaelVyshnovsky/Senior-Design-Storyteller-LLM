        "mainbody": "he Crypt of Anthilar was the legendary secret lair of the lich Anthilar, known as the Archmage of Untisczer.\nIt was hidden in the mountains west of the Tashan Gap in the Tashalar.\nIn the Year of Wasteful Pride, 285 DR, after the Shoon Imperium destroyed Untisczer, Anthilar escaped to his secret lair in the neighboring Tashalar. It was here that Anthilar transformed himself into an undead lich and plotted to covertly control the merchants of Tashluta, until his capture there in the Year of the Laughing Dead, 1056 DR.\nBy the 14 century DR, many adventurers had searched for the Crypt of Anthilar, but few, or none, were ever seen again.\nThe lichs lair was reputed to hold the spellskins of Mhairshaulk, which the adventurers hoped to recover.\nIt was supposed by some that Anthilar, though trapped, could manifest as a ghost from faraway and that he regularly returned to his lair to see that no-one trespassed there."
