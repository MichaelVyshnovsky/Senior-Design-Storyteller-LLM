        "mainbody": "roadhands Forge and Tack was a weapons and armor shop located to the south west of Silverymoon. It secretly housed an altar room in dedication to Bane.\nThe shop was owned by the blacksmith Broadhand, and sold a large variety of items. It had a horseshoe-shaped sign, made of wood, right above the door.\nThe shop actually had a secret door at the back that led to several more rooms, which were used in worship to the Black Lord.\nCirca 1358 DR, the future Heroes of Ascore came to the shop to inquire about the festival going on in Mielikkis Glade. The party convinced the owner, Broadhand, that they had been sent from Nesm√© on behalf of the Banite cause. They were led through a secret door to the back section of the shop, and came before a shrine to the Black Lord. The room was decorated with statues and images of Bane, and it was here that Broadhand told them of the Zhentarim plan to seize territory across the northern realms."
