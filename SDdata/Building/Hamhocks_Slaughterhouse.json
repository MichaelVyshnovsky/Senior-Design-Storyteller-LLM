        "mainbody": "The '''Hamhocks Slaughterhouse''' was a massive compound composed of a number of animal pens, knackeries and butcheries in the [[Baldur's Gate/Sow's Foot|Sow's Foot]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]].<ref group=\"note\">The ''[[Murder in Baldur's Gate]]'' Dungeon Master's screen shows the slaughterhouse as being in the middle of the [[Sow's Foot]] district, but the more recent ''[[Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus]]'' explicitly states it is in [[Stonyeyes]].\n\nThe establishment had a mixed relationship with the surrounding neighborhood. While their location was convenient to local butchers, the odor drove away the animals of the herders and wranglers.",
        "Description": "As expected, Hamhocks was covered in the stench of animal blood.",
        "History": "Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the owner of Hamhocks Slaughterhouse was killed by members of the [[Cult of the Dead Three]] and supplanted by their leader, [[Pasque Enrial]]. The group began to use the slaughterhouse as their headquarters, while committing horrific murders around the city."
