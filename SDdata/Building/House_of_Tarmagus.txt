The '''House of Tarmagus''' was a warehouse located in [[Waterdeep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The House of Tarmagus was a storehouse that allowed third-parties to rent storage space for a reasonable fee and with confidence that their goods would be kept well-guarded and protected from the elements. It only permitted "dry, non-living, and never-living items".{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20221122003652/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1365795837264158720| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 31-5-2023| date = 27-2-2021}}

The business boasted the claim of being one of the only such facilities in Waterdeep not affiliated with or under the control of a syndicate like the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] (and continued support from [[Masked Lord]]s, [[Open Lord]]s, and the [[Blackstaff]] kept it this way over the decades). 

==Structure==
The building stood four stories tall. The [[Keelhauled Dwarf]] tavern was located beneath the cellar of the House of Tarmagus. Constantly running pumps in a corner of the House kept the tavern dry.

==Location==
The House of Tarmagus was located in the southeast section of the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] in a neighborhood bordered by [[Keel Alley]] to the southwest, [[Net Street (south)|Net Street]] to the southeast, and [[Pressbow Lane]] to the northeast.{{Cite interactive atlas|Dock South Ward}}

==History==
The House of Tarmagus was founded by [[Eaerdran Tarmagus]] in the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, a businessman who perceived that no existing warehouses in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] were "doing things right" by not cracking down on things like water damage and theft. Despite numerous attempts by rivals to shut him down—including arson, raids, and a group of [[duergar]] and [[half-orc]]s who threatened him in his bedchamber—the business made him very wealthy. He ultimately bequeathed his businesses to a number of retired [[adventurer]]s who had become his partners (both in commerce and romance), and they and their descendants continued to run the House through the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
