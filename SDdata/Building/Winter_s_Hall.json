        "mainbody": "'''Winter's Hall''' was the palace{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|59-61}} and realm of [[Auril]] Goddess of Winter.",
        "Cosmology": "[[File:Yggdrasil Illustration.png|thumb|273px|''An artistic rendition of Yggdrasil, featuring Winter's Hall beneath.'']]\nIn the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], Winter's Hall was found on the layer of [[Pandesmos]] A branch of [[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash, extended to the realm and was said to form the central supporting beam of the hall.\n\nIn the [[World Tree cosmology]], her palace was located in [[Fury's Heart]], across from the [[Towers of Ruin]] over the [[Land of the Hunt]].\n\nBetween the aftermath of the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], as part of the [[World Axis cosmology]], Auril's palace was said to hover over the [[Deep Wild]]s, bringing winter with it. The northernmost reaches of the Wilds were known as TÃ­r fo Leth, the Frostfell, or the [[Land Under Eternal Ice]]&mdash;to distinguish them from the palace itself&mdash;and this region was fully under Auril's control.",
        "Geography": "The realm of Winter's Hall was a frigid tundra fraught with violent winter storms, with winds rarely slower than 30 miles per hour. Visibility was only a few feet, because of the extreme blizzard conditions. As one traveled deeper into the realm, it grew colder and colder until the land was covered in a vast sheet of ice. It was said that there was no colder place in the multiverse, and anyone not taking shelter would take extreme damage from the bitter cold.\n\nAuril's palace itself was formed from ''[[wind wall]]s'' and ice. It appeared like an inverted iceberg, hovering over the ground and surrounded in thick fog and freezing rain. Almost a mile in both diameter and height, it was the size of a small city. Huge crystalline extensions jutted out from the core of the fortress palace and were colored royal blue to sea green.\n\nThe bottom surface of the floating palace included a giant window of shaped wind to view the ground below. Also located here was a dock for flying vessels, such as [[astraljammer]]s and [[airship]]s.\n\nThe interior of the palace was a labyrinth of passageways. The Araamroth, or Promenade, was one of these, and it cut through the whole height of Winter's Hall, a latticework of pathways of crystal and support columns. The Promenade was lit by [[will-o'-wisp]] and other glowing creatures entrapped in ice globes. At the top of the Promenade was a dome of pure elemental ice. Auril could calm the winter storms surrounding the palace if she wanted the polar lights to be visible through the dome. At the base of the Promenade was a twin oscillating structure of chaos called the Abattoir, where bloody sacrifices were once performed in an attempt to trap [[Toril]] forever in darkness and ice.\n\nDeep within Winter's Hall was the Lyceum of Frozen Shadow, or Amon Thyryr, Aurils's throne room. Auril's throne itself was carved from frozen blue fire. The throne room was carved from the beating heart of the [[primordial]] [[Durbaagal]].",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Petitioner]]s of Auril took on the forms of cold elemental spirits, which were immune to [[cold]] and [[electricity]] and resistant to [[fire]] and [[sonic]] damage. These beings could inflict cold on anyone they touched. Nearly 20,000 such damned spirits resided within the palace walls alone.\n\nOther creatures of ice, such as cold element creatures and [[ice para-elemental]]s, also dwelt throughout the realm, as did [[frost giant]]s and an assortment of [[Wolf|wolves]], including [[Winter wolf|winter wolves]], normal wolves, [[worg]]s, and even [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. All canine monsters that entered the hall became ''charmed'' to obey its frost giant inhabitants and became servants of the frost giantess [[Ingrid the Serpent-Tongue]]. The pack of canines was led by [[White Fang]], an albino [[yeth hound]].\n\nThe [[Norse pantheon|Norse]] god [[Loki]] was said to sometimes make Winter's Hall his abode, as a place to hide away whenever he fell out of grace with the other [[Norse pantheon|Aesir]]. While there, he often held feasts for the frost giants in his wooden hall of rough timber.\n\nWhenever he was away a [[cloud giant]] jarl by the name of [[Starkad the Gnawer]] would claim to be his proxy. Though many considered Ingrid to be the real power in the hall, as she led most of the Hall's hunts.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Winter's Hall was rumored to be the true source of the [[Styx]]. According to the legend, a mix of melting snow, divine [[poison]] and the blood of a tortured [[deity]] flowed into Pandemonium and became infused with the plane's [[evil]].{{Cite dragon/358/Savage Tidings: The River Styx|65}}"
