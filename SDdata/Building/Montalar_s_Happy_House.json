        "mainbody": "century DR.\nMontalars Happy House was a popular eatery open dawn-to-dusk that stood on the Swordstars Lane in Suzail and served the areas warehouse workers.\nMontalars Happy House was separated by a cart alley from Jharkos Coffers and Crates—its neighbor to the west. The cart alley connected the Swordstars Lane to the warehouses at the center of the block. The decaying manor of Talarkgates stood behind Montalars.\nThe eatery was on the first floor of a three-story building. Bhaerusk and his family lived on the second floor above the Happy House and rented out apartments on the third floor. The building also had a spacious cellar. The first floor and the cellar both had back entrances, usually cluttered with food crates and covered in runner-vines grown by the proprietors annually. The roof of the building was decorated with laundry lines.\nThe dining hall was open at the first rays of dawn and closed its shutters at dusk every day. Montalars Happy House sent all clients to search drunken debauchery and entertainment elsewhere.\nDuring work hours, the eatery served cider during all times of the year–ice-cold in the sweltering summer months and hot when it was chilly outside. Among alcoholic drinks, they offered weak ale, and local favorite sweet berry wine, also low in alcohol content. Another specialty of the Happy House were happy helms–a type of handfood pastry. These handfoods were often sold out of a quick service window on the side of the eatery. The window always attracted a long line of hungry customers offering a good price, just a copper for two happy helms.\nThe restaurant was run by Bhaerusk Montalar in the late 14 century DR. His four daughters, wife, and wifes two sisters were the Happy Houses staff.\n* As of the late 14 century DR, local gossip talked about the reason for the happy helms strong-tasting sauce was that it makes people buy more drinks and that it hid the taste of chopped rat.\n* Yet another rumor claimed that Bhaerusk rented the restaurants cellar to anyone who was willing to pay for the digression, no questions asked."
