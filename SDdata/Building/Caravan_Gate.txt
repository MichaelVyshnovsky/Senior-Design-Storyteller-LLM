The Caravan Gate was located in western Daggerford at the intersection of [[Duke's Way]] and [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]].

The gate was only accessible after crossing a moat and bridge. The road leading through the gate passed beneath a section of Daggerford's outer wall that was guarded by a pair of large towers.
