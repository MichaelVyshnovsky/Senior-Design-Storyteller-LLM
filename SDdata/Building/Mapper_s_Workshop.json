        "mainbody": "The Mappers Workshop was a small shop in the city of Ravens Bluff, operated by the mage Jork Marpe in the 14 century DR, that sold maps and various other kinds of paper products.\nThis shop was originally tucked away within an alley, near the riverfront in the district of Crows End.\nAt both of its locations the shop was housed within a ramshackled wooden building. A faded, scrawled sign hung above their doors that read \"Pictures Drawn.\"\nThe original storefront consisted of an office room that customers were never allowed beyond, two storage rooms that were well organized, a library, and three bedrooms. The front door had a broken lock, which led the store to never have valuable merchandise out on display.\nThe office room in the original storefront was filled with all manner of tables for drafting and scribing. His desk was well-cared for and made of polished walnut, but typically found covered in papers and quills, with drawers jammed full of parchment scrolls and various mugs. The Workshops tables all had magic on them that made papers adhered to them so they wouldnt move while the mage worked. They could only be removed by applying an exotic ink with an intricate stamp bearing Jorks mage sigil.\nThis Mappers Workshop was a rather obscure business in Ravens Bluff. It was largely unknown to the citys officials, as well as the Merchants Guild, Most of its business was generated by word of mouth. The majority of its clientele were adventurers, though far-traveled merchants were also known to visit it.\nJork Morpes distaste for young adventurers, his ever inquisitive insistence that customers inform him of their reasons for wanting to purchase any of his merchandise, and the ill-temper that was expressed whenever the hard-of-hearing mage was misunderstood, were found to be quite irritating to some. The cantankerous mage attempted to be cordial with customers, but often fell flat. Later on he began asking customers to write down their requests for him, understanding that shouting to get through to him could be tiresome, Despite these issues, the Mappers Workshop managed to maintain regular customers who were accustomed to Jorks quick-temper and hearing issues. Having a keen memory, clients were always remembered by the mage.\nBeing the namesake of the Mappers Workshop, the shop sold a wide selection of geographical maps of places all across Faer√ªn, as well as comprehensive maps of the sewers of Ravens Bluff and fragments of those maps. The store also stocked a few maps of various countries that existed on the world of Oerth, particularly those that neighbored the city-state of Greyhawk, having been gifted them by a well-traveled merchant that spoke highly of Oerth. Most of the maps sold at the shop were supplied by Jorks two adventuring sons, though Jork did make a few of them himself and would spend painstaking hours to create copies of his most popular maps. Jork also occasionally hired adventurers to explore the under-detailed areas of his maps.\nBesides maps, the Workshop sold diagrams of gnomish inventions, sketches of ruined keeps, detailed drawing of suits of armor, and schematics of the homes of Ravenian nobles (acquired from thieves).\nMaps were priced according to each customers age, appearance, and the urgency of their need for it. Those under the age of 50 were comparatively charged more than those who werent. If clients lacked enough gold pieces for a purchase the proprietor was willing to negotiate a bargain for valuable items, jewelry, and weapons. And if a map couldnt be afforded, he was willing to offer a glimpse for a price,\nSometime in the 14 century DR, the necromancer Artemus visited the Mappers Workshop and inquired about purchasing the stores map of the citys sewers. Jork informed the necromancer that he would have to wait and come back a few days after he had made a copy of it. Unwilling to wait, Artemus broke into the Workshop later and stole it. A few days later a group of adventurers came into the shop seeking the same map, but Jork had only a partial copy to offer them at a cost of 80 gold pieces. He was willing to tell the adventurers all the details he could remember about Artemus, though only if they paid him a bribe of 30 or 60 gp."
