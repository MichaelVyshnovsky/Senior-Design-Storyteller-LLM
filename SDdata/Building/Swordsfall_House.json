        "mainbody": "'''Swordsfall House''' was a [[shraehouse]] (a small restaurant/tavern) in the city of [[Silverymoon]] in the [[Silver Marches]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/My Slice of Silverymoon/Part 2}}\n{{quote|The best houses run to real mouth-watering menus, but Hollowhar has only one such bright spot: Swordsfall House.|Chesmyr Morrowynd}}",
        "Location": "The building stood on [[Nutting Lane]] in the [[Silverymoon/Hollowhar|Hollowhar]] area of Silverymoon’s [[Silverymoon/Northbank|Northbank]]. Being on the eastern side of the street, it lay opposite the entrance to [[Druinwood Way]]. It was known to be the grandest shraehouse in Hollowhar and the only one with a full menu.",
        "Structure": "A two story-building, not including the cellar, Swordsfall House had an elegant frontage with paneled wooden outer walls between the stone columns that stood at the corners and periodically along the side walls. These columns were carved to appear as elven maidens with smiling faces and shapely figures draped in sheer attire; visitors remarked that must get cold in winter. These columns supported a wide awning that was covered in mosses and sheltered folk beneath from weather. Protruding from the walls above were tiered stone planter bowls that were used to grow [[herb]]s and flowering vines.\n\nTo enter, one went through an arch at street level and up a wide but short stairway with well-worn treads. At the top was a sturdy wooden door with a handle crafted from two broken [[sword]]s, with an ornate hilts at the top and bottom and their broken blades blunted and welded into a single broad, flat bar emerging from the door. The door was said to be [[enchanted]] somehow.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The establishment was crowded with patrons and noisy with chatter and work at all times of the day and night. Although the shraehouse was neither spacious nor opulent like proper restaurants in other parts of Silverymoon, people came from across the city for the good cheap food and company, no matter how far they might need to walk. Many would have their meals here and then go for drinks and continued conversation at another, more ordinary shraehouse, whether one of the two others in Hollowhar or one on the way back to their homes. Oftentimes, people couldn't get into Swordsfall at all went to some other, more humble shraehouse like [[Ammarlath's Boot]].\n\nIt was a common meeting place for people doing business. For example, [[Chesmyr Morrowynd]], a maker of [[harp]] strings, often met the harpmasters he sold to here at Swordsfall, like [[Altymo Phaernphar]], [[Arilyn Dathlue]], and [[Markovel Stonestorm]]."

        "Services": "Swordsfall House was open all day and all night, selling food and drink and lots of it. Prices ranged from 2 [[silver piece]]s per platter for 'low meals' to 6 sp for 'high meals', while drinks were sold for 2 [[copper piece]]s to 6 [[gold piece]]s per tankard, according to the quality. Drinks could be [[beer]], [[wine]], or stronger spirits.\n\nFor low meals, there were all kinds of hot broths and soups, including the house special, [[venison]]-and-[[mushroom]] broth. These were favored in the winter and were served in a bowl on a platter with garnishes. As well, there were duck livers, [[thaevor potatoes]], mushrooms in cream, spicy lamb sausages, [[pear]]s marinated in wine, and [[tammar]] from [[Calimshan]].\n\nHigh meals varied, but one could usually have platters of wood [[turtle]],  plucked roast [[dove]], and firespiced (seared) [[rothé]] steaks, and sometimes [[boar]] with sliced [[apple]]s; [[rabbit]] in [[zzar]]; [[duck]] with berry stuffing; roast duck with [[chestnut]]s; a whole [[quail]] on a skewer cooked in [[butter]]; poultry diced and fried in [[garlic]], [[nut]]s, and [[ginger]]; or river [[clam]]s steamed in a rich fish stock with [[onion]], [[sarsae]], and [[herb]]s. Included in the price was a side dish of thin slices of [[cheese]] and fruit and a small drink of a cordial like fruit [[brandy]] or zzar, to \"clear the throat\" after the meal.\n\nFinally, garnishes on offer were roasted [[almond]]s, [[honey]]ed [[fig]]s, pickled [[lemon]]s and [[quince]], biscuits spread with garlic or nut butter, and various tarts, both fruit tarts and savories filled with cooked minced dove or coney rabbit with a berry or lime sauce.",
        "Staff": "Master [[Jarvalar Buckman]] ran Swordsfall House and employed four women, [[Alyth]], [[Cathla]], [[Ilmaeri]], and [[Ninrae]], who cooked and served food.",
