        "mainbody": "wordsfall House was a shraehouse (a small restaurant/tavern) in the city of Silverymoon in the Silver Marches in the late 14 century DR.\nThe building stood on Nutting Lane in the Hollowhar area of Silverymoon’s Northbank. Being on the eastern side of the street, it lay opposite the entrance to Druinwood Way. It was known to be the grandest shraehouse in Hollowhar and the only one with a full menu.\nA two story-building, not including the cellar, Swordsfall House had an elegant frontage with paneled wooden outer walls between the stone columns that stood at the corners and periodically along the side walls. These columns were carved to appear as elven maidens with smiling faces and shapely figures draped in sheer attire visitors remarked that must get cold in winter. These columns supported a wide awning that was covered in mosses and sheltered folk beneath from weather. Protruding from the walls above were tiered stone planter bowls that were used to grow herbs and flowering vines.\nTo enter, one went through an arch at street level and up a wide but short stairway with well-worn treads. At the top was a sturdy wooden door with a handle crafted from two broken swords, with an ornate hilts at the top and bottom and their broken blades blunted and welded into a single broad, flat bar emerging from the door. The door was said to be enchanted somehow.\nAs with most shraehouses, Swordsfall had a central bar protruding from the wall of the keg room and ledges lining the walls for patrons to park their drinks. But while typical shraehouses were small, cramped places with standing-room-only for drinkers on their flagstone floors, Swordsfall House had twice the floor space and four long tables with attached benches for common dining. The place was austere and the lightning dim, even dark.\nThe buildings cellars had in the distant past been remodeled and enclosed to create a lower story. It included kitchens, pantries, and privies. Notably, these were separate jack and maid privies with large sinks and piped water, making them rather extravagant.\nLiving quarters for staff and others were found on the upper story.\nThe establishment was crowded with patrons and noisy with chatter and work at all times of the day and night. Although the shraehouse was neither spacious nor opulent like proper restaurants in other parts of Silverymoon, people came from across the city for the good cheap food and company, no matter how far they might need to walk. Many would have their meals here and then go for drinks and continued conversation at another, more ordinary shraehouse, whether one of the two others in Hollowhar or one on the way back to their homes. Oftentimes, people couldnt get into Swordsfall at all went to some other, more humble shraehouse like Ammarlaths Boot.\nIt was a common meeting place for people doing business. For example, Chesmyr Morrowynd, a maker of harp strings, often met the harpmasters he sold to here at Swordsfall, like Altymo Phaernphar, Arilyn Dathlue, and Markovel Stonestorm.\nSwordsfall House was open all day and all night, selling food and drink and lots of it. Prices ranged from 2 silver pieces per platter for low meals to 6 sp for high meals, while drinks were sold for 2 copper pieces to 6 gold pieces per tankard, according to the quality. Drinks could be beer, wine, or stronger spirits.\nFor low meals, there were all kinds of hot broths and soups, including the house special, venison-and-mushroom broth. These were favored in the winter and were served in a bowl on a platter with garnishes. As well, there were duck livers, thaevor potatoes, mushrooms in cream, spicy lamb sausages, pears marinated in wine, and tammar from Calimshan.\nHigh meals varied, but one could usually have platters of wood turtle,  plucked roast dove, and firespiced (seared) rothé steaks, and sometimes boar with sliced apples rabbit in zzar duck with berry stuffing roast duck with chestnuts a whole quail on a skewer cooked in butter poultry diced and fried in garlic, nuts, and ginger or river clams steamed in a rich fish stock with onion, sarsae, and herbs. Included in the price was a side dish of thin slices of cheese and fruit and a small drink of a cordial like fruit brandy or zzar, to \"clear the throat\" after the meal.\nFinally, garnishes on offer were roasted almonds, honeyed figs, pickled lemons and quince, biscuits spread with garlic or nut butter, and various tarts, both fruit tarts and savories filled with cooked minced dove or coney rabbit with a berry or lime sauce.\nMaster Jarvalar Buckman ran Swordsfall House and employed four women, Alyth, Cathla, Ilmaeri, and Ninrae, who cooked and served food.\nChesmyr Morrowynd described Swordsfall House and other matters of everyday Silvaeren life to Ed Greenwood,"
