Approaching it through the Forest required traversing a narrow and treacherous ravine, and the castle itself was cloaked by trees and weeds, making the task of finding the castle a quest in itself, let alone conquering the horrors to be found within.",
        "Structure": "The castle was built of [[human]] skulls, which had been placed in neat rows as if they were bricks or stones. These skulls gave the castle's walls, turrets, and parapets a whitish gray color and an uneven texture. The main entrance was a looming foot placed in the center of the rectangular structure, and was framed by three massive thigh bones that were over {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} long.",

        "History": "The castle was built in the {{YearlinkName|289}}, to celebrate an epic battle against the [[Northmen]] in which the [[Ffolk]] were victorious. The fortress was raised by High King [[Gwylloch]] and his son, Prince Ketheryll, using the skulls of all the enemies of the Ffolk who had fallen in battle. Gwylloch was so impressed with the morbid pile that he made it his permanent residence and moved his court there from [[Caer Callidyrr]]. The castle was also the headquarters of Prince Ketheryll's so-called [[Doomed Legion]], who reveled in watching innocents be put to death in the Citcus Bizarre.\n\nHigh King Gwylloch continued to augment the citadel with the severed heads of all who opposed him&mdash;Northmen and Ffolk alike&mdash;and launched military expeditions to gather heads and captives. Eventually, the sinister stench of death and decay within the castle walls drove Gwylloch, Ketheryll, and his court insane. On the evening of the [[Summer Solstice]] in the {{YearlinkName|299}}, all of them turned on each other with murderous blood frenzy. Tales also or alternatively claimed that the [[wizard]] [[Flamsterd (person)|Flamsterd]], in concert with the [[Earthmother]] herself, blanketed the castle with a black fog that caused it to simply vanish along with all occupants save for a disgruntled follower of Ketheryll named [[Garius]].\n\nRegardless, the castle was abandoned by the living from that point on. Over the following centuries, the castle passed into legend, both as a site haunted by a [[curse]]d Prince Ketheryll but also a place filled with treasure. It became a topic of tales told to frighten children.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the [[halfling]] [[adventurer]] [[Pawldo]] and his companion Stefanik sought out the castle after the latter found a valuable [[dagger]] bearing a skull insignia. The pair dared to delve into the castle seeking treasure, but encountered the monstrous Ketheryll. They survived, but acquired only a pair of [[ring]]s that had belonged to the ancient king and queen of Corwell, [[Durnhal]] and [[Morgan (queen)|Morgan]], who had long ago been killed by Ketheryll.",
        "Inhabitants": "The castle was guarded by the [[spirit]]s of those who had died there. The upper floors were infested with monstrous reptiles including [[basilisk]]s, [[giant snake]]s, and (it was rumored) a [[green dragon]]. The subterranean levels were haunted by powerful [[undead]] that guarded the buried remains of [[warrior]]s, [[knight]]s, and kings with their rich and [[magic]]al treasures. These undead included [[ghost]]s, [[specter]]s, and a [[lich]]. This was the undead remnant of Prince Ketheryll, who would lure travers into the castle with [[illusion|illusory]] treasure only to transform them into such treasures.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "As of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], local legend claimed that the castle only appeared once in a generation in the period between the new and full [[moon]] of the Summer Solstice."
