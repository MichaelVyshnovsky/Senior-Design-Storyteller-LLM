        "mainbody": "The '''Way of Screaming Swords''' was a magical [[portal]] linking the [[Realm of the Mount]] to the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].",
        "Location": "On the Realm of the Mount side, the portal could be found in [[Hool]], inside the ruins of [[Xavander Relurvor]]'s mansion. On the Ravens Bluff side, it was located in a back alley of the [[Ravens Bluff/Harbor District|Harbor District]].",
        "Usage": "The ''Way'' was a one-user-at-a-time portal that could be activated by stepping on a particular stone. On the Ravens Bluff side, one had to pronounce the phrase \"All praise Xavander\" in order to activate it.",
        "Defenses": "The portal was protected by the eponymous Screaming Swords: four flying, sword-shaped \"needles\" of magical force. They would attack anyone casting magic at the portal, and would also attack any \"foe\" designated by the Dread King [[Helemvo Relurvor]] if they approached too close. Those swords generated a high-pitched wailing sound, which gave them their name.\n\nIn addition, the portal on the Realm of the Mount side was protected by several [[golem]]s and other [[construct]]s installed by Helemvo, as well as floating disembodied eyes keeping watch over the ruined mansion and serving as a proxy for his spells.",
        "History": "The portal was built by the [[wizard]] Xavander Relurvor after the foundation of his realm ''circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1319}}."
