The '''Defiant Gesture''' was an [[inn]] located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The inn was located in south Zhentil Keep in the western section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] just off of [[Twilight Street]].

==Description==
The Defiant Gesture stood three storys high and was well-maintained. A signboard depicting a [[human]] hand with thumb and pinky touching adorned the entrance. This was considered to be a rude gesture in Zhentil Keep.

==Activities==
The inn rented 24 rooms at a rate of 10 [[gp]] per night. Stables found behind the inn could be used for 5 gp per night. Baths were 1 gp, meals 4 gp, and a mug of pathetic [[ale]] was 4 [[sp]]. The steep prices reflected the difficulty in importing quality food into the city following its destruction in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.

==Inhabitants==
A retired [[Zhentilar]] [[warrior]] named [[Trevis Uhl]] ran the inn in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. A trio of young serving girls worked at the inn as well.
