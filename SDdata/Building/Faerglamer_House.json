        "mainbody": "Faerglamer House was the residence of Bilnur Faerglamer through the late 9 and throughout the 10 century DR.\nThe house was in Tethyr.\nDuring Bilnurs stay, the house was inhabited by him alone, with piles of coins abandoned across the floor birds nested freely inside the abandoned rooms. The outside of the house remained overgrown and somewhat dilapidated. After he died, the house slowly turned into a ruin, broken open to the sky.\nBilnur Faerglamer lived there and used it as a workshop.\nWhile Bilnur lived there, he had a number of guardians, probably variants of helmed horrors with more power than normal those melted apart after his death.\nPrior to the , the house had been built for a then-extinct family. Bilnur Faerglamer lived in the house from around , the better part of seventy years prior to , to , the year of his death. After his death, the house decayed into a ruin, with the coinage stashed there soon taken.\nThough the coins that Bilnur hoarded had been taken long since, some mages of the late 14 century DR still expected to find a cache somewhere in the ruined and overgrown manor. However, there were rumors of often invisible shapechangers hunting visitors to the ruins.\n*Bilnur Faerglamer"
