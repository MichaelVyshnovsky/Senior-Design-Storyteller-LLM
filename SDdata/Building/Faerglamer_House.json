        "mainbody": "'''Faerglamer House''' was the residence of [[Bilnur Faerglamer]] through the late 9{{th}} and throughout the 10{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The house was in [[Tethyr]].",
        "Interior": "During Bilnur's stay, the house was inhabited by him alone, with piles of coins abandoned across the floor; birds nested freely inside the abandoned rooms. The outside of the house remained overgrown and somewhat dilapidated. After he died, the house slowly turned into a ruin, broken open to the sky.",
        "Activities": "Bilnur Faerglamer lived there and used it as a workshop.",
        "Defenses": "While Bilnur lived there, he had a number of guardians, probably variants of [[helmed horror]]s with more power than normal; those melted apart after his death.",
        "History": "Prior to the {{YearlinkName|882}}, the house had been built for a then-extinct family. [[Bilnur Faerglamer]] lived in the house from around {{yearlink|882}}, the better part of seventy years prior to {{yearlink|952}}, to {{yearlink|977}}, the year of his death. After his death, the house decayed into a ruin, with the coinage stashed there soon taken.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Though the coins that Bilnur hoarded had been taken long since, some mages of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] still expected to find a cache somewhere in the ruined and overgrown manor. However, there were rumors of often invisible shapechangers hunting visitors to the ruins.",
