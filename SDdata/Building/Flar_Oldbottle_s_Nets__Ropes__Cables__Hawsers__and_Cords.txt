'''Flar Oldbottle's Nets, Ropes, Cables, Hawsers, and Cords''' was a warehouse and a shop in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Flar Oldbottle's Nets and a shop attached to its northern wall, a small shack called [[Jumble's Fresh Fish]], was located on the eastern side of the canal that connected [[the Basin]] with the [[Dragonmere]] lake on the southern side of Suzail. It stood to the northwest of [[Silverscales Street]]. In an alley between Flar Oldbottle's Nets and its southern neighborâ€“[[Red Sunsets Trading Company]] warehouse, was hidden ''[[Jusk's Stroll]]'', a ''[[gate]]-link'' that functioned exclusively under cover of the night and connected this alley with the alley behind [[Dragon's Jaws]] tavern.

==Exterior==
Flar Oldbottle's warehouse was a thick, long, two-storied building with a hammerbeam wooden loft and [[slate]] roof perched atop.

==History==
Flar Oldbottle's Nets, Ropes, Cables, Hawsers, and Cords once belonged to a wealthy [[hin]] investor from Suzail named [[Imprur Jusk]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR. The halfling was the person who discovered ''Jusk's Stroll'' ''gate'' hidden behind his warehouse.
