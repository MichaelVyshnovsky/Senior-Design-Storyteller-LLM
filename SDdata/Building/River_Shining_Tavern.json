        "mainbody": "The River Shining Tavern was a tavern in Daggerford in the late 15 century DR. It was named for a nickname of the Delimbiyr River. The proprietors of the building also used \"Delimbiyr\" as their family name.\nThe tavern was located in southwest Daggerford along the eastern perimeter of the drill field.\nThe owners claimed that this tavern predated every other building in town. It was also rumored to be the place where Tyndal lived during the construction of the first ducal castle. While Darfin Floshin could disprove the tale, many fond memories of time spent inside the cozy rooms of the River Shining Tavern kept his lips sealed.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the tavern was staffed by the human head chief Kaga and the head waiter Jacque.\nThe River Shining Tavern was a large building made from wood. Though aging, the structure remained solid.\nMost of the clientele of the tavern had plenty of coin to spend. Patrons included rich merchants, traveling nobles, and prominent citizens of Daggerford like Darfin Floshin and Lady Belinda Anteos of the Sword Coast Traders Bank.\nThe Council of Guilds used the private dining chambers of the River Shining for many of their meetings, appreciating the air of importance the tavern lent to their affairs. Tavern prices were rather steep but were backed by fantastic service and atmosphere. Splendid rooms were available on the second floor, including three highly expensive suites."
