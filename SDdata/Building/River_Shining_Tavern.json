        "mainbody": "The '''River Shining Tavern''' was a tavern in [[Daggerford]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was named for a nickname of the [[Delimbiyr River]]. The proprietors of the building also used \"Delimbiyr\" as their family name.",
        "Location": "The tavern was located in southwest Daggerford along the eastern perimeter of the drill field.{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "History": "The owners claimed that this tavern predated every other building in town. It was also rumored to be the place where [[Tyndal]] lived during the construction of the first ducal castle. While [[Darfin Floshin]] could disprove the tale, many fond memories of time spent inside the cozy rooms of the River Shining Tavern kept his lips sealed.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the tavern was staffed by the [[human]] head chief [[Kaga]] and the head waiter [[Jacque]].<ref>",
        "Description": "The River Shining Tavern was a large building made from wood. Though aging, the structure remained solid.",
        "Patrons": "Most of the clientele of the tavern had plenty of coin to spend. Patrons included rich merchants, traveling nobles, and prominent citizens of Daggerford like Darfin Floshin and Lady [[Belinda Anteos]] of the [[Sword Coast Traders' Bank]].",
        "Atmosphere": "The [[Council of Guilds]] used the private dining chambers of the River Shining for many of their meetings, appreciating the air of importance the tavern lent to their affairs. Tavern prices were rather steep but were backed by fantastic service and atmosphere. Splendid rooms were available on the second floor, including three highly expensive suites."
