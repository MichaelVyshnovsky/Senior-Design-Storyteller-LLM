        "mainbody": "'''Polly's All Night Pastry Emporium''', or simply '''Polly's''', was a bakery, café, and pastry catering business that operated in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Polly's All Night Pastry Emporium was a several-story-tall building, with the shop taking the first floor and rental apartments above it. It was located two streets west and half a mile north from the [[Jack Jaw]] rowdy drinking establishment. At night, the street on which Polly's stood was illuminated by a pleasant red radiance of street lights.",
        "Interior": "The shop's interior felt a bit out of place among the establishments that surrounded it. The dining room of the café was plush with [[velvet]] fabrics and massive woven rugs and throws. The room was made out of dark hardwood. The dark wood floors were covered by comfy rugs and hardwood furniture was upholstered. A warm fireplace illuminated the room with a large birdcage hung above.",
        "Services": "The cage was the office, of sorts, where the Emporium's original proprietor–[[Polly (Ravens Bluff)|Polly]], could be found. The large green [[parrot]] with an [[eyepatch]] was the establishment's mascot who greeted guests in human speech, periodically squawking like an ordinary parrot would. The parrot did her best to run the Emporium out of her cage despite having difficulties with writing and reading. She sold the bakery's pastries to the guests and fulfilled catering orders that were prepared by two teams of employees who worked day and night shifts.",
        "History": "Polly's All Night Pastry Emporium was in operation for several decades by the late 14{{th}} century DR. Its owner, Polly, once made a deal with the powerful [[cleric]] of [[Tyr]], [[Seejil]]. She sold him a [[lion]]'s share of the Emporium for the price of most of the [[cleric]]'s savings. Part of the deal was that in case Polly was ever killed, she would be brought back to life and to health by Seejil. Sometime later, Polly died in a [[horse]] [[carriage]] accident, but Seejil was unable to ''[[resurrect]]'' his business partner because of a misadventure that made Tyr turn away from the man, stripping Seejil of all of his [[divine]] magic. Thankfully, Seejil convinced a [[druid]] friend to use the ''reincarnation'' spell on Polly, technically fulfilling the agreed-upon obligation. She was ''reincarnated'' as a big green parrot.\n\nSeveral years after a group of adventurers helped to redeem Seejil's name, [[Sorduel Meytauc]] of the [[Ill Eagle Inn]], bought out Polly's pastries to pass them as his own in a competition at the [[Mossbridges]]'s First [[Annual Year-End Festival]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. \"Coincidentally,\" Polly's own invitation to partake in the competition disappeared at the same time.{{Cite organized play/LC/Lord of the Grapes|9-10}}"
