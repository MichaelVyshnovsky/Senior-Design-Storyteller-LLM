        "mainbody": "Pollys All Night Pastry Emporium, or simply Pollys, was a bakery, café, and pastry catering business that operated in Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nPollys All Night Pastry Emporium was a several-story-tall building, with the shop taking the first floor and rental apartments above it. It was located two streets west and half a mile north from the Jack Jaw rowdy drinking establishment. At night, the street on which Pollys stood was illuminated by a pleasant red radiance of street lights.\nThe shops interior felt a bit out of place among the establishments that surrounded it. The dining room of the café was plush with velvet fabrics and massive woven rugs and throws. The room was made out of dark hardwood. The dark wood floors were covered by comfy rugs and hardwood furniture was upholstered. A warm fireplace illuminated the room with a large birdcage hung above.\nThe cage was the office, of sorts, where the Emporiums original proprietor–Polly, could be found. The large green parrot with an eyepatch was the establishments mascot who greeted guests in human speech, periodically squawking like an ordinary parrot would. The parrot did her best to run the Emporium out of her cage despite having difficulties with writing and reading. She sold the bakerys pastries to the guests and fulfilled catering orders that were prepared by two teams of employees who worked day and night shifts.\nPollys All Night Pastry Emporium was in operation for several decades by the late 14 century DR. Its owner, Polly, once made a deal with the powerful cleric of Tyr, Seejil. She sold him a lions share of the Emporium for the price of most of the clerics savings. Part of the deal was that in case Polly was ever killed, she would be brought back to life and to health by Seejil. Sometime later, Polly died in a horse carriage accident, but Seejil was unable to resurrect his business partner because of a misadventure that made Tyr turn away from the man, stripping Seejil of all of his divine magic. Thankfully, Seejil convinced a druid friend to use the reincarnation spell on Polly, technically fulfilling the agreed-upon obligation. She was reincarnated as a big green parrot.\nSeveral years after a group of adventurers helped to redeem Seejils name, Sorduel Meytauc of the Ill Eagle Inn, bought out Pollys pastries to pass them as his own in a competition at the Mossbridgess First Annual Year-End Festival in the . \"Coincidentally,\" Pollys own invitation to partake in the competition disappeared at the same time."
