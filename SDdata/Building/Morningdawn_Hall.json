        "mainbody": "'''Morningdawn Hall''' was a temple to [[Lathander]] in the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]] in [[Shadowdale]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was shaped like a [[phoenix]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was built in the shape of a [[phoenix]], with each stone wing curving up to form two towers on either side of its double-door entrance.",
        "Services": "For a time in the mid—14{{th}} century, temple services were led by High Morninglord [[Rewel Thunderstorm]]. During his tenure he was served by seven lesser priests.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[sage]] of Shadowdale [[Elminster]] took the young [[magic-user]] [[Midnight]] to the temple, in order to complete a [[ritual]] that would bring forth the [[Eye of Eternity]]. Due to the instability of [[the Weave]] he inadvertently opened a ''[[portal]]'' to the plane of [[Gehenna]]. Meanwhile, the [[avatar]] of the god [[Bane]] and an elemental form of [[Mystra]] fought a terrible battle at the temple, as Elminster attempted to close the otherworldly rift. As the [[Celestial Stairway]] opened up above them, Bane was destroyed, Elminster dove through the ''portal'' to close it from the other side, and Morningdawn Hall was leveled in the ensuing explosion.\n\nYears later, after the [[Zhentarim]] invasion in [[Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Morningdawn Hall destroyed for the second time, this time in a great fire. The clergy of Lathander were all killed or forced to flee the village of Shadowdale."
