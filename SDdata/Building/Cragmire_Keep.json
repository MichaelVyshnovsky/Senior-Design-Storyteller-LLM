        "mainbody": "'''Cragmire Keep''' was the familial stronghold of the noble [[Cragmire]] family of [[Neverwinter]], before its destruction in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Over a century later it was claimed by the brothers that led the [[Blackdagger Bandits]] and came to be known as '''Blackdagger Keep''' and later on '''Grimstorm Keep'''.",
        "Location": "It was located just north of the city of [[Neverwinter]], constructed within the rocky hills that overlooked [[Raven Cliff Beach]]. It could be readily accessed by traveling a short distance away from the [[High Road]].",
        "Structure": "Cragmire Keep was well defended by both its location atop a rocky hill, and the strong outer stone walls. A stone pathway curved along the side of the stone cliff leading up to a wide bridge that gave way to the keep's main entrance, and the two turrets that flanked its portcullis. \n\nAn outer bailey surrounded the central structure of the keep, much of which had been leveled during Cragmire's storied history.\n\nThe rear entrance of the keep opened to a rickety wooden bridge that extended to a small [[earthmote]] that hung above the nearby beach. While it appeared a stone town once stood atop this rocky formation, it too had been destroyed.",
        "Interior": "A portion Cragmire Keep's ground floor remained intact, as did its expansive cellars, dungeon, and the Cragmire family crypts. Within its bowels, the pirate leader [[Jareth Grim]] built a makeshift throne room for himself, despite the fact his \"rule\" as a pirate lord was merely a façade.",
        "Activities": "For much of its history, the former noble manor-keep languished as a set of ruins, largely ignored by groups of any significance. Over time it became a haven for criminals, bandits, and other outlaws.",
        "History": "[[File:Cragmire Keep Rear.png|thumb|right|400px|The rear entrance of Cragmire Keep overlooking the beach ''circa'' [[1479 DR]]]]\nThe keep was named after the Neverwintan Cragmire noble family and remained a part of their holdings until the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. When it was revealed that the family were carrying out [[necromantic]] rituals from within the depths of their stronghold, and plotting to use monstrous undead to takeover Neverwinter, the city's army interceded. Neverwintan soldiers besieged the keep in the {{YearlinkName|1328}}, destroying nearly all the aboveground structure.\n\nThe Blackdagger Bandits took control of the keep sometime around their rise to prominence during the mid–to–late 15{{th}} century, as the city of Neverwinter gradually returned to glory following the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}. While Jareth Grim remained the public enemy to the travelers of the [[High Road]], the bandits' true leaders were the brothers  [[Traven Blackdagger|Traven]] and [[Malus Blackdagger]], each of whom were undead pirate lords.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Heroes of Neverwinter]] ventured across the ruined courtyard of Grimstorm Keep killing many of the Blackdagger Bandits, their [[Red Wizard]] allies, and scores of skeletal minions. They confronted Malus Blackdagger in the heart of his stronghold, destroying the [[undead]] pirate, leaving only Traven in the [[Cragmire Crypts]] to stand between them and the eradication of the bandit gang."
