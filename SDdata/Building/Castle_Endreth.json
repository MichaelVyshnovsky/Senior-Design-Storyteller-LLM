        "mainbody": "'''Castle Endreth''' was a crumbling ruin near [[Starmantle]]. It was used by the [[Magister]] [[Talatha Vaerovree]] as a ''[[refuge]]''.",
        "Location": "The keep was near [[Starmantle]].",
        "Structure": "It was a roofless heap by the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, with extensive, leaky cellars reached by a long, descending hallway.",
        "Defenses": "The hallway to the cellars was extensive and powerfully trapped. The spells still shielding it acted as a ''[[shield]]'' against anything not being wielded by a living creature, reflected all ''[[lightning bolt]]''-related spells directly back at their target, and had a quickly alternating ''[[reverse gravity]]'' trap that continuously dropped anyone not thinking the correct password {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} back and forth between floor and ceiling. Talatha kept a ''[[stone of magic missiles]]'' hidden along the passageway.",
        "Activities": "In the cellars, Talatha Vaerovree kept six ''[[potions of extra healing]]'' in silvered steel vials, a ''[[potion of vitality]]'' in a silver vial and an ''[[elixir of health]]'' in a red-painted steel vial. They were all hidden in a chest underneath a pool of water opaque with sediment.\n\n[[Weavespinners]] had orders to regularly scour the ruin of monsters.",
        "History": "The castle was named after the warrior who built it. The structure was shown by [[Azuth]] to [[Talatha Vaerovree]] as a good place to lose pursuers and rest.",
        "Inhabitants": "The castle found itself inhabited by [[kobold]]s, [[troll]]s, or [[peryton]]s from time to time, only to be cleared by [[weavespinner]]s sent by that purpose."
