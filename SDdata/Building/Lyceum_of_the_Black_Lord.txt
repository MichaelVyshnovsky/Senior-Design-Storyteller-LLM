The Lyceum of the Black Lord was a temple of Bane found in the city of Phlan during the 15 century DR. For a time it was a place of great importance, as the worship of Bane was the prevalent faith among Phlans citizens.
The temple was located in Nobles Quarter of Phlans Old City.
The lyceum was a specimen of exquisite architecture, featuring fitted stone walls ascending up to a domed ceiling.
Beneath the temple was a secret prison used by Phlans Knights of the Black Fist soldiers to illegally interrogate and even kill those they took prisoner. These dungeons were accessible by underground tunnels that linked to caves along the shore of the River Stojanow.
The interior of temple walls were covered with a coat of smooth white plaster.
In what was seen as a profound heresy by the greater church of Bane, the priests of the Lyceum of the Black Lord maintained that Banes existence was wholly annihilated by the god Torm during the Avatar Crisis. They believed the being that emerged in the Realms a few years later was in fact Iyachtu Xvim who had claimed his divine fathers name and likeness in order to achieve greater power.
The priests of the temple differed from other Banite clergy in another significant manner they close to maintained reasonable ideological beliefs, focusing on the tenets of restraint and deference to the citys powers.
At some point prior to the 14 century DR, the temple was once dedicated to the god of suffering Ilmater.
Some time after the Dragon Run that devastated Phlan in the , the temple was taken over the half-orc Banite cleric called Mace. Maces orc minions ran amok throughout the surrounding affluent neighborhood of the city.
An adventuring party delved into the depths of the ruined temple in Old Phlan to search for old Ilmatari relics, at the behest of the gnome cleric Dirtan. It was unknown if they were ultimately successful in their endeavor.
The temple remained in ruin as of the , but eventually grew to become the most distinguished place of worship in the city.
Some time after the , the temple fell to ruin once again and no worshipers of Bane or any other deity practiced their faith within. After the green dragon Vorgansharax claimed Phlan as his own and his Tears of Virulence followers overrun the city streets, the Lyceum of the Black Lord became the site of a battle between them and the allied forces that remained loyal to Phlan over all others.
