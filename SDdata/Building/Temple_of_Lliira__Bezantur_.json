        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Lliira''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Lliira]], the [[goddess]] of joy, in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in southern-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Talona (Bezantur)|Temple of Talona]], the [[Temple of Auril (Bezantur)|Temple of Auril]], the [[Temple of Oghma (Bezantur)|Temple of Oghma]], the [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Temple of Sune]], the [[Temple of Helm (Bezantur)|Temple of Helm]], and the [[Temple of Malar (Bezantur)|Temple of Malar]]. It was also quite close to the [[Temple of Umberlee (Bezantur)|Temple of Umberlee]], [[Ilmater's Cathedral]], and the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]].",
        "Structure": "The temple consisted of a central hall made of white [[marble]] surrounded by multicolored pavilions and tents.",
        "Activities": "The temple was a joyful place that advocated for hedonism, altruism, and individualism. This made the temple moderately popular with the decadent citizens of Bezantur, but decidedly unpopular among the [[Red Wizards]] who ruled the city."
