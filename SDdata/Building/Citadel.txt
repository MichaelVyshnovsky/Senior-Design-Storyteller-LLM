The '''Citadel''' was an ancient fortress-complex in [[Thay]] that served as the inner sanctum of [[Szass Tam]] and the country's infamous [[Red Wizards]]. Even before the wash of [[undeath]] overcame Thay, the Citadel was said to be an unholy place, haunted by utmost [[evil]] and teeming with secrets that should never see the light of day.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Location==
The Citadel was located atop the tallest peak of [[Thaymount]], a chain of volcanic mountains in the heart of [[Thaymount (tharch)|the tharch]] that shared their name.

==Structure==
The central keep of the Citadel had a broad, flat roof that granted a panoramic view of the fortress-city beneath and the Thaymount mountains beyond.

Most of the Citadel and its dungeons were built by the fortress's original builders, and later expanded upon by its Red Wizard inhabitants. In its entirety, the Citadel was believed to have been similar in size and scope to the dungeon-complex of [[Undermountain]], found on the opposite side of [[Faerûn]].

==Interior==
One of the notable structures within the Citadel was its palace, which was the personal residence of Szass Tam. While the regent of Thay spent little time within his residence, the palace served as a place to house his greatest trophies and as a venue for the outlandish celebrations of the Thayan elite class.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|12}}

Beneath the Citadel were a series of dungeons that were strictly off limits―even to most Red Wizards. They were reserved only for those that committed crimes against Thay, undead that required eventual destruction, and select students of Szass Tam himself.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|7}} They were a lawless place of abject squalor,{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|21}} home to scores of undead, petty scavengers, and lawless gangs that eked out meager existences within.

Although much of the Citadel's lowest depths were never fully explored and charted, some information regarding the so-called [[Paths of the Doomed]] had been revealed over the course of the years.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|38-39}}

===Atmosphere===
The walls within the deepest bowels of the Citadel were decorated with deteriorating yet still-intact bas-reliefs and wall paintings of unknown origin. These works of art were created by the sarrukh,{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|25}} the progenitor race of the [[lizardfolk]],

==Notable Locations==
Within the Citadel's dungeon-complex were numerous smaller establishments, including residences, shops, and the like:
* The [[Last Stop (Citadel)|Last Stop]], a trading post that was situated in the lower reaches of the Citadel, immediately before a tunnel that led into the fortress's dungeons. Merchants, slavers, and agents of Thay all competed for the opportunity to take ownership of newly arrived slaves and glean whatever gossip or news from the world beyond that would benefit them the best.
* [[Ravensblood Academy]], an arcane academy for spellcasters found within the Citadel's dungeons. It catered to [[necromancer]]s whom Szass Tam personally found promising.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|28}}
* [[Word of Recall]], a specialized boutique in which mages offered a respite to denizens of the dungeons, in exchange for their memories and whatever meager coins they could offer.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|32}}

==Activities==
The Citadel was connected to the Red Wizards' numerous [[dread ring]]s established across the Realms, set in a specific pattern of arcane importance.{{Page needed}} This mystic arrangement was a necessary component of the ''[[ritual of the unmaking]]'', the so-called "great work" that Szass Tam sought to achieve.

==Defenses==
Much of the Citadel was protected by arcane [[ward]]s, which were set atop pre-existing enchantments placed by the Citadel's original builders.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|73}}

==History==
The Citadel was an ancient structure with origins unknown to most across the Realms. It was constructed by the sarrukh race,{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|35}} well before the first millennium pre-[[Dale Reckoning]].

After taking over the Citadel proper, the Red Wizards led a number of expeditions into the fortress's depths, with varying results. Some groups managed to extricate large caches of treasure, while most others never returned from within.

===14{{th}} Century===
{{Quote|My agents in Thay report that Szass Tam has hidden himself away in the Citadel, an ancient fortress deep in Thaymount. They say he is preparing some new outrage. What it is I do not know.|The Simbul, 1368 DR.}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, Citadel and in fact all of Thaymount became engulfed with Red Wizard activities. [[Tharchion]]s from across Thay, along with [[zulkir]]s of the [[Council of Zulkirs|eponymous council]] made numerous visits to the region, and doubled and redoubled the number of troops they garrisoned within.

A [[1368 DR|few years later]], the ever-curious [[Simbul]] recruited a band of [[adventurer]]s to infiltrate the Citadel and investigate Szass Tam and whatever schemes he was surely concocting.

According to history books a century later, and as [[Xenk Yendar]] would recall, in the mid-1370s [[DR]], Szass Tam called all the other zulkirs and all the people of the Thaymount tharch, Xenk and his parents among them, to a grand celebration atop the Citadel on [[Kythorn 19|the eve]] of the [[summer solstice]]. A few of the common people carried sun symbols.<ref group="note">''Honor Among Thieves'' only says "the capital" of Thay, which at the time should be [[Eltabbar]]. However, it is presumed Xenk lived in Thaymount, owing to him bearing Tam's tattoo and the apparent depiction of the Citadel. Moreover, Xenk may be referring to it as the present capital. Therefore, the Citadel is presumed instead.<ref group="note">''Honor Among Thieves'' mentions only the eve of the solstice; due to the presence of sun-like symbols in the crowd, this is presumed to be the summer solstice. The newly revived sun god [[Amaunator]] has a similar holy symbol and treats the summer solstice as a holy day, suggesting a link to the celebration. But it was all a lie—instead, Szass interrupted Zulkir [[Dmitra Flass]] as she addressed the crowd and produced a red horn from under his robes. With it, he cast the ''beckoning death'', thereby creating an army of undead under his control for his coup and following conquest of Thay. All who tried to flee were slain by Red Wizards in his service, among them [[Sofina]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} Xenk saw a girl his age, [[Ishira]], standing alone and lost in the panic.It is difficult to reconcile Xenk's account and the scenes in ''Honor Among Thieves'' with the established history of Szass Tam, the zulkirs, and Thay, as Tam's betrayal here contradicts his betrayals elsewhere. It appears to conflate the zulkirs gathering at the Citadel in ''The Crimson Gold'' in 1373 DR; the meeting of the [[Council of Zulkirs]] in Eltabbar, the start of the War of the Zulkirs, and Tam's takeover of Thay in ''Unclean'' in 1375 DR; and a later new event of Tam creating his undead armies from his subjects. Since this is presented as a story from a book a century later and from Xenk's childhood memories, it's presumed to be a case of unreliable narration or movie dramatization.

===15{{th}} Century===
Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1490}}, the corpse of murdered [[storm giant]] king [[Hekaton]] was taken to the dungeons within the Citadel,{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|2}} and raised as a colossal undead [[death knight]].{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|31}}

==Rumors & Legends==
According to reports from some agents working with the scholar [[Lhaeo]], the Citadel housed a population of [[drow]] during the mid–14{{th}} century DR.

There was believed to exist a specific [[book]] that detailed at least some of what would be encountered within the Citadel's Paths of the Doomed.

==Inhabitants==
It was said that some members of the race that originally built the Citadel still resided within its depths as of the mid–14{{th}} century DR.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Lauzoril]], a former Red Wizard who frequented the Last Stop trading post.{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|26}}
* [[Sharade Quilbax]], an agent who operated on behalf of [[Damand]] the [[zulkir]] of [[divination]].{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|26}}
