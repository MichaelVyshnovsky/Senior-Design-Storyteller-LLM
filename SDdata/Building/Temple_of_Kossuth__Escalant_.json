        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Kossuth''' in [[Escalant]], [[Thay]], was a place of worship dedicated to the [[fire]] [[god]] [[Kossuth]]. It concealed a secret ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], known as the '''''Portal'' of Fire'''.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of Thay: The Portal of Fire}}",
        "Interior": "A vault inside the temple contained the permanent one-way ''Portal'' of Fire leading to the Plane of Fire. The ''[[portal]]'' was a {{SIAdj|15|foot|long=yes|adj=radius}} stone archway that was always aflame, an effect achieved via a clever system of small tubes within the stone through which slow-burning [[alchemist's fire]] was regularly piped to the arch's surface.",
        "History": "The ''portal'' was created during the [[Salamander War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, in a joint effort between the [[Red Wizard]] [[Aznar Thrul]] and the [[Kossuthan]] clergy of the temple. After successfully beseeching Kossuth to send [[fire elemental]]s to drive back Thay's [[salamander]] foes, Thrul arranged for this ''portal'' to be created so that the salamanders could be forced back to their home [[plane]]. The existence of the ''portal'' was kept a secret, at least in part because Thrul hoped to one day find a means to use it to his advantage against his rivals by creating a return ''portal''. Thrul was able to monitor the ''portal''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> use, and was aware if anyone passed through it. Meanwhile, the banished salamanders remained bitter, and would slay anyone who dared cross the threshold into their home plane.\n\nAs of {{Yearlink|1372}}, Thrul recognized that he would need to expel the Kossuthans and seize control of the temple if he wished to realize his ambition of creating a two-way ''portal''. However, the existence of the ''portal'' was no longer a secret by this time, and tales and rumors about it had spread throughout Escalant. Such rumors often misunderstood the purpose of the ''portal'', and frequently speculated that it allowed creatures from the Plane of Fire to travel into the [[Prime Material plane]] (whether on behalf of Kossuth or on behalf of Thay's salamander enemies). Still other tales had begun to suggest that the ''portal'' did not lead to the Plane of Fire at all, but instead to a secret treasury of dark Red Wizard secrets.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple's Kossuthan [[priest]]s were tasked with defending the ''Portal'' of Fire. However, they were amenable to negotiating access to the ''portal'' for those looking to sneak out of Escalant, and were especially willing to help followers of their god or his allies. These priests were also known to enjoy a trip to the [[tavern]]s, and were thus responsible for creating some of the rumors about the ''portal''."
