Temple of Chauntea was one of two temples in the town of Mossbridges in the late 14 century DR.
This humble temple offered various clerical spells cast for travelers and other visitors. The service did not come cheap, the base fee was one hundred gold pieces and it increased by another hundred for each subsequent circle of divine magic cast. The priests skills were limited to magics of the fist through third circles of divine magic.
In the late 14 century DR, the Mossbridges Temple of Chauntea was run by a paladin who had fallen out of favor with their previous deity â€“ Tyr, and split from the towns temple dedicated to Grimjaws.
