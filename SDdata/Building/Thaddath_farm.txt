The Thaddath farm was a small ruined structure located in the village of Eveningstar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The farm was located on the northern outskirts of Eveningstar.
The Thaddath farm had a barn and a small stone tower house. The barn was half burned and sagging.
The farm lay vacant since the Thaddath family died out during the early-to-mid 14 century DR. The vacant stone tower was once a popular spot for young lovers to meet in secret, but was later used as a dump and midden for the village.
