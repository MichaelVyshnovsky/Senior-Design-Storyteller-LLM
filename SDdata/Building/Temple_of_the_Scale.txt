The '''Temple of the Scale''' was an underground temple located under the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5-6,10-17}}

==Location==
The temple's entrance was hidden below a [[menhir]] circle, protected by a complex system of shifting stones.

==Structure==
The temple was built using [[druid]]ic magic and [[kobold]] labor.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The temple's only inhabitants were [[undead]] druids, who were the last remnants of the [[Druid circle|circle]] who built it. As such, the interior of the place was completely dark and filled with an eerie silence.

===Layout===
[[File:Temple of the scale - map.jpg|thumb|250px|''A plan of the temple.'']]
The temple comprised multiple areas, each with a dedicated purpose.

;The main hall :
This massive room served as a place for druids to eat together and perform ceremonial events, as well as cast [[ritual]] magic. It was supported by three pillars carved in the likeness of [[chromatic dragon]]s supporting the ceiling. The room was decorated on its walls and ceiling by colorful mosaics depicting flying [[dragon]]s, and its doors were painted in bright colors akin to chromatic dragon's scales. The frame of the door across the room from the entrance was made of painted stone carvings depicting [[Tiamat]], the Dragon Queen.

; The living area :
Made of quarters and a kitchen, the living area was kept perfectly ordered by the druids of the circle. Stone shelves carved into the walls were used by the inhabitants to store household items and produces.

; The crypt :
This is the place where the order burned their dead and buried their bones. A pool of water in the center of the room connected to an underground lake, providing fresh water to the druids. The walls and pillars of the room were decorated using the ashes and bones of the dead.

; The circle of worship :
This was the place used by the circle to worship and perform rituals dedicated to Tiamat. In front of the entrance, a massive door of hammered red metal was embossed with the likeness of a rearing [[red dragon]] wearing an amulet&mdash;which was actually the key to open it.

The room was flanked by four stairs leading to smaller shrines containing altars, each dedicated to a different color associated with chromatic dragons: black, blue, green, and white.

; The reliquary :
Covered in red and orange tiles, the reliquary was built by the druids to protect [[Tiamat's scale]], their most prized possession.

==Defenses==
The altars around the circle of worship, in which parts of the key to the reliquary were kept, were all protected by powerful magical traps.

==History==
The temple was built by the [[Circle of the Scale]] in an effort to lure and enslave nearby dragons. Their efforts proved meaningless when the red dragon [[Scorlworyx]] and her armies attacked the circle and put an end to their projects&mdash;and their lives.
