The Clearlight temple was a run-down temple of Tymora in Luskan. The temple took its name from the large stained glass window in the roof which, as of 1480 DR, was the only know glass window remaining in Luskan. The temple was used as the headquarters of the Coin Spinners gang and was heavily reinforced so that it resembled a fortress and the complex was heavily guarded. Most of the statuary had been removed but the idol of Tymora near the altar was more or less intact and the coin-shaped altar remained. The room leading to the inner sanctum occupied by Eden of the Clearlight was heavily trapped.
