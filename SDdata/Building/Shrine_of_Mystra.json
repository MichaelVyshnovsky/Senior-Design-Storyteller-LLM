        "mainbody": "'''The Shrine of Mystra''' was a small cave located a few hundred feet away from the [[Polyandrium]] in [[Myth Drannor]]. The shrine was built on one of the magical lines of power and was open for pilgrims who sought [[Mystra]]'s blessing and the goddess's worshipers who needed a moment of quiet contemplation.",
        "Interior": "The cave was protected by a permanent ''[[hallow]]'' spell, scaring away the creatures of evil alignment. Once a creature entered the Shrine's cave, they felt the magic coursing through, making it almost feel like electricity was hanging in the air.\n\nThe cave had a pool of crystal-clear water that filled a third of the cave, along the northern wall. To the east stood a statue of a beautiful woman, Mystra herself. Upon closer examination, it was clear that the statue depicted Mystra's form preceding the [[Time of Troubles]]. The statue was enchanted to keep the temperature inside the Shrine at a warm spring morning's level. One lonely [[torch]] lit with a ''[[continual flame]]'' spell lit the cave with flickering almost mystical light reflected from the pool of water.\n\n[[File:Polyandrum.png|thumb|273x273px|''A map of the Polyandrium showing the location of the Shrine of Mystra.'']]\nA set of stairs carved out of stone led outside the shrine. The walls around the stairs had ''[[Glyph of warding|glyphs of warding]]'' etched onto them protecting the cave from the [[undead]] and evil extraplanar beings.\n\nSeveral patches of [[blueglow moss]] grew around the cave close to the pool of water.\n\nFrom the outside, the entrance to the Shrine of Mystra was a part of a small stone building surrounded by thick forest.",
        "History": "The Shrine of Mystra was constructed during the early days of Myth Drannor's renaissance.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], a group of adventurers followed the slavers of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] through a one-way ''[[gate]]'' from [[Darnarest's tower]] and emerged inside the Shrine of Mystra."
