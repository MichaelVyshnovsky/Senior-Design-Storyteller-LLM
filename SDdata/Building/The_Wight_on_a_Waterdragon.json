        "mainbody": "'''The Wight on a Waterdragon'''<ref group=\"note\">The Marsember Map Key on p. 43 of ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' erroneously gives the name as The Wight on a Weredragon. was a restaurant in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]].\n\nIt took its name from the sculpture on the roof, shaped into a [[wight]] riding a creature like a [[blue dragon]] but with fins instead of legs. It was carved in Marsember itself by [[Jathoom Berl]].\n\nThe building was formerly used for [[fish]] packing and thus still smelled of fish. It was filled with makeshift furniture but enjoyed good business nonetheless. It served [[Purple Dragon ale|Purple Dragon]] and [[Shadowdark ale|Shadowdark]] ales, [[zzar]], and a homebrew liquor known as [[Harbor Bottom]]. Food consisted of a choice of [[cheese]]s from across the [[Inner Sea]], a seafood [[pie]] made with a variety of seafood and [[potato]]es, a selection of sauces, [[pâté]] and a selection of roasts."
