Past the main entrance stood the shops main room with a clerks counter in the middle, two large window displays of finery and shelves and racks that showed the shops wide selection of clothes, dyes, gowns, cloaks, boots, and hats.\nThe clerks counter had two large doors on each side that opened into the Facemakers workshop, which consisted of three interconnected rooms the clothier to the left and mirror-filled hair-styling to the right, and a lavish waiting area in the middle, separated from the two other rooms by red curtains.\nThe Boutiques second floor was used as living quarters.\nFacemakers Boutique offers a wide variety of fanciful clothes for purchase, styling, and custom-tailoring. Additionally, the establishment helped its customers with makeup and hairstyling, as well as other cosmetic services.\nFacemakers Boutique once was owned by Julio Facemaker, sometime before the late 15 century DR. After Julio passed, his daughter Carmen Facemaker received a massive inheritance of gold, gems, and silks, while the shop and all the hard work and responsibilities were left to his son, Figaro \"Facemaker\" Pennygood, because, as the last will and testament stated, \"A bit of honest labor would do him good.\" However, there were some doubts about the last wills authenticity due to the presence of a forgery kit near where the original document was hidden in the Boutique.\nIn the , during the Absolute crisis, Figaro Pennygood was targeted by the Bhaalist Unholy Assassin aspirant Dolor, who went on a spree of grizzly murders collecting lives and hands of the innocent of Baldurs Gate. Figaro was on the list of targets, and subsequently, an attempt on his life took place. Dolor, accompanied by a group of Bhaalist doppelgangers, poisoned the dwarf clothier with Karabasans gift and set out to slice his neck open. Devella Fountainhead, a constable of the Flaming Fist, interfered, being attracted by the assaults commotion, but was rendered paralyzed by the same toxin. It was unknown whether Figaro survived the attempt on his life or was slaughtered by the Murder Tribunal.\nDuring the same period of time, Figaro Pennygood posted an ad searching for a cut hair sweeper who had to come with their own broom.\nPhlanders Hort was one of the clerks employed by Master Figaro in the late 15 century DR, often found at the center of the shop, behind the counter. Another one of his employees was Bobula Hanvers. The shop also was supplied with gems by Omotola and her Glitter Gala shop nearby.\nSome of the Facemakers Boutiques customers included Hannaah Befling Varce Humbletood, who used the Facemakers hair cutting and styling services the vampire spawn Leon, who served Cazador Szarr Master Durinbold, who commissioned formalwear for his wife to attend Lord Enver Gortashs coronation as well as an anonymous client who sought to change his appearance to avoid assassination."
