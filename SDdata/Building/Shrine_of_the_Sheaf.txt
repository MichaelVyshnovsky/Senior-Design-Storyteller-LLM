The '''Shrine of the Sheaf''', later renamed '''Fox Tower''', was a former keep turned into a shrine to [[Chauntea]] and later commandeered by bandits in the the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Shrine lay across [[Buckralam's Starn]] from the road that led into it.

==Structure==
The place was a former keep. It had a courtyard.

==Interior==
The feast hall was lit by [[candle wheel]]s, and had a minstrels' gallery up top. Bedchambers lay beyond the hall, which also connected to the kitchen. Another passage led to the back of the keep, the pantries, and to '''Beldrun's Room''', which had once been the abode of a priest and since been converted into furniture storage during the takeover by the Iron Fox. The keep had a front gate.

==History==
The place had been a keep originally, and was later converted to a temple of [[Chauntea]]. An old priest named [[Beldrum]] had once had a room there.

Around {{yearlink|755}}, the bandit known as [[Iron Fox]] led his forces in seizing the Shrine for as a defensible position from which they could control [[Starn (Valley)|The Starn]]. They had some minor repairs done; evicted the local priest, [[Rarendon]]; and kidnapped any local woman they desired.

In the {{yearlinkName|761}}, the Iron Fox's forces were broken and decimated by the combined efforts of the [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Elminster Aumar]] and a local woman, [[Immeira]].
