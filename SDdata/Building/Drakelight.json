This massive lighthouse stood  tall.\nIn order to protect the Drakelight from pirate retaliation, Soorenar, Luthcheq, and Mordulkin each sent a detachment of one hundred soldiers to garrison the lighthouse. The soldiers stationed here were sworn to work together even if their parent cities were at war with each other."
