It belonged to Daeghun Farlong.\nThe house was located beyond the river, north of the center of the village. There was a bridge that connected to the center, but that bridge was later destroyed.\nThe house was wooden, like the other houses of West Harbor.\nThe house was composed of two levels the first had a hall and a fireplace, while the other had two bedrooms, for Daeghun and his foster child.\nThis was the house where Daeghun and the Kalach-Cha lived. When the two escaped West Harbor following the Second War of the Shadow in 1374 DR, the house was destroyed when Ammon Jerro and his demons passed through the village.\nIt was here that the Kalach-Cha lived through their childhood."
