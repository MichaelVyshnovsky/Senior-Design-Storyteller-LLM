        "mainbody": "The '''Troll in Flames''' was the only inn in the hamlet of [[Mornbryn's Shield]]. It was run by a gruff [[gnome]] named [[Flanagus Gnarlybone]]. The Troll had a one-item menu, for tiny rooms, but offered a selection of alcohol ''circa'' [[1365 DR]].",
        "Description": "Technically, the Troll in Flames was a tavern that mainly served alcohol, but it did offer limited lodgings. The small inn rented four of its tiny rooms on a nightly basis. The rooms in the Troll were truly small and could at best fit three people per room with one of them having to sleep on the floorboards.\n\nThe Troll in Flames' name came from the local color, that of constant danger looming in the Evermoors. The [[troll]] raids were quite common, and the locals could always appreciate a troll in flames, such as the tavern's signboard that hung above the main doorsâ€”a laughing troll's head covered in flames.\n\nThe innkeeper Gnarlybone was known to order and save certain [[wine]]s and [[ale]]s especially for regular customers he knew to expect.",
