        "mainbody": "he Troll in Flames was the only inn in the hamlet of Mornbryns Shield. It was run by a gruff gnome named Flanagus Gnarlybone. The Troll had a one-item menu, for tiny rooms, but offered a selection of alcohol circa 1365 DR.\nTechnically, the Troll in Flames was a tavern that mainly served alcohol, but it did offer limited lodgings. The small inn rented four of its tiny rooms on a nightly basis. The rooms in the Troll were truly small and could at best fit three people per room with one of them having to sleep on the floorboards.\nThe Troll in Flames name came from the local color, that of constant danger looming in the Evermoors. The troll raids were quite common, and the locals could always appreciate a troll in flames, such as the taverns signboard that hung above the main doorsâ€”a laughing trolls head covered in flames.\nThe innkeeper Gnarlybone was known to order and save certain wines and ales especially for regular customers he knew to expect.\nWhen adventurers or merchants found themselves in the Troll in Flames overnight, they were happy to know that the price of 2 sp they paid included a flagon of ale and a basket of spread bread made with abundant local river fish called silverlings. Spread bread was the only food item served at the Troll in Flames.\nThe main business here came from the drinks. The tavern carried a small selection of good ales and wines. The alcohol was sold by the pitcher for ales and by the bottle for wines. The most expensive alcohols available were usually zzar, Saerloonian Glowfire, and evershimmer.\nPrices of food and services circa 1365 DR\n* Lodging 2 sp per person a night\n* Beers and ales from 7 sp to 1 gp and\n* Wines from 9 sp to 9 gp."
