        "mainbody": "'''House Jordain''' was an academy for the [[Jordain vizier]]s located on the southern coast of [[Halruaa]], looking over the [[Great Sea]]. This is where the viziers were educated, both in the world at large as well as in the political machinations of their home kingdom.\n\n{{quote|''A jordain thinks first, and only then speaks.\"''|Jordaini proverb}}\n\nAlthough the academy formally answered to the [[Netyarch]], in reality they were an independent institution that only answered to the [[Halruaan magehound|magehounds]].",
        "Entomology": "The word \"jordain\" originated from the [[Old Netherese]] language, the progenitor language to the [[Halruaan language]]. It meant \"fool,\" however the meaning of the word was different in the days of the ancient empire. A fool was a counselor and entertainer of kings, an individual who advised their lord through witting satire of song and dance."
