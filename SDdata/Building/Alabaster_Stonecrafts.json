        "mainbody": "'''Alabaster Stonecrafts''' was a stonemason's workshop in the [[Tumbledown]] neighborhood of [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Outer City]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Alabaster Stonecrafts was an open-air workshop with tarps stretched overhead to offer some protection from the elements. The workshop's name was stamped on the tarp, announcing itself to passebys.",
        "History": "The workshop was run by [[dwarf]] twins who went by \"Sister Alabaster\" and \"Brother Alabaster.\" The twins happily whistled as they chiselled at the stone. They enjoyed sniping teasing remarks at each other. On [[Kythorn 28]] of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, Alabaster Stonecrafts was visited by [[Tav]], an adventuring detective who was investigating a series of grizzly murders. One of the dead bodies was fished out of the [[River Chionthar]], wrapped in a tarp taken from one of the workshops on Misty Court. Tav found the open-air stonemason's workshop, and the twins told the investigator of strange happenings that had been plaguing the nearby [[Cliffside Cemetery]], claiming that the gravedigger â€“ [[Grom Skullsmash]], was responsible for the. Or it were the [[ghost]]s if Brother Alabaster was to be believed."
