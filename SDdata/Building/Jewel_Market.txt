The '''Jewel Market''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], was a marketplace dedicated to the buying and selling of [[gemstone]]s and other luxury items.

{{Quote|Chult has a long and storied tradition of [[Wikipedia:lapidary|lapidary]] work.|[[Tearah Initoo]]}}

==Description==
The Jewel Market was described as a smaller and more upscale version of the city's largest marketplace, the [[Grand Souk]]. 

==Services==
While many rare luxury items could be found there, the Jewel Market mainly served as a hub for the trade of the many gems, [[jewel]]s, and [[jewelry]], including both [[precious stones|precious]] and [[semi-precious stones]], mined from the mountains of Chult.{{Cite adventurers league/A Lesson in Love|6}} 

The [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant prince]] [[Zhanthi]] held monopolistic control over the jewel trade in Port Nyanzaru, and thus controlled the Jewel Market. Foreign jewelcrafters interested in selling their wares were directed to the city's [[Tearah Initoo|Master of the Market]].

==Defenses==
The market was patrolled by both guards and undercover agents in the employ of Zhanthi. They were largely effective at deterring [[thieves]] and pickpockets.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Jewel Market was one of the three largest centers of trade in Port Nyanzaru, the others being the Grand Souk and the [[Red Bazaar]].
