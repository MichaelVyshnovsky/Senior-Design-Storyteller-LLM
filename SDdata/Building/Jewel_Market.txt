The Jewel Market of Port Nyanzaru, Chult, was a marketplace dedicated to the buying and selling of gemstones and other luxury items.
The Jewel Market was described as a smaller and more upscale version of the citys largest marketplace, the Grand Souk. 
While many rare luxury items could be found there, the Jewel Market mainly served as a hub for the trade of the many gems, jewels, and jewelry, including both precious and semi-precious stones, mined from the mountains of Chult. 
The merchant prince Zhanthi held monopolistic control over the jewel trade in Port Nyanzaru, and thus controlled the Jewel Market. Foreign jewelcrafters interested in selling their wares were directed to the citys Master of the Market.
The market was patrolled by both guards and undercover agents in the employ of Zhanthi. They were largely effective at deterring thieves and pickpockets.
As of the late 15 century DR, the Jewel Market was one of the three largest centers of trade in Port Nyanzaru, the others being the Grand Souk and the Red Bazaar.
