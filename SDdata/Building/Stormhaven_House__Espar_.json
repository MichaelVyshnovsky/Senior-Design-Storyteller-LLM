        "mainbody": "The '''Stormhaven House''' was a secret training academy for novice [[War Wizards]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The manor stood near Espar, overlooking it from a plateau due north-west. The tranquil woods and meadows nearby were owned by Cormyr, and marked an intersection of the [[King's Forest]] and the foothills of [[Storm Horns]].<ref name=\"GG-04-Stormhaven/>",
        "Location": "A nearby shop, [[Ondrar's Scroll Shop]], provided some resources that would have come in handy to the operations at the manor. Its powerful [[spell|spells]] were bought out by the college, lest they became available to the public.",
        "Defenses": "The manor was fortified with basic protections. Magical ''[[ward]]s'' and powerful creatures provided an additional layer of security.\n\n[[Hippogriff]]s were available to certain War Wizards and court officials.",
        "Training": {
            "Secrets": "Unbeknownst to most, experienced instructors at Stormhaven placed or fortified geas spells on the wizards in training to ensure their allegiance to the Dragon Throne. Vangerdahast had shifted the geas spells' loyalty to himself, but Caladnei had reworked them to ensure loyalty to the Dragon Throne itself - not a specific Monarch or herself.<ref name=\"GG-04-Stormhaven/>"
