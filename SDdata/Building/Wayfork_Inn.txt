The inn's taproom was a large simple square room filled with tables and seating. A single fireplace blazed on the opposite wall from the entrance and to the entrance's left side stood a curved bar stand.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Wayfork Village was raided by the [[Red Fang]] marauder [[goblin]] gang, secretly allied with the [[Zhentarim]]. [[Hobgoblin]] [[Harnak]] the Butcher lead the assault and began slaughtering villages. He took a stand against a group of six adventurers inside the Wayfork Inn, where the scared townsfolk found shelter. Subsequently, the village was saved and Harnak – slain. The innkeeper at the time – [[Larani]], a [[human]] woman, saw present during the attack but survived the experience. Despite the fact that adventurers saved the village, Larani the innkeeper disliked those who took to adventuring, believing them be rough and dangerous, but still welcome at the Wayfork Inn.
