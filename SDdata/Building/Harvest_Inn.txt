The Harvest Inn was an inn located in Westbridge in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The inn was the favorite gathering spot for travelers on the Long Road, which ran between the northern cities of Waterdeep and Mirabar.
The Harvest Inn contained comfortable beds at reasonable prices and it included Derrys Tavern and Eatery, a famous bar wherein travelers exchanged tales every night.
The inns proprietor in the late 15 century DR was the affable halfling Herivin Dardragon, a collector and purveyor of unusual and sometimes distasteful works of art with questionable artistic value.
