        "mainbody": "Trader Fine Furs was one of the largest dealers of furs and pelts within the Dalelands during the mid-14 century DR. This old, family-run business specialized in the pelts of more exotic animals and monsters, and would often hire adventurers to slay specific beasts.\nThey recommended that their contractors kill creatures by means that inflicted as little tissue damage as possible. One such method was the use of the lightning bolt spell."
