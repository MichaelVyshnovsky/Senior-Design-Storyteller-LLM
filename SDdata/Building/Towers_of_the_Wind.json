        "mainbody": "The '''Towers of the Wind''' was a [[wizard]]ing academy that was located in the city of [[Lyrabar]] within the realm of [[Impiltur]]. It was founded by [[Broargar Iringil]], who also served as one of its head instructors. While the Towers of the Wind was described as rather small by [[spellcaster]]s from across [[Faer√ªn]], it was seen as superior to the other magical school of the realm, the [[Moonstone Manse]], which was located in the nearby city of [[Hlammach]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}",
        "Activities": "The school specialized in training the [[mage]]s that served aboard Impilturan merchant-ships, particularly those were assigned to vessels that regularly made the dangerous journeys to [[Sembia]] and the city-states of the [[Moonsea]].\n\nSeveral merchant groups sponsored the education of the towers' mages, including the [[Five Sails]], [[Brass Coffers]] and [[Moonchasers]] consortiums. They were often guaranteed that the school's graduates served about their ships for a full year, in a form of indentured servitude. The novice mages were grateful for the opportunity, as they were well-paid and received invaluable experience for their time at sea."
