'''Glymril Gard''' was a keep somewhere in [[Faerûn]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was held by [[Klanvaerlas Glymril]].

==Location==
The keep was on a ridge overlooking the crossing of two rivers. Six towns were visible from it.

==Structure==
The keep had a number of towers. One of the towers held [[wyvern]]s; another tower, '''Bloodtop Tower''', held prisoners no longer wanted. The tower the Master dwelt in was called the '''Master's Tower'''. A tower at the end of the ridge was almost at the edge, where it became like a cliff. That one was called '''Prow Tower'''.

==Defenses==
The keep had guards; two of them were called [[Curthas]] and [[Halglond]]. Besides the [[spell]]s he could bring to bear, the Master of the tower held a number of wyverns in spell-thrall.

==History==
Glymril Gard had been raised by the spells of [[Klanvaerlas Glymril]], "Master of Wyverns", at some point prior to the {{yearlinkName|764}}. He used his spells to raise a previously dilapidated keep. In the aforementioned year, Glymril Gard was attacked by [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]], who slew Klanvaerlas. The spells he used to raise the keep ended with his death, returning the structure to its previous state and killing at least two of his guards in the process.
