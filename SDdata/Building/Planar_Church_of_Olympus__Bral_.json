        "mainbody": "he Planar Church of Olympus was a temple in the city of Bral, the sole city on the surface of the Rock of Bral, dedicated to the planar church of the same name.\nThis temple was located in the Temple District of the Middle City of Bral, across the road from the Planar Church of the Seven Heavens.\nThe clergy of this temple spent a lot of their time aiding the poor and common folk of Bral. Those who had a patron deity inhabiting Olympus especially received aid.\nIn the 14 century DR, this Bralian sect of the Planar Church of Olympus was rather small, but over time it quickly rose in popularity as piracy and lawless were cracked down upon."
