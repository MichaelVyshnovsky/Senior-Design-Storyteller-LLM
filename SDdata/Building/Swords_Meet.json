The furniture and decorations were quite luxurious but mismatched, giving an impression of a country estate or a royal hunting lodge. The hallways were covered with rugs and tapestries which served to muffle sounds, especially of the staff as they quickly moved about the inn. Each room was accessed through two lockable doors connected by a passage less than a body-length long which gave guests some warning before a chamberservant entered using his or her passkeys. Scented oils were kept burning in hanging lamps to mask any unpleasant odors wafting up from the stables in the basement.\n\nThe common room was decorated with many crossed swords and battered battle trophies.

        "Location": "The Swords Meet faced a northerly direction across [[Shind Road]]. Just to the west was the [[White Stag (building)|White Stag]] on one edge of the Stagfoot&mdash;an arrowhead-shaped median between Shind Road and another road that met at a sharp angle. The tip of this arrowhead pointed directly at the Meet.",
        "Structure": "This imposing inn was built with some elements of a fortress style. The outside walls of this large, square building were made completely from dark-colored stone. Its two stories were taller than normally found in human architecture, making it appear to loom over Shind Road and the surrounding grounds. A steep, rusty metal roof capped it off, complete with crenelated fake parapets and gargoyles at the corners that spat runoff from the roof when it rained.\n\nOn the west side of the inn was a barn and a fenced grazing area used to isolate ill animals from the main stables in the cellar of the larger building.",

        "Services": "Rooms for one or two occupants were 3 [[gp]] per night and 2 gp for each additional person. This price included stabling for mounts, a meal, and a bottomless tankard of ale. Known Zhents were only charged 2 gp per night. Guests were expected to dine in the common room but for 1 [[sp]] they could have drinks or a meal delivered to their room.\n\nSwords Meet was known for its locally brewed dark ale called [[Night ale]]. Other brews could occasionally be found here, but everyone knew that ordering ale meant Night ale. For visitors off the street, ale was 1 sp a tankard. A meal was 8 sp and included all the ale they desired to drink. Wines were priced separately for guests and visitors alike: from 2 sp to 10 gp a flagon, depending on quality and availability. At a minimum, the wine cellar kept in stock the locally produced mead and [[clarry]]; from [[Arabel]], a pleasant [[Arabellan Dry|dry red wine]]; and from [[Saerloon]], their famous [[Saerloonian Glowfire|glowfire]], [[Saerloonian Topaz|topaz]], and [[Saerloonian Special Vat|special vat]] vintages.\n\nThe food at the Meet was plentiful and filling, with common staples dressed up to uncommonly savory heights. At any time of day, [[sausage]] and hot buttered rolls were available to paid guests just for the asking. The sausage was served in chunks on a [[skewer]] in between fried mushrooms. At mealtimes, the kitchen produced a \"remove\"&mdash;a main dish and side items&mdash;served to any table with paying customers. One regularly served remove was seared venison sauteed with mushrooms in red wine, with a plate of [[Askata]] cheese&mdash;a strong, crumbly, yellow cheese imported from [[Impiltur]]&mdash;and biscuits made with sugar and spread with [[blackberry]] jelly, served warm. Another favorite was goat meat roasted to tender perfection and served over fried slices of potato, parsnip, and radish, with a plate of goat cheese sprinkled with crushed almonds, and a fruit mash to finish. A minty hot pepper sauce turned the goat meat into a mouth-watering delicacy. Regular customers were always on the lookout for a rare treat: [[pheasant]] roasted on a spit, served over a plate of [[apple]]s and mushrooms, and a dessert of hearty applecake, sweet, dark and moist.\n\nThe owner of the Meet was [[Aerel Hassammar]] who drove his staff to perform their duties with lightning efficiency while remaining as silent and unseen as possible. He was a fair man, but not above using the threat of beatings and whippings to motivate them. On the other hand, if guests wanted something beyond the normal service, he encouraged his staff to be friendly and he turned a blind eye to most delays caused by guests wanting a more personal touch.",
        "History": "The first owner of the Swords Meet was [[Naskaler Ormith]], a retired Zhentil soldier who desired to create a place for Zhents to feel welcome in an otherwise hostile region south of [[Zhentil Keep]]. He, and perhaps others who followed him, furnished the Meet with purchases of furniture, tapestries, and household items looted from [[Sembian]] mansions and hunting lodges during conflicts with that country to the south. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the owner was Aerel Hassammar.\n\nIn the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Voonlar fell undead a sudden [[fiend]]ish attack by the [[Order of the Crippled Fang]]. As the lower plane denizens started during into the city, Aerel Hassammar barred the doors and windows of his establishment to keep everyone safe. Nevertheless, a [[vrock]] broke through and would've slaughtered everyone inside if it was not for a knight named [[Astar Graysteel]] who unsheathed his sword and calmly cut the creature down.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Gormstadd]], the high priest of the local temple to [[Cyric]], regularly came to the common room with his retinue of lesser priests."
