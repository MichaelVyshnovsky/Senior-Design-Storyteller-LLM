        "Structure": "Emerald Fires was a one-story building of stone and wood in fair condition.",
        "Description": "Emerald Fires was operated by [[Selantha]], a skilled artisan. Since [[1364 DR]], Selantha has managed the business alone following the mysterious disappearance of her husband during a trading mission. She had established a reputation for creating intricate decorative filigree work, particularly on [[armor]]. Her designs, often featuring elegant patterns and fine detailing, cater to those seeking artistry alongside functionality.\n\nWhile her specialty lay in enhancing armor, Selantha also undertook a wide range of projects, crafting items from [[copper]], [[brass]], and [[silver]]. Her work included everything from practical items, such as copper [[pot]]s and [[pan]]s, to ornate silver [[candlestick]]s shaped like fruit trees or branching vines. The cost of her creations ranged from above average to high, while their quality varied from average to good.",
        "Inhabitants": "Among her regular customers was Sergeant [[Belan Kargis]], a well-known local [[mercenary]] who was drawn to her shop through her armor work."
