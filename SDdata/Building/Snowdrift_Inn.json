        "mainbody": "The Snowdrift Inn was an inn in Easthaven within the Ten-Towns of Icewind Dale.\nLocated near Pomabs Emporium in the eastern part of Easthaven, the wooden building looked inviting to many a cold traveler. The inn was surrounded on the outside by racks of drying knucklehead trout, which gave the surrounding area a fishy smell.\nThe one-story inn was a comfortable sight with a warm common room and three rooms where adventurers from the Frozenfar could rest for an evening or two.\nThe Snowdrift was owned by Quimby, who would share tales of Easthaven with newcomers.\nIn Eleint, 1281 DR, an elven wanderer named Erevain Blacksheaf from Evereska stayed at the inn after his travels from Kuldahar in the Spine of the World."
