        "mainbody": "Hired Horrors was a business in Skullport that bred and sold deepspawn.\nThe business was located in the northwest of the Lower Port, on the northeast corner of the Heralds Meet commons. It sat between the Trolls Guffaw theater to its right and Miskers Warehouses to its left and across the street.\nHired Horrors operated out of an unassuming yet large and sturdy two-story converted warehouse that was in good condition as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe inside was divided into two areas. The first was a series of five apartments for the owners, each complete with a study and office. The second was a viewing area for clients. A glassteel wall provided protection to visitors as they observed a portal to the deepspawn breeding pits, through which Hired Horrorss trained deepspawn handlers cajoled and corralled the creatures for viewings.\nHired Horrors bred deepspawn for the purpose of helping interested buyers—generally evil nobles or rulers from anywhere on Toril—to populate dungeons, caverns, cellars, and the like with monsters. Deliveries were usually completed via gates or other forms of teleportation to bring the deepspawn directly to the desired location. Fees were always individually negotiated, but often exceeded 10,000 gold pieces per deepspawn.\nThe business was conceived and founded by four wizards. As he and his old friend Chantos Graybeard made plans to go into business, they were approached by two additional interested investors Ysele the Cat, who staged her own mugging in order to kill her assailants and impress the two and Ithvar Wordkiller, who sought them out more directly. The four soon founded the company and began its breeding program, with Aurin taking control of the business despite the protests of Ithvar, who beleived he deserved to lead as he was the largest investor of the four. The two ultimately decided who would be the boss with a duel that ended in Aurins victory, although he chose to spare Ithvar and keep him on as a business partner.\nThe next step in their operation was to hire adventurers to scout Undermountain for permenant gates through which the deepspwan could be easily moved. With these secured, the business began running smoothly despite a fair amount of animosity between some of the co-founders, all of whom grew quite wealthy over the next two decades.\nThe four wizards briefly brought on a fifth business partner, but he was slain sometime in the 1360s DR when he tried to attack Iljrene Ahbruyn, a local priestess of Eilistraee.\nWhile Aurin was quite proud and satisfied with the companys success, his associates desired more wealth. Ithvar and Ysele actively plotted to undermine him, each angling to usurp control of the company, As of the , Aurin found himself the target of multiple assassination attempts, and although he suspected that one or more of his associates was behind these efforts—most likely Ithvar—he was unable to prove anything.\nIn Alturiak of 1370 DR, Aurin and Chantos were seen acquiring the egg of a white dragon. It was believed that they were planning to use their deepspawn to mass produce these dangerous creatures.\nBy the , Hired Horrors had begun catering to wealthy clients with \"odd tastes.\"\nAs of 1370 DR, the business was run by Aurin the Generous and his assocates close friend Chantos Graybeard, scheming Ysele the Cat, and largest investor Ithvar Wordkiller. All four were accomplished and dangerous wizards. By mid–1372 DR, the business was run by only Aurin, Chantos, and Ithvar.\nThe owners were assisted by a staff of hardened mercenary fighters trained as deepspaen handlers, all of whom wore plate mail and used military forks when interacting with the dangerous merchandise.\nThe deepspawn themselves were not bred within the Hired Horrors shop, but in a secret area beneath the streets of Skullport."
