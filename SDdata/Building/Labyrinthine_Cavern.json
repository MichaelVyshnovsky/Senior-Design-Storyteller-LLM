        "mainbody": "The '''Labyrinthine Cavern''' was a sizable many-leveled underground cave complex in the [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Geography": "[[File:Minotaurs of stormhorns.png|thumb|''One of the minotaurs of the Labyrinthine Cavern underneath the Storm Horns.'']]\nIt was located off the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]], north of [[Skull Crag]] on the western side of the Storm Horn Mountains.",
        "Interior": "The cavern was a well-built subterranean structure of veering and complicated maze-like hallways that surely took years to design and build. The cave opened into a large hallway with a statue of an elfin woman carved of a rock sitting looming over the entryway with her imposing features.\n\nThe upper level of the cave system was the labyrinth of cut stone walls and tunnels. It descended further down into drow caverns and, if ventured into its deepest parts, the cave led to hot lava tubes populated by [[salamander]]s and [[fire elemental]]s.",
        "History": "The Labyrinthine Cavern was built some years before the 1360s [[DR]]. Its tunnels were populated by aggressive [[minotaur]]s, trained [[gorgon]]s, all subservient to a group of [[drow]] [[elves]]. Under the drow command, the labyrinth's minotaurs joined other monstrous inhabitants of the Storm Horns to slay the hero [[Roadwarden]] [[Arelin Starbrow]] and claim one of her [[magic]] ''Arms of the Roadwarden'' for the drow [[sorceress]] commander [[Xelez-Dar]].\n\nSubsequently, a band of adventurers, who earlier defended the [[Skull Crag Keep]] from monstrous incursion, including Xelez-Dar's minotaurs, were sent into the Labyrinthine Cavern by [[Dazmilar Starbrow]], a roguish son of Arelin Starbrow. The adventures were to recover the ''[[Sword]] of the Roadwarden'' from the minotaurs who slew his mother. Eventually, the group came face to face with Xelez-Dar, who ambushed them, dropping from the ceiling in an attempt to slay the invaders. The attack was unsuccessful; Xelez-dar and her drow warriors were defeated."
