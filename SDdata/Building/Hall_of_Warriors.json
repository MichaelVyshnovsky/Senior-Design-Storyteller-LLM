        "mainbody": "The Hall of Warriors was a temple in Luskan dedicated to the worship of Tempus.\nThis temple stood on Aldevers Street, across from the Captains Court.\nThe entrance of this temple was regularly guarded by Luskanite soldiers standing outside of it. Additionally, whenever the city-state went to war its soldiers were forced to march in formation to this temple to make prayer towards Tempus. Though the deity himself was displeased by such enforced worship and thus asked for pricey offerings in return.\nThis temple regularly suffered an occasional burglary, something that was widely rumored among Luskans citizens to be the doings of the local High Captains in an effort to reap back some of their offerings to the temple, which they were said to then offer back to the temple. The wizard Elminster also claimed that these rumors were true."
