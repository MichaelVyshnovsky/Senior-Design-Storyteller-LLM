        "mainbody": "riels School of the Arcane was a school of wizardry in Baldurs Gate on the Sword Coast.\nIt was founded by the Archmage Briel, whod written a letter to the city stating his plan to start a school of wizardry there this was preserved in the citys archive. However, this was done at the guidance of the lich Aumvor the Undying, as part of his plan to revive Netherils spirit of spellcasting, arcane research, and experimentation in Netherese bloodlines, after previous efforts in the Brotherhood of the Black Hand in Ascalhorn and Ulcasters School of Conjuration in Beregost failed spectacularly. The result was Briels School of the Arcane, but it too ultimately failed some time before 1374 DR.Champions of Ruins page 176 says Aumvors plan to create schools of wizardry was \"largely\" a \"spectacular failure\", suggesting Briels School of the Arcane failed somehow, but its actual fate is unknown. No such school has been mentioned in sources on Baldurs Gate."
