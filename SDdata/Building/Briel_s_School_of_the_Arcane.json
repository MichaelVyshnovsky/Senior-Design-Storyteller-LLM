        "mainbody": "'''Briel's School of the Arcane''' was a school of [[wizardry]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] on the [[Sword Coast]].\n\nIt was founded by the Archmage [[Briel]], who'd written a letter to the city stating his plan to start a school of wizardry there; this was preserved in the city's archive. However, this was done at the guidance of the [[lich]] [[Aumvor|Aumvor the Undying]], as part of his plan to revive [[Netheril]]'s spirit of spellcasting, arcane research, and experimentation in [[Netherese]] bloodlines, after previous efforts in the [[Brotherhood of the Black Hand]] in [[Ascalhorn]] and [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry|Ulcaster's School of Conjuration]] in [[Beregost]] failed spectacularly. The result was Briel's School of the Arcane, but it too ultimately failed some time before [[1374 DR]].''Champions of Ruins'' page 176 says Aumvor's plan to create schools of wizardry was \"largely\" a \"spectacular failure\", suggesting Briel's School of the Arcane failed somehow, but its actual fate is unknown. No such school has been mentioned in sources on Baldur's Gate."
