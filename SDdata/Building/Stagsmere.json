        "Structure": "The manor consisted of a central three-story building with east and west wings, both two stories each. By 1374 DR, the upper story of the west wing had mostly collapsed to rubble. The roof was edged with battlements, and a stone stag adorned each corner, in a rearing position. The style of architecture was similar to that of the [[Brossfeather]] villa in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n\nA gravel path led up to the manor, and the entire rear porch was spanned by stone steps. The entry chamber was domed and had a marble floor with a large metal chandelier containing oil lamps. Large marble staircases led to the upper floor on both sides of this room.",
