'''Ramazith's tower''' was a notable landmark in the [[Sword Coast]] city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The [[mage|mage's]] tower was originally built in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the renowned [[sage]] and zoologist, [[Ramazith Flamesinger]]. After the sudden disappearance of Ramazith, a mage named [[Lorroakan]] later obtained ownership of the tower in the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].

==Location==
The tower was located in the [[Temples District]] in the Gate's [[Upper City]].

==Structure==

Built in a distinctive "pagoda"-style, Ramazith's tower was considered an architectural vision or a blemish on the Upper City, depending on who was asked. It was conical in shape, six stories tall with nine roofs that extended outward from peak to base. It was constructed from a remarkable red-hued brick.

==History==
The tower was built by Ramazith, sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. He accomplished this with wealth he had accumulated through unknown means. Soon after, the sage died under mysterious circumstances and his tower was left abandoned.

It remained in this state for nearly over a century, until a few years before the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, when it was purchased by the [[Athkatla]]n [[mage]] [[Lorroakan]].

==Rumors & Legends==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], many rumors circulated that the tower held some long-lost cache of wealth or secret knowledge that had been hidden away by Ramazith.
