        "mainbody": "The '''Library of Ont the Wise''' was a library in the [[T'u Lung]] city of [[Balanzia]], around the {{YearlinkConvert|2310|SY}}, that was either owned by or named for an individual known as Ont the Wise.",
        "Location": "This library was located in the western portion of Balanzia, across from the [[Cotnui Park and Zoo]].",
        "History": "Around {{YearlinkConvert|2403|SY}}, this library was one of many buildings that were left intact in Balanzia as the city fell at the hands of the [[Shou Lung]] invasion of T'u Lung.The Library of Ont the Wise is not explicitly stated in text to have not been destroyed in the incident that destroyed the city. However, on the \"before-and-after\" maps of Balanzia in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' the building is still present on the \"after\" version. Therefore, it can be inferred that it was likely not destroyed. Centuries later, around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, the building that once housed the Library of Ont the Wise still stood within the abandoned city and was recorded as such on a [[map]] made of the city in that year.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Year\" />"
