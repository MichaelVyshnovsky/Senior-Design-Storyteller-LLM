        "mainbody": "The '''House of Cyric''' was a temple dedicated to the [[evil]] [[god]] [[Cyric]] that was located in [[Bezantur]], the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\"",
        "Location": "The House was located in central Bezantur, the capital of the [[tharch]] of [[Priador]] in [[Thay]]. It was surrounded by several other temples, the most prominent of which was [[Loviatar's Manor]]. Other adjacent temples included those dedicated to [[Temple of Oghma (Bezantur)|Oghma]], [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Sune]], [[Temple of Talos (Bezantur)|Talos]], [[Temple of Tempus (Bezantur)|Tempus]], [[Temple of Bane (Bezantur)|Bane]], [[Temple of Beshaba (Bezantur)|Beshaba]], and [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Tyr]].",
        "Structure": "The House of Cyric was a large complex which included multiple shrines and cathedrals to Cyric as well as dormitories, houses, and facilities catering to the many [[priest]]s, visitors, and [[slave]]s based on the campus. Beneath the complex was an extensive dungeon where the Cyricists performed profane rites. A large mansion on-site served as the home of the House's high priest, and was said to be magnificent enough to have been the royal palace of a small kingdom. This mansion included its own secret underground dungeon chamber for the high priest's personal use.",
        "History": "The House was originally a temple to the god of murder, [[Bhaal]]. After that god's death during the [[Time of Troubles]], the temple was converted to worship of the ascended mortal Cyric, who usurped Bhaal's portfolio along with those of [[Myrkul]] and [[Bane]]. Many worshipers at the temple viewed Cyric as a reborn Bhaal, and worshiped him as such.\n\nWith the completion of the [[House of Iyachtu Xvim]] in the late 1360s DR, followers of Cyric began to clash with these upstart followers of [[Iyachtu Xvim]], who saw it as their mission to crush the [[church of Cyric]]. The two temples launched attacks on each other which included assassinations, [[magic]], and street brawling, often clashing with the city's authorities as well.\n\nEven as Cyric progressively lost influence to rival gods throughout the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he maintained a strong following in Thay, and the congregation at the House of Cyric remained the largest in the realm.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "As a prominent center of Cyric's worship, the temple likely played host to at least one [[banelar naga]] in the years following the death of Bane in the Time of Troubles.",
        "Inhabitants": "The House of Cyric was home to an army of priests and priestesses of Cyric along with their unwilling servants: hundreds of slaves as well as the risen [[zombies]] of their former prisoners sacrificed within the dungeons.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the high priest was [[Sharthane Zul]]."
