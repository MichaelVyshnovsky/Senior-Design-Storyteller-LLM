The Fane of Lolth was a underground temple dedicated to the Queen of Spiders located beneath Roth√© Valley on the Sword Coast North.
It could be found in the depths beneath Toril known as the Edge of the Underdark, the passageways and caves that were situated above the Northdark.
The simple temple comprised a stone-floored hall with a vaulted ceiling, branching off from drow-dug tunnels and subterranean outposts.
On either side of the temples walls were a series of stone statues that each depicted the likeness of a drow priestess carrying a staff in one hand, as her other was set forward as if to receive an item. Six lit braziers were set between the statues, five of which held blue flames while the sixth contained natural, orange-red fire.
At the head of the temple was a simple shrine that comprised three more statues of drow priestesses, each facing what appeared to be a sacrificial altar. The shrine was set within an ominous-looking piece of drow metalwork that took the form of man-sized pincers adorned with engravings and gems of violet hue.
The temple was a place of worship where drow could properly pay tribute to the Spider-Queen Lolth. It also housed at least one history book that outlined the ancient history of the Araushnee-worshiping "dhaerow", previously known as the Ilythiiri, including their exile to the Underdark.
The temple was raided in the , by the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge as they carried out their execution of Prince SarkonIss.
