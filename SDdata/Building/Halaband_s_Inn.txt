Halabands Inn was a small inn and tavern found in the town of Immersea in Cormyr.
The inn was a dark and drafty establishment decorated with fine wood paneling.
Halabands Inn was known to have a wider menu selection compared to the local competition. Bells were used to announce the arrival of food as well as to scare off the occasional bat that clung to the dumbwaiter used to deliver food.
Halabands Inn was originally built by an adventurer to use as a base of operations.
