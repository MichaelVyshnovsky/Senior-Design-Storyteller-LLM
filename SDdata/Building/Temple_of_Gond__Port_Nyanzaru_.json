        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Gond''' in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], was a place of worship dedicated to [[Gond]], worshiped as the [[god]] of crafting.",
        "Location": "The temple lay in Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]] between the eastern foot of [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]] and the [[Royal Docks (Port Nyanzaru)|Royal Docks]].",
        "Structure": "It was a boxy structure of stone. In place of a traditional [[forge]], the temple had an immense [[fountain]] as its centerpiece. This fountain took advantage of Port Nyanzaru's naturally high water pressure passing through [[nozzle]]s and [[valve]]s to create jets of water that constantly shifted and formed intricate shapes.",
        "History": "In the century following the disappearance of [[Ubtao]], Gond became one of the more popular [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian gods]] among the people of Port Nyanzaru, notably its many [[artisan]]s, [[craftspeople]], hydro-[[engineer]]s, [[ivory]] carvers, and [[smith]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city, owing to a history of exploitation, and so the [[Church of Gond|Gondar]] [[priest]]hood had came to be composed of native [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]]."
