        "mainbody": "The '''Silversgate''' was an archway ''[[portal]]'' in [[Myth Drannor]] that connected the city to the [[High Forest]] region of [[the North]].",
        "Location": "It was located on [[Kurvhan's Way]], in the [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Old City]] district of Myth Drannor.",
        "Structure": "The gate was a tall archway made of stone and [[silver]].",
        "Activities": "The ''portal'' transported anyone who passed through the archway to the [[Silverymoon Pass]]. It originally opened up directly to the city of [[Ascalhorn]], but the destination was changed to allow easier access to [[Silverymoon]] itself.\n\nIt was guarded at all hours by members of the [[Coronal Guard]] to regulate passage and ensure nothing dangerous came through the other side."
