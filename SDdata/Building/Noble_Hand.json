However, the Helmites and their cargo never arrived.\nAround 1368 DR, Noble Hand was led by High Watchful Weaponmaster Ellym \"Catsjaw\" Thourin. It thrived under Ellyms leadership.\nNoble Hand was considered to be not only one of the five major temples of Helm in the Vast in the 14 century DR, it was considered the most prominent temple of Helm in all the Realms."
