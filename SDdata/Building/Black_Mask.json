        "mainbody": "The '''Black Mask''' was a tavern that operated in [[Arabel]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was considered among the most popular establishments in the city.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a [[mage]] created a bright sphere of light in front of the black mask and inadvertently trapped himself within. Business at the tavern soared over the course of the following week as other mages tried to free the trapped individual and onlookers came to gawk at the disturbing incident. The poor trapped mage died of thirst at the end of that week's time."
