The center square had a single rainwater barrel, and all walls were covered in climbing plants and flower-filled hanging baskets, typical for the city of Arrabar.\nCirca the , Neelys Cheese employed a young commoner woman named Mirolyn Skolotti. In 1373 DR, her sister was murdered by supposed members of the Municipal Guard of Arrabar who claimed she was falsely advertising herself as a wizard via forehead markings. The deed was witnessed by Vambran Matrell of the Order of the Sapphire Crescent who took it upon himself to investigate the injustice. When Vambran tracked the killed womans family, Mirolyn and her aging blind mother Nimra Skolotti, they agreed to be interviewed by the young noble in the privacy of Neelys Cheeses patio, away from prying eyes."
