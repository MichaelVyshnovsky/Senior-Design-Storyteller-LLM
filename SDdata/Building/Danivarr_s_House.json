        "mainbody": "'''Danivarr's House''' was a high-class inn in [[Everlund]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} and late-15{{th}} century [[DR]] and was one of the oldest inns in the city.",
        "Structure": "Formerly a mansion, Danivarr's was one of the largest inns in all of Everlund. It was connected to an adjacent mansion by several rickety, covered, flying bridges.",
        "History": "Prior to becoming an inn, Danivarr's House was some noble's mansion.\n\nSome time after [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the inn was bought by the [[Zoar]] family, but they left a one-eyed [[half-orc]] named [[Dral Thelev]] to run the business.\n\nAround this same time, both the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Harpers]] were known to be keeping a close eye on the establishment.",
        "Inhabitants": "The clientele of the inn was typically known to include royalty, adventurers, and people who were convinced that they were nobility whether it be due to delusions of grandeur or archaic titles."
