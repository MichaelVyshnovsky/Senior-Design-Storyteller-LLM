The fortress occupied a brief expanse of land in far southern reaches of the desert of the [[Haunted Lands]] that was sandwiched between the mountains and the jungles of the Cities of the Ancients. It was approximately {{SI|45|mi|k}} west of the [[Nogaro River]].

==Activities==
Historically, the fortress was a strategic location to guard against any attackers skirting Al-Sayaj Mountains into the Cities of the Ancients. It was unoccupied as of 1367 DR.
