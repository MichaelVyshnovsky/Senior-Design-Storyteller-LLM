Gurneths Goblet was an expensive high-end eatery located in the Tentowers neighborhood of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
Gurneths Goblet was one of the most popular establishments across all of Tentowers. The restaurant filled out three full stories of its building with the interior lavishly decorated with expensive red carpets, tapestries woven by gnomes, arched ceilings, and decorative ironworks.
Gurneths Goblet stood on the southeastern side of the crossing of Bouldergrinders Way and Fireleap Lane in the Uptown Districts Tentowers neighborhood.
Despite its appearance, Gurneths Goblet was an informal restaurant that encouraged a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, allowing guests plenty of space apart and privacy. The eatery offered fanciful dining and prided itself on its full wine cellars, including the clear and cool house wine made at Gurneths Goblet and served in jumbo-sized goblets. The kitchens provided the guests with sophisticated dishes like a variety of robust roasts, smoked goose in a sauce of leeks, various curries, sausages, and shrimp cooked in ginger paste.
The Goblet was run by Turad Gurneth in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
