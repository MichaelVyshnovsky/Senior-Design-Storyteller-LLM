Haven Towers was the seat of civic power of Tarmalune, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond.
Haven Towers was the place were members of the Council of Tarmalune met every seven days to discuss the city policies and laws, and to proclaim their verdicts in legal matters.
Members of the staff were known as "Haveners", and were mostly females. They were very competent and worked directly under the command of the Lord Speaker of the Council. The "Haveners" were charged to report to the Vigilant or to the Lord Speaker himself every suspicious movement made by members of the Council and other city clerks, allowing the Lord Speaker to maintain corruption levels as low as possible.
The inspectors of the ports of Tarmalune, known as "ravens", were also part of the staff of Haven Towers. The job of the "ravens" was to collect taxes from the ships docked in the ports.
