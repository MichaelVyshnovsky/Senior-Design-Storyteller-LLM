        "mainbody": "Haffas Flatbacks was a courier service in the Lower Port of Skullport in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nHaffas Flatbacks was a one-story establishment in fair condition.\nHaffas Flatbacks addressed the high demand for unskilled labor in Skullport’s bustling port. Given the daily movement of vast quantities of goods, necromancers like Mhaug could not animate enough zombies to meet the need. Haffa, a half-ogre, recognized an opportunity and purchased a large group of goblins from Malakuth Tabuirrs slavers.\nAs a result, Haffas goblin and kobold teamsters were a common sight across the Lower Port and Trade Lanes around 1370 DR, carrying parcels and hauling freight for any paying customer. They utilized rudimentary wheelbarrows to manage loads exceeding . Haffas rates were approximately 1 silver piece per goblin or kobold per quarter hour. Each worker was equipped with a small hourglass that marked 15-minute intervals, ensuring accurate billing.\nHaffa was known for his fierce loyalty to his workforce. Haffa freed the goblins under the condition that they remained employed by him for fair wages—a proposition few refused, as those who attempted to leave were swiftly dealt with by Haffa himself.\nAnyone who inflicted unjust harm upon his teamsters faced retaliation from a group of over 100 goblins and kobolds, whom Haffa could assemble in under an hour if necessary. To deter theft, any worker caught pilfering goods or holding back fares met a swift and harsh punishment—their remains were displayed prominently on the eaves outside Haffas Flatbacks as a stark reminder of his limited tolerance for dishonesty."
