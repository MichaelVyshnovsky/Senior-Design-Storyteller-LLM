        "mainbody": "'''Haffa's Flatbacks''' was a courier service in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "Haffa's Flatbacks was a one-story establishment in fair condition.",
        "Services": "Haffa's Flatbacks addressed the high demand for unskilled labor in Skullport’s bustling port. Given the daily movement of vast quantities of goods, [[necromancer]]s like [[Mhaug]] could not animate enough [[zombie]]s to meet the need. Haffa, a [[half-ogre]], recognized an opportunity and purchased a large group of [[goblin]]s from [[Malakuth Tabuirr]]'s slavers.\n\nAs a result, Haffa's goblin and [[kobold]] teamsters were a common sight across the Lower Port and [[Skullport/Trade Lanes|Trade Lanes]] around [[1370 DR]], carrying parcels and hauling freight for any paying customer. They utilized rudimentary [[wheelbarrow]]s to manage loads exceeding {{SI|100|lb|k|long=yes}}. Haffa's rates were approximately 1 [[silver piece]] per goblin or kobold per quarter hour. Each worker was equipped with a small [[hourglass]] that marked 15-minute intervals, ensuring accurate billing.",
        "Inhabitants": "Haffa was known for his fierce loyalty to his workforce. Haffa freed the goblins under the condition that they remained employed by him for fair wages—a proposition few refused, as those who attempted to leave were swiftly dealt with by Haffa himself.\n\nAnyone who inflicted unjust harm upon his teamsters faced retaliation from a group of over 100 goblins and kobolds, whom Haffa could assemble in under an hour if necessary. To deter theft, any worker caught pilfering goods or holding back fares met a swift and harsh punishment—their remains were displayed prominently on the eaves outside Haffa's Flatbacks as a stark reminder of his limited tolerance for dishonesty."
