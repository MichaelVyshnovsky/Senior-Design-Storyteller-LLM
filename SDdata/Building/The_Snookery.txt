'''The Snookery''' was a rather old building in the city of [[Waterdeep]],

==Location==
This home was located along [[Spindle Street]], in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of Waterdeep since before [[1357 DR]].

==Structure==
The Snookery stood two stories tall. Its walls were made of stone and its windows were barred. Its exterior doors were covered in the plating of old [[plate armor|armor]], hammered flat. Atop the roof of the building were its eponymous "snooks"&mdash;intelligent, animated stone statues similar in nature to a [[gargoyle]], but carved to resemble a [[griffon]]&mdash;who acted as the building's guardians, circa [[1372 DR]]. The "snooks" were unshakably loyal to Myrmith and even magic could not turn them against him.
==Interior==
Inside of the building was equipment for modifying or repairing weapons, which often gave it a muted din similar to the sounds of a foundry. The home also had on public display a large variety of weaponry of all sorts, collected by Myrmith, for daily use.

==Services==
Beyond being his place of residence, Myrmith Splendon used the Snookery as a space to instruct and train his clients in the ways of [[Fighter|fighting]] with weaponry of all sorts. The intensive training would ensure a certain level of weapon expertise improvement. He charged an advanced, steep fee for these services. The fee was 190 [[gold piece]]s per week, multiplied by the client's level of expertise. If a client wanted to "bump" themselves up the wait list, he or she had to pay double the asking fee.

==Defenses==
Besides the building's "snooks", which were constantly being experimented and improved upon by Myrmith's [[wizard]] friends, the Snookery was protected against robbers by seven magical ''+2 [[flying dagger]]s''. These daggers could not be affected by any type of [[magical]] or [[psionic]] control except by Myrmith, and they were immune to ''[[magic missile]]'' and all [[:Category:Lightning spells|lightning]] or [[:Category:Electricity spells|electrical]]-based magic, which they would reflect back at the caster with full force.
