        "mainbody": "he Skys Mantle was a prestigious tavern in the Stiltways of Yhaunn.\nThe tavern was located atop the fifth level of the Stiltways, on the southern side of the district.\nThe Mantle was a quality tavern that catered to the wealthy socialites of Yhaunn. As it was built on the rooftop terraces of the district, patrons could enjoy a cool breeze and clear moonlight, a rarity in the crowded and built-up city. \nBecause the Stiltways were considered extremely dangerous at night, the Mantle appealed to those with a sense of daring, even though it was completely safe atop the fifth level.\nIn 1373 DR, the dissolute duelist Keph Thingoleir repeatedly encountered his rival Lyraene at the Mantle, and they instigated fights with each other."
