        "Location": "The tavern was located atop the fifth level of the Stiltways, on the southern side of the district.",
        "Description": "The Mantle was a quality tavern that catered to the wealthy socialites of Yhaunn. As it was built on the rooftop terraces of the district, patrons could enjoy a cool breeze and clear moonlight, a rarity in the crowded and built-up city. \n\nBecause the Stiltways were considered extremely dangerous at night, the Mantle appealed to those with a sense of daring, even though it was completely safe atop the fifth level.",
        "History": "In [[1373 DR]], the dissolute duelist [[Keph Thingoleir]] repeatedly encountered his rival [[Lyraene]] at the Mantle, and they instigated fights with each other."
