'''Ilmater's Safe Harbor''' was a soup kitchen, run by the [[Ilmatari]] [[priest]]ess [[Brenia|Mother Brenia]], in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was known to be frequented by almost every beggar in that ward.

==Interior==
The building's layout consisted of a cooking area, a dining room, a small room in the back, and a cellar.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|11}} These rooms were provided illumination by means of [[lantern]]s and a heavy, [[iron]] chandelier of [[candle]]s.

Within the building's cellar was a hidden door, which opened to rough-hewn rock tunnels leading into the [[Warrens]].

==Services==
Being a soup kitchen, this establishment provided free meals for the impoverished citizens of the Dock Ward. Additionally, in the building's small back room, Mother Brenia tended to the sick.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|8,10-11}}

==Inhabitants==
In addition to Mother Brenia, the soup kitchen was run by a number of volunteers,{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|10}} Some of the known volunteers included [[Niela Snowdrop]], [[Rik Milsean]], and [[Ulmani]].

==History==
At some point during the late 15{{th}} century DR there was a string of disappearances of both beggars {{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|6}} and stray [[dog]]s in the Dock Ward.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|9}} This began not long after Ulmani, Rik Milesan, and some others began volunteering at the soup kitchen.

A month later, the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watchman]] [[Girnan Svann]] found himself frustrated at his superiors' not viewing the string of disappearances as something worth looking into. He went on to hire a group of [[adventurer]]s at the [[Blue Mermaid]] to investigate, informing them that each missing beggar was connected to Ilmater's Safe Harbor, but that it could be a false lead.

Looking around the establishment, the adventurers eventually discovered its hidden cellar door.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|12}} After beating up the thugs, the adventurers recognized some of them as the newer volunteers and that their Sharran identities were merely a red herring to distract from the mysterious [[mage]] they were truly kidnapping people for.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Missing and the Missed|18-19}}
