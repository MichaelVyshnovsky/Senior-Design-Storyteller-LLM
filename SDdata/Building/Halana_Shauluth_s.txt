Halana Shauluths was a bakery in Amphail, run by a former adventurer who lost her hand in battle and sought retirement during the mid-14 century DR. 
Halana sold dark, hardwheat loaves for 2 cp apiece. They were perfect sustenance for adventuring types as they held up well during travel. She also offered small buns, whose centers were filled with chopped-meat stew for 4 cp each, or 3-for-1 sp.
