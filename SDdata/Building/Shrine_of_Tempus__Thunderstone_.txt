The '''shrine of Tempus''' in the town of [[Thunderstone]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 1360s [[DR]] was dedicated to [[Tempus]], god of battle. 

It was tended by Battle Chaplain [[Saerlia Ashley]]. She inspired attending adventurers and [[Purple Dragons]] soldiers with sermons of battle, blood, and fire. She offered her healing only to those wounded in battle, and would confirm the truth of a tale before she started.

The shrine was a stone building decorated all over with the detritus of war: split helms, broken shields, blood-stained armor, shattered swords, and the skulls of the fallen.
