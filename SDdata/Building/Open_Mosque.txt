The '''Open Mosque''' was a temple devoted to the [[Zakharan pantheon]] located in [[Qudra]] in [[north Zakhara]].

The blue tiles of the Open Mosque stood out in stark contrast to the muted grays seen throughout the city. The mosque attracted worshipers within Qudra who were not devoted to [[Vataqatal]].

==History==
In honor of the valiant service of the [[mamluk]]s. the eighth [[Grand Caliph]] of [[Zakhara]] sent his finest architects and engineers to Qudra to construct a mosque as their reward.
