Beehive Goods and Wares was located in a small two-storied building somewhere roughly the southeast of [[The Blushing Mermaid]] in the Lower City and just south of the [[Crimson Draughts]] shoppe. The shop's entrances were located under an arch formed by the building's second floor that stretched north over the street to another exit located on the second floor, used by the Tefoco and living quarters. The sign that hung above the entrance depicted a [[bee]]hive surrounded by [[bottle]]s of [[wine]] and crates. The shop itself was on the building's first floor, with the room filled with cupboards and shelves of goods that included food, [[potion]]s, wines, and some general miscellany.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Beehive Goods and Wares was run by [[Oliver Tefoco]] and was home to his spouse [[Kroyce Tefoco]] and two youngest children–[[Hemjax Tefoco|Hemjax]] and [[Maggie Tefoco|Maggie]]. The family's older children lived in other parts of the city and traveled with merchant caravans along the [[Sword Coast North]]. When the cultist army of [[The Absolute]] targeted the Gate and began a march to attack it, Beehive Goods and Wares became the home to Oliver only as he sent his spouse and children to their family in [[Beregost]], out of harm's way. Beehive remained abuzz with business through the tumult of the coming war. During that time, [[Notale's Hostel]] that sheltered refugees, asked Oliver Tefoco for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Wares's own supplier–[[Durinbold & Oathoon]], Provisoners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate.
