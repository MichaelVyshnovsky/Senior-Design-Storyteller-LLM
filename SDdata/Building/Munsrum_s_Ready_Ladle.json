        "mainbody": "'''Munsrum's Ready Ladle''' was a busy and popular blurdren (food counter with very limited seating) located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76-77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}",
        "Location": "The building that housed Munsrum's was the northern-most construction on the east side of [[North Way]] before reaching the east tower of [[Turthtraal]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|73}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 57: Khôltar, Part 8, A First Look at Handrornlar}} Munsrum's was separated from the guard tower by an alley that connected to the nameless track that serviced all the [[catapult]] towers around the inner wall. Next to Munsrum's, to the south, was [[Oraundro Nempeth's]] [[rope]] and [[wire]] shop and then [[Harhallo's Warmhearth House]]. On the blunted prow of the intersection of North Way with [[Orntathtar Way]], roughly southwest of Munsrum's, was [[Jamrado's Thanetalium]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|78}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 60: Khôltar, Part 11, A Last Look Around Handrornlar}}",
        "Structure": "Munsrum's Ready Ladle was an old, relatively small tower with broken turrets and other structural problems whose temporary patches appeared to have become permanent. There were additions to the building that didn't match the original style. Food was served through walk-up windows.",
        "Services": "{{Fq|float=right|text='Tis about as good as an Iron City blurdren gets.|source=[[Elminster]]|width=220px}}\nThe menu at Munsrum's was short and rarely changed, but was available around the clock. There were three entrées, each served in a hardrusk [[bread]] [[bowl]] (baked with a hard crust, flat bottom, and large cavity): an [[egg]]-based dish called [[mantara]] was an [[omelet]] of [[cheese]]s and leafy greens; a [[salted fish]] casserole called [[claevur]] was made with tubers, greens, and grubs; and [[thimmer]] was a [[gravy]]-covered hash of pan-fried [[boar]] and other meats, plus [[sausage]].  A serving of claevur was 2 [[sp]], while mantara and thimmer were 3 sp each.\n\nUnless the customer brought his or her own vessel, all non-bottled drinks at Munsrum's had a 1 [[cp]] surcharge for the dented metal [[cup]] in which the drink was served. The staff didn't care if the cups were returned, but most people brought it back with them on their next visit to save a copper piece. Hot [[vauge]] tea was free. [[Ale]] was 4 cp per cup for the house blend of whatever cheap [[keg]]s came in from traveling merchants, so the quality varied from poor to adequate. The servers would fill a small [[tankard]] for this price, but largers tankards were charged more. Bottled [[cordial]]s were available for 3 to 6 [[gp]] depending on popularity and seasonal availability. These cordials were made of [[berry]] juice or [[fruit]] juice with a measure of fiery [[wine]] and a secret [[herb]]al mixture added, allowing the staff to promote them as having beneficial medicinal effects as well as great taste. The least expensive cordial was the yellow-orange [[muquet]], and the most expensive was the dark blue [[thannaberry]].",
        "Atmosphere": "This blurdren was popular with all races found in the Iron City. Even some [[dwarves]] who could walk a few steps to [[Taurgaur's Tarjteir]] and [[Phlambror's]] were seen queuing up at Munsrum's windows. This was partially attributed to the good food served quickly for a reasonable price, but it was also because the servers were all good-humored, saucy-tongued women (including three [[half-elves]], a race rarely seen in Khôltar) that bantered with the customers through the windows and gained a broad spectrum of admirers. The kitchen was always brightly lit and noisy with food preparation and chatter among the staff."
