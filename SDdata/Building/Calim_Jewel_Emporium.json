        "mainbody": "The '''Calim Jewel Emporium''' was a jeweler's shop located in [[Little Calimshan]] within the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "Services": "In addition to being the home to perhaps the most well-regarded Baldurian jeweler of the late 15{{th}} century, the emporium served as a forum for local agents of criminal organization known as [[the Guild]]. The emporium was owned by the Guild [[Kingpin]] of Little Calimshan, [[Rilsa Rael]]. She used her establishment as a headquarters for guild members and to host public events for the people of her neighborhood and the rest of the Outer City.\n\nIn addition to its civic-and-criminal-oriented activities, the emporium functioned as any other jeweler's business â€” with the distinction of having sterling reputation. Its lapidary was among the Gate's finest and it was considered one of the best places to sell stolen gems and jewels."
