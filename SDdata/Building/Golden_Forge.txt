The '''Golden Forge''' was a secret temple dedicated to [[Geb]], the Father Under the Skies and Sands within the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]].

==Location==
The Golden Forge was located within a volcano on the island known as the [[Ship of the Gods]] in the [[Alamber Sea]]. Only Geb's most faithful followers knew the location of this temple.

==Activities==
Geb's clergy within the Golden Forge spent the vast majority of their time attempting to stop the volcano from erupting, as it threatened to do since the [[Time of Troubles]]. Unbeknownst to the outside world, Geb's clergy saved the coasts of [[Unther]] from being buried by ash had the volcano erupted.
