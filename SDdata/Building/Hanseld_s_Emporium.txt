Hanselds Emporium was a trading company headquartered in Highmoon within Deepingdale during the late 14 century DR. Travelers from all over Faer√ªn came to browse Hanselds wares, which included exotic spices, finished goods and curious items from Selgaunt and Marsember.
Hanseld also ran a smuggling and fencing operation out of his shop and would arrange for the transference of stolen goods.
