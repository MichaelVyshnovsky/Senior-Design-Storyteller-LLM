'''Hanseld's Emporium''' was a trading company headquartered in [[Highmoon]] within [[Deepingdale]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Travelers from all over [[Faer√ªn]] came to browse [[Hanseld]]'s wares, which included exotic [[spices]], finished goods and curious items from [[Selgaunt]] and [[Marsember]].

Hanseld also ran a smuggling and fencing operation out of his shop and would arrange for the transference of stolen goods.
