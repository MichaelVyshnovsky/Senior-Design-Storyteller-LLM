The Rutting Buck was a tavern in Leilon.
The Rutting Buck, which was located in the middle of Leilon, was seemingly always full of activity. The bustling tavern played loud music, and the patrons themselves were rowdy.
In 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore arrived at the tavern to escort a group of ambassadors to Waterdeep. They were greeted by a soldier, who appeared to be Waterdhavian, and he announced their arrival to the patrons. After a while, the heroes and guards sat down to eat a meal of venison and hot bread. However, the food was drugged, and the heroes were captured and imprisoned.
