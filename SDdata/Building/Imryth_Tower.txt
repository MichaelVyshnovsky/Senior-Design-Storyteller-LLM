Imryth Tower was the home and place of business of the cleric Audara Imryth in the city of Westgate in 1367 DR.
The tower was located at the end of Twoturrets Lane in the southwest section of the city.
Audara sold potions from her tower, but this was just a front to keep her role as a Harper agent a secret.
