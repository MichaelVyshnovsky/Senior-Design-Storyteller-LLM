        "mainbody": "Satyrdance Pool was a pond in Myth Drannor, a possession of the Tornglara family, and a socializing spot for the matriarchs of several houses as of the mid-to-early 3 century DR.\nThe pool was located in a private garden, behind House Tornglara.\nSatyrdance was the \"wannest\" of several pools. It had a wooden path leading up to it. An oval mirror hung from a shadowtop tree close to the pool, and many branches were low enough to hang clothes from.\nEvery fourth day after highsunfeast, the ladies of several houses met there as of 241 DR. The pool was spiced with rosewater for such occasions, and refreshments were served.\nIn the , a meeting hosted by Alaglossa Tornglara, and attended by Ithrythra Mornmist, Duilya Evendusk, and Cilivren Doedance resulted in the four ladies agreeing they expected Elminster, a human, being given the honor of being named armathor would result in the eventual assassination of the Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, with the ensuing succession fight causing extreme damage. In light of this eventuality, they made a vague resolution to try and prevent Cormanthor from coming apart in spite of the human being named an armathor.\nIt was said that the Tornglara ladies used a mirror by the pool to scry into human cities for fashions they might want to copy."
