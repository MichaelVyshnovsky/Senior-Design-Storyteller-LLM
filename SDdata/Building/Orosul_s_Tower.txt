'''Orosul's Tower''' was a small tower located in the city of [[Archenbridge]] in [[Archendale]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Though the place was abandoned by [[Orosul]] in the 1350s [[DR]], no [[Arkhenfolk]] stepped foot inside ever since as the powerful [[mage]] promised that "doom would befall intruders and fair Archendale both."

==Location==
[[File:Orosul's tower.png|thumb|right|150px|''A mage in front of Orosul's tower.'']]
The inn was located on the intersection between [[Drover's Lane]] and [[Spindral Street]], in the southern part of the city.

==Structure==
The tower was slender and measured {{SI|60|feet|long=yes}} high. Made of [[granite]], it stood in the center of a walled garden closed by two locked iron gates. Although the general belief was that only Orosul possessed the key to its tower, in reality [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]] and [[Cylyria Dragonbreast]] had spares as well.

By [[1370 DR]], the unattended garden grew thick with vines creeping up the tower's sides. The garden was home of numerous small animals such as [[bird]]s, [[rabbit]]s and [[squirrel]]s, but no larger beasts were ever witnessed there.

It was unclear whether the tower had three or four floors, as it was dotted by shuttered windows in a seemingly random pattern..

==Defenses==
The city assigned ten soldiers to keep watch around the tower at all times. Equipped with [[chainmail]]s, [[sling]]s, blunt-padded [[arrow]]s and [[net]]s, their role was to prevent anyone from casting [[spell]]s or using [[magic item]]s within sight of the tower.

==History==
Coming from [[Sembia]], the mage Orosul used magic to identify the [[Swords of Archendale]]. He made a deal with them that supposedly involved a large sum of money, in exchange for which he would be free to settle in town and do as he pleased without being controlled or watched.

''Circa'' [[1350 DR]], the mage disappeared from the tower after warning the Swords against anyone entering his abode, promising a terrible doom should this rule be broken.

==Rumors & Legends==
===Successful Adventurers===
Although nobody has officially entered the tower since Orosul's disappearance, there were persistent rumors in the [[Dales]] that this or that [[adventurer]]-mage had.

===Scary Stories===
Archenfolks, who were known for their dislike of strangers, liked to scare visitors by telling them to look at the tower to see what happened to even well-meaning outlanders who settled in the town.

This practice gave birth to a local idiom, "It is deep in Orosul's Tower," which meant 'It is where you will never find it'.

===Floating Bed===
The few reliable tidbits of information regarding the interior of the tower were revealed by Orosul's apprentice. She let it be known that the mage possessed a large circular magical floating bed in its lofty chambers, a rumor heartily repeated by a local carpenter.

According to her, the bed was surrounded by a cloud of magical darkness filled with twinkling illusory stars at night, and could split apart to reveal a treasure of money and magical items hidden in an extra-dimensional space "under" it.

===Ancient Power Scepter===
Also according to Orosul's apprentice, one half of a powerful magical [[Orosul's scepter|Netherese power scepter]] was hidden under a cobblestone within sight of the tower.

==Inhabitants==
* [[Orosul]]: A powerful mage and the proprietor of the tower.
* [[Felsharra of the Four Winds]]: Orosul's apprentice.
