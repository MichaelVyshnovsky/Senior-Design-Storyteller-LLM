The '''Counting House''' was the center of trade and business in [[Baldur's Gate]], serving as both a bank and establishment that facilitated the exchange of various currencies.

It was located on the waterfront of [[The Steeps]], overlooking [[Gray Harbor]].

==Description==
The Counting House was a fortress-like building with dense walls. Its top two floors were entirely windowless.

The seemingly impenetrable structure descended deep beneath the streets of Baldur's Gate. Its subterranean, cylindrical floors served as vaults that stored the shared wealth of many Baldurian [[patriar]] families. [[Stone golem]]s served as sentries
and guardians for these riches, patrolling the Counting House's deepest corridors.

==History==
The counting house was founded by Magnate [[Carric Ilphescient]] of Baldur's Gate and soon after the bank became one of the major contributors to the Gate's economic successes. The Counting House earned a number of wealthy patrons and supporters over the years with the most loyal among them earning a special place among the bank's ''Record of the Honored.'' It included the [[Shattershield]] family whose money allowed the bank to upgrade its vaults; Lady [[Isabella Bormul]], who donated seven carts of [[Amn]]ian [[silver]]; Grand Dukes [[Abdel Adrian]], [[Liia Jannath]], and [[Belt (human)|Belt]], for their contributions following the [[Iron crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, as well as Lord [[Daryn Silvershield]], whose generous donation was so impressive, it too the bank a [[tenday]] to count.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Counting House commissioned expensive repairs to the bank's vaults and the mechanical systems after the sublevels were flooded due to regular earthquakes caused by the [[Netherbrain]] hidden underneath the city. The repair included draining seawater and reinforcing the sublevel walls, however, [[Gondian Guild]] was to be contacted for any magical defenses repair. The physical repair was a hefty sum, and Gondian repairs would cost even more, especially if the damage were to be repeated.
