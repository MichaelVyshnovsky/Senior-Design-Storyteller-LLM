        "mainbody": "The Old Codpiece Arms & Armory was a shop in Jesters Green that bought and sold second-hand weapons and armor. It was named for the threateningly large feature on an old, stout suit of armor that was reputed to have been worn by King Dhalmass Obarskyr, but was more likely worn by a subject baron called the Old Boar.\nThe shop bought used items at half-price or less, depending on the condition it arrived in. It was then turned around and sold at two-thirds or three-quarters the price of a new item. A wide variety of weapons and armor could be found there, and thieves were warned that animated flying daggers and battle horrors lurked among the merchandise.\nThe shops staff was made up of three old dwarves and seven retired Purple Dragons, all able and willing to throw nearby weapons at shoplifters. They were quite loyal to Cormyr and reported any suspicious behaviour or talk in their shop to the War Wizards."
