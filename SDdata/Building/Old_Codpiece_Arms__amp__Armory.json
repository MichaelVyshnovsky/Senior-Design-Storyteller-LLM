        "mainbody": "'''The Old Codpiece Arms & Armory''' was a shop in [[Jester's Green]] that bought and sold second-hand weapons and armor. It was named for the threateningly large feature on an old, stout suit of armor that was reputed to have been worn by King [[Dhalmass Obarskyr]], but was more likely worn by a subject baron called the Old Boar.",
        "Services": "The shop bought used items at half-price or less, depending on the condition it arrived in. It was then turned around and sold at two-thirds or three-quarters the price of a new item. A wide variety of weapons and armor could be found there, and thieves were warned that animated ''[[flying dagger]]s'' and ''[[battle horror]]s'' lurked among the merchandise.\n\nThe shop's staff was made up of three old [[dwarves]] and seven retired [[Purple Dragons]], all able and willing to throw nearby weapons at shoplifters. They were quite loyal to Cormyr and reported any suspicious behaviour or talk in their shop to the [[War Wizards]]."
