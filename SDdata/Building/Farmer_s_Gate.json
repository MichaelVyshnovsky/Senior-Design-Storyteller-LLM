        "mainbody": "The Farmers Gate was one of three entry points into the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe Farmers Gate provided access to the city from the north. The gate was located at the junction of the Farmers Road and Wall Street.\nThe gate was usually left open even at night. It was Daggerfords busiest gate given its proximity to the fields.\nThe gate was only accessible after crossing a moat and bridge. The road leading through the gate passed beneath a single guard tower. The Farmers Gate stood  tall."
