'''Nartan's Fine Foods''' was an upscale market located in the town of [[Daggerford]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It catered to both wealthy Daggerford residents and those visitors who had enough [[gp|gold]] to afford [[Nartan]]'s steep prices.

==Location==
It was located on the western side of Daggerford's [[Money Quarter]] in central Daggerford along the [[High Road (Daggerford)|High Road]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}

==Interior==
Nartan's shop was protected by a [[ward]] that preserved all the food within and prevented it from going bad.

==Services==
The shop offered a wide variety of high-quality foods and [[spices]] from all across [[Faer√ªn]], as far away as [[Chult]] or even the [[Ice Mountains]] in [[the North]].
