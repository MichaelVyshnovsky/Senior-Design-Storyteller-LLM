'''The Raging Lion''' was a large inn and tavern on the east side of the [[Trade Way]] in the north of [[Scornubel]].{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|113-114}}

==Description==
It was well guarded and had secure stables. It was generally unclean throughout, and a dirty gilded [[lion]] stood outside. Sometimes the residents left a severed animal head in the lion's open jaws as a joke, and sometimes the heads of intelligent creatures were left there as a sinister message or warning. Inside, the chamberpots were also gilded lion heads. The staff of the establishment were known for being slow and leisurely.

==Patrons==
Three adventuring bands once made their home at The Raging Lion, but when one of them returned with great wealth looted from a [[Netheril|Netherese]] ruin, the other two slaughtered them. The treasure remained undiscovered by [[1366 DR]].

==Food & Drink==
The food available included roasts, stews, and vegetables. Upon request, the chef would prepare a platter of fried stuffed [[snake]] in a poultry gravy with almonds, a personal favorite. [[Elturel|Elturian]] [[pheasant tail soup]] was available but it was not unknown for rodents and other low-quality meat to be used instead. [[Wine]] and spiced wine was available to drink, but ale was not sold.
