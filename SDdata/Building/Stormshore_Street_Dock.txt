It was a shorter dock located on the eastern side of the Gray Harbor at the end of Stormshore Street in the Brampton neighborhood of Baldurs Gate.
The Low Lantern tavern was housed within a ship permanently docked at Stormshore Street Dock. The dock itself was built between the larger dock to the north, Waendels Wharf, and a larger dock to the south, the Stormwynd Dock.
