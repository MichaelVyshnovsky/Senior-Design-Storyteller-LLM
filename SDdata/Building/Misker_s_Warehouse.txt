Miskers Warehouse was a warehouse in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
The warehouse was a three-story building in fair condition.
Like Miskers other properties, this warehouse appeared entirely unguarded from the outside. However, it was secretly protected by a series of lethal traps and at least one highly convincing illusion, designed to deter intruders and maintain the facade of an ordinary storage facility.
The warehouse held a variety of smuggled goods, carefully concealed within hidden compartments in standard containers such as crates, barrels, and sacks. These containers outwardly contained only mundane trade items, masking the more valuable or illicit contents within. This deceptive setup allowed Misker to carry out his complex smuggling operations while avoiding unwanted attention.
