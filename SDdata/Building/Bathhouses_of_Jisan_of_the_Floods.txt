The Bathhouses of Jisan of the Floods were located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Bathhouses of Jisan were located south of the Caravan District of Huzuz, Zakhara.
The separate structures for men and women were connected, but occupants were expected to remain on their appropriate side.
Individual baths and a large pool could be found within each bathhouse.
Priests of Jisan owned and administered the bathhouses, ensuring that the water was always clean and fresh.
A pair of efreet were used to make steam in the steam rooms.
The priests secretly spied on the occupants of the bathhouses in order to collect information.
