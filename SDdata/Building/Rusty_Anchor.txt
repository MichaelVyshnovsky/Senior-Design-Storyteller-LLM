The '''Rusty Anchor''' was a [[tavern]] located in the coastal city of [[Bezantur]] in [[Thay]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3870 Bezantur}}

==Location==
The Rusty Anchor was located along the docks in southern Bezantur on the [[Alamber Sea]] waterfront, next to a tattoo parlor.

==Atmosphere==
The Anchor was a smoky, dark place, and had dangerous fights break out on an hourly basis. Despite that, it was a fairly relaxed and happy place. The innkeeper [[Crow (innkeeper)|Crow]] made deals with the local ranking [[Red Wizards]], and in exchange they deflected any official trouble that might fall onto his establishment.

==Services==
The tavern had the services of its own barber, [[Thethro]], and a tattooist and piercer, [[Xamik]]. Piercings usually required the client to be drunk on [[ale]] and held down by several other patrons as Xamik worked.
