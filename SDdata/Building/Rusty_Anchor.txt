The Rusty Anchor was a tavern located in the coastal city of Bezantur in Thay during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Rusty Anchor was located along the docks in southern Bezantur on the Alamber Sea waterfront, next to a tattoo parlor.
The Anchor was a smoky, dark place, and had dangerous fights break out on an hourly basis. Despite that, it was a fairly relaxed and happy place. The innkeeper Crow made deals with the local ranking Red Wizards, and in exchange they deflected any official trouble that might fall onto his establishment.
The tavern had the services of its own barber, Thethro, and a tattooist and piercer, Xamik. Piercings usually required the client to be drunk on ale and held down by several other patrons as Xamik worked.
