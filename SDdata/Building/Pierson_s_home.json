        "mainbody": "iersons home was one of the houses in the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North. It belonged to Pierson.\nLocated in near the center of the village, Piersons home was located next to Tarmas home.\nLike the other houses in West Harbor, Piersons home was wooden.\nThe building was small. It was composed of a single room, with barrels, a bed, and a drawer.\nPierson lived in this house. When duergar and bladelings attacked the village in 1374 DR, Pierson locked himself in the house, afraid someone would steal his supplies. The Kalach-Cha was able to intimidate him, lie to him, pick the lock, or bash the door to get in. In any case, the Kalach-Cha couldve ordered him to get into the fight, since he was a member of the militia. After Pierson went to the field, the Kalach-Cha couldve looted his house or leave the supplies."
