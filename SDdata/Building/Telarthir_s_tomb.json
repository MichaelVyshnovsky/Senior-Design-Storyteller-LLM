        "mainbody": "elarthirs tomb was a hidden tomb from the days of unknown antiquity, located in the Delimbiyr Vale and forgotten by most by 1372 DR.\nthumb|The stone throne and the obelisk at the tombs entrance.|350x350px\nThe entrance to the ancient crypt was located at the bottom of a ravine in the Brush of Barbs. It was accessible by any capable climber after descending down the rough rock wall to a tight sandy spot at the base of the cliff. There, in a hidden alcove, stood a mysterious obelisk caked with centuries of dirt and grime. The monument was inscribed with angular runes. A knowledgeable person could decipher the inscription to read, \"Here lies the Great Telarthir, Emperor of the Ninth Dynasty of Lords.\" Next to the obelisk stood a stone throne of rough carving. The ancient throne was covered in barnacles, and a decayed skeleton occupied its seating area.\nThe entrance into the tomb was ensorcelled to transport visitors into its hidden vaults after a certain offering was made. The area itself was enchanted to whisper a clue in the breeze that blew through the ravine.\nThe passage was activated, with correct offerings, by uttering the command word \"Temotimoth.\" The entrances magic emanated swirling dark green mist that stretched from the obelisk to the throne. With a bright flash of light, the person who uttered the password was transported into the crypt.\nTelarthirs tomb was a huge square room just past a short entryway room with the gate magic that led to the Brush of Barbs. In the center stood a sarcophagus, surrounded by magical glowing symbols and circles. The sarcophagus was surrounded by four stone inanimate gargoyles. All along the walls of the room, simple stone sarcophagi were placed and continual flame enchanted braziers.\nAmong several valuable items found within the tomb was an enchanted rod of the ghost, a ring of crimson, and various gemstones. If any of the treasures of the tombs or sarcophagi were disturbed, the tombs resident, warrior mummy of Telarthir, raised to punish grave robbers. Along with the mummy, each simple sarcophagus released an angry skeleton warrior.\nGreat Telarthir, Emperor of the Ninth Dynasty of Lords, lived and died in the days of unknown antiquity, and by 1372 DR, no one remembered the person, the dynasty, or the kingdom. However, some ancient and obscure maps existed that could lead adventurers to the tombs location. In 1372 DR, Rugmax and Klevtor of Daggerford bought one such map, thinking it to be fake, for several coins and gave it to their friend Fernigold the Younger as a mean-spirited prank. The young man burned with adventure-lust and immodestly departed to get rich and have an adventure. No one has seen him since.\nThe boys distraught father asked the Hero of Daggerford to search for the missing youth. Subsequently, the Hero found a copy of the map and made way to the Brush of Barbs. Off an edge of a cliff, a rope dangled straight over the entrance to the lost tomb. The adventurer followed the young mans footsteps and solved the offering riddle, placing a bone, a badgers heart and a fenberry on the throne.\nInside, the Hero of Daggerford found Fernigold the Younger. His gaunt face was frozen in an expression of terror. He was dead, killed by the tombs undead inhabitants. The boys body was returned to Fernigold the Elder."
