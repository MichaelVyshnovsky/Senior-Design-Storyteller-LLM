        "Description": "The Hall was located on the ground level of the temple on the right side of the [[Grand Stairs]]. The Hall itself was roughly {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} long while the chamber at the end of the Hall measured {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} wide by {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} long.\n\nA trio of statues of the [[Enlightened One]] were found within the chamber, though the heads of each statue had been shattered by the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. Frescoes adorned the walls of the chamber, but these had been defaced. A single small altar to [[Li Pei]] sat upon the chamber's central dais."
