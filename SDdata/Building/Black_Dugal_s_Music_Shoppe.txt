'''Black Dugal's Music Shoppe''' was a music store in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
This store was situated in the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] district of Ravens Bluff, along two nameless lanes in the neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff/Anvil|Anvil]]. It was surrounded by [[fish]]-drying warehouses and was around the corner from [[Vlard's Maintenance Yard]].

==Structure==
This shop was an old, repurposed two-story stone building.

==Interior==
The main floor consisted of a single large room cluttered with instruments laying on the floor, hanging from the ceiling or wall, or resting on stands and tables. They rarely had dust on them, as the store's owner spent part of his free time wiping them. The only clear area within the room was a workspace in the rear left corner.

Opposite of that workspace was a staircase leading up to the building's second floor, the living quarters of the store's owner.

==Services==
Black Dugal's sold a variety of instruments including [[cittern]]s, [[dulcimer]]s, [[flute]]s, [[harp]]s, [[lute]]s, [[lyre]]s, and [[recorder]]s. The instruments available in this store were all carved and shaped by [[Dugal Buchannan]], who used the finest materials and would not settle for any of his work having a flaw.

Select customers were given the privilege of viewing special instruments that were stored in cases behind the counter. Each instrument was [[item enchantment|enchanted]] with runes, inscribed with enchanted tools, which endowed them with a [[wizard]]s' spell of first through third level. These spells were either defensive or benign, owing to Dugal being a devout pacifist.

The spell of each instrument could be cast up to three times per day by playing a melody to which the runes were [[Attunement|attuned]]â€”these were repetitive musical renditions of a spell's [[verbal component]]. These melodies were always taught to the buyer by Dugal at the time of their purchase. Once the melody was played, an instrument would resonate and activate its runes, which served as the [[somatic component]] of their spell.

In [[1370 DR]], he had on display a flute with ''[[knock]]'' for 2,600 [[gp]], a lute with ''[[continual light]]'' for 3,200 gp, a lyre with ''[[detect magic]]'' for 3,000 gp, and a recorder with ''[[dispel magic]]'' for 3,500 gp. Other spells he could offer on an instrument included ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[blur]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[whispering wind]]''. All spells were sourced from Dugal's own [[spellbook]].

Dugal accepted special orders for both mundane and enchanted instruments. The time they took to make varied depending on their size and complexity. A single mundane instrument could take anywhere from one to ten months, while an enchanted one could take three to twelve months. In addition, Dugal was usually working on multiple instruments at any given time.{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Living City: Black Dugal's Music Shoppe|25}} and/or metals.
