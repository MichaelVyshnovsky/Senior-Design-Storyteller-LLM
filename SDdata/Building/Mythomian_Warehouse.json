        "mainbody": "The '''Mythomian Warehouse''' was a warehouse in the [[enclave]] of [[Eileanar]], also used as a hideout for the [[Neth Underground for Freedom Fighters]].",
        "Location": "The site was located towards the southwestern side of the enclave, though not particularly close to the edge.",
        "Services": "The warehouse was kept at freezing temperatures by a permanent ''[[ice storm]]'' and several open ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Paraelemental Plane of Ice]], allowing it to preserve meat and fish for customers. Despite its cheap prices, it received little business as warehouses closer to the enclave's docks out-competed it.\n\n[[Adrian Freeman]], the owner, was also the leader of the Neth Underground and used the warehouse as a base. He employed [[Beaufort]], [[Debay]], [[Trebonius]], [[Bagshaw]], [[Whichcoot]] to maintain the business while he focused on his plans, though he didn't fully trust them. Trebonius was trusted with handling the warehouse's accounting, though only with Adrian's personal oversight and auditing. Bagshaw and Debay were responsible for maintaining the ice conduits, including shovelling excess snow and ice outside when it built up, while Beaufort and Whichcoot were tasked with guarding the premises against intruders and thieves."
