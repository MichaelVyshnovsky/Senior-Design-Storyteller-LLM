The '''occupied temple''' in [[Veil (town)|Veil]] was a place of worship that was dedicated to [[Bane]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It also served as the headquarters for the [[Thayan]] soldiers occupying the town. 

==Structure==
It was a small building intended for religious ceremonies, but which was transformed into a miniature fortress by its Thayan occupiers. It was reinforced with [[steel]] and stone.

==Activities==
The temple was the headquarters of [[Renault Abrecht]], a [[Banite]] [[priest]] who commanded the Thayan garrison. He conducted services and held court within the fortress.

==History==
The temple had originally been dedicated to a variety of [[god]]s before the Thayan and Banite occupation.

Following the attacks by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] on Veil and [[Surcross]] and the arrival of [[Kolthunral]] to the area in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the temple was the locus of efforts by Renault to begin converting the inhabitants of Veil to the worship of Bane.
