'''Blackiron Blades''' was a small smithy and weapons shop in [[Bryn Shander]] in [[Icewind Dale]]. Located a short distance north of the town square, it was known as a one-stop shop for travelers and [[adventurer]]s.

==Services==
The smith, [[Garn]], made and sold the cheapest blades in the [[Ten-Towns]], rather than trying to make better weapons to compete against the [[dwarves]] of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]. Garn's weapons were worth half the typical price. To keep the shop profitable, the manager of the store, Garn's sister [[Elza]], marked up all other goods by 50%. She also expanded the shop's product line to include various adventuring supplies, such as fur [[cloak]]s and [[snowshoes]].

Many veteran sellswords in Bryn Shander had disdain for Garn's lack of skill as a craftsman and joked about the quality of his blades, telling tales of unfortunate travelers that often ended with the words "…an' 'e was carryin' a Blackiron blade, to boot!"
