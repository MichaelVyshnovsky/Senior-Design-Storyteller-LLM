He just told me that your mother was a scum-sucking bottom dweller and that you were a spineless coward! I wouldn't take that from him! He's got a big mouth, but he's all talk!

        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The tavern was known for being filled with [[pipe]] smoke and rowdy customers of all types: pirates, sailors, smugglers, slavers, and even [[ogre]]s, [[gnoll]]s, and half-monster-breed clientele, thanks to the town's general obscurity and difficulty of access. Typical entertainment included a [[fiddle]]r, [[zither]] player, and a [[drum]]mer."
        },
        "Services": "The tavern and an inn offered ramshackle lodgings to its guests and stayed in business thanks to being the only place a traveler could find shelter from perilous marshes, bandits, and [[troll]]s. However, despite its lacking of accommodations, the inn's main amenity was its bar. Its taproom was packed nightly by people who made a journey by boat just to partake in the revelries, talk business, and enjoy the wide selection of beverages on offer; some said to be the widest selection all along the Sword Coast. The business remained open until 2 a.m. daily. Everyone was welcome unless they wanted to enforce the law or preach some deity's worship.\n\n[[Red-dog rum]] was a cheap [[rum]] on the tavern's menu.",
        "History": "The Wailing Wave was a colorful name inspired by a local legend that on some moonlit nights, one could hear the sorrowful cries of the drowned in the sound of the waves that washed over Lathtarl's Lantern's pebble beaches.\n\nBefore the mid-14{{th}} century DR, one regular customer of the inn was [[Old Jason McCully]], a terror of the sea, who died by hanging in [[Neverwinter]], but not before spitting in the executioner's eye."
