        "mainbody": "'''The Broken Pick''' was a tavern and inn in the city of [[Torich]], [[Samarach]].",
        "Interior": "The tavern's taproom was constructed in a traditional way for drinking establishments in Samarach – in the shape of a cross. Tables, booths, and places to mingle were placed at each end of the structure. At the center stood the bar from where the innkeeper did business. One of the taproom's ends was part of the kitchen with ovens and kitchen stations, next to a storage area for edible goods and libations. The Broken Pick had at least one more floor, above the taproom.",
        "Services": "The Broken Pick offered drinks and food to its guests as well as lodgings. It was open to visitors of Torich, despite Samarachan xenophobia. The typical clientele included Samarachan patrolmen and countless salt miners – the city's main industry."
