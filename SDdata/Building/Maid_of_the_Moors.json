        "mainbody": "aid of the Moors was Beldora Thiiruins a warm and welcoming restaurant in Mornbryns Shield that served a limited but hearty menu including the local specialty, the bustards. Maid of the Moors was the only restaurant found in the Shield circa 1365 DR.\nThe Maid was a happy and uplifting spot in the dampness and dangers of the Evermoors where the hamlet of Mornbryns Shield was located.\nThe building itself had huge windows, filling the restaurant with the daylight. In case of storms or very common troll attacks on the hamlet, the restaurant covered the windows with fitted shutters.\nThe interior was welcoming, well-lit, with ferns and other types of plants hanging around the dining room.\nThe Maid carried food and non-alcoholic drinks. Beldora herself simply did not have enough time nor hands to serve alcohol or more complex mixed concoctions and simply recommended guests to stop at the Troll in Flames Inn for a pint. Maid of the Moors served tea, fruit juices, and hearty broths.\nThe meals of note served at the Maid included a few dishes. A fresh salad of local lettuce, olives, parsley, parsnips, cheese, and whitecurds (what we know as cottage cheese). A fryplate, all the fried goodness like tomatoes, bacon, mushrooms, all covered in sliced almonds, generously buttered scrambled eggs with pepper and a splash of brandy. Bustards, the locally hunted ground quail of the Evermoors, cooked smothered in clay inside the flaming oven, then in a covered pot, and served with quail eggs, vegetables and beef tallow. Beldora served bustards (two birds per order) on a large plate of abundant roasted vegetables and cabbage.\nPrices of food and services circa 1365 DR\n* Garden salad - 1 cp\n* Fryplate - 2 cp\n* Bustards platter - 6 sp\n* Turtle soup - 3 sp\n* Roast beef platter - 9 sp\n* Whole roast beef - 3 gp\n* Spiced river fish and eel platter - 5 sp\n* Spiced river fish platter - 8 sp\n* Spiced rice with buttered snails, nuts, and dunroot - 4 sp"
