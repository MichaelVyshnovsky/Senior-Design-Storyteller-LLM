The '''Silver Scythe''' was an inn in the town of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by [[Garnet Pennorth]].

==Structure==
While not a large inn, a grand meeting room was added in 1367 DR.

==Atmosphere==
[[Volo]] described the Silver Scythe as "forgettable, but not dreadful".

==History==
Hosting the annual meeting of the [[Merchants' Guild]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the local merchant [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]] arranged for the guild members and their retinues to be lodged in both the Silver Scythe and the [[Sheaf of Wheat]], since there were too many for one inn to accommodate. Barthelm also paid for Garnet to add a grand meeting room onto the inn, as well as supervised the stocking of its larder and cellar and brought chefs from [[Suzail]].
