The '''Sighing Vault''' was a [[Narfell]] vault in [[Dun-Tharos]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison||25}}

==Structure==
The vault extended for several hundreds of yards from the entrance to its middle; it was a single underground space, with a great subterranean ceiling.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|218-220|23}}

There was a second, smaller, round salt-white limestone dome in the approximate middle of the vault. That dome had a single entrance, which led to a narrow corridor that spiraled nine times to a single chamber in the middle of the vault; its ceiling vaulted to about {{SI|20|feet}}.

==Interior==
There were dilapidated domes, sarcophagi, containers earthernware and otherwise scattered and broken throughout. Larger vessels of stone and iron filled the cavern, so big that they resembled buildings; there were narrow clear spaces between them. These vessels were sometimes carved with faces, bodies, skulls, and fell symbology. Per [[Ususi Manaallin]], there was little magic to be detected.

The smaller vault in the middle was eggshell white on the inside, with nine pedestals.

===Atmosphere===
Shapes inside the vault glowed with foul light. Dust had accumulated for over a millenium. The slightest sound created whispering echoes.

==Defenses==
The demon Eschar guarded the vault.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|196|19}} The inner dome of the vault could only be accessed by walking around it nine times, each time speaking aloud the name and title of one lord of the [[Nine Hells]] in order.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|227-228|23}}

==History==
As of {{yearlink|1373}}, four of the nine pedestals in the center dome were empty; of the other five, only one held its original item: a night black cloak draped across a perfectly shaped hanger. The last four held items collected by Eschar, including a red dagger made of a single red talon, an orb of hazy green set in a golden ring, a sword made of bone, and the [[Queen Abiding]]'s controlling token. After Ususi Manaallin opened the vault, the priest [[Marrec]] recovered the token.

==Notable Inhabitants==
