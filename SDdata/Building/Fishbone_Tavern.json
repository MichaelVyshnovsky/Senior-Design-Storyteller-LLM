        "mainbody": "Fishbone Tavern was a rough-and-tumble drinking establishment near Luskans Open Shore docks.\nThe tavern was located a few blocks away from the Open Shore (an area of the Whitesails Harbor). It was close enough to smell the sea air and hear the sea gulls.\nThe building was easily recognized by the hanging sign above the door, which bore the establishments name as well as a real, rotting fish that was nailed to the board.\nThe inside was dark and cramped with only eight tables, each with stools for sitting. The long, dark-stained wooden bar dominated one side of the room, with oval plaques bearing yellowed fish skeletons adorning the wall behind it. The wall opposite the bar had a small, smoky fireplace.\nThe tavern catered to local laborers and fishers. It was also a popular haunt and thus a front for Dran Enterprises.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, every dockworker in Luskan was familiar with the Fishbone Tavern. \nBy the , both the owner, Fryer, and bouncer, Zurb, worked with Dran Enterprises. Fryer spied on her clientele on their behalf while Zurb kept their enemies out of the tavern. Members of Dran Enterprises frequented the tavern, while regulars who were not affiliated with that faction included Milo, Rakeem, Tortuk, and Velos."
