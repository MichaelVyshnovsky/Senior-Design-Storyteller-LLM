        "mainbody": "The Sleeping Giant was a rundown tap house in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.\nThe building was located at the end of the main street to the east of Phandalin, which ended in Tresendar Manor. and by its porch, which had several empty barrels of ale on display.\nThe Sleeping Giant was owned by a surly dwarf named Grista Kettlecopp, whose rude demeanor reflected the quality (or lack thereof) of the pub itself. It was the favored watering hole for cruder folk, and catered mostly to dwarf and human miners and ruffians.  The bar was filthy and poorly maintained, and townsfolk were known to dissuade visitors from going there.\nWhen the Redbrands occupied Phandalin in 1491 DR, they often visited the Sleeping Giant and loitered outside, accosting passersby.\nThe state of the tap house continued to deteriorate in the coming years, and by 1496 DR, the paint on the sign had completely worn away."
