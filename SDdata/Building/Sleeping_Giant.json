        "Location": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Sleeping Giant was owned by a surly dwarf named [[Grista Kettlecopp]], whose rude demeanor reflected the quality (or lack thereof) of the pub itself. It was the favored watering hole for cruder folk, and catered mostly to [[dwarf]] and [[human]] miners and ruffians.  The bar was filthy and poorly maintained, and townsfolk were known to dissuade visitors from going there."
