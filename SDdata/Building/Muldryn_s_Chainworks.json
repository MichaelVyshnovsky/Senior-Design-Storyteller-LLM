        "mainbody": "Muldryns Chainworks was a smithy and a chain-makers workshop located in the Shutters neighborhood of the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nThe smithy stood facing a humble pathway that hugged the muddy bank of the Fire River, connecting the riverside ends of the Deepaxe Way and Karen Court streets. Fruits & More grocer was located in the next building south.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Anskaler Muldryn was a well-known for the quality chains produced by his workshop, manned by several sweaty and muscled blacksmiths. Anskalers heavy-duty durable and dependable chains were in demand among fighters who sought quality chained weapons and drovers in need of gate-lock chains. Muldryn-work was not known for its delicate and handsome looks."
