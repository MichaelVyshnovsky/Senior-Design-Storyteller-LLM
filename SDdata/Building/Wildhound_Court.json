        "mainbody": "Wildhound Court was a courtyard in the Mountainside neighborhood of Waterdeep.  Its name was derived from the strange effect it had on stray dogs who seem to be attracted to the courtyard by an old curse. Dogs who entered the courtyard often turned savage and formed a pack even if they were normally docile."
