'''Castle Auck''' was a large keep in [[Auckney]], where the nobles of the area resided.

==Location==
Although Castle Auck was situated in the small village of Auckney, it was located several miles from where the peasants made their home. The castle was located on a small island connected to the town by a bridge.

==Structure==
The large structure was situated on an isle, which connected to the mainland via a stone bridge. It was of modest design. The castle contained eighteen rooms overall, for the noble family and their servants. Two low towers anchored the castle, which stood around 15' (4.5 m) tall. The lower structure of the castle was made into a dungeon, to keep prisoners.

==History==
Castle Auck was built some time before the {{YearlinkName|765}}, by the [[Dorgenast]] family who had ruled for the first two hundred years. The [[Auck]] family had assumed the castle after the first two centuries of Dorgenast rule via marriage.
