        "mainbody": "Steelspires was a castle on the continent of Arandron on Toril. It was the home of the steel dragons Malavauvrantarandra and Phaudrantanthildrar, together with their young.\nIt stood on a high, bare rocky ridge behind the bustling port city of Haunvaerune.\nSteelspires was built by stone giants for the dragons.\nIt was where Malavauvra had her last clutch of eggs, hatching Rauvrahrileenatandrar, Torthalindrarron, and Velsaertirden, as well as other wyrmlings who did not survive. From here, Malavauvra encouraged her surviving young to explore the neighboring human city.\nSome time around the 8 century DR, Phaudron left on an expedition to seek a rare material component. While he was away, Rauvrahreene discovered his notes on his arcane experiments, made copies, and slipped away to her own lair to devise a way to reverse her fathers spells. When Phaudron returned weary to Steelspires, she was waiting—Rauvrahreene secretly cast the reversed spells and slew her father. She then murdered her mother in her sleep the same way and seized control of Steelspires, turning it against her brothers by filling it with dragon-slaying traps. While she was doing so, Torthal returned to Steelspires to speak with Phaudron and was nearly killed by the traps. Gloating, Rauvrahreene openly admitted her guilt to her dying brother. Velsaertirden, also returning and overhearing this, attacked her, but in the chaos of battle, she escaped, injured but alive, while Torthal was obliterated. Afterward, the grieving Velsaertirden searched the castle, turned Rauvrahreenes traps against her as best he could in case she returned, and abandoned Steelspires forever, traveling to Faerûn."
