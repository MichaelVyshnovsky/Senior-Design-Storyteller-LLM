The '''Moon and Stars''' was a tavern in [[Waymoot]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was, according to [[Volo]], one of the greatest taverns in all of the Realms. 

==Geography==
Located relatively close to [[Suzail]], it was accessible enough to be convenient yet far enough to avoid frightening the capital's meeker inhabitants. It was the gathering place in Cormyr for all sorts of exalted and colorful characters, from pirates to [[centaur]]s and [[faerie dragon]]s. 

==Atmosphere==
Also full of intrigue, the Moon and Stars had more than once been the meeting place for the less-than-friendly organizations of [[Faerûn]] to gather in a civilized manner. Pirate lords, [[The Blades|Blade]]s from [[Mulmaster]], and agents from [[Thay]] had all met with [[Vangerdahast]], his senior advisers, or nobles of Cormyr to discuss foreign affairs within the walls of this establishment in order to avoid a public rendezvous that could end in disaster.

==Defense==
With all the potential for danger and conflict that surrounded the Moon and Stars, order had to be kept and a feeling of safety maintained for the varied clientele. This was accomplished by a veteran staff of [[ranger]]s and ex-adventurers, along with a [[War Wizard of Cormyr|war wizard]] or two, who were all allowed weapons within the tavern's walls.

==Services==
Considering the high profile of much of the Moon and Stars' clientele, the tavern offered private drinking chambers for those who wanted or needed to be discreet. As such, the average visitor would not see any venerated heroes or other exalted folk, but rather witnessed only the passing parade, while they enjoyed the hot [[bun]]s spread with [[pâté]]s, the diced [[fruit]] and [[pickle]]s, or the [[cheese]]-stuffed fried [[mushroom]] caps that were served. All of these delicious dishes were of course accompanied by a selection from the superb [[wine]] cellar the Moon and Stars had to offer or one of the substantial variety of brews and [[ale]]s it had available.

==History==
The Moon and Stars had a rich and notable history. For one, it was the venue where [[Florin Falconhand]] of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] first met [[Dove Falconhand|Dove]], the woman he would later marry. It was also the place where [[Azoun IV|King Azoun]] was attacked by a [[Zhentarim]] mage who [[Shapechange|shapechanged]] into the form of a [[beholder]]. The perpetrator was slain by a disguised [[ki-rin]], quietly playing cards in the corner of the tavern.
