'''Sonnmorndin''' was a fortress located on the island of [[Ruathym]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

==History==
The fortress was constructed in {{Yearlink|-4600}} on [[Arauwurbarak]] which would later become known as Ruathym. [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] marines from the [[Sailors of the Mountainous Waves]] from [[Haunghdannar]] built Sonnmorndin to be used as a naval base for their excursions into the sea.
