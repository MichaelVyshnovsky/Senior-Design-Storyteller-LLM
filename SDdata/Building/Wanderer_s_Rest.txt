The Wanderers Rest was a boarding house located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Wanderers Rest could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
The large boarding house could accommodate up to 20 guests at once. It was owned and operated by Fatima Kossi.
Guests of the Wanderers Rest could expect to pay 1 dirham per night. However, Fatimas kindheartedness meant that she often let true pilgrims stay for free.
