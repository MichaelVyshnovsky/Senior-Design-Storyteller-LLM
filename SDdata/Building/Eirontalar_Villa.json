        "mainbody": "irontalar Villa was the family estate of the Waterdhavian noble house of Eirontalar.\nThe Eirontalar Villa was located in the city block bounded by Diamond Street, Delzorin Street, Feather Street, and Vondil Street, in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.\nThey had a second villa  on the north side of Hassantyrs Street, in the middle of a block between Sul Street and Shield Street. It was a walled compound with three buildings and an inner garden.The map in the 3.5-edition City of Splendors Waterdeep displays two locations marked $33 for the Eirontalar Villa. This second one may in error and intended to be another site, but this is difficult to determine. On other maps, the site is unmarked.\nThe compound was a walled estate that consisted of some two-story buildings and some green space."
