Their primary specialty, however, was in veterinary care for horses, [[mule]]s, and [[donkey]]s. The staff could quickly and accurately diagnose a sickness or injury in an animal, and provide proper care for them. They could easily tell if a lame animal had been drugged to hide its condition. Horses in their care were kept in good health, fed well, and exercised appropriately. If they were not, then the owner would be granted a new and better horse in replacement. Sendever's Stables never sold a sick or lame horse.\n\nFor these services, Sendever's Stables was known for its reliability. The business was large and efficient. Though it had high costs, it did good and frequent business.\n\nSometimes, Sendever's Stables received and sold exotic mounts, such as a [[pegasus]]. Such beasts were usually sold at auction, rather than to regular customers.",
        "Staff": "Sendever's Stables was staffed by Illumor Sendever and more than a dozen expert employees, consisting of hostlers, trainers, and those who conducted horse husbandry.",
