It consisted of a sizeable set of paddocks and stables. The sign by the gate read \"Horses Bought, Sold, Doctored, and Boarded\".\nTo keep away horse-thieves, hired guards patrolled the stables and paddocks. They were armed with hand crossbows loaded with darts treated with a sleep-inducing poison.\nSendevers Stables was in business by 1358 DR. It was still in business through 1369 DR, and in 1374 DR.\nHere, the staff bought, sold, and boarded horses in their stables. They could also provide training for horses. Their primary specialty, however, was in veterinary care for horses, mules, and donkeys. The staff could quickly and accurately diagnose a sickness or injury in an animal, and provide proper care for them. They could easily tell if a lame animal had been drugged to hide its condition. Horses in their care were kept in good health, fed well, and exercised appropriately. If they were not, then the owner would be granted a new and better horse in replacement. Sendevers Stables never sold a sick or lame horse.\nFor these services, Sendevers Stables was known for its reliability. The business was large and efficient. Though it had high costs, it did good and frequent business.\nSometimes, Sendevers Stables received and sold exotic mounts, such as a pegasus. Such beasts were usually sold at auction, rather than to regular customers.\nSendevers Stables was staffed by Illumor Sendever and more than a dozen expert employees, consisting of hostlers, trainers, and those who conducted horse husbandry.\nCategoryShops\nCategoryHorsetraders\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryStables\nCategoryLocations in Wheloon\nCategoryLocations in Cormyr\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nq60cx6rjf1rinzm2r0ul53ewsayqo04"
