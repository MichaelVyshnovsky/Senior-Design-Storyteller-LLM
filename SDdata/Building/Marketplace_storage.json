        "mainbody": "The marketplace storage was a large warehouse located in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe building was made from stone and wood.\nThe warehouse was located along Wall Street in northwest Daggerford next to the market and Caravan Gate.\nMerchants with stalls in the nearby market could use the storage shed to house their wares overnight without risk of them being stolen or damaged by the elements if left out in the market. Members of the Daggerford militia kept a constant vigil on the building making it very difficult for opportunistic thieves to snatch anything."
