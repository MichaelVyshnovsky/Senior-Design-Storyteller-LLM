The Dragons Den was a tavern in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR, owned by Oleg One-Ear.
The tavern was taken over by the rowdy Purple Dragons garrison in town, quite against Olegs original wishes, but he knew to mind his own business.
It became the soldiers own hangout, and catered exclusively to them. Civilians who dared step inside without a Purple Dragon companion—and this happened only rarely—were likely to be pelted with tankards and even chairs. Those who persisted were beaten up and thrown out.
With patrons like these, the Den had no need of a bouncer.
