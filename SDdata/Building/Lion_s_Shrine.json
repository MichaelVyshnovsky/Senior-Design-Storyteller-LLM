        "Location": "The Lion's Shrine was located deep within the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]] in Sarahin.",
        "Description": "This mosque of Hajama, and the surrounding minarets, were decorated with beautiful green tile.\n\nA pair of [[griffon]] statues sat on either side of the main stair leading to the shrine's entrance. [[Farouk Abd al-Bazan]] stored his gritty phoenix powder poison within a hidden compartment located under the wing of the northernmost statue. While invisible, he checked on his cache daily to make sure it was secure.\n\nA lion pit housing a grown lioness stood in the courtyard of the mosque. The pit was the site of the [[Lion's Mouth]], a test of courage for holy slayers.\n\nThe main altar of the mosque held the [[Heart of the Lion]], the most cherished relic of the [[Everlasting]].",
        "Activities": "Daily prayers were held at the Lion's Shrine. The sacred texts of Hajama were stored within, but only the most devout of [[holy slayer]]s were allowed to enter. Guards from the [[Courageous]] were stationed at the entrance at all times to prevent intruders."
