The Scarlet Pearl was an inn located in the town of Yhep.
The inn offered travelers luxurious private rooms that were quite expensive. However, the excellent quality of the food and service made it worth the cost. The common room had comfortable booths that were veiled for additional privacy, and one could dine on the finest seafood from the Lake of Steam and drink wine that was imported from across Faer√ªn.
