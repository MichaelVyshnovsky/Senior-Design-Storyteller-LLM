'''Sword Bridge''' was a bridge that connected [[Luskan]]'s [[Closeguard Island]] and [[Cutlass Island]] in the [[River Mirar]]. Only members of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] or of [[Ship Kurth]] were permitted to cross. 

==Structure==
It was a short, arching bridge

==Defenses==
As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Arcane Brotherhood had placed a secret [[ward]] on Sword Bridge that allowed them to summon [[battle horror]]s to protect access to Cutlass Island.

==History==
When forces led by [[Deudermont]] and Lord [[Brambleberry]] attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, a major turning point occurred when [[Kurth|High Captain Kurth]] permitted their forces to cross the [[Dark Arch]] and Sword Bridge to attack Cutlass Island and the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] by land. Sword Bridge was defended at this time by the Brotherhood's [[wizard]]s, who were insufficient to stop the attackers.

When efforts to rebuild the Host Tower began in the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Beniago Kurth]]'s control over the bridge (and thus access to Cutlass Island) allowed him to persuade the newcomers into an alliance with his Ship ''circa'' [[1484 DR]].

When [[House Margaster]] invaded Luskan in the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, Sword Bridge was briefly occupied by [[gnoll]]s.
