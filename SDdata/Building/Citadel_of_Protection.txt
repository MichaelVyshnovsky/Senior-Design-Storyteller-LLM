The '''Citadel of Protection''' was a grand temple of [[Helm]] located in the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. It took up an entire city block between [[DeVillars Ride]], [[Blacktree Boulevard]] and [[Raven Way]], within the district's [[Altarside]] neighborhood and soared into the sky. 

==Description==
The Citadel was an awesome, circular keep that, at first glance, resembled a city armory or grand governing building. The immensely-tall stronghold featured a central turret that ascended well above the city's skyline, perhaps the highest spot within all the Bluff. The exterior of the spire had an observation area complete with giant, [[brass]]-framed lenses that allowed for a closer view of the cityscape from the lofty vantage point.
