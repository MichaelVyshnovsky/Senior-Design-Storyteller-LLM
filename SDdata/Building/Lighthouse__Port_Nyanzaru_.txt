The '''lighthouse''' of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], was used to guide ships into port and to send smoke signals along the coast of the [[Bay of Chult]].

==Location==
The lighthouse was located in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]] at the mouth of the harbor itself, immediately across the harbor entrance from [[Fort Nyanzaru]]. It served to anchor the mighty [[chain]] that could be used to close access to the port. 

==Activities==
The beacon at the top of the lighthouse maintained a constant signal flame that was visible through the dark of night, rain, and fog, and served to guide ships into port.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|6}} 

In times of pirate attack, the beacon's color was changed to a bright red to warn the people of the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|6}} At night, this light was bright enough to bathe the entire harbor in an eerie red glow.{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|37}}

The fire of the lighthouse could also be used to send smoke signals that were visible from anywhere on the Bay of Chult, from the mines in the northwest to [[Fort Beluarian]] in the northeast. These signals were created by adding various powders to the flames, which produced thick columns of colorful smoke.

==History==
When Port Nyanzaru came under attack by the [[fiend]]ish pirate [[Idrianne Smoke]] during the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 1400s [[DR]],{{ToA-time}} the lighthouse's crimson beacon provided the city with its first warning of her approach.
