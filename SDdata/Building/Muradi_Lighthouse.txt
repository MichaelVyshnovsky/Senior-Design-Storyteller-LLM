The Muradi Lighthouse was a lighthouse standing at the very southwestern tip of the Koryo Peninsula in Koryo in the 14th century DR.
In 1308 DR, Bosturo came to be the Master of the Muradi Lighthouse. With dedicated service, he had held this position for 49 years by 1357 DR. At one point, he received a scroll of commendation from the ex-king of Silla, and displayed it proudly in his studio.
Atop the lighthouse was a huge oil lamp. Its purpose was to warn of the flaming seas that lay off the coast to the south.
The lighthouse keeper, Bosturo, was also a noted scholar on the flora and fauna of Koryo, and gave his advice for a fee or a conversation.
