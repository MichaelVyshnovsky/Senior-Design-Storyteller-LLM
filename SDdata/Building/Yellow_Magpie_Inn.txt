The '''Yellow Magpie Inn''' was an inn in the [[T'u Lung]] city of [[Balanzia]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2310|SY}}.

==Location==
This inn was located in the eastern portion of Balanzia, a few blocks away from the Gate of Hang'to.

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|2403|SY}}, the Yellow Magpie was one of many buildings that were destroyed in Balanzia as the city fell at the hands of the [[Shou Lung]] invasion of T'u Lung.The Yellow Magpie Inn is not explicitly stated in text to have been destroyed in the incident that destroyed the city. However, on the "before-and-after" maps of Balanzia in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' the building is not present on the "after" version. Therefore, it can be inferred that it was likely destroyed.
