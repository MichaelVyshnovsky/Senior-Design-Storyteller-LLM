The '''Think Easy''' was a social club attached to the '''Gehirn Cibus''' restaurant deep in the [[Underdark]], owned and operated by the [[mind flayer]] entrepreneur [[Brikhalna Ipprszhen|Brikhalna "Dutch" Ipprszhen]].

==Services==
The Think Easy served as a select club for Dutch's friends, business partners, and other trusted associates. Because his social circle was made up of gangsters and crime-lords, he enforced the civility of his patrons by the threat of an elite team of [[drow]] assassins. This ensured that the Think Easy was kept a safe neutral ground, and high-stakes business deals could be conducted peacefully at his tables.

==History==
After earning great wealth as an independent businessman, Dutch became part-owner of the Gehirn Cibus restaurant, already a famed and popular Underdark location. Later, he opened up the attached Think Easy as a way of expanding his business.

==Inhabitants==
Aside from Dutch himself, prominent clients of the Think Easy included [[drow]] matriarch [[Felyndiira Shi'narrvha|Felyndiira "Mad Money" Shi'narrvha]], the hit man [[beholder]] [[Vikhrumn Coll|Vikhrumn "100 Gold" Coll]], the [[deep gnome]] fence [[Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn|Gnormahlenvaey "Squeaky" Catoneriehn]], and the assassin [[Gray'shivnarien Taliain|Gray'shivnarien "the Fiddler" Taliain]].{{Cite dragon/228/Rogues Gallery: Gangsters of the Underdark|58}}

Naturally, law-enforcement types like Sir [[Elliot of Kness]] were not welcome at Dutch's establishment.
