The Sleeping Snake was a tavern in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This store stood on Dock Street, across from the shop Nestaurs Ropes.
The Sleeping Snakes structure stood only a single story tall.
This tavern was roughly furnished with furniture that were all hastily mended.
The Sleeping Snake had a rather rowdy atmosphere to it, being frequented by dockhands patrons who often broke the establishments furniture over each others heads.
In addition to the standard tavern fare, the Sleeping Snake employed human, half-elf, and half-orc dancers that performed atop of tables. Sometimes even singing. These dancers were willing to do activities besides dancing for a negotiable price. Anyone who harmed the dancers was charged a fine of a single silver piece.
Rumors around the Sleeping Snake suggested that one could encounter a fence for stolen goods within the establishment. In truth this rumor was false, but utilized by the Red Sashes member, Hlintas Urtel, most evenings to spy on those engaging in shady business.
