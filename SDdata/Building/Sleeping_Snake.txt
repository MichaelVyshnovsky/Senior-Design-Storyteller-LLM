The '''Sleeping Snake''' was a tavern in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].<ref>

==Location==
This store stood on [[Dock Street (Waterdeep)|Dock Street]], across from the shop [[Nestaur's Ropes]].

==Structure==
The Sleeping Snake's structure stood only a single story tall.
===Interior===
This tavern was roughly furnished with furniture that were all hastily mended.

==Atmosphere==
The Sleeping Snake had a rather rowdy atmosphere to it, being frequented by dockhands patrons who often broke the establishment's furniture over each others' heads.

==Services==
In addition to the standard tavern fare, the Sleeping Snake employed [[human]], [[half-elf]], and [[half-orc]] dancers that performed atop of tables. Sometimes even singing. These dancers were willing to do activities besides dancing for a negotiable price. Anyone who harmed the dancers was charged a fine of a single [[silver piece]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Rumors around the Sleeping Snake suggested that one could encounter a fence for stolen goods within the establishment. In truth this rumor was false, but utilized by the [[Red Sashes]] member, [[Hlintas Urtel]], most evenings<ref> to spy on those engaging in shady business.
