The '''Lady's Happy Hall''' was a temple of [[Tymora]] in the Temple District of the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]

==Organization==
By [[1357 DR]] and through [[1367 DR]], it was led by High Priest [[Orn Thavil]], with 24 subordinate priests and 16 lay-followers.

The priesthood of [[The Lady's Favor]] temple in the [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]] were under the authority of the Lady's Happy Hall temple.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

==History==
In [[Marpenoth]] of the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], when Procampur was struck by the [[featherlung]] plague, Thavil worked with High Priest [[Baniya Dolester]] of [[Lliira]] and set up auxiliary shrines in the District of the Poor to treat the sick there. Though their actions halted the spread of the disease, the Thultyrl reprimanded both high priests for breaking Procampur's district rules, and were reminded that the city and its laws were older than a number of deities.

Around [[Kythorn]] of the [[1369 DR|Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], a convoy secretly transported the ''[[torque of faith]]'', a holy item of [[Tymora]], to The Lady's Favor temple in Sevenecho. However, the [[Vipers]] bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans at the Lady's Happy Hall temple were outraged by the attack and the theft.
