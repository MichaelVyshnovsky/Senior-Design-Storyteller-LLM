During the reign of Boldovar the Mad, the windows of the keep were turned into barred slits.\nIn the years leading up to the , the aristocrats and bureaucrats had gradually been thrown out of the keep itself, and had formed a collection of stone buildings further down the hillside, known as the Noble Court, or simply the court.\nIn the , Thauglor, a huge black dragon, attacked the castle and demolished around a quarter of it, setting fire to the remaining structure and causing extensive damage.

Although it had been disliked by many in the royal family over the years, it had been allowed to remain on the advice of sages who thought that it would bring bad fortune to destroy it. It was moved to its last position by Rhigaerd II, who took the opportunity to hide it away when a room in a turret became damaged, opening a hole. Because of the difficult access through a narrow ladder shaft, the phrase \"go and polish the maiden\" was sometimes used to mean \"go away\".\n Brightsun Bower\n Chamber of Charts one of many chambers within the castle.
