        "mainbody": "The Hanged Man was a tavern in the Dock Ward of the city of Waterdeep.\nThis tavern was located on the eastern corner of Pressbow Lane and Net Street.\nThe Hanged Man stood only a single story tall.\nThis tavern offered a fine selection of wines, far better than one might suspect it to have, as well as a wide variety of ales. \nThe Hanged Man was often frequented by literary and artistic folk, including calligraphers, poets, scriveners, and writers. Many of whom were likely to regale their fellow patrons with tales. The clientele also had a tendency to be rude, opinionated, and smoke pipes."
