        "mainbody": "'''The Oar and Wagonwheel Inn''' was an inn in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nPoor but cheap, it was the exception to the generally quality Elturian inns, yet it was always packed with patrons. It was crowded, noisy and raucous, and a resembled a drafty barn.\n\nAs Lord [[Dhelt]] decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Oar and Wagonwheel was expressly an inn."
