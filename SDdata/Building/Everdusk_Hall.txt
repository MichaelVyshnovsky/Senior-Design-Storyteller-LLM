'''Everdusk Hall''', before being burnt to the ground, was one of the oldest and most revered temples in [[Silverymoon]]. It was a member of the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]].

==Interior==
The lower levels of this temple were decorated with many marble statues of the [[Seldarine|elven gods]].

In the upper levels of the diamond-shaped hall was a library that contained many shelves filled with tomes and scrolls, all written in the [[Elven language|Elven tongue]].

==History==
Long a place of worship for the [[elves]] of Silverymoon, Everdusk Hall was sadly burnt down by a mysterious fire in the {{yearlinkName|1347}}. Despite attempts by nearby [[Spellguard]] to quell the flames, the building had to be rebuilt from scratch.

In the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, Everdusk Hall was still being run by the venerated elven priest, [[Elaith Waterstill|Loremaster Elaith Waterstill]]. 

Sometime before [[1372 DR]], the new [[Loremaster]] in charge was [[Vadalathra Rivermantle]].

==Inhabitants==
* [[Elaith Waterstill]]
