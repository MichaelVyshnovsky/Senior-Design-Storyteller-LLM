The Steel Serpent was an average inn found in the city of Dihliz in 1367 DR.
Certainly not the first choice for anyone with financial means, the Steel Serpent was a low-budget option where adventurers stayed while passing through Dihliz. Occupants shared a common sleeping area, making theft of personal belongings a common occurrence.
The inn was owned and operated by a retired treasure-hunter named Tahani.
