The '''Lady's College''' was the first open school for mages in [[Silverymoon]]. It was considered by many to be the heart of the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]].

==Services==
The education system of Lady's College was unique, as unlike the other schools at the time, it didn’t utilize the traditional apprentice-master dynamic, in which a master took on several apprentices, and slowly taught them magic in exchange for servitude. The Lady's College took on aspiring mages as students, not as servants.{{Template:Cite book/The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier/Cities & Civilization|52}}  

The radically different teaching philosophy of Lady's College made the school a polarizing institution,{{Speculation}} though even its detractors agreed that its graduates were not only talented wizards, but also well rounded scholars.

==History==
The school was established in the {{YearlinkName|821}}, by [[Alustriel Silverhand|Elué Dualen]] and [[Lynx]].{{Template:Cite book/Silver Marches|57}}

By the {{yearlinkName|1371}}, the student system of Lady’s College became the standard in magical education throughout [[Silverymoon]],{{Template:Cite book/The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier/Cities & Civilization|48}}
