        "mainbody": "'''Tabra's''' was a combined [[festhall]] and rooming house in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by and named for [[Tabra]] and had a reputation for being a \"must visit\" place in the North, even being known in [[Waterdeep]].\n\n{{quote|â€¦feels like home.|A female merchant and regular visitor}}",
        "Location": "It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the central northern side on the street known as the Rise between [[Belvyn's House of Good Cheer]] and [[Belvyn]]'s actual house.<ref><ref>",
        "Structure": "The building was tall and sported many balconies.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "With a relaxed, home-like atmosphere, Tabra's was popular with men and women alike, and they could simply ignore the escorts seducing their clients nearby. Guests could always find someone to talk to or join in on one of the several gambling games that were constantly going on."
        },
        "Services": "One could hire a room for 2 [[gp]] a night, with all meals included and escorts not. \n\nThe meals on offer were basic yet tasty, including [[oyster]]s and [[mushroom]]s on toast; [[spice]]d [[scrambled eggs]]; and [[leek]]-and-leftovers soup that was chunky with vegetables, meat, and [[cheese]]. As a result, one could usually find patrons lingering in or outside the kitchens.\n\nAn escort could be hired for 25 gp for a full day of their time, lasting from highsun to highsun. There were at least a dozen ladies in residence at any one time in the mid-1360s DR, and they were known for their casual and friendly manner. Regularly, many of them were hired by wealthy merchants, guilds, and adventuring companies for revels at the House of Good Cheer next door.<ref>",
        "History": "Some time in the mid-1350s DR, a [[black dragon]] descended on Bargewright Inn with the intent of assaulting the settlement. According to local legend, Tabra jumped off her bedroom balcony, transformed midair into a [[dragon]] herself (those who tell the story disagree on the type), and chased it off. True or not, Tabra hated the tale and angrily evicted anyone who dared repeat the story in her earshot.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Tabra disappeared from her house and Bargewright Inn,<ref> and was not seen again.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some folk, such as [[Volo]], thought Tabra to be a mage, but she denied all knowledge of magic. More amazingly, other people rumored that she was in fact a [[gold dragon]] in [[human]] guise and protecting a treasure hoard beneath the building. Supposedly she was hiding from a mightier dragon that would wipe out her and the whole community if the truth was ever revealed. However, she did indeed have treasure stashed in various parts of the building and beyond, including in the roof and in her canopied bed."
