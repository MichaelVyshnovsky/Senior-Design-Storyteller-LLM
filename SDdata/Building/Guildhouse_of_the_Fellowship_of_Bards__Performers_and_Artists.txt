The '''Guildhouse of the Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists''' was a building in [[Ravens Bluff]] that served as the headquarters of the city's [[Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists|bards guild]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was located within the city's wealthy [[Altarside]] neighborhood, on the corner of [[Moorland Ride]] and [[Raven Way]], sharing a wall with the [[Ravens Bluff Playhouse|Bluff's theater]]. While it was located in one of the more affluent neighborhoods in the rich [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]], it was close enough to [[Crow's End]] and the [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]] to attract attention among the commoners to the adjacent Playhouse.

==Activities==
Bards, performers and artists could always be found in the common areas of the guildhouse, singing, playing music, reciting lines, or otherwise performing, though they would also use this space to give lessons or argue about their craft with one another.

==Description==
===Exterior===
The home of the bards of Ravens Bluff was located within a four-story, building that resembled manor house. Its foundation, ground and second floor were formed from smooth-cut stone blocks, while its upper levels were made from dark-stained wood and was adorned with many windows.

In front of the entrance of the guildhall, was a large carved wooden sign that depicted musical instruments, artists' tools, juggling balls and bardic accessories surrounding the hall's name, engraved in large letters.

Just west of the guildhall and playhouse was an open lot of muddy earth that was locally-known as the "Tumbling Yard". It was used by the performers and guild members between performances, and served as parking for coaches on show nights.

===Interior===
Within the guildhouse was vast common room with a cozy atmosphere, that felt more like an old, familiar tavern rather a place of guild business. It was well-furnished, with some exquisite, and less-than-exquisite, tables and chairs that were crafted by the guild's master woodcrafter, [[Randall Morann]], and his apprentice [[Jolan]], respectively. Also on the ground floor were a few, seldom-used private dining rooms and the hall's kitchens.

Accessible by a broad stairway, the second floor of the hall was dedicated to practice rooms for its members. These individual areas had thick walls and floors to prevent bards from disturbing one another with their rehearsals and performances.

The top two floors were dedicated to living quarters and dormitories for members of the guild. The third story had individual rooms reserved for the hall's minstrels and Master Bards. The top story was divided into a large shared room with bunks that served the apprentices, while its smaller rooms housed journeymen performers and bards.

==Trivia==
The elaborate sign of the guildhouse was crafted by its skilled woodcrafter Randall.
