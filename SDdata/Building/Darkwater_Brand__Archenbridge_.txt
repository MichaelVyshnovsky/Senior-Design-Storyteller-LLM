The Darkwater Brand was the best shop to buy weapons, armors, shields, and various adventuring gear in the city of Archenbridge during the 14 century DR.
The shop was located on the northern part of town, near Pelters Street.
This large, well-guarded shop sold a variety of fighting implements and metalwares, such as nails, lamps, hooks and spikesâ€”most of which were imported from the Moonsea region. All goods sold there were of good quality, from well-oiled blades to straight nails.
Owned by the eponymous trading coster, employees bought ore and vegetables from Archendale to trade for those metal goods abroad. The coster also provided other services, such as bodyguards and escorts for precious cargo.
According to some Arkhenfolk, an invisible creature watched over the shop and hunted down would-be thieves.
