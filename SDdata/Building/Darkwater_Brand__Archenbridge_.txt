The '''Darkwater Brand''' was the best shop to buy [[weapon]]s, [[armor]]s, [[shield]]s, and various adventuring gear in the city of [[Archenbridge]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The shop was located on the northern part of town, near Pelter's Street.

==Services==
This large, well-guarded shop sold a variety of fighting implements and metalwares, such as [[nail]]s, [[lamp]]s, hooks and [[spike]]sâ€”most of which were imported from the [[Moonsea]] region. All goods sold there were of good quality, from well-[[oil]]ed blades to straight nails.

Owned by the [[Darkwater Brand|eponymous trading coster]], employees bought ore and vegetables from [[Archendale]] to trade for those metal goods abroad. The coster also provided other services, such as bodyguards and escorts for precious cargo.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to some [[Arkhenfolk]], an invisible creature watched over the shop and hunted down would-be [[thieves]].
