        "mainbody": "The Temple of Gargauth was a place of worship dedicated to the cruel god Gargauth in Bezantur, Thay.\nThe temple was located in northeastern Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". It abutted the House of Iyachtu Xvim to its south.\nDespite Gargauth being openly worshiped across Thay, his followers in Bezantur were treated with cautious superstition, owing to the fact that their cruel god was known to kill and devour his worshipers. and despite this they were fervent in their devotion.\nThe Temples rituals were carried out at midnight. Participants wore Gargauths symbol openly and proudly on their chests, and were led in such ceremonies by a high priest.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Gargauth was not a popular god in Bezantur, although his few followers were zealous. The high priest at the time was Marr, who spread rumors that Gargauth visited the temple to feast on his supplicants. However, many doubted that this was true, and presumed that the priest had invented these tales to conceal accidental deaths among his flock."
