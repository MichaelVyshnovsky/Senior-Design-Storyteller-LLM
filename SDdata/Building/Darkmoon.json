        "Location": "Darkmoon was located somewhere north of [[Waterdeep]] in a secluded forest. The temple itself was built upon a large rock formation that led down to the ground via a curved path.",
        "Structure": "The temple consisted of a main building, under which were ancient catacombs. There were also three large towers that surrounded the main temple: silver, azure, and crimson. As well as the large towers, there was a prison that kept [[frost giant]]s.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "At first, Darkmoon appeared to have a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The [[cleric]]s appeared good-willed and seemed happy to help others in distress, but were actually just masking their evil intentions to conquer Waterdeep.\n\nIn many areas of the temple, Darkmoon was swarming with evil creatures, from [[basilisk]]s, to [[beholder]]s."

        "History": {
            "Ancient History": "[[Drow]] [[elves]] had, hundreds of years prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ascended to the surface and built the temple. The cold-hearted dark elves started to vie for power between themselves, which eventually led to their downfall and the destruction of the temple. Mysteriously, their leader, [[Dran Draggore]], disappeared without a trace.",
            "Modern History": "By the mid–14{{th}} century DR, the temple appeared to be rebuilt and active again, and was apparently still under the leadership of Dran. This meant that he was most likely very old, and very powerful. At this time, many feared Darkmoon, but the clerics of the temple appeared very friendly. Around this time, [[Wently Kelso]] went missing when returning from an investigation of an ancient village, known as [[Torzac]], north of Waterdeep. [[Oltec]] of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Waterdhavian City Guard]] found an overturned carriage, and Kelso's journals nearby. Kelso noted that he had a vision of evil occurrences in the area, and [[human]] remains in shallow graves. As well as Kelso's journals, some townsfolk near the area had gone missing. Oltec let [[Khelben Arunsun]] know about the issue, who sent out a scout, [[Amber]], to infiltrate the temple. Amber, although she managed to get inside the temple, died on her mission. Khelben was distressed, and called upon the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] to investigate the area."
