The temple of Jergal on the Sword Coast was a ruined temple-crypt dedicated to the Lord of the Dead, one of few of its kind found throughout Faer√ªn.
It was located the north bank of the River Chionthar, close to the border of Elturgard.
The temple and crypts were built into the side of a cliff that overlooked the river. While the ground-level architecture was largely in ruin, the underground chambers remained relatively intact.

The upper level of the temple comprised a series of large rooms set into a row, including a feasting hall, a central chamber, and bunkrooms.
Beneath that was the temples crypts, which included a number of stone caskets. Within the main hall of the crypts was a single sarcophagus, flanked on either side with gargoyle heads. These monstrous sculptures "breathed" bolts of fire upon the opening of the sarcophagus, within which was found the Watchers Guide spear.
Within a smaller chapel, set to the side of the central chamber was found the Book of Dead Gods.
At the rear of this hall were a set of large, heavy doors that opened up into the underground shrine to Jergal, set in front of a grand statue of the formerly-dead deity. Behind the statue was a smaller, secluded crypt sealed behind a hidden door. It was the resting place of Withers, an undead being whose origins were shrouded in mystery.

The deepest crypts of the temple were protected by the undead priests of Jergal. Disturbing the resting place of the Guardian of Tombs caused the skeletal devotees to rise up and defend the holy site.
In the , Gimblebock and his scavenger crew attempted to break into the lower level of the crypt, to no avail.
At around the same time, a mind flayer nautiloid crashed near the temples entrance. One of the crashs survivors, a cleric called Shadowheart tried to delve into the ruins, in order to find supplies and possible aid.
