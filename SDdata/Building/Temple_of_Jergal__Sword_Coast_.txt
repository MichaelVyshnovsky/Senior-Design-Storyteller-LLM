The '''temple of Jergal''' on the [[Sword Coast]] was a ruined temple-crypt dedicated to the [[Jergal|Lord of the Dead]], one of few of its kind found throughout [[Faer√ªn]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate}}

==Location==
It was located the north bank of the [[River Chionthar]], close to the border of [[Elturgard]].

==Structure==
The temple and crypts were built into the side of a cliff that overlooked the river. While the ground-level architecture was largely in ruin, the underground chambers remained relatively intact.

==Interior==

The upper level of the temple comprised a series of large rooms set into a row, including a feasting hall, a central chamber, and bunkrooms.

Beneath that was the temple's crypts, which included a number of stone caskets. Within the main hall of the crypts was a single sarcophagus, flanked on either side with gargoyle heads. These monstrous sculptures "breathed" bolts of fire upon the opening of the sarcophagus, within which was found ''[[the Watcher's Guide]]'' spear.

Within a smaller chapel, set to the side of the central chamber was found the ''[[Book of Dead Gods]]''.

At the rear of this hall were a set of large, heavy doors that opened up into the underground shrine to Jergal, set in front of a grand statue of the formerly-dead deity. Behind the statue was a smaller, secluded crypt sealed behind a hidden door. It was the resting place of [[Withers]], an [[undead]] being whose origins were shrouded in mystery.

==Defenses==

The deepest crypts of the temple were protected by the [[undead]] priests of Jergal. Disturbing the resting place of the Guardian of Tombs caused the skeletal devotees to rise up and defend the holy site.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Gimblebock]] and his scavenger crew attempted to break into the lower level of the crypt, to no avail.

At around the same time, a [[mind flayer]] [[nautiloid]] crashed near the temple's entrance. One of the crash's survivors, a [[cleric]] called [[Shadowheart]] tried to delve into the ruins, in order to find supplies and possible aid.
