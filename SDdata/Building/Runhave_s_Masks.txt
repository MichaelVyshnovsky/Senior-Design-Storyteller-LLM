Runhaves Masks was a festhall and tavern in the Amnian city of Esmeltaran during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The festhall was found in northeastern Esmeltaran.
The place provided quite excellent services at surprisingly cheap prices. The staff wore masks as they worked, and on occasion drugged, kidnapped, and sold foreign guests to drow who operated beneath the city.
