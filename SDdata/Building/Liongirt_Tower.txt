'''Liongirt Tower''' was the home of [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]], a [[Magister]] during the 4th century [[DR]].

==Location==
The tower was located in the capital of [[Lapaliiya]], [[Sheirtalar]].

==Description==
Walled gardens surrounded the tower. Hungry [[lion]]s prowled the gardens at all times.

==Defenses==
Liongirt Tower was guarded by many magical wards, as dozens of unfortunate wizards discovered when they tried to raid the tower after Onsilur's disappearance. Hidden ''[[teleport]]'' links and random spell-triggers were scattered throughout the tower. The entire tower actually crumbled when the central library was finally breached.
