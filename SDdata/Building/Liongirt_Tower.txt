Liongirt Tower was the home of Onsilur Maerdrathom, a Magister during the 4th century DR.
The tower was located in the capital of Lapaliiya, Sheirtalar.
Walled gardens surrounded the tower. Hungry lions prowled the gardens at all times.
Liongirt Tower was guarded by many magical wards, as dozens of unfortunate wizards discovered when they tried to raid the tower after Onsilurs disappearance. Hidden teleport links and random spell-triggers were scattered throughout the tower. The entire tower actually crumbled when the central library was finally breached.
