The '''Temple of Waukeen''' was the only temple dedicated to the Merchant's Friend, [[Waukeen]] in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|''Why is there a Temple of Waukeen here? I thought Neverwinter was more closely associated with Tyr?''|[[Priestess]] [[Alanna]]}}

==Structure==
The Temple of Waukeen was a large domed structure decorated with golden statues of the goddess. It was erected in [[Tyr's Eye]] – the elevated district by the [[Castle Never]], across the street from another recent addition – Neverwinter's [[Thayan enclave (Neverwinter)|Thayan enclave]], neighboring a trade outpost, and the [[Wailing Wench Tavern]].

==Interior==
The temple opened into a spacious chapel with the shrine dedicated to the Merchant's Friend in front of pew rows. The interior was decorated with fanciful pastries, statues, and gold-and-red carpets. That was one of the two major sections of the temple's first floor. The second section was a collection of offices from where major trade cartels of Neverwinter operated out of. The offices were located to the left of the temple's main entrance. As of 1374 DR, three mercantile cartels were authorized to do business out of the church: the [[Circle of Friends]], the [[Forgotten Lords]], and the [[Fated Winds]]. Each cartel was given an office in the temple; at the time, there were only three.

==Services==
All divine services provided by the church were done in the chapel by [[Manycoins]] [[Eramus]] personally. The Manycoins also accepted meetings in an official capacity on behalf of his church.

==History==
{{quote|''But even the city of the Even-Handed can still appreciate a helping hand from the Merchant's Friend - especially when it is in such dire need! This holy site is not meant to displace grand [[Tyr]], but to bring Waukeen's smile to Neverwinter, spurring badly-needed commerce''|Priestess Alanna}}<br/>
The Temple of Waukeen was a new addition to the city of Neverwitner, opened shortly after the end of the [[Shadow War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}} by a personal invitation from Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]]. A fire raged across the Tyr's Eye area of the city just after the Shadow War. The fires burned down what used to be a mages' school as well as several other buildings. The remnants of the school became the foundation of the Temple of Waukeen, one of the first public buildings opened in Tyr's Eye after the fire, above the [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]]. The short but devastating war damaged the [[Northwest Faerûn]]'s trade, and the [[Church of Waukeen]] was obliged to aid in financial recovery, sponsoring mercantile organizations trading out of Neverwinter. The Church of Waukeen did not seek to usurp the worship in the city, and the [[Church of Tyr]] welcomed Waukeen's aid feeling no threat from the new religion.
