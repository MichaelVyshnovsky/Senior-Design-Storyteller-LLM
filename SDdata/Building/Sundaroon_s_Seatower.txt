Sundaroons Seatower, also known as the Seawall, was a fortified spire located in the Seaglimpse neighborhood of Ravens Bluff. The Seatower gained its name from Sundaroons Wharf, the dock that joined the seafront fortress to Raven Way, in the Harbor District, west of the Gates of the Watchful Raven.
The Seatower contained a number of naval defenses, including heavy catapults, fire shot soaked with oil and stone balls linked with chain. The top of the tower also featured an area where griffons or other aerial mounts could land.
Prior to the War with Myrkyssa Jelan, in the year 1370 DR,  Sundaroons Seatower housed the Ravenian navy.
