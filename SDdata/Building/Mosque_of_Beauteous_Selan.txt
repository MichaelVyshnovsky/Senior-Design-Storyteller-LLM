The '''Mosque of Beauteous Selan''' was located in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Location==
This temple could be found in the [[Pilgrims' District]] of the City of Delights.

==Structure==
Since [[Selan]]'s worship was centered in [[Afyal]], her mosque in Huzuz was one of the smaller houses of the [[Zakharan pantheon|great gods]] of [[Zakhara]].

Many of Selan's followers were gardeners and artists, making her mosque truly beautiful. Hanging plants and flowers decorated the temple walls.

==Inhabitants==
High Priest Imam [[Lelia]] was the head of the mosque. She supervised over 200 lesser ranking priests of Selan and other laymen.

==Activities==
Skilled musicians contributed to Selan's religious ceremonies. Each month, during the full [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]], the dome of the mosque would turn transparent. The moonlight flowing inside was concentrated on the main worship area, engulfing a statue of a pear tree. The statue would blossom and flower before releasing its fruit. The fruit would float off of the tree, touching followers gathered for the ceremony. All those who were touched received a blessing of Selan, increasing their artistic ability. The effects of this blessing lasted until the next full moon.
