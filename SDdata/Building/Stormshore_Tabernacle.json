You have entered the Stormshore Tabernacle. Here, clerics may commune with their gods - and even hear their responses if they are so favored. I am also granted the power to provide holy resurrection through sales of revivification scrolls.|Vicar Humbletoes}}",
        "Location": "The Stormshore Tabernacle stood on [[Stormshore Street]] in the Lower City, west of the [[Basilisk Gate]].",
        "Interior": "[[File:Idol of mystra.png|thumb|''A stature above the shrine to [[Mystra]].''|290x290px]]\nThe Tabernacle was a square building with a high ceiling. A large lit brasier was lit at the chamber's center with shrines and statues to [[Helm]], [[Tyr]], [[Selûne]], and [[Mystra]] placed witin wall alcoves, separated by bookshelves filled with religious works and texts. Opposite of the temple's main entrance stood the ''Statue of the Gods'' – a generic sculpture that served as a shrine to all other gods.\n\nUnderneath the temple, one could find its basement – a magically trapped vault where the Tabernacle kept its donations and some powerful [[enchanted]] trinkets, such as a ''[[shield of shielding]]'', ''[[Hammer of the Just]]'', and the ''[[Amulet of the Devout]]'' from [[Oerth]]. Looting the vast with the donations was sure to incur multiple deities' wrath.",
        "Services": "[[File:Stormshore Tabernacle interior.jpg|thumb|''Stormshore Tabernacle interior.''|395x395px]]\nThe visitors to the Stormshore Tabernacle were greeted by its vicar, who offered religious ceremonies, temple series, and places of worship, as well as had divine relics, curatives, and [[scroll]]s for sale. Those who sought to be ''[[blessed]]'' by a deity had to leave a significant offering on the deity's shrine.",
        "History": "The Stormshore Tabernacle was run by [[gnome|gnomish]] vicar [[Humbletoes]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. In 1492 DR, the Tabernacle received hefty donations from worshipers of Helm (50,000 [[gp]], nine heads of [[cattle]], many [[gemstone]]s, and sixteen severed eyes despite the temple greatly discouraged the donation of viscera) and of Selûne (47,000 gp, a shipment of [[enchanted]] [[lamp]]s, parlor [[mirror]]s of [[alabaster]], wrought [[iron]], and [[silver]], and a huge number of [[candle]]s. Thanks to these massive donations, The Stormshore Tabernacle commissioned a statue shrine to the bountiful [[Tymora]], the Lady Luck."
