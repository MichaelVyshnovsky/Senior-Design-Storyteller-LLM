        "mainbody": "The '''Crypt of Kesefehon''' was one of many crypts located in the [[Polyandrium]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. The final resting place of [[Kesefehon]], the crypt was one of few undisturbed by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Location": "The Crypt of Kesefehon was located in Polyandrium, a cemetery in Myth Drannor, surrounded by many other crypts and tombs. All structures in the area were magically locked and were overlooked by the [[Tower of Bones]].\n[[File:Crypt of Kesefehon - polyandrium.png|thumb|266x266px|''The location of the Crypt of Kesefehon inÂ Polyandrium.'']]",
        "Structure": "The structure was mostly underground with an entrance to the crypt being above ground.",
        "Interior": "The staircase that led inside the tomb opened up into a Hall of Statues at its end. The Hall was a long rectangular passage with a stone door at the far end of the hallway, and a smaller door in a tiny alcove on the left. The Hall of Statues was named after six large statues of [[elf]] warriors, three males, and three females. The statues were placed along the walls of the hall facing each other, with ''continual flame'' spell liting up the room from behind each.\n\nThe alcove door on the western side of the hall opened into a collapsed hall. Right across from it, on the eastern side was a hidden door that led to Kesefehon's tomb. The door at the end of the Hall of Statues led to a smaller passage that was trapped and led to the Tapestry Chamber.\n\nThe Tapestry Chamber was a small room decorated with six well-preserved beautiful and expensive tapestries depicting Kesefehon in his glory days slaying demons and orcs. Each tapestry could be valued at 450 [[gp]].\n\nPast the Tapestry Chamber laid the flooded decoy Crypt, past a short stairway down. The room had cold dirty water seep through the walls over the centuries. The room held two ''continual flames'' enchanted torches and a sarcophagus decorated with engravings of elf hunters and wolves. Inside, a poisonous gas cloud was trapped along with a non-undead skeleton wearing mundane [[breastplate]] and holding a non-magical [[longsword]].\n\nThe true tomb of Kesefehon laid in the Hall of Statues behind an immaculately hidden secret door. The had a strong aroma of flowers emanating from six [[ceramic]] jars filled with several gallons of thick tar-like liquid. The fragrant liquid was the precious ointment that Kesefehon's followers used to soothe his pain and rage when he was alive. The true sarcophagus was placed in the center of the room, engraved with an image of a [[wolf]], elven script, and decorative patterns.",
        "Defenses": "The Crypt of Kesefehon's entrance, like many other locations in Myth Drannor, was protected by a ''rune'' and a ''word of power''. This crypt was locked by the ''rune of the wolf'' and the word \"haturran\".\n\nThe Hall of Statues was decorated with fierce elven warriors, each enchanted with a ''[[glyph of warding]]''. Each ''glyph'' discharged a blast of ''lightning'' when something stepped in front of the statues. The ''glyphs'' recharged their magic and were ready to fry intruders once a day.\n\nThe hallway that led to the Tapestry Chamber was trapped as well, the spears were ready to skewer intruders were activated by a pressure plate at the hall's entrance, and upon the door's to the next chamber opening. The spears were coated in [[giant wasp poison]].\n\nThe flooded Crypt was a decoy, a trap for unwitting graverobbers. The sarcophagus' lid was sealed with [[wax]], trapping a cloud of deadly gas inside. Unlike other traps, this one could not be disarmed due to its non-mechanical nature.\n\nInside the true sarcophagus, Kesefehon himself was laid to rest. He himself was a defender of the crypt as the cause of his death also brought him back as a [[mummy]]. He attacked anyone who attempted to remove his magical armor or sword from his body. All traps in the crypt were not triggered by the mummy.",
        "History": "The tomb was built before the [[Weeping War]] after Kesefehon's death from an unknown disease. His followers buried him as a hero leaving traps behind to dissuade anyone from desecrating the place of his final rest.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Kesefehon's crypt was one of few that remained undisturbed by the occupying [[Cult of the Dragon]]. The members of the cult knew of the dangers inside and scribbled a warning message on the door in [[chalk]] to prevent anyone but [[Shamoor]] from entering."
