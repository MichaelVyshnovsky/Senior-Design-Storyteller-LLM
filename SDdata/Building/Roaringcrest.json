        "History": "Long time before the late 14{{th}} century DR, Roaringcrest was a pirate stronghold, until its destruction at the hands of the [[Twilight Three]], a trio of [[lich]]es from the isle of [[Thelve]]. The liches pelted the keep with spells that turned it into an area of ''[[wild magic]]''. After the pirate occupants, the ruins were home to [[crimson death]]s, [[darktentacles]] and [[automaton]]s. Even by the late 14{{th}} century DR, pirates of the Sea of Swords told stories of ancient buccaneer treasures hidden within Roaringcrest."
