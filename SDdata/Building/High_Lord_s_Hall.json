        "mainbody": "The High Lords Hall was a manor in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale. It was the seat of power of the High Lords that ruled the town.\nIt stood at the center of the city, north of the river, in the area known as High Town, above where the falls once were. It was the most notable landmark in the city. One of the Houses of Morning was nearby.\nIt was a walled manor house. The architecture was an odd mixture of southern Calishite and elven styles.\nThe High Lords Hall was built by members of the Rensha family during their rule of Loudwater.\nRumors told in the town, such as by the warehouse owner Agrath Dundai to Volothamp Geddarm sometime before 1366 DR, claimed that there was a crypt beneath the hall. It was supposedly haunted by undead, namely the remnants of former Rensha High Lords of Loudwater, and that some of them had experimented with dark magic."
