        "mainbody": "The '''High Lord's Hall''' was a manor in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]]. It was the seat of power of the High Lords that ruled the town.",
        "Location": "It stood at the center of the city, north of the river, in the area known as High Town, above where the falls once were. It was the most notable landmark in the city. One of the [[Houses of Morning]] was nearby.",
        "Description": "It was a walled manor house. The architecture was an odd mixture of southern [[Calishite]] and elven styles.",
        "History": "The High Lord's Hall was built by members of the [[Rensha]] family during their rule of Loudwater.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors told in the town, such as by the warehouse owner [[Agrath Dundai]] to [[Volothamp Geddarm]] sometime before [[1366 DR]], claimed that there was a crypt beneath the hall. It was supposedly haunted by [[undead]], namely the remnants of former Rensha High Lords of Loudwater, and that some of them had experimented with dark [[magic]]."
