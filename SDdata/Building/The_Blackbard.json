Its proprietor was [[Shanna Northgate|Shanna \"Blackbard\" Northgate]].\n\nThe facility was formerly a warehouse and wharf converted into a combination boat-building and rental storage business. It produced high-quality, seaworthy boats, but nothing bigger or grander than a large river barge.\n\nThe storage space could be rented for any purpose, was in its time used for holding captives, casting [[spell]]s, conducting experiments, and other illicit activities. Shanna Northgate asked no questions, ignored what went on, and revealed no secrets."
