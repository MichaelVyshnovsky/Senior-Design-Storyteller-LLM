        "mainbody": "The Blackbard was a boatyard and warehouse located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. Its proprietor was Shanna \"Blackbard\" Northgate.\nThe facility was formerly a warehouse and wharf converted into a combination boat-building and rental storage business. It produced high-quality, seaworthy boats, but nothing bigger or grander than a large river barge.\nThe storage space could be rented for any purpose, was in its time used for holding captives, casting spells, conducting experiments, and other illicit activities. Shanna Northgate asked no questions, ignored what went on, and revealed no secrets."
