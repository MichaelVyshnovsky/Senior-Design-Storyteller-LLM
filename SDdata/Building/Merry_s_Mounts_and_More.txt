Merrys Mounts and More was a stable in Halfhap. It was operated by the elf Merialeth Loriamanthor.
The stables housed and sold horses, ponies and livestock, as well as riding gear and other supplies. On rare occasions, Merialeth could obtain a young hippogriff and would only sell it to a trustworthy potential master.
