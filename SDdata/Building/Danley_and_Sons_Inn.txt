'''Danley and Sons Inn''' was the only inn tavern located in the resettled town of [[Phandalin]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Danley and Sons was a sparsely attended cheap and shabby inn.

==Atmosphere==
Despite being in a struggling community, Danley and Sons occasionally hosted traveling minstrels ''circa'' [[1374 DR]], namely the sweet-voiced duo of [[Shymon and Scarbunkel]], the [[bard]] infamous for his scandals and proclivities named [[Finch (half-elf)|Finch]], and once, even [[Grobnar Gnomehands]], who reportedly was terrible at singing.

==History==
Phandalin was resettled and Danley and Sons Inn was opened some years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. In 1374 DR, one of the village's inhabitants and a frequent customer of the inn, [[Danley]], assembled a group of tough veterans of the [[Shadow War]] to clean the [[cold iron]] mines off their monstrous humanoid inhabitants and resume the production. The plan came to a halt when two representatives of the so-called "Cold Mining Company" arrived in Phandalin and declared ownership of the mines, and cleared out orcs and other creatures who infested it. Danley could be found in Danley and Sons, drinking and looking for a group of daring adventurers willing to investigate the suspicious new organization.
