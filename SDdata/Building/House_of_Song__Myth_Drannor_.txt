The '''House of Song''' was a temple dedicated to the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] deity [[Oghma]] in the city of [[Myth Drannor]]. During the glory years of [[Cormanthyr]], it was considered to be the most bountiful library of musical works in the whole of the empire.

==Location==
It was located on the north side of Myth Drannor, in the [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Old City]] district.

==Structure==
The imposing temple was constructed like a fortress. Three of its floors stood above ground, with two more beneath them.

==Interior==
The entryway of the temple featured a grand spiral staircase, with steps that floated above one another circling towards the top floor.

Many chambers within the House of Song could only be accessed by those individuals capable of performing certain melodies.
