Thorp Villa was the family estate of the Waterdhavian noble house Thorp.
The villa was located in the central section of Waterdeeps North Ward on the eastern side of Vhezoar Street just south of Hassantyrs Street. The estate also sat in between Stabbed Sailor Alley, Sprangalars Swordcut, and the Street of the Manticore.
Four separate buildings within the walled compound were arranged around a central courtyard. All three buildings were three stories tall.
