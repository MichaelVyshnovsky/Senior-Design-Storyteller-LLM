        "mainbody": "he Temple of Mystra was a secret place of worship dedicated to Mystra in the Thayan city of Bezantur.\nThe small temple was located underground beneath an abandoned apartment building in western Bezantur. Several tunnels extended from the temple which could be used to quickly escape the city.\nThe temple served as a safe haven for the worship of Mystra, The underground complex also came to serve as a hiding place for other enemies of the Red Wizards, notably agents of the Harpers, escaped slaves, and political dissidents.\nThe temple was kept hidden by powerful wards maintained by the temples High Priestess. In addition, a vision of Mystra watched over the temple, and was believed by the faithful to be a manifestation of her divine power that kept the temple safe.\nPrior to the Time of Troubles, the earlier incarnation of Mystra was openly venerated in Thay, although her worship was generally restricted to only Red Wizards and their entourages. During this time, Bezantur boasted the largest Thayan temple in her honor, although it was subordinate to a temple in Eltabbar. However, following the events of the Time of Troubles in the &mdashwhen Mystras mantle was taken up by Midnight&mdashher worship became outlawed in the City of a Thousand Temples in a bid by the Red Wizards to limit access to arcane magic outside of their own organization. By the late 1360s DR, the church of Mystra operated mainly out of this hidden underground complex.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the temple and its wards were overseen by High Priestess Dolare."
