Helvenblade House was a country estate owned by the noble Silmerhelve family of Waterdeep.
It was located west of the Long Road at the border of Kryptgarden Forest, northwest of Westbridge.
The estate comprised the manor house, stables, two hunting lodges, and a third guest lodge. It featured a bountiful vegetable garden and vast hunting grounds.
As of the early 1490s DR, the Silmerhelve family visited Helvenblade House about a half a dozen times a year.
Local legend stated that Helvenblade House was protected by what was perceived as the Silmerhelve family ghost. This guardian spirit was in fact the bronze dragon Umsheryoth, a long-time ally of the Waterdhavian family.
The noble estate was maintained by a staff of caretakers that lived on the grounds year-round.
