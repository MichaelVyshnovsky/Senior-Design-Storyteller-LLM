        "mainbody": "The '''Mariners' Alliance''' was a guildhall in [[Daggerford]] that served the town's many sailors, boatmen and other seafarers.\n\n{{quote|''They're a good bunch of swabbies, if a bit shy and secretive 'round strangers. If ya ever want to cozy up to one of 'em, just feed 'em booze... lots and lots of booze. Those lads and lasses really love their [[Harbor Bottom Whisky]].''|[[Bill O'Shaughnessy]]}}",
        "Location": "It was located in the town's [[Riverman's Quarter]]{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "Interior": "The building itself was full of sea charts and nautical maps. It had boarding rooms for members of the guild that were staying in town.\n\nThe sub-level of the guildhall was used as private meeting rooms, warehouse storage, and the guild's record-keeping.",
        "Activities": "The hall was a great place to find work aboard a shop or other naval vessel. Only guild members were allowed to solicit employment in this manner.\n\nThe Mariners' Alliance controlled shipping permits which allowed them to keep tabs on all trade done by sea in Daggerford.",
        "Notable Members": "*[[Bill O'Shaughnessy]] - an older pirate captain and a mariner who once was a loyal member of the Alliance.\n*[[Taffy]] - a hulking man that could be found guarding the guildhall's meeting room in [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "In [[1372 DR]] , Mariners' Alliance stoke an extremely profitable trading deal via [[Shoreside Shipping Consortium]], trading along the [[Delimbiyr River]]. The trading vessel called ''[[Barracuda (ship)|Barracuda]]'' was involved in regular shippings of weapons and armor that passed through Daggerford. Suspiciously enough, ''Barracuda's'' final destination was omitted from the logs kept in Mariners' Alliance guildhall.\n\nThat information became available to the group of adventurers guided by [[Astriel Shalyn]] in investigating recent threats against the city of Daggerford. The adventurers investigated the guildhall, eventually recovering the thick ledger that led them to the ''Barracuda'', and eventually, to discover the Mariners' Alliance treacherous deal with the [[Zhentarim]], accepting shipments of weapon and armor, passing them through the city and shipping them to the growing [[orc]] horde, all part of the complex plan to take over the city's government."
