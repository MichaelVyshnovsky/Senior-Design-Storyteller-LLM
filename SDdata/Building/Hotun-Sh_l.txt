'''Hotun-Shûl''' was a large, underground [[giant]] temple beneath the [[Ice Spires]].

==Description==
The walls of Hotun-Shûl were roughly {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} wide and tall, with the topmost {{SI|10|ft}} being{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|9}} lined with hundreds of friezes that depicted the history and accomplishments of the giants.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|5, 8, 17}} The friezes also depicted the history of their chief giant deity [[Annam All-Father]] and his progeny,{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|5, 8}} such as his retribution against [[Ulutiu]].

Three rooms in the temple were dedicated to the three most important runes of the giants, representing the cycle of life and death.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|17}} Each of these rooms were lined with friezes that depicted the [[giant language]], along with a [[common]] translation beneath them.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|15-16, 19}}

In the centuries following its destruction, many areas within the temple became [[wild magic]] and [[dead-magic zone]]s.
===Interior===
'''Rotunda:''' the temple's central rotunda was {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} wide, with a glass domed ceiling that reached just as high. In the center of the room was a {{SI|60|ft}} tall statue of a kneeling giant, with large carved [[diamond]]s for eyes; the statue was a depiction of [[Illsenstaad]] paying his respects to the ancestors of all giant-kind. In the statue's right hand was held high a bowl of blue flames, while in its left was a {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} wooden pole capped with short, [[iron]] spikes engraved with the rune ''Haug'' (hill). This pole was enchanted to gift its wielder the strength of a [[hill giant]], but it would permanently lose this enchantment if removed. Only by rotating this statue to face the north could the rotunda's barred concave door be opened.

'''Hall of the All-Father:''' directly outside the rotunda was a hall lined with friezes that depicted Annam All-Father's arrival to [[Faerûn]], his marriage to [[Othea]], and the birth of his children. In the center was a {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} wide fresco of a white-haired, blue-robed giant with [[fire opal]]s for eyes. Anyone that attempted to steal these opals would be crushed beneath a {{SI|10|ft}} block of stone.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|13}}

'''Halls of the Progenitors and Afterlife:''' the area west of this hall was lined with friezes that depicted the progenitors of the various giant races, including [[Arno and Julian]] and [[Vaprak]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|21}}

'''Hall of the Hartkiller:''' the hall of the progenitors led into a room whose friezes depicted the story of [[Hartkiller]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|14}}

'''Unfinished Hall:''' the hall of the afterlife led into a room that was still being constructed when the temple was destroyed. It was a largely featureless space, full of piles of decayed scaffolding and stone carving tools fit for a giant. The friezes in it were incomplete, only covering a third of the room, and depicted the history of the [[ettin]]s and [[cyclopes]]. The room extended out to two other rooms, but one of these halls became blocked following the temple's destruction.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|20}}

'''Hall of the Trolls:''' one of the rooms that the unfinished hall connected to was lined with carvings that depicted a cruel, black-skinned giant who is cursed to live forever, standing atop a pile of his own limbs. In the center of the room was a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} black obelisk adorned with a wide variety of [[gemstone]]s. Anyone who attempted to steal these gemstones would activate a spell of ''[[reverse gravity]]'', surely killing them.

'''Hall of Death:''' the other room that the unfinished hall once connected to was one of the three ''master rune'' rooms. The word friezes that lined its walls cataloged the time, place, and manner of death for thousands of giants. In the center of the room laid a crude chunk of [[obsidian]] that depicted a giant holding ''Dod'', the giant rune that represented "death." The giant is shown casting light from the rune down upon a group of dead animals and plants, while other giants stand aside aghast at the sight.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|19}}

'''Hall of Life:''' the hall of hartkiller led into one of the three ''master rune'' rooms. Its walls had thousands of crystals embedded into them and word friezes that documented the births of thousands of giants, as well as where they lived. In the center of the room was a large slab of [[alabaster]] that depicted a giant holding ''Liv'', the giant rune that represented "life." Basking in its radiance around him were animals, flowering plants, and younger giants.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|14-15}}

'''Hall of Journey:''' adjacent to the hall of the ordning and the hall of the seven stones was one of the three ''master rune'' rooms. The word friezes that lined its walls documented giant accomplishments across the ages, such as [[frost giant]] victories, revelations made by [[stone giant]]s, and great things forged by [[fire giant]]s. In the center of the room stood a perfectly-square slab of forged iron that depicted a giant hammering upon ''Ferd'', the giant rune that represented "journey," on a glowing red [[anvil]].{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|16}}

'''Illsenstaad's Chambers:''' one the friezes in the hall of journey had a secret sliding mechanism that revealed the living quarters of the master stone giant artisan Illsenstaad, whose bones could be found piled in a corner centuries after the temple's destruction. Every surface of the chamber was etched with a wide variety of engravings - writings, pictures, and geometric designs.

'''Hall of the Ordning:''' the hall of life led into a room lined with friezes that depicted Annam growing increasingly weary of his progeny's bickering, until finally creating the Ordning. At this final moment his six children are shown hanging their heads in shame.

'''Hall of the Seven Stones:''' the hall of journey led into a room with a carving on its southern wall that reached up higher than any carving in the temple. It depicted a tall, thin [[Obadai]] instructing a circle of seven stone giants to contemplate the surface world; it represented the [[Seven Stones]] enclave. Six of the giants each express a different emotion, while a thin seventh giant watches over his peers whilst leaning upon a cane.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|18}}

==History==
The countless friezes in Hotun-Shûl were carved by Illsenstaad, who had been charged by his father Obadai with documenting the history and accomplishments of the giants. Prior to its destruction the temple was a place of learning and it was in its halls that the first [[runecaster]]s among the giants learned their magic.

Around the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], 400 years prior to [[1366 DR]],{{Giantcraft date}} the temple was ransacked, by a group of [[grimlock]]s with [[Earth (element)|earth]] magic and [[earth elemental|elementals]]. However, the grimlocks' involvement in the temple's destruction would be unknown for centuries.

At some point prior to its destruction, [[Skrom Jek]] of [[Thay]] wrote a book on the temple entitled, ''[[The Meanderings Upon the Friezes of Hotun-Shûl]]''.

In the centuries that followed its destruction the [[ghost]] of Illensenstaad worked tirelessly to carve runes into the statue that laid in the temple's central rotunda, eventually transforming it into a [[rune-forged guardian]] to protect his temple.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|22}}

Around the late 15{{th}} DR, seismic activity caused the temple to become unearthed. This attracted the attention of many [[drow]], grimlocks, and giants around the Ice Spires region.{{Cite adventurers league/Forgotten Traditions|11}}
