'''Derval's Bright Blade''' was a weapon-smithy in [[Daggerford]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 1360s DR, owned by the [[dwarf]] master smith [[Derval Ironeater]].

==Reputation==
Of the smithies in town, Derval's was the best and largest, and certainly better than [[Cromach]] and [[Wayfel]]. His work was much sought after by fighters, and considered the best anywhere between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Waterdeep]]. Derval would say so himself.

==Location==
It lay in Daggerford's [[Money Quarter]] on the [[High Road]], between [[Kryptgarden Scrolls]] and Cromach's house, and behind the [[Jewelers' Congress]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Structure==
It was a large building, with pale-brown walls and roof tiles and gabled dormers on the attic level.

The sign that hung above the entrance to Derval's store was decorated with a branded image of an [[anvil]] on the sign's wood. The sign was unkept but its design showed meticulous skill.

The backyard of the smithy was full of [[tool]]s that [[Ironeater]] [[dwarves]] had created and used for stone construction projects around Daggerford over the years.

==Services==
At the smithy, Derval focused on weaponry, forging [[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[spear]] heads. His prices were high compared to other weaponsmiths.

==History==
Derval's Bright Blade was well established by [[1367 DR]], and still going strong through [[1370 DR]].
