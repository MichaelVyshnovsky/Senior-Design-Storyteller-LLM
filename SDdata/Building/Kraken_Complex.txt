The '''Kraken Complex''' was a large building in [[Yartar]], and the local base of the [[Kraken Society]].

==Structure==
The complex was built to resemble a [[kraken]], a massive [[magical beast]] from the sea.

==Interior==
The central part of the inner chamber was a huge aquarium filled with murky water. The walls of the corridors, which were essentially large panes of glass, were transparent enough to see several [[squid]] moving about.

The southwest room of the building housed a huge library, with several books and tomes. The books featured different aspects of the [[Realms]], and some had very unusual alphabets and languages.

Kraken spies, [[giant frog]]s, and [[lizardmen]] roamed the halls.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be saved [[Amelior Amanitas]] from the makeshift torture chamber of the [[Zhentarim]] in [[Everlund]]. The Kraken Society allied with the Zhentarim, and were tasked with hunting down the heroes, to stop them further getting in the way of their grand scheme. Thus, the society set up the complex in Yartar, and worked on making a distraction for the heroes. When the adventuring party journeyed back to Yartar, they approached the gates, but found it was blocked by a wagon and a herd of sheep. Members of the society surprised the adventurers and dragged them to the main complex.

The heroes were thrown to the floor, and looked up to see [[Vaalgamon]], the [[evil]] Zhentarim general. He laughed at the heroes, derided them, and left them to be wiped out by the Krakens. Despite Vaalgamon's confidence, the adventurers made their way to the local Kraken captain's office, then killed him and his lackeys, then escaped.
