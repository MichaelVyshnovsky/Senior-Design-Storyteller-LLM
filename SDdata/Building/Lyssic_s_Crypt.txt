All throughout the crypt, ancient officer bodies that remained undisturbed were sure to rise in defense of their final resting place.
The Commanders Crypt in the flooded level was guarded by two statues, one of a human, other of an elf. Once the tomb was unlocked, both statues became animated and morphed into monstrous shape attacking anyone who attempted to pass them. The only way of protection against the monstrous statues was wearing two magical rings, hidden somewhere in Lyssics Crypt.
This military crypt was constructed and started seeing use before the fall of Myth Drannor in the Weeping War. At first, it was used to inter people who fell in combat under the command of Lyssic. Eventually, Lyssic himself perished and his body was placed in the tombs mausoleum. after this, the crypt became known as Lyssics Crypt.
Unlike many of the crypts in Polyandrium, Lyssics final resting place was disturbed in 1368 DR. A group of adventurers went inside and never left, leaving the gates wide open and propped by a boulder. Sometime after the crypt was unsealed, an earthquake stroke the Polyandrium and crumbled the stature of the knight above the entrance. In 1369 DR, Lyssic tomb was once again disturbed, this time by the agents of the Cult of the Dragon who took over the ruins of myth drannor. The Cult planned on excavating Lyssics Crypt but a group of adventurers who sought to defeat the cult beat them to it, recovering the rune of stars - the key to the Crypt of Rothilion.
It was believed by the folk of Myth Drannor that Lyssic one day would rise from his grave to defend the City of Song in death at the time of great peril. This, however never happened even though some of commanders troops rose as undead to avenge their deaths to punish unlucky graverobbers.
