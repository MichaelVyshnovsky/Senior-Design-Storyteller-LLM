        "mainbody": "The Hawk Man was one of the colossal Walking Statues of Waterdeep located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep. Since its creation, the statue was hollowed out and officially became known as Sparaunt Tower and was occupied by several wealthy residents.\nThis winged statue bore the head of a hawk. The right arm and the left foot were broken up for building material and the statue was hollowed out to form the Sparaunt Tower. The tower was accessed via a bell in the courtyard after it was rung, a door guard lowered a rope ladder for residents or invited guests.\nDuring the Spellplague, in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR, the walking statue became animated and rampaged through the city. When it stopped, its left arm was extended northward, palm up, in the \"stop\" position."
