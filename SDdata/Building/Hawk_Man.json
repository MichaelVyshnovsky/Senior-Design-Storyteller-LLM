        "mainbody": "The '''Hawk Man''' was one of the colossal [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] located in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Since its creation, the statue was hollowed out and officially became known as '''Sparaunt Tower''' and was occupied by several wealthy residents.",
        "Description": "This winged statue bore the head of a [[hawk]]. The right arm and the left foot were broken up for building material and the statue was hollowed out to form the Sparaunt Tower. The tower was accessed via a [[bell]] in the courtyard: after it was rung, a door guard lowered a [[rope ladder]] for residents or invited guests.",
        "History": "During the [[Spellplague]], in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], the walking statue became animated and rampaged through the city. When it stopped, its left arm was extended northward, palm up, in the \"stop\" position."
