'''Eagleshield Fine Horse Leathers''' was a high-end tack and harness shop found in [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was run by the [[Eagleshield]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
It was a large, professionally run establishment shop staffed by young men of friendly demeanor. The shop only catered to [[adventurer]]s and the ridiculously rich.

==Services==
The shop sold [[saddle]]s, reins, and so on for single riders. It also sold [[whip]]s and [[leather]] [[breeches]], but not [[boot]]s. It had a great variety of goods on offer, all of high quality and suitably expensive. For its wealthiest clients, Eagleshield Fine Leathers produced custom-made pieces, while its off-the-peg pieces were still very costly.
