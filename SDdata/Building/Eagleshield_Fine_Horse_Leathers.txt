Eagleshield Fine Horse Leathers was a high-end tack and harness shop found in Amphail in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was run by the Eagleshield noble family of Waterdeep.
It was a large, professionally run establishment shop staffed by young men of friendly demeanor. The shop only catered to adventurers and the ridiculously rich.
The shop sold saddles, reins, and so on for single riders. It also sold whips and leather breeches, but not boots. It had a great variety of goods on offer, all of high quality and suitably expensive. For its wealthiest clients, Eagleshield Fine Leathers produced custom-made pieces, while its off-the-peg pieces were still very costly.
