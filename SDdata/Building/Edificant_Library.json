        "mainbody": "century DR\nThe Edificant Library was a temple and library located in the south of the Snowflake Mountains in Erlkazar.\nThe building was an massive stone structure as strong as a fortress, with its walls wreathed in ivy. The huge building was more than 400 feet (120 meters) across and at least 200 feet (60 meters) high. It consisted of four above-ground levels and had an unknown expanse of storage tunnels and catacombs below. The first floor contained the library proper with unnumbered collections of mostly unique and ancient books, parchments, and artifacts. The second floor contained smaller study chambers and guest rooms for visiting scholars. It was built as a self-contained town, complete with housing, guest quarters, a large eating hall, stables, along with alchemy and herbalist shops.\nThe Library was erected as a tribute to Deneir and Oghma, the allied gods of knowledge, literature, and art.\nThe Edificant Library was open to all who wished to learn on the condition that they did not plan to use their knowledge for baneful purposes. Thus no scholars of evil religions were allowed entry to the Library. Followers of Gond were not well looked upon either, for they often strove for knowledge indifferent to its evil nature. The Library was a place for study, reading poetry, painting, sculpting, and for debate about all types of deep questions.\nConstruction of the library began during the reign of Amahl Shoon V (142–204 DR) of the Shoon Imperium, and the \"Artist Qysar\" donated great funds into the project. The Edificant Library of the 1300s DR had stood for some six centuries.At its first appearance in Canticle, the Edificant Library is said to be 600 years old as of 1361 DR. However, Empires of the Shining Sea dates its construction to the 2 century DR, making it around 1200 years old. To reconcile these, it seems likely the Edificant Library was rebuilt at a later date.\nBut the Chaos Curse was the downfall of the Library, in the . In Kierkan Rufos assault on the Library, every priest and headmaster died—either at the hands of former student turned vampire Kierkan Rufo as the embodiment of the Chaos Curse and then being raised as zombies, or by giving into the dark promises of being a vampire at Rufos side. They were ultimately put to eternal rest by Cadderly Bonaduce. All priests were affected by Kierkan Rufo, except Vicero Belago, the librarys alchemist, who was sent away from the Library by Dean Thobicus long before Rufo desecrated the holy place, and Brother Chaunticleer, whose melodies to the patron deities warded him against the evil that befell the library. Chaunticleers room was the only place in the building that had not been desecrated, leaving him half starved and his hair whitened from the terror he had endured until Cadderly Bonaduce and his friends finally killed Rufo.\nCadderly Bonaduce finally destroyed the desecrated building with the help of his god-given powers, wiping the Edificant Library from the landscape. Then, again with the help of Deneir, Cadderly started to construct a new cathedral in the librarys stead, Spirit Soaring.\n* Cadderly Bonaduce\n* Danica Maupoissant\n* Pikel Bouldershoulder\n* Ivan Bouldershoulder\n* Kierkan Rufo\n* Pertelope\n* Avery Schell\n* Chaunticleer"
