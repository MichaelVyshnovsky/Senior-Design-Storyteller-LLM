'''House of Song''' was the guildhall of the [[Guilds of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian guild]] known as the [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers]].

==Location==
The House of Song was located along [[Rivon Street]], or on the corner of [[Coach Lamp Lane]] and [[Carter's Way]], close to the South Gate, in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Structure==
This guildhall was a large, two-story building.

===Interior===
The interior parlor's ceiling was supported by a series of slender stone pillars; two adjacent columns were pale blue in color. The woodwork where the wall met the ceiling was inscribed with an old [[elf|elven]] song. The interior featured a kitchen with a back entrance, where a small team of dedicated cooks worked.<ref>{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|11-12}}

At some point inside the building there were two pale blue columns, between which an old [[elven]] tune was etched near the ceiling.

==Activities==
In addition to hosting all guild business, the House of Song provided food and beds for its members, including itinerant [[bard]]s.{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|25}}

==History==
The House of Song lay on the former site of [[Olamn]], an old bardic college.

The House was Song was established some time before [[1357 DR]], and continued through [[1368 DR]] and past the end of [[1372 DR]].

==Secrets==
A few guildmembers could recall a visitor coming in, practicing an instrument in the parlor, then not being seen again, and presumed them to have simply departed unannounced and unobserved. In fact, if the tune etched into the woodwork of the parlor was played, a ''[[gate]]'' opened between the pale-blue columns there, large enough to take four people at once. It led to [[Wyllowwood]] in [[Undermountain]], depositing them into a river inhabited by [[sea hag]]s. This ''gate'' and its deadly destination were completely unknown to the guildmembers.
