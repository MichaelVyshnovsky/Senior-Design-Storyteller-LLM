        "mainbody": "he Five Lions was an inn in the realm of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nAn isolated inn, it stood on a side-trail a little way beyond the lip of the Allascar valley and on the steep slope down to the great Faraway forest.\nIt was considered quaint.\nAs well as being an inn, it was the base of operations and the namesake of an adventuring company, the Five Lions. They provided training to young adventurers.\nDuring the Ten Black Days of Eleint in the , several members of the royal family escaped Tethyr and somehow made it to The Five Lions inn. However, they were followed by rebels, who killed them in the woods.Polyhedron #98 only says \"When strife came to Tethyr...\" Its presumed this refers to the triggering event, rather than the following two strife-filled decades of the Tethyrian Interregnum. The history of the Ten Black Days implies all the royal family were killed in the castle fire, but it is known that many nobles escaped to Amn. Thus, it is likely these were royal-related nobles.\nThese events gave rise to a rumor that, within the cellars of The Five Lions inn, there was a permanent gate of great age that connected to some hidden location in Amn. It was supposed both the fleeing royals and the pursuing rebels had found and gained access to this gate."
