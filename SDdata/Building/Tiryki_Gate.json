It connected the interior [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] to the exterior district of [[Port Nyanzaru/Tiryki Anchorage|Tiryki Anchorage]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|4}}",
        "Description": "Pedestrians who entered through the gate from Tiryki Anchorage to the Market Ward had to ascend a set of stairs. In doing so, they were said to escape the stench of [[dinosaur]] dung and refuse into the finer fragrances of inner Port Nyanzaru.",
        "Defenses": "The ramparts atop the gate afforded a clear view of Tiryki Anchorage at least as far as the outlying dinosaur pens.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|10}} In cases of attack, a [[horn]] would be sounded to signal for the people of Tiryki Anchorage to flee through Tiryki Gate to the safety of the walls. However, the gate would also be locked to protect the wards inside the city, and so those who lived outside had to be quick.{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|12}}",
        "History": "During [[dinosaur races]], the area of the Market Ward just inside the gate was a hangout for bookies and gamblers. Tiryki Gate sometimes served as the starting and finishing point for such events,{{Cite adventurers league/A Day at the Races|6}} The [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] of the city would stand atop the gate to congratulate race winners.\n\nDuring the events of the [[death curse]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Tiryki Gate was breached by the forces of the [[devil|infernal]] pirate captain [[Idrianne Smoke]].{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|4}}{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|24}}"
