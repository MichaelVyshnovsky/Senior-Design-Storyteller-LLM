        "mainbody": "The Baths of Persepolis were a ruin in Medinat Muskawoon.\nThese baths were one of the first bathhouses to be built in the city, reflecting a very simple architecture.\nIt was a low, grey stone building with a low, red tile roof that blended with the distant mountains. The entrance was in the northeast wall. Within, 16 columns held up an open, sloping roof. The interior of the building was lined with white marble. It had four pools, one in each corner but the northwest, and one in the center.\nFour golden links were hidden there, doubling as the drain grates of the bath."
