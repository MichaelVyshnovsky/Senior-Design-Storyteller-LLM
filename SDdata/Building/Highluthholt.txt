'''Highluthholt''' was a temple to [[Mielikki]] in the [[High Forest]] destroyed in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It lay amidst the forest some day's journey east of [[Secomber]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1214}}, Highluthholt was attacked and torn apart by a flight of seven [[wyvern]]s that carried off a number of treasures, including the holy [[spellbook]] ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''. The culprit was suspected to be a villainous wizard who used magically controlled wyverns in a number of robberies and raids around the time. The name and fate of this wizard were unknown, and the ''Companion'' remained lost for years.
