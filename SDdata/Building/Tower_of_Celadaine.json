        "mainbody": "Celadaines tower was a solitary watchtower used by the Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar and home to their fallen champion Celadaine.\nIt was located on the edge New Sharandars territory in the Feywild, in a region of the plane that came to be part of the Realm of Malabog.\nThe tower was a circular stone structure, nearly as wide as its four stories were tall. The ground level was constructed with the widest, topped with a stone-tile overhang that led to floor above it. Buttresses extended out from the sides of the tower to the stone-tiled roof of the second floor, which stood more narrow than the first. The third floor of the tower was narrower still, which led to the open-air arcade at the towers peak.\nthumb|right|300px|The ground floor of Celadaines tower\nThe bottom floor of Celadaines tower comprised a vast circular central chamber lined with massive stone statues of armored soldiers, encircled by outer curving hallways. In the years after Celadaines fall, the chamber was filled with scores of massive stones that hovered in place above the ground floors portal, that filled the room with eerie green light. This magical pathway was the only way to ascend the tower, as there were There were no stairs or passageways leading up.\nThe library level of the tower encompassed the second floor, laid out in a similar manner as the first. The outer hallways were decorated with grand statues and tall bookcases that lined long stretches of the outer walls. The ceilings of the halls were enchanted in such a way that they shimmered with motes of lights that resembled the stars of the nights sky. The floor of the central chamber featured a filigreed glass platform that sparkled with motes of light and a column of radiance that allowed for ascension upward to the top floor.\nThe garden level was received an abundance of sunlight from outside, allowing for the growth of the many ferns and trees set in vases and planters within. Laid out in the same floor plan as the lower levels, the center of the room held a means of magical conveyance that granted access to towers roof.\nThe roof of the tower was an expansive circular arcade that featured engraved walls and massive stone tiles that surrounded a glass platform like the one found on the second floor. A portal could be conjured on the roof to allow access out of the tower.\nWhile the tower itself was a sentinel that helped ensure the safety of New Sharandar, it featured little defenses beyond the defenders that lived within its walls.\nthumb|right|150px|The spirit of a Gatekeeper, left to languish in the tower\nThe tower of Celadaine was built specifically for his master, to aid his efforts defending Iliyanbruen from the dark fey agents of the Gloaming Court. While the elf and his retainers stood strong against their assaults for many years, they wavered when the dark fey switched their tactics and began assailing Celadaines psyche. Eventually the great elven warrior went mad and slew every one of the elves that served him. The Gloaming Court supplanted the residents of the tower with their own dark fey minions, whom Celadaine came to view as his friends and companions.\nIn the late 15 century DR Celadaine swore himself to serve the fomorian king Malabog, offering himself to the giant as a black knight servitor. Feeling betrayed by their former friend Celadaine, the elves of New Sharandar enlisted the aid of the Heroes of Neverwinter to raid the tower, in order to remove Celadaine from power and free the spirits of the elves he butchered so many years before.\nDuring the height of New Sharandars glory days, the towers only residents were Celadaine and the Gatekeepers, elves that were entrusted by their master to protect the portals that connected its numerous floors.\nFollowing Celadaines fall from grace, the tower became overrun by dark fey creatures such as redcaps, quicklings, and their fey hound beasts, along with a number of cyclopses."
