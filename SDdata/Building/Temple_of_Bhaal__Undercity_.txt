The Temple of Bhaal in the Undercity was an abandoned house of worship dedicated to the Lord of Murder beneath the city of Baldurs Gate.
The temple was the lone standing structure in that part of the Undercity. It was surrounded by a great many ruins.
The exterior of the temple was built in such a way that its walls appeared to be made from (or actually were made from) hundreds of bones formed together into massive blocks. It was decorated with armored figures and several large, humanoid skulls.

The interior of the building was just as imposing. Six statues robed figures wielding scythes lined the sides of the main chamber. Two fiendish statues were set along the rear wall.
In the center of the temple was a massive carving of Bhaals holy symbol.
Beyond that was the actual altar that was presumably used by Bhaalist priests. It was decorated with an exquisite tapestry and basins of shimmering purple liquid.
By the mid–14 century DR, the temple was riddled with deadly traps. For instance, each of the twelve tears of Bhaal on the floors holy symbol were trapped in a manner that they could not be disarmed by normal means.
In the , the Bhaalspawn Sarevok designated this temple as the location within which he would perform the dark ritual that would elevate him as the new Lord of Murder.
Some time before Uktar of that year, Sarevok and his last remaining allies made a final stand against Abdel Adrian and his allies. Among the combatants were the bandit leader Tazok, the conjurer Semaj, and the disgraced Flaming Fist officer, Angelo Dosan. The battle ended with the death of Sarevok and the end of his attempted coup of Baldurs Gate.
Though the temple had been destroyed by the heroic group, it was rebuilt sometime in the 15th century, with Sarevok as custodian of the Murder Tribunal and Dark Urge, a pure blood Bhaalspawn leading the Bhaalist cult. Later Sarevoks granddaughter Orin usurpered Dark Urged and ruled over the temple instead 
One side of the temple featured a half dozen sarcophagi, several of which housed undead battle horrors.
