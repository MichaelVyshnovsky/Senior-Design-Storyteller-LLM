The '''Goldhall of the Sacraments''' was a temple dedicated to [[Waukeen]] located in the city of [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
The temple was run by High Priest [[Muntiver Salesh]]. Muntiver was assisted by five other priests. Waukeen's silence during the [[Time of Troubles]] prompted many priests and followers within the Goldhall to abandon their faith. High Priest Salesh even considered joining the worship of [[Cyric]] as he believed the new [[deity]] stole some of Waukeen's power.
