        "mainbody": "The Tower of Pizentios was a singular large spire found on the northeast region of the island of Sahu in the Ruined Kingdoms of east Zakhara in the early 1400s DR.\nThe Tower was roughly mushroom-shaped, similar to the towers found in the ruins of Ereshkigal on the opposite side of the island. The Tower was situated near a small lagoon where several storage sheds could be found.\nA door in the basement of the Tower led into the Underdark and the Garden of Eternity.\nAs its name implied, the Tower was the home of the necromancer Pizentios in 1367 DR."
