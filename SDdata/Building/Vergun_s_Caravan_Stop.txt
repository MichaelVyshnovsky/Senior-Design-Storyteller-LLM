Verguns Caravan Stop was a shoddy shop found in Teshwave around 1367 DR that charged outrageous prices for common goods.
The caravan stop was owned by Vergun, an unscrupulous merchant who had to bribe the local powers in order to setup shop. Perhaps the bribes were higher than expected, forcing him to charge ridiculous prices for common goods of low quality.
