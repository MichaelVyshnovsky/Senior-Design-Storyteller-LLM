The facet sphere was a small chamber located in the Underdark. Its facets could be manipulated in order to release trapped souls.
The sphere was found in the Underdark, south-west of Ust Natha.
Many crystal sub-chambers were part of the greater sphere, each of which could hold a soul. The sphere was of a strange design, and large weeping faces were seen around the sides.
In 1369 DR, the svirfneblin boy, Bedlen Daglefodd, accidentally got himself imprisoned in the sphere and got separated from his father, Therndle Daglefodd. Therndle may have asked Gorions Ward to seek out and rescue his son. Released beings were usually crazed and violent from the illusions that had witnessed in the strange device.
The sphere trapped many beings of different races and status, from young children to powerful liches. The following inhabitants were trapped in the device around 1369 DR
* Aganalo
* Raevilin Strathi
* Riti
* Alchra Diagott
* Bedlen Daglefodd
* Gont of Riatavin
