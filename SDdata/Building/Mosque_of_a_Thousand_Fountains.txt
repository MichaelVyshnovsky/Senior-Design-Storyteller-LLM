The Mosque of a Thousand Fountains was a temple dedicated to Zann found in Muluk, the City of Kings, in 1367 DR.
The mosque actually straddled a large section of the city walls.
This mosque was not only a house of worship for Zann, but also served as a small university for the wealthy elite of Muluk. A well-documented library was accessible by the public six days per week. Much of its contents dealt with Muluks rich history.
