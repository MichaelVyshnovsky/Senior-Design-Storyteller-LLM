It was said to contain over a thousand score books, scrolls, and other individual documents.\nIt was located on the north side of the towns Money Quarter.\nThe three-story building was protected by a magical ward that shielded the structure, and everything within, from any manner of fire and lightning.\nThe library catered to the scribes and scholars that were sanctioned by the Scribes Friendship guild. They spent much of their time copying, chronicling, and categorizing all of the works contained within its shelves.\nWhile anyone could spend time within the librarys entrance hall, only guild scribes were allowed to access its archives. Members of the Thinkers Fraternity were allowed to access its books free of charge."
