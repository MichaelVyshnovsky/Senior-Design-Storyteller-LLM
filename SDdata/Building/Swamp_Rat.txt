The '''Swamp Rat''' was a tavern outside the town of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by [[Hesketh Pratt]].

==Location==
It stood south of town, near the [[Vast Swamp]], and around {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} from [[Benelaius]]'s cottage.

==Structure==
It had two stories. On the ground, facing the town, the front entrance led to the common room and the rear entrance to the kitchen, facing the swamp. Upstairs were six rooms for guests in front and a hall in the rear. The building had few windows, only one per room.

==Description==
True to its name, the Swamp Rat was rough-looking place, with a floor covered in sawdust and crushed [[oyster]] shells to soak up spills and worse. A smoky mirror hung on the wall behind the bar.

==Atmosphere==
The Swamp Rat catered to the local farmers, saving them the need to travel into town for a drink and a chat, but merchants of the town sometimes also went to visit. Their conversation was about as dry and work-related as one could expect. It was typically empty during the day.

==Services==
With a limited selection, it offered [[ale]], [[beer]], [[cider]], and a certain table [[wine]]. However, Shortshanks said the ale was flat, the beer worse than what [[horse]]s make, the cider sour, and the wine watered, though he was obviously biased, while Jasper believed the wine better suited to cleaning paint brushes. But it was cheap, which was the other main point in the Swamp Rat's favor, and it was watered down. The most costly drink was [[Shadowdark ale]].

It also had jars of pickled [[egg]]s on the bar, turned an unappetizing shade of green.

The upstairs rooms could be rented by those who wished to stay the night.

==History==
The Swamp Rat opened in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.<ref> group="note">The tavern is said to be "recently opened" in ''Murder in Cormyr'', and was invented for the novel. Hence, no tavern of that name is mentioned in the description of Ghars in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'', published prior. While the novel is officially set in 1367 DR, the sourcebook is undated. For convenience, this article assumes the Swamp Rat was open in the same year. It immediately stole customers and business from the [[Bold Bard]], previously the only tavern in town, which angered its owner [[Shortshanks]].

However, sightings of the ghost of the bandit chieftain [[Fastred]], some by patrons leaving late at night, caused the Swamp Rat's business to drop off sharply as customers went back to the Bold Bard.

Shortshanks thought this was all great for the Bold Bard. When Dovo turned up dead and exposed as the ghost on the morning of [[Eleint 17]], Shortshanks feared people would go back to the Swamp Rat, but was optimistic that they'd fear the murderer more. Either way, Hesketh was pleased to get any paying customers.

[[Grodoveth]], the envoy of King [[Azoun IV]], stayed at the Swamp Rat on the night of Eleint 17. However, he was found slain in the Vast Swamp the [[Eleint 18|next day]]. In addition, rather than a ghost, a rogue [[hydra]] prowled the land around the Swamp Rat on those nights and chased people leaving the Swamp Rat like [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]], until it was slain by [[Kendra]].
