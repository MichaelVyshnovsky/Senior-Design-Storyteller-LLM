Fine Rugs was a collection of three tents in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz. It was operated by the shrewd merchant Alik Aksama.
Fine Rugs was not so much a permanent store as it was three large tents placed together. The first tent was filled with rugs fit for the common shopper. The second brimmed with tapestries of all qualities. The third tent only catered to clients with the heaviest purses. Fine Rugs was always busy, and few left one of the tents without purchasing anything.
