Reaching the rooms via the portal was easy. One just needed to think of the destination.

The throne stood in the center of the triangular chamber.\n\nThe only room within the Temple of Ubtao was the barado.

The barado was the dark audience hall for communing with Ubtao directly and was never used unless a new bara was to take the god's test.",
        "Location": "The center of Mezro was a round cobblestone plaza with the magnificent Temple of Ubtao standing in the very middle with four avenues stretching from the center to the city's rim, separating it into quarters: Agricultural, Residential, Market, and Scholars' Quarters.",
        "Structure": "The temple was an intricately constructed building of nine stories rising above the ground. Many flying buttresses accentuated the temple's architecture. The temple had rows of large windows of stained glass and a glistening [[gold]]en dome crowing the structure.\n\nThe magical walls of the temple had a disorienting effect on outsiders. Whatever part of the city they were looking at the temple, it always appeared to have only one wall and looked exactly the same from any angle. These magical walls were constructed using triangular crystal bricks dovetailing together into one smooth surface with one lonely door leading inside. Upon closer examination, the crystals of the wall appeared fragile and delicate as the finest [[Sembia]]n lace.\n\nThe enchantments of the temple's wall could enthrall onlookers. If affected by the images in the crystals, the viewed could stand entranced staring at the walls until forced to look away. The images that were created on the wall reflected the onlooker's deepest desires.\n\nDue to the divine origin of the temple, any person or thing within its walls was shielded from ''[[scrying]]''.",

        "Services": "The temple offered many services to citizens and travelers and was open to them all day and night. The [[cleric]]s provided guests with ''[[heal|healing]]'' in exchange for a donation to the temple. Servants and bara of Ubtao were healed for free. Travelers were never allowed to sleep in the temple, especially without the King's permission, and were always removed from its grounds.\n\nMembers of [[Sseth]], [[Thard Harr]], and [[Ubtao]] clergy were allowed to worship in the Temple of Ubtao. The temple held no organized services or ceremonies, apart from selecting the next bara.\n\nAll dead of Mezro were interred in the Temple of Ubtao.",
        "History": "The Temple of Ubtao, along with the city of Mezro, was created in [[-2637 DR]] by the deity himself. Over the centuries, the temple survived wars, [[goblin]] attacks, [[dinosaur]]s, and many other threats.\n\nIn 1362 DR{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}, the temple's barado became a secure hiding spot for the evil and deadly artifact known as the ''[[Ring of Winter]]''. The ring was briefly used by [[Ras T'fima]] in an attempt to rescue [[Negus Kwalu]] and [[Theron Silvermace]] from a tribe of ravenous [[Batiri]] goblins. Attempting to summon a centralized blizzard, T'fima froze the jungles for miles around and made it pelt the area with snow for three days. Scared of the ring's power, he deposited it in the only place that was inaccessible to almost everyone - the barado.\n\nThe same year, rumors of the bizarre jungle blizzard brought two parties to Chult in search of the ''ring''. [[Artus Cimber]], an adventurer and a [[Harper]], and his nemesis, [[Kaverin Ebonhand]], the Butcher of [[Tantras]]. In his quest, Kaverin allied with the Batiri queen [[M'bobo]] and with her allied clans of Chultan goblins, aided by [[pterafolk]], they laid siege to Mezro. During the open deadly conflict, the Temple of Ubtao served as shelter and hospital for hurt defenders and civilians of the hidden city. Artus found out of the ''ring'' being hidden in the barado and was adamant about risking his life trying to wrestle the artifact from the god himself. Artus avoided being taken to the afterlife for violating the temple. He directly interacted with many avatars of Ubtao and passed the bara test. Artus was to draw the maze of his life. He drew his past and came to the epiphany that he can't make an error drawing the future; anything he were to draw would be correct. Artus received the ability to control the ''Ring of Winter's'' evil powers, becoming the guardian of the city.\n\nWith the artifact's power, the tide of battle was turned in favor of Mezro, and the city survived another strife. Weeks later, when the city was rebuilt, Mezro held the first official barae ceremony in a very long time. A young girl named [[Fipya]] was granted the power to control plants and set to restore the city's waning food storages.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, Temple of Ubtao, along with the rest of Mezro, was thought to have been destroyed in the ''[[Spellplague]]'' of [[1385 DR]]â€“[[1395 DR]]. In truth, the city avoided the hellish cataclysm with the powers of the city's barae. They were guided by Ubtao and moved the entire city to a paradise demiplane. The only person to know of that was Artus Cimber, who was left behind after the city's \"destruction.\""
