        "mainbody": "The '''Sleeping Cat''' was a [[tavern]] and restaurant located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]]. Its proprietor was [[Whelgar Taerncole]].",
        "History": "The Sleeping Cat was originally just a tavern, and a rowdy place that enjoyed nightly brawls, until it was bought by Whelgar Taerncole. Sick of the brawling, Whelgar got rid of both taproom and [[wine]] cellar, and developed the place as a restaurant instead. In [[1358 DR]], the Sleeping Cat operated as both tavern and restaurant.\n\nBy around [[1369 DR]], the Sleeping Cat had steadily become a proper, quality restaurant, with an improving menu. It was a favorite of [[Volothamp Geddarm]].",
        "Services": "The Sleeping Cat had only a small menu, but the cooks dedicated themselves to mastering the recipes and slowly improving it. The [[Volo's Guide to Cormyr|''Volo's Guide'']] would give the restaurant a top rating but for the limited menu.\n\nAmong its offerings were roast [[venison]], [[fried eel soup]], [[pork]] pastries, [[chicken]] and [[pheasant]] pies, stewed [[hare]], wine-simmered [[goose]], and aged [[brandycake]]. The only alcoholic beverages were a small quantities of [[brandy]], [[clarry]], and [[mead]].\n\nThe cooks could remember a regular patron's preferences, such as whether they wanted their meat rare or well done, or if they liked [[horseradish]] or [[gravy]]."
