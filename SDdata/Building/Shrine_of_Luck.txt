The '''Shrine of Luck''' was a shrine in [[Phandalin]] dedicated to the worship of [[Tymora]].

==Location==
The small shrine was located in the center of Phandalin, specifically to the north of the central hub. It was made of a set of stones from the neighboring ruins.

==History==
The place of worship was under the care of Sister [[Garaele]] in [[1491 DR]]. and in her absence it was ransacked by [[Velleen Firecrow]], a member of the [[Cult of Talos]].

While the town of [[Leilon]] to the south was being rebuilt, it relied on the Shrine of Luck for certain supplies, such as [[holy water]].

The Shrine remained the only temple in Phandalin until the [[Temple of the Coinmaiden]], a place of worship dedicated to [[Waukeen]], opened in [[1496 DR]].{{AI-time}}
