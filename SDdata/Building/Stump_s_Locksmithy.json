        "Structure": "Stump's Locksmithy was a one-story building in poor condition.",
        "Services": "Stump's Locksmithy's locks and mechanisms were characterized by their exceptional complexity and quality, making them notoriously difficult for [[thieves]] and burglars to pick or disarm. Prices reflected the quality of the work, starting at 150 [[gold pieces]] for a standard lock and increasing significantly for added features, such as [[trap]]s or heightened complexity. Additionally, Stump was an avid [[chess]] player, and he offered a unique discount: anyone who defeated him in a game received a one-time 20% reduction on their purchase.",
        "Inhabitants": "The owner was [[Stump]], a [[human]] [[rogue]] renowned for his skill in crafting highly sophisticated locks and traps."
