Delfens Tower was the home of the skilled wizard Delfen Ondabarl who inhabited the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Delfens Tower was actually incorporated into the surrounding wall that encapsulated Daggerford. The tower stood along the midway point of Daggerfords northern wall near the Farmers Gate. The tower was located along Wall Street.
The outward facing arrow slits on the towers walls were smaller that usual given that Delfen only needed to see a target to cast a spell at them. The inward facing walls of the tower had larger windows so that he could enjoy a view of the city.
Delfens Tower was three stories tall. He used the top level as his personal quarters. The second level served as a classroom and dormitory for his students. The ground level was used to stable his mule and general supplies.
Delfen moved to Daggerford when the north wall was under construction. In exchange for a generous donation, Delfen was able to acquire one of the defensive towers to use as his personal home.
