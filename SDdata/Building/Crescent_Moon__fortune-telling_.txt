The '''Crescent Moon''' was a fortune teller shop and residence of the [[gypsy]] [[Kisandra]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].It is not specified where exactly in Ravens Bluff this store is located.

==Structure==
The Crescent Moon was a rather old, one-story building divided into eighteen rooms. It was made of [[stucco]], had a flat stone roof, and lacked any windows in the rooms where business was conducted.

==Interior==
The parlor where business was primarily conducted was covered in a thick carpet and sparsely furnished, having only a few chairs and a table where [[candle]]s and cards would be placed. In the adjoining rooms where other services were offered, the carpets were of a finer quality, the chairs were more comfortable, and the tables were larger. The one for fortune-telling had a [[crystal ball]], whilst the one used for seances was engraved with a silver pentacle. The rest of the building was taken up by a kitchen, sleeping quarters, and storage rooms.

==Services==
Kisandra primarily offered non-[[magical]] fortune-telling through the reading of cards or palms for the price of a few [[copper piece]]s. These fortunes were neither quite precise nor wildly inaccurate. She also offered to contact the [[spirit]]s of the deceased and perform "genuine [[divination]]" for more wealthy clientele, though in actuality for both services Kisandra merely used a ''[[medallion of ESP]]'' and [[spell]]s from the [[illusion]] [[school of magic]] to trick her clients. Though her methods were chicanery, genuine knowledge of folklore, legends, and the [[undead]]{{Cite polyhedron/42/The Living City: The Crescent Moon|29}}

Besides fortune-telling, the Crescent Moon provided temporary housing for wandering gypsies, though it did not openly advertise this service.

==Inhabitants==
Besides Kisandra herself, the Crescent Moon was home to her grandchildren [[Jacko]] and [[Lucinda]]. The latter would read fortunes for clients whenever Kisandra was taking a break and otherwise would use her attractive looks to distract Kisandra's more cynical clients.
