        "mainbody": "he Fouled Line, often referred to by locals as The Line, was a tavern in Harrowdale.\nThe Line sat at the southeastern end of Dendever Street on the Heart of the Harbor pier separate from the rest of the town.\nThis rough tavern stank of ale, fish, and worse. The mood of the tavern was enhanced by old rotten nets adorning the walls and a plethora of marine refuse decorating the ceiling including dried giant squids and shark jaws.\nSailors enjoyed the strong ale, garlic buttered biscuits, and butter tarts, all of which could be had for a mere 2 sp per plate. The sailors also enjoyed keeping the Line to themselves and disliked landlubbers. Sailors would dunk rude or arrogant folk into the bay by tricking them to stand over strategic trap doors in the floor that were activated by a nearby lever. Sailors gladly paid a 4 sp fee to the tavernmaster in order to pull the lever themselves. These trap doors were close to where the privy also emptied into the bay."
