'''Jessyleia's Drinking Jack''', or the '''Jessajack''' as it was referred to by [[Mosstonian]]s, was a sparkling and loud new drinking establishment in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Interior==
Unlike some other taverns in Tethyr and in the north, this establishment was brightly lit. Its interior was colorfully decorated with lush pinks and purples, exotic bright Calishite curtains, and see-through screens covering the sources of light that made everyone and everything in the Jessajack appear odd and extraplanar.

The bar stand, which sometimes served as a stage, was made out of painted swirlglass with shells, bones, [[dagger]]s, and a single eyeball, impeded in it.

Jessyleia's Drinking Jack was probably one of the cleanest establishments in [[Faer√ªn]]. Its floor tiles were spotless and clean enough to eat off of.

===Atmosphere===
The Jessajack's halls were often flooded with loud bellow [[drum]]s and blast-[[horn]]s music. The clientele was just as loud. This tavern was the spot to be seen at, popular among social butterflies and self-important residents of Mosstone. A guest could always see locals loudly discussing their exclusive business deals, posh lives, and alleged interactions with important [[archwizard]]s and kings.

==Services==
The loud tavern offered a passable [[beer]] selection and scant range of [[wine]]s for purchase, and all were overpriced for the quality offered. The only type of food that was served at the Jessajack were little finger-pastries and tiny decorated cakes.

The store's proprietor, [[Jessyleia]], was a successful [[silk]]s-dancer from [[Calimshan]] who put her money into her tavern. She was known to occasionally appear on the Jessajack's bar for an impromptu performance.

Jessyleia employed a group of female dances that were quite breathtaking in their skill.
