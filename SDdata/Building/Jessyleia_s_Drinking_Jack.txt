Jessyleias Drinking Jack, or the Jessajack as it was referred to by Mosstonians, was a sparkling and loud new drinking establishment in the late 14 century DR.
Unlike some other taverns in Tethyr and in the north, this establishment was brightly lit. Its interior was colorfully decorated with lush pinks and purples, exotic bright Calishite curtains, and see-through screens covering the sources of light that made everyone and everything in the Jessajack appear odd and extraplanar.
The bar stand, which sometimes served as a stage, was made out of painted swirlglass with shells, bones, daggers, and a single eyeball, impeded in it.
Jessyleias Drinking Jack was probably one of the cleanest establishments in Faer√ªn. Its floor tiles were spotless and clean enough to eat off of.
The Jessajacks halls were often flooded with loud bellow drums and blast-horns music. The clientele was just as loud. This tavern was the spot to be seen at, popular among social butterflies and self-important residents of Mosstone. A guest could always see locals loudly discussing their exclusive business deals, posh lives, and alleged interactions with important archwizards and kings.
The loud tavern offered a passable beer selection and scant range of wines for purchase, and all were overpriced for the quality offered. The only type of food that was served at the Jessajack were little finger-pastries and tiny decorated cakes.
The stores proprietor, Jessyleia, was a successful silks-dancer from Calimshan who put her money into her tavern. She was known to occasionally appear on the Jessajacks bar for an impromptu performance.
Jessyleia employed a group of female dances that were quite breathtaking in their skill.
