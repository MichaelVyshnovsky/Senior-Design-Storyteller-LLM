        "mainbody": "'''The Stronghold''' was [[Perendra Raslemtar]]'s name for her house in [[Voonlar]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|39}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 33: A Farewell to Voonlar}} which she occupied from the early 1350s DR until the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], when she was recruited by then prince-in-exile [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] to join his quest to reclaim the throne of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Location": "The Stronghold was located on the western edge of Voonlar, surrounded by the forest.",
        "Structure": "It was built in the style of a manor house, but with added fortifications to protect against raids by brigands or [[Zhentarim]] agents.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|38}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 32: Perendra's Little Secret}}",
        "Interior": "Details of the interior of her Voonlarran home were known only to friends and allies of the [[Harpers]]. There were a number of underground cellars with connecting passages.",
        "Exterior": "Leading off to the southwest was a footpath that led, in order, to an externally accessible root cellar, an abandoned privy, an oven for burning combustible waste (bones and all), and finally a small clearing containing a chopping block and a woodpile. There were three deer paths that radiated from this clearing and melded into the woods. The middle of the three led past a boulder with a top almost flat enough to be a table, and then passed between two very large, rotting tree stumps. In the span of two or three paces along this path between the stumps was a ''[[portal]]'' that could be activated by speaking one or more command words.",
        "The ''Portal''": {
            "Controlling the ''Portal''": "To reach a destination required uttering a command word unique to that destination. To travel to Delzimmer, the word was \"Alnegust\". To travel to the safe room, the word was \"Orntharm\". To travel to Voonlar, the word was \"Felderenslor\". If the word \"Haloom\" was added either before or after \"Alnegust\" or \"Felderenslor\", then the destination was immediately wreathed in a ''[[fog cloud]]'' that lasted thirty minutes if not dissipated by wind. If the command word for the current location was spoken, nothing happened. If \"Haloom\" and the command word for the current location was uttered, then no travel took place but the ''fog cloud'' appeared.The instructions for using the ''portal'' are inconsistent and confusing in the source. I have simplified them to what I believe the author intended. Please check for yourself."

        "Activities": "Perendra was a member of the Harpers and she gave shelter to them when needed. When not acting as a Harper agent, she studied the [[arcane]] arts."
