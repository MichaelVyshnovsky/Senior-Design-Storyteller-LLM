The Zhentish Merchant Quarters was the unnamed home and base of operations in Thentia for the Zhentish merchants and spies Abrix Myll and Oryk Kalain.
The merchants quarters was in the north-west of Thentia, located at a major intersection of roads a short distance from the main gates of the city.
The house was a large, elaborate building, with a tall, ornate spire at each corner of the building.
The north-east and south-west spires of the house were hollowed out and turned into secure storage for the Zhentarims stolen gold, each tower containing approximately a stash of treasure worth about 8,000 gp.
Abrix and Oryk were responsible for the safekeeping and sensible spending of the hoard of treasure valued 16,000 gp that had been stolen from the temple of Waukeen in 1345 DR. They used the money to fund operations in the city without outside aid.
In addition to the two experienced resident agents, the house was guarded by ten veteran Zhentarim mercenaries who acted as house guards. The treasure hoards themselves were protected by carefully-kept giant spiders, as well as mechanical trip-alarm bell traps hidden on the roofs of the towers.
