The '''Zhentish Merchant Quarters''' was the unnamed home and base of operations in [[Thentia]] for the [[Zhentarim|Zhentish]] merchants and spies [[Abrix Myll]] and [[Oryk Kalain]].

==Location==
The merchant's quarters was in the north-west of Thentia, located at a major intersection of roads a short distance from the main gates of the city.

==Structure==
The house was a large, elaborate building, with a tall, ornate spire at each corner of the building.

The north-east and south-west spires of the house were hollowed out and turned into secure storage for the Zhentarim's stolen gold, each tower containing approximately a stash of treasure worth about 8,000 [[gp]].

==Activities==
Abrix and Oryk were responsible for the safekeeping and sensible spending of the hoard of treasure valued 16,000 gp that had been stolen from the temple of [[Waukeen]] in [[1345 DR]]. They used the money to fund operations in the city without outside aid.

==Defenses==
In addition to the two experienced resident agents, the house was guarded by ten veteran Zhentarim mercenaries who acted as house guards. The treasure hoards themselves were protected by carefully-kept [[giant spider]]s, as well as mechanical trip-alarm bell traps hidden on the roofs of the towers.
