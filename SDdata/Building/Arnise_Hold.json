        "mainbody": "The Arnise Hold,In Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn, the keep was referred to as \"DeArnise Hold\". or Arnise Hall, was the familial keep and homestead of the noble Arnise family of Amn. It was a well-kept, if rather plain, stronghold that offered a few amenities to visitors and farmers in the region. The Arnise family possessed a great deal of hospitality, a trait well-appreciated by their vassals.\nthumb|The locations of DeArnise Hold in Zehoarastria.\nThe Arnise keep was a small, two-story stronghold with a small courtyard and spacious cellar.\nCellar\nBeneath the keep were a number of long hallways, which connected to a small, subterranean cavern down one path and the Arnise family tomb in the opposite direction.\nCourtyard\nOutside the main keep, but within the outer walls, was the holds courtyard where Lord Arnise kept his dogs.\nGround floor\nThe grand hall was the central feature of the ground floor of the keep. Surrounding the hall were storage rooms, servants quarters, the keeps kitchens, and a forge.\nSecond floor\nThe top floor of the keep contained the keeps library and a columned chamber where a portion of the Arnise family treasure was held. The chests in this hall were protected by a cadre of golems.\nOutside the keep were spacious stables, with room and feed for plenty of mounts and pack animals (though livestock were forbidden). Use of the stables cost 4 sp per animal.\nThere was an adjoining guest house that was available for rent for a mere 2 sp a head per night. Patrons staying in there were given comfy fur blankets to keep the cold away. Meals provided by the skilled cooks of the Arnise kitchen were exceptionally delicious and well-prepared. They included delights such as boar dumplings and fried hack, a plate of smoked fish and bacon both of which were served with a dish made of barley and mushrooms.\nDrunks were not allowed to stay at the guest house and were relocated to the horse stables.\nArnise family\n*Lord Arnise Ruler of the hold and patriarch of the Arnise family \n*Delcia Arnise\n*Nalia deArnise\nStaff and servants\n*Captain Arat\n*Daleson\n*Glacias\nSometime around 1368 DR, the Arnise keep was invaded by a band of yuan-ti and trolls, led by Torgal."
