        "mainbody": "The '''Arnise Hold''',<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'', the keep was referred to as \"De'Arnise Hold\". or '''Arnise Hall''', was the familial keep and homestead of the noble [[Arnise]] family of [[Amn]]. It was a well-kept, if rather plain, stronghold that offered a few amenities to visitors and farmers in the region. The Arnise family possessed a great deal of hospitality, a trait well-appreciated by their vassals.",
        "Description": {
            "Services": "Outside the keep were spacious stables, with room and feed for plenty of mounts and pack animals (though livestock were forbidden). Use of the stables cost 4 [[sp]] per animal.\n\nThere was an adjoining guest house that was available for rent for a mere 2 sp a head per night. Patrons staying in there were given comfy fur blankets to keep the cold away. Meals provided by the skilled cooks of the Arnise kitchen were exceptionally delicious and well-prepared. They included delights such as boar dumplings and [[fried hack]], a plate of smoked fish and bacon; both of which were served with a dish made of [[barley]] and mushrooms.\n\nDrunks were not allowed to stay at the guest house and were relocated to the horse stables."
