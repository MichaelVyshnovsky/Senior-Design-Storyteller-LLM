The market in Blackfeather Bridge in Featherdale was a covered pavilion where local farmers traded and sold wares and livestock.
Given the name of their village, locals referred to this farm market as the "Black Market," much to the dismay of Sembians who made the trip to Blackfeather Bridge with the hopes of purchasing something illicit.
In addition to selling produce and livestock, some local farmers also rented out their grown children as guards for caravans passing through. Some of the delicious jams, jellies, and sauces acquired here were often resold at ridiculous prices in places as far away as Hillsfar. A merchant from Ordulin made a good amount of coin selling wax-sealed glass jars to the makers of such precious jams. To thwart would-be stone-throwers from destroying his wares he threatened to release a bottle spirit.
