The '''market''' in [[Blackfeather Bridge (village)|Blackfeather Bridge]] in [[Featherdale]] was a covered pavilion where local farmers traded and sold wares and livestock.

Given the name of their village, locals referred to this farm market as the "Black Market," much to the dismay of [[Sembian]]s who made the trip to Blackfeather Bridge with the hopes of purchasing something illicit.

==Activities==
In addition to selling produce and livestock, some local farmers also rented out their grown children as guards for caravans passing through. Some of the delicious jams, jellies, and sauces acquired here were often resold at ridiculous prices in places as far away as [[Hillsfar]]. A merchant from [[Ordulin]] made a good amount of coin selling [[sealing wax|wax-sealed]] [[glass]] [[jar]]s to the makers of such precious jams. To thwart would-be stone-throwers from destroying his wares he threatened to release a bottle [[spirit]].
