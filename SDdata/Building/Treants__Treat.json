        "mainbody": "The '''Treants' Treat''' was a famous tavern found in the city of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Location": "It was located on the corner of [[Phelindra Stree]] and [[Suldar's Walk]], in the inclusive district of [[Dlabraddath]].",
        "Structure": "The Treants' Treat comprised a ground-level building and the three underground levels that descended beneath, which included the tavern's taproom. The subterranean walls of the establishment were entwined with the roots of Myth Drannor's great many trees.",
        "Services": "The tavern was well known for being the first establishment in Myth Drannor that did not discriminate its patronage in any manner.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that the subterranean root system that made its way into the tavern's basement was once inhabited by two different deities, [[Arvoreen]] and [[Mystra]]. In truth they were just animated by an elven tree [[spirit]] that simply wished to enjoy a discussion with their former kin."
