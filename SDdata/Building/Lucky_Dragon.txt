'''The Lucky Dragon''' was a dimly-lit gambling house in [[Jester's Green]] that catered to the local [[Purple Dragons]].

==Services==
Seats could be rented at the gaming tables for 1 [[gp]] per hour, regulated by an intricate [[water clock]] that chimed at the top of the hour, though Purple Dragons paid half as much. Poor [[ale]] and worse [[wine]] was served in large [[clay]] cups for 4 [[cp]] per serving, and local girls could be hired as company for gamblers who needed some comfort.

A variety of games were played there, mainly ones that were popular with Purple Dragons wherever they were stationed. They included [[Toss the Dagger]], [[Traitor's Heads]], and [[Swords and Shields]].
