        "mainbody": "The '''Old Anvil Smithy''' was the noisy, [[soot]]-covered workshop of the master blacksmith of [[Sundabar]], [[Alabuth Helfyn]]. Though it was little more than a barn of a building, Alabuth called the ''Old Anvil'' his home, and from there he crafted arms and armor for the people of Sundabar. It was located just around the corner from ''Turnstone gate'' in the eastern section of the city. \n\nThough they had been independently invented in other regions of [[Toril]], Sundabar was known as the birthplace for the invention of ''[[caltrop]]s'' in [[the North]]. These small, metal spiked objects, that could halt the charge of mounted [[barbarian]]s, were a renowned export of the ''Old Anvil Smithy''."
