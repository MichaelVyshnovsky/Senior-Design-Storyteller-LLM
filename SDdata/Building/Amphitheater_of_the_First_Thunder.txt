The '''Amphitheater of the First Thunder''' was a temple and combat arena dedicated to [[Hoar]], the Doombringer.

==Location==
The temple was located in the capital city of [[Mourktar]] in [[Threskel]].

==Description==
The Amphitheater was a large open arena. The section of the compound that served as the temple was located underground.

==Activities==
Gladitorial matches occurred within the Amphitheater between the accused and accusers. These contests were used instead of a traditional court system as a form of justice. Hoar was believed to intervene in each match to ensure fitting justice was always served.

The power and influence of the Amphitheater of the First Thunder diminished with the death of King [[Theris]], who was a devout follower of Hoar, during the [[Time of Troubles]].
