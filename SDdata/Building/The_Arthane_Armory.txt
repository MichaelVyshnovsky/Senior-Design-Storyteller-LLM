'''The Arthane Armory''' was a weapons shop in [[Waterdeep]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Armory lay in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]], between [[Crossbow Lane]] and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]].

==Services==
The Armory sold a variety of basic, dependable weapons that were exported across [[the North]] and [[Western Heartlands]]. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Arthane Furnace]], where the blades were forged, and [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in [[Secomber]], who finished the blades before sending them on to the Armory. The final finish on the weapons used [[whetstone]]s from [[House of Yarthin]] and "fire oil" from [[Famryn's Fine Oils]] before they were sold.

The Armory also repaired and resharpened blades of all types for a fee, and performed alterations such as replacing the hilt or changing the appearance of weapons.

==History==
The Armory and the greater business was founded by [[Eldegul Arthane]], who sought to fill the gap left by declining [[dwarf|dwarven]] industry in [[the North]].
