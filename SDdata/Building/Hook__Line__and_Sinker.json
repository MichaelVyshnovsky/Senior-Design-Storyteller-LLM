        "mainbody": "'''Hook, Line, and Sinker''' was a tavern located in the settlement of [[Caer-Konig]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was readily identifiable as the most popular locale in the entire town.",
        "Location": "The tavern was located in the town's market square.",
        "Services": "The tavern's owner [[Eglendar Korr|Eglendar \"Glen\" Korr]] had a unique marketing scheme that tied into his business' name. The \"hook\" was the free half-pint of [[ale]] personally given to every patron, whereas the \"line\" referred to the subsequent drinks they invariably ordered afterwards, and the \"sinker\" was the tavern's last call, which culminated in drinking contests held between town locals and visitors.\n\nThe ale the tavern served came from the [[dwarves]] of the [[Dwarven Valley]], the settlement at the base of [[Kelvin's Cairn]]."
