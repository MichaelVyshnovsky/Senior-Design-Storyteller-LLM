        "mainbody": "he Temple of Waukeen was the only temple dedicated to the Merchants Friend, Waukeen in Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Temple of Waukeen was a large domed structure decorated with golden statues of the goddess. It was erected in Tyrs Eye – the elevated district by the Castle Never, across the street from another recent addition – Neverwinters Thayan enclave, neighboring a trade outpost, and the Wailing Wench Tavern.\nThe temple opened into a spacious chapel with the shrine dedicated to the Merchants Friend in front of pew rows. The interior was decorated with fanciful pastries, statues, and gold-and-red carpets. That was one of the two major sections of the temples first floor. The second section was a collection of offices from where major trade cartels of Neverwinter operated out of. The offices were located to the left of the temples main entrance. As of 1374 DR, three mercantile cartels were authorized to do business out of the church the Circle of Friends, the Forgotten Lords, and the Fated Winds. Each cartel was given an office in the temple at the time, there were only three.\nAll divine services provided by the church were done in the chapel by Manycoins Eramus personally. The Manycoins also accepted meetings in an official capacity on behalf of his church.\nThe Temple of Waukeen was a new addition to the city of Neverwitner, opened shortly after the end of the Shadow War of the  by a personal invitation from Lord Nasher Alagondar. A fire raged across the Tyrs Eye area of the city just after the Shadow War. The fires burned down what used to be a mages school as well as several other buildings. The remnants of the school became the foundation of the Temple of Waukeen, one of the first public buildings opened in Tyrs Eye after the fire, above the Blacklake District. The short but devastating war damaged the Northwest Faerûns trade, and the Church of Waukeen was obliged to aid in financial recovery, sponsoring mercantile organizations trading out of Neverwinter. The Church of Waukeen did not seek to usurp the worship in the city, and the Church of Tyr welcomed Waukeens aid feeling no threat from the new religion."
