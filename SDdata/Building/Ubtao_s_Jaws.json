        "mainbody": "'''Ubtao's Jaws''' was a large, south-facing gate in the exterior walls of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in [[Chult]]. It connected the interior [[Port Nyanzaru/Harbor Ward|Harbor Ward]] and [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] to the exterior slum district of [[Malar's Throat]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|5}}",
        "Location": "The gate sat in the walls of south-central Port Nyanzaru at the mouth of the ravine that formed Malar's Throat. This placement meant that during rains, water runoff down the ravine would pass through the gate to empty into the harbor and the [[Bay of Chult]] beyond.",
        "Defenses": "Whenever Malar's Throat came under attack from jungle monsters or [[undead]], mercenaries on the payroll of the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] would keep them out of the city. However, they would not go out of the gate to defend Malar's Throat.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the waters that flowed through Ubtao's Jaws during heavy rains were known to carry along small unattended items, dead animals, and the occasional person.\n\nThe area just outside the gate was known to be a place where beggars would cluster."
