        "mainbody": "Alger Frakk\nThe Smithy was the local blacksmith of Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.\nThe Smithy was located on the north side of town along the road that connected the town square to the Triboar Trail.\nCustomers entered the Smithy to an open area containing the forge and a number of anvils. The rest of the building was walled off and private.\nPrior to 1495 DR, blacksmithing services were provided by master smith Alger Frakk and his apprentice Maza Fieldsalder. However, beginning that year, Maza took over as the sole smith in the establishment after Algers untimely death. \nIn 1496 DR, rumors circulated in Phandalin suggesting that Algers death was suspicious, and some believed that Maza had good reasons to have killed him. Others dismissed these as slanderous lies spread by someone who wanted to take Mazas job."
