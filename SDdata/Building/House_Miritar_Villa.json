        "mainbody": "The villa of House Miritar was the familial home of the Miritar elven family that lived in the city of Cormanthor long before it was known as \"Myth Drannor\".\nThe villa was located on the Stroll of Minstrels, just south of the Sixstar intersection in the Sheshyrinnam district of the city.\nThe entirety of the villa comprised a single structure that emerged from the ground and three massive, petrified trees that formed the borders of the property and connected to the ground building. The Miritar family residence was the perfect exemplification of organic architecture that was just as resilient as it was stunning in appearance.\nThe central structure of the estate stood 4 stories tall above ground level, while the three trees that framed its grounds extended some 7 stories high.\nAs fitting for one of the Cormanthan noble families, the villa of House Miritar was created by the use of elven high magic.\nEvery season, the familys illusionists would change the color of the trees dwellings petrified leaves in order to better match their surroundings."
