The Miritar family residence was the perfect exemplification of organic architecture that was just as resilient as it was stunning in appearance.\n\nThe central structure of the estate stood 4 stories tall above ground level, while the three trees that framed its grounds extended some 7 stories high.",
        "History": "As fitting for one of the [[Cormanthan]] noble families, the villa of House Miritar was created by the use of [[elven high magic]].\n\nEvery season, the family's [[illusionist]]s would change the color of the trees dwellings' petrified leaves in order to better match their surroundings."
