The '''Artisan's Tomb''' was a mausoleum located in the [[Craftsman's Rest]] area of [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
[[File:Artisans Tomb NVW MMO.webp|thumb|250px|''The tomb interior.'']]
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tomb had been overrun with [[undead]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group of [[gnoll]]s allied with [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] began to use the tomb as their base. These gnolls attracted the attention of the [[Harper]]s when they attacked a scholar named [[Tristopher Chettlebell]] and stole his pack, including his notes and his copy of ''[[The Annals of Neverdeath]]''.
