        "mainbody": "The '''Shattered Sanctum''' was the name given to a ruined [[Selûnite]] temple found in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]]. For a time it served as a crucial stronghold in the regional struggle with the [[drow]] and bastion of light against the forces of darkness aligned with the dark goddess [[Shar]]. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it had fallen into disrepair and became a wicked lair for the [[goblinoid]] horde that had come under the malign influence of the emergent [[Cult of the Absolute]].\n\n{{Quote|A son of Selûne fell here in the dark below,<br />And we sealed his grave in her holy glow<br />May the full moon never touch the stars once more,<br />May darkness never conquer the Moonmaiden's door.|''A poem written about the Shattered Sanctum.}}",
        "Geography": {
            "Geographical Features": "[[File:Shattered_Sanctum_ext_wide.png|thumb|right|350px|A bird's-eye view of the ruined temple and the surrounding landscape.]]\nThe temple was built atop a rocky outcropping that overlooked a waterfall and stream that fed the Chionthar."
        },
        "Structure": "The Shattered Sanctum comprised an outdoor structure built into the side of a rocky cliff face and the underground temple complex found within.\n\nA crumbling stone bridge granted access to the exterior of the temple, a vast stone-tiled courtyard set within tall stone walls. Elevated walkways set atop arcades that extended out from the second level of the temple's façade, atop which sat four domes set stop circular columns. The inner temple was accessible by a set of massive wooden double doors.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "As of the late 15{{th}} century, the atmosphere of the ruined temple of the Selûne remained in stark contrast to that when the temple was first built. Its hallowed halls were defiled by the [[goblinoid]] squatters that transformed it into a fortress of [[the Absolute]] and its valuables were plundered. The temple's walls were vandalized with crude goblinoid drawings, rooms meant for prayer were transformed into torture chambers, and bodies of the cult's victims were butchered into pieces to feed their monstrous pets.\n\nRather than offer veneration to the Moon Goddess, the sanctity of the temple was befouled and it languished as a monument to the depravity of the Absolute and her malevolent lieutenants. The Shattered Sanctum became a haven of debauchery and dread, rather than the enduring light holding back darkness that it once was."
        },
        "Defenses": "The passageway leading beneath the temple to the Underdark was hidden after the drow raid, openable by the correct arrangement of four interlocking stone discs. Each circular stone disk had to be turned in such a way that the phases of the moon inscribed on smaller plates above were set in the preferred order. The intricate mechanism was designed by a converted [[Gond]]ar priestess, who previously worked at the [[Hall of Wonders]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "History": {
            "Origins": "[[File:Selune relief cropped.png|thumb|left|200px|A faded relief of the Moonmaiden.]]\nThe construction and founding of the temple was led by the Selûnite priestess [[Morna]], under guidance from the leadership at the [[House of the Moon]] in [[Waterdeep]]. Sometime early in its formation, High Initiate [[Jarrus]] took a group of novices into the underground tunnels beneath the temple proper. He diverted building materials from the main temple, and began construction of an underground, fortified chapel near a passage to the Underdark.\n\nUnfortunately, Jarrus and the novices were beset by an army of [[drow]] and the elite [[Shar]]ran order of [[Dark Justiciars]]. The Selûnite devotees held out against these forces for a matter of days, but eventually had to sacrifice themselves to save the temple above. Jarrus led a final charge into the drow lines, allowing his companions to collapse the underground temples and prevent the dark elves from advancing.",
            "Cult Takeover": "[[File:Throne room.png|thumb|right|325px|[[Dror Ragzlin]] seated atop his makeshift throne, surrounding by [[the Absolute]]'s cultists.]]\nWhen the emergent [[Cult of the Absolute]] rose to power within the region in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, they overran the abandoned temple and claimed the Shattered Sanctum as their own. The [[hobgoblin]] warlord [[Dror Ragzlin]] rallied the cult's [[goblinoid]] forces at the ruined temple, while High Priestess [[Gut]] branded them with the [[mark of the Absolute]], tightening their control over the will of their followers. \n\nNightwarden [[Minthara Baenre]] meanwhile used the fortress as a launching point for hunting down a ''[[mysterious artifact]]'' sought by the Absolute. She believed the cult's goblinoid forces had to be controlled in order that they did not run amok across the surrounding lands."

        "Rumors & Legends": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, rumors surrounding the treasure known as the ''[[Nightsong]]'' all pointed in the direction of the Shattered Sanctum ruins."
