        "mainbody": "The '''House of Holy Light''' (also seen as the '''House of the Holy Light''') was a shrine dedicated to [[Lathander]] in [[Voonlar]].",
        "Location": "Voonlar was a trading town and farming community located in the southwest corner of the [[Moonsea]] region of [[north Faerûn]]. The shrine itself was on the outskirts of town, just south of the [[Three Elves]] inn on [[Dump Road]], facing east.",
        "Description": "The House of Holy Light was an open pavilion with no walls, just stone pillars holding up a shingled roof. Under the roof were a set of angled stones that served to hold sheets of [[mica]] that were positioned to capture the rays of the rising sun and reflect them in all directions. On the floor was a simple stone altar and braziers. Surrounding the shrine were small beds of [[herbs]] and [[spices]] that anyone could sample as long as they did not take the last specimen of any plant. A sign was posted declaring that anyone breaking this rule would incur the wrath of Lathander.",
        "Activities": "Gentle Father [[Erngar Narrowlea]] and several lay followers took turns tending the shrine and working in the herb garden. He sold glass [[jar]]s of [[holy water]] and wax-stoppered ''[[potion of extra healing|potions of extra healing]]'' to the many travelers that stopped by the shrine in all seasons except winter. A large jar of holy water was 25 gp and a healing potion was 1,100 gp. Over forty local citizens also visited and worshiped at the shrine.",
