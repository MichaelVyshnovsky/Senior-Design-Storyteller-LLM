        "mainbody": "'''Cryptkey Facilitations''' was a business in the [[Skullport/Lower Trade Lanes|Lower Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "Cryptkey Facilitations was a two-story establishment with an expansive basement, operating in fair condition. The building was heavily guarded by [[undead]] creatures, including a formidable skull-headed [[ettin]] [[zombie]] and a swarm of [[crawling claw]]s.",
        "Interior": "To preserve their inventory of corpses prior to reanimation, Cryptkey Facilitations utilized a cool basement and sub-basement, extending the storage space beneath its modest two-story exterior.",
        "Services": "Cryptkey Facilitations primary service lay in the procurement and preparation of corpses, which they carefully stitched and mended as necessary to supply high-quality bodies for reanimation. Utilizing spells such as ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]'' and ''[[preserve dead]]'', the organization ensured that each corpse was in optimal condition for [[necromancy|necromantic]] purposes. They maintained close associations with figures like [[Mhaug]] and [[Dalagor|Dalagor the Cold]].\n\nIn addition to providing bodies for reanimation, Cryptkey Facilitations offered a highly specialized, though costly, exhumation service. For those with the means to pay, the organization retrieved the remains of specific individuals—often heroes or well-known figures—from [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]]. Access to these remains was enabled by a network of concealed passages and gates, allowing for clandestine entry and egress. However, due to the expense involved and the high demand for cheap labor in Skullport, this service was infrequently requested. The cost of recovering such a body varied widely, from hundreds to thousands of [[gold pieces]], influenced by the nature of the burial and circumstances surrounding the individual's death.",
        "Inhabitants": "Cryptkey Facilitations was run by a group of [[thieves]] and [[necromancer]]s who profited by plundering crypts and graves within the City of the Dead. The organization's personnel typically numbered around twelve at any given time, each member wearing stylized [[mask]]s to obscure their identities and maintaining a stoic silence. ''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the operation was led by [[Jasmar'n Shadewidow]], a reserved and introspective woman of notable necromantic skill."
