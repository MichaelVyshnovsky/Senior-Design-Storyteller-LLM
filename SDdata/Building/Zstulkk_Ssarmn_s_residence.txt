Zstulkk Ssarmns residence was a private residence in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
Zstulkk Ssarmns residence was a two-story fortress in good condition, embedded within the stone columns of the Lower Trade Lanes. The building’s exterior featured scaled walls, serpentine columns, and supports crafted to resemble monstrous reptiles. Guarding the front entrance were two muscular, snake-tailed yuan-ti malisons, each armed with polearms and poisoned arrows coated with a lethal venom.
The residence exuded unsettling sounds and scents. Muffled cries and disturbing melodies echoed from within, particularly during the dark hours from midnight to dawn. Spicy, unusual scents and the faint sounds of scales sliding over stone added to the building’s eerie ambiance.
In the depths of the mansion, Zstulkk and his followers have constructed a hidden temple devoted to Sseth. This shrine was a small step pyramid adorned with intricate reptilian carvings, surrounded by magically heated pools and geysers that created a humid, swamp-like environment, ideally suited to the yuan-ti’s needs.
The mansion’s defense system was formidable, consisting of a constant presence of yuan-ti pureblood and halfbreed yuan-ti ready to confront any intruders. Additionally, a menagerie of charmed reptiles—including subterranean and minotaur lizards, giant cobras, and constrictors, patroled the halls, maintaining constant vigilance. The corridors were also laden with hidden traps concealed pits lined with venomous snakes and chutes that descended directly to the inner sanctum of Sseth’s temple.
Only Zstulkks yuan-ti kin entered freely through the gates others brought inside were shackled, rarely reappearing. Zstulkks family members and loyal yuan-ti followers resided in the mansion and its extensive underground levels, which were reputedly populated by enormous, pet reptiles and frequented by devotees of dark yuan-ti deities.
