        "Location": "Bonecloak's Apothecary stood to the north of the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov – Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} and [[Old Town Avenue]].<ref group=\"note\">The game's city map is representative and in no way accurate to the actual layout of Baldur's Gate. This article makes an educated guess that the shop is located on the same plaza as Sorcerous Sundries, both found on the city map. Its position matches the plaza's northwestern block, which is just two buildings, the shop and the spacious Highberry family home. Its next-door neighbor was the Highberry family estate that was known to host [[wine]] festivals.",
        "Structure": "[[File:Bonecloak's Apothecary 2.jpg|thumb|''Bonecloak's Apothecary's interior.''|395x395px]]\nThe apothecary was a flowering [[ivy]]-covered building with two floors and attic space. A small greenhouse was built into the shop's side, and it expanded into a sizable underground cave utilized to grow supplies and serve as a laboratory. The First floor was taken by the shop, and the second floor was used as living quarters by the Bonecloaks.",
        "Services": "One of the substances sold by Bonecloak's was alchemical bloodstain remover–a regular purchase delivered to the [[Szarr Palace]].",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Bonecloak's Apothecary was run by [[Derryth Bonecloak]] and [[Baelen Bonecloak]], a married [[dwarven couple]]. After Baelen was left [[feeblemind]]ed, the business was largely run by Derryth from some half from her simple husband. She prepared concoctions and potions and regularly traveled to the [[Ebonlake Grotto]], a friendly [[myconid]] colony in the [[Underdark]] to resupply and search for an immensely valuable [[noblestalk]] [[mushroom]]. At that time, a stray alley [[cat]] [[Myshka]] might have found a new home with Derryth in the shop. It was unknown if Baelen's mental capabilities were restored with the use of noblestalk to produce a cure."
