        "mainbody": "Bonecloaks Apothecary was a potionmakers shop located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nBonecloaks Apothecary stood to the north of the Sorcerous Sundries shop in the Heapside neighborhood of Baldurs Gate. and Old Town Avenue.The games city map is representative and in no way accurate to the actual layout of Baldurs Gate. This article makes an educated guess that the shop is located on the same plaza as Sorcerous Sundries, both found on the city map. Its position matches the plazas northwestern block, which is just two buildings, the shop and the spacious Highberry family home. Its next-door neighbor was the Highberry family estate that was known to host wine festivals.\nthumb|Bonecloaks Apothecarys interior.|395x395px\nThe apothecary was a flowering ivy-covered building with two floors and attic space. A small greenhouse was built into the shops side, and it expanded into a sizable underground cave utilized to grow supplies and serve as a laboratory. The First floor was taken by the shop, and the second floor was used as living quarters by the Bonecloaks.\nOne of the substances sold by Bonecloaks was alchemical bloodstain removerâ€“a regular purchase delivered to the Szarr Palace.\nIn the late 15 century DR, during the Absolute crisis, Bonecloaks Apothecary was run by Derryth Bonecloak and Baelen Bonecloak, a married dwarven couple. After Baelen was left feebleminded, the business was largely run by Derryth from some half from her simple husband. She prepared concoctions and potions and regularly traveled to the Ebonlake Grotto, a friendly myconid colony in the Underdark to resupply and search for an immensely valuable noblestalk mushroom. At that time, a stray alley cat Myshka might have found a new home with Derryth in the shop. It was unknown if Baelens mental capabilities were restored with the use of noblestalk to produce a cure."
