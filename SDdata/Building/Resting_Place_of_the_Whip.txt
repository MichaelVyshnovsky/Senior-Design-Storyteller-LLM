}}The '''Resting Place of the Whip''' was the temple of [[Loviatar]] in [[Melvaunt]] in the 1370s [[DR]].

The temple had seventeen [[priest]]s, led by High Whipmistress [[Suzildara Sharranen]]. The temple was not particularly popular as worship of Loviatar had decreased significantly by [[1373 DR]]. The church remained thanks in no small part to the alliance they formed with a local cult dedicated to [[Iyachtu Xvim]].
