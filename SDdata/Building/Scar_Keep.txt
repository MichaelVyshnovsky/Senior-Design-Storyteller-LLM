'''Scar Keep''' was a military outpost located in the [[Chasm]] of [[Neverwinter]]. It was used as the headquarters of [[Scar Company]].

==Structure==
Scar Keep was made up of the ruins of a former [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter|Graycloak]] military outpost. The original construction had been [[ward]]ed to protect it from enemy [[spell]]s and [[siege engine]]s, and these [[enchantment]]s had the effect of preserving the building mostly intact when it plunged into the Chasm.

==History==
Scar Keep fell into the Chasm when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}. After the [[The Wall (Neverwinter)|Wall]] of Neverwinter was built, Scar Company used the Keep to protect Neverwinter from the horrors of the Chasm.
