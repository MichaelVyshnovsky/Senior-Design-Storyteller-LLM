The Rolling Gnome was a music store in the town of Felshroun.
The Rolling Gnome sold instruments, sheet music, and touchstones.
The store was run by a group of retired minstrels that included a human couple, an elven man, and two half-elven women who lived within the shops attic. The latter two were known to play strange harp and flute music in the early hours of each day.
* The proprietors of this store were rumored to be members of the Harpers.
* Local gossip in the town claimed that the half-elven sisters played their music at the early hours of each day for sprites and other fey to dance to.
