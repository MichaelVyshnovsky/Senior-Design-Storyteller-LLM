The '''Rolling Gnome''' was a music store in the town of [[Felshroun]].

==Services==
The Rolling Gnome sold instruments, sheet music, and ''[[touchstone]]s''.

==Inhabitants==
The store was run by a group of retired minstrels that included a [[human]] couple, an [[elf|elven]] man, and two [[half-elven]] women who lived within the shop's attic. The latter two were known to play strange [[harp]] and [[flute]] music in the early hours of each day.

==Rumors & Legends==
* The proprietors of this store were rumored to be members of the [[Harpers]].
* Local gossip in the town claimed that the half-elven sisters played their music at the early hours of each day for [[sprite (creature)|sprites]] and other [[fey]] to dance to.
