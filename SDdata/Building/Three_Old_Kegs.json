        "mainbody": "The '''Three Old Kegs''' was a well-known inn found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]]. It was widely regarded as one of the best inns in all of [[Faerûn]], and was known for its comfortable furnishings and generally somnific atmosphere.\n\nThe establishment was located in the [[Temples District]] of the [[Upper City]], along the east wall of the [[Ducal Palace]].",
        "Patronage": "The Kegs' clientele tended to be considerably tamer than that of most inns in Baldur's Gate. The inn catered towards relaxed, easygoing individuals who preferred to spend their days engaging in reading, napping and low-stakes gambling.",
        "Description": {
            "Decor": "The inn was furnished with old, comfortable, and slightly shabby furniture culled from a dozen keeps and many homes of rich and poor. The walls are crowded with trophy heads of creatures, from local [[deer]] to monstrosities of the deep, old fading paintings of fanciful and imaginative scenes, and thick tapestries from several score of cultures. These decorations were complemented by large bookcases and shelves crowded with old diaries, travel logs, collections of ballads and legends, and colorful history books of dubious accuracy. The floors were covered in thick rugs made from a wide variety of beasts."
        },
        "Staff": "During the mid—14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Three Old Kegs was kept by [[Nantrin Bellowglyn]], a retired nobleman's guard from [[Tethyr]]. The staff consists of Bellowglyn’s four daughters, a bag-boy, a hostler, and three serving wenches. The latter are former huntresses from Tethyr and one of them, [[Ithtyl Calantryn]], is a sorceress adept in the fields of levitation and shielding spells. She has been known to singlehandedly defenestrate would-be thieves and unruly patrons.\n\nWhile quietly polite and uniformly thoughtful, the Kegs' staff, especially Bellowglyn, did not tolerate rowdiness or violence. Those who drank too much during an evening would often awake in the hay pile by the kitchen door. Patrons were expected to leave their weapons in their rooms, a rule of the inn that was firmly enforced. To the majority of patrons who behaved, the service was unfailingly excellent. The staff was even known to take the time to chat or play games with bored or lonely patrons, although they would never gamble for money.\n\n[[File:three old kegs.png|thumb|''Three Old Kegs as depicted in the game ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' This Inn can be visited in the game Baldur's Gate, it can be found in the NE section of the city.'']]\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the inn was run by the Wintersides brothers, collectively known as the \"Three Toads\". These bleeding-heart altruists regularly opened the Kegs' doors to the city's orphans and widows. Unfortunately, their generosity was sometimes met with fraud and exploitation.",
        "Services": {
            "Prices": "''Circa'' mid—14{{th}} century DR:\n* Rooms were 5 [[sp]]/person/night. Rooms range from single occupancy to quad, but there was no discount for sharing a room. Price includes stabling, a plate of bread, a mug of broth, bottomless ice water, cold baths and laundry service.\n* Additional meals were 1 [[cp]]/plate.\n* All wines were 6 cp/tallglass.\n* A hot bath was 3 cp/person.\n* Corpse disposal was 100 [[gp]]/body."
