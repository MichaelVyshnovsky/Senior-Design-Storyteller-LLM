        "mainbody": "The Lorious Inn, most often called just the Lorious, was an upscale inn in Veltalar as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe Lorious Inn was in Veltalar.\nThe front door was wide.\nThe Lorious entrance hall was packed with tables draped with red fabric. The saloon past the entrance hall had a bit of haze due to the burning incenses and pipes within the room. Within the Lorious, there were only magical lights.\nThe hallways leading to the rooms had golden lamps, and tapestries. There were plaques announcing the latter were looted from the ruins of Mulhorand.\nThe lead-lined vaults had marble interiors.\nThe Lorious was counted among the citys finer establishments a days stay cost five gold pieces at its rooms with adjoining lead-lined vaults, more than twice what other upscale suites cost.\nFor those in dire need of privacy, and due to the volume of money that changed hands inside, the Lorious offered suites with lead-lined vaults.\nIn , Japheth Donard rented a room at the Lorious Inn, where he kept the body of Anusha Marhana as he arranged to return her wandering soul to her.\nThe three of them discussed their next move at the casino saloon afterwards."
