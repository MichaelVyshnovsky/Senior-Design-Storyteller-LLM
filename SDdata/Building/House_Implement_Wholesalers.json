The top four floors of the five-story building were dedicated to the magical workshops of the artisans who produced the wide array of quasimagical items that were sold. They specialized in relatively simple, everyday items of convenience that made life more comfortable for the enclave-dwelling [[Netherese]], ranging from small portable devices to massive, heavy fixtures. Their most popular items for sale included the ''[[hot waterpipe]]'', ''[[ice box]]'', ''[[music box (Netherese)|music box]]'', ''[[Stoker's pit]]'', ''[[Stoker's veritable pit]]'', and ''[[water pipe]]''."
