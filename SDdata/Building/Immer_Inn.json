        "mainbody": "The '''Immer Inn''' was a lavish inn found in [[Immersea]] known for its superb wine selection and exorbitant prices.",
        "Description": "The proprietors spared no expense in an attempt to make this former manor house resemble a palace of sorts. Decorations included gilded columns, brass fern planters, and carved wind charms.",
        "Activity": "At 30 [[gold|gold pieces]] per night the Immer Inn was easily the most expensive place to sleep in Immersea. Each guest was afforded a personal waiter and chambermaids were available on each floor who could be summoned by ringing a bell.\n\nThough there were no single rooms to be had, each suite was connected to a bath chamber, receiving room, and wardrobe. A pair of bedrooms were connected to each suite and were utterly sound-proofed."
