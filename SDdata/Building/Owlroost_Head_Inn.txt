The '''Owlroost Head''' was a ramshackle inn located in the [[Amnian]] town of [[Purskul]] and named after the [[Owlroost Head (hill)|hill]] of the same name.

==Description==
Owlroost Head was a tumbledown inn, inside and out. It was a collection of small warehouse buildings, barns, and homes connected by shabby passages, all roofed but ramshackle in construction. The interior was just as impressive, filled with mismatched old furniture. The inn was infested with [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and [[cat]]s who chased and devoured the vermin on occasion. Among other inhabitants, Owlroost Head was run by a collection of eccentric employees.

===Atmosphere===
The interior was painted and decorated in lush [[Tethyr]]ean greens and flame-yellow colors that promoted a cheerful and uplifting atmosphere in the Owlroost Head.

==Services==
The establishment lacked quality services and was overpriced. The rooms were of various sizes and varied in furnishings. The rooms were heated by firestones, which were limited in number and were available first-come-first-serve.

However, the Owlroost Head served decent quality fare available from its dining hall. The inn offered a wide selection of [[wine]]s. However, the selection was chaotic and ever-changing, seldom repeating. The local specialty dishes that were served to the customers were quite notable. [[Emerald Chicken]] dish was a flame-[[spice]]d collection of chopped greens, [[onion]]s, [[rice]], [[chicken liver]]s, and other poultry bits. It was just as popular as the inn's juicy [[pork dumplings|dumplings]] in a crispy shell and stuffed with minced [[pork]]. [[Ornabra]] was a more modestly-priced fare, a type of stew served to travelers and caravaners. Among other dishes on offer were various roasts, local river [[fish]] (usually [[eel]]), fluffy [[lemon]]-flavored [[potato]] [[Cloaks (food)|cloaks]], [[squid]]-stuffed [[yam]]s, and [[fried bones salad]].

==History==
The inn's name came from the password used by a local secret society â€“ the [[Many-Fanged Serpent]], during their meetings in the establishment. The password of Owlroost Head was the name of a hill to the east of Purskul. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the organization was believed to be gone, leaving behind only the inn's new name and occasional swearing "By the Serpent," or hushed rumors of events attributed to the group. One such rumor was the Many-Fanged Serpent's treasure was buried somewhere under the inn's dining hall. This belief was speculated to have been the inn's main attraction and reason for existence.

At one point in the late 14{{th}} century DR, Owlroost Head Inn stopped hiring on-staff nigh-companions for the inn's guests after a group of them turned out to be [[doppelganger]] murderers. The inn also received a favorable mention in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s guide book that covered the nations of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]].
