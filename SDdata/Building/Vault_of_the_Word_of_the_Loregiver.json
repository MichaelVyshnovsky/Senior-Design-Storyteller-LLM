These precious scrolls were displayed for all to see, but kept safely behind walls of force.\nIn addition to the walls of force protecting the vault, many magical protective measures were used to guard the ancient scrolls.\nA tasked slayer genie lay hidden within the base of the stand holding the scrolls, ready to spring out and destroy any intruder or thief with unbridled fury."
