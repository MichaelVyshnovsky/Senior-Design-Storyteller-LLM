The Smoking Hammer Shrine was a temple located in the City of Brass in 1367 DR.
Though scant information was available on the Smoking Hammer Shrine, it was said to be quite ugly and strange.
This temple was dedicated to Surtur, a giant god of fire and steel. The genies of the City of Brass did not worship Surtr, but they allowed some of their servants to erect the shrine nonetheless.
The Shrine was guarded night and day by attentive fire giants.
