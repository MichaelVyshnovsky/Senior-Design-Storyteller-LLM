The '''Smoking Hammer Shrine''' was a temple located in the [[City of Brass]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
Though scant information was available on the Smoking Hammer Shrine, it was said to be quite ugly and strange.

==Inhabitants==
The Shrine was guarded night and day by attentive [[fire giant]]s.
