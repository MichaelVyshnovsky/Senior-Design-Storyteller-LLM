        "mainbody": "onstables Tower was an imposing keep with a tall tower, standing high over the town of Dagger Falls.\nThe tower stood at the highest point in town within the walls, on the north side, opposite the Forest Gate.\nConstables Tower was a fortified keep with a tall, crenelated round tower. Its already daunting height made all the more impressive as it sat 100ft above, a top a hill known as the Spur. It was noted as the largest of its sort between the Citadel of the Raven and Cormyr. Crowning the central keep are once-deadly ballistae and mangonels. \nProtruding to the east and west of the tower were two wooden gallery wings, each covered with slate shingle and metal plates to ensure they are protected from fires. At the end of these wings are balconies.\nBeneath the Tower are numerous cellars and dungeons, some of which even have secret passages connecting to the tomb of Colderan Morn and eventually the Underdark.\nAfter the death of its last owner, Ilthond, the stronghlold had been affected by some strange persistent magical effect that made the tower unlivable blasts of elemental energy occurred randomly and the resulting damage was subsequently repaired by another recurring magical effect in a never-ending cycle.\nRebuilt many times over the centuries, this once-isolated keep belonged to Colderan Morn in the times before Zhent rule.\nThe tower became known as the Constables Tower during the period of Zhentish occupation under Constable Tren Noemfor after 1353 DR. However, in 1369 DR,, the wizard Ilthond claimed the tower as his own and during a magical battle with the demi-shade, Gothyl, he was killed. Since then the tower was subjected to bizarre cycles of magic.\nAs of 1372 DR, Lord Randal Morn was interested in taking over the tower as his seat of power. To this end he offered 5,000 gold pieces, land, and title to anyone who could make the keep habitable once more.\nSupposedly, at least half a dozen potent archmages have attempted to investigate Constables tower but have either fled or died from the towers wild magic. Among these was said to include Vangerdahast Aeiulvana of Cormyr.\n*Colderan Morn\n*Ilthond\n*Tren Noemfor\nCategoryTowers\nCategoryKeeps\nCategoryLocations in Dagger Falls\nCategoryLocations in Daggerdale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nh7jdkdgj6cqknenzsp9rxtnzypvfxhy"
