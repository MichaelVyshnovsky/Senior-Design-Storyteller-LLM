Draconic Dinery was a restaurant run, allegedly, by dragons in the late 15 century DR.
Draconic Dinery was opened in the late 15 century DR. The eatery advertised itself via street criers in the citys Dock Ward. If the advertisement was to be believed, Draconic Dinery was home to "genuine dragons of Faer√ªn," who were dancers entertaining the clientele, owners, and clients, and, more shockingly, the dragons were also served as food. The special on offer was a dish called dragonfly stew, served with "kaijhou-simmered organs." And the advertisement promised a special appearance of a mutated deep dragon. However, how much truth, if any, was in the advertisement remained unknown.
