'''Draconic Dinery''' was a restaurant run, allegedly, by [[dragon]]s in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Draconic Dinery was opened in the late 15{{th}} century DR. The eatery advertised itself via street criers in the city's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. If the advertisement was to be believed, Draconic Dinery was home to "genuine dragons of [[Faer√ªn]]," who were dancers entertaining the clientele, owners, and clients, and, more shockingly, the dragons were also served as food. The special on offer was a dish called [[dragonfly stew]], served with "kaijhou-simmered organs." And the advertisement promised a special appearance of a mutated [[deep dragon]]. However, how much truth, if any, was in the advertisement remained unknown.
