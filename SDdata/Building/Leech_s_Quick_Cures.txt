'''Leech's Quick Cures''' was a shop in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
Leech's Quick Cures was owned by [[Leech (human)|Leech]], a nervous [[human]] and [[healer]] known for his medical services and specializing in quick recovery.

==Services==
Leech provided services such as suturing wounds, setting broken bones, and removing [[poison]]s for a nominal fee. He was particularly known for his ability to get individuals back on their feet in an hour or less through a combination of chirurgery, herbal remedies, and bloodletting. The costs for minor healing and remedies varied depending on the severity of the ailment.

Leech's chirurgery, a skill he acquired from a [[Calishite]] physician with a notorious reputation, was a procedure that took approximately one hour and required the patient to rest for 24 hours after the operation. Should the patient fail to rest, all natural healing was suspended for the day, and there was a 50% chance of contracting a blood disease. While patients could engage in light conversation and minimal travel, any form of physical exertion halted the healing process. The cost for chirurgery was 10 [[gp]].

Leech developed a method for removing poisons using [[giant leech]]es. For injected poisons, a leech was applied to the injection site, and the process took several minutes. During this time, the effects of the poison were halted while the leech extracted the poison. For ingested poisons, the leech was placed on the patient's torso. The cost of poison removal was typically 20 gold pieces, which covered the cost of replacing the leech, as it was killed by the poison during the process.

Leech also offered a range of herbal balms, salves, and other medicinal materials, such as [[bandage]]s and [[splint]]s. These items ranged in price from 5 [[sp]] to 10 gold pieces per use. While these remedies were mildly effective, they were in high demand among those seeking basic medical care.

In cases where patients died on Leech's operating table, their bodies were unceremoniously piled into a [[wheelbarrow]] and transported to [[Mhaug's]]. [[Mhaug]] compensated Leech for the corpses, paying between 25 and 35 gp per body, depending on the condition of the remains. This side arrangement ensured that even Leech's failed treatments had a profitable outcome.
