Sschindylryns Gate was a portal on an island in the Darklake in the Northdark.
The portal was discovered by scouts from the city of Sschindylryn, a drow city under Cormyr known for its use of portals to explore and conquer other parts of the Underdark. During a battle with Menzoberranzan, the portal was damaged and none from the western city knew how to operate it or to where it led.
