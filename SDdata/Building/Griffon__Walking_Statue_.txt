The Walking Statue of Waterdeep known as the Griffon materialized in Waterdeep  in 1479 DR in response to an attempted intrusion into Ahghairons Tower. After flying over the city, it came to rest facing southeast toward the Dock Ward on Mount Waterdeep near Peaktop Aerie. Due to its location, many believed it was simply a monument to the Griffon Cavalry, but that was not true.
The statue itself appeared as its name implies—a griffon standing on all four legs, although it was approximately twenty feet tall and made of granite.
