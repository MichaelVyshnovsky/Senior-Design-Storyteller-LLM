El '''Daraqadim''' was a former [[Calimshan|Calishite]] manor located in [[Calimmon|Calimmon County]] in [[Tethyr]] and was one of the keeps of the duke of [[Ankaram|Ankramir]] before the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum period]]. After the [[Tethyrian Interregnum#Reclamation Wars|Reclamation Wars]], the keep became the county seat of Calimmon and the home of Her Excellency [[Kyrin Hawkwinter]].

Countess Hawkwinter prefered to call the manor '''The Cliff''', instead of its old [[Alzhedo]] name.

==Location==
The keep was located 25 miles directly north of [[Memnon]]. The nearest major Tethyrian city was [[Myratma]], to the north.

As the countess's name for it suggests, Daraqadim rested on the edge of the coastal cliffs overlooking the [[Sea of Swords]].

==Structure==
The Cliff had the typical features of Calishite construction&mdash;large windows and breezeways, spacious balconies, gardens, and halls. Lady Kyrin had her friend Lord [[Zelphar Thann]] design and upgrade the keep's defenses. She also had the stable enlarged for her many horses.<ref>
