The '''House of Cyric''' was a temple to [[Cyric]] located in [[Skullport]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.
==Location==
Skullport was located in [[Undermountain]] beneath [[Waterdeep]], and perhaps more importantly, beneath [[Mount Waterdeep]], a holy site to followers of Cyric as it had been where their god ascended from [[human]] to [[deity]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].
==Defenses==
The temple was one of only a few places in all of [[Faer√ªn]] in which [[banelar naga]]s loyal to Cyric were known to dwell.

==History==
Prior to the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the only presence of the [[church of Cyric]] in Skullport was a small cult&mdash;little more than a [[skulker gang|gang]]&mdash;that was looking to amass converts. The original members of this cult were seven [[cleric]]s of Cyric banished to [[Undermountain]] by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. These seven found their way to Skullport, and in about three years they grew their ranks to include five more clerics and over thirty lay followers under the leadership of the charismatic priest [[Menes Azludde]].

Operating the cult as little more than a criminal organization, Menes began pursuing ambitions beyond the scope of his real powers, and attempted to set in motion a tangled conspiracy meant to sow chaos and upend the status quo in Skullport. This, of course, attracted the ire of most of the Shadow Port's major players, including the [[Harpers]], the [[Agents of the Eye]], the [[Dark Dagger]], the [[Keepers]], and the [[Iron Ring]]. Ultimately, the cult caught the attention of the [[Skulls of Skullport]] themselves, which was essentially a death sentence.

Nevertheless, by early in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the House of Cyric had been established, and had become a prominent place of the Black Sun's worship on par with the [[Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse]] in [[Amn]]. Notably, it hosted banelar nagas, powerful creatures which had been loyal to [[Bane]] before that deity's death fourteen years prior. Following Bane's return later that year, most banelars returned to their former god, however at least one retained its alliance with Cyric and the House.
