        "mainbody": "'''The Six Shields''' was an inn in the town of [[Llorkh]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
        "History": "It opened some time after the [[Zhentarim]] takeover of Llorkh in [[1357 DR]], less than a month after [[Worried Wyvern (Llorkh)|the only inn]] in town burned down after [[Phintarn's brother|its owner]] died. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly inns. The Six Shields was in business by [[1366 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "A three-story inn resembling a barn, it was frequented by soldiers of the [[Lord's Men]] and the [[Zhentilar]], roughnecks who often tracked in mud and sharpened their swords at their tables and filled the air with pipe-smoke. It was little more than a Zhent barracks."
