        "mainbody": "The '''Shrine of the Flaming Sword''' was an old shrine dedicated to [[Tempus]], found within the village of [[Good Mead]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Structure": "The large structure was built with a distinct steeple atop its roof. It attracted large numbers of [[crow]]s.",

        "Services": "Brother [[Sharamod]] of the Tempuran clergy hoped to one day transform the shrine into a true and proper temple. Unfortuantely for him this would not come to pass.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the shrine was largely empty and was only used as an occasional meeting place by the people of Good Mead.",
        "History": "The Shrine of the Flaming Sword was built some time during or before the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR. It became very popular among the [[Tempuran]] faithful during the years when Good Mead held a strong rivalry with nearby [[Dougan's Hole]]."
