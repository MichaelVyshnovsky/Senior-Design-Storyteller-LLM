'''Eo'tzi Gompa''' was a monastery (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]].

==History==
When [[yeti]] emerged from the [[Wu Pi Te Shar]] mountains and raided [[Nafeen Gompa]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, the dzong-pon (sheriff) of [[Thok]] district organized a hunting expedition against them, distributing printed handbills around southwestern Tabot. Among the first volunteers were 25 people from Eo'tzi Gompa, who quickly went to Nafeen.
