        "mainbody": "aristas were simple living structures built by the Numtanajd people of the High Desert in west Zakhara.\nThe harista served as the permanent home of the Numtanajd. The main structure of a harista was a cylindrical wooden frame laced with grass. It was strengthened with mud and stones. The walls were thick enough to keep the inside relatively cool during the hottest part of the day in the scorching High Desert. Haristas were usually oriented next to each other in tight circles. The central area was used to house their herd animals at night for protection from predators."
