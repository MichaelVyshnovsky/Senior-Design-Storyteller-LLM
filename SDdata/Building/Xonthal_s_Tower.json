        "mainbody": "Xonthals Tower was a tower in the Western Heartlands that housed the wizard Xonthal after 1361 DR.\nThe tower became famous in the Realms for its unusual magical defenses, including the magical hedge maze that surrounded it.\nIn 1365â€“1366 DR, a group of Zhentarim under Hansibal Droun, a shopkeeper of the village near the tower, tried to conquer it for its strategic commercial value. However, Xonthal always defeated them.\nJust before the Tyranny of Dragons, the Cult of the Dragon managed to acquire the tower.\nDuring the Tyranny, the Cults leaders based at the Tower were the dracolich traditionalists Jorgen Pawl and his lieutenant Iskander."
