        "mainbody": "lint Rock, also written as Flintrock, was the ancestral mound of the Elk tribe of Uthgardt barbarians located in the Evermoors region of the Savage Frontier. It was used for veneration of the of the Elk beast totem of the god Uthgar.  It was a set of concentric hills, with a central depression that was shaped like the profile of a leaping elk.\nthumb|left|A map of the Evermoors, showing Flint Rock in the southwestern hills.\nFlint Rock was found in the southeastern Surbrin Hills that lay in the southwestern part of the Evermoors,\nElk were known to live in and around the mounds.\nthumb|right|250px|An overhead view of Flint Rock (right), compared to a regular circular mound (left). Note the elk-shaped inner vale.\nWhereas most Uthgardt ancestral mounds were of earth, Like many Uthgardt ancestral mounds, it was shaped roughly like its totem beast, with the inner vale resembling a leaping elk stag if seen from above.\nThe outer ring held a number of cairns, in which were interred the remains of the Elk tribes most exceptional champions.\nThe inner ring bore four menhirs of gray stone, with one in each of the cardinal directions Between them stood twelve totem poles. With these, shamans could track the seasons, the calendar dates, and the stars.\nAt the very center of Flint Rock was a massive stone slab that served as the altar. Rectangular in shape and with smooth-worn surfaces, it was  by  and  high and weighed several tons.\nBuried beneath the central altar was a spearhead taken from a magical giant-crafted spear—a massive piece of mithral weighing  and  in length. It emanated a faint aura of divination magic to the likes of a detect magic spell, but whatever powers it had had faded by the late 1400s DR. It was considered a relic of the giants of the North.\nA sacred burial ground, it was here where the most accomplished chiefs and shamans of the Elk tribe were interred.\nMembers of the Elk tribe also held their Runemeet at Flint Rock each year on the autumn equinox. Here, like other Uthgardt tribes, they would venerate the Elk totem of Uthgar, make laws and policies, hold marriages and funerals, and celebrate births and formalize adoptions. Meanwhile, both experienced warriors and youths seeking to be accepted as adults undertook a hunt of a ritual enemy, who for the Elk tribe was \"the ancient ones\"—in practice, any ruin, tomb, or sign of a lost civilization counted.\nHowever, every autumn, the orcs of the Evermoors would also gather and make plans to attack the humans during their Runemeet, so they could serve as a ritual enemy too.\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, when the Elk tribe had turned to other, darker gods, Flint Rock was near-deserted and only a few still came here for Runemeets.\nIn ancient times, early followers of Uthgar who would found the Elk tribe interred the magical giant-crafted mithral spearhead under the altar at Flint Rock to empower the ancestral mound.\nIn the , the Uthgardt Alliance stood against an army of goblins and orcs led by ogres that marched out of the Evermoors. Though the Uthgardt defeated the horde, the Elk tribe warriors were nearly annihilated when they defended the Flintrock ancestral mound. The loss of the Uthgardt warriors and the suffering of the tribes led to the dissolution of the Alliance over the following five years. In the aftermath, the Elk tribe was close to dying out. Though they survived, they eventually became not much more than bandits.\nBy the , the ancestral mound was nearly abandoned, yet it was still used during Runemeets at that time.\nBy the 1480s DR, Flint Rock seemed in better condition, but it was not uncommon to find no one there.\nAny hunters or adventurers who harmed or slew an elk while in proximity to the ancestral mound risked being cursed. Thereafter, their wounds would not heal naturally and they were treated as hated enemies of the Elk tribe, until the curse was lifted.\n* Berchtwald Bandyleg, shaman of the Elk totem of Uthgar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He led the rites at Flint Rock."
