        "mainbody": "'''Lord Orgauth's Complex''', which was also called '''Orgauth's Manse''', was the home of Lord [[Orgauth]] in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The complex was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] just off of [[Bridge Street]] near the [[South Tesh Gate]].",
        "Description": "Lord Orgauth's Complex included several towers and an entire subterranean section.",
        "Interior": "The interior of the complex was decorated with exotic furnishings fit for a ruler. The scene was quite different underground where a series of dark cells, torture chambers, summoning rooms, and a fixed portal to [[Baator]] could be found. A tunnel beneath the compound connected with the nearby [[Hall of Rulership]] and a secret location outside of the main city wall.",
        "Defenses": "A ''[[protection from good]]'' [[spell]] covered every section of the complex. Each wall was warded with magic to prevent anyone from entering except by way of the main doors or planar gate. A patrol of six [[Zhentilar]] soldiers constantly walked the grounds outside of the complex.",
        "Inhabitants": "A [[pit fiend]] named [[Abarax]] masqueraded as Lord Orgauth for some time and used the complex as his base during that time.",
        "History": "The complex was initially the home of a wealthy ambassador from [[Thay]]."
