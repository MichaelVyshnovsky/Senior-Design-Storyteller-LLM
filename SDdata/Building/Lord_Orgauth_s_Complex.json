        "mainbody": "ord Orgauths Complex, which was also called Orgauths Manse, was the home of Lord Orgauth in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe complex was located in south Zhentil Keep in the far eastern section of the Foreign Quarter just off of Bridge Street near the South Tesh Gate.\nLord Orgauths Complex included several towers and an entire subterranean section.\nThe interior of the complex was decorated with exotic furnishings fit for a ruler. The scene was quite different underground where a series of dark cells, torture chambers, summoning rooms, and a fixed portal to Baator could be found. A tunnel beneath the compound connected with the nearby Hall of Rulership and a secret location outside of the main city wall.\nA protection from good spell covered every section of the complex. Each wall was warded with magic to prevent anyone from entering except by way of the main doors or planar gate. A patrol of six Zhentilar soldiers constantly walked the grounds outside of the complex.\nA pit fiend named Abarax masqueraded as Lord Orgauth for some time and used the complex as his base during that time.\nThe complex was initially the home of a wealthy ambassador from Thay."
