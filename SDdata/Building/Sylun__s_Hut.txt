'''Syluné's Hut''' was once the home of [[Syluné]], the Witch of [[Shadowdale]]. After her destruction, Syluné's Hut became little more than an empty, roofless house.

==History==
When Syluné perished protecting the village from a flight of [[dragon]]s in [[1356 DR]], her hut and the land it resided on passed to [[Mourngrym Amcathra|Lord Mourngrym]]. Mourngrym refused all attempts to claim, build, and farm on this land, which was still in a blasted condition after the dragon attacks.

==Rumors==
There were rumors claiming there were ''[[portal]]''s near Syluné's Hut, which linked to other [[plane]]s.
