Old Stonebows, also known as Jalias, was an inn located in the city of Archenbridge during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was said to be the best inn of all Archendale. 
The inn was located on the intersection between Urserpent Street and the road coming from the Arkhen Bridge, across the street from the Old Dragon Down shop.

The inn was known for serving succulent food such as hot soups, venison, or spiced fowl at any time of the day. During daytime it featured an extensive menu including delicacies such as smoked fish, roast boar, river eel platters and quail in wine. Meals were quite expensive, costing 9 gp a head (before accounting for the drinks).
Every guest was provided with a a handsome fluffy robe embroidered with the inns badge, which they usually wore down to the pool.
Jalia Mossgreen was known to send bounty hunters after guests who left with one of the inns robes by mistake.
