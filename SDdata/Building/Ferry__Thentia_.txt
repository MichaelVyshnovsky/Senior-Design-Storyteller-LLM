The Ferry was the ferry that served Thentia. It was overseen by ex-Watchlord Kaulyx Raemooutha in 1367 DR.
The Ferry buildings sat in the far south-eastern corner of Thentia, adjacent to the docks and just under the citys wall.
The Ferry consisted of several docks, a comfortable waiting area, an office, and two small warehouses.
The Ferry operated light wave-runner boats that ran routes between Thentia, Melvaunt, and Hillsfar. They left Thentia regularly at sunrise, midmorning, midday, midafternoon, and sunset, with only midmorning and midafternoon operating in winter.
