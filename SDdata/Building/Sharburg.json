        "Description": "As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, Sharburg comprised a lone tower, encircled by a low stone wall. complete with a military barracks, an armory, dungeons, and stables.",
        "Location": "It was located in Tasseldale, relatively close to [[Essembra]] in neighboring [[Battledale]]. It was an isolated fortification, that was several miles southwest of the nearest Essembran manor-house.\n\nOne of the landmarks nearest to Sharburg was the inn of [[Markhouse]], found near [[Tegal's Mark]].",
        "Activities": "For some time, the keep served as the headquarters for Tasseldale's [[Mairshar]]s, as well as an audience chamber for the Grand Mairshar. Tasseldale's constabulary, along with local guardsmen, also used the keep as meeting place to conduct business.",
        "Trade": "''Circa'' the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century, Sharburg's main claim to fame was an exquisite and expensive dish, [[Beef Sharburg]], sometimes served with [[Marsember]] [[beet]]s and followed up with a bowl of [[eldritch berry custard]]. The dish could be found as far from the Dalelands as the town of [[Daggerford]] on the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|I wonder what the Mairshars think of that? The Sharburg was the stronghold of Tasseldale's constables, guards, and lawkeepers...but it seemed that the Sembian lords had evicted them when they chose the Sharburg for their headquarters.|[[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]]'s thoughts on his abduction, [[1374 DR]].}}\n\nThe tower Sharburg was originally built atop an old [[elven]] watchtower that had fallen to disrepair. It was fortified several times over the years, and was a fully-functioning military outpost for the Mairshars, as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.\n\nThe keep did not remain an asset for the army of Tasseldale for long unfortunately. Sometime during or before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Sembia]] invaded Tasseldale, and took over Sharburg for their own. In [[Eleasis]] of that year, [[Ilsevele Miritar]], [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]] and other emissaries of the [[Elven Crusade]] were escorted to Sharburg, by their \"host\" [[Miklos Selkirk]] of the noble Sembian [[Selkirk]] family. They were held under guard for a time, \"for their own protection\".\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1441}}, Sharburg had become the home of family of eccentric artists from Sembia. They gradually repaired the old keep, renovating it into a manor house. They used their new home to craft pottery, carve sculptures, and create other artistic goods. They tended their own crops, pleased to be away from the constant demands of Sembian fine society.",
        "Inhabitants": "Among the family that took up residence in Sharburg were at least two [[wizard]]s, who defended their fellows from any invading threats.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to local legends, if anyone spoke a specific phrase within Sharburg, a spectral door would appear, leading into an old elven [[safehold]] full of arcane weaponry."
