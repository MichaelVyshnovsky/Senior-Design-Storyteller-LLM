While there he took time to note down aspects of the tavern and its atmosphere before speaking with Arik, who he mistook to be its owner. From Arik the man was regaled with the layout of the domain Barovia, given the names of the many notable locations one could find within it.\n\nAfter informing Arik that he had been recommended the tavern by Ezmerelda, he suggested to Volo that he seek out another newcomer, a [[half-elf]] [[bard]] named [[Rictavio]] that resided in the village of [[Vallaki]] across [[Lake Baratok]]. Intrigued by his words, Volo stayed the night and headed out in search of Rictavio the next morning.{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}\n\nAt some point a group of adventurers from Toril, who had been helping the [[Harpell]]s track down a missing [[owlbear]], wandered into Barovia and took shelter in the tavern against the hordes of monsters chasing after them. Therein they fought against [[bat]]s, [[giant rat]]s, and a [[skeleton|minotaur skeleton]].<ref>"
