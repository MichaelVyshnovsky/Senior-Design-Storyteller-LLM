        "mainbody": "Darian Stables was the primary source of horses for traders, adventurers in or locals of Highmoon in the late 14 century DR. Their steeds and draft horses were fostered by Alamus Darian, a horse breeder from Impiltur. In addition to the standard variety of horses, the stables also offered tack and harnesses and sporadically made available a selection of trained warhorses."
