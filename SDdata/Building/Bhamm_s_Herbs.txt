Bhamms Herbs was a shop in Eshpurta run by Eudhis Bhamm.
Bhamms Herbs was located in the southern part of the city, next door to Gray Goose Provisioners, and across the street and a short walk south of the Hamstrung Giant.
The arcane arts were frowned upon in Amn and Eudhis would deny he had anything in stock (other than herbs) that could be considered a spell component. Inquiries were often met with ridicule and scorn. Persistent buyers with ready coin would eventually be escorted to his "compounding room" where a vast array of spell components were available for double the prices found in other countries.
