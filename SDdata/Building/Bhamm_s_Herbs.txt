'''Bhamm's Herbs''' was a shop in [[Eshpurta]] run by [[Eudhis Bhamm]].

==Location==
Bhamm's Herbs was located in the southern part of the city, next door to [[Gray Goose Provisioners]], and across the street and a short walk south of the [[Hamstrung Giant]].

==Services==
The [[arcane]] arts were frowned upon in Amn and Eudhis would deny he had anything in stock (other than [[herb]]s) that could be considered a spell component. Inquiries were often met with ridicule and scorn. Persistent buyers with ready coin would eventually be escorted to his "compounding room" where a vast array of spell components were available for double the prices found in other countries.
