'''The Rapids''' was the only [[inn]] left standing in [[Teshwave]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
The Rapids was run by four citizens of Teshwaveâ€”[[Hallorfan Teshdale]], [[Tula Woodsbridge]], [[Doryn]], and [[Calla Ayetes]]. In reality they were little more than indentured servants forced to cook, clean, and brew [[ale]] by the [[Zhentilar]] troops stationed in the town.
