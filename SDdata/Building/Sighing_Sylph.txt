The '''Sighing Sylph''' was a quiet, and fairly unremarkable tavern found on [[Northwind street]], within the city of [[Sundabar]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The tavern drew its name from its only real notable feature: a life-size wooden statue of an indecent [[sylph]] that stood by its front entrance. 

In addition to being rather tasteless in its design, the locals of Sundabar would often play equally childish pranks on the sylph. For example, some mischevious locals would relocate the statue to various locations throughout city, such as perched upon another building or within the cloister of a local [[temple]]. Alternately, they would paint the sylph garish colors or cast [[cantrip]]s to enchant her appearance or have her say particularly rude phrases.
