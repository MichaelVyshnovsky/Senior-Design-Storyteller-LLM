The '''Bright Anvil''' was a small temple dedicated to [[Gond]] within the fortified city of [[Yeshpek]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Activity in this temple was relatively quiet, but it maintained an impressive degree of steady income through charitable donations of [[coin]]s that were made by almost all of Yeshpek's craftworkers. The temple divided this income evenly between two different avenues of charity. The first was to the less fortunate, needy and sick of Yeshpek. Their other use of this income was to encourage in the community new designs, inventions, and methods of working.
