        "mainbody": "he Roaring Dragon was a large tavern found in Zhentil Keep in 1358 DR.\nThe Roaring Dragon was located in Zhentil Keeps Inner Quarter near the center along the southern wall of the Harbor District.\nThe Roaring Dragon was one of the better taverns to be found in Zhentil Keep and the owners knew it. Everything inside of the tavern was expensive. A large stage provided plenty of room for hired entertainment, bringing a bit of joy to the Zhents frequenting the tavern. After sundown the Roaring Dragon catered only to members of the Zhentilar or particularly brave individuals. A gong was sounded signaling the time when the common Zhent was invited to leave at sundown."
