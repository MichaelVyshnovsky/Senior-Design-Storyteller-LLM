        "mainbody": "underside was a small but palatial mansion owned by the Ampner family of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR, located within the citys Temple District. Despite its size, the manor was divided into unassuming rental apartments that were particularly well-decorated. The noble Ampners maintained one of the suits as a sort of domestic getaway, when they wished to stay in the city without letting others know of their whereabouts. \nThe manor was located on the corner of Waelstar Way and Dragonscale Street in the Swordspoint neighborhood."
