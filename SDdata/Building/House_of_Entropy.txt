The '''House of Entropy''' was a temple dedicated to the worship of [[Entropy]] located within the city of [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]].

==Location==
The temple was located in northern Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples". It sat between [[Myulon's Inn]] and the city's [[Temple of Jergal (Bezantur)|Temple of Jergal]].

==Structure==
The temple had no windows and only a single small door. The entire structure was jet black.

==Activities==
Sermons were delivered by a high priest, and preached against [[wizards]] and the use of [[magic]]. However, the [[Red Wizards]] were either conveniently omitted from these prohibitions or were claimed to be an exception to them.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple's position as an anti-[[mage]] organization made its status in the Red Wizard-controlled city somewhat tentative. The identity of the House's high priest was unknown, and he wore black robes and a dark veil to conceal himself when delivering sermons.
