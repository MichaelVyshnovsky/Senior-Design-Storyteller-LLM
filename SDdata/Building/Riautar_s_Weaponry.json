        "mainbody": "iautars Weaponry was a weapons shop in the city of Waterdeep that was owned by Zarondar Riautar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThis shop was located along the High Road, just east of the Street of the Tusks, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nRiautars Weaponry stood two stories tall. On the roof of the building was a petrified harpy, with wings spread out and body crouched.\nThis shop sold a variety of mundane and magical weapons, being very crowded with stock, most of it secondhand. They were particularly noteworthy for their finely crafted arrows and longbows, which were made on site by the proprietor.\nIn addition to the proprietor Zarondar, Riautars Weaponry employed the fletcher Hragnor Splitstone.\nThe petrified harpy on the buildings roof dated back to the War of Five Wizards, wherein a wizard teleported three harpies into the city from a distant place and soon after another of the five wizards petrified them. Two of the harpies plummeted to the ground, shattering and crushing their summoner, while the third survived and became the statue atop Riataurs Weaponry.\nRiautars Weaponry was among the more notable and recognizable shops in the Trades Ward. It was widely considered to be one of the best sources for arrows, bowstrings, and longbows in Waterdeep, while the shop advertised itself as being one of the best sources in all of the North. Their arrows and longbows were both admired and coveted by any archer who saw them.\nUrban legends claimed that some mage within Waterdeep would occasionally free the harpy from her petrified state, sending her out to kill for him, then force her back into her customary stone state. Over the years no evidence towards this rumor ever surfaced."
