The Mosque of Free Haku was located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This temple could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
The mosque of Haku was open to the wind on the first floor, honoring Hakus preaching of freedom. This mosque did not have a dome, allowing worshipers to sleep on the roof where they could enjoy the nightly breezes. 
High Priest Imam Gholam ibn Jubair was the head of the mosque. He supervised around 200 lesser-ranking priests of Haku and other laymen.
