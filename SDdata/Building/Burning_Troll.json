        "mainbody": "The Burning Troll was an inn in the Lower Port of Skullport.\nThe Burning Troll was a building with three floors. It featured a dance floor and a clean kitchen.\nThe Burning Troll was a popular gathering spot for adventurers, freebooters, and thrill-seekers who flocked to the tavern to share stories, sing bawdy songs, and indulged in lively tavern entertainment. It was renowned for its extensive selection of high-quality spirits, though prices are generally twice as high as those found in the Lands Above. Alcohol offerings were varied, of excellent quality, and nearly limitless, with prices ranging from high to exorbitant.\nThe establishment’s origins lied in an eventful skirmish involving its founders, former adventurers who destroyed a tribe of trolls notorious for ambushing caravans north of Skullport. After driving the trolls into Skullport and dismembering them, the adventurers faced the challenge of preventing the trolls’ regeneration. In a quick-thinking move, they soaked the remains in costly Sembian brandy and set them ablaze.\nOnce the fire was extinguished, the surviving adventurers toasted their victory amid the ashes, christening themselves the \"Trollsinge Vanguard.\" Using the treasure they had amassed in Undermountain, they established a tavern over the site and retired from adventuring. Since then, the Burning Troll has expanded, with a dance floor and a second and third story added, along with a kitchen staff to provide quality meals.\nOf the original Trollsinge Vanguard, only two members remained Ilyana Wyrmmruff and Eulagad the Maul. Ilyanas health was in decline, suggesting that soon only Eulagad will remain to uphold the Vanguard’s legacy.\nThe inn was frequented by Irusyl Eraneth, a prominent information broker, who split her time between the Burning Troll and the Deepfires."
