        "mainbody": "The '''Burning Troll''' was an [[inn]] in the [[Skullport/Lower Port|Lower Port]] of [[Skullport]].",
        "Structure": "The Burning Troll was a building with three floors. It featured a dance floor and a clean kitchen.",
        "Services": "The Burning Troll was a popular gathering spot for adventurers, freebooters, and thrill-seekers who flocked to the tavern to share stories, sing bawdy songs, and indulged in lively tavern entertainment. It was renowned for its extensive selection of high-quality spirits, though prices are generally twice as high as those found in the [[Faerûn|Lands Above]]. Alcohol offerings were varied, of excellent quality, and nearly limitless, with prices ranging from high to exorbitant.",
        "History": "The establishment’s origins lied in an eventful skirmish involving its founders, former adventurers who destroyed a tribe of [[troll]]s notorious for ambushing caravans north of Skullport. After driving the trolls into Skullport and dismembering them, the adventurers faced the challenge of preventing the trolls’ regeneration. In a quick-thinking move, they soaked the remains in costly [[Sembian]] [[brandy]] and set them ablaze.\n\nOnce the fire was extinguished, the surviving adventurers toasted their victory amid the ashes, christening themselves the \"[[Trollsinge Vanguard]].\" Using the treasure they had amassed in [[Undermountain]], they established a tavern over the site and retired from adventuring. Since then, the Burning Troll has expanded, with a dance floor and a second and third story added, along with a kitchen staff to provide quality meals.",
        "Inhabitants": "Of the original Trollsinge Vanguard, only two members remained: [[Ilyana Wyrmmruff]] and [[Eulagad|Eulagad the Maul]]. Ilyana's health was in decline, suggesting that soon only Eulagad will remain to uphold the Vanguard’s legacy.\n\nThe inn was frequented by [[Irusyl Eraneth]], a prominent information broker, who split her time between the Burning Troll and the [[The Deepfires|Deepfires]]."
