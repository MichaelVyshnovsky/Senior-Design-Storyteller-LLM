        "mainbody": "lackiron Blades was a small smithy and weapons shop in Bryn Shander in Icewind Dale. Located a short distance north of the town square, it was known as a one-stop shop for travelers and adventurers.\nThe smith, Garn, made and sold the cheapest blades in the Ten-Towns, rather than trying to make better weapons to compete against the dwarves of Kelvins Cairn. Garns weapons were worth half the typical price. To keep the shop profitable, the manager of the store, Garns sister Elza, marked up all other goods by 50%. She also expanded the shops product line to include various adventuring supplies, such as fur cloaks and snowshoes.\nMany veteran sellswords in Bryn Shander had disdain for Garns lack of skill as a craftsman and joked about the quality of his blades, telling tales of unfortunate travelers that often ended with the words \"…an e was carryin a Blackiron blade, to boot!\""
