        "mainbody": "he Border Outpost was a fortified tower located a days travel north of Arabel on the Moonsea Ride operated by the Purple Dragons.\nThe outpost was of a relatively simple and universal design, and similar fortifications could be found all across Cormyr. It consisted of a squat stone tower adjoined by a sprawling structure that contained a barracks and other utilitarian rooms, as well as a detached stable. The tower had three enclosed floors and an open roof.\nThe outpost was responsible for inspecting travelers entering Cormyr, recording their identities, and ensuring they were aware of the laws of the land. A large sign next to the road ensured that all literate individuals were well informed, while Sergeant Stoan was happy to verbally explain and discuss the matter to ensure there was no confusion.\nVisitors were taken inside to the common room for a brief interview where their identity and business was recorded. Mages of note were examined by the outposts resident War Wizard, who carefully noted down their details. More important visitors were taken to the commanders meeting room, which was more comfortable and finely appointed. Unwanted guests such as unregistered travelers and criminals were kept in the holding cells, which could theoretically hold up to 32 uncomfortable prisoners.\nThe outpost was garrisoned by a squad of ten regular Purple Dragons, led by the veteran Sergeant Stoan. They were assisted by the War Wizard Torvis Mull, and had a dozen light warhorses at the ready in the stable. The armory held about 20 each of longswords, shortbows, daggers, spears, and halberds, along with 400 flight arrows, 200 sheaf arrows, and five suits of chain mail. The doors and trapdoors of the outpost were very sturdy, designed to resist attack.\nThe roof held an iron-framed red crystal globe with continual light cast upon it. It was normally covered by a tarpaulin, and could be uncovered to raise an alert that could been seen for miles and draw reinforcements to the outpost."
