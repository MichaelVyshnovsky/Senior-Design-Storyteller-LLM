'''I Shot an Arrow''' was a tavern in [[Arrowmark]].

==Description==
This rustic tavern was an inexpensive place that was popular with Arrowmark's craftsfolk. It had a quiet and calm atmosphere, the locals quickly ejected any who became too loud or tried to start a brawl. It was not uncommon for a [[bard]] to play a [[harp]] but  the patrons of I Shot an Arrow never sang along or even danced.
