Loudwater Apothecary was a shop in Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale owned by Brosha Manx in the late 15 century DR.
It stood at the southern edge of the town, beside the Loudwater Smithy.
Over the door hung a sign showing a number of strangely shaped bottles to indicate its trade.
Inside, the air was heavy with scents, such as spicy cinnamon, a tangy musk, orange peel, gunpowder, and even baking bread.
At Loudwater Apothecary, Brosha sold the typical herbs, spices, and roots, servicing the cooks and hedge wizards of Loudwater. It also operated as a perfumery, providing a variety of scents.
By 1479 DR, Brosha had recently begun also selling charms and mystical odds-and-ends, such as claws of dragon, powdered horn of unicorn, and burnt-out Ioun stones. Or so their labels and price-tags proclaimedâ€”their actual value and genuineness were dubious. Nevertheless, it they could provided for a few minor rituals and competed with Garwans Curiosities, annoying Garwan.
