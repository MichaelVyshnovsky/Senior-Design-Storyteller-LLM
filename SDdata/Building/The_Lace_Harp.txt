The Lace Harp was an exclusively female drinking and dining social club that catered to women of all races, and later, dominated by crossdressing Nobles of Waterdeep, in the late 14 century DR.
The Lace Harp occupied rentable upper rooms on the third floor above Hammaraks Fine Laces and Adornments, the shop that traded in feminine garments, located in the third building west of Tchozals Race, on Calamastyr Lanes southern side.
The Lace Harp offered its guests quality dining and libations, as well as the company of fellow women.
In the period of time between the 1350s to 1370s DR, The Lace Harps clientele consisted of females â€“ human, elven, half-elven, hin, dwarvish, gnomish, and other races. Lady Dethelle Mantlepard and Nymara "Kitten" Scheiron, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, were active members. By the late 1370s DR, the clientele largely shifted to be pampered noble and wanna-be-noble men of Waterdeep who were into crossdressing.
