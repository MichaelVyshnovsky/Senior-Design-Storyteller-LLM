==Services==
The Lace Harp offered its guests quality dining and libations, as well as the company of fellow women.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Lord Mantlepard's Homecoming

==History==
In the period of time between the [[1350 DR|1350s]] to [[1370 DR|1370s]] [[DR]], The Lace Harp's clientele consisted of females â€“ [[human]], [[elf|elven]], [[half-elven]], [[hin]], [[dwarf|dwarvish]], [[gnome|gnomish]], and other races. Lady [[Dethelle Mantlepard]] and Nymara "Kitten" Scheiron, one of the [[Masked Lords of Waterdeep]], were active members. By the late 1370s DR, the clientele largely shifted to be pampered noble and wanna-be-noble men of Waterdeep who were into crossdressing.
