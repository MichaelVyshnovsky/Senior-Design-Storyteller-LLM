The '''Monument of the Achievements of the Enlightened Throne''' was a tower located within the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
This splendid tower housed halls honoring the [[Grand Caliph]]s of [[Zakhara]]'s past.

==History==
Grand Caliph [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] commissioned this extravagant project to honor his forebears. A special group of [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[ogre]]s, led by a skilled [[architect genie]], were used to build the structure. Artists were used to decorate the walls with historic scenes of the various accomplishments of the Grand Caliphs. Naturally, the current Grand Caliph gave more attention to his father's and grandfather's deeds.

The project was still under construction as of 1367 DR with the hopes that it would be completed for the Grand Caliph's next [[Ascension Day]].
