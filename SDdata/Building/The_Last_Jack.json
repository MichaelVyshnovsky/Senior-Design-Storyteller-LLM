        "mainbody": "'''The Last Jack''' was an inn and a tavern located in [[the Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Last Jack was located just past the [[Ravensbridge]] as one entered the Shutters from [[Shadystreets]], on the crossing of the [[Stonekeep Concourse]] and [[Karen Court]].",
        "Interior": "The Last Jack was known for its taproom and a calm and comfortable atmosphere, especially compared to nearby rowdy [[Salty Dog (Ravens Bluff)|Salty Dog]]. The ground floor taproom was frequented by the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]], making it quite safe. The taproom was always lively but aggressive, loud and rowdy behavior resulted in the problem guests being removed from the inn. Above the taproom, the Last Jack had three floors of guest rooms for those looking rest rather than food and libations. The guest rooms were small and humble, with a single bed with a [[rope]] frame topped with a straw mattress and two [[wool]] [[blanket]]s, a [[candle]]-[[lamp]], a water-[[ewer]] with a [[cup]], and a [[chamberpot]].\n\nThe Last Jack's food and drink was lackluster: watery [[beer]], poor quality [[sausage]]s, stale [[bread]] smothered in [[peppercorn]] [[butter]]. The inn also sold misshapen fried [[saltfish]] of unrecognizable species. However, [[tomato]]-and-[[onion]] [[chutney]] served at the inn was a truly good dish packed with hot-throat [[spice]]s, useful to cover taste of other food here."
