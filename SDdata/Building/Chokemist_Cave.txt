The '''Chokemist Cave''' was home to one of the last colonies of ''[[chokemist]]'' plants in [[Samarach]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

{{quote|Dangerous... but with proper warning, potentially a great draw to the curious. A tale of evil brought to its end, tracked to a corner, and defeated in combat - that ''always'' draws a crowd!|[[Volothamp Geddarm]]}}

==Location==
The cave stood to the north of the [[Snout of Omgar]] in the jungles of Samarach. The entrance into the deadly abyss was an opening in the northern side of a low but rocky mountain. Strange green mist bellowed rhythmically from the cave's entrance.

==Interior==
The cave was filled with toxic clouds of green spores, a type of deadly [[poison]] produced by ''chokemist'' plants. The plants resembled thick, twisting, woody roots with strange blossoming green flowers. The poised poison-filled cave was home to a colony of corrupted [[giant spider]]s, addicted and withered by the swirling spores.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Chokemist Cave was used as a base by a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] infiltrator named [[Luaire Farwander]] who covertly sabotaged merchant operations of one of the merchant companies of [[Samargol]]. Luaire kept the addicted giant spiders as his pets and used ''chokemist'' to poison the [[artificer]] operator of a hidden [[Lantan|Lantanese]] ''[[portal]]''.
