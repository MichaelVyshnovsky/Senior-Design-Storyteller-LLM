An impressively stocked library could also be found here.\nPrices at the Darni House were steep, but a combination of good food, quick services, skilled craftsmen, and fine lodgings kept most patrons coming back on a regular basis.\nJanik Darni was the proprietor of the Darni House. He employed two full platoons of the Diligent to maintain security.\nDue to its upper-class caterings, the Darni House attracted gem and silk merchants, as well as others who carried valuable cargo.\nDarni employed a rawun to entertain guests at night, and a barber to keep them well-groomed."
