The '''Pipe & Unicorn''' was an enormous inn found in the city of [[Myth Drannor]]. It was run by the energetic master brewer, [[Vulph Giftankard]].

==Location==
The inn was located on the [[Street of the Evening Star]], in the district of [[Dlabraddath]] on the eastern side of the city.

==Structure==
Constructed at ground level and extending upward three stories, the Pipe & Unicorn was a massive boarding house. It could provide accommodations for nearly one hundred people, with more than enough drinks from its great brewery located in the cellar.

==Services==
The Pipe & Unicorn brewed a unique [[ale]] that shared the name of the inn itself. The distinct and robust scent of the brew permeated not just the taproom but the rest of the inn as well.
