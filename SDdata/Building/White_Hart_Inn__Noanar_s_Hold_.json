The lodge was popular among wealthy merchants and nobles of the Sword Coast, rising to become one of the most beloved hunting spots in North Faer√ªn. Eventually, a settlement grew around the White Hart Inn.\nGhille Cever was the proprietress of the lodge circa .\nCirca , the inn was ran by Avgar Filroy, a stout, polite, Chondathan man. He commanded a gang of permanently summoned unseen servants who cleaned the establishment. Many thought Avgar to be delusional as he warned his guests about hauntings around Noanars Hold."
