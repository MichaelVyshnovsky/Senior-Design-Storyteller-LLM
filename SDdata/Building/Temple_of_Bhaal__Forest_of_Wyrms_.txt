The '''temple of Bhaal''' in the [[Forest of Wyrms]] was used by [[Bhaalist]]s for some time before being taken over by cultists devoted to [[Cyric]] some time during or before the {{yearlinkName|1368}}.

==Location==
The temple was located deep within a rocky hill within the forest. The underground path leading to its entrance had a number of branching tunnels and caves.

==Interior==
The temple itself featured a large gathering hall, several rooms of living quarters, a laboratory, a small library, and a dedicated ritual room.

==Activities==
{{Quote|Others of Bhaal's orders took me away, to hide us in the darkest temple, away from prying eyes. Others of the Children were there...and when our great Bhaal died did we begin our task.|[[Aliana]], priestess of Bhaal.}}

This temple was one of the locations wherein Bhaalist [[priest]]s kept the [[Bhaalspawn]] children, who were to be used in the ritual that would resurrect the Lord of Murder.

While it was held by [[Cyricist]]s, the temple was used to imprison and torture several of their captives, including [[Madele]], the [[priest]]ess of Bhaal the had blinded, and several members of the [[Shining Crusade]] including the [[dwarf]] [[Keherrem]].

==History==
In either the {{yearlinkName|1347}} or the the [[1348 DR|following year]], a band of [[Harpers]] raided the temple then dedicated to Bhaal and stole away the [[Bhaalspawn|children]] born to the Lord of Murder.{{BG-Alianna}}

When Bhaal died during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, and his portfolio claimed by the mortal Cyric, the former Lord of Murder's clergy continued their worship for some time. Two years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the temple was assailed again, that time by the Cyricist [[Akanna]] and her fellow devotees of the Dark Sun. While many Bhaalists were slain once more, the priestess [[Madele]] was left alive.

The Cyricists laid claim on the Forest of Wyrms temple for nearly a decade, until some time after [[Uktar 1]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, after [[Cyric's Inquisition]] of [[Zhentil Keep]]. Head priestess Akanna became afflicted by terrible dreams and withdrew herself from her fellow acolytes. This persisted for weeks until she began working on some unknown ritual. In truth her mind was being bombarded by the [[illithid]] [[Darskhelin]], who sought to bring forth a [[neothelid]] and prepare the temple to be used as the lair of an [[elder brain]].

==Inhabitants==
The caverns just outside the temple were home to a tribe of [[bugbear]]s and the lair of the [[green dragon]] [[Morentherene]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Hidden within the hall south of the laboratory were six alcoves each decorated with a different mask. Pressing against three of the masks in the correct order opened a hidden treasury.
