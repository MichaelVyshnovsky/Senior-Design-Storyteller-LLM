        "mainbody": "t. Andrals Church was a temple in the village of Vallaki dedicated to the Morninglord, a deity that was merely an alias of the Faer√ªnian solar god Lathander and whose faith was started by the Lathanderite Martyn Pelkar.\nThis temple was slouching in appearance, with a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked stained glass windows that depicted saints. Outside of the temple proper was a garden of gravestones, enclosed within a wrought iron fence. By the 15 century DR, the building appeared to be centuries old.\nBeneath the main altar of the temple was a crypt, holding the bones of its namesake St. Andral, a fact that was known only by the head priest.\nServices were held in the temple at dawn and dusk, wherein the attending priest offered the congregation prayers and reassurance that they were protected by St. Andral.\nFor a small donation of at least 10 gold pieces and the cost of the necessary material component, the high priest would create holy water or cast the spells gentle repose, iron vigil, or purify water.\nIn the 15 century DR this temple was operated by the elderly Father Lucian Petrovich and a couple of young novices, including an orphaned altar boy named Yeska.\nAt some point in the 15 century DR, a coffin-maker living in Vallaki named Henrik van der Voort learned of the location of St. Andrals bones. He paid a desperate young Vallakian named Milivoj to break into it at night. There boy pried open its floor boards with a shovel in order to access its crypt and stole the bones of St. Andral for him in return for food money. Father Lucian was quick to suspect Milivoj of the crime, but was reluctant to confront him due to the boys temper.\nWith the bones in his possession, Henrik planned to pass them along to the vampire spawn living in his attic and keeping him prisoner so they could launch an assault upon the temple, though at some point adventurers interfered in his plans."
