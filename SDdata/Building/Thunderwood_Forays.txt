Thunderwood  Forays was a large shop in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR that specialized in the sale of a wide variety of adventuring gear.
The shop looked unassuming from the outside, like an old, narrow, and tall stone house with dark green trim. Inside, however, the place was one huge room, with catwalks, stairs, and balconies leading to side galleries where the upper floors used to be. The shops wares hung in full view in the open space, a huge assortment of adventuring gear of all sorts.
The shops wares were all warded, set to both alert the Harpers and town guard should someone attempt to steal something and to release the helmed horror guardians placed within the shop by its proprietor, Olbrimsur Thunderwood.
Thunderwood Forays sold all sorts of adventuring gear, but also had a wealth of knowledge about the local area thanks to its proprietors time scouting as a ranger in his free time. Thunderwood would often sponsor adventurers by giving them discounted prices on gear, as well as providing adventuring tips.
