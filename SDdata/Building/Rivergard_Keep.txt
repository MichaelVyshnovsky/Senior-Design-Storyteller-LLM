'''Rivergard Keep''' was a stone fortification on the banks of the [[River Dessarin]], in the [[Sumber Hills]], south of the [[Stone Bridge]] and north of [[Ironford]].

==Structure==
The fortification consisted of a stone keep and gatehouse, with a curtain wall linking it to a river tower and a dock. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was in need of repairs.

==History==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the keep was inhabited by the [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]], and led by [[Jolliver Grimjaw]], who claimed to be restoring the site as "Lord of the Castle" so that he could use it as a means to protect river-based trade.
