Rivergard Keep was a stone fortification on the banks of the River Dessarin, in the Sumber Hills, south of the Stone Bridge and north of Ironford.
The fortification consisted of a stone keep and gatehouse, with a curtain wall linking it to a river tower and a dock. By the late 15 century DR, it was in need of repairs.
Around the , the keep was inhabited by the Cult of the Crushing Wave, and led by Jolliver Grimjaw, who claimed to be restoring the site as "Lord of the Castle" so that he could use it as a means to protect river-based trade.
