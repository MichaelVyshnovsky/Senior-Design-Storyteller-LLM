        "mainbody": "Poisoners Phial was an apothecary shop in the gate-town of Plague-Mort.\nThis shop was located in the Merchants Quarter of Plague-Mort, one of the gate-towns of the Outlands.The 4 edition sourcebook Demonomicon details this shop and the town of Plague-Mort as being within Pazunia, the 1 layer of the Abyss, though as this is not a Realms book and no other Realms-relevant sources acknowledge this, it can be firmly considered non-canon.\nThis shop sold a variety of poisons, venoms, and their affiliated antidotes, as well as acids and medications. Some of these antidotes were mundane, whilst others were magical in nature. Antidotes were sold for twice that of what the shop charged for the toxins they were designed to neutralize.\nAround the mid-to-late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff visited the gate-town of Plague-Mort and while there may have shopped at the Poisoners Phial.\nThis shop was owned and operated by a male tiefling by the name of Laran Susspurus."
