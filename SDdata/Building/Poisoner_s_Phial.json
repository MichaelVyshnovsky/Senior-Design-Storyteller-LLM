        "Location": "This shop was located in the Merchants' Quarter of Plague-Mort, one of the gate-towns of the [[Outlands]].<ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"location\">The 4{{th}} edition sourcebook ''[[Demonomicon]]'' details this shop and the town of Plague-Mort as being within [[Pazunia]], the 1{{st}} layer of the [[Abyss]], though as this is not a Realms book and no other Realms-relevant sources acknowledge this, it can be firmly considered non-canon.",
        "Services": "This shop sold a variety of [[poison]]s, [[venom]]s, and their affiliated [[antidote]]s, as well as [[acid]]s and medications. Some of these antidotes were mundane, whilst others were [[magic]]al in nature. Antidotes were sold for twice that of what the shop charged for the toxins they were designed to neutralize.",
        "History": "Around the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] visited the gate-town of Plague-Mort and while there may have shopped at the Poisoner's Phial.",
        "Inhabitants": "This shop was owned and operated by a male [[tiefling]] by the name of [[Laran Susspurus]]."
