The adventuring and traveling lovers of the arts often trotted to the Holdfast Inn to see the venue's latest acts.\n\nThe eveningfeast was often served from the inn's kitchen, efficiently prepared by Nuli Barbarak. The solid foods were placed on a sizable kitchen table and liquid foods bubbled in kettles and pots.

        "Structure": "The inn was established in the crumbling tower that once belonged to the namesake of Liam's Hold - the mighty warrior and wizard [[Sunder Halyndliam]]. The tower was fully made out of stone, and the floors that survived the ravages of time had ornately carved stone stairs and arched windows. Liam's tower had three wings; each rose two floors up. Two of the wings stood along the hamlet's walls, while the third was connected to the stables, held the inn's entrance, and had the establishment's kitchen and pantries.\n\nThe inn's sign that hung above the main door proudly announced everyone the establishment's name and was decorated with the image of a ''[[crystal ball]]'' adorned with a blue pointy star-spangled wizard's hat.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Holdfast Inn prided itself in mindful service. The servants left warming pans on cold nights and prepared nightkiss drinks for the guests. These drinks were free of charge and left on the nightstands. Warmed towels, robes, and wash water were also provided. The service and filling food were the reasons why many merchants looked forward to their stays at the Holdfast Inn and even arranged their travel plans to get the opportunity for rest and comfort of Liam's Hold."

        "History": "In [[1372 DR]], a famous [[Waterdhavian]] artist [[Evani]] was booked to perform the one and only show alongside her acclaimed musical device [[Evani's Fantabulizer]]. [[Ivus Barbarak]], the innkeep was beyond himself with the joy of being able to convince Evani to perform at the Holdfast Inn.\n\nDuring the same period of time, the village's [[garlic]] enthusiast - [[Rab Bitnez]] was hosting a party bash and placed a huge order for the inn's best [[ale]], something the [[Hero of Daggerford]] help with. Eventually, the simple ale delivery led the hero to uncover a vile [[vampire]] who was feeding on the inhabitants of Liam's Hold under cover of the night."
