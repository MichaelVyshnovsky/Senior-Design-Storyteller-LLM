'''Erro Alhandrar's Nets''' was a small shop that sold fishing [[net]]s imported from [[Sheirtalar]] and the [[Tashalar]], located on [[Saerdoun Street]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Erro Alhandrar's shop shared a three-story-and-an-attic building with a number of other businesses. The building stood on the southern side of Saerdoun Street, three doors west from the intersection with [[Thunderstaff Way]]. Other tenants of the office building were [[Tantra Jaressra's Fine Gowns]], [[Demra Samdro's Best Beds]], [[Laskalan's Lamps and Lanterns]], and [[Vressa's Sweep Begone]], as well as [[Tiger's Eye (shop)|Tiger's Eye]] at one point.

==History==
Erro Alhandrar's Nets was established sometime before the building changed management in the {{YearlinkName|1494}}, now in the hands of the [[gnome]] named [[Hardyn Glorjarn]], who took over the building's attic.
