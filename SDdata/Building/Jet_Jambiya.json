        "mainbody": "The '''Jet Jambiya''' was a popular tavern and meeting place in [[Calimport]], [[Calimshan]], around the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]].",
        "Location": "The tavern could be found in the southern part of the [[Taorahl Drudach|Taorahl]] drudach (neighborhood), which in turn was located in the [[Eraré Sabban|Eraré]] sabban (district) of Calimport's [[Hook Ward]].",
        "Structure": "The Jet Jambiya was a two-story building in the shape of a G, giving space to an open-air, central courtyard that served as the tavern's main taproom. Two internal taprooms were also available, in the case of inclement weather.",
        "Services": "The tavern derived its name from a magical, black [[jambiya]] that hovered 40 feet in the air above the fountain in the middle of the courtyard. Any weapons drawn were immediately absorbed by the jambiya, barring the clubs carried by the tavern staff. Over time, the jambiya swallowed several famous weapons, such as the ''[[Beljureled Blade of Nazir Rabir]]'', ''[[Samark the Staff of Screams]]'', the ''[[Four Daggers of Delvenahr]]'', and ''[[Giisan the White Sash of Sorcerers]]''. Furthermore, it was rumored that the jambiya was actually an intelligent ''[[portable hole]]''. Whatever the case, this feature made the Jet Jambiya a popular meeting ground, serving as a safe and neutral territory for all.\n\nPrices at the Jet Jambiya were fairly expensive, but cheaper drinks could be surreptitiously obtained by befriending or bribing the staff.",
        "Inhabitants": "The armorer [[Kahim el Tunril]] frequented the Jet Jambiya, and was known for his prowess in arm-wrestling matches."
