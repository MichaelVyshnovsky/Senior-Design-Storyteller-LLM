        "mainbody": "ood was one of the five elemental building blocks of matter, according to the sages of Kara-Tur. It was fundamentally tied to nature. The House of Nature, one of the planes in the World Tree cosmology, was said to contain animals composed of the element wood.\nIn the magical traditions of the east, wood was one of the five elements over which wu jen could obtain mastery. For example, the elemental aura spell, when cast by a wu jen, could protect against attacks from wooden weapons or from living plants."
