'''Olmhazan's Jewels''' was a jewelry shop in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
The shop was located on the west side of the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]], across from the the entrance to [[Spendthrift Alley]].

==Structure==
The shop's façade was made of [[silver]]ed polished stone and was shaped like an enormous faceted [[gemstone]]. This aesthetic choice was commonly mocked by the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]].

==Interior==
The inside of the shop was lined with displays showing an enormous variety of nonmagical gemstones. The display stands were decorated with [[beljuril]] shards that made them continuously sparkle.

==Services==
Almost all varieries of gems could be found for sale at Olmhazan's Jewels, save for [[magic]]al gems and extremely rare ones, such as [[amaratha]], [[king's tears]], and [[rogue stone]]s. Prices were slightly higher than typical market values, usually adding between 15 and 25 [[gp]] to each stone's value.

==Defenses==
The shop was defended by two trained [[mimic]]s that disguised themselves as a display stand and part of the front entrance and gem façade. It was uncommon for thieves to steal from the shop since one such attempt had resulted in the thief being partially devoured by one of the mimics.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], the shop was owned and operated by [[Jhauntar Olmhazan]], who also held the position of Gentleman Speaker at Waterdeep's [[Jewelers' Guild]]. Jhauntar was dismissive of all country folk and regarded the inhabitants of the eastern shore of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] as barbarians.
