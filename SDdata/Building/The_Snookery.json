        "mainbody": "The Snookery was a rather old building in the city of Waterdeep,\nThis home was located along Spindle Street, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep since before 1357 DR.\nThe Snookery stood two stories tall. Its walls were made of stone and its windows were barred. Its exterior doors were covered in the plating of old armor, hammered flat. Atop the roof of the building were its eponymous \"snooks\"&mdashintelligent, animated stone statues similar in nature to a gargoyle, but carved to resemble a griffon&mdashwho acted as the buildings guardians, circa 1372 DR. The \"snooks\" were unshakably loyal to Myrmith and even magic could not turn them against him.\nInside of the building was equipment for modifying or repairing weapons, which often gave it a muted din similar to the sounds of a foundry. The home also had on public display a large variety of weaponry of all sorts, collected by Myrmith, for daily use.\nBeyond being his place of residence, Myrmith Splendon used the Snookery as a space to instruct and train his clients in the ways of fighting with weaponry of all sorts. The intensive training would ensure a certain level of weapon expertise improvement. He charged an advanced, steep fee for these services. The fee was 190 gold pieces per week, multiplied by the clients level of expertise. If a client wanted to \"bump\" themselves up the wait list, he or she had to pay double the asking fee.\nBesides the buildings \"snooks\", which were constantly being experimented and improved upon by Myrmiths wizard friends, the Snookery was protected against robbers by seven magical +2 flying daggers. These daggers could not be affected by any type of magical or psionic control except by Myrmith, and they were immune to magic missile and all lightning or electrical-based magic, which they would reflect back at the caster with full force."
