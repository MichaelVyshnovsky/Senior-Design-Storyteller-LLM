Pearl Citadel was the headquarters of the military forces of Sambral, one of the Windrise Ports of Laerakond.
The Pearl Citadel was a titanic construction. Its most striking feature was the soaring Nacre Tower, built at the tip of the promontory and facing out over the sea. It was made out of mother-of-pearl, gleaming in iridescent beauty, especially at sunset.
The keep served as the headquarters of the Sentinels, the military forces of Sambral.
The keep was built millennia ago by the Dawn Titans, and was infused with their power to resist even the fiercest dragon attack.
