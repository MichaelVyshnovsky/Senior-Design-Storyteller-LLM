The Moonstone Manse was a 14-century school of the arcane arts that was located in the Impilturan city of Hlammach. It was seen as the lesser of the two magic academies of the realm, inferior to the well-renowned Towers of the Wind located in nearby Lyrabar.
Founded in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR by Plathyon Hawkryn, the school educated a few select pupils on the magical relationship between the Weave and the naturally-occurring gems and other precious stones of Toril. Their lessons specifically focused on moonstones, the feldspar from which the school drew its name.
Some believed that the schools founding was merely an action taken by the noble Hawkryn to further increase their wealth, as they owned a number of abundant moonstone mines within the Earthfast Mountains.
