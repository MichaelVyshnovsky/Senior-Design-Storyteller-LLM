        "mainbody": "Astral Plane\nThe Living Gate was a portal that connected the multiverse with the Far Realm.\nThe Living Gate was a tiny portal so small that its diameter was measured in eyelashes.\nThe Living Gate was originally located in the Astral Plane during the ancient times before the Dawn War. However, after its destruction, fragments of the gate scattered across the multiverse. In the late 15 century DR, the gate was located in the Feydark, beneath the ruined city of Cendriane.\nEven when usually the Living Gate connected the multiverse with the Far Realm, \nIn the time before the Dawn War, the Living Gate was hidden in the depths of the Astral Plane, being watched over by a being that was neither a god or a primordial, but kin to both. The Oerthian deities Pelor and Tharizdun, as well as the Nerathian deity Ioun, discovered the gate and peered through it, learning terrible secrets that changed them forever. They left the gate alone, promising never to return.\nHowever, while the Dawn War was raging, Tharizdun returned, killed its guardian and opened the gate, releasing corruptive energy from the Far Realm into the multiverse, which in turn led to the formation of psionic power. Some time later, Pelor and Ioun managed to seal the barrier once again by destroying the Living Gate.\nAt some point in the ancient past of the Feywild, the Living Gate appeared in that plane but was sealed, and the seal was protected by eladrin knights appointed by Queen Titania for the task. \nAt some point in the past, a group of worshipers of Tharizdun managed to retrieve a shard of the Living Gate in the world of Nerath, and took it to Pandemonium, in an attempt to release their dark god from his ancient prison. They transformed the fragment into a Vast Gate, but the ritual was interrupted by a group of Nerathian heroes, among them the deva Demascus, who managed to destroy the Vast Gate, but not before they could unleash the Abyssal plague throught the multiverse.\nSome time after the Spellplague, Soveliss, nephew of Queen Titania and leader of the eladrin wardens of the Living Gate in the Feywild, destroyed the seal for unknown reasons, releasing the horrors of the Far Realm into the world. The half-orc druid Haggar and his wife, the shiere knight eladrin Astriana, were able to re-seal the gate, but most of the guards of the Living Gate were destroyed in the attempt.\nIn the late years of the 15 century DR, a fragment of the Living Gate has held by Zaltys Serrat in the form of an arrowhead. Zaltys believed the artifact to be a weapon against aberrations. The arrowhead was eventually used by Iraska to open a portal to the Far Realm in the Underdark, but Iraska, the portal and the fragment were destroyed by the sacrifice of Zaltys bodyguard, Krailash."
