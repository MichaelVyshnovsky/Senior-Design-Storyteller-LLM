}}'''The Sly Fox''' was an inn located in [[Zelbross]].

==Services==
It provided good services such as soft beds, hot [[turnip]] pie, and a hearth, as well as stores.

==Description==
The inn was rather popular, as Zelbross had a good view of the [[Southwood]] across the river, and had a sign carved in the shape of a [[fox]]'s head.

==History==
It was later destroyed, either pillaged by [[goblin]]s or burned down by brigands, the sources are not particularly clear. Later, a boy known as [[Orok]] used the ruin of the inn as a hideout.
