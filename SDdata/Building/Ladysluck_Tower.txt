The '''Ladysluck Tower''' was a house of worship for [[Tymora]] in [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
High Luck Priestess [[Jhyndara Thiolstar]] and her 34 fellow priests and priestesses of Tymora ran the temple in [[1358 DR]]. Together they attended a congregation of 71 followers.

By [[1373 DR]], the High Luck was [[Colle Shoondeep]]. The temple had benefited from several very favorable leases granted by Lady [[Monstaed]]'s deceased husband, which [[Variance Amatick]] transferred to [[Moonshadow Hall]] in the guise of Lady Monstaed.
