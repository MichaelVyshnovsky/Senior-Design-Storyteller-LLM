The House of Light was the guildhall of a Waterdhavian guild known as the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters.
The House of Light was located along Scroll Street, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep. Behind the guildhall stood a warehouse used by the guild.
This guildhall was three-stories tall. The building was a row house that was near constantly bright. Out front of it stood a  tall candle that would be lit at night &mdash this was one of the brightest spots in the Trades Ward at such hours and it was easily found by the lemon scent its wax gave off.
During the day, members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters crafted candles, mostly from tallow, that they would sell. They also worked on repairing lamps during daylight hours.
The House of Light was among some of the more notable and recognizable guildhalls in the Trades Ward.
