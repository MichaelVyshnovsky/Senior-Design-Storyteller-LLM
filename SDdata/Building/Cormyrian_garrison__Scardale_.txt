The '''Cormyrian garrison''' was a fortification in [[Scardale Town]] established by the nation of [[Cormyr]] to represent their interests in the area following the [[second inter-dale war]] in [[1356 DR]].

The garrison was maintained by the Forest Kingdin during the occupation of [[Scardale]] by the coalition forces of Cormyr, [[Hillsfar]], [[Sembia]], [[Zhentil Keep]], and the other nations of the [[Dalelands]]. The forces of Cormyr were tired of the standoff with other nations, but hesitant to let the Zhents get the upper hand. However, they had left the city by the time the [[Shaking Plague]] ravaged the city in [[1370 DR]].

During the occupation, it was led by the seasoned warrior and diplomat [[Truent Tyranon]].
