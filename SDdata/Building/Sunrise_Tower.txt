The Sunrise Tower, also colloquially known as The Mad Tower, was an asylum in the North Ward of Waterdeep for those of addled and sick mind that was operational in the 15 century DR.
The Sunrise Tower stood on the northwestern side of the Trollmarch and Black Dog Alley crossing.
Under the rulership of the Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, all admissions and releases were to be personally approved by the Open Lord. The asylum was guarded by a dozen veteran officers of the City Watch at all times, often referred to as "Trusties". The hospital staff lived in the tower quarters.
The tower that housed the asylum was the site of the Black Dog Tavern in the 1350s DR and later the home of wizard Thalandruil.
From 1460s DR onward, it was used as an asylum.
