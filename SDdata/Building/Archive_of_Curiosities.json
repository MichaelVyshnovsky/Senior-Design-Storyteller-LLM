        "mainbody": "The Archive of Curiosities was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nUnique gifts presented to the Grand Caliph and other treasures were displayed here for the public to see. Some of the more interesting items included a pirate flag taken by the Grand Caliph himself during his adventuring days, a jade throne presented by the emperor of Shou Lung, a magical harp that played music on command, and a large tapestry depicting a king with a purple dragon on his shield.\nThe Grand Caliph desperately wanted to add a genuine Halruaan skyship to his collection, and was willing to pay handsomely for the acquisition."
