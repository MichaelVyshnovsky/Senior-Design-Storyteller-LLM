The '''Wildlands Rest''' was a wayside inn in the frontier land of the [[Silver Marches]]. It was a safe and secure place for travelers to rest for the night.

==Location==
The Wildlands Rest was located in the region of [[Delzoun|Old Delzoun]] at [[the Fork]], the place where the [[Adbar Road]] from [[Citadel Adbar]] and the [[Fork Road]] from [[Sundabar]] met.

==Structure==
The building was built of stone and looked more like a blockhouse than an inn. Over time, its owners constantly expanded its size.

==History==
The Wildlands Rest was founded in [[1371 DR]] by [[Grumbelham Goldhand]], a male [[dwarf]] and [[Irvag|Irvag the Bear]], a male [[human]]. The entrepreneurial partners were retired adventurers.

[[Orc]] bands in the area tried to attack the inn on more than one occasion, but the old adventurers drove them away.

==Rumors & Legends==
The inn was located near [[Ghaurin's Hold]], an old dwarven ruin rumored to contain lost treasures.
