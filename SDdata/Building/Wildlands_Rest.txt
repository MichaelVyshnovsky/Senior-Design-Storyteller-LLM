The Wildlands Rest was a wayside inn in the frontier land of the Silver Marches. It was a safe and secure place for travelers to rest for the night.
The Wildlands Rest was located in the region of Old Delzoun at the Fork, the place where the Adbar Road from Citadel Adbar and the Fork Road from Sundabar met.
The building was built of stone and looked more like a blockhouse than an inn. Over time, its owners constantly expanded its size.
The Wildlands Rest was founded in 1371 DR by Grumbelham Goldhand, a male dwarf and Irvag the Bear, a male human. The entrepreneurial partners were retired adventurers.
Orc bands in the area tried to attack the inn on more than one occasion, but the old adventurers drove them away.
The inn was located near Ghaurins Hold, an old dwarven ruin rumored to contain lost treasures.
