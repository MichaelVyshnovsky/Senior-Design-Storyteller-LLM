The Shrine of the Spring was a shrine found in Miyama Province in Kozakura during the mid–14 century, by the Dalereckoning calendar of Faerûn.
The shrine was built over an underground spring that was said to house a nature spirit.
It comprised a simple building surrounded by beauteous rock garden, all encased within a wall for protection. The compound included one additional building, the home of the sea spirit folk Nado Tori.
The shrine was protected by a half score of sohei, led by a single commander.
The water nature spirit that dwelled within the shrines underground spring possessed a strong romantic attraction to Nado. She often manifested herself in form of a graceful and elegant woman.
