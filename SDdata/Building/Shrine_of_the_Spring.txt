The '''Shrine of the Spring''' was a shrine found in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] during the mid–14{{th}} century, by the [[Dalereckoning]] calendar of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
The shrine was built over an underground spring that was said to house a [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]].

==Structure==
It comprised a simple building surrounded by beauteous rock garden, all encased within a wall for protection. The compound included one additional building, the home of the [[sea spirit folk]] [[Nado Tori]].

==Defenses==
The shrine was protected by a half score of [[sohei]], led by a single commander.

==Inhabitants==
The water nature spirit that dwelled within the shrine's underground spring possessed a strong romantic attraction to Nado. She often manifested herself in form of a graceful and elegant woman.
