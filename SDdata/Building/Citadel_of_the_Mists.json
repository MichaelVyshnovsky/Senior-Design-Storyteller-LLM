        "mainbody": "The '''Citadel of the Mists''' was a castle located in the north-east area of the [[High Forest]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}}",
        "Location": "The Citadel of the Mists was located in a secluded part of the northern edge of the High Forest. It was built on top of an ancient elven armory, which was connected to the [[Trail of Mists]].",
        "Structure": "The Citadel comprised two buildings that enclosed a narrow triangular courtyard. Its most striking feature was a set of three towers of different heights. Invisible ''[[dimension door]]'' portals were dotted throughout the Citadel and could transport unsuspecting visitors to other parts of the structure.",
        "Defenses": "The Citadel was cloaked by an ancient ''[[wardmist]]'' [[spell]] that made it almost inaccessible. The Mistmaster had modified this spell to be triggered automatically when specific conditions were present, similar to a ''[[magic mouth]]'' spell. He also could use his powers to cloak the entire citadel at will. The Mistmaster had given a [[ward token]] to each of his allies, which stopped the ''wardmist'' from triggering on them. As well as mists, the Citadel was protected by [[illusion]] magic. The armory below the Citadel was protected by warding spells.\n\nThe Citadel's tallest tower was protected by [[fire elemental]]s and [[air elemental]]s that had been magically charmed.",
        "History": "The elven fortress on the ruins of which the Citadel would be built was constructed around {{Yearlink|-4500}} by [[cambion]]s from [[House Dlardrageth]] to serve as an armory of [[magic]] items from [[Aryvandaar]]. Bound [[demon]]s were also used to guard the treasure. It was discovered and plundered by [[Siluvanede]]nn forces, and abandoned around {{Yearlink|-4300}}. [[Eaerlann]] discovered it again after their annexation of Siluvanede, and sent [[archmages]] to create magical wards in order to protectively seal away the armory.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-3150}}, Eaerlanni elves chose upper chambers of the armory as a way station for [[gnome]]s fleeing [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[slavery]] through the recently created Trail of Mists. The gnomish use of the armory continued to around {{Yearlink|-1700}}, when demons escaped their binding spells and seized the upper chambers. A group of [[adventurer]]s comprising [[forest gnome]]s and [[moon elves]] protected the armory with additional wards to prevent the demons from escaping the armory altogether.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1294}}, the Mistmaster had the Citadel built on top of the warded ruins of the elven armory. In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Mistmaster allied his forces with [[Turlang]] and a force of [[fey]] to protect the Citadel from an attacking alliance of demons and the [[Blue Bear tribe]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were many rumors about treasure in the vaults beneath the citadel, left over from its original purpose as a storehouse of magic items for House Dlardrageth.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the lord of the Citadel was the [[Mistmaster]], a mysterious and powerful [[illusionist]] and [[cleric]] of [[Leira]]. His consort was a [[halfling]] [[evoker]] named [[Azure]]. [[Iltmul]] the [[monk]] also resided there The Mistmaster allowed [[Cherissa Mintareil]] and other powerful adventurers to stay there. He also employed a small group of staff for the Citadel.\n\nThe Citadel was also home to [[pegasi]], which were trained at the whims of the Mistmaster. It was protected by charmed fire elementals and air elementals."
