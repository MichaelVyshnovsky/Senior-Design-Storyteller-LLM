'''Harrow Hill''' was a haunted mansion in [[Shadowdale]].

==Location==
Harrow Hill lay within the [[Dagger Hills]] of [[Shadowdale]], not far from a road.

==Structure==
To adventurers out of Freedale, the house looked like it had been transported out of another place and time, being completely unlike local stone or wooden construction.

==Interior==
The house had a front parlor music room, dining hall, kitchen, a "sun room" or [[underglass|conservatory]], storeroom, cellar, and at least two bedrooms, not counting the servants' quarters.

There was also a secret crypt.

==Defenses==
The ghost of the owner, [[Gunter Weiss]], could cause the house to seal itself against all escape. There were also hostile undead monsters throughout.

==History==
The house had belonged to Gunter Weiss, a powerful wizard. At some point he came to be obsessed with a young woman, [[Erika]], and convinced himself if he had his youth again, she'd return his feelings. Turning to necromancy, he sought a way to achieve eternal life.

Around {{yearlink|1270}},Assuming an approximate date between 1367 and 1372 DR, the default dates for 2e and 3e respectively, and that Gunter claims the ritual was to be completed "a hundred years ago" gives the approximate date of 1270 for his deadly rite. he finally undertook the rite he'd planned; Erika, however, stole the silver heart that was the centerpiece of the ritual, causing Gunter's death. She later died, unable to escape the house. His ghost lingered on, however, waiting for the living to intrude upon his abode so he could steal their bodies.

Around {{yearlink|1370}}, the traveling cleric [[Klaus (Dalelands)|Klaus]] and his companions stopped at the house, and the ghost of Gunter Weiss trapped them, demanding they surrender one of their own for him to take their lives. They surrendered Klaus, who hid himself within the master bedroom, lighting an [[enchanted]] candle to protect himself against Gunter's undead. His companions were punished by divine intervention, becoming lost souls that haunted the roads nearby. About six nights later, adventurers may have arrived.

==Inhabitants==
The mansion was haunted by the [[ghost]] of its creator, Gunter Weiss, as well as that of his unrequited love, [[Erika]]. It was additionally occupied by Gunter's [[undead]] servants ([[ghoul]]s, [[shadow]]s, and [[zombie]]s) and vermin, including [[constrictor snake]]s, [[giant rat]]s, and [[giant spider]]s.
