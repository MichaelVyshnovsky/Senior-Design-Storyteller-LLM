Carpathians Tavern was one of the taverns in Menzoberranzan in the midâ€“14 century DR. It sold food and beverages.
Adventurers could find Rizzen DoUrden here. Rizzen offered to make them a map of House DoUrden, including where the prisoners of their village were being kept, in exchange for the Helm of Spiders. He explained that the helmet had three parts the base, the crest, and the gem. With it, a drow house could gain a large advantage over others. He later sent them to meet with Jarlaxle, to acquire an insignia of House DoUrden, without which the house glyphs would destroy them upon entry.
