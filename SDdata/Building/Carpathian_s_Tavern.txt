'''Carpathian's Tavern''' was one of the taverns in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It sold food and beverages.

[[Adventurer]]s could find [[Rizzen Do'Urden]] here. Rizzen offered to make them a map of [[House Do'Urden]], including where the prisoners of their village were being kept, in exchange for the ''[[Helm of Spiders]]''. He explained that the helmet had three parts: the base, the crest, and the gem. With it, a drow house could gain a large advantage over others. He later sent them to meet with [[Jarlaxle Baenre|Jarlaxle]], to acquire an insignia of House Do'Urden, without which the house [[House defense glyph|glyph]]s would destroy them upon entry.
