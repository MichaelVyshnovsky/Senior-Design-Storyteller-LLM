'''Mother Tara's Festhall''' was a banquet hall in the town of [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]]. 

==Geography==
Located on the western side of the [[Shadowdale Trail]], Mother Tara's Festhall was situated between [[Mane's Manor]] and [[Hammerhand Bucko]]'s house. 

==Services==
The two-story dwelling specialized in fine [[wine]]s, good food, gaming, and sundry other "divertissements" for the traveler or the merchant. Prices were ten gold for an evening, which included a sumptuous banquet, dancing, singing, and the opportunity spend additional money at the gaming tables, or the hired help. While the [[Zhent]] occupation, the festhall became a dirty brothel and most of the frequent occupants were mid-level officers, who spent their time and money gambling.

==Staff==
The festhall was owned and operated by the [[halfling]], [[Mother Tara]], who kept a honest establishment and was proud of her reputation. She was backed up by [[Briig]], who was said to be a [[flesh golem]] with an illusion spell placed upon him, which was a lie, but one that Mother Tara used to her advantage. Most of the gold earned from customers was repaid to the [[Zhentarim]] in the form of heavy taxes.

==History==
In [[1359 DR]], one of Mother Tara's girls turned out to be a [[weretiger]] and was slain by one of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], [[Florin Falconhand]]. 

During [[1374 DR]], the [[Zhentilar]] took over the vale of [[Shadowdale]] and utilized all the surrounding area, including the festhall.

==Prices==
*Banquet hall could be rented for 10 gp per night.
