Mother Taras Festhall was a banquet hall in the town of Shadowdale. 
Located on the western side of the Shadowdale Trail, Mother Taras Festhall was situated between Manes Manor and Hammerhand Buckos house. 
The two-story dwelling specialized in fine wines, good food, gaming, and sundry other "divertissements" for the traveler or the merchant. Prices were ten gold for an evening, which included a sumptuous banquet, dancing, singing, and the opportunity spend additional money at the gaming tables, or the hired help. While the Zhent occupation, the festhall became a dirty brothel and most of the frequent occupants were mid-level officers, who spent their time and money gambling.
The festhall was owned and operated by the halfling, Mother Tara, who kept a honest establishment and was proud of her reputation. She was backed up by Briig, who was said to be a flesh golem with an illusion spell placed upon him, which was a lie, but one that Mother Tara used to her advantage. Most of the gold earned from customers was repaid to the Zhentarim in the form of heavy taxes.
In 1359 DR, one of Mother Taras girls turned out to be a weretiger and was slain by one of the Knights of Myth Drannor, Florin Falconhand. 
During 1374 DR, the Zhentilar took over the vale of Shadowdale and utilized all the surrounding area, including the festhall.
*Banquet hall could be rented for 10 gp per night.
