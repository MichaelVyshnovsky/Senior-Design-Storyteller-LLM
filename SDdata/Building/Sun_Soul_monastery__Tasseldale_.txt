The Sun Soul monastery of Tasseldale was one of the few active priories of the Order of the Sun Soul monks during the late 14 century DR. It was located in a re-purposed ruined freehold within the Dun Hills. The monks of this order, along with followers of Tyr from the Abbey of the Just Hammer, contributed greatly to the pacification of monsters, particularly goblins, in the region.
While the monks of this monastery freely opened their doors to prospective students of all nations and races, they were particularly uncompromising on those who hailed from Sembia.
