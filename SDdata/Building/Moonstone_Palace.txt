The Moonstone Palace (also known as Moonflower Palace) was the home of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower in the city of Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet.
It was a huge white structure made from marble, alabaster and crystal, surrounded by the guardian trees, and situated above the city of Leuthilspar. Its featured slender towers, flying buttresses and sky bridges.
The throne room was a high and vaulted round chamber ringed with galleries and with a huge glass dome at its top. The dome was made of theurglass and was composed of a mosaic of stained panels, which turned clear by night in order to give a view of the stars. The room had a dark marble floor. The throne itself was gilded and hovered  from the floor.
The grounds of the palace were very large, and contained hedge mazes, gardens, parks, and lakes.
The rooms of the palace were expansive and offered very good views of Leuthilspar and the ocean and forest.
Apart from Queen Amlaruil herself, the Council of Matrons frequented the palace, in addition to Amlaruils top mages, who had their own towers. There were several lesser palaces in which Amlaruils family lived.
