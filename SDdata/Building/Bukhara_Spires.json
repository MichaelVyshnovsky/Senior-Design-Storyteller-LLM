        "mainbody": "The '''Bukhara Spires''' were circles of massive [[bronze]] spires erected by the [[Imaskari]] of [[Imaskar]] during their Early Dynastic period ([[-7975 DR|&minus;7975]] to {{Yearlink|-6422}}), at a time when they had mastered [[transdimensional]] magic.\n\nEach was etched with an intricate runic design said to be [[batrachi]] in origin. These permanent, two-way [[portals]] allowed the rapid transportation of whole legions over vast distances in the blink of an eye. This allowed the Imaskar Empire to rapidly expand across [[East Faerûn|eastern Faerûn]]. After the [[Silent Death]] (which started in {{Yearlink|-4370}}) nearly destroyed Lower Imaskar, Lord Artificer [[Khotan]] created twin Spires that connected to another world where the people had no control over the arcane arts. Over the next four centuries, tens of thousands of slaves where taken from the other world. Eventually this slave population began to intermarry with the Imaskari, giving rise to the [[Mulan]] ethnicity."
