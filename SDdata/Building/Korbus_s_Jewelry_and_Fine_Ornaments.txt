Korbuss Jewelry and Fine Ornaments was a rather small jewelry shop located in the town of Daggerford. It was owned and operated by the dukes court jeweler, Korbus Brightjewel.
It was located on the southern side of Daggerfords Money Quarter at the junction of the Trade Way, High Road, and Water Street.
While the shop itself was only one story, there were gnomish living quarters within its basement.
Korbus crafted all manner of ornamental jewelry, from the usual earrings and bracelets to even bejeweled belts and bracers. While it was believed beauty of these pieces were enhanced by means of his magical abilities,
His custom pieces were in high demand among the wealthy Waterdhavian merchants,
Additionally, Korbus offered services of identification and appraisal for the small fee of 10 gp per piece examined.
