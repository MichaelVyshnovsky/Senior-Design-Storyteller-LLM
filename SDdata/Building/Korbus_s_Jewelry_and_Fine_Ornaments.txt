==Structure==
While the shop itself was only one story, there were [[gnome|gnomish]] living quarters within its basement.

==Services==
Korbus crafted all manner of ornamental jewelry, from the usual [[earring]]s and [[bracelet]]s to even bejeweled [[belt]]s and [[bracer]]s. While it was believed beauty of these pieces were enhanced by means of his [[magic]]al abilities,

His custom pieces were in high demand among the wealthy [[Waterdhavian]] merchants,

Additionally, Korbus offered services of identification and appraisal for the small fee of 10 [[gp]] per piece examined.
