        "History": "While the school was open, all individuals who reached the rank of the Master were gifted special [[enchanted]] ''[[Golden Bamboo Staff|Golden Bamboo Staves]]''. The school's end came in the early-to-mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], then the Masters of the Golden Fox came into a conflict with the notorious [[Yakuza]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Yakuza emerged victorious in the conflict, and to ensure the Golden Fox Martial Arts School would never be reestablished, they hunted down and destroyed the ''Golden Bamboo Staves''. Even though there were seven in existence, at least one of the weapons was saved and taken out of Wa."
