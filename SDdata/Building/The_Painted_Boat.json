        "mainbody": "'''The Painted Boat''' was one of the more unique eateries and event spaces, a floating structure that once was anchored {{SI|300'|'\"|long=yes}} off of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s harbor and jurisdiction in the waters of the [[Fire River]], later, relocated to the shores of the [[Ladyrock]] neighborhood by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",

The restaurant stood on stilts over the waters of the Fire River, affixed to a submerged [[sand]]y shoal. It consisted of two floors and an attic in the building's peaked roof, shingled with salvaged red, brown, and dark yellow [[clay (ceramic)|clay]] [[tile]]s. Both floors had windows that were usually kept open, apart from when it stormed.\n\nThe first floor stood on a {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} elevation over the water level, staying protected from storm waves, looming over a landing dock, which was connected to the kitchen via a dumbwaiter big enough to haul up [[barrel]]s of drink and produce.{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|16}}\n\nOutside, one could find a single swift mainland [[sloop]] called ''[[The Flying Fish]]'' tied to the docks.

        "History": "Brothers Ticaht and Nimtu opened the Boat as a way of turning a profit by doing legal work while doing it on their own terms. However, it never stopped the brothers from allowing certain unsavory activities to take place in their restaurant late at night. Industrious by nature and nurture, Ticaht and Nimtu were \"wreckers\"–salvagers of shipwrecks and flotsam, evident by the restaurant being built and decorated from just that. Some of the wrecks were caused by the brothers through luring unwitting vessels to their rocky doom via signal fires built exclusively along the dangerous shores of the [[Wild Coast (Vast)|Wild Coast]] at night, about the half-a-day journey to Ravens Bluff.\n\nThe restaurant was perched in the middle of the river for at least two hours,",
        "Inhabitants": "When the entertainment was not provided, or when the business was closed, the dance deck was occupied by fishers and loud [[seagull]]s, as well as a pair of large dock [[cat]]s–[[Venus]] and [[Adonis]], that belonged to the owners and were used as security. Once a year, the Boat's owners sold the cats' litter for a high coin."
