        "mainbody": "The Hold of Battle Lions, or Hold of the Battle Lions, was a shrine to Tempus built within in Dragonspear Castle. It remained a bastion against the fiends of the Nine Hells for over 150 years, despite the repeated leveling of its structure.\nThe stone temple was located within the castles inner ward, a short distance beyond the front doors of the main keep.Volos Guide to the Sword Coast states the temple was located within the castles cellars.\nAltar of Tempus\nBoth in the years while it was intact and the century or so afterwards, the Hold of Battle Lions safeguarded the altar dedicated to Tempus. This stained marble altar was the focal point for rituals that revitalized and strengthened the wards sealing the portal that lay beneath Dragonspear Castle.\nSet within the marble was the source of its tremendous power,\nThe temple served as a bulwark to the fiends that could readily escape from the Nine Hells through the portal beneath Dragonspear Castle. The champions of the temple carried out their duty for nearly half a century, before being overwhelmed. \nWhile it was intact and occupied, the temple was considered to be well-manned and fortified.\nThe Hold of Battle Lions was built in the , after the combined forces of  Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep eradicated the malevolent forces that lived within the castle. \nIn the , just after the First Dragonspear War, the castle was overrun by devils once more. They were rebuffed and cleared out some seven years later, and the temple was rebuilt as a shrine by Tempus priests.The FRCS 3e states that priests of Tempus erected  shrine \"a decade ago\" from 1372 DR. Presumably they are referring to a rebuilt Hold of Battle Lions, rather than its original construction some 50 years prior or some secondary shrine of Tempus.\nFor many years the shrine was regularly assaulted by various beastly and malicious creatures, such as bugbears, orcs, drow, and fiends, but remained intact for some time.\nAs of the 15 century DR, the castle came under the protection of a group of mercenaries. Some time before the , the mercenaries were bested and the temple was once again destroyed, this by undead forces under the leadership of the creature known as Born.\nSome years later, Alwern Mulverax and Darrondar Gweth visited the ruined shrine in order to cast the necessary rituals that would strengthen the wards sealing Dragonspears portal. Alwern betrayed his friend and left him to be dominated by the Szarlnaxi vampires that had taken nearby residence.\nAround that same time, the rakshasa Nadir sought out the temple to break the portals seals. He believed this could be accomplished by defiling the altar with the blood of a devout follower of Tempus, namely Darrondar."
