The '''Temple of Kossuth''' in [[Proskur]] was located within the city's [[Thay]]an [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]], having been established by the [[Red Wizards]] to pay service to the [[Kossuth|Lord of Flames]]. It offered the deity token worship from his faithful among the transplants from Thay, and the somewhat meager following found in the city and greater [[Dragon Coast]].

==Staff==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the temple was led by the High Priest, [[So-Kehur (Proskur)|So-Kehur]], who sought to expand the worship of Kossuth throughout the region surrounding the [[Inner Sea]]. He was a master of religious politics, who strongly supported [[khazark]] [[Chathin Zurn]] so long as they offered at least minimal worship to the Firelord. He was served by his second-in-command, [[Flame Keeper]] [[Thazar-Ke]], nine lesser [[priest]]s, and a pair of mute personal servants.

A Kossuthan holy warrior, [[Duma Varr]], led the six guards that protected the temple and served as a personal bodyguard to So-Kehur.

==Description==
The temple stood 30' (9.1 m) high and was constructed from a combination of mortared stone and volcanic rock, with a steep roof of clay tiles. It was protected by an ''[[unhallow]]'' [[spell]], which had been linked to an ''[[invisibility purge]]'' enchantment. The cupola stood two stories above the temple's upper floor and was protected by a pair of [[gargoyle]]s, who protected the skies of the greater enclave and were occasionally rewarded with the leftovers of Kossuth's sacrifices.

Its main worship area, which featured vaulted ceilings and a sand-strewn floor, had a large fire pit with a flame that burned at all hours of the day. On Kossuthan holy days it was stoked to greater heights and was only lowered on occasions when priests and faithful were required to perform feats of fire-walking atop its smoldering coals. Set to the side of this grand chamber was the private room of the temple's Flame Keeper, Thazar-Ke. Across the hall was the private chamber of the [[Knights of the Fire Drake|Knight of the Fire Drake]], Duma Varr, who led the temple guards. The halls beyond the central chamber had five small bunk rooms which housed the lesser acolytes that saw to the temple's day-to-day operations.

The upper floors contained the high priest's spacious private chamber, the temple library, and a well-protected sacistry that held the clergy's holy regalia and divine implements.

==History==
The Kossuthan temple was built over an older temple of [[Waukeen]] that was leveled upon the founding of the enclave.
