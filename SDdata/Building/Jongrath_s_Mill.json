        "mainbody": "ongraths Mill was a wheelmill in Tethyr, known locally as Stump Hill, owned and operated by Ilmurk Jongrath. On the property was the working mill, a cottage that could be rented, livestock, and a large horse stable. It was in operation around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DRThe date is estimated from the fact that Marilyn Haresdown, as Duchess of the Purple Marches, occasionally visited the Mill in disguise. She became Duchess in 1369 DR.\nJongraths Mill was located about a days ride east of Krennasar in rural Bardshyr county in the Duchy of the Purple Marches, Tethyr. \nThere were three main buildings all surrounding a millrun where draft horses were harnessed to the spokes of a large wheel. The mill itself was tall enough to house the shaft-and-gear mechanism&mdasha thick horizontal shaft made from tree trunks held up by tripods so the horses could walk beneath&mdashthat turned the millstone. There was also a secondary shaft that was used to pump water from a deep well. All doors and windows were adorned with \"snap-traps\" of Jongraths own design to keep vermin from spoiling his grain and flour. Jongrath slept in the millhouse to guard his valuables and left the house available for renters.\nthumb|center|650px|Cutaway view of the mill showing gears and shafts connecting the millstone to the horse-powered millrace.

Plus, there were high rafters that anchored hoists and pulleys and served as a drying area for Jongraths painted works (shields, carriage doors, etc.). The cottage was a modest two-story house with furnishings.\nJongraths holdings were mostly scrub land on which his livestock were free to roam. The borders were made of large stones and tree stumps, thus giving Jongraths Mill the local name of Stump Hill. There was no running water.\nthumb|right|275px|The cottage for rent.

It was said that Jongrath hid the shield well somewhere on his land and waited for her return."
