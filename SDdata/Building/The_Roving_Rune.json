        "Rumors and Legends": "Touching the roving rune was apparently a very pleasant experience, which was in part why the tavern maintained such a popularity. Those who were sad found their spirits brightened. For these reasons, many planned to say their goodbyes in the inn, hoping the rune would be spotted."
