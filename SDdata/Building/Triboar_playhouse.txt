The '''Triboar playhouse''' was a theater in the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group="note">The name of this site is unknown in both the ''Honor Among Thieves'' movie and novelization. The name 'Triboar playhouse' is taken from the [https://web.archive.org/web/20230125155752/https://www.gamestop.com/toys-games/board-games/products/monopoly-dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-movie-edition-board-game/357169.html Monopoly Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Movie Edition Board Game].

==Structure==
It was built with stone walls and wooden beams supported the peaked roof, which included a skylight.

==Interior==
The theater was small and shabby. Illumination was provided by a chandelier like an [[iron]] wagon wheel topped with [[candle]]s.

The stage was framed by split arches, with a backcloth bearing a sun-like design. Around the base were moldings of the town's insignia displaying three boars' heads face-on and images from Triboar's history and legends:

==Activities==
It seemed just anyone could put on a show here. In a pinch, people could also find a place to sleep here, whether over night or just during a particularly dull performance.

==History==
[[File:Triboar playhouse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''He should've used his ''prestidigitation'' for canned applause and laughter too.'']]
In the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the penniless [[sorcerer]] [[Simon Aumar]] returned to Triboar and found work as a stage magician at the Triboar playhouse, but also as a petty thief. He would cast [[cantrip]]s and put on poor performances while using a ''[[mage hand]]'' spell to pickpocket members of his audience remotely. His audiences were utterly unimpressed by his ''[[prestidigitation]]s'', such as ''[[Firefinger (cantrip)|firefinger]]'', turning only slightly blurry, and producing the smell of freshly cut grass. When his former partners-in-crime [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] came looking for him, Simon was surprised to see them, lost concentration, and dropped the ball of stolen valuablesâ€”loudly. With that, he magically transformed his audience into an angry mob looking for justice. When a big guy grabbed him, Simon tried to cast a ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' spell but inadvertently got a ''[[reverse gravity]]'' instead, plunging them to the ceiling, where they kept pursuing until he dropped them again. The next time he tried this, Simon flew through the skylight outside the playhouse, where Holga caught him. The trio rode swiftly out of town.
