The Tethyr Mills, located just outside the walls of Myratma along the River Ith, was one of the largest textile mills in all of Faerûn.
It produced some of the best silks outside of Kara-Tur as well as popular waterproof canvases for tents and sails. The silks were the first choice for fine clothiers in Calimshan and Amn.
