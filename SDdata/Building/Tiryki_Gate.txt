Tiryki Gate was a southeast-facing gate in the exterior walls of Port Nyanzaru in Chult. It connected the interior Market Ward to the exterior district of Tiryki Anchorage.
Pedestrians who entered through the gate from Tiryki Anchorage to the Market Ward had to ascend a set of stairs. In doing so, they were said to escape the stench of dinosaur dung and refuse into the finer fragrances of inner Port Nyanzaru.
The ramparts atop the gate afforded a clear view of Tiryki Anchorage at least as far as the outlying dinosaur pens. In cases of attack, a horn would be sounded to signal for the people of Tiryki Anchorage to flee through Tiryki Gate to the safety of the walls. However, the gate would also be locked to protect the wards inside the city, and so those who lived outside had to be quick.
During dinosaur races, the area of the Market Ward just inside the gate was a hangout for bookies and gamblers. Tiryki Gate sometimes served as the starting and finishing point for such events, The merchant princes of the city would stand atop the gate to congratulate race winners.
During the events of the death curse in the late 15 century DR, Tiryki Gate was breached by the forces of the infernal pirate captain Idrianne Smoke.
