The '''Cloven Ogre''' was a tavern located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Location==
The Cloven Ogre was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] in the north section of the city. It was found along the [[Street of Delights]] near [[Wizards' Way]].

==Description==
The graphic sign hanging in front of the Cloven Ogre depicted a [[beastman]] having his face split in two by an [[axe]]. Both halves of the beastman's face appeared to be in a great amount of pain.

==Inhabitants==
The Cloven Ogre was a popular haunt for young [[Zhentilar]] soldiers both on and off duty.
