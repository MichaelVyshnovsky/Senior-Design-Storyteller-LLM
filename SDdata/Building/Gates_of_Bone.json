        "mainbody": "'''The Gates of Bone''' served as the main gate of [[Surcross]], [[Thay]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The gates passed through the imposing [[Wall of Crypts]] which encircled the town.",
        "Description": "The gate was comprised of the bones of a multitude of [[humanoid]]s and [[beast]]s. They only opened or closed upon being commanded by a [[necromancer]] of sufficiently high rank within the Thayan military.",
        "Powers": "If any living creature other than one with the authority to command the gate attempted to force the gates open&mdash;or even simply loitered near them for more than a few minutes&mdash;the bones would animate as an [[undead]] [[construct]] and attack. while the limbs would reach and grasp at targets, immobilizing them and wracking their bodies with [[necromantic]] energies.\n\nThe Gates were resilient in the face of all attacks save for [[fire]] or radiant energies, the latter of which also weakened the Gates' grasping arms.",
        "Defenses": "If needed, the Gates could be reinforced instantly by Thayan soldiers arriving via ''[[teleportation circle]]s'' from the city's [[Garrison (Surcross)|Garrison]]."
