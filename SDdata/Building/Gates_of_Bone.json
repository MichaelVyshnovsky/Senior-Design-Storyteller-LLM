        "mainbody": "The Gates of Bone served as the main gate of Surcross, Thay as of the late 15 century DR. The gates passed through the imposing Wall of Crypts which encircled the town.\nThe gate was comprised of the bones of a multitude of humanoids and beasts. They only opened or closed upon being commanded by a necromancer of sufficiently high rank within the Thayan military.\nIf any living creature other than one with the authority to command the gate attempted to force the gates open&mdashor even simply loitered near them for more than a few minutes&mdashthe bones would animate as an undead construct and attack. while the limbs would reach and grasp at targets, immobilizing them and wracking their bodies with necromantic energies.\nThe Gates were resilient in the face of all attacks save for fire or radiant energies, the latter of which also weakened the Gates grasping arms.\nIf needed, the Gates could be reinforced instantly by Thayan soldiers arriving via teleportation circles from the citys Garrison."
