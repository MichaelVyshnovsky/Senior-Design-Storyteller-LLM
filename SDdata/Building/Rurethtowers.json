        "mainbody": "urethtowers was a castle in the north-western part of Sembia.\nSituated within a woodland populated by stags, the castle stood east of the northernmost edge of the Arch Wood, right across the border into Sembia.\nThe castle of Rurethtowers was made of stone and had four towers. The castles substantial cellars prompted speculations of its potential connection to the Underdark. Though there was no evidence, the connection was possible through the cellars intersecting with underground passages.\nFor years Rurethtowers drew adventurers hoping to discover the hidden bandit treasure said to be concealed within the castles walls.\nIn the 1460s DR, treasure-hunters began vanishing, reportedly pursued by some monsters lurking within Rurethtowers. According to different reports, it was possible that the place was inhabited by more than one type of dangerous creatures."
