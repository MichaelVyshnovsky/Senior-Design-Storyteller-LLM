The '''House of Steel''' was the oldest [[Church of Garagos|Garagathan]] temple and later an abandoned underground temple of [[Garagos]] in [[Westgate]] during the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]. It became a subterranean temple and the cult of the Reaver even after [[1018 DR]].

==History==
Until his death in [[927 DR]], Reaver King [[Gostaraj]] led the House of Steel. His successor [[Altarl Campion]] as King implemented the [[Templeban Edict]] that forced the House of Steel alongside all other religious temples underground or moved outside Westgate. The sewers and underground passages of Westgate were rife with old altars and symbols of [[Garagos]]. This last bastion of the Reaver's faith was connected in Westgate's catacombs during the Templeban Edict era.

During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]] Garagos rampaged throughout [[Westgate]] and indirectly affected the underground temple's popularity in the city.{{Cite web enhancement/Westgate Timeline|11}}

In [[1368 DR]], the House of Steel was headed by a priestess of Garagos, Favored High Reaver [[Chaless|Chaless the Cruel]]. By then, the cult membership had dwindled to under ten.

The more than a century abandoned structure lay directly beneath [[Darkdance Manor]] and as of [[1480 DR]] was the lair of the [[vampire]] [[Kirenkirsalai]]. The [[monk]] acquiescence of [[Kalen Dren]] named [[Hessar]] knew how to safely navigate and enter the underground temple because of the vampire. As food for the new vampire [[Vaelis]], Hessar died here.

==Members==
There were a total of six priests in the temple by [[1368 DR]]. The size declined since the heyday under the reign of [[Gostaraj|Gostaraj the Reaver King]].

During its occupation by the [[:Category:Inhabitants of the House of Steel|faithful]] of Garagos, the House of Steel was well-guarded by many animated [[sword]]s against the unbelievers. Noted on [[Eleasis 3]] {{YearlinkName|1480}} by monk [[Hessar]], the temple rusted defenses used the sewers and passage walls to ambush, but could be bypassed by a certain passphrase.

==Location==
The temple lay directly beneath the intersection of [[East Market Street]] and [[Silverpiece Way]] near the center of the city, almost underneath [[Darkdance Manor]].
