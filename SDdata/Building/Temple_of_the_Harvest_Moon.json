        "mainbody": "The Temple of the Harvest Moon, which partially included the renovated Moon Tower, was a holy house dedicated to the worship of Chauntea within Harrowdale during the midâ€“14 century DR. It was a particularly wealthy church dedicated to the Great Mother, run by the extremely accomplished High Mother Harvestmistress Yvonna Oakenstave.\nThe temple itself was a massive, square stone building constructed around a rounded spire known as the Moon Tower. The walls at the peak of the tower ended in jagged spurs and the topmost floor was torn from the circular tower, and never replaced. In its places, between the spurs was an enormous copper moon that had been enchanted by a continuous everbright spell and illuminated with perpetual faerie fire. At night, this radiant beacon was visible for miles away. \nBeneath the tower, the temple was a hollow square with an interior courtyard. The wealth of the establishment was obvious by its lavish decor. The atmosphere of this temple was quite serene, and the staff and guards all spoke in hushed tones.\nThe Harvest Moon was staffed by 20 or so priests and priestesses of Chauntea and guarded by about as many warriors of the faith.\nClergy of the Harvest Moon spent little time in prayer and rather were often found gardening, assisting farmers throughout the Dales, and assisting travelers and pilgrims during their journeys. Due to this altruism, the temple received many substantial, heartfelt donations, which in turn were used to rebuild roads and renew the farmlands of the surrounding areas.\nIn addition to their guidance and support, the Chauntean clerics offered healing, food, and protection to travelers free of charge or obligation. Those who stayed at the temple with the clergy for more than one night, under the open sky during fair weather to show reverence to the Great Mother, were expected to assist with gardening and chores on the temple grounds.\nWhile the temple itself was relatively new, the Moon Tower was believed to predate the Dales themselves, part of a baronial keep that, at one time, served as the home of King Flymder or the pirate, Hantras Wolthead, depending on who was asked.\nLocal legend stated the destroyed top floor of the Moon Tower had been ripped away by a disgruntled dragon."
