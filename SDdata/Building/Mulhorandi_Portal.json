        "mainbody": "ulhorandi Portal was the name given to an extremely obscure portal in the Raurin Desert, the work of the ancient wizard-kings of Imaskar.\nThe portal lay in a ruin hidden beneath the sands of the Raurin, close to a temple of Set as of . It was momentarily revealed on occassion by the shifting of the winds, but it would always go back to being hidden by the sand shortly after.\nThe portal itself was keyed to a release of divine magic through a spell of evil or darkness, which would activate the portal for a few seconds. While activated, it rendered its surface a rippling sheet of darkness, giving no clue of what may lay on the other side.\nThe portal led to an unnamed Outer Plane which resembled the Raurin, with the sun in perpetual twilight. There were no native creatures. Though the atmosphere was breathable, there was nothing to eat or drink. The portal on the returning side was malfunctioning, likely stranding visitors to the plane.\nThe Outer Plane beyond the portal may have been a repository of ancient Imaskari magic, sure to draw the attention of Red Wizards or Imaskari liches. Had the priests of Set uncovered it, they might have also used it as a retreat."
