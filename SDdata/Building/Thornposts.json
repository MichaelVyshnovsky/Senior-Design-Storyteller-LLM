        "mainbody": "'''Thornposts''' was the grand manor home of cartographer [[Lorimel Rustellur]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Thornposts stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] on a street that crossed the [[Court Close]] that laid to the west from the establishment. The manor stood across the street from [[the Mare's Tail]] tavern and two doors west of [[Taneth's Feasthall]]. The building was a large L-shaped residence.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century DR, Thornposts was the destination for those seeking to acquire [[map]]s and floor pans of mansions, keeps, and nobles' estates of Cormyr. These maps were available for purchase by anyone who had at least 1,000 [[gold]] [[coin]]s handy. The only types of maps Lorimel Rustellur never sold were of buildings that belonged to the Crown of Cormyr, the [[Obarskyr]] royal family or any civic buildings. Lorimel also offered custom map drawing services, but such orders were priced at least at 2,000 [[gp]] with 800 gp extra for his travel expenses."
