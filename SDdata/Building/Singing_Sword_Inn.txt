The '''Singing Sword''' was a small and charming inn located within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was a great retreat for locals and travelers who sought a quiet, and luxurious overnight stay. 

Beneath the inn, on the ground floor, was the [[Sword Tables Dining Lounge]], a restaurant that replaced the Sword's stables, which were relocated to nearby abandoned house. Both the inn and restaurant were located on [[Waelstar Way]] in the eastern side of the [[Altarside]] neighborhood.
