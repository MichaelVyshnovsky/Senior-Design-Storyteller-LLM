The '''Willing Smile''' was a brothel in [[Suzail]] with a reputation as a seedy establishment that employed workers too young or too old for mainstream clients. In reality, it was a clean and quiet, if somewhat rundown house of pleasure. 

==Inhabitants==
The proprietress, [[Maraedra|Mother Maraedra]], was an old friend of [[Elminster]].
