The interior was poorly lit and shabby.\nFood served here consisted mostly of dried fish, waybread, and rabbit-and-fowl stew. Drink consisted of a house wine. The fares were cheap in the Red Gauntlet with a plate of food running just 3 cp and a tankard 2 cp.\nThe Red Gauntlet allowed patrons to drink themselves to sleep and stay, provided they did not snore too loudly. Anyone becoming rowdy or threatening was slipped a sleep syrup in their drink to placate them.\nThe Red Gauntlet was owned by a retired thief named Daunt Buirune."
