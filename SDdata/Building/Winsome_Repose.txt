The Winsome Repose was a riverfront inn in Zazesspur and one of the largest inns within that city.
The inn sat in the western side of the Ships District of the High City and overlooked the Sulduskoon River.
The building was four stories tall, making it stand out from other locations on its street.
The inn was kept in fine condition. 
The Winsome Repose surpassed many other inns in quality and served decent meals, making it a favorite among adventurers. 
The innkeeper was a man named Quarlo.
Future-queen Zaranda Star once stayed at this inn with her companions Farlorn Half-Elven, Vander Stillhawk, and Shield of Innocence&mdashalthough the latter two slept in the stable with Zarandas talking mare.
