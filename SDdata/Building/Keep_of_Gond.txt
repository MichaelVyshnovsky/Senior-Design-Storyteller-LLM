The '''Keep of Gond''' was a temple dedicated to [[Gond]] in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
This temple was located in the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]] of Bral, on [[Sailmaker Street]] across the road from the base of the [[Golden Brotherhood]], in an out-of-way place.

==Description==
A wide variety of odd and at times annoying inventions filled this small shrine. Notably there was an articulated statue of Gond, depicting him as an aged [[gnome]] of particularly diminutive and crooked build, which could be worrying, even heretical, to Gondar from [[Toril]], where he was traditionally shown as [[human]].<ref> It was able to rise on its own and collect offerings to the Wonderbringer.

==History==
The Keep of Gond was founded by three gnomish [[priest]]s who brought the faith to [[wildspace]], but it remained obscure as of the 1360s DR.

==Reputation==
While a few [[human]] worshipers of Gond attended service at the temple, it was primarily popular among the gnomish community of Bral.
