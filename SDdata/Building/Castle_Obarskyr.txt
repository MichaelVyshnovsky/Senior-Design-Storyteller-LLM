'''Castle Obarskyr''', also known as the '''King's Castle''', was the royal palace located in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
The castle was located on a dominating hillock, separated from the rest of the city by [[Lake Azoun]], the [[Royal Gardens]], and several castles of lesser nobility. King [[Duar Obarskyr]], in the 5{{th}}-century [[DR]], called it Helmstar Castle, which he claimed had come to him in a dream.{{Cite dragon/279/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 2|83}}

==Structure==
The royal wing of the castle was decorated with purple carpets. The castle's court was renowned for the small savory pastries that were made in its kitchens.

==History==
===Faerlthann's Keep===
<!-- One or more articles link directly to this heading. If moving or deleting this heading, these links will need to be changed. -->
Faerlthann's Keep was the original stone tower on the hillside in [[Suzail]] and the historical seat of power in [[Cormyr]]. It was named after [[Faerlthann Obarskyr]], the first king of Cormyr. It was built up from the original house that stood on the spot. During the reign of [[Boldovar Obarskyr|Boldovar the Mad]], the windows of the keep were turned into barred slits.

===Noble Court===
In the years leading up to the {{YearlinkName|376}}, the aristocrats and bureaucrats had gradually been thrown out of the keep itself, and had formed a collection of stone buildings further down the hillside, known as the Noble Court, or simply the court.

===Attack by Thauglor===
In the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, [[Thauglor]], a huge [[black dragon]], attacked the castle and demolished around a quarter of it, setting fire to the remaining structure and causing extensive damage. Thauglor withdrew before the military could launch a response to his attack.

There was a legend that she was looking for a dragon to come and eat her. The sculpture had oversized hands, feet and breasts, giving it an ugly, gaudy look. Although it had been disliked by many in the royal family over the years, it had been allowed to remain on the advice of sages who thought that it would bring bad fortune to destroy it. It was moved to its last position by [[Rhigaerd II]], who took the opportunity to hide it away when a room in a turret became damaged, opening a hole. Because of the difficult access through a narrow ladder shaft, the phrase "go and polish the maiden" was sometimes used to mean "go away".
