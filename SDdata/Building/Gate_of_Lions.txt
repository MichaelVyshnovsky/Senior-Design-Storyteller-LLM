The Gate of Lions was found in the city of Muluk in the Free Cities of Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Gate of Lions was located on the western wall of the city. It opened to a garden right before the Royal Lagoon within Muluk and led to the docks.
A pair of lions was carved into the framework of the gate, giving the portal its name.
The Gate of Lions was a fortress as much as it was an entryway into Muluk. It housed 200 soldiers.
