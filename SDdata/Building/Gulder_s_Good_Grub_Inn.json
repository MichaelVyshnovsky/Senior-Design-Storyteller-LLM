It was located on the eastern edge of the city, just near the city wall.\n\nAround [[1358 DR]], it was known as a cozy establishment, typically full of regular patrons year-round, except in the worst of winter. The conditions were good and the prices cheap. However, it was commandeered by the [[Guard (Tantras)|Guard]] of Tantras for use as an army barracks during the [[Time of Troubles]] of that year."
