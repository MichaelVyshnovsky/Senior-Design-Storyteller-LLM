        "mainbody": "astle Lutwill was the fortified manor of Baron Lutwill, one of the many petty barons of Tethyr during that countrys Interregnum period.\nThe castle was located  east of the village of Masamont, which was north of the Sulduskoon River.\nThe castles keep was made of stone and stood four stories tall. It sat upon a motte, an artificial hill, surrounded by a courtyard with  walls. These walls were made of dressed stone and had sloped roofs but no crenelations. The wall itself was surrounded by a ditch partially filled with trash. A permanent bridge of wood crossed the ditch leading to the oaken gate.\nThe keep was candle-lit. Curved staircases connected the floors.\nThe second floor contained straw-stuffed pallets for sleeping for the guards.\nThe top floor of the keep was a penthouse, separated from the rest of the keep by a heavy trapdoor. This was the barons chambers. It was decorated with smelly animal pelts and tapestries. Silken pillows served for reclining. The windows of penthouse were thick, wavy glass and iron instead of arrow-slits like on the floors below.\nA detachment of trained guards, wearing steel helmet caps and hauberks, defended the castle.\nThe castle was the home of Baron Lutwill. His chamberlain was a man named Whimberton.\nIn the middle of the month of Eleasias, in the , Baron Lutwill sent out a proclamation doubling the taxes on his subjects, which included the villages of Tweyar, Pansemil, Dunod, and Masamont. The villagers were at the time under training by Star Protective Services. Some of the villagers wished to fight back, and Zaranda Star agreed to aid them. She led them on a scouting party to Masamont to determine the strength of Castle Lutwills fortifications.\nAround seven days later, on the same evening when earlier in the day Baron Lutwill had sent out half his soldiers to collect the taxes, Farlorn Half-Elven and Golden Dawn approached the castle from the east, disguised as Fyadros, the Incomparably Wonderful Bard, and Zizzy, the Wonder Horse. \"Fyadros\" convinced Whimberton to let them stay the night to entertain the keeps inhabitants.\nWell after midnight, Zaranda led her band of 50&mdashincluding the members of Star Protective Services, Balmerics mercenaries, and half of her trainees from among the local villages who had been selected by lot from volunteers&mdashto the castle. She muffled the hoofs of the horses, and they reached the walls without incident. Farlorn lowered a rope to her over the wall, and she climbed up, and padded ladders were used for the raiders to climb up. Farlorn had killed the two sentries. Nevertheless, someone spotted them and sounded an alarm, and a crossbowman from among Lutwills soldiers killed one of the peasants climbing a ladder, beginning the battle.\nZaranda sent a fireball into the barracks below, then ordered Shield of Innocence to lead a group down to it to fight any survivors of the magic blast. The gate was opened to let the rest of her raiders into the courtyard, as Vander Stillhawk tried to take out the crossbowmen shooting from the slit windows of the keep. Zaranda rushed down to the gate of the keep and used a spell to open the massive door.\nOnce inside, Zaranda fought her way upstairs with her saber Crackletongue and her spells. Meanwhile, from higher up, Whimberton used a magic ball to send lightning bolts on the invaders in the courtyard. Zaranda rushed up to the penthouse, where Lutwill and Whimberton awaited her. She fought Lutwill, a large man with a double-headed battleaxe, but Whimberton trapped her with a holding spell. A spell cast by Chenowyn caused Whimerton to fall through one of the windows to his death, freeing Zaranda from her paralysis and allowing her to cover the barons head with a wolfs pelt and stab him through the face.\nIn the end, Zarandas invaders took the castle with a loss of ten of her volunteers."
