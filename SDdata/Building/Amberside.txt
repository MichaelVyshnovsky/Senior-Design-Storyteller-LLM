Amberside was a large open market in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The market was located in the market quarter of Berdusk, just inside the citys northeast gate. The market was a maze of small tents and stalls of various colors, which were packed enough to be considered a good meeting spot for individuals who didnt want to be spotted by someone they knew.
Amberside was usually very busy, owing to the Berduskan traditions allowing its citizens to work quarter-shifts so that they could peruse the wares of the citys various shops.
The market stalls in Amberside mostly sold small, useful, and non-perishable wares, setting it apart from the more established businesses in the city that sold larger goods. Due to the heavy traffic from merchants and peddlers through Berdusk, Ambersides stalls and wares changed frequently, sometimes selling rare or exotic goods from other regions. There was also a fair amount of household ironmongery, as a result of the place being named for a blacksmith named Ilm Amberal at the markets edge.
