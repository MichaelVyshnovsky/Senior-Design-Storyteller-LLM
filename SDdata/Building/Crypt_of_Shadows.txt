The '''Crypt of Shadows''' was one of the two most significant temples of [[Osiris]] in all of [[Mulhorand]] and his preeminent temple in the town of [[Jhalhoran]].

==Description==
The Crypt resembled one of the pyramids of Mulhorand, but much smaller in size and constructed of dark [[granite]]. On the ground level, each face of the structure had several doors. The most peculiar feature of the temple was it being perpetually shrouded in shadows, which weren't caused by any visible obstructions of [[the sun]].

==Activities==
Within this temple the [[Church of Osiris]] maintained a repository of various lore on both the afterlife and Osiran teachings.
