'''Old Guild Armory''' was a small shop that dealt in arms and armor in the city of [[Phlan]] of the [[Moonsea]] region in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1350}}, the Old Guild Armory could be found in the western part of Phan, not far from the entrance to the eastern part of the city through the [[Parkside Gate]]. The shop's inventory included a vast array of mundane weapons and armor, including some clothing items, such as [[boot]]s, [[cloak]]s, and [[robe]]s.
