        "mainbody": "'''The Golden Apple''' was a locally-favoured tavern and an inn located in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|What's that bloody awful noise? Did the Golden Apple bring in another singer?|A Docks District patrollman}}",
        "Location": "The Golden Apple was a three-story building overlooking the [[Bay of Mists]] with a small plaza behind it. A sign was placed at the main entrance, advertising Apple's name and services.",
        "Services": "Entertainment, food, and drinks were served on the inn's first floor, served by several serving women. The second floor was reserved for guest lodgings.",
        "History": "The Golden Apple was an established and beloved business by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. The inn survived the strife of that year: the [[plague]] of the [[Wailing Death]] and its quarantine that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between [[Luskan]] and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, locals returned to the tavern they missed so much during the quarantine. Some of the tavern's guests included the adventuring sailors called the [[Eater-of-Garm]] and [[Nisar Zayid]] of the ''[[Midnight Rose]]'' as well as the ''Rose's'' paying passenger, Lady [[Tasina Alcrest]] of [[Umberlee]].",
        "Inhabitants": "''Circa'' 1372 DR, one of the serving minds who worked at the inn was a pleasant enough aging [[human]] woman named [[Gilda]] who greeted guests, directed them across the taproom, and escorted them to the second-floor lodgings."
