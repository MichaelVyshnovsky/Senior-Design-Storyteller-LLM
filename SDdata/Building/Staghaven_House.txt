'''Staghaven House''' was the residence of the [[Windstag]] noble family in [[Suzail]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

The front parlor had a long table, which was used for drinking.

==Defenses==
The grounds were walled. A secret tunnel connected Staghaven House's grounds with their luxury stables.{{cite book/Elminster Must Die/MMP|237-238|23}}

==History==
In the aftermath of the [[Council of the Dragon]] and ensuing massacre on late [[Mirtul]] of the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, [[Broryn Windstag]], who had remained at home for the event, had [[Irlin Stonestable]] as a guest when his servant [[Aereld]] informed him of the chaos in the wake of the killing. Though he felt it may have been exaggerated, a soon-arriving [[Sacrast Handragon]] confirmed Aereld and explained the situation was even more dire.

Other guests arriving in that day included [[Traevyn Illance]], who came to recruit the heirs into a plot to mind-control the King; [[Osbur]], with a warning for the young Windstag, and a desperate [[Marlin Stormserpent]], fearing an unknown mind-controller, actually the [[vampire]] [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|132-135|14}} Illance and Marlin plotted for a way to leverage Marlin Stormserpent's [[blueflame ghost]]s to gain the King's trust.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|141-142|15}}

Lord Windstag and all his servants were murdered shortly after by an unknown, sorcerous assailant, who cast a spell on the corpses that drove insane anyone who used magic to interrogate them.{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep|268-269|28}}
