The Pleasing Platter was a high-end restaurant in the town of Triboar in the mid–14 and late 15 centuries DR. It was located near the Everwyvern House restaurant.
The tables in this restaurant were spaced far apart and screened from each other by means of strategically placed plants, pillars and statues.
The staff of the Pleasing Platter were quick and polite in their duties. They were also known to be adept at finding ways to meet the special culinary requests of their patrons.
While patrons ate, minstrels played soft, soothing music in the background.
Typical specialties at the Pleasing Platter included smoked quail, rothé steak cooked in wine and nuts, and grilled silvertail fish. They were also known to serve venison, mountain mutton, beaver tails, salvers of wild turkey broth, as well as platters of grouse and hare. During the winter season, they typically sold ale, hot broth, sausages, and hardbread.
In the later 15 century, they were known to serve complimentary flasks of sweet water with dinner, purchased from the local apothecary Tarmock Felaskur.
In the late 15 century, their prices were comparable to that of the Everwyvern House, thus the average plate of food would often cost 25 gp.
