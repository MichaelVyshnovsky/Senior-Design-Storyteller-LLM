The '''Pleasing Platter''' was a high-end restaurant in the town of [[Triboar]] in the mid–14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was located near the [[Everwyvern House]] restaurant.

==Interior==
The tables in this restaurant were spaced far apart and screened from each other by means of strategically placed plants, pillars and statues.

==Service==
The staff of the Pleasing Platter were quick and polite in their duties. They were also known to be adept at finding ways to meet the special culinary requests of their patrons.

While patrons ate, minstrels played soft, soothing music in the background.

Typical specialties at the Pleasing Platter included smoked [[quail]], [[rothé]] steak cooked in [[wine]] and [[nut]]s, and grilled [[silvertail]] [[fish]]. They were also known to serve [[venison]], [[mountain sheep|mountain mutton]], [[beaver]] tails, salvers of wild [[turkey]] [[broth]], as well as [[platter]]s of [[grouse]] and [[hare]]. During the winter season, they typically sold [[ale]], hot broth, [[sausage]]s, and [[hardbread]].

In the later 15{{th}} century, they were known to serve complimentary flasks of ''[[sweet water]]'' with dinner, purchased from the local apothecary [[Tarmock Felaskur]].

===Prices===
In the late 15{{th}} century, their prices were comparable to that of the Everwyvern House, thus the average plate of food would often cost 25 [[gp]].
