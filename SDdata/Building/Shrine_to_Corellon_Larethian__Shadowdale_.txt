The '''Shrine of Corellon Larethian''' was a small building in the forests of [[Shadowdale]] that was somewhat difficult to find. Although it had been abandoned long before [[1369 DR]], it still served as a sanctuary to travelers in the area who could rest there safely. It had a curse placed on it that would cause an unknown effect to anyone who desecrated the sanctity of the structure.
