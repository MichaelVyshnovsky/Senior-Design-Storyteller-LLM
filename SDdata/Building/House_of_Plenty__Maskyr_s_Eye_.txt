The '''House of Plenty''' was a temple to [[Chauntea]], the Grain Goddess, in the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|24-25}}

==Location==
It was situated beside [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn.

==Activities==
The temple was sometimes used as a meeting place by the village council at times when the inn was too full of guests.

==Inhabitants==
In the late 1350s DR, services were led by [[Lharathuel Hesmyr]] a Chauntean priestess. She had two acolytes: [[Torzhin Hulvesper]], the youngest son of a local horse-breeder; [[Jhenta Sulpir]], who'd escaped an arranged marriage in [[Teziir]].
