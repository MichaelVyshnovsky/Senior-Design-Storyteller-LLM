The House of Plenty was a temple to Chauntea, the Grain Goddess, in the village of Maskyrs Eye in the Vast in the mid–14 century DR.
It was situated beside The Wizards Hand inn.
The temple was sometimes used as a meeting place by the village council at times when the inn was too full of guests.
In the late 1350s DR, services were led by Lharathuel Hesmyr a Chauntean priestess. She had two acolytes Torzhin Hulvesper, the youngest son of a local horse-breeder Jhenta Sulpir, whod escaped an arranged marriage in Teziir.
