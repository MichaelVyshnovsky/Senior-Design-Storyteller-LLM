Daggerthrust Ales was a popular brewery located in the River Quarter of Daggerford during the late 15 century DR. It was run by the married couple, Halla and Sturgin Brewer.
It was located in the building that used to house the River Shining Tavern.
The Brewer couple offered varieties of beer and ale that were reminiscent of the Golden Sands Brews that originated from Hallas native Calimshan. They loved to experiment with new recipes and every new release was a highly anticipated by local Daggerfordians.
While sales were slow at first, the brewery used no-charge sampling and the influence of distinguished locals to grow their customer base over time.
The brewery was named after the legend of Tyndal, the young man that defended himself from a tribe of lizardfolk and later went on to build the original castle in Daggerford.
