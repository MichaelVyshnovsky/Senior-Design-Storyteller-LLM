        "mainbody": "'''Wheloon Tack & Leather''' was a store in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] that sold leather goods. Its proprietor was [[Landon Bhentyl]]. It was in business by [[1358 DR]] and through [[1369 DR]].",
        "Services": "The store sold leather products of all kinds. This included clothing such as [[belt]]s, gloves, and riding [[breeches]], [[scabbard]]s for [[weapon]]s, and [[armor]]s from a light [[leather armor]] to a full [[studded leather]] armor. It also sold harnesses, [[bridle]]s, reins, and traces for [[wagon]]s suitable for up to sixteen [[horse]]s or [[oxen]]. Landon Bhentyl always kept everything in stock so a customer was never left needy. As a result, the store had a strong leathery smell."
