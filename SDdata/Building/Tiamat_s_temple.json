        "mainbody": "'''Tiamat's temple''' was an unholy fortress dedicated to the worship of [[Tiamat]], the Queen of Dragons. Resting within her realm on the plane of [[Avernus]] on the [[Nine Hells]], the temple briefly ascended to [[Toril]] at the [[Well of Dragons]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The temple could be found in [[Tiamat's Lair]], the goddess' [[divine realm]] in Avernus.",
        "Structure": "The layout of the temple vaguely resembled a five-pointed star, with five chapels built at each of the star's points around a central apse. Each chapel corresponded to one of the five colors of [[chromatic dragon]]s that composed Tiamat's physical form. Massive spires featuring angular architecture rose {{SI|50|ft}} above both the apse and the five surrounding chapels. The surrounding spires featured imposing, twisting steeples that came together to at the central spire.\n\nThe central spire rose another {{SI|100|ft}} above the point where all the spires met, terminating in a site referred to as the temple's sanctuary.",

            "Atmosphere": "Despite the magnificence of its size and grand implications of its arrival to the Realms, Tiamat's temple held an aura of bleak lifelessness,"

        "History": "In the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} [[Red Wizards]] from [[Thay]] worked alongside the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to perform a powerful ritual that summoned Tiamat's temple―and the goddess Tiamat herself―to the Well of Dragons in [[Faerûn]]. as sacrifice to the Dragon Queen.\n\nThe response to the Dragon Cult's actions were profound. An enormous allied army assembled by the [[Council of Waterdeep]] descended upon the Well of Dragons.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}}\n\nGroups of adventurers including the [[Heroes of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] defeated the Red Wizard that summoned Tiamat to her temple, and defended the [[cleric]]s working with [[Linu La'neral]] to inflict vulnerability upon the Dragon Goddess. Eventually Tiamat was sent back down to the Nine Hells, and adventurers representing the [[Five Factions]] of the Sword Coast abducted Severin himself.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Within the hoard that was amassed by the Cult of the Dragon to appease Tiamat were the goddess' ''[[Tiamat's Orb of Majesty|orb of majesty]]''. powerful [[item enchantment|enchanted]] cloaks associated with [[Lathander]] and the [[elven]] [[Seldarine]], and the rare tome ''[[Icantations of the Dragon Queen]]''."
