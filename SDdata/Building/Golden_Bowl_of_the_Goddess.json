        "mainbody": "The Golden Bowl of the Goddess was a temple dedicated to Chauntea and located at the highest point of the city of Iriaebor in the Western Heartlands. It was dwarfed only by the taller spires of the High Tower of Iriaebor.\nThe Golden Bowl was a big temple, being home to more than forty priests.\nThe uppermost floor of the temple was unroofed, and magically heated. Plants and flowers cultivated there would bloom even in the middle of winter, and were distributed to the townspeople to lift their spirit.\nThe priests of the temple spent most of their days outside the temple, helping the faithful with their agricultural duties."
