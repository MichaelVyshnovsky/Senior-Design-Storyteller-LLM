        "mainbody": "'''The Tower of Bones''' was the center for magical research by [[necromancer]]s that was built during [[Myth Drannor]]'s renaissance, overlooking the city's [[Polyandrium]]. The tower served as a base of operations for the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in [[1369 DR]].",
        "Location": "The Tower of Bones stood to the north of the monument in the center of the Polyandrium.",
        "Structure": "The Tower of Bones was a three-story-tall structure with an open rooftop and two underground levels. The tower's second and third floors had narrow window openings, but they were too high up from the floor and too small for a person to squeeze through. The entry door to the tower was made out of thick and heavy iron-bound wood.",
        "Interior": "Most rooms inside the tower were lit with wall fixtures enchanted with the ''[[continual flame]]'' spell. The doors inside the tower were made out of wood. The tower's interior was permeated with a lingering stench of decay that was barely shifted by the air moving through the narrow arrow-slit windows.\n\n[[File:Robalend lukka.png|thumb|269x269px|''[[Robalend Lukka]] about to be killed and turned into an undead by the Cult of the Dragon on the Tower of Bones' roof.'']]\nThe main hall behind the entrance door led to stairs up and down. Most rooms on the first and second floors were repurposed into barracks by the cult. The third floor housed the Tower of Bones's library and High Priest Ryngoth's room.\n\nThe basement levels of the tower were used as a prison both by the Cult and by the necromancers of Myth Drannor. The cultists established a shrine to [[Velsharoon]] in one of the basement's rooms, close to both the tower's kitchen and the cult's experimentation room, where the necromancers directed and experimented on a variety of living and deceased creatures. Further into the sub-levels were multiple storage rooms, a [[zombie]] repository where the cultists herded their undead laborers when not in use, and the morgue.",
        "History": "During Myth Drannor's glory days, the city was a safe haven for learning, which included the study of arcane magics. The city attracted scholars and magic-users from across the realms of all alignments. Among these pilgrims were a few groups of evil necromancers that wanted to use Myth Drannor's promise of peaceful study and research among all, to pursue their arts while avoiding incivility.\n\nSome of these wizards settled in Myth Drannor's graveyard, the Polyandrium, just outside of the city's ''[[mythal]]''. They were allowed to erect the Tower of Bones, despite many protests by the citizens of Myth Drannor. The Polyandrium's location provided the necromancers with much-desired isolation from the masses.\n\nAfter the Myth Drannor's fall in the [[Weeping War]] in [[714 DR]], the necromancer residents of the Tower of Bones fled in the face of the invading hordes, leaving the tower abandoned, until [[1369 DR]], when the Cult of the Dragon moved into the ruins of Myth Drannor to use its ''mythal'' and the resurgent ''[[pool of radiance]]'' to conquer the region.",
        "Inhabitants": "In 1369 DR, the Tower of Bones housed a cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] that was in charge of excavating the tombs of Polyandrium. It included twelve soldiers, six sentries, six guards, nine wizards (all necromancers), the High Priest [[Ryngoth]], and his [[badger]] companion [[Zulkir (badger)|Zulkir]]. The cultists routinely transformed living slaves into subservient undead, in a ritual that took place on the tower's rooftop."
