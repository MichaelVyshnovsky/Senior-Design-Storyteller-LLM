        "mainbody": "The '''Palace of the Purple Emperor''' was the residence of the Lord Artificer of [[Imaskar]] as of {{Yearlink|-2488}}. In [[1374 DR]], a wizard from [[Deep Imaskar]], [[Ususi Manaallin]], began exploring the palace, and later founded [[Skyclave]] around it.",
        "Location": "While it was initially built in [[Inupras]],\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the palace was known to remain in the Raurin desert all the time, but not to vanish. Empress Ususi Manaallin moved it to the empty plains of [[Mulhorand]] to found Skyclave.",
        "Defenses": "The palace was not normally accessible from outside, and in fact spent most of its time secreted away in the [[Celestial Nadir]].\n\nIts lowest balcony was two or three hundred feet into the air; openings on its surface could open and close of their own accord.\n\nWhen a trio of [[elf|elven]] gatherers from [[Al Qahara]] found an entrance into the Palace, two of them went in and remained inside for hours. Finally, the one who remained behind attempted to enter the palace with [[magic]] and found all her efforts thwarted. When she finally returned to Al Qahara, she died mysteriously in her sleep. A curse was suspected.\n\nThe [[Imperial Weapons Cache]] contained innumerable imprisoned monsters, including a [[storm giant]], a [[mountain troll]], and several mantis warriors, probably [[thri-kreen]]. Extinct species such as [[shadow eft]]s were also included in it.",
        "Interior": "The Palace was the best known example of [[Imaskari]] architecture. Its extra-dimensional spaces made it ten times bigger on the inside than on the outside, with many of them being used as vaults or arcane chambers.\n\nThe mind of Pandorym, an [[elder evil]], was held within the Imperial Weapons Cache.\n\nBy {{yearlink|1479}}, Ususi had moved the entire palace away from its original position, but its groundwork had remained behind. Thus, the original foundations and sublevels stayed now under the sand.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|224}}",
        "History": "According to Monolith, a Prince of Elemental Earth, the stonework of the Palace of the Purple Emperor was about five thousand years old in the 14{{th}} century DR. This would place its stonework around the −35{{th}} century DR, centuries after the reunification of [[Imaskar]].\n\nIn the year −2488 DR, the Palace of the Purple Emperor was the only building to survive the fighting between Lord Artificer [[Yuvaraj]] and the [[avatar]]s of the [[Mulan]] gods. The subsequent destruction created the [[Raurin|Raurin desert]], which would afterwards cover the palace with purple sand. By [[1372 DR]], the palace would be entirely buried under the sand, except for a single spire.\n\nA wizard from Deep Imaskar, Ususi Manaallin, began exploring the palace in [[1374 DR]] after sealing Pandorym in the Imperial Weapons Cache. Using magic, she moved the palace to the empty plains of Mulhorand and founded Skyclave around it.",

        "Trivia": "There was a picture of the Palace of the Purple Emperor in the Office of the [[Lord Apprehender]] of [[Deep Imaskar]] as of 1374 DR, which the [[Imaskari vengeance taker]] [[Iahn Qoyllor]] noticed before setting off in pursuit of Ususi Manaallin that year.{{cite book/Darkvision|250|26}}"
