The '''Bloated Gargoyle Inn''' was an [[inn]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

In the early 7th century [[DR]], the infamous pirate [[Urthag|Urthag the Knife]] boldly caroused for several hours at the Bloated Gargoyle Inn. Finally, the [[Royal Constabulary]] discovered him and tried to arrest him and Urthag fled across the rooftops of the city.{{Cite dragon/Soargar's Legacy|88–89}}
