'''Samril's Fine Blades''' was a weaponcrafting workshop in [[Secomber]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
Samril's Fine Blades was owned and operated by the Samril [[halfling]] family, and performed a wide range of tasks related to the crafting and assembly of weapons. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Arthane Furnace]] in [[Beliard]] who supplied raw blades, then sent them on to [[the Arthane Armory]] in [[Waterdeep]] for sale.

At Samril's, naked blades arrived and were sharpened with [[House of Yarthin]] [[whetstone]]s and polished with mineral powders from [[Anastur's Abrasives]]. [[Duskwood]] and [[blueleaf]] wood was obtained from [[Maraszymo Darluth]] and other local woodcutters, dried in kilns by the Samrils, and then carved and fitted as weapon grips. [[Leather]] for wrapping the grips was sourced from [[Falthryn and Daughters Tannery]] and [[Sorkryn's Soft Hides of Scornubel]], usually [[ox]]-hide or [[rothé]]-hide, with [[horse]]-hide and [[donkey]]-hide used if nothing else was available. The leather grips were secured with braided [[copper]] [[wire]] from [[Gleskur's Finemetals of Secomber]]. The pommels of their swords were usually round knobs affixed to the end of the tang, variously [[ivory]], [[bone]], or [[brass]]. Ivory was sourced from trustworthy passing merchants as available or special-ordered from Waterdeep, while a regular supply of hard-wearing [[peryton]], [[owlbear]], [[dire wolf]], and [[fire lizard]] bone was obtained from [[Galdegut's Boneyard]]. Brass and other alloys used in the construction was supplied by local bulk merchants and worked on-site by the Samrils, while ivory and bone was carved into shape by young Samrils overseen by their elders. The finished blades were coated in vine [[oil]], wrapped in [[canvas]] from local suppliers, and sealed in [[gum]] that the Samrils made from local [[lalannas vine]] and [[bitterthorn]] roots. They were then packed in crates and sealed with [[pitch]] before being sent to Waterdeep and the Arthane Armory.
