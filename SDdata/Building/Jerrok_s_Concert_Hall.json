        "mainbody": "Jerroks Concert Hall was the popular performance venue of pre-Weeping War Myth Drannor that attracted the most renowned artists, musicians, and bards with its perfect acoustics.\nJerroks Concert Hall was a large beautiful structure that was enchanted by its creator to have the perfect acoustics. Jerrok Haladrian, a famous bard and sorcerer, placed enchantments on the nodes of power the concert halls chorus stands to magically enhance his own singing through singing of his students and employees. That enchantments not only affected the bards singing, but also his song-spells.\nAfter the citys defenses were breached in the Weeping War, shortly before the fall, Jerrok Haladrian gathered surviving bards of the City of Song inside his Concert Hall to create a powerful protection spell to ward the Hall off the invading Army of Darkness. The spell was to place barriers around the building and blast away any fiend trying to approach it. As the bards spell reached its crescendo, a powerful yugoloth, Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke, forced his way past the barriers and began the carnage. The interference with the complex spell caused it to backfire, petrifying all the creatures inside the hall.\nIn 1369 DR, the statues inside the hall still held their note, loudly singing, even though the song was more reminiscent of a scream. With time, some statues have been damaged, some were decapitated by the invaders trying to stop them from singing, but that did not stop the maddening sound. Hastim of the Gentle Rebuke was one of the statues of the hall, even though not one of the singing ones.\nMost delvers that were brave enough to go inside Jerroks Concert Hall faced a chance of going mad from the sound of arcane scream-singing, possibility of petrifying, even though one female adventurer managed to get inside the hall and snatch a jeweled platinum flute before fleeing from the accursed ruckus.\nThe adventurers that frequented the dangers of the ruined city speculated that the statues were still alive, stuck in stasis and aware of their surrounding, likely driven insane by the time spent in the entrapment. \nMany assumed that Jerraks treasures were still inside the Concert Hall, defended by his magic. One such treasure of note was his magical lyre of building."
