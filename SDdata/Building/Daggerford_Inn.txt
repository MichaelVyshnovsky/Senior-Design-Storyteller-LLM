The '''Daggerford Inn''' was a large [[inn]] found in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Location==
Anyone entering Daggerford through the main [[Caravan Gate]] was greeted with the main face of the Daggerford Inn as soon as they entered the city. The inn was located at the junction of [[Duke's Way]] and [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] across from the market.

==Interior==
Plenty of thick tapestries hung around the walls aided in blocking sound from the city, ensuring guests would get a good night's sleep. A small stove was found in each room.

==Inhabitants==
The Daggerford Inn was owned by a [[dwarf]] named [[Demetira Landscraper]].
