        "mainbody": "indsong Tower was the physical location of a school of magic in the elven city of Myth Drannor. After Myth Drannors fall, the central tower was all but razed but other portions of the school survived. As of 1376 DR, many ruins of the school still existed.\nThe tower consisted of a central tower, with structures in the boughs of a massive oak, structures in the boughs of the Shadowsong Tree, and extra-dimensional spaces. Entry to the school was mainly by portal using a special ring, a Windsong Towerkin ring, that served as a special portal key. By 1376 DR, the physical tower was all but destroyed and the structures in the trees were deteriorating, but the extra-dimensional spaces were generally in good condition."
