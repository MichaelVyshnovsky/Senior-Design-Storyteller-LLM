        "mainbody": "'''Windsong Tower''' was the physical location of a school of [[magic]] in the [[elf|elven]] city of [[Myth Drannor]]. After Myth Drannor's fall, the central tower was all but razed but other portions of the school survived. As of [[1376 DR]], many ruins of the school still existed.",
        "Structure": "The tower consisted of a central tower, with structures in the boughs of a massive [[oak]], structures in the boughs of the [[Shadowsong Tree]], and extra-dimensional spaces. Entry to the school was mainly by ''[[portal]]'' using a special ring, a ''[[Windsong Towerkin]]'' ring, that served as a special portal key. By [[1376 DR]], the physical tower was all but destroyed and the structures in the trees were deteriorating, but the extra-dimensional spaces were generally in good condition."
