The Green Sword was a tavern in Leuthilspar, Evermeet.
The establishment took its name from an extremely heavy green metal sword mounted behind the counter, which supposedly belonged to a green dragon. It was too heavy for most medium humanoids to lift.
The tavern was more rowdy than the norm for elven taverns. 
In 1367 DR, the proprietor was Halanaestra.
