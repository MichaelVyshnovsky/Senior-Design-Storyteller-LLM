The '''Green Sword''' was a tavern in [[Leuthilspar]], [[Evermeet]].

==Description==
The establishment took its name from an extremely heavy green metal [[sword]] mounted behind the counter, which supposedly belonged to a [[green dragon]]. It was too heavy for most medium [[humanoid]]s to lift.

===Atmosphere===
The tavern was more rowdy than the norm for [[elf|elven]] taverns. 

==History==
In [[1367 DR]], the proprietor was [[Halanaestra]].

==Inhabitants==
*[[Halamar (Leuthilspar)|Halamar]]
