It was home to a group of [[high mage]]s.\n\nWhen Evereska was besieged by the [[phaerimm]] in the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the high mages of the Bellcrest Spire advised Lord [[Duirsar]] that, although the ''[[mythal]]'' would sustain the city, the plants would need water and light. The [[Moondark Circle]] warned Duirsar there were a dozen spells that would cut off these.<ref>"
