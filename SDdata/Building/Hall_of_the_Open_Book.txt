The Hall of the Open Book was the guildhall of the Lorekeepers Alliance that operated in the city of Myth Drannor circa the 7 century DR.
It was located on the Street of Song just east of Sixstar, the junction of six major city roads in the citys Kerradunath district.
The bottom floor of the hall comprised a library and an area dedicated to the inscription and copying of manuscripts. The second floor housed the offices of the Lorekeepers Alliance and an area for book-binding.
The halls services could be utilized by members of the guild or offered to their clientele, for a price of course.
