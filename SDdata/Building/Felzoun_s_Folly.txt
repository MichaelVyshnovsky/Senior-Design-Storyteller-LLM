In the year [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} the elderly [[Uza Solizeph]] trapped a [[gazer]] within her bookstore on [[Sorn Street]]. Knowing the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] would not aid her, due to her propensity for telling tall tales, the woman went to drown her sorrows at Felzoun's Folly. She was later met there by members of the [[Harpers]], an organization that owed her a favor, who offered to handle the [[aberration]].<ref>
