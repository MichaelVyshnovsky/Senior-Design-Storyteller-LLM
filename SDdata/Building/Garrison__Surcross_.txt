The '''Garrison''' of [[Surcross]] in [[Thay]] was a building that housed the living portion of the city's Thayan soldiers as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
It was the second-most fortified building in the city (after the [[Tombstone]]) and was a long hall of reinforced, heavy stone.

==Interior==
The building contained many inner passages, rooms, and chambers comprising the communal barracks. Each room of the barracks could house dozens of soldiers, who were segregated by race (into [[human]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[orc]]s, [[half-orc]]s, and "other") but not segregated by gender. These barracks were simple, often including not more than a [[footlocker]] and a [[cot]] for each soldier. The exception was a single, opulent room that served as the barracks for a contingent of [[warlock]]s known as the [[Sunmasters (Thay)|Sunmasters]], who had [[wardrobe]]s, luxurious [[mattress]]es, thick carpets, and fine food and [[wine]].

The structure included a main hall, at the end of which were a series of ''[[teleportation circle]]s'' that allowed the troops to instantly travel to the Tombstone, the [[Gates of Bone]], or any of the five [[Fingers of Szass Tam]].

==Defenses==
[[Undead]] guards watched the garrison's entrances and did not allow entry to anyone who did not have a pass or a uniform, either of a Thayan soldier or a [[Red Wizard]].
