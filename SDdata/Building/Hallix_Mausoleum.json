        "mainbody": "Hallix Mausoleum was the family tomb of the Hallix family of Neverwinter.\nIt was located on the west side of the Main Graveyard of Neverdeath Graveyard, in a cluster of tombs along the wall separating the Main and Paupers Graveyards. The mausoleum itself lay in the shadow of two much grander structures to its south and west.\nThe mausoleum was a plain and squat single-story building of granite that was  on a side. It was entered via metal double doors on its north side, which were kept secured by a rusty chain and padlock.\nThe inside of the mausoleum was dark with a  ceiling. The ground level contained three stone coffins on both the east and west walls, each bearing the name, birth year, and death year of a member of the Hallix family buried within. A wide set of stairs descended to the south into a large subterranean stone chamber lined with sturdy shelves holding additional stone coffins containing long-dead members of the family. In the south wall of this chamber, a secret passage&mdashopened via a hidden latch within a coffin in front of it&mdashconnected the mausoleum to the Waterclock Guilds Crypts.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the western wall of the underground chamber had collapsed, thus allowing access to the catacombs beneath Neverdeath.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the ground level of the mausoleum held the bodies of six Hallix family members who died following the eruption of Mount Hotenow.\nDuring the 1490s DR, the mausoleum and the catacombs beneath it came to be occupied by cultists of Vecna led by Jerot Galgin.\nThe cultists eventually used the area to imprison a group of four Neverwintan nobles&mdashEldon Keyward, Indrina Lamsensettle, Sarcelle Malinosh, and Umberto Noblin&mdashprompting Lord Dagult Neverember to send adventurers to rescue them."
