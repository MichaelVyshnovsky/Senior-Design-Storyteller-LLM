        "mainbody": "The '''Spinning Keep of Siri'wadjen''' was the magical structure surrounding the ''[[Calimemnon Crystal]]'' in which the [[genie]]s [[Calim]] and [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] were entrapped in the [[Calim Desert]].",
        "Location": "The Spinning Keep magically hovered and rotated exactly 44 feet (13.5 meters) above the sands of the Calim Desert, just above the height that Memnon's disembodied essence could reach.",
        "Structure": "The Keep was a twelve-sided hollow object made of crystalline stone.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note\">''[[Lost Empires of Faer√ªn]]'' describes the Keep as \"a rounded tower\" with multiple halls, but this directly conflicts with a careful reading of the description given in ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]''. It was 70 feet (21 meters) across and was the color of translucent pearl.\n\nThere were three entrances to the Keep, each protected by an exceptionally challenging arcane locking puzzle. If solved, the panel would simply vanish, allowing one to fall into the Keep.",
        "Interior": "The inside of the keep was simply an open space with no gravity.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note\" /> The ''Crystal'' floated at the very center. However, so powerful were the [[illusion]]ary spells in effect within that an intruder was not likely to even recognize that he or she had passed through the keep walls successfully. The chamber was bitter cold, and the only light came from the ''Crystal''.",
        "Defenses": "The Keep was surrounded by a powerful magical field that extended ten feet from every surface. This energy field repelled all non-living matter and [[elves]], [[dwarves]], and [[human]]s and reflected or absorbed all spells contacting it. [[Teleport]]ation and [[scrying]] magics would not pass through the barrier, and trying to pass the spellward could result in one being teleported thousands of miles away.\n\nThe interior walls were covered with razors, but these were hidden by the many illusion spells in place.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[baelnorn]] [[Pharos]] still guarded the ''Crystal'' from inside the Keep, and he had the aid of [[genie]]s and dozens of [[air elemental]]s who were also bound to guard the gem. The defenders would attempt to blast any intruders back against the razor-covered walls.",
        "History": "The [[high elf mage]] Pharos created the Keep as well as the ''Crystal'' within. By [[1374 DR]], it was nearly 9,000 years old",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Throughout the millennia of the Keep's existence, several persons have actually figured out a way to pass the Keep's magical barrier, solve its door puzzles, and view the ''Crystal'', but none have ever touched the gem, as they were driven away by Pharos and the other guardians."
