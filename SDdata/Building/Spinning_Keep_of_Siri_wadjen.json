        "mainbody": "The Spinning Keep of Siriwadjen was the magical structure surrounding the Calimemnon Crystal in which the genies Calim and Memnon were entrapped in the Calim Desert.\nThe Spinning Keep magically hovered and rotated exactly 44 feet (13.5 meters) above the sands of the Calim Desert, just above the height that Memnons disembodied essence could reach.\nThe Keep was a twelve-sided hollow object made of crystalline stone.Lost Empires of Faer√ªn describes the Keep as \"a rounded tower\" with multiple halls, but this directly conflicts with a careful reading of the description given in Empires of the Shining Sea. It was 70 feet (21 meters) across and was the color of translucent pearl.\nThere were three entrances to the Keep, each protected by an exceptionally challenging arcane locking puzzle. If solved, the panel would simply vanish, allowing one to fall into the Keep.\nThe inside of the keep was simply an open space with no gravity. The Crystal floated at the very center. However, so powerful were the illusionary spells in effect within that an intruder was not likely to even recognize that he or she had passed through the keep walls successfully. The chamber was bitter cold, and the only light came from the Crystal.\nThe Keep was surrounded by a powerful magical field that extended ten feet from every surface. This energy field repelled all non-living matter and elves, dwarves, and humans and reflected or absorbed all spells contacting it. Teleportation and scrying magics would not pass through the barrier, and trying to pass the spellward could result in one being teleported thousands of miles away.\nThe interior walls were covered with razors, but these were hidden by the many illusion spells in place.\nThe baelnorn Pharos still guarded the Crystal from inside the Keep, and he had the aid of genies and dozens of air elementals who were also bound to guard the gem. The defenders would attempt to blast any intruders back against the razor-covered walls.\nThe high elf mage Pharos created the Keep as well as the Crystal within. By 1374 DR, it was nearly 9,000 years old\nThroughout the millennia of the Keeps existence, several persons have actually figured out a way to pass the Keeps magical barrier, solve its door puzzles, and view the Crystal, but none have ever touched the gem, as they were driven away by Pharos and the other guardians."
