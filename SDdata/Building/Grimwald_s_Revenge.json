        "mainbody": "'''Grimwald's Revenge''' was an [[inn]] located in the city of [[Tilverton]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Revenge was in the middle of the [[Tilverton/Old Town|Old Town]] atop the knoll, on the [[Street of the Sorceress]].",
        "Activities": "The inn was actually owned by the [[Rogues of Tilverton]], who mainly used it as a source of legitimate income and as a meeting place for traveling merchants and caravan masters who were willing to trade directly with them and fence items. The walls of the inn were sound-proofed, making it a perfect location to operate illicit ventures, and an abundance of hidden passages and secret panels allowed the [[thieves]] to rob easy targets staying at the inn. In fact, each and every one of the stairpost knobs twisted off to reveal a cache of items including a [[dagger]], [[garotte]], face masks, and an individual packet of ''[[dust of disappearance]]''. The Revenge was also connected to the [[Tilverton/Sewers|sewers]] beneath Tilverton by secret passages.",
        "Inhabitants": "The inn was run by [[Hasantasser Bloodshoulder]] in the 1350sâ€“1360s DR. The inn seemed to have a steady population of [[frog]]s that were always hopping about.",
        "History": "The inn was named for the [[wizard]] [[Grimwald (Tilverton)|Grimwald]] and his so-called vengeance on those whom he believed wronged him. The story claimed that his enemies transformed a beautiful creation of his, and his revenge would involve turning them into frogs and seizing their possessions."
