        "mainbody": "rimwalds Revenge was an inn located in the city of Tilverton in the 14 century DR.\nThe Revenge was in the middle of the Old Town atop the knoll, on the Street of the Sorceress.\nThe inn was actually owned by the Rogues of Tilverton, who mainly used it as a source of legitimate income and as a meeting place for traveling merchants and caravan masters who were willing to trade directly with them and fence items. The walls of the inn were sound-proofed, making it a perfect location to operate illicit ventures, and an abundance of hidden passages and secret panels allowed the thieves to rob easy targets staying at the inn. In fact, each and every one of the stairpost knobs twisted off to reveal a cache of items including a dagger, garotte, face masks, and an individual packet of dust of disappearance. The Revenge was also connected to the sewers beneath Tilverton by secret passages.\nThe inn was run by Hasantasser Bloodshoulder in the 1350sâ€“1360s DR. The inn seemed to have a steady population of frogs that were always hopping about.\nThe inn was named for the wizard Grimwald and his so-called vengeance on those whom he believed wronged him. The story claimed that his enemies transformed a beautiful creation of his, and his revenge would involve turning them into frogs and seizing their possessions."
