The '''Merchant's Home''' was a [[caravanserai]] located in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

The Merchant's Home was regarded by many as being the finest caravanserai in all of Golden Huzuz.

==Description==
This five-story structure held a paved central court.

==Activities==
Due to its reputation, reservation for lodging at the Merchant's Home needed to be made at least a year in advance. Several upstanding merchants held regular rooms here.

The Merchant's Home often hired famous entertainers and even a skilled [[illusionist]] to dazzle their patrons.

[[Barber]]s and [[rawun]]s could find gainful employment here since the proprietor was always looking to extend the comfort level of his guests.

Though all caravanserai boasted that they offered everything a caravan needed, none could fulfil that promise compared to the Merchant's Home. In addition to offering fine dining, splendid lodging, and grand entertainment, the Merchant's Home could enlist outside help for fulfilling needs such as acquiring new horses or even hiring mercenaries or adventurers as caravan guards.

==Inhabitants==
[[Tun Hayal]] owned the Merchant's Home. His assistant, [[Gaitiyah al-Aranib]] handled the daily workings of the establishment.
