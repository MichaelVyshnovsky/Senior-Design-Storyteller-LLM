The Shrine was lit with Mystras Silver Fire of pure magic.\nThe Mystran sect, known as the Sisterhood of the Silver Fire was founded Anorrweyn Evensong. She was inspired by the actions of Elminster Aumar during his stay in the City of Song, that eventually led to Myth Drannor opening its gates to members of other races and its renaissance. The Sisterhood build several shrines, including the ghostly Temple of Mystra in Nightingale Court and the Shrine of the Silver Fire among the tombs of the Elven Catacombs."
