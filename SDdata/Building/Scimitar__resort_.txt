The Scimitar was a thermal resort located alongside the shore of Lake Esmel in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Named after the scimitar-shaped peninsula in which it was located, this large resort was built near hot springs and had access to icy lake waters.
The Scimitar was a place of relaxation and hedonism. It offered a variety of services to its customers, such as
* Bath houses
* Swimming
* Fishing
* Private gaming
* Gambling halls
* Dancing
It was known for the staff to also offer custom services to better satisfy their wealthy visitors desires.
Although largely owned by the Church of Waukeen, their priests assumed no direct control over the resort. The place was managed by the Janyskyvaar Cabal, a holding company watching over the interests of the majority shareholder, the Jashire family of Riatavin.
Customers entered the resort through a fortified gateway constantly guarded by mercenaries.
The resort was founded by a priest of Waukeen after he discovered mineral springs in Akaravs Bay, giving his name to the bay in the process.
