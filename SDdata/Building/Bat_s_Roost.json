        "mainbody": "The Bats Roost was a tavern in the Central Port of Skullport.\nThe tavern was located in the northwest corner of the Central Port near the Pierced Navel and Gentlemans Groggery.\nThe tavern was fair condition with damp wood and aged stone walls. The place was said to have smelled strongly of bat excrement. A wired obstacle-course arena was positioned near the main taproom, which was used to host bat fighting contests.\nThe Roost was well known as a place for trained bat fights. Based on size and power, patrons would bet on which bat was knocked to the ground or drew the first blood.\nAround 1366 DR, Schiropts won the Bats Roost tavern after his bat familiar won a fighting tournament."
