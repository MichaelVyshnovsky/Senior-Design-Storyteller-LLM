        "mainbody": "'''Elhazir's Exotica''' was a popular but expensive gift shop found in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]] in the mid- to late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], which sold rare and unusual gifts and treasures.",
        "Location": "The shop was located in the center of the city, across the street from [[Phaesha's]] boarding house and [[Vondor's Shoes and Boots]].",
        "Description": "Elhazir's Exotica was filled with elegant display cases, rich carpet, and a professional staff.",
        "Services": "This gift shop had a well-earned reputation for providing rare and wondrous items such as [[wyvern]]skull bathtubs, [[dragon]]scale shields, and many more curiosities. Many of these rare treasures were purchased directly from [[adventurer]]s and sold to rich [[Sembia]]n clientele.\n\nIt was known to a select few that Elhazir also sold enchanted [[dagger]]s and authentic dragon eggs, though these were not on display in the shop and were stored in a locked room. The [[mage]] enchanted the daggers himself, usually granting them powers such as ''[[feather fall]]ing'', ''[[light]]'', or ''[[faerie fire]]''.",
        "Inhabitants": "All of the sales staff of the shop were the daughters of [[Elhazir]]. Some of the daughters were talented mages, allowing them to easily spot potential [[thieves]]. [[Chantra|One of the daughters]] even had use of the ''[[time stop]]'' spell for use in dire situations."
