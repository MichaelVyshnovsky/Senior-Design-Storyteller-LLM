East Torch Tower was the formal name given to one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeeps Trollwall, located in the citys Dock Ward.The sourcebook City System states that all torchtowers with names are "major towers".
This tower was situated next to the Dock Wards Guard Barracks.The sourcebook City of Splendors Waterdeep incorrectly states that this is part of the Southern Ward.
This tower stood five stories tall.
Being a torchtower, East Torch Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes.  Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.
Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.
East Torch Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch.
