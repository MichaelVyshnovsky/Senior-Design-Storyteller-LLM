The '''House of Kuldath''' was the storefront and headquarters for the [[Kuldath]] merchant house within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]. The five brothers of the family, [[Aldeemo Kuldath|Aldeemo]], [[Belurith Kuldath|Belurith]], [[Narammus Kuldath|Narammus]], [[Ospim Kuldath|Ospim]] and [[Raethrif Kuldath|Raethrif]], imported and sold [[carpet]]s and [[tapestries]] from other lands, specifically those that were made at the hands of [[slave]]s, possibly from their hometown of [[Laothkund]] in [[Thay]].

==Rumours==
Locals of the [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood swore the house was protected by a monstrous, [[bat]]-like creature that flew around its ceiling at night.
