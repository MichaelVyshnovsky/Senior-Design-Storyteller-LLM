The House of Kuldath was the storefront and headquarters for the Kuldath merchant house within the city of Ravens Bluff. The five brothers of the family, Aldeemo, Belurith, Narammus, Ospim and Raethrif, imported and sold carpets and tapestries from other lands, specifically those that were made at the hands of slaves, possibly from their hometown of Laothkund in Thay.
Locals of the Swordspoint neighborhood swore the house was protected by a monstrous, bat-like creature that flew around its ceiling at night.
