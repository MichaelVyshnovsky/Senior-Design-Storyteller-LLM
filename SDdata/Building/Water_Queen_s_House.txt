The Water Queens House was a temple of Umberlee in Baldurs Gate in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was the citys oldest temple
 and one of the only true temples to the Sea Queen in the Realms at the time, thanks to the tolerance and openness of the Baldurians. The name was said to be a euphemism.

As of 1482 DR, Allandra Grey served as Flood Tide of the temple, and led about twenty priestesses, called waveservants.
