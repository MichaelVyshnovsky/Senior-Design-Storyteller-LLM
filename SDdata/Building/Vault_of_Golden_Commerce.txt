The '''Vault of Golden Commerce''' was the central temple of the [[Church of Nephthys]].

==Location==
This temple was located in the nation of [[Mulhorand]], in the wealthy city of [[Neldorild]].

==Structure==
The Vault was a massive, long rectangular structure constructed of white [[marble]]. It lacked windows, had a steeply sloping roofing, and only a large single set of doors at one end. Before this door stood a massive colonnade and leading up to it from the streets was a steep set of stairs.
===Interior===
The interior of the temple was painted with the blood of [[dragon]]s and [[gorgon]]s, then enspelled with numerous wards.

Inside the Vault was host to vast galleries of art pieces, statuary, and tapestries from all across [[Toril]]. These were all illuminated by a golden radiance given off by ''[[continual light]]'' [[spell]]s. Within the lower levels of the Vault, legendary wealth amounts of wealth were stored.

==Activities==
The clergy of this temple acted as the administrative body of Neldorild. They also oversaw, alongside the city's [[Church of Thoth|Thothian]] clergy, the nearby [[papyrus]] slave farms along the delta of the [[River of Spears]]. This generated a great deal of wealth for both clergies.

On a bi-weekly schedule, the [[priest]]esses of the Vault held revels that were considered to be the pinnacle of the social calendar among those in Neldorild. They served as a great way to generate revenue for the church, as wealthy merchants and the nobility could only enter the Vault if they paid a hefty fee.

==Inhabitants==
The entrance to the Vault was guarded by a pair of [[iron golem]]s.
