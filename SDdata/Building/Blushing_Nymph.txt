The Blushing Nymph, or just the Nymph, was a festhall in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR.
It stood on the north side of Rainrun Street, two buildings west of the corner with Cook Street.
The mage Zabbas Thuul rented rooms here around 1372 DR.
The backyard or alley behind the Blushing Nymph was the haunt of stray cats and garbage. The staff tossed drunks out the door here too.
From an oubliette (in fact, a covered garbage pit) in the alley, a passage known as the Long Dark Stair led down into the first level of Undermountain.
