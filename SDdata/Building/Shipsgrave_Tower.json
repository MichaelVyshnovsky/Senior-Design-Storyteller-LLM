        "mainbody": "he Shipsgrave Tower was one of the most prominent temples dedicated to Umberlee, the Bitch Queen, located in the Tethyrean city of Velen.\nThe Shipsgrave Tower stood on the crossing of Riptide Walk, the main road in Velen that crossed the city from east to west, and Sundown Street.\nThe Shipsgrave Tower was a three-storied dark tower with windows on each floor. It rose above the western part of Velen, near the Sea Gate. The temple moaned when sea winds touched it and continued its ominous lament afterward, even on clear days.\nThe temples interior matched its ominous exterior. Its gloomy atmosphere echoed the clashing waves in Velens harbors with the moans of souls drowned at sea and the cracking of sinking shattered ships.\nA certain grim ritual took place in the Shipsgrave Tower twice a year, performed by devoted clerics of the Bitch Queen. During the ceremony, Umberlants descended to the temples own sea-slime-covered dock, kept private mostly by the locals fears of angering the goddess. Clerics carried the long-dead body of someone perished at sea and consumed by decomposition. It was tied to a chair and submerged in water to the clergys hymn-singing.\nThere was a widespread belief that Umberlee herself would throw lightning bolts from the top of the Shipsgrave Tower at those who displeased her, and none ever dared to interfere with the churchs rituals. However, fear of her clergy was just as valid as they all were armed to the teeth and were known for a pirates rage.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the ex-pirate Umberlant clergy was led by Wavelord Darjast Sumden."
