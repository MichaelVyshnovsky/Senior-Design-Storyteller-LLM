Efreeti palazzos were the homes of noble efreeti and their slaves. These buildings served as both a palace and stronghold.
Most efreeti palazzos were located within the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.
The household of an efreeti palazzo contained the ruling noble efreeti, common efreet, jann and other slaves. Often a stable was also present which housed nightmares, hell hounds, and fire falcons.
