        "History": "During theÂ [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the walking statue appeared and rampaged through the city. When stopped, the statue bowed to those who had battled it. The statue then sheathed its sword and removed its shield, placing it into the ground, upright, by his side.",
        "Description": "His final pose was that of a guard at ease, facing towards the harbor. This statue was viewed respectfully by those who resided in the southernmost wards of the city."
