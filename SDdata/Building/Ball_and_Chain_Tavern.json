Did â€¦ did that shadow just move?\"\"Aw, go home. Youre drunk!\"\nThe lower wall of the building was built of cobbled stones, then the upper structure was half-timbered and plastered, with many windows elevated well above the ground level. Inside, the tavern had a single large high-ceilinged taproom, with the windows casting light into it from above. The tavern also had a garret upstairs that was used for private meetings, and extra tables out front for those who preferred to drink under the open sky.\n300px|thumb|Where else was there to go in Wheloon?\nThe tavern was set up by Trosken Adze and his wife Alda after the establishment of the prison, and it remained the only drinking hole in the docks. It mainly served the Purple Dragons, War Wizards, magistrates, dockworkers, and other visitors who came to the dismal harbor, and was essentially the only place that they could relax and get away from the horrors of the prison, if only for a little while.\n300px|thumb|The adventurers argue, eat, drink, and plot their next move.\nIn the mid-1480s DR, around the time of the Shadovar invasion of Wheloon, the following folk could be found at the Ball and Chain\n* Trosken and Alda Adze, the owners and operators.\n* Betta Feen, the barmaid.\n* Randall Lyric, a planeswalking aasimar tourist.\n* Maribe Banro, a priest of Amaunator who offered healing to travelers.\n* An adventuring company made up of Gorli, Bash, Irwynne, and Marbone the Cosh.\n* The lizardman Salak, who made deals with the magistrates.\n* The adventurous noble Oriphaun Huntsilver, before he entered the prison.\n* The sage Elminster, who met at various points a disgraced Purple Dragon knight, a renegade Netherese shadar-kai, and a sun elf cleric of Amaunator in the garret to give them guidance."
