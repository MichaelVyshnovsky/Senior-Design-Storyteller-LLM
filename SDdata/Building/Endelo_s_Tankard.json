Its patrons were mainly impoverished sailors who couldnt afford to carouse in more lively establishments.\nThe tavern was located on the west side of Fishleap Lane within the Harbor District.\nThe dilapidated wooden bar had the atmosphere and accommodations of a set of abandoned ruins. It offered watery beer that could be conveniently evacuated into the bucket that was kept as a privy."
