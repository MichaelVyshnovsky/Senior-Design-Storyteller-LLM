The interior included hallways and a kitchen.\nSacrifices to appease Kossuth were performed by feeding animals and slaves to the temples fires.\nAs of , the temple was the most important house of the Kossuthan faith in Thay if not all of Faer√ªn. This changed when it burned down sometime in or shortly before , leaving the Flaming Brazier in Bezantur to claim the title of largest and most prestigious Kossuthan temple.\nWhile the destruction of a Kossuthan temple by fire was commonly understood to be not merely a sign of Kossuths displeasure but an invitation to rebuild bigger and better, the Burning Houses high priest&mdashEternal Flame Klanak Famouth&mdashabandoned the rebuilding efforts to his juniors so that he could seek revenge on the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier, Mythalanir, whom he blamed for his temples destruction.\nThe temple was home to Kossuthan priests and their slaves, who did menial labor within the temple and were used as sacrifices.\nNotable inhabitants included\n* Klanak Famouth, the Eternal Flame of the temple (i.e., leader and high priest) from the mid&ndash through the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n* Mythalanir, who had been born as a slave within the kitchens before joining the priesthood and ascending to the rank of Numinous Blaze before departing the temple."
