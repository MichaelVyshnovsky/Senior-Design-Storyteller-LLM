        "mainbody": "The '''Burning House of Kossuth''', also known simply as the '''Burning House''', was the preeminent temple of [[Kossuth]] in [[Thay]] until its destruction in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located in the heart of the city of [[Tyraturos]], where it was said the dry plains appealed to the [[Fire domain|fire]] [[god]] Kossuth.",
        "Structure": "The temple was open to the sky and surrounded by fires that were always kept burning. The interior included hallways and a kitchen.",
        "Activities": "Sacrifices to appease Kossuth were performed by feeding [[animal]]s and [[slave]]s to the temple's fires.",
        "History": "As of {{Yearlink|1357}}, the temple was the most important house of the [[Church of Kossuth|Kossuthan faith]] in Thay if not all of [[Faer√ªn]]. This changed when it burned down sometime in or shortly before {{Yearlink|1370}}, leaving the [[Flaming Brazier]] in [[Bezantur]] to claim the title of largest and most prestigious Kossuthan temple.\n\nWhile the destruction of a Kossuthan temple by fire was commonly understood to be not merely a sign of Kossuth's displeasure but an invitation to rebuild bigger and better, the Burning House's high priest&mdash;[[Eternal Flame]] [[Klanak Famouth]]&mdash;abandoned the rebuilding efforts to his juniors so that he could seek revenge on the Eternal Flame of the Flaming Brazier, [[Mythalanir]], whom he blamed for his temple's destruction.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple was home to Kossuthan priests and their slaves, who did menial labor within the temple and were used as sacrifices.\n\nNotable inhabitants included:\n* [[Klanak Famouth]], the Eternal Flame of the temple (''i.e.'', leader and high priest) from the mid&ndash; through the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Mythalanir]], who had been born as a slave within the kitchens before joining the priesthood and ascending to the rank of Numinous Blaze before departing the temple."
