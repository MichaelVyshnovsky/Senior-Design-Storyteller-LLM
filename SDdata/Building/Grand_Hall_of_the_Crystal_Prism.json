        "mainbody": "he Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism was a central zone in the Tomb of Martek, linking the Garden of the Cursed with the Inner Sanctum.\nPast the doors in the Garden of the Cursed, there were a thousand more doors, totaling a thousand and one, at fifteen-foot intervals the total path was close to  long. All were opened as soon as the first one was, leading into the Grand Hall proper the final doors into the Grand Hall were a set of four, with two double doors on the center of a wall and two golden doors away from the center.\nThe Grand Hall itself was an octagonal room. Its four long sides each held four doors, symmetrical with the entrance. There were four pits, each 100 feet deep, from which jets of fire rose into the domed ceiling. The pits separated the room between a walkway around the walls, and another four walkways that joined in a  platform in the center, on which a  blue glass platform provided access to the lower level, the Grand Cathedral. A metal structure, like a tent, hung from the ceiling an iron phoenix roosted there.\nPlacing at least  on the blue glass platform at the center made it descend  towards a cathedral of crystal, brilliantly lit from within. The arrival point was an hexagonal room,  across, about  from the southern corner. The center of the room held a platform with stairs from all sides, on which rested a miniature of the Citadel of Martek, except for three missing minarets. There were six archways on the corners of the room, three of which were darkened and three of which were lit. The three lit ones, north, northwest and southeast, matched the missing minarets on the model.\nEach archway proceeded for 300 feet into hexagonal rooms  across. Passages from these rooms formed a larger hexagon around the entry room in the  middle of each passageway was another  room. These rooms in turn were connected each towards a similar room closer to the center, and another further still. The rooms along the passageway contained crystal balls showing a preview of the trial the trial could be accessed from a teleporter in the corresponding room closer to the center, and those who completed the trial would be returned to the Citadel on the further rooms. Both teleporters were platforms raised  off the ground.\nThe crystal balls each showed scenes of a crystal minaret in different surroundings each crystal minaret had to be returned from their location before the Inner Sanctum of Martek became accessible. The minarets were, before Marteks resurrection in , in the Desert of Al-Alisk, the demiplane known as the Black Abyss, and the Mobius Tower.\nThe Grand Hall was empty save for an iron phoenix. It would threaten, but not actually harm, anyone who walked along a narrow 10-foot path between the double doors and the center platform. It would also kill anyone who stepped outside that path for any reason."
