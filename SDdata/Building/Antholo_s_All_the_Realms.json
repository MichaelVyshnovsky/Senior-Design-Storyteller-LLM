        "mainbody": "ntholos All the Realms was a map and chart shop in Delzimmer, southeast Faerûn, owned by Antholo Kraul circa the .\nAntholos was located on Riuntle Street in Delzimmer, a crossroads town (before the ) located between the Great Rift, the Eastern Shaar, Luiren, and the Forest of Amtar.\nThe shop was an unremarkable store front among many on Riuntle Street.\nThe maps and charts at Antholos sold for 25 to 200 gold pieces. The more expensive ones were larger, newer, and/or in demand, but all were much more practical than decorative—showing the essential elements without much cluttering detail. Examples of his wares included copies of trade charts from Calimshan, Tharsult, and the Tashalar, which were themselves mostly copied from more authoritative originals kept in monasteries, royal libraries, and Candlekeep.\nAntholos All the Realms closed sometime in late 1371 or early 1372 DR when Antholo Kraul died while walking by a three-story residence that mysteriously collapsed upon him and a few others, fatally crushing them. Three of his female cousins closed the shop and were in a petty argument over the division of his wares when Kraul walked into his shop like nothing was amiss, a scant few days after his identified body had been burned on a funeral pyre. This same scenario was repeated many times over the next few months, which made Kraul somewhat notorious about town, and his shop benefited from that notoriety."
