The '''Laughing Beholder''', also known as the '''Happy Beholder''', was a tavern on the [[Rock of Bral]] owned and managed by the famous [[beholder]] [[Large Luigi]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} [[DR]].
{{quote|Bralian ale is the best in the Known Spheres... 'Course, it's not Bralian, but then I suppose nothing is. Best part o' living in Wildspace is choosing from the very finest groundling lagers. And I'm sure we're all appreciative of somebody's care in their brewing.|One spacer regular on the selection of drinks in the Laughing Beholder and beyond.}}

==Location==
The tavern stood in the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]] part of [[Bral]], near the Docks. It lay in the heart of a wedge-shaped block of buildings neighboring [[Shou-town (Bral)|Shou-town]], defined by Dock Street, Dragon Street, and Eel Street. It stood behind the [[Griffon Company]] headquarters.<ref>

==Description==
[[File:Commodore Krux.png|thumb|right|250px|''Polly want a drink? Commodore Krux with Luigi's pet parrot.'']]
It was a small yet flourishing establishment.

==Defenses==
Thanks to Large Luigi's great magical powers, namely ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', and ''[[sleep]]'', trouble in the Laughing Beholder was stopped almost as soon as it started. In any case, thugs and thieves rarely started something here.

==Services==
Thanks to the beholder's many eyes, Large Luigi hardly ever missed an order. He used his ''[[telekinesis]]'' eye ray to mix his drinks and to deliver them through the air direct to a patron.

==History==
Large Luigi bought the bar some time after he arrived on the Rock of Bral, having hitched a ride on a [[human]] [[tradesman]] from [[H'Catha]] after he achieved enlightenment and had to flee his fellow beholders.

The [[giff]] Commodore Krux of the ''Second Wind'' met a group of adventurers in the Happy Beholder to recruit them to fight against the [[astral elf|astral elves]] of the Xaryxian Empire.
