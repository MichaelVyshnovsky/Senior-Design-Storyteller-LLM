        "mainbody": "The '''Wyvern Ferry Route''', or simply the '''Wyvern Ferry''', was a ferry across the [[Wyvernflow River]] in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. It linked the [[Way of the Manticore]] over the river.\n\nWheloon was originally a small [[thorp]] that lived off the trade of river crossings on the Wyvern Ferry. It slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and grew into a town based around the ferry.\n\nWith heavy traffic and many Whelunians owning boats, fares remained cheap. For a one-way trip, the fare was 1 [[copper piece]] per person, mount or pack animal, cart or wagon, and baggage that could not be carried in hand. The ferries ran day and night."
