        "mainbody": "he Wyvern Ferry Route, or simply the Wyvern Ferry, was a ferry across the Wyvernflow River in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. It linked the Way of the Manticore over the river.\nWheloon was originally a small thorp that lived off the trade of river crossings on the Wyvern Ferry. It slowly developed as trade along the Way of the Manticore increased and grew into a town based around the ferry.\nWith heavy traffic and many Whelunians owning boats, fares remained cheap. For a one-way trip, the fare was 1 copper piece per person, mount or pack animal, cart or wagon, and baggage that could not be carried in hand. The ferries ran day and night."
