        "mainbody": "The '''Broken Dagger''' was a stinking watering hole in the southern part of [[Dagger Falls]] in [[Daggerdale]].",
        "Structure": "The main building of the Dagger was a burnt-out shell. To enter the tavern, customers passed under a sign painted with two broken halves of a weapon and descended old cellar stairs into a dirt covered room, lit by lanterns, and a row of beer kegs acting as the bar. There was a wide, sloped, comfortable leaning rail all around the walls to keep the filthy inhabitants from dirtying the painting of naked men and women wrestling, which circled the three of the walls of the taproom. Another set of stairs exited out behind the bar for breaking up fights or escorting drunks out into the street.",
        "History": "In [[1336 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] took control of Daggerdale and Dagger Falls fell under Zhent rule.  Around [[1367 DR]], the tavern was frequented by Black Network soldiers and their [[orc]] allies. Around this time, a retired Zhentish [[fighter]], [[Tharwin One-eye]], owned the taphouse and turned it into a wild and dangerous bar. It was during Tharwin's reign of the Broken Dagger armed [[hobgoblin]]s used metal [[club]]s to clear out drunken customers or break up fights. Around [[1369 DR]], [[Randal Morn]] reclaimed Daggerdale from the grasp of [[Zhentil Keep]] and restored order to the dale. At this time, the [[half-ogre]], [[Dynter]], turned the falling apart building from an [[orc]] brawling pit into a preferred place for adventurers to have a drink.",
        "Inhabitants": "Under Dynter's ownership, patrons laughed and drank and did not constantly look over their shoulders expecting the flash of a [[dagger]] or the gleam of a iron cudgel. Dynter was aided by five bulky [[human]] [[warrior]]s, who once were members of the raiding organization known as the [[Tesh Tusks]].",
