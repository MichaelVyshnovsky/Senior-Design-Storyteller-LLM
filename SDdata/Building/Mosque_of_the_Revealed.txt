The Mosque of the Revealed was a mosque dedicated to Najm in Liham, in 1367 DR.
Many citizens from Liham came to the mosque to blow off steam, verbally venting their frustration with any number of issues. This was usually a peaceful occurrence, but riots spawned from heated arguments once in a while.
The priests of the mosque were pragmatists or ethoists.
