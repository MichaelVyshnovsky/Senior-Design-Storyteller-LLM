The '''Mosque of the Revealed''' was a mosque dedicated to [[Najm]] in [[Liham]], in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Inhabitants==
Many citizens from Liham came to the mosque to blow off steam, verbally venting their frustration with any number of issues. This was usually a peaceful occurrence, but riots spawned from heated arguments once in a while.

The priests of the mosque were [[pragmatist]]s or [[ethoist]]s.
