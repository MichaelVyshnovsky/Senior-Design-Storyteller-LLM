        "mainbody": "The '''Weary Giant''' was an inn, tavern, and orphanage in [[Stagwick]], [[Hartsvale]], known for being the home of the adventurers [[Tavis Burdun]] and [[Avner]] of [[Hartwick]].",
        "Description": "The inn was large enough inside for even a [[fire giant]] to dance upon its stage, and in fact, such performances were often held there, It also had a stable.\n\nThe inn served [[elderberry]] [[tart]]s, a delicious dessert.",
        "History": "The inn was once owned by a woman named [[Isa Wirr]], who raised Tavis and other orphans whom she allowed to live there. When Isa died, she passed the inn on to Tavis, and he became its proprietor.\n\nIn [[1366 DR]], after a performance in which both Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and Lord Mayor [[Ruther Dobbin]] were in attendance, the book thief [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] hid in the stable, but he was hidden by the orphan Avner.\n\nAlso, that same night, Brianna was abducted by [[Ice Spire ogre|ogres]] on her way home from the inn to [[Castle Hartwick]] along [[Coggin's Rise]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century, ownership of the inn had been taken over by Tavis's son [[Wum Burdun]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|18}}"
