        "mainbody": "The Weary Giant was an inn, tavern, and orphanage in Stagwick, Hartsvale, known for being the home of the adventurers Tavis Burdun and Avner of Hartwick.\nThe inn was large enough inside for even a fire giant to dance upon its stage, and in fact, such performances were often held there, It also had a stable.\nThe inn served elderberry tarts, a delicious dessert.\nThe inn was once owned by a woman named Isa Wirr, who raised Tavis and other orphans whom she allowed to live there. When Isa died, she passed the inn on to Tavis, and he became its proprietor.\nIn 1366 DR, after a performance in which both Princess Brianna and Lord Mayor Ruther Dobbin were in attendance, the book thief Basil hid in the stable, but he was hidden by the orphan Avner.\nAlso, that same night, Brianna was abducted by ogres on her way home from the inn to Castle Hartwick along Coggins Rise.\nBy the late 15 century, ownership of the inn had been taken over by Taviss son Wum Burdun."
