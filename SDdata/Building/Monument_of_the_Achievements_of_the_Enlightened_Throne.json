        "mainbody": "he Monument of the Achievements of the Enlightened Throne was a tower located within the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThis splendid tower housed halls honoring the Grand Caliphs of Zakharas past.\nGrand Caliph Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir commissioned this extravagant project to honor his forebears. A special group of dwarves and ogres, led by a skilled architect genie, were used to build the structure. Artists were used to decorate the walls with historic scenes of the various accomplishments of the Grand Caliphs. Naturally, the current Grand Caliph gave more attention to his fathers and grandfathers deeds.\nThe project was still under construction as of 1367 DR with the hopes that it would be completed for the Grand Caliphs next Ascension Day."
