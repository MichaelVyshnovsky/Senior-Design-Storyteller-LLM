'''Symbril's House''' was an inn in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

With high quality for moderate prices, it was a cozy little place in the city's High District. It stood close to Maiden's Leap, and both overlooked and opened into the Garden.

As Lord [[Dhelt]] decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Symbril's House was expressly an inn.
