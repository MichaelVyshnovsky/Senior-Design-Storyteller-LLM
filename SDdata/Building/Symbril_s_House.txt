Symbrils House was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
With high quality for moderate prices, it was a cozy little place in the citys High District. It stood close to Maidens Leap, and both overlooked and opened into the Garden.
As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Symbrils House was expressly an inn.
