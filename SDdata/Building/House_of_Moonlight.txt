The House of Moonlight was a temple to Sel√ªne the Moonmaiden found in the city of Tantras in the Vast.
The House of Moonlight lay on the far east side of the city.
During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the deity Torm resided at his temple in Tantras. Torms zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths in the city as "unbelievers". It is not known if or how the House of Moonlight was affected by this religious persecution.
Nevertheless, the House of Moonlight remained active through to 1367 DR and past 1370 DR.
Around 1358 DR, the temple provided healing to all who required it, even those who did not worship the goddess. However, they would not accede to repeated requests.
In 1358 DR, the temple was led by High Priest Pellar Thalangrim, with nine priests and sixteen lay-followers.
