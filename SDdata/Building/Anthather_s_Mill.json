The land around it was largely farmlands, broken up by large stones.\nThe building was made of fieldstone, and had a pool where the stream that turned its wheel was dammed. The pool continued along one of the roads.\nFlour was made there.\nA Chosen of Mystra, Elminster Aumar, asked for directions at Anthathers Mill when looking for the Riven Stone, learning it was just down the road from there."
