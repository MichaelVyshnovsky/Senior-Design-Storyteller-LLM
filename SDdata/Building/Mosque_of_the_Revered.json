        "Description": "The facade of the mosque was slightly worn and faded, despite its prestigious location near the [[Ivory Palace]].",
        "Activities": "In [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} the mosque was supported almost entirely by donations from visitors from the [[Cities of the Pantheon]]. Kor did not have a strong following in Dihliz when compared to [[Selan]], meaning the mosque often fell into financial hardship. Because of this, priests of Kor would bestow their spells on anyone making a sizable donation without hesitation or questioning their motives."
