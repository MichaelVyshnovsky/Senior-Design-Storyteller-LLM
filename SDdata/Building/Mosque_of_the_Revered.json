        "mainbody": "The Mosque of the Revered was a temple in Dihliz dedicated to the worship of Kor in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe facade of the mosque was slightly worn and faded, despite its prestigious location near the Ivory Palace.\nIn 1367 DR the mosque was supported almost entirely by donations from visitors from the Cities of the Pantheon. Kor did not have a strong following in Dihliz when compared to Selan, meaning the mosque often fell into financial hardship. Because of this, priests of Kor would bestow their spells on anyone making a sizable donation without hesitation or questioning their motives."
