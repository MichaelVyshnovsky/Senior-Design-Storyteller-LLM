The '''Temple of Yarom''' was a temple in [[Telflamm]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, [[Chun (Telflamm)|Chun]] of the [[Nine Golden Swords]] ordered [[Raidon Kane]] to slay everyone in the Temple of Yarom so as to prove his intent to join the organization. Per Chun, the temple preached salvation which lay beyond life and the gods, doubting even their divinity.{{cite book/Stardeep|35|4}}
