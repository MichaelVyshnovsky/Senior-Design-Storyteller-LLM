        "mainbody": "undbridge was a massive, squat bridge located about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Waterdeep, where the Trade Way crossed the Dessarin River. The bridge was named after the wizard Zund, who created it. As of 1370 DR, the bridge had held firm without repairs for more than ninety winters.\nWaterdeep maintained a castle there on a rocky outcropping above the river gorge. The castles outer wall protected a large area used to inspect caravans while the inner wall protected garrison buildings. The castle had three griffons at its disposal.\nZund was said to have used a stone golem to build the bridge, and over the years many sought to find it and command it."
