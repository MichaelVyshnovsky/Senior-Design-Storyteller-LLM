Farrels Fine Jewelry and Apparel was a high-end outset shop located in the town of Daggerford during the 14 century DR. It was run by Farrel, a representative of a Waterdhavian trade consortium.
The shop was located in Daggerfords Money Quarter in central Daggerford along the Hill Road.
The shop offered high quality textiles such as silk and furs that were imported from far away realms. Farrel was always looking to buy unique pieces of jewelry, either mundane or magical in nature, and sell them for exorbitant prices.
