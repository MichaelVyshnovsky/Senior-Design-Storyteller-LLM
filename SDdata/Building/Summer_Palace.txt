The '''Summer Palace''' was the second home of Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] of [[Evermeet]].

It lay in the center of the [[Lake of Dreams]]. The palace itself rivaled the [[Moonstone Palace]] for beauty and was an enchanted structure of alabaster, marble, crystal, and gems resting on four pyramids that floated 200 feet (60 meters) above the lake.

The queen used this location to consider important issues with her [[Council of Matrons]].<ref>
