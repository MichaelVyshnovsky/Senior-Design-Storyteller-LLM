        "mainbody": "lmhazans Jewels was a jewelry shop in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe shop was located on the west side of the High Road, across from the the entrance to Spendthrift Alley.\nThe shops façade was made of silvered polished stone and was shaped like an enormous faceted gemstone. This aesthetic choice was commonly mocked by the Waterdhavian nobility.\nThe inside of the shop was lined with displays showing an enormous variety of nonmagical gemstones. The display stands were decorated with beljuril shards that made them continuously sparkle.\nAlmost all varieries of gems could be found for sale at Olmhazans Jewels, save for magical gems and extremely rare ones, such as amaratha, kings tears, and rogue stones. Prices were slightly higher than typical market values, usually adding between 15 and 25 gp to each stones value.\nThe shop was defended by two trained mimics that disguised themselves as a display stand and part of the front entrance and gem façade. It was uncommon for thieves to steal from the shop since one such attempt had resulted in the thief being partially devoured by one of the mimics.\nIn the mid‒14 century DR, the shop was owned and operated by Jhauntar Olmhazan, who also held the position of Gentleman Speaker at Waterdeeps Jewelers Guild. Jhauntar was dismissive of all country folk and regarded the inhabitants of the eastern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars as barbarians."
