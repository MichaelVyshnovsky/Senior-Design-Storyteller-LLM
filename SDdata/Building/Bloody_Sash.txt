The Bloody Sash was a temple dedicated to Ilmater located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 century DR.
The temple, and Ilmaters worship in general, was unpopular in Yeshpek as the clergy preached that the goods produced within the city should be made as cheaply as possible to lower prices and increase affordability. Their teaching fell mostly on deaf ears.
The Bloody Sash was run by Reverend Mother Hervanda Suulrath.
