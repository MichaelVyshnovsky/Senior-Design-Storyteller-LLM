The '''Courtyard of Lolth''' was a temple dedicated to [[Lolth]] in [[Maerimydra]] and was destroyed during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Location==
Located on the noble plateau above the rest of [[Maerimydra]], the Courtyard of Lolth was reached from the city proper by ascending a great sweeping staircase at the end of the [[Grand Boulevard (Maerimydra)|Grand Boulevard]].

==Structure==
===Exterior===
The Courtyard of Lolth was constructed in the semblance of an enormous [[spider]] with an elegantly sculpted archway forming the stony fangs of the building. Each wall was adorned with designs of alien and distorted spiders.

===Interior===
Inside the Courtyard of Lolth, the temple was formed of numerous rooms and its entrance was flanked by orbs of glowing, pale, blue-green [[magic]]al light.

After the temple's destruction in [[1372 DR]], the interior of the Courtyard of Lolth was nothing more than a blasted ruin, with a blackened crater at its center.

==Defenses==
Merely passing through the archway of the Courtyard of Lolth rendered all [[invisible]] creatures visible. This was an ''[[invisbility purge]]'' effect that emanated from the glowing orbs in the archway.

==History==
In {{Yearlink|-331}}, the [[drow]] of [[Maerimydra]] stole the ''[[Warblade]]'' from Lord [[Orym Hawksong]] and ferried it from the [[Twisted Tower]] in [[Shadowdale]] to a secret vault beneath the Courtyard of Lolth.

In [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]], the Courtyard of Lolth was stormed by [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] and his army. Kurgoth's forces looted the majority of the temple's vaults. The [[cleric]]s of [[Lolth]] that guarded the temple quickly fell without access to their [[spell]]s. Shortly after this, [[Irae T'sarran]] managed to completely destroy the interior building of the temple with incredibly powerful magic that lingered for a full six days afterwards. 

The lingering [[negative energy]] that suffused the temple drew a powerful [[nightshade]], known as a [[nightwalker]], to the temple. The creature laired in the shadows near the central crater.

At some point in [[1373 DR]], after the Silence of Lolth had ended, members of [[House Dhuurniv]] tried to resettle Maerimydra, but after a few failed attempts they returned to the [[Skull Subterranes]] beneath [[Twisted Tower|Azmaer's Folly]]. Despite their failure, they still managed to recover the [[Warblade|Ary'Velahar'Kerym]] from the secret vault beneath the Courtyard of Lolth.
