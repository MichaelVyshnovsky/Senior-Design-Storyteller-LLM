        "mainbody": "he Temple of the Delicate Chaos was a secret temple of Cyric hidden underground beneath the city of Innarlith.\nThe design of the temple was based in chaos. The temple itself was a large circular hall about  in diameter. The floor was made of rough flagstone that seemed like it was floating on something when people stepped on it, the tiles shifted and waves travelled across the floor. The walls were covered in tiles, but they were of different sizes and had colours that didnt match, and were arranged without a coherent pattern. It had torches set in iron sconces on the walls that provided dim lighting. However, the torches were not set at even intervals, and this created areas on the floor that were either light or dark.\nA spiral staircase led about 100 feet back up to the street.\nA number of reptilian and insectoid monsters were in the temple under the command of the Cyricist clergy.\n* Wenefir"
