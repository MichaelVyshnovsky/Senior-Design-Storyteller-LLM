'''The Four Stags''' was a bustling 14{{th}} century [[DR]] inn on the northern end of the [[Bowshot (Border Kingdoms)|Bowshot]] road, where it met the [[Longcrag Ride]], in the untamed lands of [[Owlhold]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]].

==Interior==
The common room of the Four Stags was warmed by two blazing hearts on the opposite sides. The inn offered rental "long stalls" that could fit an entire caravan. Travelers could leave the wagons, goods, and beasts of burden there overnight. The stalls were long wooden hallways that allowed caravans in on one end, and when the time came, wagons moved forward and exited on the other side.

===Atmosphere===
The inn was a busy place, always filled with the Owlen folks who sought to meet or trade with travelers, merchants, and other wayfarers.

==Services==
The Stags was a good quality inn that charged appropriately high [[coin]] for the lodgings as well as food and drink. This establishment was one of the very few places where locals traveled in order to buy, sell, or fraternize with outsiders.
