The '''Leaning Lance''' was a [[tavern]] located in the city of [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
The Leaning Lance was open round the clock and catered to sailors who often usually only had enough coin for drinks. The sailors often slept the night away wherever they were tossed into the alley when their coin ran dry.
