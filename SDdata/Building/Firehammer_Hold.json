        "mainbody": "irehammer Hold was a temple-fortress dedicated to Haela Brightaxe, a dwarf hero-goddess purported to grant luck in battle, located in the Forlorn Hills of northwest Faer√ªn.\nThe temple was found within a tunnel complex beneath the eastern end of the northernmost hills of the Forlorn Hills, known as the Watchers of the North.\nFirehammer Hold suffered a long and gradual reduction in its numbers of staff and residents to the point that the remaining dwarves there decided that they could no longer effectively defend themselves from threats. Shortly after the founding of Delimbiyran, rumors were deliberately spread that a deadly plague had befallen the fortress in the hope that fear of infection would ward off potential foes.\nAlthough reduced in number over the years, Haelas faithful maintained control of the hold up until Thayan wizards planned to capture the region in the late 15 century DR. With Baazka the pit fiend as an intermediary, the Red Wizards of Thay made a pact with a duergar clan leader named Nalifarn and asked him to invade Firehammer Hold and seize its forges. The gray dwarves dug a passage from the Underdark into the lower levels of the hold and attacked, assisted by elemental creatures summoned by the Red Wizards. Taking Haelas followers by surprise, the battle was fierce but brief none of the faithful survived. Once in charge of the fortress, allies of the duergar, especially hobgoblins, scoured the countryside for people to kidnap and enslave for work in the mines around the hold.\n* Shrine to Haela Brightaxe\n* Shrine to Dumathoin\n* Cenotaph\n* Chapel of the Watcher"
