        "mainbody": "'''Firehammer Hold''' was a temple-fortress dedicated to [[Haela Brightaxe]], a dwarf hero-goddess purported to grant luck in battle, located in the [[Forlorn Hills]] of [[northwest Faer√ªn]].",
        "Location": "The temple was found within a tunnel complex beneath the eastern end of the northernmost hills of the Forlorn Hills, known as the '''Watchers of the North'''.",
        "History": "Firehammer Hold suffered a long and gradual reduction in it's numbers of staff and residents to the point that the remaining dwarves there decided that they could no longer effectively defend themselves from threats. Shortly after the founding of [[Delimbiyran]], rumors were deliberately spread that a deadly plague had befallen the fortress in the hope that fear of infection would ward off potential foes.\n\nAlthough reduced in number over the years, Haela's faithful maintained control of the hold up until [[Thay]]an wizards planned to capture the region in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. With [[Baazka]] the [[pit fiend]] as an intermediary, the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] made a pact with a [[duergar]] clan leader named [[Nalifarn]] and asked him to invade Firehammer Hold and seize its forges. The gray dwarves dug a passage from the [[Underdark]] into the lower levels of the hold and attacked, assisted by [[elemental]] creatures summoned by the Red Wizards. Taking Haela's followers by surprise, the battle was fierce but brief; none of the faithful survived. Once in charge of the fortress, allies of the duergar, especially [[hobgoblin]]s, scoured the countryside for people to kidnap and enslave for work in the mines around the hold.",
