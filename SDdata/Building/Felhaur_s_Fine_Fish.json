        "mainbody": "Felhaurs Fine Fish was a fish store in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis store stood along Spices Street, a few doors down from Khostal Hannass, Fine Nuts.\nFelhaurs sold a wide variety of seafood. In addition to the scaled and finned \"ordinary\" varieties of fish, such as silverfins, one could purchase eels, octopuses, sea cucumbers, shellfish, squids, and whelks. These seafood were all kept within shallow metal displays, atop counters that gently sloped towards the customers. Within these shallow displays they sat atop in water a layer of crushed ice, with smooth flat stones atop them that kept air from getting in.\nThis store was run by the third-generation fishmonger Felhaur and his six children. Felhaurs wife stayed uninvolved in the business, but handled the pickling and jarring of seaweed and whelks.\nFelhaurs was widely known and trusted all across the Dock Ward.\nThere were persistent rumors that the proprietor of this establishment was involved in smuggling, leading the City Watch to actively monitor the place. While Felhaurs was frequently used by smugglers as a spot for dropping messages, it was not involved in smuggling beyond that. Due to the the attention the Watch had over his establishment, Felhaur would kick out anyone that mentioned smuggling in his store."
