        "mainbody": "Tsathrees Comforts was a boutique owned by Jhamanthra Tsathree.\nTsathrees Comforts was located on Golden Serpent Street in the North Ward of Waterdeep circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.\nThis shop gained brief notoriety when Jhamanthra began selling a new scented facial wash she called Waterfall Kiss. It was quickly discovered that skin treated with this product suddenly began to glow a vivid green color a few hours after applying certain cosmetic products to the treated area. The glow lasted for a few hours and then faded, apparently harmlessly. For a time, Waterfall Kiss was in great demand as the Waterdhavian youth with disposable income experimented with the humorous and glamorous application of making other body parts glow.\nCategoryShops\nCategoryBeauty shops\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryLocations on Golden Serpent Street\nCategoryLocations in the North Ward of Waterdeep\nCategoryLocations in Waterdeep\nCategoryLocations on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n5zsqei3nmldnvrwfb9lx8iczn8jo7nx"
