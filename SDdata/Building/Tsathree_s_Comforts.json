        "Location": "Tsathree's Comforts was located on [[Golden Serpent Street]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep]] circa the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]].",
        "History": "This shop gained brief notoriety when Jhamanthra began selling a new scented facial wash she called [[Waterfall Kiss]]. It was quickly discovered that skin treated with this product suddenly began to glow a vivid green color a few hours after applying certain cosmetic products to the treated area. The glow lasted for a few hours and then faded, apparently harmlessly. For a time, Waterfall Kiss was in great demand as the Waterdhavian youth with disposable income experimented with the humorous and glamorous application of making other body parts glow.",
