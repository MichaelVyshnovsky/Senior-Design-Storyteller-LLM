        "Activities": "The temple was overseen by Watchful Skull [[Tynnos Argrim]], founder of the order of [[assassin]]s known as the [[Flames of the Dark Sun]].",
        "History": "The temple was once dedicated to the god [[Bane]], before being claimed by Cyricists during the [[Banedeath#Legacy|Amnian Banedeath]] in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}.\n\nIn the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Watchful Skull Argrim slew the leader of the [[Dark Redoubt]] within the temple's premises and forced its clergy to fall under his own leadership.\n\nThe Mountain of Skulls endured the decades of languish experienced by the Cyricist faith, and remained standing as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}."
