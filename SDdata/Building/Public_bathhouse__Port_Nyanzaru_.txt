The public bathhouse of Port Nyanzaru, sometimes referred to simply as "the Bathhouse", was a place where people of all social classes could mingle and bathe.
It sat in the north of the Market Ward along the ridge overlooking the sea.
The bathhouse comprised marble-floored changing rooms and tiled baths. The shell of a giant clam stood by the entrance, where patrons were asked to leave a donation.
The bathhouse was operated by the citys clergy of Sune, and was free to use. However, guests were encouraged to leave a donation to the Temple of Sune, and were asked to pay according to their means (such that richer residents left larger amounts).
In addition, the bathhouse hosted a number of masseurs and masseuses who offered their services for pay. A massage could cost anywhere from 2 silver pieces to as much as 2 gold pieces.
While Port Nyanzaru boasted dozens of bathhouses as of the late 15 century DR, most operated like exclusive clubs. Only the public bathhouse and the Temple of Sune offered baths available to all. This was of great importance because of the value that the citys residents placed on being clean, and the people were rightly very proud of their magnificent public baths. As a result, even the citys poorest strove to leave at least a copper piece when they visited.
