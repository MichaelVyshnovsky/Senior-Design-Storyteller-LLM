        "Description": "The building was named after the many mirrors and mannequins positioned around its common room.",
        "Besides": "Besides being a tavern, the House of a Thousand Faces was also an inn. A night in the House cost 1 [[Currency|gp]] per guest.",
        "History": "The House of a Thousand Faces was originally a clothing boutique. After the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], the owner, an [[Noble eladrin|eladrin]] named [[Theryis]], closed her business and left the city.\n\nTheryis returned a few years later, alongside her half-brother [[Toram]], both of them now [[Harper agent]]s. She re-purposed her old business as a tavern, to serve as an undercover base for the Harpers operating in the city.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], during the unrest in Neverwinter because of the actions of the \"[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]]\" of [[Alagondar]], a group of [[adventurer]]s had to pacify a group of extremist followers of the \"Lost Heir\", who were purging all of [[Dagult Neverember]]'s loyalist in the Blacklake District, when those extremists attacked them while they were in the tavern."
