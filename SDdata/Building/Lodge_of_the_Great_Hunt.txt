The '''Lodge of the Great Hunt''' was a temple dedicated to [[Malar]] located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located in south Zhentil Keep in the western section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] at the intersection of [[Mace Way]], [[Twilight Street]], and [[Center Street]].

==Description==
The building was elongated and low to the ground. It was made from large tree trunks and had a thatched roof.

==Interior==
Animal pelts and trophies decorated the walls, making the temple resemble a hunting lodge. A roaring fire was kept stoked in the great hearth.

==Activities==
Little existed here in the form of a formal religous service. Instead, Malar's followers prefered to range on great hunts in the wild. Malar's faithful also spent a great deal of time training loyal hunting [[dog]]s, much to the dismay of local [[druid]]s as many of the dogs were taken from the wild as pups.

==Inhabitants==
Huntmaster [[Baerdeth Malagar]] remained the High Priest of the temple as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. He was assisted by 12 [[specialty priest]]s called [[beastheart]]s.

==History==
The building was originally used as the guildhall for the [[Leathercrafters' Guild]], but was taken by Malar's faithful following the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}.
