        "mainbody": "The Windlords Rest was an inn located in Tilverton owned and operated by Thungor Triblane during the 1350sâ€“1360s DR.\nThe inn was originally located in the middle of the Old Town in 1358 DR. It sat just down the street from the Temple of Gond Wondermaker and the home of Filani the Sage. By 1367 DR, its popularity among returning guests was such that Thungor had felt the need for larger premises and moved to a new location a few streets away. The Windlord then sat in the southernmost tip of Tilverton next to the town walls, just south of Gateguard Road and across the street from Undreir Facilitations. The former location became the Jonstyls Banner rooming house, much to the confusion of returning guests.\nThe original Windlords Rest was a three-story building, with a bar and dining room on the ground floor, three private bedrooms on the second floor, and the third floor consisting of a converted attic with a single large room with six beds.\nAs the place became far too popular for its own size, Thungor moved his business to a larger location, a series of former shops and homes connected by a maze of irregular, drafty passageways. This new layout was extremely confusing for both patrons and staff, but the inn remained quite popular.\nThe inns original location was quite small but cozy, offering fair accommodations and reasonable pricing. Guests were treated as if they were adopted family, with Thungor affectionately dispensing advice, scoldings, pocket money, and slippers as necessary. Although this drove some customers away, the majority came to love it and would return whenever possible, sending deposits ahead and paying extra to ensure they had a place. When the inn was moved to a new, larger location, Thungors warm and familial welcome remained just the same.\nThungor paid for two shy gnomes to stay at Jonstyls Banner, so that they could lead away confused guests who werent aware of the address change."
