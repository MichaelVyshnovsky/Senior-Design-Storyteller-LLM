        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Leira''' was a place of worship dedicated to [[Leira]], the [[goddess]] of lies, located in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]].",
        "Location": "This small temple was located near the waterfront in southeastern Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Myrkul (Bezantur)|Temple of Myrkul]] to the west, temples of [[Temple of Tempus (Bezantur)|Tempus]] and [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Tyr]] to the north, and the [[Temple of Gond (Bezantur)|Temple of Gond]] to the east.",
        "Activities": "The [[priests]] who maintained the temple wore masks to keep their identities anonymous. They were not well-liked in Bezantur because of their reputation for lying constantly. Their hierarchy and leadership&mdash;if indeed they had any&mdash;was not known by the people.",
        "History": "Leira was never widely venerated in Thay&mdash;with the possible exception of [[illusionists]]&mdash;and her temple in Bezantur was not the primary place of her worship in the realm, which was instead centered in [[Eltabbar]]. \n\nAfter the disappearance of Leira following the [[Time of Troubles]], the priests of the temple continued to be granted [[spell]]s. As their goddess was assumed to be dead, it was rumored that some other deity was granting these powers."
