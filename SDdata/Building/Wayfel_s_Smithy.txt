Wayfels Smithy was a lowâ€“quality forge that operated in the Farmers Quarter of Daggerford during the 14 century DR.
The smithy was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford at the junction of Wall Street and Horse Way.
The only thing lower than Wayfels prices was the quality of his work. He did not come close to competing with the fine pieces forged at Dervals Bright Blade.
Some time around the  Wayfel was hired to construct a tower that overlooked Daggerfords River Gate. Unfortunately, he failed to anchor the structure to the solid rock beneath the Delimbiyr River. When the river flooded, the tower collapsed.
Wayfel was not offered any construction contracts after that fiasco.
When referring to the blacksmith Cromach, locals said his work was "as shaky as Wayfels best."
