        "mainbody": "The Queenspire was a temple of Umberlee within Deepwater Harbor in Waterdeep.\nThe building was located on a large rocky outcropping of a sandbar south of the city off the South Ward.\nAfter discovering a magic abalone shell floating in Waterdeep harbor in 1369 DR, Dread High Trident Meritid Archneie took it as a good omen and petitioned the Lords of Waterdeep to allow him to construct a temple to Umberlee in the city. The Lords consented and construction was nearing completion in 1372 DR."
