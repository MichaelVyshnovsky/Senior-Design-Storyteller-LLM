The Dolphin Bridge was one of the three emblematic bridges of Neverwinter.
The bridge was carved in the likeness of a dolphin.
The Dolphin Bridge, alongside the other two bridges, radiated out of Castle Never, connecting it with the rest of the city. In the Dolphins case, it connected the castle with the House of Knowledge.
During the Ruining of 1451 DR, the Dolphin Bridge was destroyed by the cataclysm.
