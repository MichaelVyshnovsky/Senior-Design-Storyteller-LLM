==Location==
Facemaker's Boutique was located on [[Wendserpent Street]],{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} up the street south from [[The Glitter Gala]], just by the [[Manor Gate]] of the [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]], which connected the Lower and [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper Cities]].

==Interior==
The Boutique's entrance was marked with a sign shaped like two thread spools and advertised the establishment's name. Past the main entrance stood the shop's main room with a clerk's counter in the middle, two large window displays of finery and shelves and racks that showed the shop's wide selection of clothes, [[dye]]s, gowns, [[cloak]]s, [[boots]], and hats.

The clerk's counter had two large doors on each side that opened into the Facemaker's workshop, which consisted of three interconnected rooms: the clothier to the left and [[mirror]]-filled hair-styling to the right, and a lavish waiting area in the middle, separated from the two other rooms by red curtains.

The Boutique's second floor was used as living quarters.

==Services==
Facemaker's Boutique offers a wide variety of fanciful clothes for purchase, styling, and custom-tailoring. Additionally, the establishment helped its customers with [[makeup]] and hairstyling, as well as other cosmetic services.

==History==
Facemaker's Boutique once was owned by [[Julio Facemaker]], sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR. After Julio passed, his daughter [[Carmen Facemaker]] received a massive inheritance of [[gold]], [[gem]]s, and [[silk]]s, while the shop and all the hard work and responsibilities were left to his son, [[Figaro Pennygood|Figaro "Facemaker" Pennygood]], because, as the ''last will and testament'' stated, "A bit of honest labor would do him good." However, there were some doubts about the ''last will's'' authenticity due to the presence of a [[forgery kit]] near where the original document was hidden in the Boutique.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], Figaro Pennygood was targeted by the [[Bhaalist]] Unholy Assassin aspirant [[Dolor (assassin)|Dolor]], who went on a spree of grizzly murders collecting lives and hands of the innocent of Baldur's Gate. Figaro was on the list of targets, and subsequently, an attempt on his life took place. Dolor, accompanied by a group of Bhaalist [[doppelganger]]s, [[poison]]ed the dwarf clothier with ''[[Karabasan's gift]]'' and set out to slice his neck open. [[Devella Fountainhead]], a constable of the [[Flaming Fist]], interfered, being attracted by the assault's commotion, but was rendered paralyzed by the same toxin. It was unknown whether Figaro survived the attempt on his life or was slaughtered by the [[Murder Tribunal]].

During the same period of time, Figaro Pennygood posted an ad searching for a cut hair sweeper who had to come with their own [[broom]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Phlanders Hort]] was one of the clerks employed by Master Figaro in the late 15{{th}} century DR, often found at the center of the shop, behind the counter. Another one of his employees was [[Bobula Hanvers]]. The shop also was supplied with gems by [[Omotola]] and her Glitter Gala shop nearby.

Some of the Facemaker's Boutique's customers included [[Hannaah Befling]]; [[Varce Humbletood]], who used the Facemaker's hair cutting and styling services; the [[vampire spawn]] [[Leon]], who served [[Cazador Szarr]]; Master [[Durinbold]], who commissioned formalwear for his wife to attend Lord [[Enver Gortash]]'s coronation; as well as an anonymous client who sought to change his appearance to avoid assassination.
