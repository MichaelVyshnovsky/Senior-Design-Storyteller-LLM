        "mainbody": "The House of Screams was the nearest thing to a city hall or courthouse in the Shadowfell city of Evernight. It was where the citys ruling tribunal held court.\nIt was located in the \"upscale\" neighborhood of Black Mound.\nThe House of Screams was a decrepit, multilevel manor house. It was the oldest and one of the largest such manors in Black Mound, and by extension, in all of Evernight.\nThe upper level of the manor was used by Evernights ruling tribunal of powerful ghouls&mdashits closest thing to a government&mdashto preside over assemblies and moderate disputes. The exits were all reinforced with rusty portcullises that were lowered during trials to prevent the guilty party from fleeing their sentence being eaten by the tribunal.\nThe cellar of the House of Screams was large and open, and served as a site for residents of Evernight to resolve their disputes without involving the tribunal. In other words, it was an arena where the parties battled to the death. To the extent that these fights had formal rules and procedures, witnesses had to attest that the parties abided by them. Such witnesses often included bored ghouls, wights, and vampires who loitered in the cellar hoping to watch a fight."
