The Hooked Knucklehead was a longstanding inn in Bryn Shander.
The inn was located near the marketplace in the center of town.
The Hooked Knucklehead was mostly frequented by traders from neighboring cities who came to Bryn Shander for business. The owner, Barton, did not interfere with his clients affairs.
The few private rooms available did not have any hearths, and were freezing cold at night, also due to the buildings lack of structure to withstand the cold winds. Most customers slept in the large common room close to its stone fireplace.
