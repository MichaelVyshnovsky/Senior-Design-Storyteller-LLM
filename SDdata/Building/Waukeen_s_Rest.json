        "Location": "The inn was situated along the [[Risen Road]] approximately equidistant between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Elturel]].\n\nBeneath the inn was a cave network that extended deep underground, which were used as a [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|hideout]] by [[Zhentarim]] smugglers.",
        "Structure": "Waukeen's Rest comprised a central stone building, with two wings that extended forward from either side. They were decorated with arched windows and topped with barrel-tile roofs. A gated archway decorated with a relief of [[Waukeen]] welcomed visitors and a pair of barns around the back offered accommodations for any mounts or pack animals.",

        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Grand Duke]] [[Ulder Ravengard]] and some of his [[Flaming Fist]] soldiers stopped at the inn, after his escape from the [[Elturel]] when it was pulled down into the [[Nine Hells]]. His group was ambushed by members of the [[cult of the Absolute]] and Waukeen's Rest was set ablaze. Several guests of the inn were killed in the raid, alongside some of the cultists and soldiers of the Fist."
