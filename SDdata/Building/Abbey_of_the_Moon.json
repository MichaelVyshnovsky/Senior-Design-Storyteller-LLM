        "History": "This abbey was founded in {{Yearlink|-3847}}. It attracted followers from all across Netheril, overtime quickly becoming both a retreat and a place of learning. As it grew in popularity, religious and genealogical records were increasingly stored within it.\n\nIn the year {{Yearlink|-3326}}, a forest fire ravaged the nearby mountains and engulfed the abbey, destroying it. During that era rumors attributed its destruction to either worshipers of [[Kozah]] or [[Shar]]. Many attempts were made to rebuild the abbey, but none came to fruition.\n\nIn the year {{Yearlink|-2871}}, rumors began circulating that some [[ghost]]s had taken control of the abbey's burned-out ruins. Many [[adventurer]]s and holy warriors would to try and drive the ghosts out. But these [[undead]] frighteningly powerful [[spell]]s, causing either death or retreat to all adventuring expeditions that dared to face them.\n\nAround the year {{Yearlink|-339}},On page 9 of the adventure module ''[[How the Mighty Are Fallen]]'', a woman's year of death is given as 3519 NY, or {{Yearlink|-340}}. Her death is described as occurring several months ago. On page 58, a table gives several year ranges, culminating in 3520 NY, or {{Yearlink|-339}}. As such, this wiki treats the adventure module as being set in −339 DR. rumors circulated claiming that the abbey had somehow rebuilt itself. Sages from [[Karsus Enclave]] believed that the structure somehow absorbed the personalities of the ghosts that had long been haunting it. Around that time a dozen [[human]] [[monk]]s began planning a five-month [[pilgrim]]age to the site, seeking to take up residence there.\n\nCenturies later, following the [[Spellplague]], one could still find a few stone markers and toppled columns from this abbey.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|64}}"
