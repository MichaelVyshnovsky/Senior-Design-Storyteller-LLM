        "mainbody": "'''Burnleir's Barrels''' was a cooper business in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "This business was located in a building that fronted the west side of the [[Street of Six Casks]], four doors south from where it met [[Presper Street]].",
        "Services": "Being a cooper business, Burnleir's specialized in the production of [[barrel]]s. By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the building focused on producing small handkegs and ornamental-finish \"show\" barrels. Another building owned by the business, located somewhere outside of Waterdeep, was centered around the \"heavy\" work of mass producing and storing larger barrels.",
        "History": "Burnleir's Barrels was one of the six competing cooper businesses that fronted the Street of Six Casks, earning its moniker. As the business was passed down through generations, it would come to be one of the two surviving businesses on that street, the other being [[Lithandy Fine Casks]]."
