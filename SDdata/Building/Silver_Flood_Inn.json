        "mainbody": "he Silver Flood Inn was a boarding house found in the town of Daggerford during the latter half of the 15 century DR.\nIts decorations played up the theme of a \"mining\" town. Its walls were adorned with mining equipment and it offered \"silver\" plates and flatware, which were in fact made of pewter.\nThe inn offered good rooms for rent at reasonable prices.\nDuring the midâ€“15 century, Daggerford experienced a swell in residents as silver was discovered within the nearby Sword Hills. The inn was formed and named in response to this \"silver rush\".\nThe Silver Floods owners came to their position in a quite unusual manner. While they were guests of the inn, Connar Filvarson and Ganfar Redgrin became quite drunk and did a fair amount of damage to the establishment. Rather than be arrested, they offered an enormous diamond as recompense to its owner and, by means of an agreement with the then-current duke, settled the situation. The two men became the new innkeepers of the Silver Flood, its previous owner was granted significant wealth, and the duke was able to add a new piece of diamond jewelry to his collection."
