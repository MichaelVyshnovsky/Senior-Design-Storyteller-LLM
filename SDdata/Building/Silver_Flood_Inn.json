        "mainbody": "The '''Silver Flood Inn''' was a boarding house found in the town of [[Daggerford]] during the latter half of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Interior": "Its decorations played up the theme of a \"mining\" town. Its walls were adorned with mining equipment and it offered \"silver\" plates and [[flatware]], which were in fact made of [[pewter]].",
        "Services": "The inn offered good rooms for rent at reasonable prices.",
        "History": "During the midâ€“15{{th}} century, Daggerford experienced a swell in residents as [[silver]] was discovered within the nearby [[Sword Hills]]. The inn was formed and named in response to this \"silver rush\".\n\nThe Silver Flood's owners came to their position in a quite unusual manner. While they were guests of the inn, [[Connar Filvarson]] and [[Ganfar Redgrin]] became quite drunk and did a fair amount of damage to the establishment. Rather than be arrested, they offered an enormous [[diamond]] as recompense to its owner and, by means of an agreement with the then-current duke, settled the situation. The two men became the new innkeepers of the Silver Flood, its previous owner was granted significant wealth, and the duke was able to add a new piece of diamond jewelry to his collection."
