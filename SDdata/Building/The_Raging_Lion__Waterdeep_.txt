The Raging Lion was an inn that was located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The inn was located on Lion Street in the northeastern section of Waterdeeps North Ward.
Much of the interior of the Raging Lion was paneled with dark wood and worn carpets covered the entire floor. Glowing globes illuminated the interior.
The inn maintained a strict policy against lighting any flames this included smoking tobacco products.
The cellar of the Raging Lion was once used as a temple by noble cultists of Kambadlan the Black Tortoise of Night. This was the source of several Waterdhavian oaths including "by the Black Tortoise!" and "by the shell of Kambadlan!"
The Raging Lion was owned by a man named Lhaerhlin Masram. Several dwarves and female adventurers used the inn as their home. They helped Lhaerhlin maintain order during their stays between outings.
