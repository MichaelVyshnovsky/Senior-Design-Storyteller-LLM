'''Waukeen's Circle''' was a [[Standing Stone|stone circle]] and market in the middle of [[Trademeet]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The Circle was a ring of seven rounded stone slabs set on their edges used as a marketplace in the town. It was held to be a holy site of [[Waukeen]], and believed to enforce the [[Merchant's Peace]] of Trademeet. A merchant who broke the accord was believed to die horribly, or at least Waukeen's displeasure would be noted by one of the stones cracking.

==History==
The stone circle was originally used as a caravan stop, leading to the founding of Trademeet in [[223 DR]].

It was believed that Waukeen herself manifested in the Circle on the [[Shieldmeet]] of [[920 DR]]. She was outraged to find that the market was filled with lying merchants, inferior goods, and dishonest deals. She turned the High Merchant's hands to [[gold]] and divvied up the fingers to the wronged parties (inspiring the Amnian curse "[[Delosar]]'s fingers!") and declared the Merchant's Peace, with the result that Trademeet was the most honest and fair caravan stop and market in Amn.
