        "mainbody": "he House of Entropy was a temple dedicated to the worship of Entropy located within the city of Bezantur, Thay.\nThe temple was located in northern Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". It sat between Myulons Inn and the citys Temple of Jergal.\nThe temple had no windows and only a single small door. The entire structure was jet black.\nSermons were delivered by a high priest, and preached against wizards and the use of magic. However, the Red Wizards were either conveniently omitted from these prohibitions or were claimed to be an exception to them.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the temples position as an anti-mage organization made its status in the Red Wizard-controlled city somewhat tentative. The identity of the Houses high priest was unknown, and he wore black robes and a dark veil to conceal himself when delivering sermons."
