The Last Outpost was a popular tavern found in the small village of Helmsdale in Damara.
This tavern was a favorite point of rest for many travelers along the road north of Goliad.
The tavern, along with much of Helmsdale, was ruined during the invasion and subsequent occupation of the town by the forces of Zhengyi the Witch-King during the Vaasan War. After his forces were finally expelled twelve years later in the aftermath of the Bloodstone Wars, the Lost Outpost was the first structure to be rebuilt.
