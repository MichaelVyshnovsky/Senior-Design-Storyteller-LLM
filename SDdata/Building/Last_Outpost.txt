The '''Last Outpost''' was a popular tavern found in the small village of [[Helmsdale]] in [[Damara]].

==Description==
This tavern was a favorite point of rest for many travelers along the road north of [[Goliad]].

==History==
The tavern, along with much of Helmsdale, was ruined during the invasion and subsequent occupation of the town by the forces of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] during the [[Vaasan War]]. After his forces were finally expelled twelve years later in the aftermath of the [[Bloodstone Wars]], the Lost Outpost was the first structure to be rebuilt.
