        "mainbody": "The '''Harfin Draether''' was a tavern located on the corner of [[Oblade Street]] and the [[Street of Seven Altars]] within the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] of [[Athkatla]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was named after its [[Harfin Drather (person)|founder]], who died well before the 1370s [[DR]].",
        "Description": {
            "Services": "The Harfin Drather was renowned for its hearty, if not particularly tasty meals, as well as its lightning-fast service. Its list of available wines and meals was meager at best. They did offer [[Saravva]], a tart-tasting wine from vineyards near [[Esmeltaran]], as well as the bitter [[Uldar]] from [[Eshpurta]]. \n\nThe quality of food was hit-or-miss. The most popular dish was the tavern's famed roasted fowl, cooked to perfection, and served on a plate with a variety of sauces and [[mustard]]. The [[melon]] [[pie]], however, was often partially rotten and infested with flies. The delectable sugar cookies that accompanied the dessert made up for its overall repulsiveness."
