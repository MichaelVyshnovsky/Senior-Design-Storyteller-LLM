Shipwrights House was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Order of Master Shipwrights.
This building was located at the corner of Dock Street and Asterils Way, in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This building stood two-stories tall.
Like other guildhalls in the Dock Ward, Shipwrights House was considered by locals to be a landmark.
The Shipwrights Ball was annually held here on the last tenday of Ches, as part of the Fleetswake festival.
