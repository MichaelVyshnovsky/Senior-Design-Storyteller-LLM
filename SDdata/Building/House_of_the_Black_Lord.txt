The '''House of the Black Lord''' was a temple of [[Bane]] in [[Mulmaster]] that came to be the center of worship of the Black Lord throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located on the east side of the city, not far off from the [[Mulmaster/Zhents' Quarter|Zhents' Quarter]].{{Mulmaster-Orientation}}

==Activities==
As of the late 1470s, the temple became a source of political strife between different factions that had formed within the ruling [[Blades (Mulmaster)|Council of Blades]]. While the councilors that shared in Bane's worship created a powerful sect within the city, they were directly opposed by other belligerent members of the Blades, or those who shared a different faith altogether.

==History==
The temple was formed some time after the rise of [[Iyachtu Xvim]]'s faith in the [[Moonsea]] region, following the death of Bane at the hands of [[Cyric]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. While it was originally dedicated to the worship of the Godson, it had switched over to the worship of Bane by the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.
