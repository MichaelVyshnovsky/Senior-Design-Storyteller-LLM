'''Shipwreckhome''' was a small inn in the [[aquatic elf]] city of [[Myth Nantar]].

==Location==
This inn was located in the [[Myth Nantar/Dukar Quarter|Dukar Quarter]] of Myth Nantar.

==Structure==
This building stood two stories tall and had a balcony. The exterior of the building was decorated with a wide variety of curiosities gathered from shipwrecks that occured north of Myth Nantar.

==Interior==
Much like its exterior, the interior of Shipwreckhome was decorated with many shipwreck curiosities. At its front door stood an [[alabaster]] figurehead of a weeping maiden and a [[copper]] figurehead of a [[wizard]].

==Services==
Shipwreckhome both served food and rented out rooms. It catered to the tastes of both [[merfolk]] and surface dwellers, with its proprietor [[Kana]] having learned to overcook [[fish]] to satisfy the tastes of the latter.
