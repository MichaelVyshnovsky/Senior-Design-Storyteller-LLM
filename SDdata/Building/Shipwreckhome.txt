Shipwreckhome was a small inn in the aquatic elf city of Myth Nantar.
This inn was located in the Dukar Quarter of Myth Nantar.
This building stood two stories tall and had a balcony. The exterior of the building was decorated with a wide variety of curiosities gathered from shipwrecks that occured north of Myth Nantar.
Much like its exterior, the interior of Shipwreckhome was decorated with many shipwreck curiosities. At its front door stood an alabaster figurehead of a weeping maiden and a copper figurehead of a wizard.
Shipwreckhome both served food and rented out rooms. It catered to the tastes of both merfolk and surface dwellers, with its proprietor Kana having learned to overcook fish to satisfy the tastes of the latter.
