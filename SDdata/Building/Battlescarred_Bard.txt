The '''Battlescarred Bard''' was an [[inn]] along the [[Trade Way]] in [[Zehoarastria]] in [[Amn]], about halfway between [[Purskul]] and [[Imnescar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
It was a one-story inn with a large stable attached.

==Atmosphere==
Fights were common, but belligerent patrons were taken outside by the large innkeeper. Bards were allowed inside but only if they did not play any song.

==Menu==
Dishes such as plate-of-gold (battered and fried vegetables drizzled with [[honey]]), warrior's head ([[pickles]] in oil with whole [[garlic]] bulbs), glazed [[ham]] and haunches, and chopforest ([[onion]]s and green salad with [[olive]]s).

The bar served [[ale]], [[wine]], [[zzar]], and [[sherry]].
