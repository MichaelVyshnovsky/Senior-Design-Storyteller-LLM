The Battlescarred Bard was an inn along the Trade Way in Zehoarastria in Amn, about halfway between Purskul and Imnescar in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
It was a one-story inn with a large stable attached.
Fights were common, but belligerent patrons were taken outside by the large innkeeper. Bards were allowed inside but only if they did not play any song.
Dishes such as plate-of-gold (battered and fried vegetables drizzled with honey), warriors head (pickles in oil with whole garlic bulbs), glazed ham and haunches, and chopforest (onions and green salad with olives).
The bar served ale, wine, zzar, and sherry.
