The Prince and Pauper was a discreet gambling establishment in the city of Iriaebor. It was owned by a man named Cormik.
The building laid on the Street of Lanterns, in the Old City.
The dark storefront looked like it had been abandoned for years, but inside was a large room.
There were backrooms in the building that were used for more important or private matters that Cormik wanted to attend to.
