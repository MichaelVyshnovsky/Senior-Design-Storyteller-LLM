The '''Citadel of the Iron Sky''' was a castle located in [[Telos City]], the capital of [[Vaasa]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the center of political and religious power for the [[Warlock Knights]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}

==Location==
The Citadel dominated the Telos city center, and sat directly at the middle of the impact crater made by the [[primordial]] [[Telos]] when it landed in Vaasa.

==Structure==
The Citadel was a large, fortified castle. and additionally had spaces dedicated as a temple to the primordial Telos.

==Activities==
The Citadel of the Iron Sky served as the headquarters for the Warlock Knights. Under the rule of the [[Voice of Telos]], the castle was the site from which both the Ironfell Council governed the realm of Vaasa and the [[Luminaries]] presided over the worship of Telos. Beneath the Citadel, the Knights mined ''[[ironfell]]'' from the sleeping primordial's body.

==History==
The Citadel was constructed sometime after the [[Spellplague]] when Telos crashed into the Vaasan tundra. It was named in honor of the fallen primordial, who was also known as the Master of the Iron Sky. 

As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}},{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} the Citadel was the center of power in Vaasa, although the governing members of the Ironfell Council only convened sparingly each month in its halls to decide matters of state. Visitors to Telos City were not allowed anywhere in or near the Citadel without special invitation.
