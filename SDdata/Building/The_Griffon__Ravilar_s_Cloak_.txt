'''The Griffon''', or '''the Griffon Cup''', was rowdy drinking establishment in the village of [[Ravilar's Cloak]], [[Turmish]].

==Services==
Bar brawls were the most popular local pastime, and with only two taverns in the city, both the Griffon and the [[Dog and Bone]], often provided such entertainment. A pile of drunken commoners pushing their way out of the Griffon and pummeling each other on the street was a common sight in Ravilar's Cloak. Although the Griffon was a slightly more expensive and nicer establishment than the Dog and Bone, it never stopped the miners from starting brawls.
