The Griffon, or the Griffon Cup, was rowdy drinking establishment in the village of Ravilars Cloak, Turmish.
Bar brawls were the most popular local pastime, and with only two taverns in the city, both the Griffon and the Dog and Bone, often provided such entertainment. A pile of drunken commoners pushing their way out of the Griffon and pummeling each other on the street was a common sight in Ravilars Cloak. Although the Griffon was a slightly more expensive and nicer establishment than the Dog and Bone, it never stopped the miners from starting brawls.
