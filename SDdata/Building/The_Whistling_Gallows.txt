'''The Whistling Gallows''', previously known as '''Skeld's Place''', was a small historic tavern and an inn, located in [[Lonelywood]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

{{quote|'''Tis said that he was fond of using that dead tree out front as a sort of impromptu gallows. Back then, the inn was known as Skeld's Place. However, it didn't take long for word of Skeld's cruelty to spread. However, that unfortunate business is all in the past. Skeld is dead and buried, and now I am the proprietor of this inn. The only legacy that remains of Skeld's brief, yet brutal, tenure is the establishment's name... the Whistling Gallows Inn.''|Kieran Nye}}

==Structure==
[[File:Whistling Gallows 1.png|thumb|''The taproom and the innkeep's lodgings.''|330x330px]]
The inn was a large log building with two stores located close to the heart of Lonelywood.

==Interior==
[[File:Whistling Gallows 2.png|thumb|''The inn's second floor and guest rooms.''|330x330px]]
The inn's large taproom opened up as soon as a guest stepped through the front doors. The entire interior could be described as rustic. The log walls were abundantly decorated with a collection of antlers and taxidermied beast heads. A firepit was at the taproom's center, with roasts slowly turning, dripping fat and juices into the flames underneath. Long wooden tables and benches were spread around the room, illuminated with candles. Directly across from the main entrance stood the stairway to the second floor. To the left of the stairs stretched a long barstand made out of a single massive sawed [[tree]] trunk with tree stumps in front of it instead of bar stools. Shelves full of alcohol, kegs, and bottles were behind the bar, as well as a small metal tub to wash tankards in.

To the entrance's left side, a small hallway was locked behind a door. From there, the proprietor accessed a small kitchen and the cold storage. On the opposite side was the room used by the tavernkeep as lodgings. It was a small room with a huge mirror built into a wall. The mirror, however, was "magical," if some were to be believed. It could be opened, allowing passage to a secret room used by Kieran Nye as a wizard's lab, filled with [[book]]s, [[enchanted]] trinkets, reagents, and a ''[[crystal orb]]'' perched atop a pedestal, radiating blueish glow. The lab's walls were draped in expensive-looking blue tapestries. Some of the curious items there included a [[rogue stone]], a ''[[robe of the neutral archmagi]]'' ''[[translocation arrow]]s'', a flask of ''[[oil of speed]]'', and a scroll of a rare mage [[spell]] – ''[[seven eyes]]''.

The second floor was fully used to house guests – a long hallway of rooms with various levels of decoration, but most included a nightstand, a bed, a wash tub, and some had more mounted beast heads and wardrobes. The hallway was decorated with several hanging paintings.

==Services==
The Whistling Gallows offered warm beds, strong drinks, and food to its guests. In [[1281 DR]], the inn had a resident drunkard who was also the entertainment – [[bard]] [[Murdaugh]]. If one were to discover Kieran Nye's secret, the wizard offered to trade some of his most precious magical artifacts in exchange for their silence.

Some of the drinks sold at the inn were simple cheap [[ale]]s, [[Iriaeboran North Brew]], [[Knee Cracker Cider]], [[Luskan stout]], [[Winter Wine]], [[Bitter Black Ale]], [[Cormyran brandy]], and [[Moonshae whiskey]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1232}}, there were no settlements north of [[Termalaine]]. The land surrounding the [[Lonely Wood]] held nothing more than several logging camps and trapper huts. The town truly was born with the construction of the famous Whistling Gallows Inn. Back then, the inn was better known as Skeld's Place, run by a violent [[half-ogre]] named [[Skeld]] who clobbered unruly patrons and used a tree outside the inn to hang those who wronged him. At night, cold northern winds whistled between all the hanged frozen corpses. Soon after, houses started appearing around the inn, and more people started settling in the secluded northernmost town. Only shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, Lonelywood was recognized by the council of the Icewind Dale. Skeld died sometime before 1281 DR, and the inn was purchased by Kieran Nye, an old [[Tethyr]]ean [[wizard]] who at one point was a member of the organization that would eventually be known as the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]]. Kieran was a deserter, and the Host Tower wanted him dead, so he kept his past affiliation a secret.
