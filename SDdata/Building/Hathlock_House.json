        "mainbody": "The Hathlock House was a humble inn in an abandoned settlement of Hathlocks Rest on the Bowshot road in the Border Kingdoms.\nHathlock House and the Hathlocks Rest were located north of the Trollhead Bridge that crossed a boggy area of the Owlhold region in the Border Kingdoms. The abandoned settlement stood on the Bowshot north of the area where it climbed up from the low bogs \nHathlock House offered moderately-priced services. Its rooms were spartan but affordable and lacked any luxuries or amenities other inns usually offered. The food and drink served at the Hathlock House were just as humble and plain.\nHathlocks Rest was abandoned by the late 14 century DR, with the Hathlock House being its only inhabited building.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the inn was home to seven local trappers, furriers, and hunters."
