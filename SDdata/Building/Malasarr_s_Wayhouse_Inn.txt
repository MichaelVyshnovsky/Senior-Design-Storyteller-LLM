'''Malasarr's Wayhouse Inn''' was a ramshackle inn located within the fortified city of [[Yeshpek]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The inn consisted of a number of different homes, stores, and stables linked together with shabby catwalks and stairs. The rooms were sparsely decorated with a simple cot and lantern. A single outdoor privy was provided for the entire compound.

Each room featured a doorbar for security, but criminals had been known to simply break through the thin walls to rob guests.

==Activities==
Malasarr's Wayhouse Inn was attractive only to travelers on an extremely tight budget since rooms could be had for only four [[copper]]s a night. Meals were not included with that price, but washwater was sent to the rooms.
