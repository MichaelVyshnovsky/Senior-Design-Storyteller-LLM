Malasarrs Wayhouse Inn was a ramshackle inn located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 century DR.
The inn consisted of a number of different homes, stores, and stables linked together with shabby catwalks and stairs. The rooms were sparsely decorated with a simple cot and lantern. A single outdoor privy was provided for the entire compound.
Each room featured a doorbar for security, but criminals had been known to simply break through the thin walls to rob guests.
Malasarrs Wayhouse Inn was attractive only to travelers on an extremely tight budget since rooms could be had for only four coppers a night. Meals were not included with that price, but washwater was sent to the rooms.
