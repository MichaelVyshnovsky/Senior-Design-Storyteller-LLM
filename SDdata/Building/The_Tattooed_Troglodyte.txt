The Tattooed Troglodyte was a tavern located in the city of Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.
The tavern was located in the southeast section of the city several blocks from the docks.
Considered one of the better taverns in the city, the Tattooed Troglodyte often catered to sailors with coin to spend. The sailors rarely had enough coin for a room and drink, so were often simply tossed out into the street when their coin ran out.
