'''The Stag at Rest''' was a small tavern found in [[Kheldell]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Description==
This dark tavern was filled with worn furniture. Flagstones covered the floor and a low ceiling kept patrons on alert.

==Activites==
As the only tavern in Kheldell, The Stag at Rest was the only place around to catch up on the latest gossip over a pint of ale after a long day's work. If space was available, paying customers could sleep at the Stag for free.

==Inhabitants==
The Stag was owned by [[Delgara Dauntsword]].
