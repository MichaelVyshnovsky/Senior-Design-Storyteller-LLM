The Stag at Rest was a small tavern found in Kheldell in 1367 DR.
This dark tavern was filled with worn furniture. Flagstones covered the floor and a low ceiling kept patrons on alert.
As the only tavern in Kheldell, The Stag at Rest was the only place around to catch up on the latest gossip over a pint of ale after a long days work. If space was available, paying customers could sleep at the Stag for free.
The Stag was owned by Delgara Dauntsword.
