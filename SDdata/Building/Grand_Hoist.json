        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Hoist''' was an unfinished lift designed to ferry goods back and forth between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Skullport]]. The hoist was designed to bypass the dangers of [[Undermountain]] and the [[Lapel Sea]].",
        "History": "The grand scheme was conceived by a former leader of the [[Mandible]] gang. Two teams began digging the shaft, one under Waterdeep and the second in Skullport. The project was a series of disasters that bankrupted most of its investors. As of [[1479 DR]], the Mandibles continued work on the project although at a reduced pace.",
