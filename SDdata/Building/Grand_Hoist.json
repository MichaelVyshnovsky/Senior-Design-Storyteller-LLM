        "mainbody": "The Grand Hoist was an unfinished lift designed to ferry goods back and forth between Waterdeep and Skullport. The hoist was designed to bypass the dangers of Undermountain and the Lapel Sea.\nThe grand scheme was conceived by a former leader of the Mandible gang. Two teams began digging the shaft, one under Waterdeep and the second in Skullport. The project was a series of disasters that bankrupted most of its investors. As of 1479 DR, the Mandibles continued work on the project although at a reduced pace.\nCategoryLandmarks\nCategoryLocations in Skullport\nCategoryLocations in Undermountain\nCategoryLocations in Waterdeep\nktyleetywyhsyby6ux0o8ua8xxk8v29"
