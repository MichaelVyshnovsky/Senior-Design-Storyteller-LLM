        "Services": "Benante supplied fine meats to residents of Karsus within a 20-block radius, enjoying the financial support of his wife [[Acciajuoli]] that allowed him to pursue the highest quality without worrying about quantity. [[Cattle]] and [[sheep]] were slaughtered using a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Negative Energy plane]] that painlessly drained their life force. After the carcasses hung and drained for three days, the priest [[Franchvail]] used her divine magics to ''[[bless]]'' and purify the meats of any [[parasite]]s or [[disease]]s before it was cut to the customer's specifications."
