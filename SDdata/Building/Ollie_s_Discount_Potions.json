        "mainbody": "Ollies Discount Potions was a discount potions shop in the city of Ravens Bluffs Flask Circle market in the late 14 century DR.\nSeveral glass cases could be found within the store, displaying its vast array of potions. And a small bell hung above the entryway, ringing upon anyone entering the shop.\nOllies sold a wide variety of potions in all manners of color, shape, and size. The majority of these potions were unlabeled as a deterrent to thieves, though a select few had stiff pieces of paper in front of them that had their name written down.\nPotions were not sold at a static price, but rather frequently individually adjusted in value based upon the local supply and demand.\nCustomers were typically limited to buying three potions at a time in order to ensure a moderate stock was maintained. Some of the potions on offer on a given day included potions of animal control, clairaudience, clairvoyance, climbing, diminution, ESP, healing and extra-healing, fire resistance, levitation, polymorph self, rainbow hues, speed, water breathing, and elixirs of health.\nSometime in the late 14 century DR, a group of thieves called the Hands of Mohammad robbed Ollies Discount Potions of nearly all its inventory while the owner was away and the nearby Practical Potions of its entire stock. Three days later a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle asking about both robberies, having been tasked by the City Watch to track down the thieves, but the operator of Ollies had nothing to share and the owner of Practical Potions had since fled from Ravens Bluff.\nThis store was operated by an elf simply known as Ollie."
