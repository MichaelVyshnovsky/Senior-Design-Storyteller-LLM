The  Red Gauntlet was a tavern located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The tavern stood on the north side of the southern stretch of the Way of the Dragon in the Tween Run of Waterdeeps Southern Ward.
The tavern stood two stories tall. The interior was poorly lit and shabby.
Food served here consisted mostly of dried fish, waybread, and rabbit-and-fowl stew. Drink consisted of a house wine. The fares were cheap in the Red Gauntlet with a plate of food running just 3 cp and a tankard 2 cp.
The Red Gauntlet allowed patrons to drink themselves to sleep and stay, provided they did not snore too loudly. Anyone becoming rowdy or threatening was slipped a sleep syrup in their drink to placate them.
The Red Gauntlet was owned by a retired thief named Daunt Buirune.
