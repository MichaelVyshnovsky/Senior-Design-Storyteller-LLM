'''Silverhand Tower''' was the primary residence of [[Dornal Silverhand]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was also the birthplace of the [[Seven Sisters]].

==Location==
The tower stood in a wooded dell{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-01-10 - Elué Shundar}} and nearer the site of would later be the location of [[Longsaddle]].

==Structure==
Silverhand Tower was little more than a cottage attached to an empty ring of battlements on a collapsed keep by the 760s DR. There was a small vegetable garden nearby, and presumably a stream and a stump both visible from the cottage.

==History==
After [[Dornal Silverhand]] and [[Elué Shundar]] got married, they moved to Silverhand Tower, where Dornal's senile mother welcomed Elué as the "sorceress in the moonlight" of her dreams ere passing away.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|101}}

In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, Dornal, upon learning his wife's transformation into something ever closer to a [[lich]] was due to possession by some entity of overwhelming power, murdered his wife and fled the lands. Their six daughters were orphaned, which prompted [[Mystra]] to send her [[Chosen of Mystra|Chosen]], [[Elminster Aumar]], to look after the little girls.
