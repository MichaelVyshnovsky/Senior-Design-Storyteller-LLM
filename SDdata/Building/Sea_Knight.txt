The '''Sea Knight''' was a tavern in [[Waterdeep]].

It completely collapsed in the {{YearlinkName|1425}}. The cause was unknown; some locals said it was a [[wizard]]'s duel, others said [[Spellplague]]. A entrepreneurial miner excavated the cellar and found a passage to [[Undermountain]], and went on to build the [[Knight 'n Shadow]] tavern on the site.
