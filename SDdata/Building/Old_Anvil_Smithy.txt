The Old Anvil Smithy was the noisy, soot-covered workshop of the master blacksmith of Sundabar, Alabuth Helfyn. Though it was little more than a barn of a building, Alabuth called the Old Anvil his home, and from there he crafted arms and armor for the people of Sundabar. It was located just around the corner from Turnstone gate in the eastern section of the city. 
Though they had been independently invented in other regions of Toril, Sundabar was known as the birthplace for the invention of caltrops in the North. These small, metal spiked objects, that could halt the charge of mounted barbarians, were a renowned export of the Old Anvil Smithy.
