'''The Pit''' was a derelict gambling den found in [[Teshwave]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
The Pit also served as a [[tavern]] and festhall for the occupants of Teshwave.

==Inhabitants==
The establishment was run by off-duty soldiers and was a coveted assignment given the lascivious nature of the building. [[Zhentilar]], mercenaries, and nonhuman troops visited the Pit for entertainment.
