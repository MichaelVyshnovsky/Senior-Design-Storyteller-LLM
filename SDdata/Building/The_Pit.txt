The Pit was a derelict gambling den found in Teshwave around 1367 DR.
The Pit also served as a tavern and festhall for the occupants of Teshwave.
The establishment was run by off-duty soldiers and was a coveted assignment given the lascivious nature of the building. Zhentilar, mercenaries, and nonhuman troops visited the Pit for entertainment.
