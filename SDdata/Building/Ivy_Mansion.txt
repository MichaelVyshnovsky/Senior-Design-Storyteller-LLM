The Ivy Mansion was the wondrous ancestral home of the Harpell family of wizards.
The mansion was located atop a hill overlooking the nearby town of Longsaddle in the Savage Frontier of northwest Faer√ªn.

Three main structures dominated the compound a stable, a farm building, and the living quarters of the mansion itself. Though it appeared to be a normal stable from the outside, the interior of the stable housed hundreds of miniaturized animals and creatures housed in neatly stacked containers. More magically reduced creatures grazed within the farm building.
The main structure of the Ivy Mansion was expanded over the generations based upon the whims and wishes of each Harpell living there, resulting in a truly wondrous abode abundant with magic. When viewed from the outside, the Ivy Mansion appeared to be a collection of many smaller buildings with no coherent style of architecture. Thousands of windows covered the mansion.
A magical fence surrounded the entire compound. The fence, though completely invisible, was painted to resemble a regular fence. Several false gates were found along the fence line, blocking anyone trying to enter through that part. The real passageways through the fence were disguised with magic and located elsewhere along the fence off of the main paths.
A small stream separated the Ivy Mansion from Longsaddle. The stream flowed uphill and could only be crossed at a bizarre over/under bridge. When crossing the bridge to get to the mansion one needed to walk upside down on the under bridge, and to depart one needed to walk on the over bridge. The under bridge was, of course, invisible.
