The A.V.O.W. shelter (an acronym for Animal Victims of War) was an animal shelter in the Tent City outside of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
Working in conjunction with Marigolds Menagerie, this facility sought to heal animals injured during The Three Womens War and find new homes for animals that lost their owners.
This facility was established in 1370 DR, following the Three Womens War, with the help of generosity from adventurers.
This facility was operated by Mindy Mufflefoot & Victoria Shadai.
