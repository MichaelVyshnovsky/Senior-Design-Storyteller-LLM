'''Dar al-Kalif''', or the '''Crystal Palace''', was the royal palace of [[Abu Bakr]], Caliph of [[Semphar]].

==Location==
Dar al-Kalif was located in the heart of [[Dhaztanar]].

==Structure==
The structure of the Crystal Palace was crowned with minarets of clear crystal rock, which was transported, at great expense, from the mines of the distant [[Firepeaks]]. Sunlight illuminated these crystal spires with radiance, giving Dhaztanar its nickname of the Shining City. A fire was lit within the tallest spire at night. Sailors on the [[Semphar Water]] could see the beacon from up to 50 miles (80 km) away. 

==Inhabitants==
Abu Bakr lived within the palace.
