Steeleyes Armory and Smithy was a smithy of Angar "Steeleye" Axesons that dealt in arms and armors, located in Mosstone, Tethyr.
Steeleyes Armory and Smithy offered quality items for sale. The old "Steeleye" accepted commissions, charging one-fifth more than most other weapon crafters in the region. He worked slowly and methodically, but his skill allowed him to replicate almost any piece of equipment brought to him with ease. "Steeleye" could even forge items indistinguishable in look and strength from ancient elven masters. In addition, he produced original gear of supreme quality and offered alteration as well as repair services.
Angar Axeson was committed to his craft and was diligent with his clients. He was known to work over several nights and days to finish a piece in time. For this, "Steeleye" was had a constant steady workflow from Tethyrian nobles who paid handsomely for Angars skill and often did not have deadlines on commission, allowing him to work on the projects sometimes over the course of a year.
The proprietor of Steeleyes Armory and Smithy, old "Steeleye," was a talented blacksmith of the first rank who survived the Reclamation Wars and had scars to prove it. He personally greeted customers who entered the shop.
Angar did not tolerate being pushed around nor customers demanding him to work on their orders before the previous commission was finished.
