The High Tide was the largest tavern in Skullport and was built atop a brewery.
Only invited guests were allowed to enter the tavern and the exclusiveness made the business a favorite with Skullports leaders. The establishment was owned by a kobold named Gnawlip who sold information he overheard while waiting on patrons.
