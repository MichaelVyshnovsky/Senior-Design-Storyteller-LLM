        "mainbody": "The Crypt of Shadows was one of the two most significant temples of Osiris in all of Mulhorand and his preeminent temple in the town of Jhalhoran.\nThe Crypt resembled one of the pyramids of Mulhorand, but much smaller in size and constructed of dark granite. On the ground level, each face of the structure had several doors. The most peculiar feature of the temple was it being perpetually shrouded in shadows, which werent caused by any visible obstructions of the sun.\nWithin this temple the Church of Osiris maintained a repository of various lore on both the afterlife and Osiran teachings."
