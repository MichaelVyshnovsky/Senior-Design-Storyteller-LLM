Hondakars House was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
This big inn stood in the middle of the citys High District, and its high prices and high quality reflected that.
As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Hondakars House was expressly an inn.
