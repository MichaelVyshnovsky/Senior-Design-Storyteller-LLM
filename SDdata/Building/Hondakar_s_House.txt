'''Hondakar's House''' was an inn in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

This big inn stood in the middle of the city's High District, and its high prices and high quality reflected that.

As Lord [[Dhelt]] decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Hondakar's House was expressly an inn.
