        "mainbody": "I Shot an Arrow was a tavern in Arrowmark.\nThis rustic tavern was an inexpensive place that was popular with Arrowmarks craftsfolk. It had a quiet and calm atmosphere, the locals quickly ejected any who became too loud or tried to start a brawl. It was not uncommon for a bard to play a harp but  the patrons of I Shot an Arrow never sang along or even danced."
