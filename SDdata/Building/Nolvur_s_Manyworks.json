        "mainbody": "olvurs Manyworks was a former residence in Khôltar, south Faerûn, that had been converted into rental space for offices and workshops, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis building was next door to Hindror House on the northwest side of Orntathtar Way, a short walk from Dubrinlar, the western gate into Khôltar, the Iron City. Starting from Darrusktraal&mdashthe duty house and fortress that guarded the gate&mdashand proceeding northeast up Orntathtar Way was the ornately decorated Halamors Tower, then Hindror House, and then Nolvurs Manyworks. Across the street from Nolvurs was the Malgart House, home of the courts and judiciary, that faced west out of the gate.\nNolvurs Manyworks was a fist (small residential tower) that was shorter than Halamors Tower and much less gaudy.\nBecause Halamor was so successful at renting out rooms and floors of his residence to finecrafters (folks who assembled and put the finishing touches on much of the ironmongery produced in the Iron City), Nolvurs Manyworks did the same."
