        "mainbody": "'''Nolvur's Manyworks''' was a former residence in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], that had been converted into rental space for offices and workshops, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}",
        "Location": "This building was next door to [[Hindror House]] on the northwest side of [[Orntathtar Way]], a short walk from Dubrinlar, the western gate into Khôltar, the Iron City. Starting from [[Darrusktraal]]&mdash;the duty house and fortress that guarded the gate&mdash;and proceeding northeast up Orntathtar Way was the ornately decorated [[Halamor's Tower]], then Hindror House, and then Nolvur's Manyworks. Across the street from Nolvur's was the [[Malgart House]], home of the courts and judiciary, that faced west out of the gate.",
        "Structure": "Nolvur's Manyworks was a fist (small residential tower) that was shorter than Halamor's Tower and much less gaudy.",
        "Services": "Because [[Halamor]] was so successful at renting out rooms and floors of his residence to finecrafters (folks who assembled and put the finishing touches on much of the ironmongery produced in the Iron City), Nolvur's Manyworks did the same."
