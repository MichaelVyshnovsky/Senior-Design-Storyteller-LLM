        "mainbody": "The '''Hall of Mystery''' was a heavily warded [[Church of Mystra|Mystran]] temple constructed in [[Ravens Bluff]] after the previous temple had been destroyed.{{Cite polyhedron/137/City Stories: The Hall of Mystery|10}}",
        "Location": "The temple was located at the southeast corner of Thayverdasz Way and Quevver Street in the [[Ravens Bluff/Skymbles|Skymbles]] neighborhood of the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was a series of five fortified buildings, with each structure primarily made of blue [[granite]],{{Cite polyhedron/137/City Stories: The Hall of Mystery|11}} Each building was {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} high and topped with crenelations. There were also two floors below ground, stretching deep enough to be located just above the water table. Outside, there was an area reserved for spellcasting, a stable and kennels that could accommodate magical creatures, as well as a topiary garden that included a hedge maze.\n\nLow-energy lightning bolts crawled randomly along the walls&mdash;a ward designed to paralyze any would-be intruders, but also serving to draw notice to the building.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Since Ravens Bluff also boasted a [[Diviners Guild]], [[Wizards Guild]], and the city's [[Ministry of Art]], the staff of The Hall of Mystery had more time on their hands than most Mystran temples, allowing them to have more fun than was typically expected of priests of The Lady of Mysteries."
        },
        "Services": "The temple's priests offered free moral support and guidance to the laity. The services that they charged for, however, were aiding magic-users in the research of spells and magical effects, as well as the identification of magical items. They catalogued all that they learned, storing that knowledge in their museum and library for future reference. One of their priestesses was also a prophet who had supernatural insight into magical dangers.",
        "Activities": "The Hall of Mystery sponsored a knightly order, the [[Keepers of the Mystic Flame]], which was dedicated to protecting Ravens Bluff from magical threats and foreign organizations.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/130/Keepers of the Mystic Flame|16}} Public demonstrations of simple magic were organized by the temple to try and identify children with an aptitude for [[wizard]]ry as early as possible.",
        "Defenses": "The [[Weave]] was particularly strong where The Hall of Mystery was located, fueling an impressive number of magical wards and other defenses. As well as the defensive lightning that crawled over the temple walls, the complex was entirely warded against [[teleport]]ation, no matter the [[magic]] used in the attempt, and anything flying over the airspace above the temple would have any magical effects on it dispelled. The library, underground archives, and roof were all warded to snuff out any fires or fire-based magic, and many other magical [[Glyph of warding|glyphs]], [[guards and wards]] protected the temple grounds. [[Helmed horror]]s and a wide variety of incorruptible [[golem]]s guarded the building's doors and halls, and the priests and Keepers of the Mystic Flame could all be relied upon to defend the complex. As well, any attack spell cast by a Mystran priest within the building dealt the maximum possible damage. Any defender wounded or enspelled in the temple could be taken to the basement, where a pit of blue magical slime would heal them of all injuries, remove any curses, and dispel most malign magics within an hour's time. The thick granite walls, specially engineered for defense, could also withstand sustained physical attack.",
        "History": "The Hall of Mystery was the second temple to bear the name in Ravens Bluff, the first having been destroyed by [[tanar'ri]]. To avoid such happening again, it was constructed primarily with defense in mind.\n\nSome of the more overt activities of the Keepers of the Mystic Flame had drawn negative attention to the temple, but the diplomatic high priest D'Marke skillfully talked his way out of any repercussions from the city.\n\nMore troubling was the dispute that arose in the {{YearlinkName|1370}} when a flying machine built by the priests of [[Gond]] at [[The Turning Wheel]] ran afoul of the temple's wards and crashed, damaging The Hall of Mystery, for which the Gondar were obliged to pay damages.<ref> This in turn led to a property rights issue with the city as to whether the Mystrans owned the airspace above their temple, and a souring of the relationship between the two temple's clergies.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were persistent rumors that the underground levels of The Hall of Mystery were filled with exotic magic items, but also tales that all who attempted to confirm those rumors suffered ill fates.",
        "Inhabitants": "* Lord of Mystery [[Chester D'Marke]]: high priest\n* Lady [[Pamela Anne Legere]]: noblewoman and prophet\n* [[Derry Hlamae]]: temple seneschal\n* Advisor [[Monique D'Starre]]: Azuthan advisor to the high priest"
