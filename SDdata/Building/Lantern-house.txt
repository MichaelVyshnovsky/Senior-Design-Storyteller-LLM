The Lantern-house was a lighthouse found in the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands.
The lighthouse was built upon a thin peninsula that jutted into the Lake of Mists just north of Almorel. The peninsula was actually part of a larger submerged reef that posed a threat to incoming vessels.
The Lantern-house was run by Kiros Iskin who also lived within the structure.
