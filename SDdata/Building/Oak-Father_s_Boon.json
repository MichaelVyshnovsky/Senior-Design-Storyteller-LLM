        "mainbody": "'''Oak-Father's Boon''' was a well-known inn in [[Mosstone]] in [[Tethyr]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by Father [[Olondar Rajarn]].",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The best inn in Mosstone in the late 1360s DR, the Boon often attracted well-off inhabitants of the town and even many [[druid]]s of the [[Great Oak of Mosstone|Great Oak]] (including the Archdruid) and it was also the favorite establishment of [[Jordy Gallum]], the Count of [[Greenshores]] and former constable of Mosstone. The lush greenery and relaxed atmosphere attracted even an occasional [[elf]] from the [[Forest of Tethir]].\n\nHighsun meals were arguably the most popular at the Boon. The dining rooms were often thoroughly packed, with only standing space available for latecomers. Due to high demand, the inn recommended those guests who rented rooms to order highsunfeast delivered straight into their lodgings or to dine in the upper-floor lounges."
        },
        "Services": "The inn's prices were steep, but it had quality to match.\n\nApart from lodgings, the Boon offered a complementary array of chilled juices and freshly brewed [[tea]]s, as well as [[nut]]s and fresh [[biscuit]]s filled with [[berries]].\n\nEach meal was priced at only one [[gold coin]], and the amount of food served was virtually unlimited, leaving anyone stuffed and satiated. Served meals could be adjusted to satisfy every client's whims and desires.\n\nThe menu was refreshed seasonally. Some of the items that the Boon offered were delicate savory [[salmon]] and [[prawn]] [[tart]]s, [[spicy]] [[carrot]] and [[ginger]] soup, [[mint]]-flavored [[wine]] [[sausage]]s, and the most tender [[lamb]] shanks, cooked to perfection. The main specialty dish of note was a [[bowl of hares]].\n\nDuring [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s visit, eveningfeast dishes on the menu included [[garlic]]-sauced and smoked [[lamb kidneys]] and crispy roasted [[duck]]. Highsun meals consisted of grilled [[leek]]s and handfuls of small [[olive oil crust pie]]s, popular among merchants who purchased them in abundance to snack on the road.",
        "Inhabitants": "The inn belonged to a pleasant elderly [[cleric]] of [[Eldath]], Father [[Olondar Rajarn]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. He was known for his kindness and was considered a friend by all residents of Mosstone. The staff of the Boon were just as friendly and attentive as the old priest."
