        "mainbody": "ak-Fathers Boon was a well-known inn in Mosstone in Tethyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was owned by Father Olondar Rajarn.\nThe inn had numerous round rooms and dimly lit main halls, which were split into lower dining halls and upper-floor lounges. All were lavishly decorated with flowers, plants, and strings of living garlands. The lounges had extremely comfortable chairs for the guests. Each guest room had an elegant bed and comfortable dining table for those who preferred room service to the bustle of dining halls.\nThe best inn in Mosstone in the late 1360s DR, the Boon often attracted well-off inhabitants of the town and even many druids of the Great Oak (including the Archdruid) and it was also the favorite establishment of Jordy Gallum, the Count of Greenshores and former constable of Mosstone. The lush greenery and relaxed atmosphere attracted even an occasional elf from the Forest of Tethir.\nHighsun meals were arguably the most popular at the Boon. The dining rooms were often thoroughly packed, with only standing space available for latecomers. Due to high demand, the inn recommended those guests who rented rooms to order highsunfeast delivered straight into their lodgings or to dine in the upper-floor lounges.\nThe inns prices were steep, but it had quality to match.\nApart from lodgings, the Boon offered a complementary array of chilled juices and freshly brewed teas, as well as nuts and fresh biscuits filled with berries.\nEach meal was priced at only one gold coin, and the amount of food served was virtually unlimited, leaving anyone stuffed and satiated. Served meals could be adjusted to satisfy every clients whims and desires.\nThe menu was refreshed seasonally. Some of the items that the Boon offered were delicate savory salmon and prawn tarts, spicy carrot and ginger soup, mint-flavored wine sausages, and the most tender lamb shanks, cooked to perfection. The main specialty dish of note was a bowl of hares.\nDuring Volothamp Geddarms visit, eveningfeast dishes on the menu included garlic-sauced and smoked lamb kidneys and crispy roasted duck. Highsun meals consisted of grilled leeks and handfuls of small olive oil crust pies, popular among merchants who purchased them in abundance to snack on the road.\nThe inn belonged to a pleasant elderly cleric of Eldath, Father Olondar Rajarn, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was known for his kindness and was considered a friend by all residents of Mosstone. The staff of the Boon were just as friendly and attentive as the old priest."
