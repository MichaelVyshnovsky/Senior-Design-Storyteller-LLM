Wiston Apothecary was a shop located in Daggerford that sold all manner of curative items, such as herbs and potions. It was run by the master apothecary Wiston, who originally hailed from the city of Yartar.
The shop was located in northern Daggerford along Wall Street near the Farmers Gate.
In addition to selling goods of a restorative nature, Wiston employed a number of apprentices from the Physicians Order to further his studies.
While Wiston himself did a fair amount of experimentation and alchemical discovery he also took credit for the findings uncovered by his subordinates.
