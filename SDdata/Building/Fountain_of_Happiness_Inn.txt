The Fountain of Happiness Inn was the largest inn found in the city of Manass in Khazari.
Located near the Jade Gate, the inn was complete with a full courtyard, stable and additional guest houses located around a Shou-style garden.
The Fountain of Happiness catered to the many caravans passing through the city. The city guards of Manass were given free meals to ensure their prompt attention with dealing with local thieves.
Ba Salnang was the inns owner.
