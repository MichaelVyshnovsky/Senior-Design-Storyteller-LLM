The Oar and Wagonwheel Inn was an inn in the city of Elturel in the Western Heartlands in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Poor but cheap, it was the exception to the generally quality Elturian inns, yet it was always packed with patrons. It was crowded, noisy and raucous, and a resembled a drafty barn.
As Lord Dhelt decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, the Oar and Wagonwheel was expressly an inn.
