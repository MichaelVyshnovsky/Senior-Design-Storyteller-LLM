The Dragons Bower was an inn that stood along a road east of the city of Shamph in Chondath in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, The Dragons Bowers innkeep was Tchond Tchar. Tchond worked closely with the undercover Harper agent Eldorn who infiltrated the Chondathan cell of the Cult of Tiamat. Those allies who needed to contact Eldorn had to leave a coded message with Tchond Tchar at The Dragons Bower, according to Elminster Aumar.
