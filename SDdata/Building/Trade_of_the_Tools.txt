Trade of the Tools was a shop in Daggerford that specialized in selling all manner of tools and household items in the late 15 century DR. It was owned by the individualistic man known as Old Ander.
The shop was located in Daggerfords Money Quarter.
Trade of the Tools was nothing short of an absolute mess.
The massive building was full of all manner of items, from broken and near-useless furniture, to functional and practical hand tools. Old Ander bought all manner of items, reconditioned and repaired them if necessary, and rented or sold them to his customers.
