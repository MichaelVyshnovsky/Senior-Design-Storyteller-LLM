The Allfaiths Shrine was a non-denominational, wayside shrine in the village of Red Larch.
The shrine was situated on the western side of the Long Road, south of the Swinging Sword Inn.
The shrine was constructed of stone and said to resemble a grand mansion. At its entrance were two wide wooden doors, each painted with the holy symbols of numerous gods.
The interior of the shrine was rather plain and had a simple stone altar. In the back of the shrine were two rooms for visiting priests to sleep in.
The temples in Waterdeep regularly arranged for priests of two different faiths to commute to the shrine for month-long stays, who would bring their own vestments and holy items with them. The most typical temple pairings were Sune and Selune, Tymora and Lathander, and Tempus and Oghma.
In 1491 DR, Imdarr Relvaunder a priest of Tempus and Lymmura Auldarhk an acolyte of Sune were serving at the shrine. The latter was a regular at the shrine for many decades, officiating countless marriages and becoming beloved by the locals.
Around that same time, a priestess from the Shrine of Luck named Garaele decided to become an intendent at the shrine after having received some visions.
