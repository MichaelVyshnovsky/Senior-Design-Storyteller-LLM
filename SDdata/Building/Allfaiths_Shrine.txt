The '''Allfaiths Shrine''' was a non-denominational, wayside shrine in the village of [[Red Larch]].

==Location==
The shrine was situated on the western side of the [[Long Road]], south of the [[Swinging Sword Inn]].

==Structure==
The shrine was constructed of stone and said to resemble a grand mansion. At its entrance were two wide wooden doors, each painted with the [[holy symbol]]s of numerous gods.

==Interior==
The interior of the shrine was rather plain and had a simple stone altar. In the back of the shrine were two rooms for visiting [[priest]]s to sleep in.

==Activities==
The temples in [[Waterdeep]] regularly arranged for priests of two different faiths to commute to the shrine for month-long stays, who would bring their own vestments and holy items with them. The most typical temple pairings were [[Sune]] and [[Selune]], [[Tymora]] and [[Lathander]], and [[Tempus]] and [[Oghma]].

==Inhabitants==
In [[1491 DR]], [[Imdarr Relvaunder]] a priest of Tempus and [[Lymmura Auldarhk]] an [[acolyte]] of Sune were serving at the shrine. The latter was a regular at the shrine for many decades, officiating countless marriages and becoming beloved by the locals.

Around that same time, a priestess from the [[Shrine of Luck]] named [[Garaele]] decided to become an intendent at the shrine after having received some visions.
