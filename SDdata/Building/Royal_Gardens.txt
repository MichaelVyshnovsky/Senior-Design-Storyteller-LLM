The Royal Gardens were gardens around the royal palace of Castle Obarskyr in Suzail, Cormyr.
The gardens were located on the slope of a hill away from the city itself.
Around 376 DR, the gardens consisted of orchards of apples, peaches, and pear trees. All were arranged in rows with banks of lilies, marigolds, primroses, a hedge maze, a white gazebo, and a collection of statues, some from Myth Drannor.
