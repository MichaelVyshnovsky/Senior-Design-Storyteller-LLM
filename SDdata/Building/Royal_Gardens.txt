The '''Royal Gardens''' were gardens around the royal palace of [[Castle Obarskyr]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]].

==Geography==
The gardens were located on the slope of a hill away from the city itself.

==Structure==
Around [[376 DR]], the gardens consisted of orchards of [[apple]]s, [[peach]]es, and [[pear]] trees. All were arranged in rows with banks of lilies, marigolds, primroses, a hedge maze, a white gazebo, and a collection of statues, some from [[Myth Drannor]].
