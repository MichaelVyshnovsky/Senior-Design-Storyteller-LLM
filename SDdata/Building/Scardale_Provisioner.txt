The '''Scardale Provisioner''' was a high-quality general store located in the town of [[Scarsdeep]] within [[Scardale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Originally located in [[Scardale Town]], the shop's owner, [[Shaliana Ghend]], moved the location shortly after the [[second inter-dale war]] in [[1356 DR]]. This allowed Shaliana to provide her goods for the country folk of the dale, though bandit attacks caused her attach a 30% markup to her prices. In [[1367 DR]], the shop in Scardale Town was re-opened by Shaliana's daughter [[Talana]], and it quickly became well-stocked via regular shipments from Scarsdeep.
