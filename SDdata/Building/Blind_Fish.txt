The '''Blind Fish''' was a rowdy tavern close to the edge of [[Sarguth]] in the Dredge area of [[Skullport]].

==Interior==
The Blind Fish served strong alcohol and food. The tavern was well-furnished and filled with neer-do-wells who often started fights and were ready to gut someone for [[coin]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the bartender of Blind Fish was an aging male [[orc]] with a long white beard and an eyepatch.

==History==
Sometime in the 1490s DR, a [[halfling]] [[thief]], and an unwilling agent of [[Laeral Silverhand]] found himself in the tavern Blind Fish on his quest to recover the missing baby [[griffon]] stoled from the Open Lord by the [[Xanathar]]. Most regulars of the tavern were loyal to the master of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild|Thieves' Guild]] and attacked the halfling once he started asking questions about the guild. [[Fundunsun]], [[Heleen]], and [[Ssslasssh]] were part of the scuffle.
