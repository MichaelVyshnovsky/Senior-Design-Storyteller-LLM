The '''Elemental Store''' was an ingredients supply shop in [[Eileanar]] that was owned and operated by [[Navailles]] and [[Urquiza]] up to the fall of [[Netheril]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.

==Services==
The Store sold an array of completely pure chemical substances for use in [[alchemy]], as [[material component]]s in the [[spell]]s of [[wizard]]s, and other precise purposes. Depending on the material, they could be obtained in gaseous or liquid forms, though most were in solid bricks or powders. The prices were generally proportional to the weight of the material.
