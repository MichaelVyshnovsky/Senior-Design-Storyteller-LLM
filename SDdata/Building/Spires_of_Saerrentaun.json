        "mainbody": "The '''Spires of Saerrentaun''' was one of the “great towers” – the tallest buildings in the city of [[Iriaebor]], [[Elturgard]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The Spires of Saerrentaun was arguably the tallest structure in Iriaebor – counting twenty-six floors. It stood twice as tall as [[Malraunspires]] and [[Brevveskgates]], and was almost as wide as [[Immurtalan Towers]]. The Spires of Saerrentaun had reception rooms, warehouse, and tower stables on the first floor, followed by soaring rooms-of-state, granaries, pantries, and kitchens on the second. The next five floors were dedicated to house offices of the Saerrentaun family's numerous businesses; most had their own balconies. Above them were workshops, laundries, and servants' quarters. Finally, family chambers took the top floors with rooftop gardens with pennant-spikes and dovecote spires darting even higher up into the sky.",
        "History": "The Spires of Saerrentaun was home of the [[Saerrentaun|House Saerrentaun]], a noble family of Iriaebor, uplifted to that status by the family's patriarch – [[Halthandrus Saerrentaun]], sometime in the 15{{th}} century DR. The towers of House Saerrentaun rivaled in size and height with towers that belonged to the family's bitter rivals – [[Malraun|House Malraun]] and [[Brevvesk|House Brevvesk]]. Each of these three families' homes were equal in girth and the number of floors, rising high above Iriaebor. The [[Immurtalan|House Immurtalan]] was the fourth family that agreed to have the highest tower in the city. However, the number of floors among all four abodes was highest in the Spires of Saerrentaun."
