        "mainbody": "The Spires of Saerrentaun was one of the “great towers” – the tallest buildings in the city of Iriaebor, Elturgard, in the late 15 century DR.\nThe Spires of Saerrentaun was arguably the tallest structure in Iriaebor – counting twenty-six floors. It stood twice as tall as Malraunspires and Brevveskgates, and was almost as wide as Immurtalan Towers. The Spires of Saerrentaun had reception rooms, warehouse, and tower stables on the first floor, followed by soaring rooms-of-state, granaries, pantries, and kitchens on the second. The next five floors were dedicated to house offices of the Saerrentaun familys numerous businesses most had their own balconies. Above them were workshops, laundries, and servants quarters. Finally, family chambers took the top floors with rooftop gardens with pennant-spikes and dovecote spires darting even higher up into the sky.\nThe Spires of Saerrentaun was home of the House Saerrentaun, a noble family of Iriaebor, uplifted to that status by the familys patriarch – Halthandrus Saerrentaun, sometime in the 15 century DR. The towers of House Saerrentaun rivaled in size and height with towers that belonged to the familys bitter rivals – House Malraun and House Brevvesk. Each of these three families homes were equal in girth and the number of floors, rising high above Iriaebor. The House Immurtalan was the fourth family that agreed to have the highest tower in the city. However, the number of floors among all four abodes was highest in the Spires of Saerrentaun."
