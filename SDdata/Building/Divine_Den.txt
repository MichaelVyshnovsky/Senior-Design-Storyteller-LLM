The '''Divine Den''' was a temple of [[Malar]] in the small village of [[Bezentil]], considered to be the most holy sites of worship for the Beastlord in all the Realms. It was considered the center of the Malarite faith for the entirety of the [[Eastern Heartlands]] and [[Northeast Faerûn|eastern lands]] north of [[Thay]].

==Activities==
Clergy of the Divine Den would lead great hunting expeditions to the more exotic and dangerous locales of [[Faerûn]] in order to hunt down its most exotic prey.

Despite the belief there were few skilled smiths in Bezentil, twelve Malarite clergy members in the Divine Den were among the few that could forge the ''[[True Talons of the God]]'', specialized ''[[Claws of Malar]]'' that were [[item enchantment|enchanted]] and doused in the blood of beasts that were killed during their hunts.
