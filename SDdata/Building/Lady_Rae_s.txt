'''Lady Rae's''' was an [[inn]] exclusively for women found in the city of [[Saerloon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

==Location==
The inn was located near the center of Saerloon.

==Activities==
This establishment only allowed women, or those convincingly disguised as women, to enter. Lady Rae's was meant to be a place of relaxation where women could gather and enjoy a respite from crude comments and lecherous hands. However, some of the clientele of Lady Rae's could be just as rowdy and boisterous as men found in other inns.
