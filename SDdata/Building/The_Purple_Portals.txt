The Purple Portals was a temple and workshop devoted to Gond in Melvaunt, one of the oldest temples in all of Melvaunt.
The temple was found near the center of the city.
The primary function of the temple was to research and develop improved methods of processing and packaging. Though they also worked to research new methods of construction, insulation, and waterproofing.
An impressive laboratory was used to modify specialized machines.
The temple was held in quite high regard as their research efforts would ultimately benefit the populace as a whole. It also attracted many Gondar pilgrims, particularly gnomes.
The priests of this temple had access to the Gondar artificer Ikathilos laboratory in Mechanus.
