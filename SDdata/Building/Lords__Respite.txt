The '''Lords' Respite''' was a tomb located within the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
The Lords' Respite was located in the southern section of the City of the Dead.

==Description==
The small tomb was made from black [[marble]]. Statues of famous [[Open Lord]]s of Waterdeep faced all sides of the tomb with the exception of the western face. A door made from a mysterious material prevented anyone from seeing or passing through the opening.

==History==
The Lords' Respite was reserved for any Lords of Waterdeep who wished to be buried there, though only a single Lord had been buried here within the past several decades as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. The identities of all Lords buried within the tomb remained a secret.
