Faelfarils Inn was one of the oldest and least comfortable inns in Bryn Shander.
Many small holes in the walls let the chill air in, cutting the wind chill factor but otherwise leaving the inside barely warmer than the outside.
The inn was originally built by newcomers who hadnt spent a winter in Icewind Dale.
