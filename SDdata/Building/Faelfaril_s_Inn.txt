'''Faelfaril's Inn''' was one of the oldest and least comfortable inns in [[Bryn Shander]].

==Description==
Many small holes in the walls let the chill air in, cutting the wind chill factor but otherwise leaving the inside barely warmer than the outside.

==History==
The inn was originally built by newcomers who hadn't spent a winter in [[Icewind Dale]].
