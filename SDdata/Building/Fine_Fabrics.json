        "Services": "Fine Fabrics did business with the Upper City [[patriar]]s and city governors, outfitting them with quality finery. The shop's services were available in exchange for [[coin]] or letters of credit.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Gerard Densim]], the proprietor of Fine Fabrics, did business with [[the Guild]], paid for the organization's thugs to stand guard over the shop, protecting it from the dreaded [[Stone Lord]], a new kingpin allied with the [[Cult of the Absolute]]. As the guild war grew more severe, The Guild Bursar [[Uktar (The Guild)|Uktar]] raised the protection tithes. If unpaid, the guard would be withdrawn from Fine Fabrics. Gerard wrote a politely pleading letter stating he could not afford the guard to be removed and asked if it would be a good compromise for the Guild to accept a letter of credit from Fine Fabrics in addition to a twenty-percent discount for the Guild's guard (so they could look presentable while standing guard) and a fifty-percent discount to the guildmaster [[Nine-Fingers Keene]], the city's fifth and unforgotten duke."
