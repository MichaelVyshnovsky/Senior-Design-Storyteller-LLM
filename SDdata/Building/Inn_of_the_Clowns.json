The symbol of the inn was a battered sign of a clown juggling bottles of wine. The Inn of the Clowns was once renowned all throughout the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. The inn once housed grand entertainment and hospitality to traders far and wide, even rumored to attract the attention of nobility from far away. By the time of [[1357 DR]], this was no more. The war with the Kingdom of [[Vaasa]] had taken its toll on Bloodstone Village.<ref>"
