        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, Aki declared his restaurant to be the best in Aru, but so did his brother and business rival [[Tojo Marushima|Tojo]]. To settle the question, they each might've offered a group of adventurers a free meal, one night after the other, so they could serve as impartial judges. However, Tojo would pay a person to slip a mild purgative into their food when they dined at Aki's, which would cause them gastrointestinal problems during their adventures."
