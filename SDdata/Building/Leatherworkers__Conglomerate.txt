The Leatherworkers Conglomerate was the guildhall for the tanners in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The guildhall was located along Rogar Alley in western Daggerford near the Caravan Gate.
The guildhall was a three story building. Apprentices were allowed to stay on the second and third floors.
This was the best place to acquire leatherworks, specifically for armor and barding, within Daggerford.
