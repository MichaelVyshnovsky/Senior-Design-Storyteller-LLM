The '''Safe Haven''' was the inn of [[Darkenshield]], a [[Cormyr]]ean village in the [[Stonelands]]. It was destroyed along with the rest of the village in [[1352 DR]].

==Structure==
The inn was originally two stories, though by [[1369 DR]] the upper floor had collapsed in on itself. The nearby barn also remained mostly intact, though both structures were barely habitable. The internal walls of the inn were also largely destroyed, as the resident [[ogre]]s desired more open living space.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, Darkenshield was attacked by one of [[Gondegal]]'s units, the [[Twilight Brigade]]. The Safe Haven was not spared, and during the raid the twelve-year-old stableboy died trying to protect the [[horse]]s stabled in the barn.

By 1369 DR, the ruins were inhabited by a gang of eight ogres who found it a convenient camping spot. They redecorated the interior and defended the area from invaders, killing and eating one of Lord [[Vorik Aris]]'s agents when he attempted to scout out the ruins. They had amassed a small hoard of treasure in their time, including thousands of coins, a ''[[ring of elemental command]]'', a ''[[Murlynd's spoon]]'', a ''[[periapt of health]]'', and a ''[[Quaal's feather token]]''.
