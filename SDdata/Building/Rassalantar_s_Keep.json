The Long Road traveled north of Waterdeep and passed the Keep Woods, which masked the location of the ruins. \nWithin the dungeon was a permanent teleportation circle that was used by Rassalantar to communicate with the Blackstaff.\nAs of the , it was ruined and occupied only by tramps, doppelgangers, and other monsters.\nAround this time, the caravan stop village of Rassalanter, sprung up east of the ruined keep.\nOver the next century, most of the keeps stones were dissembled and used for construction in nearby settlements. All that was left was the underground cellar and dungeons, both of which had flooded."
