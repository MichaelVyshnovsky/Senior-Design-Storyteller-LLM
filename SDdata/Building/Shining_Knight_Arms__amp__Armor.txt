Shining Knight Arms & Armor was an armory shop located in Neverwinter in the 14 century DR.
It was located to the southwest of the House of Knowledge, in the City Core district.
The Shining Knight was one of the best armories in Neverwinter, because its owner was a wizard who knew spells to help him to shape metal, and who also worked with dwarves to create good weapons and armor.
