        "mainbody": "The Sword Tables Dining Lounge was a fine restaurant located on the ground floor of the Singing Sword Inn within the Temple District of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. It was a quiet eatery, that featured discreet booths and simple, but quite tasty, dishes served by an attendant and deft staff.\nThe main attraction within the Sword Tables were a selection of soups and stews, but the they offered some of the more-commonly roasted meats and selection of beer and ale. The mixed-meat skewers, which included boar, lamb, rabbit and quail, each served with mustard, gravy and/or mint jelly, were highly recommended among local Ravenians. Desserts included iced fruit and tasty cordials."
