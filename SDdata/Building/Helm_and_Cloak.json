        "Description": "Its signboard consisted of a weathered cloak draped over an exterior balcony on one side and an enormous helm hanging over the door on the other. The helm was said by staff, not altogether seriously, to have once been worn by a [[titan]].",
        "Architecture & Decor": "[[File:Helm and cloak.png|thumb|''The Helm and Cloak.'']]\nThe inn actually consisted of two connected buildings. The larger structure, known as ''the Helm'', was an old rooming house that faced the [[Hall of Wonders]], whereas the smaller of the two, ''the Cloak'', was an old personal residence that faced onto [[Windspell Street]] at the crossroads near the [[Ducal Palace]].[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]] dscribes the ''Cloak'' as the larger rooming house and the ''Helm'' as the smaller personal house. In [[Murder in Baldur's Gate]] these are reversed.\n\nThe Helm was so named because an enormous [[iron]] [[helmet]] hung above its doors. According to the staff it was said to have been once worn by an actual [[titan]]\n\nThe smaller house, called the Cloak, was once the residence of a priestess of [[Sune]], and as such its ceilings were painted with numerous scenes of passion and rampant pleasure. These drew more than a few raised eyebrows over the years, but never any actual complaints. The furnishings in both buildings were traditional and elegant, somehow managing to avoid being gaudy and overdone. The Cloak's interior decor was widely considered a paradigm of informal good taste.",
        "Patronage": "The Helm was much favored by individuals of power in Baldur's Gate, including the city's [[patriar]]. Numerous alliances and business deals had been negotiated in its dining alcoves. Its clientele largely fell into two categories: locals coming to dine in the feast hall and well-to-do travelers coming to enjoy the elegant accommodations.\n\nThere was an entire floor set up for long-term occupancy, largely occupied by the Knights of the Unicorn. These Knights were romantic adventurers, commonly described as \"elegant buffoons\". They made pleasant if slightly absurd company for any patron with good manners and a sense of humor.",
        "Provender": "The Helm's cuisine was served in generous platters suitable for several ordinary people. Dishes such as candied meats, jellied [[eel]]s, fresh [[fish]] in hot [[Lemon tree|lemon]] sauce, and glazed and stuffed fowl with fried onion-and-spiced-tubers stuffing were representative of the menu at large and were delicious. Most dishes were cooked in [[wine]].\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = A senior servant to Volothamp Geddarm on the issue of beers.\n| text   = We're ''not'' running a tavern, m'lord\n}}\nThe inn's wine cellar was vast, both in variety and in quantity.

        "Service": {
            "Prices": "Prices of food and services ''circa'' [[1367 DR]]:\n* Mead and milk were 5 [[cp]]/glass.\n* Wine was 3 [[gp]]/tallglass, 10 gp/greatgoblet (a huge [[silver]] flagon, containing as much as a bottle), or 25 gp/hand cask.\n* All platters of food were 10 gp each.\n* 50 [[gp]]/barrel, but only to long-term residents like the Knights of the Unicorn\n* Rooms ranged from 17–25 gp/night, depending on size and location.\n* Stabling costed an extra 3 gp/night/animal (the Helm was noted for providing the finest-quality hostlers)."

        "History": "In the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Helm and Cloak was a favored locale for adventuring companies. Among them were [[Gorpel Hind]] and his [[Band of Merry Fools]] along with the [[Maulers of Undermountain]].\n\nSometime before the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the adventurer [[Vail]] stashed the ''[[helm of Balduran]]'' away within the Helm and Cloak, hidden behind a painting on the second floor.\n\nDuring the 15{{th}} century, the inn was run by a husband-and-wife team from [[Cormyr]], [[Vedren]], and [[Halesta]]. Unbeknownst to many, they were both former Knights of the Unicorn.",
        "Rumors": "Rumors persisted of elegantly furnished garret chambers reached by secret passages, though the staff declined to answer questions about them. However, it was not unknown for infamous guests to be swiftly moved out of sight, and sometimes never sighted again. [[Elminster]] hinted that some of these chambers contained magical tapestries that themselves held ''[[gate]]''s to other, unknown locations in [[Faerûn]].\n\nThere were also legends of treasure hidden beneath the rooming-house building—attributed to long-ago pirates, naturally."
