century DR.
Castle Never, also known as the Keep of Lord Never, was the stronghold and home of the rulers of Neverwinter prior to the destruction of the city in the 15 century DR.
Castle Never was located in the western quadrant of the city inside of a sharp southward bend of the Neverwinter River just before it emptied into the harbor.
Before the Luskan invasion, Castle Never was considered to be part of the City Core, and after the war it was known as part of the Blacklake District. During the rebuilding efforts of the late years of the 15 century DR, the Castle was considered part of the Protectors Enclave.

The Castle was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the Ruining. Half of its towers crumbled, the western wall collapsed, and the courtyards were littered with toppled statues and chunks of fallen stone. Being built on an strong foundation, however, the rest of the castle was left mostly intact. however it would be cleared and largely rebuilt over the following years.
Castle Never in ruins as of the late 15 century DR.Castle Never was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the , with much of the structure collapsing or burning. All members of the Alagondar family were believed to have died during in the cataclysm, alongside almost anyone else who was inside the castle at the time. The ghosts of these many dead souls dwelt within the castle from then on, and although these spirits were not always hostile to intruders, they reacted violently to any perceived thief or pretender to the throne. and then to the Hall of Justice with the arrival of Dagult Neverember in the .
In the absence of any human inhabitants, Castle Never was home to only ghosts until territorial myconids evolved from fungal spores in the and ettercaps from the dungeons moved up to claim the ruins, led by a self-described "prophet" called Ryxfith. Then, Valindra Shadowmantle and her undead Thayan forces arrived, driving the ettercaps into the upper floors and remaining towers. In the meantime, Valindra began using the depths of the Neverneath as a lair for her dracolich, Azharzel, starting in the .
Finally, that same year, adventurers in service to Neverwinter launched a raid on Castle Never intending to oust Valindra once and for all. They successfully fought their way through her undead forces and a giant spider pet, defeated the beholder Talgath, and slew the dracolich Azharzel. This broke Valindras hold on the castle, but it still remained a haunted and undead-infested ruin.&mdashefforts to begin clearing the castle began, but were immediately stymied by demons and the apparent appearance of Orcus within its depths, along with a reanimated Talgath and an illithilich known as Cthylarr.
By the , despite Castle Never still being a dangerous ruin, Lord Protector Dagult Neverember had publicly announced plans to restore it in hopes of bringing prosperity to Neverwinter,
As of the , rebuilding efforts were still ongoing, and the restoration of Castle Never had become Neverembers highest priority. By that year, an area beneath the castle had been made into a prison&mdashcalled "the holes" by locals&mdashwhere those sentenced to death by Neverember were imprisoned. This included Oppal DeScart, a doppelganger working for Acquisitions Incorporated, who was wrongfully arrested when an orc she was impersonating was witnessed committing a murder.

It also became home to the newly ascended Lord of Neverwinter, Forge Fitzwilliam, along with his foster daughter Kira and his advisor Sofina.
During his reign, Forge Fitzwilliam reintroduced the deadly High Sun Games, and proposed to use Castle Nevers secure vaults to house the enormous amounts of wealth brought into town by rich individuals to gamble on the Games, including Porb Piiradost from Waterdeep and Din Caldwell of Baldurs Gate. However, the Castles defenses were relatively easily evaded by Forges former allies, the thieves Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, Simon Aumar, and their ally Doric. First, the druid Doric used her wild shape ability to scout the Castle&mdashinfiltrating it as a fly before escaping as a rat and eagle&mdashand subsequently the thieves mounted a heist by distracting the exterior guards with an illusion, battling the interior guards by luring them into the armory, and disabling the vaults arcane seal of Mordenkainen with the helm of disjunction. However, this led them to discover that Forge had plotted all along to simply steal the accumulated wealth in the vault, and had already transferred it to a secret dock beneath the Neverwinter arena to be secreted out of the city by ship. The intruders were ultimately captured by Sofina with the use of the spell Evards black tentacles, and sentenced to fight in the High Sun Games.
It was believed that some survivors of the destruction of Neverwinter had hid the treasures of the Alagondar family in secret rooms and vaults that were magically protected and would only open to a true heir of the Alagondar bloodline. although this item was subsequently obtained and concealed by Dagult Neverember in the .
Prior to the Ruining, Castle Never was home to the Alagondar royal family, their faithful servants, and their court. Even during this time, however, monsters such as ettercaps still infested the Neverneath. 
In the later years of the 1470s DR, the drow adventurers Drizzt DoUrden and Jarlaxle had established a camp concealed within the ruined courtyard of the castle, where they rested when they were in the area. This camp eventually began to attract locals who wished to learn from the two masters, and by 1479 DR, this suddenly turned into a haven for young thrill-seekers wishing to train in combat and perhaps explore the ruins without either drow needing to be present. Upon discovery of this group of fans, Jarlaxle sent an agent of Bregan Daerthe, a magically disguised drow named Xalbyn, to keep an eye on them. Jarlaxles partner, Kimmuriel Oblodra, likewise sent his own agent, a half-drow psion named Aerlyse, to keep an eye on Xalbyn.
In the late 1470s DR, a clan of gnolls led by a minotaur began exploring the Neverneath, only to become trapped by its malign magics. They established a makeshift home within the castles dungeons as they searched for an exit, but were soon crazed by hunger and hunted anything that joined them in the catacombs.
