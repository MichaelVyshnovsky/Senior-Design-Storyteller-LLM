and 14 century DR
The House of Alastrin was a temple dedicated to Milil, known for displaying one of the exceedingly rare holy books of the "Lord of All Songs".
The temple was located at the feet of the Cloven Mountains.
During the 10 century DR, Wythyndles Round Book was bestowed by Milil to a blind bard singing his praises on a mountaintop of the eastern Cloven Mountains. The bard was then carried down to the temple to bring news of this holy gift.
Wythyndle and the book stayed at the temple until his death during the winter of 996 DR. After the death of the bard, the book magically disappeared for the first time.
