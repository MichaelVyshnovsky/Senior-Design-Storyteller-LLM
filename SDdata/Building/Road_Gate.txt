The Road Gate was the main, and only, gate leading into the city of Yhaunn in 1358 DR.
The Road Gate was located in the northwest section of the city.
The gate straddled the East Way as it passed into the city, sitting atop the gully that fully encircled Yhaunn. A large castle known as Castle Narnbra, or the Roadkeep, was attached to the gate complex.
