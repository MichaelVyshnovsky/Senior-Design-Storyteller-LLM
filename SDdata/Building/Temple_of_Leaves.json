        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Leaves''' was a holy site dedicated to the head of the [[elven pantheon]], [[Corellon Larethian]], located in the outpost of [[New Sharandar]].",
        "Interior": "Located within its walls was a shrine formed out of a single living hedge. It was carefully shaped in a manner to hold and support the temple's holy documents and icons.\n\nLocated beneath the priests' quarters in the temple was a subterranean cellar that housed a secret shrine to [[Asmodeus]], [[archdevil]] and ruler of the [[Nine Hells]].",
        "Services": "While the priests of the Temple of Leaves devoted themselves to the worship of Corellon, they allowed for others to practice nearly any other faith they wished.",
        "Activities": "The Temple of Leaves' priests were considered as leaders among the community of [[Iliyanbruen]] elves of New Sharandar. They spent much of their time praying that their fellows would enjoy much success in their reclamation of the ancient ruins of fallen [[Illefarn]].\n\nThe priests' leader, [[Emrae Firesky]] was a fervent supporter of [[Olirien Mistcrown]], and his faction of elves that advocated for violence against the people of [[Neverwinter]] and the surrounding area.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Emrae Firesky]], head priest of the temple.\n* [[Addemios Three-Dawn]], Emrae's assistant and secret devotee of [[Asmodeus]].\n* [[Marril]], a priest who was amenable to working with non-elves."
