The '''Temple of Mystra''' was a secret place of worship dedicated to [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]].

==Location==
The small temple was located underground beneath an abandoned apartment building in western Bezantur. Several tunnels extended from the temple which could be used to quickly escape the city.

==Activities==
The temple served as a safe haven for the worship of Mystra, The underground complex also came to serve as a hiding place for other enemies of the Red Wizards, notably agents of the [[Harpers]], escaped slaves, and political dissidents.

==Defenses==
The temple was kept hidden by powerful [[ward]]s maintained by the temple's High Priestess. In addition, a vision of Mystra watched over the temple, and was believed by the faithful to be a manifestation of her divine power that kept the temple safe.

==History==
Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], the earlier incarnation of [[Mystra]] was openly venerated in Thay, although her worship was generally restricted to only Red Wizards and their entourages. During this time, Bezantur boasted the largest Thayan temple in her honor, although it was subordinate to a temple in [[Eltabbar]]. However, following the events of the Time of Troubles in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}&mdash;when Mystra's mantle was taken up by [[Midnight]]&mdash;her worship became outlawed in the City of a Thousand Temples in a bid by the Red Wizard's to limit access to [[arcane magic]] outside of their own organization. By the late 1360s DR, the [[church of Mystra]] operated mainly out of this hidden underground complex.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple and its wards were overseen by High Priestess [[Dolare]].
