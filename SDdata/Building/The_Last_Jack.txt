The Last Jack was an inn and a tavern located in the Shutters neighborhood of the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.
The Last Jack was located just past the Ravensbridge as one entered the Shutters from Shadystreets, on the crossing of the Stonekeep Concourse and Karen Court.
The Last Jack was known for its taproom and a calm and comfortable atmosphere, especially compared to nearby rowdy Salty Dog. The ground floor taproom was frequented by the City Watch, making it quite safe. The taproom was always lively but aggressive, loud and rowdy behavior resulted in the problem guests being removed from the inn. Above the taproom, the Last Jack had three floors of guest rooms for those looking rest rather than food and libations. The guest rooms were small and humble, with a single bed with a rope frame topped with a straw mattress and two wool blankets, a candle-lamp, a water-ewer with a cup, and a chamberpot.
The Last Jacks food and drink was lackluster watery beer, poor quality sausages, stale bread smothered in peppercorn butter. The inn also sold misshapen fried saltfish of unrecognizable species. However, tomato-and-onion chutney served at the inn was a truly good dish packed with hot-throat spices, useful to cover taste of other food here.
