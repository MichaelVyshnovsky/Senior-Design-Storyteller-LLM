The '''Viper Temple''' was an ancient mysterious structure that towered over the jungles of the [[Samarlogh]] on the [[Sanrach Mountains]].

==Location==
The nation of [[Samarach]] was separated from the [[Chultengar]] by the Sanrach Mountains. The Viper Temple menacingly sat on a mountain passage across, blocking the entire route, High above the jungles. The structure's two entrances opened to the south and to the north, allowing passage through when the temple ruins were not locked.

The Viper Temple held telltale signs and designs that indicated it was once used by the worshipers of [[Sseth]]. A black obelisk stood to the temple's southeast, along the mountain pass, and ruined columns dotted the sides of the passage towards the temple to the north.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, wealthy merchant [[Sa'Sani]]'s operations were disturbed, and she herself became targeted by the [[yuan-ti]] forces of the [[Snaketongue cult]] that venerated an interloper deity [[Zehir]]. The cultists drove Sa'Sani away from her operations and allies. She found shelter in the [[Viper Temple]], previously sealed tight. When [[Volothamp Geddarm]] and a group of mercenaries who partnered with the merchant followed the woman, she was attacked by assassins of the Snaketongue cult and the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Se'Sehen]]. After the assault led by a [[yuan-ti abomination]] [[Es'San]], Sa'Sani revealed to her trusted allies that she was a princess of the yuan-ti [[House Sauringar]]. She revealed that the Viper Temple was once her house's stronghold. Both Sa'Sani and Volothamp, who was quite smitten with the yuan-ti pureblood woman, remained in the [[Viper Temple]] while the band of mercenaries moved north to confront the servants of Zehir in the [[Temple of the World Serpent]].
