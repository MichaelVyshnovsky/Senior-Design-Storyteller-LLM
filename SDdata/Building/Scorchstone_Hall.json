        "mainbody": "Scorchstone Hall was a manor in Ripplestones during the midâ€“8 century DR that was home to the undead sorceress Sharindala.\nIt stood within Ripplestones, past a bridge and on a corner along the main road of the town.\nThe mansion had gardens, which were overgrown by the mid-700s DR. It had a tower at the eastern front corner, which had suffered the brunt of a fire, leaving most of the rest of the mansion untouched. The windows used shutters, not glass.\nDuring Elminster Aumars foray into the place, he found it greatly decayed, but confirmed it was regularly cleaned. There were sculptures, paintings, and books, even. There were shelves, tallchests, and bedrooms, complete with closets.\nBesides shuttered windows, and thick trees around it, there was a shimmering magical ward around the house that slew most of the birds, squirrels, and foxes that so much as brushed against it.\nSharindalas home burned after she died, sometime in the early 8 century DR.The fire happened when the wizard Caladaster was but a child as he was elderly by , this was most likely earlier in the 700s DR. In the , the Chosen of Mystra entered the home to hide magic that others may find while in there, he was attacked by Sharindala, who struck him with a wand of magic missiles as he opened the closet in which she hid from the intruder. After that scare, he gave her a book of new spells.\nIt was said that Sharindala remained inside, active, and capable of slaying. This was more or less correct."
