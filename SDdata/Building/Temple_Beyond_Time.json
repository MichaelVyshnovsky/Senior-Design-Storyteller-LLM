        "mainbody": "The '''Temple Beyond Time''', also known as the '''Temple of Labelas''', was a temple to [[Labelas Enoreth]] the Lifegiver in the city of [[Mhiilamniir]] of the elven realm of [[Eaerlann]], lying within the [[High Forest]]. It had a strange relationship with the time-stream.",
        "Description": "It was a soaring tower in the form of an elongated [[hourglass]].",
        "Powers": "The name of the Temple Beyond Time was quite literal: a few hours might pass on the inside whilst many years flashed by outside. Furthermore, it could only be seen and accessed for a brief time at widely varying intervals.\n\nThe undercroft of the Temple of Labelas had a two-way ''[[portal]]'' to the [[House of Long Silences]] in [[Ardeep]].This article assumes that the Temple Beyond Time described in ''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' and the Temple of Labelas mentioned in ''[[Lost Empires of Faerûn]]''—both in Mhiilamniir and dedicated to Labelas—are one and the same. However, it is unclear how the presence of the ''portal'' (offering constant, easy access) would interact with the time-sensitive nature of the temple (preventing any easy or regular access). It may be that this ''portal'' only functions when the tower is present or that the undercroft does not disappear when the tower does.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple had only three permanent inhabitants: [[Susklahava Orbryn]], [[Roanmara Neirdre]], and [[Phantyni Evanara]], a trio of undying [[Siluvanede]]nn [[gold elf]] [[baelnorn]] priestesses known together as the Timespinners. They had served for millennia as historians, oracles, sages, and seers.",
        "Activities": "When the Temple Beyond Time was due to reappear, Labelas provided omens to his faithful and they interpreted these to determine the date. The faithful journeyed to the location and awaited the time when they could enter the tower and consult with the Timespinners. However, they took the risk of possibly re-emerging many years later.",
        "History": "The Temple Beyond Time was the oldest of the city's many temples; according to Labelasan religious texts, it had stood during the early history of [[Aryvandaar]], ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-23600}}.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], the [[green dragon]] [[Chloracridara]] laired in the ruined temple of [[Corellon Larethian]] in Mhiilamniir but claimed the whole city as her domain. This made it too hazardous for elven [[pilgrim]]s to visit any of the temples. Only the Temple Beyond Time escaped the dragon's attentions, thanks to its intermittent existence."
