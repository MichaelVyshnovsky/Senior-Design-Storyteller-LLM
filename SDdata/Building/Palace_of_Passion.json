        "Location": "[[File:Palace of Passion exterior map.png|thumb|''A map of Palace of Passion's exterior.''|285x285px]]\nThe temple was built in the Uptown District of Raven's Bluff, the [[Mortonbrace]] Neighborhood on [[Griffon Trail]]. Once visitors exited the temple's main doors, they could see [[DeVillars Creek]] running on the righthand side with a small bridge across it.{{Cite polyhedron/144/The Palace of Passion: Ravens Bluff's Temple of Sune|41}}",
        "Structure": "Palace of Passion included three structures. The main building was what the temple proper; it stood further away from Griffon Trail. Two smaller buildings were the infirmary, also used as a contemplation chamber, and the dormitory for the temple's clerics.\n\nThe Palace of Passion was surrounded by a green garden of pruned flowering fragrant [[tree]]s with a fountain depicting the goddess's face at the center. The statue of Sune poured water from a pitcher into the fountain's basin as crystal wind chimes serenely clinked. The gardens had several gazebos for those who sought privacy under the night sky.",
        "Interior": "[[File:Palace of Passion sub upper map.png|thumb|''A map of lower and upper levels of the Palace of Passion.''|285x285px]]\nThe temple's staircases, floors, and columns of pink [[marble]], all were exuberantly gilded. The columns stretched towards the Palace's dome carved out of red crystal. Even more crystal delicately jangled on numerous chandeliers that lit the temple's halls, chambers, and hallways with soft luminescence. The furniture and decorations were lavish; paintings, statuettes, and sculptures inspired awe, while fresh flower arrangements made the temple appear warm and welcoming.\n\nPast the main gates stood a richly decorated foyer with three giant crystal chandeliers and a grand staircase that led towards the Palace's ballroom. The room was propped up by ten columns and had two staircases that led to the temple's lower level and a large dining hall and storage areas. The ballroom was encircled by lofts on the upper level for guests to observe dances and celebrations, while on the other side of the lofts were three balconies overlooking the temple's wooded gardens. On the right side of the ballroom was a series of small chambers called the Bowers of Romance. Each of the rooms was filled with cushions and famous heated baths, with a series of dressing rooms and garderobes next to them.\n\nThe second-floor lofts housed musicians during festivals and had curved flying walkways – the Lovers' Walks, above the temple's sanctuary, used by lovers and for the clergy rituals. [[Sunite]]s believed that anyone who met on the Lovers' Walks was blessed by Lady Firehair herself.",
        "Activities": "[[File:High Priestess Morlain.png|thumb|''Two Heartwarders, Gregor Fenfrill and Candi Kane strolling through the streets of Ravens Bluff.''|370x370px]]\nThe members of the [[Church of Sune]] who ran the Palace of Passion maintained positive relationships with the clergy of [[Lliira]], [[Selûne]], [[Sheela Peryroyl]], and [[Hanali Celanil]]. However, rivalries still existed, especially when it came to beauty. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Palace of Passion had strained relationships with the [[Church of Sharess]] as the temple of Sharess in Ravens Bluff was used by cultists of devil lord Glasya. Despite the tension, the High Priestess of Sune, [[Morlain]] maintained an official declaration of friendship between the two churches. Palace of Passion had one more church in Ravens Bluss with whom it had strained relationships. The High Priest [[Relarn Dayspring]] of [[Church of Lathander]], and member of the [[Clerical Circle]] of Raven's Bluff campaigned against the Church of Sune being admitted as the civic religion of the city.\n\nDespite opposition, the Palace of Passion had many supporters, in part thanks to the Church's support of several civic programs in Ravens Bluff. One such program was The Body Beautiful, guided by the belief that a beautiful body was a healthy body. Clerics of Firehair tutored Ravenaar in the use of cosmetics, hair care, and styling, as well as taught them about diet and exercises. Other classes regularly held in the Palace of Passion were dedicated to clothes and jewelry. The classes were immensely popular among the noble youths. The temple of Sune also helmed the program to aid the homeless. Unfortunately, it was on hold for a year as the temple was being rebuilt.\n\nThe temple of Sune also put up lush revelries to celebrate several city-wide festivals. [[Greengrass]] was marked by a grand outdoor revelry; [[Midsummer Night]] celebration was dedicated to couples, both young and young at heart; [[Grand Revel]] celebration was a monthly event filled with a day and a night full of dancing, and lastly [[Feast of Love]] was the name given to weekly soirées for partners to consume delicate sweets and strong [[wine]].\n\nThe Palace of Passion owned a famed mountain resort called the [[Valley of Dolls]], two days' walk from Raven's Bluff. Only those personally invited by the clergy of Sune were allowed entrance.\n\nThe Palace of Passion followed the dogma outlined in the ''[[Love's Lessons]]'', a holy book of the Sunite faith. The temple's 14{{th}} century [[DR]] High Priestess, [[Morlain]] interpreted the teachings of the goddess as not narcissistic, like many believed, but as guidance to love and cherish oneself, to find parts of oneself that were beautiful, and that one cannot love another until one loves oneself. Morlain also advocated for raising children in love, good food, physical exercise, and plenty of sleep, as well as with good skincare.{{Cite polyhedron/144/The Palace of Passion: Ravens Bluff's Temple of Sune|42}}",
        "History": "[[File:Palace of Passion 2.png|thumb|''Embracing lovers on the Lovers' Walk.''|370x370px]]\nThe original Palace of Passion was destroyed in a fierce battle between the [[avatar]] of Sune and [[Baatezu]] [[Glasya]], the lord of [[Malbolge]] and daughter of [[Asmodeus]]. The heroic battle brought hordes of new worshipers to the goddess of beauty, and a mere year later, the temple was rebuilt through generous donations from rich artists, merchants, nobles, and social climbers.{{Cite polyhedron/136/City Stories: The Temple of Selûne|10}}\n\nOn the [[Mirtul 10|10{{th}} of Mirtul]], the same year as the temple's destruction, the Palace of Passion, aided by temples of Lliira, Sheela Peryroyl, and Hanali Celanil, hosted the first [[Annual Beautification Day]], a festival dedicated to improving one's looks. The first attempt did not reach desired popularity. However, the newly rebuilt temple had grand plans for the following celebration.",
