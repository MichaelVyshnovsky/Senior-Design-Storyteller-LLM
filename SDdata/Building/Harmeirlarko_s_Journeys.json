        "mainbody": "Harmeirlarkos Journeys was a wagon repair shop in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nHarmeirlarkos was located on the truncated point of the intersection between the North Way and Orntathtar Way. It faced north across the triple-wide intersection and out through Handrornlar, the northern gate through the walls of Khôltar. It was next door to Surlpars Stews, a convenient but low-quality blurdren (food counter) to the east,\nThis establishment was an enclosed compound  with a central courtyard. Entry was through a portcullis set into the stone wall that could be lowered to protect the cargo of wagons being stored there overnight.\nHarmeirlarko and his happy staff were expert wheelwrights, able to repair broken carriages, light carts, and heavy wagons, as well as build new ones from lumber and metal parts produced locally in the Iron City. Prices for new vehicles and repairs were quite high, but the quality was excellent and the work was completed quickly so traders could get back on the road as soon as possible. There were bargains to be had, but these were always the result of a trader or caravan master selling a damaged cart for whatever price they could negotiate as a trade-in toward buying one of Harmeirlarkos vehicles. The staff were skilled in dealing with upset or distraught merchants.\nHarmeirlarkos Journeys also sold spare wheels and axles to caravans in case of misfortune on the road. Veteran caravan drivers could make a good profit if they could sell their oldest spare parts to less fortunate merchants out on the trail.\nAnother service they offered was a heavy lifting capability by overhead crane. Only the staff was allowed to operate the cranes, but a  wagon load could be swiftly transferred from one vehicle to another with a few lifts and for little cost. They charged from one to five copper pieces per lift, usually at the whim of the staffer, and usually based on their judgement of the wealth of the customer."
