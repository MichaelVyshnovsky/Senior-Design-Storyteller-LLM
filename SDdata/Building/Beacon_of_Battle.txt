The '''Beacon of Battle''' was a temple dedicated to [[Tempus]] within the city of [[Calimport]].

==Location==
This temple was located in the Biteq [[Drudach]], in the [[Qhibal Sabban]], in the [[Calimport/Shackles Ward|Shackles Ward]] of Calimport.

==Structure==
This building was constructed of red-glazed bricks, stood two stories tall, and had an outward appearance similar to what many [[slavery|slaver]]s' houses looked like in [[Calimshan]]. Swung over the main ground-floor entrance was a [[silver]] emblem of Tempus.

==Activities==
Beyond their religious duties, the clergy of this temple would regularly seek out suitable candidates among the slave masses of Shackles Ward for recruitment as [[gladiator]]s for one of Calimport's arenas. Some slaves sought out the attention of these [[priest]]s for this, as arena slaves had a slight chance of winning their freedom.
