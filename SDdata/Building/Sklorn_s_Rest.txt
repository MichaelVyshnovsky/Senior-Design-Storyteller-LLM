'''Sklorn's Rest''' was a harbor on the isle of [[Sklorn]] in [[Sea of Swords]], just off the shores of [[Candlekeep]].

==Location==
Sklorn's Rest was a colloquial name given to Sklorn's main harbor. It was located on the island's southern shores, with two good anchorages on both sides of Sklorn's Rest. The harbor was surrounded by freshwater streams that tricked down the rocky elevation at the island's center.
