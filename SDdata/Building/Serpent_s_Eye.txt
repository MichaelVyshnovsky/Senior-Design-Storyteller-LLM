The Serpents Eye was an inn found in Zhentil Keep in 1358 DR.
The inn was located along Beholder Street in Zhentil Keeps Common Quarter in the southeast part of the city.
This huge inn leaked during inclement weather and was drafty throughout the year. A large gambling room was located in the basement. The naug-orls oversaw all gambling here. The Serpents Eye rented 37 rooms which were rarely empty despite the inns shabby appearance.
The Serpents Eye was a drafty leaking ruin of an inn. The inns prices were moderate but a bit too steep for the poor accommodations.
