        "mainbody": "'''The Sail at Sunset''' was a ramshackle dockside tavern in [[Tulmene]] of [[Tethyr]], frequented by old salts and rowdy sailors in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The tavern was known for its serversâ€”a surprisingly unattractive, warty bunch of farm lasses with tough bodies, more muscular than most warriors. These women were specifically hired for their looks by [[Kralbert Dightmaer]], who ran the establishment in the late 14{{th}} century DR, to avoid harassment of his employees by rowdy sailors.\n\nThe tavern was seldomly cleaned, and when it was cleaned it was by pushing drunkards across the floors and out of the door.\n\nNot surprisingly, bar fights were a regular occurrence, but they were always broken apart by a hose of saltwater pumped through from behind the tavern. The presence of three giant, muscled, thuggish bouncers armed with [[club]]s and [[whip]]s helped to persuade others against starting trouble. Smacking a troublemaker with a chair was another convincing argument.\n\nNo bard or minstrel performers ever showed up at the Sail at Sunset; however, hired table-dancers entertained the clientele after sundown."
        },
        "Services": "The Sail's [[beer]]s were watered down, and the only food on the menu were [[biscuit]]s, fried in [[butter]]. Occasionally, the tavern offered [[saltfish|salted]] [[eel]]s or [[squid]] when the proprietor was able to purchase a barrel-full for cheap. Each salted [[fish]] was sold as-is for two [[copper]]s \"per corpse,\" as Kralbert Dightmaer referred to the grub."
