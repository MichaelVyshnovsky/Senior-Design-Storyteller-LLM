'''Jendalar's Fine Fruits''' was a trading coster located in the city of [[Archenbridge]] in the latter half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They would buy produce from local farms and orchards in [[Archendale]] and ship them to the large cities in [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]].

The shop was name after its founder, but was later purchased by the merchant-mage [[Alduvar Snowbrand]]. Because Alduvar was secretly the [[Blue Sword]], he often left the shop in the care of his business partner, [[Selni Ravenhair]].
