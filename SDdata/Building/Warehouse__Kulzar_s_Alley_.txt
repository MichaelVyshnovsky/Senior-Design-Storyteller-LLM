This '''unnamed warehouse''' was a warehouse located on [[Kulzar's Alley]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
This building was adjoined to the buildings known as [[the Gildenfires]] and [[Roarke House]], being situated right between them.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], this warehouse and the buildings adjoining it were all owned by [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble family]] [[Neverember]]. Around this time it was leased longterm to the noble families [[Ammakyl]] and [[Gralleth]].

In [[Eleint]] of [[1479 DR]], an inspection of the warehouse found that half of it was filled with older furniture and decorations from three separate instances in which [[Jadzia Ammakyl]] decided that her mansion wasn't up to the latest Waterdhavians fashions and needed updating.

That autumn inspection also found that the other half of the warehouse was filled by the Gralleths with the belongings of noble villas the family had obtained after absorbing the interests and estates of the noble families [[Bladesemmer]] and [[Markarl]].
