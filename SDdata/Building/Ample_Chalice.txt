The Ample Chalice was a rowdy tavern found in the fabled city of Myth Drannor.
It was located at the intersection of Moonshadows Street and  Scatterhorn Street, in the Sheshyrinnam district of the city.
The Ample Chalice was one of the favorite haunts of the AkhVelahr.
The boisterous Arnarra Gildenguard won ownership of the tavern in a game of chance. It quickly garnered a lot of business, becoming the tavern of choice for Ilphas Miritar, son of the citys Lord-Speaker.
