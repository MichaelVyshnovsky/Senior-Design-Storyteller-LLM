Balivers House of Horses was a rental stable in Luskan. 
The stables consisted of a series of walled paddocks and sheds located at the south end of the Upstream Span.
The Arcane Brotherhood watched over the stables, which charged 4 gold pieces a night for each horse and took excellent care of the animals. The mages were known to use tracer spells on horses if they suspected they would need to track the owner.
As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it was the only rental stable in the city. It was used by all inhabitants and visitors to Luskan with the notable exception of Luskar soldiers, caravan companies, the High Captains, and members of the Arcane Brotherhood.
