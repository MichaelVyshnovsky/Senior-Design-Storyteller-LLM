'''Baliver's House of Horses''' was a rental stable in [[Luskan]]. 

==Location==
The stables consisted of a series of walled paddocks and sheds located at the south end of the [[Upstream Span]].

==Services==
The [[Arcane Brotherhood]] watched over the stables, which charged 4 [[gold piece]]s a night for each [[horse]] and took excellent care of the animals. The [[mage]]s were known to use ''[[tracer]]'' spells on horses if they suspected they would need to track the owner.

==History==
As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was the only rental stable in the city. It was used by all inhabitants and visitors to Luskan with the notable exception of Luskar soldiers, caravan companies, the [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captains]], and members of the Arcane Brotherhood.{{Cite digital book/The Companions/Kindle||26}}
