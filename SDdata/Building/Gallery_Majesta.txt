The Gallery Majesta was a museum and a temple to Deneir in the city of Calimport, one of a number of such locations in Calimshan.
The temple was located in Jemil Drudach of Jhaapir Sabban within Quill Ward.
The building was a three-story structure of excellent construction.
The first floor served as a temple. Visitors were not allowed to enter unless they also attended a prayer service or made a donation to the temple treasury.
The second floor was the museum, where a good number of impressive exhibits displayed magical artifacts. In truth, while the items on display were indeed magical, they were only copies of the true artifacts, which were stored deep in the vaults beneath the temple. The magics on the display items were tracking enchantments. Anyone who tried stealing an artifact could thus be easily found and summarily beheaded.
The entrance to the secret vault was hidden underneath the main altar on the first floor. The altar could be moved, providing access to a long series of winding stairs.
Third floor housed the Deneirrath who served at the temple.
