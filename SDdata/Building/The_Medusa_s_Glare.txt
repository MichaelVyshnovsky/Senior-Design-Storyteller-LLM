The Medusas Glare was a sculptors shop in the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.
This shop stood at the southern end of Slop Street, near the Jade Dancer, in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.
Inside the building was a secret room containing a portal to Harpers Hold.
Owned by a member of the Harpers, the Medusas Glare acted as a safe-house for that organization in addition to operating as a shop.
