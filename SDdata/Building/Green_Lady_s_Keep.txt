The Green Ladys Keep was a long, low temple to Chauntea in Velprintalar, Aglarond.
In 1368 DR, the abbey included a granary where twelve monks were led by Abbot Dalmar.In the 2nd edition sourcebook Spellbound, Dalmar is stated as being an abbot of a temple to Chauntea that specializes in brewing ale. Later in the 3rd edition Unapproachable East sourcebook, the abbey is called the "Green Ladys Keep".
By 1374 DR, the monks had increased in number to over one hundred.
The monks worked to produce a green ale said to include fermented parsley, which was one of the citys most popular exports.
