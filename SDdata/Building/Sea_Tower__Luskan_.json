        "mainbody": "The '''Sea Tower''' was the original pirate stronghold in the city of [[Luskan]].",
        "Location": "It sat atop a rocky height on the southside of [[Cutlass Island]] in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]].",
        "Structure": "The tower was a massive fortress of weathered stone blocks.  Its windows overlooked the sea below.",
        "Defenses": "While the Sea Tower had strong walls, it lacked any [[magic]]al fortifications. It served as a guard tower over the waters of Luskan, but was not designed to withstand a direct attack or bombardment.",
        "History": "The Sea Tower was erected by the first pirates who called Luskan home. It was built to defend the mouth of the River Mirar from invading [[ship]]s, and a garrison was maintained there by [[Ship Kurth]] through the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nBy the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, [[wizard]]s of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] who were not capable or powerful enough to be considered full-fledged members were housed in the Sea Tower, while the Brotherhood proper was headquartered at the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] on the northside of Cutlass Island. Those who aspired to join the Brotherhood were also directed to congregate at the Sea Tower, with as many as thirty hopefuls loitering in the area on any given day. The only others who dared travel to the Sea Tower were sellers of [[Material component|spell components]]. At night, the fortress was occasionally lit up by the flash of experimental [[spell]]s during this time.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, when [[Deudermont]] led an effort to unseat the Arcane Brotherhood's grip on Luskan, [[Kurth|High Captain Kurth]] elected to support Deudermont, and so withdrew the Sea Tower's garrison commander, [[Nehwerg]], Deudermont allies, led by the wizard [[Robillard]], proceeded to rain boulders down on the Sea Tower as well as all other Brotherhood defenses on the southside of Cutlass Island. The Sea Tower was badly damaged and had partially collapsed following the battle.\n\nThe tower, along with the rest of Cutlass Island, was abandoned for the following century until the return of the Arcane Brotherhood in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Inhabitants": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the Sea Tower was home non-spellcaster agents of the Arcane Brotherhood as well as about forty \"magelings\", who were unanimously evil and ambitious. They spent their days and nights experimenting with magic, occasionally erupting into duels that sent the mangled or ''[[polymorph]]ed'' bodies of the losers tumbling into the sea. These magelings were overseen by about a dozen full-fledged wizards."
