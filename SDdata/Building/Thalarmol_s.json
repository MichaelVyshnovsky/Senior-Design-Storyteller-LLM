        "mainbody": "halarmols was a business in Kholtar, south Faer√ªn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThalarmols was located on the south side of Hael Way between Halamors Sure Service and Elduskryns Fiery Creations, not far from Farrgaunlar (the southern gate out of Kholtar). Across the street was a klathlaaedin (fancy mansion) named Anthormbrur belonging to the Horthander family.\nThalarmols made generic and custom crates for shipping goods so they would withstand travel by caravan. They were in an advantageous location with Halamors next door, as customers used the delivery service to send items to Thalarmols."
