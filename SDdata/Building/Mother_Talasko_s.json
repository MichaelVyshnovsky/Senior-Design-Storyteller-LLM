        "mainbody": "'''Mother Talasko's''' was a busy blurdren (a food counter with little, if any, seating) located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. It was owned by the [[Khaundrove]]s, one of the twenty [[Onsruur]] families that formed the council of lords in the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|70}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 55: Khôltar, Part 6, Looking Around the Farrgaunlar}}",
        "Location": "This blurdren was located at the east end of [[Raelrur's Run]] on the north corner with the nameless lane that circled the city just inside the walls. Raelrur's Run branched off of the [[North Way]] very close to Farrgaunlar, the southern gate into Khôltar.",
        "Services": "Mother Talasko's was staffed by eight foul-tempered [[dwarves]] that all looked like they had former careers in the criminal underground or were the surviving casualties of one-too-many battles. They worked the counter in shifts at all hours, day or night.\n\nThe only reason this establishment was rated Fair instead of Poor was the [[Shaar stew]]—boiled tubers and greens with pieces of meat that were [[spice]]d and seared before being added to a thick brown [[broth]]. The meat was usually from old [[rothé]], [[horse]], or [[ox]], and supplemented with [[rodent]]s caught on the plains. A serving of [[stew]] was 1 to 2 [[silver piece]]s, depending on the cost of the ingredients, and included a small round loaf of [[bread]] cut into a bowl to hold the stew. Customers who didn't want the breadbowl could bring their own [[bowl]] or metal [[cup]] (soldiers often used their [[helmet]]s). Other items included low-quality [[trathake]] (Mother Talasko's used fried [[entrail]]s of ungulates for the \"meat\") for 2 [[copper piece]]s each, and their own brand of [[Talasko ale|ale]] for 3 copper a pint, served in a hard-crust breadbowl or the customer's [[tankard]].\n\nFor one extra copper, Mother Talasko's supplied a wrap (a large cloth napkin) to keep the dust and [[soot]] of the city from flavoring the food until the buyer found a place to eat their meal.",
        "History": "This establishment was so old that no one alive remembered who \"Mother\" was."
