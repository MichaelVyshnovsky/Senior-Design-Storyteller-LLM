        "mainbody": "other Talaskos was a busy blurdren (a food counter with little, if any, seating) located in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the . It was owned by the Khaundroves, one of the twenty Onsruur families that formed the council of lords in the Iron City.\nThis blurdren was located at the east end of Raelrurs Run on the north corner with the nameless lane that circled the city just inside the walls. Raelrurs Run branched off of the North Way very close to Farrgaunlar, the southern gate into Khôltar.\nMother Talaskos was staffed by eight foul-tempered dwarves that all looked like they had former careers in the criminal underground or were the surviving casualties of one-too-many battles. They worked the counter in shifts at all hours, day or night.\nThe only reason this establishment was rated Fair instead of Poor was the Shaar stew—boiled tubers and greens with pieces of meat that were spiced and seared before being added to a thick brown broth. The meat was usually from old rothé, horse, or ox, and supplemented with rodents caught on the plains. A serving of stew was 1 to 2 silver pieces, depending on the cost of the ingredients, and included a small round loaf of bread cut into a bowl to hold the stew. Customers who didnt want the breadbowl could bring their own bowl or metal cup (soldiers often used their helmets). Other items included low-quality trathake (Mother Talaskos used fried entrails of ungulates for the \"meat\") for 2 copper pieces each, and their own brand of ale for 3 copper a pint, served in a hard-crust breadbowl or the customers tankard.\nFor one extra copper, Mother Talaskos supplied a wrap (a large cloth napkin) to keep the dust and soot of the city from flavoring the food until the buyer found a place to eat their meal.\nThis establishment was so old that no one alive remembered who \"Mother\" was."
