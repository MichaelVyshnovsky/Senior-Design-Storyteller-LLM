The Vault of Swords was a temple dedicated to Tempus located in Hillsfar. It was the largest temple in the city.
The Vault of Swords was located in the south west corner of the city. It was surrounded by its own grounds so it stood separate from the surrounding buildings.
Bloodied armor decorated the grand halls of the temple. And above the doors of the temple were carved the Tempuran litany "Disparage No Foe and Respect All".
The Vault of Swords was run by Dounalis Guff. The temples clergy disapproved of the citys practice of enslaving non-humans and forcing them to fight to the death in the Hillsfar Arena, a stance that was reflected in the litany carved above their doors.
