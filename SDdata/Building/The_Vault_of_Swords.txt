The '''Vault of Swords''' was a temple dedicated to [[Tempus]] located in [[Hillsfar]]. It was the largest temple in the city.

==Locations==
The Vault of Swords was located in the south west corner of the city. It was surrounded by its own grounds so it stood separate from the surrounding buildings.

==Description==
Bloodied armor decorated the grand halls of the temple. And above the doors of the temple were carved the Tempuran litany "Disparage No Foe and Respect All".{{Cite adventurers league/State of Hillsfar|3}}

==Inhabitants==
The Vault of Swords was run by [[Dounalis Guff]]. The temple's clergy disapproved of the city's practice of enslaving non-[[human]]s and forcing them to fight to the death in the [[Hillsfar Arena]], a stance that was reflected in the litany carved above their doors.
