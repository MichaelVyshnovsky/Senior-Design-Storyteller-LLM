        "mainbody": "during Karsuss Folly\nThe Library of Netheril was a prominent library and archive in Eileanar.\nThe Library was on the northwestern edge of the city between the Shadow Consortium and Constabulary Branch One.\nThe Library contained an astounding collection of tomes and scrolls on all manner of magical and mundane subjects, though still inferior to those found in Yeomans Loft. The massive amount of texts were archived and catalogued by head librarian Vincent with the assistance of Linden and Penruddock, and without their expertise it would be impossible to find any particular text. Beltcher, Degliangeli, and Ebrard were three highly knowledgeable historians and the Librarys most enthusiastic visitors, who spent much of their time examining the documents within."
