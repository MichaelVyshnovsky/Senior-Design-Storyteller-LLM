        "Location": "The Library was on the northwestern edge of the city between the [[Shadow Consortium]] and [[Constabulary Branch One]].",
        "Services": "The Library contained an astounding collection of tomes and scrolls on all manner of magical and mundane subjects, though still inferior to those found in [[Yeoman's Loft]]. The massive amount of texts were archived and catalogued by head librarian [[Vincent (Netherese)|Vincent]] with the assistance of [[Linden]] and [[Penruddock]], and without their expertise it would be impossible to find any particular text. [[Beltcher]], [[Degliangeli]], and [[Ebrard]] were three highly knowledgeable historians and the Library's most enthusiastic visitors, who spent much of their time examining the documents within."
