The Nightshade was a nightclub in Scornubel in the late 1360s DR.
It was dim and usually crowded, and a home to music, passion, and shady dealings. It served as a festhall and gambling house.
It lay on top of the crypt of the Wondermen, although the clubs staff denied its existence or claimed that the secret panel that granted access to the crypt moved regularly.
