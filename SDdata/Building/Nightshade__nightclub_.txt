The '''Nightshade''' was a nightclub in [[Scornubel]] in the late 1360s [[DR]].

It was dim and usually crowded, and a home to music, passion, and shady dealings. It served as a [[festhall]] and gambling house.

It lay on top of the crypt of the [[Wondermen]], although the club's staff denied its existence or claimed that the secret panel that granted access to the crypt moved regularly.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|107, 237}}
