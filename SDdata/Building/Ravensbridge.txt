The Ravensbridge, also known by one of its many older names, Pirateshead Bridge, was a bridge that connected the neighborhoods of the Shutters and Shadystreets in the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff.
The Ravensbridge connected the Shutters and Shadystreets on the eastern side of both neighborhoods, spanning across the Fire River.
During the period of time when the city of Ravens Bluff was being built on the ancient ruins, The Ravensbridge was unusable, its wood was rotten, and the underside was infested by monstrous spiders and sword spiders.
