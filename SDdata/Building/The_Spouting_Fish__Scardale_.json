It was the favorite place to stay for merchants and sailors staying in the city.\nThe Spouting Fish could be found on the northern side of Suth Street, between Sarkh Street and the Flameway, halfway up from the Scardale Town docks. And in turn, Suth Street was located north of Westmoot and was reachable via Shawl Street.\nThe inn had a green-tiled roof, a decaying front porch, and a sign hanging up for dead life. The buildings front had one round window and pillars carved with designs of mermaids and sea serpents.\nOnce inside, the Spouting Fish opened into dirty taproom, dimly illuminated by small candle-lamps and a hearth. The interior was made out of dark and oiled wood.\nThe inn was a crowded establishment yet was possibly the quietest taproom in all Faer√ªn with its guests hunched and mumbling to eachother in secrecy.\nThe guests were charged a single silver piece for lodgings per night and the price did not include food nor drink.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, adventurers soon to become gods, Midnight, Kelemvor, and Cyric, stayed at the The Spouting Fish on their way to the city of Tantras in the Vast.\nThe inn was owned by a secret spy of the Zhentarim, Yhelsed Cablehand. He would keep track of the ships entering or leaving the port city, detail the cargo they carried, and report it back to the agents at the Zhent compound. During the Time of Troubles, the inn employed a bald man named Hlund as its innkeeper."
