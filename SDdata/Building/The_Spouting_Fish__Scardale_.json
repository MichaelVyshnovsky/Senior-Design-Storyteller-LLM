        "mainbody": "'''The Spouting Fish''' was a quiet inn found in [[Scardale Town]] within [[Scardale]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was the favorite place to stay for merchants and sailors staying in the city.\n\n{{quote|Seek out the Spouting Fish. It's a place friendly to travelers, even now, and they say little about who comes and goes, and where they're from or who they bow to. You've little enough choice, anyway; the [[Green Griffon]]'s a barracks, now, with the town full of Zhentilar soldiers, and the [[Ashabenmouth Arms]] burned down a few rides back.|[[Theln Roaringhorn]]}}",
        "Location": "The Spouting Fish could be found on the northern side of [[Suth Street]], between [[Sarkh Street]] and the [[Flameway]], halfway up from the Scardale Town docks. And in turn, Suth Street was located north of [[Westmoot]] and was reachable via [[Shawl Street]].",
        "Structure": "The inn had a green-tiled roof, a decaying front porch, and a sign hanging up for dead life. The building's front had one round window and pillars carved with designs of [[mermaid]]s and [[sea serpent]]s.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The inn was a crowded establishment yet was possibly the quietest taproom in all [[Faer√ªn]] with its guests hunched and mumbling to eachother in secrecy."
        },
        "Services": "The guests were charged a single [[silver]] [[coin|piece]] for lodgings per night and the price did not include food nor drink.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]], adventurers soon to become [[god]]s, [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]], [[Kelemvor]], and [[Cyric]], stayed at the The Spouting Fish on their way to the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The inn was owned by a secret spy of the [[Zhentarim]], [[Yhelsed Cablehand]]. He would keep track of the ships entering or leaving the port city, detail the cargo they carried, and report it back to the agents at the [[Zhentilar compound (Scardale)|Zhent compound]]. During the Time of Troubles, the inn employed a bald man named [[Hlund]] as its innkeeper."
