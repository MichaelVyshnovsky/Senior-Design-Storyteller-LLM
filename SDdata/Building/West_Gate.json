        "mainbody": "The '''West Gate''' was the western point of entrance and exit through the [[Trollwall]] into and out of [[Waterdeep]], the City of Splendors, as well as the least used of the city's four gates.",
        "Description": "The gate featured two towers,",
        "Location": "The West Gate was found in western Waterdeep, in the southwest section of the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]], and opened on to [[Seas' Edge Beach]]<ref> and the [[Mud Flats]].",
        "Defenses": "Like other gates, members of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] were stationed at West Gate, though by contrast there were no [[Magisters of Waterdeep|magisters]] stationed at it. Locals were required to register with the stationed Guardsmen prior to exiting and entering, though any new arrivals that attempted to enter the city through West Gate would be turned away.\n\nPrior to the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, as a defensive measure one of the [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep]] was stationed beneath the West Gate and hidden away on the [[Ethereal plane]]. It actively defended against ethereal intrusion, attacking any ethereal creatures it perceived within Waterdeep's bounds, but would ignore ethereal [[humanoid]]s unless there was a group of ten or more of them. In 1385 DR, it and six of the other hidden Walking Statues exited the Ethereal plane and left their positions to rampage across the city.",
        "Inhabitants": "The West Gate was typically used by various sorts of fishermen, from those who fished from shore to those who went out with [[net]]s or traps, as well as [[clam]] diggers and the occasional bather."
