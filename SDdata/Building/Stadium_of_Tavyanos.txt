The '''Stadium of Tavynos''' was a stadium in the underwater city of [[Myth Nantar]].

==Location==
This stadium stood along [[Chamal Avenue]], in Myth Nantar's [[Myth Nantar/Trade Quarter|Trade Quarter]]. It was one of the few structures in the quarter that was untouched by the overgrowth of the [[Three Gates Reef]] by [[1371 DR]].

==Structure==
This stadium stood three stories tall and had a sublevel, containing a number of cells and staging areas.

==History==
During the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], the forces of [[Iakhovas]] forced the [[merfolk]] of [[Eadraal]] to abandon their city of [[Voalidru]]{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|59-60}} and a number of other towns,

In 1371 DR, a High [[priest|Merpriest]] of [[Eadro]] named [[Narvolas]] joined the refugees, using his expertise to tend to the injured.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|61}} Narvolas was approached by Prince-Regent [[Mirol|Mirol III]] of Eadraal, having been told by a mysterious [[fish]] that the priest knew of a way to reclaim Voalidru. Narvolas then informed Mirol III about his experiences during the siege on Voalidru and of an undead repelling relic known as the ''[[Akriloth]]'' before sending him away.
