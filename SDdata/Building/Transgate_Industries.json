        "Services": "The business specialized in the creation of ''portals'', ''[[gate]]s'', and other magical passages. The founders [[Ocelot (Netherese)|Ocelot]] and [[Ytartia]] developed their own unique type of gateway spell that was far more stable and safe than any other, and also did not inflict a sense of confusion and lost equilibrium on the user, making even interplanar travel much more comfortable. Their children [[Shander]], [[Thamer]], and [[Acciajuoli]] followed in their parents' footsteps and continued to refine and master the study of ''portals''."
