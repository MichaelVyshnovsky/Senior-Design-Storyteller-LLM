Kayas House of Repose was a prominent inn in Port Nyanzaru, Chult. Visiting adventurers were often referred there if they wanted a quiet and restful night.
The inn was located in Port Nyanzarus Market Ward just south of the Red Bazaar.
Kayas House of Repose was known to be relatively opulent and quiet compared to the average inn in Port Nyanzaru, and as a result, charged a full gold piece for a nights stay. 
During the events of the death curse in the late 15 century DR, Kayas House of Repose was a favorite drinking and meeting spot for the Harper spymaster known as Soggy Wren.
