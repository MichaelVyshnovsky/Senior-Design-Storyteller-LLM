The '''Bright Lady's Tower''' was a powerful and influential temple of [[Selûne]] in [[Selgaunt]] in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the [[757 DR|Year of Lost Wayfarers, 757 DR]], High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] declared charges of heresy against the [[New Moon Pact]], claiming they had fallen to the belief that [[Shar]] and Selûne were two facets of the same being. After gaining support from ten other major foreign temples of Selûne, the Pact was officially disbanded, the members executed, and their property appropriated. Only the canine companion [[Asha the Silent|Halftail]] escaped the purge.

Shortly after these events, the Bright Lady's Tower was mysteriously abandoned and destroyed, with its archives transferred to [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]]. No temple of Selûne was ever rebuilt in Selgaunt.

==Rumors & Legends==
After investigating historical documents around the event, High Moonmistress [[Dhauna Myritar]] came to the conclusion that the temple falsified all charges of heresy in order to confiscate property and eliminate a potential rival faction of the faith.
