During the first night, Delina and Krydle experienced hallucinations created by the Dark Powers and were almost driven to kill each other, were it not for the intervention of Shandie Freefoot. The following morning, they decided to leave the winery and continue their journey to Vallaki.\nThe winery was run by Davian and operated by his sons Adrian and Elvir and by his daughter Stefania and her husband Dag Tomescu."
