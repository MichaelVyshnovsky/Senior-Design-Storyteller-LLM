'''The Hidden Lady''' was an inn and tavern in the city of [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was owned and run by [[Phocius Green]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>

==Geography==
The Hidden Lady was not too far from the [[Dragonmere]] shores and docks of Suzail. And away from the bustle of the Promenade. Through the open windows of the inn, one could smell the pleasant marine breeze and hear the distant hustle of the fishermen.<ref>

==Description==
The building was constructed in the same manner as hundreds of others in [[Cormyr]]. The rooms of the Hidden Lady held no luxuries: the beds were shabbily cobbled together of mismatched wood, topped with straw mattresses; sheets were not dirty per se but in need of a good wash; old and well-used dressing table and uncomfortable chair were placed one per room; brass oil lamps were chained to the tables to avoid stealing. The round windows were made of crown glass.<ref>

The Hidden Lady's common room had a bar manned by the owner [[Phocius Green]] himself, a few tables, some by the open windows. The clientele consisted of the usual crowd - merchants, mercenaries, and local townsfolk. The food served at the inn was plain and simple and ale - watery and pungent.<ref>

Typical breakfast at the Lady consisted of bread and slices of spring fruit with cream.<ref>

==History==
In [[1357 DR]] a hero from [[Westgate]] - [[Alias]] and her loyal friend [[Dragonbait]] were staying at the Hidden Lady. The swordswoman was found unconscious on the Lady's stoop with a bag of gold. Phocius left the woman in one of the rooms for three days until she woke up with no memories of the recent events. The bag of gold was used as the payment for the inn's services. Alias found her sword arm adorned with a mysterious magical azure tattoo. Another guest of the inn, [[Akabar Bel Akash]], attempted to use magic on the swordswoman, it led to the azure bonds' magical defenses to explode in magical light, fires, and strobing rays, shocking and scaring the customers and Phocius Green himself.<ref> Later Phocius thought of Alias as the hidden lady, the inn's namesake.

By [[1358 DR]] the Hidden Lady was not catering directly to adventurers but gained a reputation among those who were on the run.<ref>
