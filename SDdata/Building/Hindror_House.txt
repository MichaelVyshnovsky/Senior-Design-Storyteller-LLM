'''Hindror House''' was a residence in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], that had been repurposed as rented workshop and office space, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

==Location==
This building was located near the Dubrinlar gate (the western gate through the walls of Khôltar) on the northwest side of [[Orntathtar Way]]. It sat between [[Nolvur's Manyworks]] and [[Halamor's Tower]]. On the other side of Halamor's Tower was [[Darrusktraal]], the duty-house for Dubrinlar.

==Structure==
Hindror House was a small tower (or "fist" in the local vernacular) that was not as big or as ornately decorated as Halamor's Tower.

==Services==
Rooms in this building were rented out to various individuals, guilds, or businesses that did finecrafter work&mdash;finishing, assembling, and polishing small items like hasps, doorknockers, and padlocks.

==History==
Hindror House was built as a residence, but when [[Halamor]] made a lucrative business out of renting his residence to finecrafters, his neighbors did the same.
