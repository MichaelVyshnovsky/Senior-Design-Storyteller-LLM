        "mainbody": "The House of the Lady was a temple to Selûne standing at the top of Spring Hill in Immersea, Cormyr.\nThe priestess Lleddew adventured with Cole Wyvernspur to gain treasure to complete the building of the temple.\nThe House of the Lady was a simple yet elaborate temple. The temple was more like a shrine. A circle of pillars supported a domed roof, inset with diamonds. There were no walls and a spring-fed pool occupied the center of the structure.\nThe Immer Stream issued from the hill and flowed down in cascades, known as Selûnes Stair. It was said that if one climbed to the top of the cataracts in the full moonlight, they would gain their hearts desire.\nThe temple was guarded by a Shard."
