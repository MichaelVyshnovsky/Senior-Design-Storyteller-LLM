        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Lathander''' in the small town of [[Freedale]] in the [[Dalelands]] was a grand structure dedicated to the [[Lathander|Morninglord]] that offered spiritual and divine services to the townies and adventurers alike.",
        "Location": "The temple stood one door down from the home of [[Sethel|Sethel the Scribe]], followed by the [[West Wind Stables]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was a grand white marble structure with its first level being a huge open-air shrine encircled with a green roof, while the second and third stories were topped with a steepled green-tiled roof.",
        "Services": "The Temple of Lathander offered standard services, similar to countless other shrines across the realms: [[Remove disease|curing sicknesses]] (250 [[gp]]) and [[Delay poison|poison]] (200 gp), [[Remove curse|removing curses]] (500 gp), and [[Raise dead|raising dead]] (starting at 1000 gp), although Farrish could not raise [[elves]]. All profits were considered to be donations to the temple. The priests of the temple also accepted [[magic item]]s as donations for their services. As the temple of Lathander was located in a tiny town, the priests needed to send a runner to [[Shadowdale]] to retrieve scrolls of ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]''.\n\nThe temple routinely refused aid to any visitors of [[evil]] nature but offered [[good]] travelers a place to spend the night if they were down on their luck and needed shelter.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple was built and run by a kind elderly priest called [[Farrish|Farrish the Priest]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nFarrish's apprentice [[cleric]] of Lathander, [[Lordan|Lordan the Pure]], also resided in the temple when he was not out adventuring with his fellow party."
