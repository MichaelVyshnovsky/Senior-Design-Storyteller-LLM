===Interior===
Inside of this temple was a vast library that was open to the public.

==Inhabitants==
The [[priest]]s that inhabited this temple were usually very open and helpful to anyone that sought out information regarding Rog'osto or the [[Ruined Kingdoms]] region in general. However, this was only the case for those whose desire was driven by genuine curiosity, not selfish desire or greed.
