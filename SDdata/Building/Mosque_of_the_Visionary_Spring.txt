The Mosque of the Visionary Spring was a temple to Zann in the city of Rogosto in 1367 DR and one of the most attended temples in all of the city.
This temple was one of the largest in the city of Rogosto. Its name derived from a natural well or spring that the temple was built over, which was believed to give revelatory trances.
Inside of this temple was a vast library that was open to the public.
The priests that inhabited this temple were usually very open and helpful to anyone that sought out information regarding Rogosto or the Ruined Kingdoms region in general. However, this was only the case for those whose desire was driven by genuine curiosity, not selfish desire or greed.
