'''Havalanker's Tavern''' was located in the town of [[Tulmon]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The tavern was aging and poorly lit, making all of the booths dark. The layout was confusing to patrons, but the tankards were generously large.

==Activities==
Havalanker's Tavern was a favorite for travelers and locals alike. They served meals that were usually overcooked and loaded with gravy. The dim atmosphere made it a great place for cover meetings.
