Havalankers Tavern was located in the town of Tulmon on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 century DR.
The tavern was aging and poorly lit, making all of the booths dark. The layout was confusing to patrons, but the tankards were generously large.
Havalankers Tavern was a favorite for travelers and locals alike. They served meals that were usually overcooked and loaded with gravy. The dim atmosphere made it a great place for cover meetings.
