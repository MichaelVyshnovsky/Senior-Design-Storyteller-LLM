Black Stars Logging was a collectively owned lumber mill in the town of Velarsburg, Harrowdale during the midâ€“14 century DR. Ownership was shared among all of the woodcutters who were not part of the Torsyld family.
They worked with furniture makers within the town, who would display their fine work within their showcased products. These finely crafted items were quite popular in the Dragon Reach.
As was the practice in Velarsburg, each logger that worked out of the Black Stars yard learned how to specifically harvest, cut, and season only one, or at most a few, types of wood. They would then brand their wood with the companys logo, an arch of three black stars.
