        "mainbody": "Thundaerlyn Hall was a meeting hall and rental market in Marsember in Cormyr during the late 14 century DR.\nAfter spring began in the , Princess Regent Alusair Obarskyr and the widowed queen Filfaeril Obarskyr were invited to Thundaerlyn Hall at first candlelight one evening. They assumed it was a trap, but decided to attend and spring it anyway.\nThere, a number of nobles, bolstered by Red Wizards of Thay led by Harnrim Starangh, attempted to end the Obarskyr line. They were somewhat derailed by a number of dragons using their breath weapons through the skylight, which led the Thayvians to counterattack with notably poor aim, shattering much of the building into ruins, and then attacking each other in the chaos. Even after that setback, the assassins were further slowed down by the intervention of Noumea Cardellith.\nAfter the assassination attempt was fumbled by the sudden appearance of dragons, there wasnt much left. Before that point, the building had a grand roof, with spires and skylights.\nOn the inside, the hall had at least one grand balcony overlooking a room that ran east to west. There were many doors around the hall.\nAt the time of the assassination attempt, at first candlelight, the inside was dimly lit. The skylight was also rusted to the point of uselessness.\nThe place was a rental market and meeting hall."
