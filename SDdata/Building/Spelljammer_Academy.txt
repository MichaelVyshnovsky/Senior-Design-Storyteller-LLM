Spelljammer Academy was the secret headquarters of the Spelljammer Fleet, located in Nimbral.
The Academy was located off the west coast of Nimbral, in the Trackless Sea.
Nine stories tall, the Academy was carved into a natural stone pillar  tall. The exterior was covered in walkways and balconies. An open bowl in the top of the pillar acted as a dock for spelljammers, mainly ones operated by the Spelljammer Fleet, but independent merchant spelljammers were not uncommon.
Each level of Spelljammer Academy is dedicated to a specific role. From top to bottom, these were a sea dock, administration, stores, cadet quarters, gymnasium, simulations deck, spelljammer nexus, bridge quarters, and spelljammer dock.
The sea dock was a cavern at the base of the pillar in which boats could unload personnel, visitors, equipment, supplies, and animals, and acted as the primary entrance to the Academy.
Administration included a reception area, visitor quarters, a lounge, and the facilitys record room. This was the highest level a visitor could enter.
The stores were where the equipment, weapons, and rations used by the Academy were stored.
The cadet quarters included separate sleeping areas for cadets and graduates, a laundry, a washroom, the Weeping Goddess, a kitchen, and a refectory. The Weeping Goddess was a raucous bar that serviced the cadets at the Academy.
The gymnasium included multiple spaces for physical activity, as well as a washroom.
The simulation chambers were rooms able to create realistic environments using illusion magic, in which new recruits could be trained in a safe environment under the watch of their teachers.
The spelljammer nexus included a laboratory, a library of astronomical references, and the spelljammer nexus itself A chamber containing a  tall orrery of Realmspace surrounded by eight training spelljamming helms.
The bridge quarters were the living spaces of the head staff that run the Academy. This included a private banquet chamber, a spellbook library, and a communication room called the oracularium.
The sky dock was the top level. It was open to the sky and operated as a dock for the Spelljammer Fleets spelljammers.
Spelljammer Academy trained all manner of races from Toril and the larger uniiverse to operate spelljammers and to fight to protect Toril from threats in the Astral Sea. This included the Corps and Spelljammer training tracks. Corps cadets were trained in melee and ranged weapons, whereas Spelljammer Cadets were trained in navigation and piloting of spelljammers.
Spelljammers were occasionally dispatched from the Academy in response to threats to Toril in Realmspace. Three out of ten such missions ended with all hands lost.
Different areas required security clearance to enter. Each clearance was indicated by uniform color. These clearances, in ascending order, were Visitor (Green), Cadet (Red), Sailor (Blue), Officer (Purple), and Bridge (Gold).
Spelljammer Academy was founded by Mirt the Merciless in a joint venture with Elmandar, who owned a shop on the Rock of Bral. Prince Andru invested in Spelljammer Academy, but reduced funding over questions of security.
