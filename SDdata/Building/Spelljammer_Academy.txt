'''Spelljammer Academy''' was the secret headquarters of the [[Spelljammer Fleet]], located in [[Nimbral]].<ref name=SjA />

==Location==
The Academy was located off the west coast of Nimbral, in the [[Trackless Sea]].<ref name=SjA />

==Structure==
Nine stories tall, the Academy was carved into a natural stone pillar {{SI|2000|feet|long=yes}} tall. The exterior was covered in walkways and balconies. An open bowl in the top of the pillar acted as a dock for [[spelljammer]]s, mainly ones operated by the Spelljammer Fleet, but independent merchant spelljammers were not uncommon.<ref name=SjA />

==Interior==
Each level of Spelljammer Academy is dedicated to a specific role. From top to bottom, these were a sea dock, administration, stores, cadet quarters, gymnasium, simulations deck, spelljammer nexus, bridge quarters, and spelljammer dock.<ref name=SjA />

The sea dock was a cavern at the base of the pillar in which boats could unload personnel, visitors, equipment, supplies, and animals, and acted as the primary entrance to the Academy.<ref name=SjA />

Administration included a reception area, visitor quarters, a lounge, and the facility's record room. This was the highest level a visitor could enter.<ref name=SjA />

The stores were where the equipment, weapons, and rations used by the Academy were stored.<ref name=SjA />

The cadet quarters included separate sleeping areas for cadets and graduates, a laundry, a washroom, the Weeping Goddess, a kitchen, and a refectory. The Weeping Goddess was a raucous bar that serviced the cadets at the Academy.<ref name=SjA />

The gymnasium included multiple spaces for physical activity, as well as a washroom.<ref name=SjA />

The simulation chambers were rooms able to create realistic environments using [[illusion]] [[magic]], in which new recruits could be trained in a safe environment under the watch of their teachers.<ref name=SjA />

The spelljammer nexus included a laboratory, a library of astronomical references, and the spelljammer nexus itself: A chamber containing a {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} tall [[orrery]] of [[Realmspace]] surrounded by eight training spelljamming helms.<ref name=SjA />

The bridge quarters were the living spaces of the head staff that run the Academy. This included a private banquet chamber, a [[spellbook]] library, and a communication room called the oracularium.<ref name=SjA />

The sky dock was the top level. It was open to the sky and operated as a dock for the Spelljammer Fleet's spelljammers.<ref name=SjA />

==Activities==
Spelljammer Academy trained all manner of races from [[Toril]] and the larger [[Cosmology|uniiverse]] to operate spelljammers and to fight to protect Toril from threats in the [[Astral Sea]]. This included the Corps and Spelljammer training tracks. Corps cadets were trained in melee and ranged weapons, whereas Spelljammer Cadets were trained in navigation and piloting of spelljammers.<ref name=SjA />

Spelljammers were occasionally dispatched from the Academy in response to threats to Toril in Realmspace. Three out of ten such missions ended with all hands lost.<ref name=SjA />

==Defenses==
Different areas required security clearance to enter. Each clearance was indicated by uniform color. These clearances, in ascending order, were Visitor (Green), Cadet (Red), Sailor (Blue), Officer (Purple), and Bridge (Gold).<ref name=SjA />

==History==
Spelljammer Academy was founded by [[Mirt the Merciless]] in a joint venture with [[Elmandar]], who owned a shop on the [[Rock of Bral]]. Prince [[Andru]] invested in Spelljammer Academy, but reduced funding over questions of security.<ref name=SjA />
