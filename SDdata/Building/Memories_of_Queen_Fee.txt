'''Memories of Queen Fee''' was an expensive club found in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]] around the {{YearlinkName|1487}}. It was named after the 
past Cormyrean queen, [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]].

==Location==
The club overlooked the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] in Suzail.

==Atmosphere==
The club was considered the most fashionable and expensive of clubs that held a view of the Promenade.

Nobles could be found here, trading drinks and gossip alike. Idle and rich nobles were particularly eager, wishing to participate in the most recent and juiciest of gossips. Evenings here would often involve heavy partaking of alcohol, leading patrons to often dine and drink at home in advance.

Exclusive upper rooms were available to patrons.

==History==
Memories of Queen Fee had been the host to many esteemed guests, ranging from several Cormyrean nobles, to [[Mirt]] and the [[Vampire]] [[Manshoon]]. Rumour mongering asides, the club was the site of veiled threats between its patrons. 

It was also here, that Manshoon was finally caught by [[War Wizards]] with Mirt's assistance.
