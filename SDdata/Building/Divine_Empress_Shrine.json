        "mainbody": "The Divine Empress Shrine was a shrine found in Miyama Province in Kozakura during the midâ€“14 century.\nThe Divine Empress Shrine was steeped in legend, dating back approximately 2,000 years. It was once expansive, but has fallen into disrepair. Many of its peripheral structures were partially collapsed, and the surrounding wall was in ruins in several places. At the core of the compound stood the main hall of worship, encasing a large split boulder, symbolic of the legendary birth of the Divine Empress. Unfortunately, the building was in a dilapidated state, with a leaking roof and its once vibrant red pillars desperately required a fresh coat of paint. Among the six shrines dedicated to the Stone-Bearing-Empress scattered across Kozakura, this one was the least visited.\nThe shrines upkeep was entrusted to three elderly men, former shukenja whose powers have waned. One was nearly deaf, another almost blind, and the third spent most of his time reminiscing about the past. Though friendly and well-meaning, they struggled with the infrequent presence of visitors, finding it difficult to accommodate their needs or recall the appropriate conduct in their company.\nIt was said that the Divine Empress, while rallying an army to confront the Oni Kings across Shinkoku, was pregnant. During her journey, the unborn child signaled its readiness to be born three times, but each time, she instructed it to wait. Upon reaching this particular location, the birth became imminent, and she delivered a stone. Disturbed by what she perceived as the childs disrespect in taking such a form, she commanded her soldiers to smash the stone. However, when struck, the stone shattered, revealing her son, Stone-Storm-Wind, fully grown. Despite the captivating tale, there was no concrete evidence to confirm the story or verify this shrine as the actual birthplace.\nRecently, the three elderly shukenja have faced troubles from bakemono raiding parties and would welcome any assistance, provided they could effectively communicate their plight."
