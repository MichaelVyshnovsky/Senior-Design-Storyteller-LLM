The '''Shop of Secrets''' was a shop in [[Myth Drannor]] that catered to [[wizard]]s and other spellcasters in the city, specializing in hard-to-find items of an arcane nature.{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|76}}

==Location==
The shop was located on the [[Street of Song]] in the [[Sheshyrinnam]] district of Myth Drannor.{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves/Map}}

==Structure==
The ground floor of the two-story building was largely dedicated to the storage of merchandise and the proud display of preserved and stuffed beasts and monsters, many of which were slain by [[adventurer]]s.

==Services==
The proprietor of the shop, [[Aster Enoctor]] offered a great variety of rare [[spell component]]s, much of which were extremely difficult to procure. Aster prided himself on the ability to obtain any item or substance that was placed on order, regardless of rarity or origin, if given enough time. While this was always the case, the wait time could go on for a number of years and cost a patron a great deal of money.

He also offered something rather unique and novel, the skill of being able to preserve, stuff and mount slain creatures, to display for others to see.
