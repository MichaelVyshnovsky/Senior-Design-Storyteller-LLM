The Temple of the Yellow Mountain was the seat of power for the Yellow Mountain Sect of Manass in Khazari in 1367 DR.
The temple was one of the larger structures found in Manass. It faced an open courtyard near the center of the city.
In all, 27 shukenja of the sect lived within the temple. The shukenja were aided by an additional 45 sohei. Dongzhei Nangpo was the ranking shukenja and effective leader of the temple.
Most of the inhabitants of Manass followed the teachings of the Yellow Mountain Sect, though they usually only visited the temple on holy days or to honor dead relatives.
The followers of the Yellow Mountain Sect often attacked the temple of their rival, the Red Mountain Sect.
