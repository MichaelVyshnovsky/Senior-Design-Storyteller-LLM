The Osculatory was known for its wild revelries that lasted late into the night. Fountains of alcohol flowed, and public displays of affection were commonplace.

==Services==
The Osculatory offered young and unmarried inhabitants of Suzail the opportunity to mingle, find companionship, start romances and relationships.
