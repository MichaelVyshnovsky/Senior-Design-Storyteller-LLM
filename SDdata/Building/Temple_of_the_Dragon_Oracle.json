        "mainbody": "century DR\nTemple of the Dragon Oracle was a temple within Mount Drakkor Rouge that was constructed by the Cult of the Dragon.\nthumb|273px|Three adventurers stand among the dragon statues of the temples plaza.\nThe front of this temple was a plaza with four finely crafted statues of dragons that stood atop ornate stone pedestals. These statues were about  tall,  in length, \nThese sculptures represented the four primary types of chromatic dragons &mdash red, black, blue, and green &mdash and were each the color of the dragon they represented. They were enchanted by the cultists and together acted as a beacon, drawing dragons to the location. They then continued to exert their influence over them, making the dragons subconsciously unable to abandon the temple for long periods, as well as subconsciously evasive of the plaza itself. If any of them were destroyed or removed from their pedestal, this effect would end.\nThe archway into the temple was  wide and centered in a heavily carved wall. This wall featured intricate carvings of dragons serving humans, framed by stone pilasters.\nThe opening entryway into this temple branched off into three paths, two of which did not have enough room for dragons to squeeze through. Straight north, the entryway opened to the temples central cavern. The hallways to the left and right of the entryway lead to the living quarters of the Dragon Cults witches or \"high priestesses\" and priests respectively. \nPriests Quarters This room had a very high ceiling, about  tall. It had murals depicting red, blue, green, yellow, and white dragons soaring high above the sky. The upper walls and ceilings had many niches for the Dragon Cultists gargoyle minions to hide in. Long after the cult abandoned the temple this room had debris scattered about, especially along its walls and in its corners. Along the eastern wall of this living quarter was a hidden door, opening to a stairway that branched south and north. Taking one either back outside to the plaza or to \"inner sanctum,\" the most rear of the lava caverns, respectively.\nOracles Quarters Like the previous room this one had a hidden door, the central cavern in witch the witches practiced their craft. Towards the end of the terrace (point \"A\" on the map) it sloped gently and had steps carved into it.\nThe Cavern of the Oracle This central cavern was huge, large enough for a dragon, and had two openings. One was located in the ceiling and had a trapezoidal shape, while the other was a volcanic vent on the ground (point \"13\" on the map). The area around the ceiling opening was tiled in such a way that it evoked dragon hide. The volcanic pit had a shaft that was  deep, connecting to live lava, and had hot acrid smoke billowing out of it regularly.\nOuter Chamber To the far right of the Cavern of the Oracle was another (point \"15\" on the map), that like the terrace was  above the ground. It was filled with stalactites and stalagmites, many as large as temple columns, as well as animal bones.\nInner Sanctum A  climb within the outer chamber lead to yet another cavern, where iron chains ending in dragon-sized manacles were mounted on the wall. These manacles lacked any key and locked when closed.\nAround the 10 century DR, members of the Cult of the Dragon came to the Thunder Peaks area. Eventually this cell of the Dragon Cult discovered the partially flooded crater of Mount Drakkor Rouge and the rocky island-like landmass in its center. The cells witches believed that the sulphurous vapors within the lava caverns of that rocky landmass would help them to prophesize the future. So the cultists set to work constructing a long bridge over to it, paved a steep path out of the volcanic rock, and finally carved out the temple itself.\nThe Dragon Cultists would perform some sorcerous experiments while living in the temple, one of these resulting in a black dragon being transformed into a dragonwight.\nSome time between the  and the , some evil force overran the temple and forced the Dragon Cultists to abandon it. They primarily nested within the former quarters of the Dragon Cults witches, though some lived in the former quarters of the Dragon Cults priests.\nIn the 12 century DR, after the stone golem known as Awtawmatawn was destroyed its pieces were scattered. The golems creator Valmous would go on to hide its head within the temples volcanic pit, along with a stone wizard locked box containing the Tome of Shaping Secrets.\nIn 1358 DR,Page 16 of The Shattered Statue states that Flashfire, \"...came south several years ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed the city of Phlan on the shores of the Moonsea.\" Describing the event known as the Flight of Dragons, which occurred in 1356 DR. However, that page also states that Flashfire only moved into the Temple of the Dragon Oracle recently. For more information on this, see Note 2. an adult red dragon known as Flashfire was drawn to the temple by its beacons. He settled within it, making the \"inner sanctum\" his lair.\nFlashfire eventually came to suspect that the temple was somehow exerting control over him, but little suspected that the statues were the ones responsible.\nBesides Flashfire and his gargoyle minions, the temple was home to a dragonwight who dwelled within its volcanic pit."
