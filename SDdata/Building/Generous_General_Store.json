        "mainbody": "Generous General Store was a store of Skull Crag in the Storm Horn Mountains of Cormyr in the 14 century DR.\nThe shop traded in a vide variety of mostly mundane goods. Most of of it of little interest to the adventuring folk, apart from such necessities as cloaks, belts, boots, robes, and mirrors.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, the Generous General Store was the only general store in Skull Crag, and was popular among the travelers of the High Road. Ironically enough, Generous General Store was quite overpriced during that period of time."
