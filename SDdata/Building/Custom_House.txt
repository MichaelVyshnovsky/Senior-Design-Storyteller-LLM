Any merchant or caravan entering or leaving Zhentil Keep was required to report to the Custom House to pay entry and exit taxes to the city. The rates were 1 gp per wagon to enter and 3 gp per wagon to exit. These rates doubled at night. Non-merchants entering and leaving the city on foot also had to pay their share of taxes at the rate of 2 cp to enter per person and 1 sp to exit per person. Those on horseback paid 1 sp to enter and 2 sp to exit. Anyone arriving on a flying mount or using some form of magic to fly paid 1 pp to enter and 2 pp to exit.
A squad of a dozen Zhentilar soldiers was stationed at the Custom House. The were aided by a pair of wizards. More guards could easily be called by ringing a loud gong.
