            "Interior": "The interior of the temple was painted with the blood of [[dragon]]s and [[gorgon]]s, then enspelled with numerous wards.\n\nInside the Vault was host to vast galleries of art pieces, statuary, and tapestries from all across [[Toril]]. These were all illuminated by a golden radiance given off by ''[[continual light]]'' [[spell]]s. Within the lower levels of the Vault, legendary wealth amounts of wealth were stored."

        "Activities": "The clergy of this temple acted as the administrative body of Neldorild. They also oversaw, alongside the city's [[Church of Thoth|Thothian]] clergy, the nearby [[papyrus]] slave farms along the delta of the [[River of Spears]]. This generated a great deal of wealth for both clergies.\n\nOn a bi-weekly schedule, the [[priest]]esses of the Vault held revels that were considered to be the pinnacle of the social calendar among those in Neldorild. They served as a great way to generate revenue for the church, as wealthy merchants and the nobility could only enter the Vault if they paid a hefty fee.",
        "Inhabitants": "The entrance to the Vault was guarded by a pair of [[iron golem]]s."
