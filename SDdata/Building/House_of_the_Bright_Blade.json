        "mainbody": "The '''House of the Bright Blade''', run by [[Zespara Alather]], was perhaps the most famous shop in [[Mirabar]] among [[human]]s. It was widely renowned as the best shop to get a [[sword]] that seemed as if it were custom-forged for its wielder.",
        "Interior": "The front room of the shop was lined with polished, paneled wood and a ''[[continual light]]'' [[spell]] was cast upon the cieling to illuminate the room. It glittered with the [[steel]] of hundreds of swords and [[dagger]]s of all sizes, finishes, and prices.\n\nA unique spell cast upon the room by a [[wizard]] friend of hers allowed Zespara to ''[[telekinesis|telekines]]'' to her hand any weapon that she had a hand in creating. This allowed her to impress customers as well as defend herself.\n\nIn the hallway between the shop and its smithing area there was a trapdoor on the floor that allowed entrance to an ancient temple.",
        "History": "The House of the Bright Blade was built atop an ancient temple of [[Auril]]. In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], followers of the Frostmaiden kept appearing inside the underground temple, both to worship her and to attack its walls with [[pick]]s in search of something. It is unknown what they were searching for, but they were frequently driven out by the apprentices of Zespara and the [[dwarven]] artisans of the First Below.",
        "Defenses": "The front room of the store was guarded by ten female [[warrior]]s, six of them outfitted in [[full plate]] and four of them unarmored. All were former [[thieves]] undercover and armed with a ''[[wand of paralyzation]]''. They generally stood outside the store, lying in wait for any thieving patron that might try to dash out the door.",
        "Inhabitants": "The store was chiefly run by Zespara and her bearded she-dwarf companion [[Calauthra Morgyr]]. The smithy also employed two female humans and four female dwarves."
