        "Structure": "{{fq|text=Behold the fate of those who insist too much.|source=Sign posted outside the crypt, destroyed by Elminster}}\nThere was a sign posted outside of the crypt, until [[Elminster Aumar]] defaced it with a spell that made it crumble to dust. Guards could rest along one corner of the crypt, while the opposite path was lined with stones.",
        "Interior": "There were stacked stone coffers in a room inside, which had a funeral slab in the center. Older coffins had the likeness of the departed on their lids, while the newer coffins were plain, some even nameless.",
        "Defenses": "Inside, there were a number of traps, including door wards, a falling beam trap, and a number of jutting blades.\n\nOutside, there were guards posted on a corner.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, about a hundred and sixty years after the Moondark family had all perished, Elminster entered the crypt and placed an [[enchanted]] [[wand]], an [[everbright]] [[dagger]] that glowed upon command, and [[spell]] notes in the late [[Eaergladden Moondark]]'s coffin.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Elminster knew that Eaergladden Moondark was no wizard, and that he'd in fact died penniless, but counted on the fact that no one would know this if they came looking for hidden [[magic]]."
