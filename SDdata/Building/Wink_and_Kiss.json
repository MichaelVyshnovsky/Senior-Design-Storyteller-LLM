It attracted those individuals who were supportive of and often benefited from the criminal organization.\nIt was located just east of the Fishyard, Yartars open-air marketplace.\nThe Wink and Kiss was a maze–like collection of compact rooms, concealed side-passages, and sequestered passageways.\nThe festhall was a bawdy and fun establishment that didnt take itself too seriously. It was a great place for those who wanted to find easy-going friends for the evening.\nDue to its distinguished patrons however, the Wink and Kiss was declared a safe haven for anyone who entered. Weapons were checked at the door and rowdy behavior was not tolerated.\nAs of the mid–14 century DR, it was run by two brothers, Asklar and Beldorm.\n* Nareen Dhest, a thief of the Hand that stole a devastation orb from the Cult of the Eternal Flame"
