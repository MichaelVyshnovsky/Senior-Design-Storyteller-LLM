        "mainbody": "The '''Lizard's Gizzard''' was a boarding house that operated in [[Daggerford]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned by a [[half-orc]] woman named [[Sasha (Daggerford)|Sasha]] who had a soft spot for those people that society cast away.",

        "Services": "The establishment was wholly dedicated to offering folks a place to stay at night. It offered nothing in the way of libations or provisions."
