        "mainbody": "he Lizards Gizzard was a boarding house that operated in Daggerford during the late 15 century DR. It was owned by a half-orc woman named Sasha who had a soft spot for those people that society cast away.\nIt was located on the north side of the towns Money Quarter, on the southern side of Dukes Way.\nWhile its sign featured rather gruesome depiction of the young Tyndal eviscerating a lizardfolk marauder, the Lizards Gizzard was a place of altruism. Its staff comprised many young women that were left orphaned and abandoned.\nThe establishment was wholly dedicated to offering folks a place to stay at night. It offered nothing in the way of libations or provisions."
