The Black Banner Inn was a popular establishment in Daerlun, interior Faer√ªn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This building was located on the west side of Daerlun near the Sunset Gate. Its main entrance was on the north side of the Street of the Dragon which connected the gate to the Westmarket and beyond.
From above, the building looked like a giant gauntlet laying on its side with the fingers curling around the central courtyard and the wrist/forearm part jutting off to the northeast.
The rooms at the Black Banner were luxurious and most walls were paneled with exquisite wood.
The lighting was muted throughout most of the establishment, making it fairly private but gloomy. Community dining and revelry was discouraged&mdashguests were almost exclusively served food and drink in their rooms.
The only exception was the grand lounge where businessfolk could meet and gambling tables were available. There, the clientele could enjoy fine vintages from the well-stocked wine cellar.
