        "mainbody": "The Citadel of Protection was a grand temple of Helm located in the Temple District of Ravens Bluff. It took up an entire city block between DeVillars Ride, Blacktree Boulevard and Raven Way, within the districts Altarside neighborhood and soared into the sky. \nThe Citadel was an awesome, circular keep that, at first glance, resembled a city armory or grand governing building. The immensely-tall stronghold featured a central turret that ascended well above the citys skyline, perhaps the highest spot within all the Bluff. The exterior of the spire had an observation area complete with giant, brass-framed lenses that allowed for a closer view of the cityscape from the lofty vantage point."
