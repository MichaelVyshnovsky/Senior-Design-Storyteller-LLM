The Whitkeep Hostel was a large manor house found in Baldurs Gate that served a number of purposes throughout its existence. Throughout the years it was a private residence, a squatters pad, and, during the later 15 century DR, a gnomish artists commune.
It became a gathering place for social progressives and creative-minded folks of all races.
The hostel was quite spacious, with 37 separate single-room apartments.
The manor originally belonged to a rich caravan master who lost their riches following a number of devastating monster attacks. After their fall from wealth, the building was taken over by a group of squatters. 
By the early 15 century, the hostel began to attract people similar to its current residents.
