The '''Whitkeep Hostel''' was a large manor house found in [[Baldur's Gate]] that served a number of purposes throughout its existence. Throughout the years it was a private residence, a squatter's pad, and, during the later 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[gnomish]] artists' commune.

It became a gathering place for social progressives and creative-minded folks of all races.

==Description==
The hostel was quite spacious, with 37 separate single-room apartments.

==History==
The manor originally belonged to a rich caravan master who lost their riches following a number of devastating monster attacks. After their fall from wealth, the building was taken over by a group of squatters. 

By the early 15{{th}} century, the hostel began to attract people similar to its current residents.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Pernilla Cabrenrock|Pernilla "Prole" Cabrenrock]]: A vociferous critic of the Baldurian government
* [[Ardryn Deagle]]: A rather individualistic [[mage]] and inventor
