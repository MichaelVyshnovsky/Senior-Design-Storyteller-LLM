The shops entrances were located under an arch formed by the buildings second floor that stretched north over the street to another exit located on the second floor, used by the Tefoco and living quarters. The sign that hung above the entrance depicted a beehive surrounded by bottles of wine and crates. The shop itself was on the buildings first floor, with the room filled with cupboards and shelves of goods that included food, potions, wines, and some general miscellany.\nIn the , Beehive Goods and Wares was run by Oliver Tefoco and was home to his spouse Kroyce Tefoco and two youngest children–Hemjax and Maggie. The familys older children lived in other parts of the city and traveled with merchant caravans along the Sword Coast North. When the cultist army of The Absolute targeted the Gate and began a march to attack it, Beehive Goods and Wares became the home to Oliver only as he sent his spouse and children to their family in Beregost, out of harms way. Beehive remained abuzz with business through the tumult of the coming war. During that time, Notales Hostel that sheltered refugees, asked Oliver Tefoco for any supplies he would be willing to donate. In turn, Beehive Goods and Waress own supplier–Durinbold & Oathoon, Provisoners, suspended deliveries of food and dry goods until trade caravans could enter the Gate."
