        "mainbody": "Wuggs Necessities was a shop in the Lower Port of Skullport.\nThe shop was cluttered with a variety of dungeon exploration tools, with a strict policy of \"you touch it, youve bought it,\" which deterred would-be browsers from casual examination of the wares.\nWuggs Necessities catered to adventurers seeking supplies for ventures into Undermountain. Wuggs offered basic equipment, including lanterns, ropes, and pitons, all of notably poor quality but priced as high as the market would tolerate.\nIn addition to selling equipment, Wuggs occasionally bought surplus adventuring gear from those returning from Undermountain. However, he offered no more than 15% of the actual value, profiting handsomely from the transaction. Despite his high prices and low-quality stock, Wugg’s shop remained frequented by those willing to pay for convenience, albeit at a premium.\nWuggs Necessities was owned by Thesophus Wugg, a resourceful trader of dubious reputation. Complaints from dissatisfied customers regarding the substandard quality of his ropes and other equipment prompted Wugg to hire Snogg Mudmane as his shop guard. Unbeknownst to Wugg, Snogg suffered from narcolepsy, often falling asleep behind a fabric curtain hung in an alcove at the rear of the shop. This curtain, originally intended to obscure the guard’s presence and add an element of deterrence, has had mixed results, as customers were frequently unsure whether Snogg was awake and observing or not. Wugg, lacking the courage to confront his formidable, easily angered minotaur employee, has yet to replace him."
