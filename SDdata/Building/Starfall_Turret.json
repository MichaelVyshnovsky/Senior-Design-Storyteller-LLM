        "Location": "The tower was close to [[Cormanthyr]]'s capital.",
        "Structure": "Starfall Turret resembled a barrow, grassy hill, but one side had windows, and it rose abruptly into a stone tower at the north end. The yard was full of stumps, fallen trees, shrubs and creeper vines.",
        "Activities": "Mythanthor carried out wizardly research in the tower.",
        "Defenses": "There were at least four wards around the grounds.",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|241}}, after [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] called on [[Mythanthar]] to create a ''[[Mythal]]'' for [[Cormanthyr]], [[Mladris]] and [[Bhuraelea]] took the first shift in guarding Starfall Turret and the old mage. While guarding, they were ambushed by four wizards, including [[Haemir Waelvor]] and three [[Starym]] mages. They were badly wounded during the fight, and only the intervention of [[Elminster]], watching as a form of [[ghost]] at the time, gained Mythanthor enough time to slay all attackers, though his tower was reduced to rubble.\n\nAfter the fight, Elminster reformed, and found no trace of Bhuraelea or Mladris. Instead, he found the spells of [[Llombaerth Starym]], then known as [[The Masked]], retrieving all objects of possible value; his ghost form too was snatched up.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|301-304|16}}"
