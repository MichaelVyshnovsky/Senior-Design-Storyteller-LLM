        "mainbody": "Starfall Turret was the home of Mythanthar until .\nThe tower was close to Cormanthyrs capital.\nStarfall Turret resembled a barrow, grassy hill, but one side had windows, and it rose abruptly into a stone tower at the north end. The yard was full of stumps, fallen trees, shrubs and creeper vines.\nMythanthor carried out wizardly research in the tower.\nThere were at least four wards around the grounds.\nIn , after Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl called on Mythanthar to create a Mythal for Cormanthyr, Mladris and Bhuraelea took the first shift in guarding Starfall Turret and the old mage. While guarding, they were ambushed by four wizards, including Haemir Waelvor and three Starym mages. They were badly wounded during the fight, and only the intervention of Elminster, watching as a form of ghost at the time, gained Mythanthor enough time to slay all attackers, though his tower was reduced to rubble.\nAfter the fight, Elminster reformed, and found no trace of Bhuraelea or Mladris. Instead, he found the spells of Llombaerth Starym, then known as The Masked, retrieving all objects of possible value his ghost form too was snatched up."
