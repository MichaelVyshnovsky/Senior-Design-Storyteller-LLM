        "mainbody": "The Black Blade and Bloody Boar was a rough-and-tumble tavern that was renowned as perhaps the most unsavory establishment found in city of Mulmaster. It also served as a bloody area run one of the citys most notorious criminals, Gethmedra Darmov.\nIt was found amid the squalor that was the southern region of Mulmaster,\nThe main feature of the taverns spacious common room was the great fighting pit set  deep within its floor, known as the \"Boar Pit\". Off to the sides of the fighting area were a magnificent hearth, within which often roasted a giant boar (as befitting the taverns name), a single throne offered only to the taverns owner, and a -tall seated bronze statue that held a casket full of invaluable magical potions. Viewing galleries encircle the common room, allowing bystanders to fully take in each match.\nBeneath the inns floor were a series of pens that housed its gladiatorial combatants.\nAs of the late 15 century, the tavern bar was tended by the diminutive and matronly woman known to her patrons only as Ma. She offered a variety goods and services to her clientele, such as watered-down ale for the low price of 1 sp per mug, along with information about goings-on in the city, albeit for a much steeper price.\nThe Black Blades true claim to fame however were the lethal pit gladiatorial matches it held for the entertainment of the citys nobility. Challengers would be thrown into the pit to face off terrifying combatants, such as the Fangs of the Chimera fighting group, or perhaps the monstrous beast after which they were named.\nThe Black Blade was protected by the guardsmen loyal to Lady Darmov, the Fangs of the Chimera gladiators, as well as the enigmatic mage Devamari.\n* The Stone Dwarf, a pit fighter that survived the odds of the taverns arena and became its champion for some time."
