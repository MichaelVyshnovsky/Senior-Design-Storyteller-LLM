'''Heldartowers''' was an urban mansion and home of the noble [[Cormyr]]ean [[Barelder]] family in [[Suzail]].

==Location==
Heldartowers sat in the city block east of the [[Horngate]] and north of the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] in Suzail, in the northwestern corner of the city.

==Structure==
The house was tall with no grounds or garden, and was made of dark stone with a tile roof and [[lead]]ed [[glass]] windows.

==History==
Heldartowers was originally the home of the non-noble [[Vaerendur Heldar]], who eventually sold it to the Barelder family in the late 15{{th}} century and moved to [[Marsember]]. The Barelders kept the name unchanged.

==Inhabitants==
The place was the primary residence of the Barelder family, rather than their rural estate of [[Windcrag House]] on the [[Tun Shores]]. Lady [[Narnathra Barelder]] and her husband [[Varkander Heldruth]] lived there with their daughters [[Maereenra Barelder|Maereenra]] and [[Braeryl Barelder|Braeryl]], keeping a quiet household together.
