Dukars Academy was an academy of magic in the underwater city of Myth Nantar, comparable to a bards college.
It comprised four college buildings, one for each order, and a fifth octagonal building known as the Paragons College. 
The buildings appeared disconnected on the surface, but underneath the city they were connected with tunnels to allow easy access.
