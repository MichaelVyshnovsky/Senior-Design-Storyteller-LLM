Castle Irlingstar was a remote and secret prison stronghold in the Thunder Peaks on the eastern border of Cormyr, where the king put traitor nobles, murderers, and agents of Sembia and Westgate.
It was established after 1369 DR by Royal Mage Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, who erected the magical wall, and survived the Spellplague. It was originally built by the Irlingstar house of Waterdeep and then sold to Comryr.
At one point before 1385 DR the first prisoner was Amarune, although she later escaped.
In 1480 DR, a mysterious murder occurred inside the castle.
