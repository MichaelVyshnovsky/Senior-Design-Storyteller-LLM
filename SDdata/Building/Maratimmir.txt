Maratimmir was the ducal seat of Ankaram and the official home of Duchess Vajra Valmeyjar of Tethyr, though she spent most of her time at the royal palace of Faerntarn.
Maratimmir was located about 30 miles east of the city of Myratma along the southern bank of the River Ith within the confines of County Calimmon.
The fortified palace was built in Calishite style. Some of the buildings on the grounds had been destroyed during the Reclamation Wars.
The palace was the former home of the duke of Ankramir before the Interregnum.
