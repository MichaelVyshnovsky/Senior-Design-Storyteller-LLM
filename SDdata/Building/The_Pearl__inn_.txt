The Pearl was a luxury inn and the tallest building in the Amnian city of Crimmor.
The inn was located in the Wheel Ward, along the High Ride separating the district from the River Ward.
Sporting spectacular spires and curving up-swept roofs, the Pearl was the tallest building in the city.
The Pearl was known to offer the most attentive service. An impressive number of servants manned the building, all of which were literate, long-serving, loyal, and of the utmost discretion.
Originally a grand family palace, this building was rebuilt and became an infamous seedy rooming house.
By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Pearl was the most luxurious inn of the city. It was common for merchants to stay at the Pearl for just their first night in town in order to bath, launder, and enjoy a good time. Prices for one night ranged from 10 gp per night for the cheapest rooms, to 12 gp per night for a suite. Prices were all-inclusive, comprising for example foods, drinks, and permission to use the stables.
