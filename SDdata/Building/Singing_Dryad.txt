The '''Singing Dryad''' was a tavern and dining hall located in the village of [[Snowmantle]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of the few businesses that survived the occupation of the settlement by [[Zhentarim]] forces in the year [[1355 DR]].

==History==
The original owner of the Dryad, [[Juliana Saan]]'s father, was killed when the [[Zhent]]s took over Snowmantle. The leader of the Zhentarim, a [[wizard]] by the name of [[Ragnoth]], transformed the establishment into a messhall for the [[Zhentilar]] troops under the command of [[Grimbones|Grimbones the Bold]], to which Julianna reluctantly acquiesced. She was particularly careful not to wrong the Zhents, in order to preserve the legacy of her father.

In the year [[1369 DR]], the Dryad was frequented by a gang of Zhentilar recruiters led by the [[half-orc]] [[Gruel (half-orc)|Gruel]].
