        "mainbody": "XÃ»l-Jarak, also called The Gray Citadel because of its gray ashen walls, was an orc fortress that had long been in disrepair by the 1370s DR. It was situated two days ride north of Melvaunt along the road to Glister, in the land of Thar. It sat atop a 20-ft-high (7.1 m) barren crag, with another two stories of fortifications. The four levels of dungeons beneath the fortress had an entrance to the Underdark. Within the dungeons was the crypt of King Kursk One-Tusk the Merciless."
