        "mainbody": "The Golden Flute Tavern was a tavern opened by bard Dinsul in the Mortonbrace neighborhood of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nThe taverns ground floor included a bar and a kitchen. The second floor offered private booths to the customers, some VIP areas, and areas dedicated to bards studies. Lastly, the second flood was where the taverns guest rooms were located, often occupied by the owners friends and guild mates.\nThe Flute was located in the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff, a prime location near the temple dedicated to Sune, the Palace of Passion, and the Temple of Lliira.\nApart from serving drinks and entertainment, The Golden Flute was used as a hall of training for beginner bards, offering them lodgings, education, and the stage. The taverns attic was redesigned to serve as Dinsul students housing. The only payment for the schooling was the students donating one percent of their performances income to The Flute. Additionally, the tavern offered aid to any members of the Bards Guild.\nEach evenings entertainment acts there traditionally closed by a group performance of all the schools members and Dinsul himself, playing the Golden Dragon Flute. Each Friday, The Flute hosted a dance night or a ball with admission priced at a single golden raven plus whatever drinks the attendees purchased.\nDinsuls establishment of the Flute was a great achievement and a long-running project. The taverns opening was officially announced on the pages of the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter, penned by Silvia Sinderan, who praised Dinsul as a self-made bard and an inspiration."
