        "mainbody": "he Gallery of Antiquities served as the treasury of Ysawis in 1367 DR.\nThe gallery was found within the Jade Palace of the Necromancers,\nThe threshold to the treasury was warded with powerful symbols of insanity that would lash out at any intruder when they approached within . The symbols glowed malevolently, warning of their inherent danger. The interior of the treasury was observed by four skull watchers. Three of the watchers were in plain sight, but the fourth was cleverly hidden. Any of the skull watchers would emit an ear-piercing scream when an intruder was spotted.\nThe necromancer Kazerabet bound seven vile spectres to the treasury with powerful necromantic runes inlaid upon the floor, walls, and ceiling. The spirits were enraged by their forced servitude, having haunted the treasury for centuries before Kazerabet and Sumulaels arrival, and vented their fury on any unlucky intruders.\nKazerabet hoarded the riches of Ysawis within the treasury. Most, if not all, of the wealth accumulated here were transported from the citys catacombs by undead servants.\nThe wealth stored within the Gallery of Antiquities was legendary. In addition to many priceless works of art and jewelry, the gallery contained tens of thousands of ancient coins minted during the height of Ysawis power. Even a single copper coin from this collection was worth up to 100 modern Zakharan dinar."
