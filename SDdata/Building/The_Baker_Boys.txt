'''The Baker Boys''', or '''1 Curios Circle''', was a bakery located in the bustling [[Merchant's District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Baker Boys was located on the tiny [[Curios Circle]]{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|20}} cul-de-sac off of [[Merchant's Way]] in the Market District. It was surrounded by a nest of five other shops: a [[perfume]]ry called [[Bouquet Boutique]]; [[Ephram's Antiquities]]; [[Madame LaTachia's]], a fortune teller's parlor; a magic miscellany shop called [[Malishar's Magicks]]; and [[Wycke's]], a chandler. The Baker Boys was the first shop on the left side when entering the cul-de-sac, with Ephram's being its next-door neighbor.

==Services==
The owners and the titular Baker Boys were a strong couple. [[Rojak Hammersmith]] was a beardless fun-loving sober [[dwarf]] and his partner, [[Culwen Furryfeet]], a typically mischievous prankster [[hin]]. Both men were kind and friendly, making fish pastries, [[pie]]s, and [[donut]]s daily, while occasionally bursting into impromptu food fights.

The Baker Boys was not seen as a respectable business by its neighbors. [[William Wycke]] of the [[candle]] shop thought the owners to be too irresponsible to be good businessmen and overly boisterous in the early mornings,{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|7}} but flamboyant [[Serge]] of the [[Bouquet Boutique]] thought the couple to be "a blast."{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|8}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} many smaller businesses were targeted by a group of criminals demanding protection money. To make things even more preposterous, these bandits wore the faces of renowned heroes and adventurers of the [[Living City]]. These criminals—[[Marella]], [[Elizza]], [[Moamar]], and [[Rundell]]—were members of the warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s army that waged war on [[the Vast]] just a year prior. They used a magic [[wand]] that let them take on other people's guises. The criminals struck at The Baker Boys and the rest of the shops in its cul-de-sac. Their extortion resulted in Malishar's Magicks being a burnt-out husk. The Baker Boys lost 500 [[gold]] [[Raven (coin)|ravens]] that they paid for "protection" and 300 more in destroyed merchandise. Despite the loss, Culwen and Rojak remained loud and happy, aiming to survive the best they could. Two days later, both gave an interview to a group of heroes who investigated the racketeering and eventually ended the threat to the district.
