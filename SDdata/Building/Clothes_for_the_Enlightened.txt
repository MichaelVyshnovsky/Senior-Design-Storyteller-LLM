Clothes for the Enlightened was a shop located in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR, owned and operated by Hakim Sayad.
This shop was actually a pair of large red-striped pavilion tents.
Hakim carried all of the items needed to complete an entire wardrobe.
With silk purchased directly from the House of Al-Kamari, Hakim earned a reputation for offering fabulous clothing items. Several members of the Royal Court of Huzuz purchase their garments from Hakim.
