The Veiled Vampiress was a festhall and tavern in the Amnian city of Esmeltaran during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The place was built in the north end of the city, near the northern gates.
The Veiled Vampiress was actually run by two vampires who secretly fed on random guests and avoided discovery. Despite this, it offered excellent service at very cheap prices.
