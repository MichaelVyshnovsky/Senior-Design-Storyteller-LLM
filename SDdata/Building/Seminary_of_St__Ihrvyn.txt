The '''Seminary of St. lhrvyn''' was an affluent, religious art school in [[Calimshan]] operated by the [[Church of Ilmater]].

==Location==
This seminary was located on a cliff overlooking the [[Shining Sea]] and opposite the city of [[Volothamp]].

==Activities==
This seminary preached a gospel of peaceful understanding through painting, poetry, song, and sculpture. To this end, St. Ihrvyn's had a large collection of statuettes from the [[Erehnir Dynasty]] and old [[Calishite]] statues to act as examples for its students to work from. However, many of these students could often be found huddled on the cliff staring right at the four visible heads of the [[Eight Erehnirs]] of Volothamp.

==History==
At some point in its history, this seminary took on a lay acolyte, a [[pasha]] who bequeathed the site his money after having lost his heirs as a result of the [[guild war (Calimshan)|guild wars]].
