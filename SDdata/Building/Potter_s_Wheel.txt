The '''Potter's Wheel''' was a small shop located in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Location==
The shop was located in the far northwest corner of Daggerford on [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] next to [[Wayfel's Smithy]].

==Activities==
The shop was rather unimpressive. This was not an accident since the shop owner, [[Marcus]], was an agent of the duke and couldn't care less about the success of the business.
