The Temple of the Nine Travelers was one of the newer buildings in Manass in 1367 DR. It was a temple devoted to the Faith of the Nine Travelers, in particular to the Giants in Gray.
It was home to a small sect of the Nine Travelers faith originating from Shou Lung that worshiped the Giants in Gray themselves.
A Shou settler named Li Dawchyuan managed the temple. Many Shou travelers made a point to stop and visit the temple since it was a good place to catch up on gossip from Shou Lung.
The Yellow Mountain Sect in Manass kept a careful eye on the Temple of the Nine Travelers since they were not sure if this "new" religion from the east was a threat to their goals.
