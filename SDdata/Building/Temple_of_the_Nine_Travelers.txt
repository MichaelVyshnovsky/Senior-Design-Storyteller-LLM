The '''Temple of the Nine Travelers''' was one of the newer buildings in [[Manass]] in [[1367 DR]]. It was a temple devoted to the [[Faith of the Nine Travelers]], in particular to the [[Giants in Gray]].

==Faith==
It was home to a small sect of the Nine Travelers faith originating from [[Shou Lung]] that worshiped the Giants in Gray themselves.

==Inhabitants==
A [[Shou]] settler named [[Li Dawchyuan]] managed the temple. Many Shou travelers made a point to stop and visit the temple since it was a good place to catch up on gossip from Shou Lung.

==Activities==
The [[Yellow Mountain Sect]] in Manass kept a careful eye on the Temple of the Nine Travelers since they were not sure if this "new" religion from the east was a threat to their goals.
