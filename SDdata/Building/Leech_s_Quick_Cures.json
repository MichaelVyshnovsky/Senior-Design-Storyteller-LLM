        "mainbody": "Leechs Quick Cures was a shop in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nLeechs Quick Cures was owned by Leech, a nervous human and healer known for his medical services and specializing in quick recovery.\nLeech provided services such as suturing wounds, setting broken bones, and removing poisons for a nominal fee. He was particularly known for his ability to get individuals back on their feet in an hour or less through a combination of chirurgery, herbal remedies, and bloodletting. The costs for minor healing and remedies varied depending on the severity of the ailment.\nLeechs chirurgery, a skill he acquired from a Calishite physician with a notorious reputation, was a procedure that took approximately one hour and required the patient to rest for 24 hours after the operation. Should the patient fail to rest, all natural healing was suspended for the day, and there was a 50% chance of contracting a blood disease. While patients could engage in light conversation and minimal travel, any form of physical exertion halted the healing process. The cost for chirurgery was 10 gp.\nLeech developed a method for removing poisons using giant leeches. For injected poisons, a leech was applied to the injection site, and the process took several minutes. During this time, the effects of the poison were halted while the leech extracted the poison. For ingested poisons, the leech was placed on the patients torso. The cost of poison removal was typically 20 gold pieces, which covered the cost of replacing the leech, as it was killed by the poison during the process.\nLeech also offered a range of herbal balms, salves, and other medicinal materials, such as bandages and splints. These items ranged in price from 5 sp to 10 gold pieces per use. While these remedies were mildly effective, they were in high demand among those seeking basic medical care.\nIn cases where patients died on Leechs operating table, their bodies were unceremoniously piled into a wheelbarrow and transported to Mhaugs. Mhaug compensated Leech for the corpses, paying between 25 and 35 gp per body, depending on the condition of the remains. This side arrangement ensured that even Leechs failed treatments had a profitable outcome."
