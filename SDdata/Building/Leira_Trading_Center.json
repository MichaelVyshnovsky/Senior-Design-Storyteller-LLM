        "mainbody": "The '''Leira Trading Center''' was the largest and most beautiful building on [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]]. It contained over fifty [[spelljammer|spelljamming]] docks and was the center of commerce of the entire moon.",
        "Location": "The Trading Center was located on the far side of Selûne, in the center of the equatorial region. It was surrounded by thousands of smaller colorful residential and commercial buildings, such as theaters and other businesses.",
        "Structure": "The enormous building was over 300 ft (91 m) tall. Its numerous spelljamming dry docks were the dominant feature of the structure.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "All working hands and inhabitants were very welcoming to spelljamming crews, who were generally free to roam anywhere except for a few off-limits secret locations.\n\nThis cordiality did not extend to [[Toril]]ians, however. Since Selûnians were paranoid about spies from Toril and extremely intolerant of anyone trying to pry into their military secrets, any visitors claiming to be from Toril were likely to be arrested and tried for espionage. Conviction meant immediate decapitation."
        },
        "Services": "Trade at the Trading Center, like elsewhere on Selûne, was very active. Selûnians enjoyed importing items of great beauty and comfort, as well as deadly [[magic item]]s in case an assault from Toril were to happen, and they consumed all forms of art and entertainment.",
        "Inhabitants": "The dry docks of the Leira Trading Center were supervised by the [[human]] [[Icon Drowmaster]], who was married to a [[halfling]] woman. He was friendly to [[humanoid]] crews, except for [[lizardfolk]], tolerated [[beholder]] crews if they wanted to trade, and disliked [[illithid]]s and [[neogi]]. His refusal to allow a neogi ship to dock earned him a scar on his face."
