The offices of the Middle Magistrate were the base of operations of the Middle Magistrate of Bral.
The complex was located on Traders Way in Middle City, on the leading starboard side of Brals Great Market, about a half block away and around the corner from the curios shop of Gamalon Idogyr, the famous Tethyrian mage.
The complex consisted of several connected buildings a courtroom, a jail with six cells, a barracks for the Magistrates Watch, and offices. The architecture here was far less fancy than that of the High Magistrates.
The Watch of the Middle City were far more active than those of the High City and included about 20 guardsmen and several mages. Guardsmen were well-equipped They patrolled in groups of four to a dozen, though only occasionally, unless they were summoned to apprehend a particularly dangerous criminal.
