The '''Dark Wind Stables''' were located within the great fortress of [[Sarahin]] in the [[Haunted Lands]].{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|24}}

==Description==
[[Basalt]] floors and white-washed stone walls adorned the stables. The stalls and lintels were made from [[cedar]]wood.

==Inhabitants==
These stables housed racing camels called [[camel|mehari]] and horses used for racing and sending messages. [[Hisan bin Hanif]] cared for the horses.

Beyond the mundane animals, the stables also held a two-headed [[roc]] named [[Sar]], and a [[pegasus]] named [[Sulbain]].
