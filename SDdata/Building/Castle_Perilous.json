        "mainbody": "Castle Perilous, also called the Citadel of the Witch-King, was the most significant fortification in Vaasa and the one-time seat of power for the lich Zhengyi, the Witch-King of Vaasa, for his attacks on Damara.\nIt was a fortress of dark stone and bound in iron.\nPrior to its destruction, Castle Perilous was a tall and narrow tower that rose high above the wasteland and could be seen for miles. and then soared into the air, supporting two wide parapets on its way up and ending in an onion dome. Four smaller spiked-roof towers were supported in midair by flying buttresses on which were treacherous open-air staircases connecting them to the main citadel.\nthumb|right|200px|The ruins of Castle Perilous circa 1372 DR.After its destruction, the castle was little more than its bones and foundations standing amidst a pile of rubble. There was an extensive dungeon complex beneath the castle which remained a site of great danger long after the upper sections of the castle had crumbled.\nAfter the castle was said to have rejuvenated in the late 15 century DR, the walls of the main structure were sleek and black, and were inscribed with runes that absorbed light There were no obvious means of gaining entry to the castle proper, and the lower dungeons were rumored to once again be teeming with horrors.\nCastle Perilous was located on a rocky crag in the tundra of north-central Vaasa which was frozen beneath the Great Glacier at the time. The castles immediate area was an utterly lifeless wasteland of crumbling dirt that was carved by steep and jagged miles-long ravines as deep as 100 feet (30.5 meters).\nPrior to the castles destruction, the surrounding region for several miles was contaminated by Abyssal energy seeping out of the portal in the dungeon beneath the castle. The area felt permanently on the verge of a huge rainstorm, with dark clouds overhead and heavy humidity in the air, but the land itself was devoid of any grass or water whatsoever\nthumb|left|245px|A rendering of Castle Perilous just before its destruction which shows its distinctive onion dome.On a single night in the ,The Forgotten Realms campaign sets for both the 1st edition (set 1357 DR) and 2nd edition (set 1368 DR) give Zhengyi and the castles appearance as happening \"20 years ago.\" The 3rd edition onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and set the year as 1347 DR. the fortress called Castle Perilous was raised by Zhengyi with the aid of demons. Zhengyi then declared himself \"the Witch-King,\" and gathered an army of giants, goblins, orcs, undead, and assassins to use in a conquest of Vaasa and Damara.\nThe castle served as Zhengyis personal headquarters, although as a lich he needed few amenities and mostly just sat in his imposing throne room. The castles primary purpose was to guard the Abyssal gate in the subbasement, so it was full of traps and monsters acting as guards, mostly in the forms of undead, demons, and elementals. Defense of the castles exterior was handled by the ancient white dragon Arctigis,> and by Zhengyi himself.\nThe castle collapsed into ruins when Gareth Dragonsbane and his party of adventurers defeated Zhengyi in the .\nThereafter, Castle Perilous was a crumbling ruin, filled with lurking monsters, including giants, goblins, and bugbears, and frequented by adventurers looking for remnants of Zhengyis magic. During the 1370s DR, it appeared that the dragons were frequently being driven off or slain by either the adventurers or the even-worse monsters of Castle Perilous. where dragonspawn were being created.\nIn the , an earthquake struck the region and the castle shed its crumbling exterior to reveal seemingly new sleek black stone underneath, inscribed with runes that absorbed light. Some Warlock Knights of Vaasa worried Zhengyis demons had rebuilt the castle overnight. Vaasas ruling Ironfell Council was concerned by the events and sent investigators, but none could pierce the defensive runes on the castles exterior. By the , their sages were pouring over ancient texts to learn more about the Castle. Efforts to bypass the wards were being spearheaded by a Luminary supported by a Knight-Vindicator, although they had accomplished little save for sending a large number of \"test subjects\" to fiery deaths attempting to bypass the castles wards. \nAt that same time, the self-styled heir to the Witch-King, Mansard Kanaoth, began amassing troops in secret near the castle, hoping to conquer Vaasa but likewise having no luck deciphering the castles wards. As of the next year, chromatic dragons were once again being drawn inexplicably to the ruins, although they too were unable to bypass its magical defenses.\nUnbeknownst to the Warlock Knights or the world at large, Castle Perilouss dark interior had come to be occupied by tanarukks in the service of Orcus, who had entered from the same portal to the Abyss that had been believed to have been closed when Gareth Dragonsbane slew Zhengyi. In fact, it had been the reactivation of this portal that had brought about the castles renewal, and both events had occurred as the powers of the Abyss stirred in anticipation the outbreak of the Abyssal Plague. \nAs of the , the cause of Castle Perilouss rejuvenation continued to remain a widespread mystery."
