        "mainbody": "Silmerhelve Villa was the family estate of the Waterdhavian noble house Silmerhelve.\nThe Silmerhelve Villa was located in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep,\nThis building complex consisted of one high-quality building that stood three stories tall.Evidence of this information can be seen in how the villa is depicted on maps.\nWatchful Protector\nThrough means of several enchanted mirrors and portraits, the Silmerhelve family were watched over in their estate by the male bronze dragon Nymmurh. These acted as permanent scrying \"portholes\" that the dragon could hear, see, and speak through at will. They had a strong invisible magical aura.\nThese mirrors and portraits showed no sign of Nymmurhs presence, though he could manipulate the scrying magics to reveal his head just \"beyond\" them. Alternatively, he could have them portray him as a Silmerhelve ancestor, what he referred to as \"the haunted portrait trick.\"\nSome of these mirrors and portraits were situated near hearths, ovens, and in the cellar. This allowed Nymmurh to cry out an alarm if ever there was a theft or fire occuring on the estate. And whenever a visitor was nosing where they shouldnt be, Nymmurh would mischievously speak through them in ghostly whispers, imitate people that were elsewhere, make them think someone was coming, or imitate a member of the Silmerhelves and recite a love poem to trick the individual into thinking they were in love with them.\nBeyond scrying, Nymmurh could will these paintings and portraits to act as temporary portals that would deposit one within his lair in the high peaks of Alaron, or allowed him to visit the Silmerhelves in a human guise. When this portal effect was active, one needed only to touch the mirror or portrait to be transported, but the transportee could not be greater in volume than Nymmurh himself. A side-effect of this was that any active magic on or surrounding something being transported was \"turned off\", though inactive magical powers and inactive enchantments werent effected. Another consequence of these portals was that they would ruin the magical connection between the mirror or portrait and the scrying globe in Nymmurhs lair&mdashhe could reform this link from his lair, but it was a long process and required material components that were rare and hard to obtain.\nThe Silmerhelve Villas magical mirrors and portraits had been present since at least the , In the 14 century DR, whenever Nymmurh came to visit the estate it was usually in the guise of Lady Saerista Silmerhelve."
