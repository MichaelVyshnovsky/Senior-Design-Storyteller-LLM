They had a strong invisible magical aura.\n\nThese mirrors and portraits showed no sign of Nymmurh's presence, though he could manipulate the ''scrying'' [[magic]]s to reveal his head just \"beyond\" them. Alternatively, he could have them portray him as a Silmerhelve ancestor, what he referred to as \"the haunted portrait trick.\"\n\nSome of these mirrors and portraits were situated near hearths, ovens, and in the cellar. This allowed Nymmurh to cry out an alarm if ever there was a theft or fire occuring on the estate. And whenever a visitor was nosing where they shouldn't be, Nymmurh would mischievously speak through them in ghostly whispers, imitate people that were elsewhere, make them think someone was coming, or imitate a member of the Silmerhelves and recite a love poem to trick the individual into thinking they were in love with them.\n\nBeyond ''scrying'', Nymmurh could will these paintings and portraits to act as temporary ''[[portal]]s'' that would deposit one within his lair{{Cite dragon/250/Wyrms of the North: Nymmurh|81}} in the high peaks of [[Alaron]], or allowed him to visit the Silmerhelves in a [[human]] guise. When this ''portal'' effect was active, one needed only to touch the mirror or portrait to be transported, but the transportee could not be greater in volume than Nymmurh himself. A side-effect of this was that any active magic on or surrounding something being transported was \"turned off\", though inactive magical powers and inactive enchantments weren't effected. Another consequence of these ''portals'' was that they would ruin the magical connection between the mirror or portrait and the scrying globe in Nymmurh's lair&mdash;he could reform this link from his lair, but it was a long process and required [[material component]]s that were rare and hard to obtain."
