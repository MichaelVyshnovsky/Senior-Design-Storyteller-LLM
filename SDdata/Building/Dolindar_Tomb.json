        "mainbody": "he Dolindar Tomb was a large crypt in the Shadowfell city of Evernight in which the Dolindar family was interred.\nThe tomb was within Evernights Graveyard. It was located away from the east wall, and was marked by a yard overgrown with weeds.\nA secret \"entrance\" existed within the Paupers Graveyard of Neverwinter on the Material Plane. Within a dusty and nondescript tomb&mdashrecognizable only by an inscription reading \"Home Away, To Rest Forever\"&mdashwas a Crevice of Dusk that connected to the final chamber of the Tomb.\nThe tomb was built of durable stone. Above ground, there was a single-story 20- by  structure with a portico on its east side. The entrance was a large stone door engraved with \"DOLINDAR\" that sat within this portico, and beyond the door was a steep spiral staircase that descended  into the tomb proper.\nThe chambers of the tomb were  high and lacked any light sources. Stone doors divided it into multiple rooms, and these doors scraped loudly when moved.\nThe main hall of the tomb contained ten niches in which nine lesser members of the family had been interred. Each niche was covered by a stone slab adorned with an image of the deceased, however any writing or art that might have identified the deceased had long since faded away by the late 15 century DR. The tenth, unoccupied niche served as the home of the tombs ghost caretaker, Newmy.\nTwo staircases branched off from this main hall. The northern staircase led to a chamber that contained the stone coffins of the siblings Evisha and Nolan Dolindar, while the southern staircase led to a small, unlocked vault that contained the familys treasures sitting atop six stone pedestals. Each of these branching side chambers then rejoined via additional stairs to connect in the heavily trapped resting place of Kevetta Dolindar, the former matriarch of the family. Located within her stone coffin was the Crevice of Dusk to Neverwinter.\nThe entire tomb exuded a sense of loneliness that could be felt even before crossing the threshold. This feeling was so strong that it isolated allies from each other, rendering them unable to motivate themselves to come to each others aid.\nThe tomb was old and the Dolindars were long dead by the late 15 century DR. At this time, Evernights more ancient residents (such as the vampire Sangora) still remembered the family and recalled tales of the Crevice of Dusk within their tomb.\nThe tomb was cleaned and maintained by the ghost Newmy, however she did not dare enter the chambers of Evisha and Nolan&mdashwho had both arisen in death as lost sorrowsworn&mdashor the tomb of Kevetta&mdashwho had become a lonely sorrowsworn."
