The northern staircase led to a chamber that contained the stone [[coffin]]s of the siblings [[Evisha Dolindar|Evisha]] and [[Nolan Dolindar]], while the southern staircase led to a small, unlocked vault that contained the family's treasures sitting atop six stone pedestals. Each of these branching side chambers then rejoined via additional stairs to connect in the heavily trapped resting place of [[Kevetta Dolindar]], the former matriarch of the family. Located within her stone coffin was the Crevice of Dusk to Neverwinter.\n\n===Atmosphere===\nThe entire tomb exuded a sense of loneliness that could be felt even before crossing the threshold. This feeling was so strong that it isolated allies from each other, rendering them unable to motivate themselves to come to each other's aid.<ref name=\"V:EoR-p32 />",
        "Location": "The tomb was within Evernight's [[Graveyard (Evernight)|Graveyard]]. It was located away from the east wall, and was marked by a yard overgrown with weeds.\n\nA secret \"entrance\" existed within the [[Pauper's Graveyard]] of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Material Plane]]. Within a dusty and nondescript tomb&mdash;recognizable only by an inscription reading \"Home Away, To Rest Forever\"&mdash;was a [[Crevice of Dusk]] that connected to the final chamber of the Tomb.",
        "Structure": "The tomb was built of durable stone. Above ground, there was a single-story 20- by {{SIAdj|20|foot|long=yes}} structure with a portico on its east side.

        "History": "The tomb was old and the Dolindars were long dead by the late 15{{th}} century DR. At this time, Evernight's more ancient residents (such as the [[vampire]] [[Sangora]]) still remembered the family and recalled tales of the Crevice of Dusk within their tomb.",
        "Inhabitants": "The tomb was cleaned and maintained by the ghost Newmy, however she did not dare enter the chambers of Evisha and Nolan&mdash;who had both arisen in death as [[lost sorrowsworn]]&mdash;or the tomb of Kevetta&mdash;who had become a [[lonely sorrowsworn]]."
