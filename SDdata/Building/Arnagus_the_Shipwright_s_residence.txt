This was a large shipbuilding shed owned by Arnagus the Shipwright in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This shed stood along Dock Street, facing Deepwater Harbor. It was situated to the left of the the Full Sails guildhall and across the street from the Mermaids Arms.
This structure stood three stories tall, had white walls and a red roof, and out front of it a slipway for ships ran from the shed down into the harbor.
In addition to being the shed where Arnaguss shipbuilding business was conducted, which were some of the finest ships to sail the Sword Coast, it acted as his place of residence. Arnagus was unwelcoming of visitors as he feared sabotage or someone setting the place on fire.
People often went to the docks to peer in at the work going on inside and the launching of ships drew large crowds.
In the mid 14 century DR, this shed was considered to be among the largest privately owned buildings in Waterdeep.
