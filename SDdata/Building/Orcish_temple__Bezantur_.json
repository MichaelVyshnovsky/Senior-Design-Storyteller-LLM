        "mainbody": "The Orcish Temple was a place of worship dedicated to the various deities of the Orc pantheon in Bezantur, Thay. It contained crudely carved stone idols which were said to be ancient depictions of Gruumsh, Bahgtru, Ilneval, Luthic, Shargaas, Yurtrus, and various demigods and tribal heroes of the orcs of Thay.\nThe temple was located southwest of the center of Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" It lay just south of the City Tombs.\nIt was a three-story tall black building.\nThe temple was maintained and attended by the orcish warriors mercenaries who served local Thayan officials. They prayed to the stone idols of their gods and heroes in raucous and violent rituals which often involved the sacrifice of prisoners, often a fellow orc who had committed a crime.\nThe orcish congregation claimed that when their ceremonies were sufficiently bloody and violent, the idol of Gruumsh himself would come to life and offer counsel and guidance to those orcs who prostrated themselves before him."
