        "Activities": "The temple was maintained and attended by the orcish warriors mercenaries who served local Thayan officials.

        "Rumors & Legends": "The orcish congregation claimed that when their ceremonies were sufficiently bloody and violent, the idol of Gruumsh himself would come to life and offer counsel and guidance to those orcs who prostrated themselves before him."
