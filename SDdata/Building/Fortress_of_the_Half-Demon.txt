The '''Fortress of the Half-Demon''' was a ruined stone fort located north of [[Rashemen]]. It was built in antiquity by the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] people and had a huge iron gate fashioned into the face of a leering [[demon]]. One of the gates was half-open, thereby the name "Half-Demon".{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3330}} The fortress was square in shape and had a huge stone keep in the center of the courtyard.{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3481}} Underneath the fortress were a huge number of catacombs and passages, at least some of which lead to pocket planes which were used as extra burial space long ago.

==History==
As of [[1372 DR]], the fortress was the home of marauders led by the [[hagspawn]] [[Losk]] who would attack travelers along the nearby [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] to the north.

In [[1479 DR]] a group of [[undead]] [[Durthan]] allied with an unknown force, possibly Nar, used the fortress as their base of operations.  An army consisting of Rashemi berserkers and [[fey]] and led by [[Aoth Fezim]] attacked the fortress and drove the Durthan and their undead minions into the tunnels under the fort in the [[Battle of the Fortress of the Half-Demon]].{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3779}}
