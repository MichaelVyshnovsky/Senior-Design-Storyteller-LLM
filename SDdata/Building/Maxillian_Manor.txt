'''Maxillian Manor''' was the home of an old Maxillian family, located in the [[Western Farmlands]] of [[Daggerford]] and an [[apple]] farm.

==Location==
Maxillian Manor orchard was located across the road from the summer home of the Bricket family that belonged to [[Alicine Bricket]] and her sister, [[Muriel Bricket]], flowing their brother's death in [[1372 DR]]. The orchard was surrounded with [[corn]] fields and was not far from the shores of [[Delimbiyr River]]. An old dried-up wishing well laid to the west from the Maxillian orchard.

==Structure==
The manor was a simple but old and sturdy two-storied structure.

==Interior==
The farm's manor opened immediately into a spacious sitting room with huge fireplaces and its walls decorated with many mounted heads of local wildlife. The floors were covered with [[bear]] pelts. The left from the main entrance was the manor's kitchen with a storage area and a door to the basement. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], farm visitors could notice a prominent wet [[god]] smell inside the manor.

The manor's dreadful secret was its two underground levels. First - was a long private sitting chamber with a comfortable chair and a roaring fireplace, used by the master of the house, where he kept the spoils of his hunts. Further down laid the place called the Chase Maze. The century-old dungeon was a maze used by the Maxillian family to hunt their "guests" after being stripped of their gear and left in one of the Maze's cells. The Maze had thick reinforced stone walls and a series of rooms and corridors separated by doors and gates. Its called were decorated with scattered remnants of the farm's guests.

==History==
Maxillian Manor was several centuries old, build on, back then, wildlands. The structure and farmlands surrounding it were a product of centuries of hard work and spilled sweat carved out of untamed woodlands. During the early days of the Maxillian clan, the settlers were forced to defend themselves from wild [[boar]]s, bandits, and bears. Many of the Maxillian clan perished taming the wile, and some were changed by it, became stronger.

Stronger, in the case of the Maxillian family, meant [[lycanthropy]]. The clan of [[werewolves]] was lead by [[Frederick Maxillian]] ''circa'' [[1272 DR]], under his guidance, the family decided to start an orchard, work in the fields by day, making money, supporting themselves, and at night - honing their bloodlust and hunger for hunt. Frederick constructed the Chase Maze under the manor, the place where the werewolves could satiate their bestial nature. Over the course of following years, the Maze was expanded by the descendants of Frederick Maxillian.

In [[1372 DR]], the inhabitants of Maxillian Manor included [[Jonas Maxillian Senior]], his son [[Jonas Maxillian Junior]], and the unwilling lycanthrope, [[Gravia Maxillian]]. The father and son proudly followed the Maxillian tradition. One day they encountered the [[Hero of Daggerford]] who was passing through the Western Farmlands. The family charmed the adventurer and offered them a seat at the family's table celebrating Jonas Junior's birthday and a [[mug]] of [[Gravia's hot apple cider]]. The birthday [[cake]] and hot [[cider]] turned out to be a trap. The Hero was drugged and left naked in the Chase Maze.

Within the dungeon, the Hero met another victim of the family, [[Pettywick Wocket]] who shared the rules of the chase with them and unveiled the way to beat the werewolves and escape that Gravia passed onto the young [[gnome]] in secret from her bloodthirsty family. When the portcullis was raised, the Hero had twenty seconds of head start before the Junior was unleashed and tracked the unlucky adventurer in his werewolf state. The Hero of Daggerford was successful and, after recovering the gear, managed to slay the father and the son. Freed from her husband, Gravia mourned her son and departed for the nearest temple of [[Sel√ªne]] as the goddess of the moon had goodly lycanthrope worshipers and she would be safe among her less bloodthirsty kin.
