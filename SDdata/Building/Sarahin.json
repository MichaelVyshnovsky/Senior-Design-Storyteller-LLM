        "mainbody": "Sarahin, translated as the \"Wolves Den\", was a unique fortress located deep within the Haunted Lands in Zakhara.\nThe actual fortress complex was located on a mountain named Jabal Sarahin.\nThe land surrounding Sarahin was dry but received enough rainfall to support forage for small herds of livestock.\nSarahin sat atop a plateau that stood over  high. Since the walls surrounding the fortress were quarried from the same rock as the plateau, Sarahin could not be seen from the ground even though the plateau was the highest point as far as the eye could see.\nSarahin was originally constructed by Amir Heidar Qan of the jann.\nDuring this time, the fortress of the Everlasting was destroyed, forcing the holy slayers to scatter throughout the Land of Fate. One holy slayer learned of Sarahin and began planning to overtake the citadel with Grandfather Hasan. \nHoly slayers infiltrated a nearby village, and attempted to convert the jann to the worship of Hajama. The jann, in turn, tried to convert their sheikh. The sheikh appeared to be won over, but later ambushed the holy slayer missionaries and washed Sarahins ramparts with their blood. The heads of the missionaries were returned to Grandfather Hasan with a message saying Sarahin belonged to the sheikh.\nAfter receiving the message, the Grandfather traveled to Sarahin where he was admitted as a guest. Hasan told the sheikh that he would forgive the slaughter of his followers if the sheikh would give him all the land that could be contained by a single oxs hide in exchange for 3,000 dinars. Since the sheikh wished to put the matter behind him, he agreed to the deal before his entire court. \nGrandfather Hasan then proceeded to cut the ox hide into tiny strips, which he used to surround the entire fortress of Sarahin. Outraged by the clever deceit, the sheikh refused to honor the bargain, but the jann of the court forced him to uphold his word."
