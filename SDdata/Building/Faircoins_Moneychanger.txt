The Faircoins Moneychanger was a shrine dedicated to Waukeen in the city of Marsember.
Faircoins was located on the mainland portion of Marsember, down the road from the home of Vindala Chalanther.
This shrine was small in size.
In addition to being a shrine of Waukeen, this building provided manycoins services to the Marsemban public.
By the mid-14 century DR, this shrine had become abandoned by the Church of Waukeen. However, Lord Ildool maintained it as a public service to Marsembans for the purpose of its manycoins services.
Some Marsembans speculated that the lights occasionally seen in the shrine during nighttime hours was Lord Ildool or his agents using it as a meeting place with less-than-savory individuals.
