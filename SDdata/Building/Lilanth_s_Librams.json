        "Structure": "Lilanth's Librams was a two-story building in fair condition.",
        "Services": "Lilanth's Librams served as Skullport's closest approximation to a library and bookstore. The shop contained an impressive collection of hundreds of [[book]]s. Topics ranged from practical guides, such as [[Cormyr|Cormyrean]] gardening manuals, to esoteric subjects like [[Hedge wizard|hedge magic]]. Prices varied widely, with more common volumes starting at 20 [[gold pieces]] and rare tomes commanding prices of 2,000 gold pieces or more.\n\nIn addition to book sales, Lilanth's Librams offered scrivening supplies, including [[parchment]], [[ink]], and [[quill]]s, as well as bookbinding services. Imaginative leather book covers and ornate metal clasps had garnered particular praise among clientele.",
        "Inhabitants": "Lilanth's Librams was owned by the reserved and soft-spoken [[wizard]] [[Lilanth Shytongue]]. The shop was notably home to a small legion of [[cat]]s, which served as vigilant guardians against [[mice]], [[rat]]s and [[jermlaine]]."
