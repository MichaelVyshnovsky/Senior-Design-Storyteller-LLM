        "mainbody": "'''Thardresk Crypt''', also known as the '''Dungeon of Swords''', was the supposed family tomb of the royal [[House Thardresk]], ruling family of the ancient kingdom of [[Anauria]]. It was said to be the final resting place of the great [[Thausimbel Thardresk|King Thausimbel]], as well as his daughter [[Shaddara|Queen Shaddara]].",
        "Geography": "The crypt was one of many of its kind dating back to Anauria, set within the center of the [[Serpent Hills]], in the [[Western Heartlands]].\n\nIt served as a ''[[portal]] nexus'' that opened a network of portals between a number of Anaurian tombs, including another false Thardresk family crypt beneath a ruined temple of [[Jergal]] in the eastern deserts of [[Anauroch]], and an empty tomb beneath the [[Evermoors]].",
        "Description": "Circa the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the crypt was only accessible by means of a tunnel that connected to the carved-out pathways of a mining expedition. All other openings had been sealed away by an earthquake some time ago.\n\nIt was as heavily guarded as the other tombs in the area, with magical traps and tricks, along with [[undead]], ready to attack adventurers.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, [[gnome]]s of [[Clan Argentum]] began digging into the center of the Serpent Hills in search for [[silver]] and broke through into the crypts. A few of the braver gnome warriors ventured within but were forced to flee and abandon their dig site in short order.\n\nStarting in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and members of [[House Orogoth]] both sought out the crypts for their own ends.",
        "Inhabitants": "At least one adult [[deep dragon]] was known to dwell within the deepest depths of the crypt before being slain by [[Cult of the Dragon|dragon cultists]] circa [[1371 DR]], though its mate survived to drive them out.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Throughout the history of its existence, rumors held that it was actually a false crypt, disguising the existence of a number of tombs for the royalty of Anauria that were linked together by its ''portal nexus''. This was confirmed by the dragon cultists that made their foray into its depths during the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR."
