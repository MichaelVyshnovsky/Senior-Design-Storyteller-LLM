        "mainbody": "Uthe Lodge was the Eveningstar home of the ranger Peron Uthe in the late 15 century DR.\nPerons home was located on the eastern edge of Eveningstar, next to the Starwater River.\nThe lodge was a stately, spacious three-story home with a basement level. After its primal invasion, it became filled with thick vines, roots, and other greenery that altered the layout significantly. The basement connected onto a small natural cavern via a hidden passageway.\n300px|thumb|An overgrown hall of the house.\nUthe Lodge had been a part of the Uthe family for generations, who served as rangers and foresters for the region. During the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, Peron Uthe returned home from a jaunt to Thorngap in the Kings Forest where he met the druid Halsaime. He had been infected with a strange disease created by the druid, causing him to sicken and slowly transform into a red musk zombie. He went to the Eveningstar War Hospital for treatment, causing a disaster there as he turned more patients into zombies before he was eventually being destroyed by hired adventurers.\nAt his abandoned home, a group of Halsaimes servants took residence, led the dryad Sylvie and the wood woads Robur, Prinus, and Falcata. They were supported by a force of red musk zombies, vine horrors, wisps, and a pack of wolves that lived at Perons home. The lodge became choked with quick-growing plants that filled the interior and crept up the outside of the building, turning it into a dank, humid labyrinth that smelled of rotting vegetation. The dryads tree, planted in the basement level, even grew up and through the top of the roof. If not stopped, Sylvie planned to extend this growth further and destroy the village of Eveningstar. Fortunately, the healer Eolynn Arva caught sight of the astounding overgrowth and searched for help, finding the same group that dealt with Peron earlier.\n300px|thumb|Sylvies dryadic tree in the basement.\nUnbeknownst to this group, a parallel investigation was being performed by a group of Harpers in search of Oriphaun Huntsilver. They wished to find him through Halsaime and so sought Perons assistance only to arrive too late. The bard Jussko Kwahn infiltrated the lodge to determine what had happened to Peron Uthe and eventually teamed up with the adventurers as they fought their way past the defenders and destroyed the dryad Sylvie, potentially finding the wall of wood or foresters brush hook in the mess.\nWithout Peron or the dryad, the overgrowth was contained and Eveningstar was saved from another threat. This led to the Harpers continuing the investigation into Halsaime, eventually finding and killing him at the Druids Deep."
