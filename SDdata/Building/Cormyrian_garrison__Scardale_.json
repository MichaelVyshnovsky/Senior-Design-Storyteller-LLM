        "mainbody": "The Cormyrian garrison was a fortification in Scardale Town established by the nation of Cormyr to represent their interests in the area following the second inter-dale war in 1356 DR.\nThe garrison was maintained by the Forest Kingdin during the occupation of Scardale by the coalition forces of Cormyr, Hillsfar, Sembia, Zhentil Keep, and the other nations of the Dalelands. The forces of Cormyr were tired of the standoff with other nations, but hesitant to let the Zhents get the upper hand. However, they had left the city by the time the Shaking Plague ravaged the city in 1370 DR.\nDuring the occupation, it was led by the seasoned warrior and diplomat Truent Tyranon."
