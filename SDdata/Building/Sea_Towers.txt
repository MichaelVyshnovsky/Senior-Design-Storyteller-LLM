The '''Sea Towers''' were twin lighthouses on the islands of [[Irphong]] and [[Nemessor]] in the [[Nelanther Isles]] to mark [[Asavir's Channel]] and [[the Race]].

==Structure==
Of almost identical design and quality construction, the towers stood {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} high and {{SI|25|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. Accessed by a simple door, each had winding stair along the inside of the outer wall that gave access to the three levels. The Sea Tower of Nemessor stood atop a {{SIAdj|100|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} cliff on the island's northeastern shore, while the one on Irphong stood on the northern shore at a height of {{SI|150|foot|long=yes}} above sea level.

The topmost levels were encased with windows. Inside, the roof was illuminated by a ''[[continual light]]'', bright enough to be seen for miles around thanks to their height. This [[spell]] was [[Permanency|permanent]] and could not be dimmed or [[Dispel magic|dispelled]] without magic as strong as a ''[[wish]]''.

==History==
Built by the [[Shoon Empire]] during Emperor [[Shoon IV]]â€™s reign, the Sea Towers allowed imperial vessels to travel safely through the Race at night.

The Sea Towers were likely manned to serve as watch posts, but by the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] they were left empty, with only rotting wooden furniture marking their former occupation. However, their lights still glowed brightly. Nemessor children like to play in the Sea Tower on their island.
