The Noble Hand was a temple of Helm in the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast in the midâ€“14 century DR.
In addition to normal temple services, it operated as a school for training professional guards.
In 1367 DR, the Noble Hand was expecting to receive a shipment of evil artifacts from the Temple of the Vigilant Guard in the month of Kythorn. However, the Helmites and their cargo never arrived.
Around 1368 DR, Noble Hand was led by High Watchful Weaponmaster Ellym "Catsjaw" Thourin. It thrived under Ellyms leadership.
Noble Hand was considered to be not only one of the five major temples of Helm in the Vast in the 14 century DR, it was considered the most prominent temple of Helm in all the Realms.
