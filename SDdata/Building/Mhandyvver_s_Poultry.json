        "mainbody": "'''Mhandyvver's Poultry''' was one of two poultry stores in the town of [[Red Larch]].",
        "Geography": "Mhandyvver's Poultry was located along the [[Long Road]], next to [[Luruth's Tannery]] and across from [[Vallivoe's Sundries]].",
        "Interior": "The interior of this store resembled a barn, with numerous exposed beams and posts. Pens for livestock filled most of the building's odd corners and halls, leaving only a narrow aisle down to the back where the staff and owner lived. These living quarters were separated from the livestock pens by a workroom that had cutting benches and a central hearth.",
        "Services": "Mhandyvver's Poultry produced fowl, fresh eggs, and chicks for raising. These fowl included [[turkey]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[duck]]s whose wings had been clipped. They sold this poultry either roasted or preserved in [[oil]], while eggs were either sold fresh or [[pickle]]d. They were also known to sell pickled chicken livers.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] the store was owned and operated by [[Oskler Mhandyvver]]. He frequently hired local boys to protect his livestock from [[fox]]es, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[weasel]]s, and other predatory pests.\n\nIn the late-15{{th}} century DR, the store was operated by a descendant of his named [[Minthra Mhandyvver]] and her three children."
