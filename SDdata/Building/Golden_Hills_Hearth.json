        "mainbody": "he Golden Hills Hearth was a festhall in the underground city-state of Blingdenstone in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nRather than a building proper, the Golden Hills Hearth was housed in a sprawling burrow, with an entry door that was sized for those of gnomish height.\nThis festhall catered largely to the young, unattached men of svirfneblin society. In addition to favors for coin, the festhall also functioned as a tavern, theater, and casino. Their services were rated by travelers as being excellent and moderately priced, offering up quite the cozy environment.\nAny large surface dwellers that came into the establishment would usually find themselves shooed off by the proprietor and redirected to Blingdenstones local alehouse, the Foaming Mug.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the mistress of the festhall was one Splitshale. The coin-lasses who worked at this festhall went by the collective title \"Ladies of the Golden Hills\", which was in reference to the fabled lost goddesses of the Gnome pantheon."
