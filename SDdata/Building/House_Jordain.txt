House Jordain was an academy for the Jordain viziers located on the southern coast of Halruaa, looking over the Great Sea. This is where the viziers were educated, both in the world at large as well as in the political machinations of their home kingdom.
Although the academy formally answered to the Netyarch, in reality they were an independent institution that only answered to the magehounds.
The word "jordain" originated from the Old Netherese language, the progenitor language to the Halruaan language. It meant "fool," however the meaning of the word was different in the days of the ancient empire. A fool was a counselor and entertainer of kings, an individual who advised their lord through witting satire of song and dance.
