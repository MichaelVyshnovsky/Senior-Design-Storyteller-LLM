The '''shrine of Torm''' near [[Shadowdale]] was a small stone temple with a thatched roof, that had [[Torm]]'s [[holy symbol]] carved in the facade above the southeastern-facing doorway. 

==Appearance==
The [[granite]] building was surrounded by a colorful, sweetly fragrant flowerbed, and was tended weekly by local [[druid]]s. About twenty feet (six meters) east from the temple was a tall [[oak]] tree, that provided total shade for the structure. Enchantments on the building kept the inside of the building comfortable at any time of year.

==History==
The shrine itself was erected in [[1359 DR]] by the local faithful of Torm as a means to provide safety for the many travelers entering Shadowdale. They imbued the building with its protective magic. Not long after, druids of [[Chauntea]] passing by thought it looked bare and planted the flowers and oak tree, which was expedited by their [[magic]], specifically the ''[[plant growth]]'' [[spell]].

==Magic==
Anyone attempting to vandalize, or defile the shrine were permanently ''blinded'' until they personally fixed the damage for which they were responsible. Also, anyone attempting to pick more than a couple flowers from the garden became ''entangled'' as per the [[entangle|spell]]. Lastly, any attempt to chop down or destroy the oak tree caused it to reveal itself as an angry [[treant]].

The shrine was a haven to any who stayed inside, offering protection from local wildlife and beasts.

Although it was not known to all, this temple was actually a symbol of the partnership of natural divine powers. The shrine itself was a place of worship for four different deities: Torm, Chauntea, [[Silvanus]] and [[Mielikki]]. Each of these divine powers were represented in some way. Torm by the stout building, Chauntea by the beautiful flowerbed, Silvanus by the protective oak tree and Mielikki by the vengeful treant.
