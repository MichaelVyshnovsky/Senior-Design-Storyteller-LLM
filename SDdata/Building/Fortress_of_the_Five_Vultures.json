        "mainbody": "The '''Fortress of the Five Vultures''' was a castle in the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]]. Calauntans jokingly called it '''\"the Sevensroost\"'''.",
        "Description": "It lay on the eastern end of Calaunt, and was the largest structure in the city. It was a massive baronial-style castle. The fortress was joined by a weathered, flying stone bridge to the Keep of the Scepter.",
        "Activities": "During the 14th century [[DR]], the fortress served as the headquarters of the [[Supreme Scepter]] and the [[Merchant Duke]]s, as well as a barracks and jail.",
        "History": "Prior to Calaunt's rise as a city, it was held by a band of robber-barons. They constructed the Fortress of the Five Vultures, and it was named for them.\n\nAround the 1330s DR, [[Bellas's Band]], an [[adventuring company]], took over Calaunt, and occupied the Fortress as their headquarters. Thereafter, locals called it \"the Sevensroost\".",
        "Inhabitants": "Supreme Scepter [[Bellas Thanatar]] dwelled in the Keep of the Scepter. The Merchant Dukes lived in palatial houses close to the fortress.\n\nThe [[wizard]]s [[Thogaf]] and [[Yrlamar]] were once held in the dungeons below the fortress for a long time.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|549|Thogaf}}",
