        "mainbody": "'''Phlambror's''' was a tavern in [[Khôltar]] that catered primarily to a [[dwarven]] clientele.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|74-75}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 58: Khôltar, Part 9, Tarrying Nigh Handrornlar}}",
        "Location": "Starting at Handrornlar (the north gate out of Khôltar) and walking southwest down [[Orntathtar Way]], the first building on the right (northwest) was the inn called [[Taurgaur's Tarjteir]], and then immediately adjacent to the inn was Phlambror's.",
        "Atmosphere": "By the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], Phlambror's was a raucous tavern where dwarves felt at home, with loud singing, brawling, telling of tall tales, and drinking. Other races were not turned away, and many would bring in a tankard to have it filled and then depart, but most non-dwarves were not entirely comfortable being in the company of drunken dwarves that were just as likely to be belligerent and gloomy as boisterous and jolly.",
        "Services": "Among the strong drinks that could be purchased here was a particularly sweet and thick liquor, called [[garlraw]], that most non-dwarves could not stomach. If a patron became incapacitated, the staff would kindly clean them up and either carry them to their room at the Tarjteir next door, or put them in the tavern's loft, known as the \"groan-and-snore\", to sleep it off.",
        "History": "[[Phlambror]] was the name of the previous owner, a handsome [[human]] that was a notorious womanizer. His philandering days were cut short by a jealous husband, but in his will the lady's man forgave all his debtors and left all his property investments to the stakeholders. This included his tavern, then named The Hand of Welcome, which he bequeathed to three dwarves that frequented the bar for many hours whenever they were in Khôltar. The new owners renamed the establishment after him and it became a favorite \"home away from home\" for dwarves visiting from the [[Great Rift]]."
