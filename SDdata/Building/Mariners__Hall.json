But this is contradicted by the cited sources. The building was in a wattle-and-daub style\nThe main floor of the Mariners Hall featured full tavern facilities, a private bar for visiting members of the Master Mariners Guild. Elsewhere in the building were accommodations, also for visiting members of the guild.\nThe Mariners Hall was among some of the more notable and recognizable buildings in the Dock Ward, considered by locals to be a landmark.\nBehind a loose stone in the minaret atop this roof was a cavity where the wizard Coril hid their spellbooks."
