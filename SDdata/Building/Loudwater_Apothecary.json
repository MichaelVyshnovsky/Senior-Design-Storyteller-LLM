        "mainbody": "'''Loudwater Apothecary''' was a shop in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] owned by [[Brosha Manx]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It stood at the southern edge of the town, beside the [[Loudwater Smithy]].",
        "Structure": "Over the door hung a sign showing a number of strangely shaped bottles to indicate its trade.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Inside, the air was heavy with scents, such as spicy [[cinnamon]], a tangy musk, [[orange]] peel, [[gunpowder]], and even baking [[bread]]."
        },
        "Services": "At Loudwater Apothecary, Brosha sold the typical [[herb]]s, [[spices]], and roots, servicing the cooks and hedge [[wizard]]s of Loudwater. It also operated as a [[perfume]]ry, providing a variety of scents.\n\nBy [[1479 DR]], Brosha had recently begun also selling charms and mystical odds-and-ends, such as claws of [[dragon]], powdered horn of [[unicorn]], and burnt-out ''[[Ioun stones]]''. Or so their labels and price-tags proclaimedâ€”their actual value and genuineness were dubious. Nevertheless, it they could provided for a few minor [[ritual]]s and competed with [[Garwan's Curiosities]], annoying [[Garwan]]."
