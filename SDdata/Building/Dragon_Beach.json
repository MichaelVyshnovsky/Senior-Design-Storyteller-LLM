        "mainbody": "Dragon Beach was the original harbor in Luskan, and was an extremely lawless place.\nThe harbor was usually crammed with small boats, cogs and caravels, and also pirate and merchant shipping.\nThe Dragon Beach served as the private harbor of the High Captains of Luskan until at least the mid&ndash14 century DR, and was used by their naval, merchant, and pirate crews. Meanwhile, foreign ships were directed to Whitesails Harbor. By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Dragon Beach had become more crowded and lawless.\nThe location was dangerous unless Luskanite soldiers kept discipline which only happened during times of war."
