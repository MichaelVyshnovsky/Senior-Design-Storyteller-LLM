'''Mantor's Library''' was the preeminent place of learning in the city of [[Phlan]].{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|11}} It was a repository for the knowledge about the city, the [[Moonsea North]], and all manner of academic fields from the mundane to the fantastic.

==Location==
The library was situated in the center of [[Scholar's Square]], in the [[Phlan/Old City|Old City]] of Phlan.

==Structure==
Beneath the library proper was the sub-basement that housed its extensive archives.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|18}} Deeper still beneath the basement was the network of sewer tunnels that ran beneath Phlan, and ruins formed from the numerous times the city had been destroyed.{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Phlan|14}}{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|19}}

==Interior==
Upon entering the library seekers of knowledge were greeted with the scholar's garden, a serene indoor space for quiet reflection complete with a reflecting pool.

To the left of the scholar's garden were the ground-level book shelves, containing scores of books covering subjects from philosophy, mathematics, history, geography and even some rhetorical works. Along the back wall opposite the entrance were several reading chambers and the scribes hall, a workplace used by the library's resident scholars, and the cramped personal study of Phlan's resident Master of Scribes, also referred to as the Scribe Master. On the right side of the garden were a series of personal compartments that offered the privacy needed for engrossing studies or the focus needed by the library's skilled illuminators.

The underground archives were set within a large square room that resembled a pyramid set atop a box. Along each of the {{SI|100|ft}} tall walls were multiple thousands of [[tome]]s, [[scroll]]s, and historical documents of great significance.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|19}}

==Activities==
The library was often bustling with activity, as the city's scribes always had some scholarly duties that had to be performed. Novice scribes were enlisted to transcribe documents and perform other less-than-exciting tasks. The amount of energy that all the library's scribes poured into their work was truly exceptional.

It was funded by nominal fees that were charged for the scribes' work in conjunction with generous donations put forth by the city's wealthier citizens.

==History==
Following Phlan's destruction during the [[Dragon Run]] in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, Mantor's Library like much of the city, was left in absolute ruin.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|79}}

A half-century later, in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the scribes of the library and the city's resident [[wizard]] [[Denlor]] worked together to create the Secret Cache within the library's archives.

During Phlan's occupation by the malevolent spirit [[Tyranthraxus]], [[Porphyrys Cadorna]] enlisted a group of adventures to delve into Mantor's Library in order to find more information about the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' beneath [[Valjevo Castle]] and restore the fame and fortune of [[House Cadorna]].

After the [[Zhentarim]] took control of Phlan in the {{yearlinkName|1380}}, the archives of Mantor's library was the site of a tragic book-burning led by the city's inaugural Lord Protector, [[Cvaal Daoran]]. The zealous [[Banite]] destroyed documents that were critical of the [[Zhent]] organization along with those that were critical of their politics.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5}}

Sometime during the early 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} the [[Cult of the Dragon]] directed two of their agents, [[Tibeem]] and [[Spernik]] to infiltrate the library and discern the location of the ruined [[Temple of the Scale]] in the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5}} At the same time a series of books, including the ''[[History of the North]]'', ''[[Lex Geographica]]'',{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5,8}} were reported as being stolen from the library's shelves.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|8}}

Another of the dragon cultists [[Ellison Berenger]] also came into the city under false pretenses, hiding among the library's scribes for a matter of months. He used that time to track down the memoirs written by [[Ren o' the Blade]],{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|10}} with the inadvertent assistance of the senior librarian [[Garda Greenleaf]]. The deplorable cultist then killed the beloved Garda before fleeing from the scene of the crime.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|17}}

After the cult's patron [[Vorgansharax]] took control of Phlan, the [[green dragon]] known as the "Maimed Virulence" stripped the Lord Sage of Phlan of their office and occupied Mantor's Library with a squad of the [[Tears of Virulence]] soldiery.{{Cite adventurers league/Escape from Phlan|13}}
