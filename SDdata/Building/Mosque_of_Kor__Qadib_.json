The man assured the adventurers that his priesthood had no issue with Hakim, but a [[hakima]] among them detected deceit and pressed the imam for more information. The man relented and revealed that it may have been the work of overzealous Kor worshipers, the [[Wrath of the Old]], but knew nothing more than that they were rumored to be headquartered somewhere in the [[Furrowed Mountains]]."
