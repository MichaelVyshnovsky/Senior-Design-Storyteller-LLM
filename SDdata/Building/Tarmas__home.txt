Tarmas home was one of the houses in the village of West Harbor on the Sword Coast North. It belonged to Tarmas.
Located in the center of the village, Tarmas home was located between the Starling house and Piersons home.
Like the other houses in West Harbor, Tarmas home was wooden.
The building was small. It was composed of a bedroom, a laboratory and a library.
Tarmas and the Kalach-Chas friend, Amie Fern, lived in this house. When duergar and bladelings attacked the village in 1374 DR, Tarmas ordered the Kalach-Cha to retrieve some supplies from his house, which would aid them in the battle. The supplies were books, scrolls, potions and a magical mandolin.
