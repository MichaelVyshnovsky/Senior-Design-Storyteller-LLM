        "mainbody": "Khalids Wall was an ancient ruined wall that was built to separate the Dragons Head Peninsula from the rest of Tethyr.\nA small village of Jhaansciim stood about a mile southwest of the southern end of Khalids Wall. The town was famed for a special type of stew served at The Wallside inn, named after Khalids. The wall was built in the middle of the Tethyr Peninsula, on its so-called  Neck, south of the town of Murann.\nExperienced rangers and foresters could easily walk the length of the wall through the overgrown wild thicket in one day. By the late 14 century DR, the wall was a long crumbling structure that stretched across the Necks forests. Its foundations showed sight of heavy wear and decay. Most casual travelers unfamiliar with the regions history could assume that the southern part of Khalids Wall was just huge blocks of bedrock pushed up from the ground and smoothed by the sea and wind.\nThe wall once had two  tall guard towers that rose about the rest of the structure, but by the 14 century, they were nothing but the tallest points of the ruins. The towers structure had a Calishite design, with the walls sloping inward as the towers rose up, ending in battlements. Both towers stood on the southern end of the wall by the forests edge, almost reaching the Firedrake Road that passed along the entirety of the Tethyr Peninsula. With centuries passing, the towers became concealed by the forest, and most travelers passed them without even knowing of the towers existence. A trail of crumbling mason stones led from the Firedrake Road, through the forest, and towards the crumbling watch towers.\nBy 14 century DR, the guard towers were long-looted and held little, apart from two still functioning freshwater wells.\nThe construction of Khalids Wall began in the , in attempts by Calimshan to put a border between them and the peninsulas natives. By the , the construction was abandoned due to elven attacked on the builders. The wall was never completed and by the late 14 it was a decaying ruin, sometimes used by weary travelers as shelter. Lower floors of the walls towers could be used as a shelter, while the top floors were damaged by time and elements, offering little in terms of shelter, and posed the danger of broken floor and rotten support beams. However, both towers had functioning bake-ovens and pantry-cellars. The main danger of the wall came from the fact that bandits and brigands knew of the towers well, and the ruins offered shelter to wild beats."
