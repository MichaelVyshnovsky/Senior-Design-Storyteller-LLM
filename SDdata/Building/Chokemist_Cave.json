        "mainbody": "he Chokemist Cave was home to one of the last colonies of chokemist plants in Samarach as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe cave stood to the north of the Snout of Omgar in the jungles of Samarach. The entrance into the deadly abyss was an opening in the northern side of a low but rocky mountain. Strange green mist bellowed rhythmically from the caves entrance.\nThe cave was filled with toxic clouds of green spores, a type of deadly poison produced by chokemist plants. The plants resembled thick, twisting, woody roots with strange blossoming green flowers. The poised poison-filled cave was home to a colony of corrupted giant spiders, addicted and withered by the swirling spores.\nIn the , the Chokemist Cave was used as a base by a yuan-ti pureblood infiltrator named Luaire Farwander who covertly sabotaged merchant operations of one of the merchant companies of Samargol. Luaire kept the addicted giant spiders as his pets and used chokemist to poison the artificer operator of a hidden Lantanese portal."
