        "mainbody": "'''Bloodril's Snug Haven''' was an inn located in the town of [[Bryn Shander]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was one of the oldest establishments within the town's walls.",
        "Structure": "Like many of Bryn Shander's inns, the Snug Haven was poorly constructed. It stood high above ground level, which offered little protection from icy winds and freezing temperatures.",
        "Atmosphere": "The poor construction of the ironically named ''Snug Haven'' left guests of the inn cold and shivering."
