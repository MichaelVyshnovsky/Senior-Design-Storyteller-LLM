        "mainbody": "Bloodrils Snug Haven was an inn located in the town of Bryn Shander during the 14 century DR. It was one of the oldest establishments within the towns walls.\nLike many of Bryn Shanders inns, the Snug Haven was poorly constructed. It stood high above ground level, which offered little protection from icy winds and freezing temperatures.\nThe poor construction of the ironically named Snug Haven left guests of the inn cold and shivering."
