        "Services": "Although ''[[teleport]]ation'' was popular, many within Netheril preferred to transport themselves or their goods via less overtly magical means. As such, flying ships like those made by Gallery Steamers remained in use for both passengers and cargo. [[Stuckley]] and his two supervisors [[Rousselet]] and [[Flue]] oversaw the company's operations, with [[Apulee]], [[Fourcrow]], [[Gau]], and [[Bruck]] managing the employees who built and enchanted the ship hulls."
