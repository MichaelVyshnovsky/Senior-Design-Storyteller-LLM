        "mainbody": "he Nine Fires  was a fine inn of Arabel that provided good service at low prices.\nThe inn was on the outermost street of Arabel, just inside of the southeastern city walls, and a block east along the same street from the Wink and Kiss tavern.\nThe Nine Fires was a cozy and heavily-decorated place to relax and find rooms. The nine fires for which it was named were a set of hearths placed in the large common room and in the corridors upstairs, and with the tending of the staff kept the inn very warm in winter. A mage was kept on-staff specifically to watch the fires and contain any accidents and disasters in the making, armed with a decanter of endless water, a wand of frost, and a selection of fire-fighting spells.\nThough a quiet and under-appreciated spot in Arabel, the Niner offered surprisingly good service at low prices, and guests recieved freshly-made hot meals upstairs via dumbwaiter.\nThe inn kept a collection of well-used books that guests were encouraged to read during their stays. They tended to be Chessentan-style swashbuckling tales popular in Faer√ªn, such as The Nymph Said No and The Moonlight Morningstar Murders. They were cheap, battered, and full of fanciful nonsense rather than useful lore, but even so the guests were warned that the guardian mage of the inn would magically track down any missing books and ensure their return.\nThe Niner was built around the mid-14 century DR when the wealthy adventurer Thurbrand made Arabel his base for excursions into the Stonelands, but couldnt find any lodgings to his tastes. He kept a suite at the inn for himself, in addition to at least one house elsewhere in the city."
