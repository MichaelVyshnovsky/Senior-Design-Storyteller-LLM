Circa 1374 DR, it was the only bookseller in town, and was run by Amnic and Mela Basult.\nEarly in the month of Eleint in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, Amnic went missing he was last seen in his shop, where signs of a scuffle could be found. Although distraught, Mela tried to manage the bookshop in Amnics absence.\nEventually, on Eleint 6, adventurers discovered that the new Temple of Mystra in town was actually a front for priests of Shar and Cyric to kidnap magic-users and spirit them away to the Vast Swamp for some nefarious purpose. Investigators found Amnics body in a torture chamber beneath the false temple. Mela was informed of her husbands fate."
