        "mainbody": "he Worried Wyvern was an average-quality inn located in the town of Hills Edge in the Sunset Vale.\nThe uppermost floor comprised interconnected suites of rooms, while the ground floor had a nice dining room.\nThe inn offered a messenger pigeon service for sending communications and errands to Iriaebor.\nThe Worried Wyvern was perhaps best known for its food. Morning and Highsun meals often included bacon, sausage, and toasted bread with drippings, as well as a signature omelet of asparagus and spiced fish. Evening meals featured roasted meats and dishes like chicken liver with mushroom sauce or green peppers stuffed with rice, tomato, and ground meat.\nThe inn was fairly new as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, at which time it was regarded by Volo as the most average inn in town. It was known as a clean, safe, pleasant, and overall unexciting place to stay. The otherwise very good experience of eating in the dining room was marred by a particularly bad harpist."
