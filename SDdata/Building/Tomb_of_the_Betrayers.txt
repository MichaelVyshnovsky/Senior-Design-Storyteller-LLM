'''Tomb of the Betrayers''' was a crypt in [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

==Location==
The tomb was located in Neverwinter, near the [[Hall of Justice|Church of Tyr]].

==Structure==
A stone tomb, composed of graves near the entrance.

==Interior==
The tomb was composed of several halls and rooms, guarded by undead and having many traps.

==History==
The tomb was built to symbolize the fates of those that betrayed Neverwinter.

When [[Judge Oleff Uskar]] sent [[Onan]], a priest of [[Tyr]], to investigate disturbances, the dead sealed the entrance, prohibiting Onan to escape. The Kalach-Cha could've rescued him, if a ghost by the name [[Fenthick Moss]] would be defeated first.
