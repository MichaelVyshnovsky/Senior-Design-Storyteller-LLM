Tomb of the Betrayers was a crypt in Neverwinter on the Sword Coast.
The tomb was located in Neverwinter, near the Church of Tyr.
A stone tomb, composed of graves near the entrance.
The tomb was composed of several halls and rooms, guarded by undead and having many traps.
The tomb was built to symbolize the fates of those that betrayed Neverwinter.
When Judge Oleff Uskar sent Onan, a priest of Tyr, to investigate disturbances, the dead sealed the entrance, prohibiting Onan to escape. The Kalach-Cha couldve rescued him, if a ghost by the name Fenthick Moss would be defeated first.
