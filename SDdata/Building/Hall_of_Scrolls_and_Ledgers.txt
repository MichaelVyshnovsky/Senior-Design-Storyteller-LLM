The '''Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers''' was a room inside [[Castle Obarskyr]] in {{yearlink|1357}}.

==Location==
It was distant from the [[Chamber of the Brazen Fool]].

==Defenses==
The wards in the chamber were powerful enough to give [[Vangerdahast]] pause and keep him from so much as attempting any spellcasting.

==History==
On [[Marpenoth 17]] {{yearlink|1357}}, [[Vangerdahast]] was informed of a hand merged with the floor of the Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers. This alarmed him, because of the extensive and thorough wards on the place; the hand later turned out to belong to a [[Red Wizard]] of [[Thay]] named [[Adrelgus]].
