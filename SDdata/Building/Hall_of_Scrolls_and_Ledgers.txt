The Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers was a room inside Castle Obarskyr in .
It was distant from the Chamber of the Brazen Fool.
The wards in the chamber were powerful enough to give Vangerdahast pause and keep him from so much as attempting any spellcasting.
On Marpenoth 17 , Vangerdahast was informed of a hand merged with the floor of the Hall of Scrolls and Ledgers. This alarmed him, because of the extensive and thorough wards on the place the hand later turned out to belong to a Red Wizard of Thay named Adrelgus.
