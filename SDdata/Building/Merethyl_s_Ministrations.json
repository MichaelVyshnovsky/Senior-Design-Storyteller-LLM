        "mainbody": "Merethyls Ministrations was the most expensive and luxurious public bath house found in the city of Myth Drannor circa the midâ€“7 century DR.\nThe establishment was built in the Kerradunath district of the city, where the Street of Song intersected with Srinshees Stroll.\nThis exquisite structure was built as an adapted tree-dwelling, utilizing the boughs and branches as the form for its open-air ivory bathing pools. It stood three-stories tall, with the first level built some  above street level, with a floating disc that carried patrons to a main entrance nearly nearly  above that.\nEntering into the main structure from above, patrons received an experience that was the epitome of decadence and extravagant pleasure."
