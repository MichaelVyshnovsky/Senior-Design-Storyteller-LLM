The '''Temple of Tymora''' in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] was a place of worship dedicated to [[Tymora]], the [[god]]dess of good fortune.

==Location==
The temple lay on the floor of the ravine that defined the slum district of [[Port Nyanzaru/Malar's Throat|Malar's Throat]].

==Structure==
It was a sturdy and fortified structure of heavy stone that emphasized safety over elegance.

==Services==
The temple was known to reward those who protected or served the people of Malar's Throat, such as with gifts of [[tej]] or ''[[healing potion]]s''.

Whenever Malar's Throat came under attack from [[undead]] or flooded during heavy rains, the Temple of Tymora served as a safe refuge for those who were not able to flee the ravine.

==History==
In the century following the disappearance of [[Ubtao]], Tymora became one of the more popular [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian gods]] among the people of Port Nyanzaru, and the poor folk of Malar's Throat came to ascribe what little luck they had in life to her. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city owing to a history of exploitation, and so the [[Church of Tymora|Tymoran]] [[priest]]hood had come to be composed of native [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]].
