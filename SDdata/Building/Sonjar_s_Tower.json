        "mainbody": "'''Sonjar's Tower''' was a tower belonging to an [[Imaskari]] [[artificer (Imaskari)|artificer]], located inside a geode. As of {{yearlink|1372}}, it was abandoned, the master of the tower long-dead.",
        "Location": "The tower was located inside a geode in the shadows of the [[Giant's Belt]] mountains, on top of an [[earth node]] of great power.",
        "Interior": "The tower had marble floors and beautifully painted frescoes, which had grown worn with time, but ''[[unseen servant]]'' spells had kept it clean for millennia. It eschewed doors, using [[portal]]s instead.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|73}} One-way portals to the Elemental Planes of [[Elemental Plane of Air|Air]], [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Fire]] and [[Elemental Plane of Water|Water]] served a number of functions inside the geode, renewing the air and providing heat and fresh water. Inside the tower, numerous portals carried food, refuse, and people; the top level included portals to other locations throughout the [[Imaskari Empire]]. Not all of the portals were stable by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]; some of the portals required instructions to activate, which would only be accepted in [[Roushoum]]. Atop the tower entrance, a sign read \"Sonjar, Artificer, Master of the Amethyst Tower\".\n\nA circular [[demiplane]] held the artificer's orchard. There was a room devoted to the torture of priests. Most books in the library became too brittle to handle. The forge room was in a malfunctioning extradimensional space, which dropped its contents periodically back into the artifice chamber. Notably, the artificer's trophy room included the preserved head of some angelic creature.",
        "Inhabitants": "Though the master of the tower was gone for good, in [[1372 DR]] a group of [[drow]] mercenaries called [[Durdyn's Devils]] had come to search the towers for Imaskari magic on behalf of House [[Vrasl]]. They hoped that such magic would help explain [[Lolth]]'s silence.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|72}} A [[brown dragon]] had been hired as their guide.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|77}} The only other inhabitants of the geode were [[undead]], including four slaves, now [[spectres]], and a [[curst]] slavemaster. All of them died during the rebellion of {{yearlink|-2488}}.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerun|75}}"
