The '''Seminarcane''' was a six-building complex in [[Keltar]] dedicated to magical education.

==Description==
The outer walls were composed of simple brickwork, but the interiors of most of the buildings were decorated by elaborate mosaics.

==Structures==
Three of the six buildings were the following:
; Minargent : This was the business headquarters of the [[Guild Arcane]] in Keltar.
; shrine to [[Azuth]] : Only Guild Arcane members or students of the school were permitted to use this shrine, which was said to contain magical kneeling-stone mosaics to increase one's ability to communicate with the Lord of Spells.
; students' dormitory: This was the only building on campus not decorated with mosaics internally, to minimize distractions for the learners.

==History==
The Seminarcane was built during the [[Seventh Age of Calimshan]].
