The '''Red Pillar Halls''' was an important bureaucratic location in the [[City of Brass]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

The Red Pillar Halls were found within [[Furnace (district)|the Furnace ward]] of the city.

==Activities==
The Red Pillar Halls served as the court of the [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan|Sultan of the Efreet]]. Additionally, bureaucrats collected taxes, made appointments, and dealt justice here. Any [[efreeti]] hoping to address their grievances here was subjected to an extensive search and needed to dish out hefty bribes to make it into the building.
