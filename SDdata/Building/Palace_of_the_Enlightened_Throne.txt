The Palace of the Enlightened Throne, also known as the Palace of the Grand Caliph and the Seat of the Great Lion, was the seat of the Grand Caliph of all of Zakhara. 
The Palace appeared as a small city when viewed from the court, covering several acres of land. All of the rooftops were covered with gold. The Palace was joined by rich gardens that were accessible by the general public.
Found in the capital city of Huzuz, it was the center of power for a whole continent. 
Five centuries of building activity led to this splendid, expansive and varied complex. As of 1367 DR, no more changes had been made by Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir and his two predecessors.
The citizens of Huzuz took great pride in the Palace and it was beloved by all. It was often referred to as "our palace" by the al-hadhar.
