Though this map is highly stylized, by comparing it to other maps of Ravens Bluff one can approximate the shop's location as being in the Gowntown neighborhood of the city's Temple District. The stylized nature of the ''Gateway'' map makes it hard to narrow down the roads it stands along, but due to the building being located to the left of what looks to be [[Kristen's Circle]], the road heading south-west from the circle and past the building would most likely be Fire Lane.

'''Of Style and Grace''' was a [[magic]] shop in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] that specialized in [[spell component]]s. The shop's name was a play on words of the owner's name, [[Grace Stiles]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Good Day To Die|18}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Birds of a Feather|16}}

==Location==
This shop was located roughly within the [[Gowntown]] neighborhood of the city's [[Ravens Bluff/Temple District|Temple District]], standing along [[Fire Lane]].<ref group="note" name="location" />

==Structure==
This shop stood within a fairly good-sized stone building with six pillars that stood outside.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Good Day To Die|17}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Birds of a Feather|15}} Upon opening the entry door, a small [[bell]] would ring. 

The interior of the building had a vaulted ceiling and was divided into two sections, with the front serving as the shop and the rear serving as both the living quarters of the owner and the store's storage space. A narrow hallway led into the back half of the building, separated by a counter. The counter was modest and not very functional, serving only to deter patrons from wandering into the backroom.

The shop had a large pentagram carved into its wooden flooring, with the outline filled with [[silver]]. A large red [[velvet]] chair stood at its center, along with a small stand with a [[silver]] [[bowl]] of [[peach]]es. The owner could often be found sitting there, reading some magical [[book|tome]].

==Services==
Of Style and Grace specialized in selling spell components, though it did not keep them on open display. Rather Grace would fetch the desired components from storage and do transactions with a purse she wore around her waist at all times.

==Reputation==
Among some, the shop carried a reputation of dealing in [[evil]] magic,{{Cite organized play/LC/Birds of a Feather|17}} considering them to be little more than harmless fun.

==History==
Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s visited Of Style and Grace under the direction of [[John Porter]] in hopes of finding a means to cure [[Marian Wicksal]] of [[poison]] she had ingested.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Good Day To Die|19}}

Later, another group of adventurers visited Of Style and Grace after being told by [[Aaron Fleeting]] that it was where the [[illusionist]] con artist [[Mortimer Mittlemer]] typically shopped for spell components, but this was a clever lie meant to give Fleeting time to make distance between him and the adventurers. When questioned, Grace denied knowing anything about Aaron, his sister [[Erin Fleetwing]], or Mortimer, though expressed resentment over being associated with the con artist.
