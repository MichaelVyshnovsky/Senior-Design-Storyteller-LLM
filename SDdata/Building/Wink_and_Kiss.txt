The Wink and Kiss, or the Wink and the Kiss, was a tavern and festhall in Yartar that fell under the protection of the Hand of Yartar. It attracted those individuals who were supportive of and often benefited from the criminal organization.
It was located just east of the Fishyard, Yartars open-air marketplace.
The Wink and Kiss was a maze–like collection of compact rooms, concealed side-passages, and sequestered passageways.
The festhall was a bawdy and fun establishment that didnt take itself too seriously. It was a great place for those who wanted to find easy-going friends for the evening.
Due to its distinguished patrons however, the Wink and Kiss was declared a safe haven for anyone who entered. Weapons were checked at the door and rowdy behavior was not tolerated.
As of the mid–14 century DR, it was run by two brothers, Asklar and Beldorm.
