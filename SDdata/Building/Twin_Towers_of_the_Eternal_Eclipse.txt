The Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse were a pair of towers hidden high in the Small Teeth mountains, one on each side of the Trade Way.
The towers were about 5 mi (8 km) apart, deep in the highest peaks of the Small Teeth Mountains between Amn and Muranndin. The towers were almost completely obscured from view, even from above.
Each tower was five stories tall and they were connected by a twisting underground passage.
As of 1370 DR, Blackwill Haarken Akhmelere was in charge of the church of Cyric congregation.
Originally temples dedicated to Bane, Cyricists conquered the towers in 1362 DR and rededicated them to the worship of Cyric.
In 1373 DR the Sojourner destroyed the western tower to get at the magical granite it was made out of.
During the Rage of Dragons, Iryklathagra badly damaged the eastern tower but on Uktar 13 of the same year, Akhmelere used the Golden Lamp of Samesaj to rebuild the western tower and repair the eastern tower.
On Flamerule 12 of 1374 DR, after a fifty day siege, the Army of Three Stars successfully conquered the western tower, handing it over to Cyricist members of the crusade.
One of the towers was stolen by Mask and moved first to the Wayrock, then to the Shadowfell. The assassin and priest of Mask Drasek Riven became its sole inhabitant.
