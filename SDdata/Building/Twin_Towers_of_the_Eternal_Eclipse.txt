The '''Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse''' were a pair of towers hidden high in the [[Small Teeth]] mountains, one on each side of the [[Trade Way]].

==Location==
The towers were about 5 mi (8 km) apart, deep in the highest peaks of the Small Teeth Mountains between [[Amn]] and [[Muranndin]]. The towers were almost completely obscured from view, even from above.

==Structure==
Each tower was five stories tall and they were connected by a twisting underground passage.

==Inhabitants==
As of [[1370 DR]], Blackwill [[Haarken Akhmelere]] was in charge of the [[church of Cyric]] congregation.

==History==
Originally temples dedicated to [[Bane]], [[Church of Cyric|Cyricists]] conquered the towers in [[1362 DR]] and rededicated them to the worship of [[Cyric]].

In [[1373 DR]] the [[Sojourner]] destroyed the western tower to get at the magical [[granite]] it was made out of.<ref>

During the [[Rage of Dragons]], [[Iryklathagra]] badly damaged the eastern tower<ref> but on [[Uktar 13]] of the same year, Akhmelere used the ''[[Golden Lamp of Samesaj]]'' to rebuild the western tower and repair the eastern tower.<ref>

On Flamerule 12 of [[1374 DR]], after a fifty day siege, the [[Army of Three Stars]] successfully conquered the western tower, handing it over to Cyricist members of the crusade.<ref>

One of the towers was stolen by [[Mask]] and moved first to the [[Wayrock]], then to the [[Shadowfell]]. The [[assassin]] and [[priest]] of [[Mask]] [[Drasek Riven]] became its sole inhabitant.{{Fact}}
