'''Shaliber's Ship''' was an inn within a semi-permanently moored merchant's [[cog]] located in [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Ship was moored at [[Bolliver's Wharf]], across the street where the [[Court Close]] reached the harbors of the [[Dragonmere]] in southern Suzail, on [[Silverscales Street]]. The inn stood about a city block away from [[The Black Rat]] to the northwest and [[The Osculatory]] a block to the northeast.

==Description==
The floating leaky inn collected payments before the stay but asked no questions of its guests, whether guests brought [[sword]]s, chained up captives, or came prepared for a brawl. The inn was a noisy place with commonly seen vermin. Still, it had its charm. Notably, the inn's staff tended to empty guests' chamberpots by splashing their contents off the gangplank just as Suzail's [[Purple Dragons]] showed up to investigate Shaliber's guests.

==History==
Shaliber's Ship was named after [[Shaliber]], a captain who could not pay his debt to [[Maerun Stoutbold]] sometime before [[1366 DR]]. Shaliber promised to one night sneak aboard the repossessed Ship and sail it into the sea, with all staff and guests aboard.

The inn received a favorable review from [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in his guidebook dedicated to Cormyr, published in the 1360s DR.
