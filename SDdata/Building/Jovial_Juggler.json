        "mainbody": "The '''Jovial Juggler''' was an inn located on the northern side of the town of [[Beregost]]. While it could be considered quite the average establishment, it was quite popular among the Beregostan youth.",
        "Description": "Located on the west side of Beregost's main road, the inn was easily recognizable. It featured a grand roofboard depicting a juggling jester that could hardly be missed.",
        "Activities": "The Juggler was the inn of choice for those who wanted to drink, dance and spend their evening in revelry. Minstrels and other performers were featured nearly nightly, and well-paid for their performances. Revelers were treated to meals of whole roasted [[pig]]s, [[boar]]s, and [[oxen]].",
        "History": "In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], Officer [[Jessa Vai]] of the [[Baldurian]] [[Flaming Fist]] set up shop within the Jovial Juggler to help deal with the bandit problem that plagued the [[Sword Coast]]. She offered bounties for bandit scalps for some time, before she was asked to report back to her superiors in the city.\n\nThat same year, the [[paladin]] [[Bjornin]] stayed in the inn to recover from the wounds he had received from a band of [[half-ogre]]s west of town."
