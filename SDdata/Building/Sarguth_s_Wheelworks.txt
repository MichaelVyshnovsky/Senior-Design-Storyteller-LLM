'''Sarguth's Wheelworks''' was a wainwright shop found in [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]] as of [[1368 DR]].

==Description==
The shop was found in the southern portion of the town right off of the main road.

==Activities==
In addition to making wheels, Sarguth's used an assembly-line approach to quickly repair and refit [[wagon]]s, including mounting new wheels for the customer. For a hefty fee of 25 [[gold piece]]s per hour, customers could request their project be pushed to the front of the line while they waited.

==Inhabitants==
A fat old man named [[Sarguth]] owned the establishment.
