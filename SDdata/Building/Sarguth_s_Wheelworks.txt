Sarguths Wheelworks was a wainwright shop found in Essembra in Battledale as of 1368 DR.
The shop was found in the southern portion of the town right off of the main road.
In addition to making wheels, Sarguths used an assembly-line approach to quickly repair and refit wagons, including mounting new wheels for the customer. For a hefty fee of 25 gold pieces per hour, customers could request their project be pushed to the front of the line while they waited.
A fat old man named Sarguth owned the establishment.
