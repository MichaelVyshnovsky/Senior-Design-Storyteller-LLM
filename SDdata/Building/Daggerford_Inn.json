        "mainbody": "The Daggerford Inn was a large inn found in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nAnyone entering Daggerford through the main Caravan Gate was greeted with the main face of the Daggerford Inn as soon as they entered the city. The inn was located at the junction of Dukes Way and Wall Street across from the market.\nPlenty of thick tapestries hung around the walls aided in blocking sound from the city, ensuring guests would get a good nights sleep. A small stove was found in each room.\nThe Daggerford Inn was owned by a dwarf named Demetira Landscraper."
