Dao mazeworks were the homes of noble dao who lived far from the vast Sevenfold Mazework.
These structures were typically located somewhere on the Elemental Plane of Earth, but could be found on other planes as well. Zakhara on the Prime Material Plane housed dao mazeworks.
In addition to the leading noble dao, a dao mazework usually held at least 40 dao accompanied by earth elementals, other vassals and slaves, and several sandmen.
