        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Helm''' in [[Bezantur]] was the largest temple dedicated to [[Helm]] in all of [[Thay]]. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple saw itself as a speck of lawfulness amidst the chaos of Beznatur.",
        "Location": "The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, namely the [[Temple of Shar (Bezantur)|Temple of Shar]] to the southwest, the [[Temple of Auril (Bezantur)|Temple of Auril]] to the south, the [[Temple of Lliira (Bezantur)|Temple of Lliira]] to the east, the [[Temple of Oghma (Bezantur)|Temple of Oghma]] to the northeast, and [[Ilmater's Cathedral]] to the north.",
        "Structure": "The temple was likened to a small citadel.",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], worship of Helm was frowned upon but mostly permitted within Thay, and he was worshiped by soldiers, mercenaries, tax-collectors, and folk from elsewhere along the [[Inner Sea]]. However, his worship declined precipitously following the Time of Troubles when the people of Thay saw him as responsible for the deaths of [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]]&mdash;all of whom had been popular [[gods]]. As a result, the temple in Bezantur was occasionally defaced with offal and graffiti, and its priests were the targets of constant verbal and even physical abuse.\n\nWhile the temple still stood as of the late 1360s DR, no one in Bezantur worshiped Helm save for the six warrior-priests who stubbornly maintained the building. By that time, they had decided not to abandon the City of a Thousand Temples as to do so would mean admitting that their god had lost much of his influence."
