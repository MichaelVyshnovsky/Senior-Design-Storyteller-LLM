        "mainbody": "A '''Yurt of Snow Spirits''' was a unique part of a typical [[Tuigan]] Khan's camp.",
        "Description": "This yurt was surrounded by a wicked fence decorated with [[iron]] charms. Charms also decorated the yurt itself which was blackened with [[charcoal]]. A small offering ground sat next to the yurt as well. A yurt of snow spirits always remained empty, designated as a place for the evil [[snow spirit]]s so they would leave the rest of the camp alone.",
        "History": "These were sacred yurts dedicated to the snow spirits. Unlike all of the other yurts which always had their openings facing southeast, this yurt's opening faced northwest.{{Cite interactive atlas}}"
