        "mainbody": "Karsuss Keep was a Netherese ruin near Westgate,\nIt stood west of Starmantle, The place was surrounded by shadowtop trees, and there was at least one hiexel. The keep itself stood at the top of a slope or hill.\nOne stone platform outside was engraved with a \"K\" the stone was about one man-height by two man-heights in size.\nMost of the structure had been rendered completely unusable, and all archways had lost their doors, but some of the ceilings survived. There was one bedroom that had walls with gaps through which the forest was visible, strongly implying it was on the outer edge of the structure these gaps were large enough for a man to enter, if he clambered.\nThe well had handholds and footholds.\nOne room, accessible through a translocating stone platform, was a low-ceilinged room lit by red light, which held entirely too many enchanted devices, making it almost knee-deep to wade through. There was a platform with a \"K\" on its dimmest corner.\nThe space down the well was damp and dusty, but trails of salt covered some stones, deposited by natural processes over the ages.\nOne particular room, used to hold enchanted objects, was lit only by a red radiance.\nBeyond the small town outside, there was a moat with a drawbridge and stone pillars within the ditch, which had once buttressed the walls.\nThe bedroom had wards upon the well, which attacked those who descended. There was an illusion that would trigger when people approached the rune circles and throne, but it was only bluster and threats by Karsus, who had not added actual wards to the throne room.\nOne room was accessible through a stone platform outside the Keep which was engraved with a \"K\". It was enspelled to translocate those who stepped upon it and spoke aloud \"Karsus\". However, the platform did not register as magical to detection. The room could only be left in the same way there was a floating sword as its only visible guardian.\nThe place was originally used by Karsus, who hid a clone in a secluded underground throne room and prepared rune circles describing the casting of several of his most powerful spells, including one to heal all ills,\nAt some point, Saeraede Lyonora, an undead Netherese sorceress, arrived at the Keep, finding Karsuss clone dead. She also gathered gowns in a ruined wardrobe from the caravans she exterminated nearby. She later successfully lured him into the keep.\nHowever, the ruins were also located by Sharran Dreadspells led by Elryn, who were out to slay Elminster they accidentally revealed the location of the Keep to the elven mage Ilbryn Starym, who was also seeking to hunt down and slay Elminster he hid himself in the throne room and waited for a chance to ambush the wizard, while the Dreadspells found an entrance into a cache of magical devices, allowing her to nearly strike him down. Azuth appeared then, accompanied by three mages Caladaster Daermree, Tabarast, and Beldrune. Azuth warned him that what he was doing was forbidden, and that he was doomed if he didnt break free of her. At that time, the Sharrans revealed themselves, and hurled an onslaught of destructive spells from a gap in the ceiling.\nThough Saeraede was able to absorb most of the magic released, the cavern was riven, and the runes holding Karsus greatest magics were shattered. In turn, Azuth protected the three wizards with him after the Sharrans decided theyd hurled as many spells as could be useful, they fled, noticing Azuth was still standing. In turn, Saeraede returned herself to life after draining Elminster, only to be immediately struck down by Ilbryn Starym. She then exploded in the already precarious ruins of the keep, leaving the whole chamber open to the elements Azuth disappeared with Elminster, leaving the place to the three mages that had accompanied him. These three mages, after a short talk, discovered Saeraedes gowns, which they took with themselves."
