        "Location": "It stood west of Starmantle, The place was surrounded by [[shadowtop]] [[tree]]s, and there was at least one [[hiexel]]. The keep itself stood at the top of a slope or hill.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The space down the well was damp and dusty, but trails of [[salt]] covered some stones, deposited by natural processes over the ages.\n\nOne particular room, used to hold enchanted objects, was lit only by a red radiance."
        },
        "Defenses": "Beyond the small town outside, there was a moat with a drawbridge and stone pillars within the ditch, which had once buttressed the walls.\n\nThe bedroom had wards upon the well, which attacked those who descended. There was an [[illusion]] that would trigger when people approached the rune circles and throne, but it was only bluster and threats by Karsus, who had not added actual wards to the throne room.\n\nOne room was accessible through a stone platform outside the Keep which was engraved with a \"K\". It was enspelled to translocate those who stepped upon it and spoke aloud \"Karsus\". However, the platform did not register as magical to detection. The room could only be left in the same way; there was a floating [[sword]] as its only visible guardian.",
        "History": "The place was originally used by [[Karsus]], who hid a clone in a secluded underground throne room and prepared rune circles describing the casting of several of his most powerful spells, including one to heal all ills,\n\nAt some point, [[Saeraede Lyonora]], an undead [[Netherese]] sorceress, arrived at the Keep, finding Karsus's clone dead.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|644|12}} She also gathered [[gown]]s in a ruined wardrobe from the caravans she exterminated nearby.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|669|13}} She later successfully lured him into the keep.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|693-695|15}}\n\nHowever, the ruins were also located by [[Shar]]ran [[Dreadspell]]s led by [[Elryn]], who were out to slay Elminster; they accidentally revealed the location of the Keep to the [[elf|elven]] mage [[Ilbryn Starym]], who was also seeking to hunt down and slay Elminster;{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|699|17}} he hid himself in the throne room and waited for a chance to ambush the wizard, while the Dreadspells found an entrance into a cache of magical devices, allowing her to nearly strike him down. Azuth appeared then, accompanied by three mages: [[Caladaster Daermree]], [[Tabarast]], and [[Beldrune]]. Azuth warned him that what he was doing was forbidden, and that he was doomed if he didn't break free of her. At that time, the Sharrans revealed themselves, and hurled an onslaught of destructive spells from a gap in the ceiling.\n\nThough Saeraede was able to absorb most of the magic released, the cavern was riven, and the runes holding Karsus' greatest magics were shattered. In turn, Azuth protected the three wizards with him; after the Sharrans decided they'd hurled as many spells as could be useful, they fled, noticing Azuth was still standing. In turn, Saeraede returned herself to life after draining Elminster, only to be immediately struck down by Ilbryn Starym. She then exploded in the already precarious ruins of the keep, leaving the whole chamber open to the elements; Azuth disappeared with Elminster, leaving the place to the three mages that had accompanied him. These three mages, after a short talk, discovered Saeraede's gowns, which they took with themselves."
