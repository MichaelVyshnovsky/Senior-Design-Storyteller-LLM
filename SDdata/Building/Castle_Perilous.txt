'''Castle Perilous''', also called the '''Citadel of the Witch-King''', was the most significant fortification in [[Vaasa]] and the one-time seat of power for the [[lich]] [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King of Vaasa, for his attacks on [[Damara]].

==Description==
It was a fortress of dark stone and bound in [[iron]].

Prior to its destruction, Castle Perilous was a tall and narrow tower that rose high above the wasteland and could be seen for miles. and then soared into the air, supporting two wide parapets on its way up and ending in an onion dome. Four smaller spiked-roof towers were supported in midair by flying buttresses on which were treacherous open-air staircases connecting them to the main citadel.

[[File:CastlePerilous_3e.png|thumb|right|200px|The ruins of Castle Perilous ''circa'' 1372 DR.]]After its destruction, the castle was little more than its bones and foundations standing amidst a pile of rubble. There was an extensive dungeon complex beneath the castle which remained a site of great danger long after the upper sections of the castle had crumbled.

After the castle was said to have rejuvenated in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the walls of the main structure were sleek and black, and were inscribed with runes that absorbed light{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|8-9}} There were no obvious means of gaining entry to the castle proper, and the lower dungeons were rumored to once again be teeming with horrors.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}

==Geography==
Castle Perilous was located on a rocky crag in the tundra of north-central Vaasa{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} which was frozen beneath the [[Great Glacier]] at the time. The castle's immediate area was an utterly lifeless wasteland of crumbling dirt that was carved by steep and jagged miles-long ravines as deep as 100 feet (30.5 meters).

Prior to the castle's destruction, the surrounding region for several miles was contaminated by [[Abyss|Abyssal]] energy seeping out of the portal in the dungeon beneath the castle. The area felt permanently on the verge of a huge rainstorm, with dark clouds overhead and heavy humidity in the air, but the land itself was devoid of any grass or water whatsoever

==History==
[[File:CastlePerilous_ThroneOfBloodstone.png|thumb|left|245px|A rendering of Castle Perilous just before its destruction which shows its distinctive onion dome.]]On a single night in the {{YearlinkName|1347}},The [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign sets for both the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|1st edition]] (set [[1357 DR]]) and [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition|2nd edition]] (set [[1368 DR]]) give Zhengyi and the castle's appearance as happening "20 years ago." The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3rd edition]] onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and set the year as [[1347 DR]]. the fortress called Castle Perilous was raised by Zhengyi with the aid of [[demons]]. Zhengyi then declared himself "the Witch-King," and gathered an army of [[giant]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[orc]]s, [[undead]], and [[assassins]] to use in a conquest of Vaasa and Damara.

The castle served as Zhengyi's personal headquarters, although as a [[lich]] he needed few amenities and mostly just sat in his imposing throne room. The castle's primary purpose was to guard the Abyssal gate in the subbasement, so it was full of traps and monsters acting as guards, mostly in the forms of undead, demons, and [[elemental]]s. Defense of the castle's exterior was handled by the ancient [[white dragon]] [[Arctigis]],> and by Zhengyi himself.

The castle collapsed into ruins when [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party of adventurers defeated Zhengyi in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}.

Thereafter, Castle Perilous was a crumbling ruin, filled with lurking monsters, including giants, goblins, and [[bugbear]]s, and frequented by adventurers looking for remnants of Zhengyi's magic.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|55}} During the 1370s DR, it appeared that the dragons were frequently being driven off or slain by either the adventurers or the even-worse monsters of Castle Perilous. where [[dragonspawn]] were being created.

In the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, an earthquake struck the region and the castle shed its crumbling exterior to reveal seemingly new sleek black stone underneath, inscribed with runes that absorbed light. Some [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa worried Zhengyi's demons had rebuilt the castle overnight. Vaasa's ruling [[Ironfell Council]] was concerned by the events and sent investigators, but none could pierce the defensive runes on the castle's exterior. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} their sages were pouring over ancient texts to learn more about the Castle. Efforts to bypass the wards were being spearheaded by a [[Luminary]] supported by a [[Warlock Knights#Ranks|Knight-Vindicator]], although they had accomplished little save for sending a large number of "test subjects" to fiery deaths attempting to bypass the castle's wards. 

At that same time, the self-styled heir to the Witch-King, [[Mansard Kanaoth]], began amassing troops in secret near the castle, hoping to conquer Vaasa but likewise having no luck deciphering the castle's wards. As of the [[1480 DR|next year]], chromatic dragons were once again being drawn inexplicably to the ruins, although they too were unable to bypass its magical defenses.

Unbeknownst to the Warlock Knights or the world at large, Castle Perilous's dark interior had come to be occupied by [[tanarukk]]s in the service of Orcus, who had entered from the same ''portal'' to the Abyss that had been believed to have been closed when Gareth Dragonsbane slew Zhengyi.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|17}} In fact, it had been the reactivation of this ''portal'' that had brought about the castle's renewal, and both events had occurred as the powers of the Abyss stirred in anticipation the outbreak of the [[Abyssal Plague]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|31}} 

As of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the cause of Castle Perilous's rejuvenation continued to remain a widespread mystery.
