        "mainbody": "The Temple of Prometheus was a temple dedicated to the Olympian god Prometheus in the city of Medinat Muskawoon.\nThe temple was due east of the Great Hall of the Pasha in Medinat Muskawoon. It faced west and slightly south, with its back towards the rising sun in remembrance of the griffon-vulture that would devour Prometheuss liver each morning.\nThe temple was just twenty columns on a raised platform, holding up the roof  above the platform. There was only one wall, facing east, with a  diameter window, and a brazier before it.\nThere were several temples to Prometheus in the fertile valley of the river Athis, brought by the travelers from other realms far removed from Realmspace.\nTorches lit from this shrine had the power to drive away the conjured asps in the Temple of Ra. If lit by the suns rays concentrated by the round window behind it, these torches would not stop burning for as long as they remained in Medinat Muskawoon."
