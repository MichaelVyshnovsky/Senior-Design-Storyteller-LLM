'''Castle Daggerdale''' was a keep that once belonged to the [[Morn]] family for several centuries before being abandoned by the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid    = 3684| postid     = | whichpage  = 43| date       = 2013-06-07| accessdate = 2013-07-28}}<ref> and rebuilt in the early 15{{th}} century DR.

==Location==
Castle Daggerdale was built on the edge of the [[Dagger Hills]], near the headwaters of [[River Ashaba]], across a tributary east from the [[Tethyamar Trail]].{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|64}}

==History==
Castle Daggerdale belonged to [[Randal Morn]]'s family, the leader of anti-[[Zhentarim]] resistance in [[DaggerdaleÂ’]]. The castle was left undamaged but gutted by fires and abandoned, however, Randal Morn's people often used the old castle as a camp, using its old tunnels and basements to escape the Zhents.

In the early 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Daggerdale fell under the rule of [[Barathal Cormaeril]], Randal Morn's great-grandnephew.{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|62}} In the {{YearlinkName|1407}}, Castle Daggerdale was rebuilt by [[Domavos Cormaeril]], Barathal's father, using the [[Cormaeril]] family's money to further accentuate their rulership of the land. In the {{YearlinkName|1475}}, [[Neranya Cormaeril]], Barathal's sister, was presumed killed outside Castle Daggerdale. Her posse was slaughtered by [[lycanthrope]] that recently started plaguing Daggerdale. Neranya's body was never found. By the {{YearlinkName|1480}}{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|65}} Daggerdale became dangerously infested with lycanthropes, leading to Barathal Cormaeril becoming besieged by the children of the black blood and subsequent control of the region beginning to deteriorate.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some local rumors told stories of the Morn family treasures hidden behind bricked-up tunnels in the castle's basements.
