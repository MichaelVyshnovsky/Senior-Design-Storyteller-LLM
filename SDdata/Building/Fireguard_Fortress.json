After the eruption of the mountain, portions of its power chambers were completely overtaken by the magma flow and entirely inaccessible by most beings.\nSet within the mountain itself, Fireguard Fortress combined dwarven stone architecture and impressive metalwork. Not only did the fortress itself weather both the intense heat and harsh volcanic environment, but it featured prodigious use of mechanical engineering. Navigation throughout the fortress in part utilized mechanical levers that raised or lowered large stone platforms that allowed entrance onto certain passageways.\nWhile the original purpose and specifications of the dwarven fortress were lost to the ages, it served as a military stronghold as of the late 15 century DR.\nFireguard Fortress dated back to the ancient dwarven kingdom of Delzoun that flourished during the Age of the Proud People. After Delzouns fall, the fortress remained lost and untouched for many years until Mount Hotenow erupted in the .\nThe discovery of lost dwarfholds within Mount Hotenow spurred the dwarves Clan Hillborn to lead an expedition into the volcanic mountain and recover some of their lost heritage.

The fire archon general Ignazar was granted dominion over Fireguard Fortress, using the ancient stronghold to house and train his legion of elemental soldiers.\nFortunately for the displaced Hillborn dwarves, which had since found a new home in the city of Neverwinter, the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge was enlisted by Sergeant Knox of the Neverwinter Guard. The hero ventured from the city to the dwarven camp at Mount Hotenow, and helped them drive Gommoth and his cultists out from their numerous strongholds so they could take back the ancestral home of their clan."
