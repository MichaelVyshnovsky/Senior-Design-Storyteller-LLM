}}'''The Ram and Duck''' was a rough inn in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]].

==Structure==
===Interior===
It had exposed timbers. Most of its furniture was old enough to have been broken and repaired several times. A line of pegs held up the inn's [[mug]]s, but none of them matched one another. The wooden floorboards were loose. The inn's shutters were wooden slats set with the bottoms of broken bottles.
