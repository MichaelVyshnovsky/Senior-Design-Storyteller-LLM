'''Fort Tufenk''' was a garrison fort located in southern [[Tethyr]]. It was also known as the '''Fortress of Fire'''.

==Location==
Fort Tufenk was one of the four major forts located in [[Calimmon|County Calimmon]] in [[Ankaram|Duchy Ankaram]], guarding the border with [[Calimshan]], along the [[River Agis]]. It sat upon a ridge overlooking an old trail toward [[Shoonach]].

==Structure==
The fort was a stone-walled enclosure set atop a small hill and surrounded by deep trenches, about ten to fifteen feet (three to five meters) deep. The walls were also between ten and fifteen feet thick and stood twenty feet (six meters) high.

==History==
As of [[1370 DR]], the fort was over 600 years old. The legend was that the ridge upon which the fort was built was constructed by [[jann]] during the [[First Era of Skyfire]] to serve as a defense against [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon's]] [[Army of Fire]].

According to some historians, Fort Tufenk was the site where future king and queen [[Haedrak Rhindaun III|Haedrak III]] and [[Zaranda Star|Zaranda I]] slew [[Yusuf Jhannivvar]] after the [[Storm Siege]] of [[Myratma]]. (Other sources claimed that he was killed upon the ruined western walls of the city.)

The [[Janessar]], an organization of warriors and [[priest]]s who were opposed to slavery in [[Calimshan]], had ties with the leaders of Fort Tufenk.

==Inhabitants==
The fort had a single commander who oversaw ten to fifteen junior officers. Between 200 and 300 soldiers were stationed there.
