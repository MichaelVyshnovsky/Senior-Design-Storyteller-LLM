'''South Spire''' was the mage tower of [[Thessamel Arunder]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, [[Thessamel Arunder]]'s apprentice, [[Faeya]], signed off on the sale of his tower to a cabal of merchants in exchange for 200,000 [[gp]], a promise to remain unmolested, free firewood, and a dozen [[deer]] a year. Thessamel was initially outraged, until Faeya reminded him that the [[wild magic]] spreading throughout [[Faerûn]] at the time was now public knowledge, and that she'd had to stab two old rivals of his to death. Thessamel also learned that [[Barundryn Harbright]], a warrior he'd met at a feast in [[Felmorel]], was now his tenant.
