South Spire was the mage tower of Thessamel Arunder.
In the , Thessamel Arunders apprentice, Faeya, signed off on the sale of his tower to a cabal of merchants in exchange for 200,000 gp, a promise to remain unmolested, free firewood, and a dozen deer a year. Thessamel was initially outraged, until Faeya reminded him that the wild magic spreading throughout Faer√ªn at the time was now public knowledge, and that shed had to stab two old rivals of his to death. Thessamel also learned that Barundryn Harbright, a warrior hed met at a feast in Felmorel, was now his tenant.
