The '''Livestock Pen''' was a cruelly-named slave pen in [[Melvaunt]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Location==
The Livestock Pen was located near the center of Melvaunt.

==Defenses==
A dozen men-at-arms were present to ensure both the slave merchants and their live property were protected and to keep them from escaping. The guard was doubled after a large shipment of slaves escaped.
