The Livestock Pen was a cruelly-named slave pen in Melvaunt around 1367 DR.
The Livestock Pen was located near the center of Melvaunt.
A dozen men-at-arms were present to ensure both the slave merchants and their live property were protected and to keep them from escaping. The guard was doubled after a large shipment of slaves escaped.
