The Throat was a water tower in Luskan.
The tower was located in the North Bank of Luskan near the Red Dragon Trading Post.
The Throat was a large water tower surrounded by pastures for tending sheep.
Anyone found in the vicinity of the tower was immediately apprehended to protect the citys main water supply. The city guards were armed with crossbows with paralyzing quarrels.
Around 1370 DR, the sheep raised in the field around the Throat were given to the five captains of Luskan Baram, Kurth, Rethnor, Suljack, and Taerl. For a time, dwarves made it a rite of passage to paint the High Captains sheep different colors, but after a bloody feud with the city, the practice ceased.
Most Luskanites would tell all travelers to Luskan that the Throat and Whitesails Harbor were extremely dangerous places filled with kidnappers and killers.
