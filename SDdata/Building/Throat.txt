The '''Throat''' was a water tower in [[Luskan]].

==Location==
The tower was located in the [[North Bank of Luskan]] near the [[Red Dragon Trading Post]].

==Structure==
The Throat was a large water tower surrounded by pastures for tending sheep.

==Inhabitants==
Anyone found in the vicinity of the tower was immediately apprehended to protect the city's main water supply. The city guards were armed with [[crossbow]]s with paralyzing quarrels.

==History==
Around [[1370 DR]], the sheep raised in the field around the Throat were given to the five captains of Luskan: [[Baram]], [[Kurth]], [[Rethnor]], [[Suljack]], and [[Taerl]]. For a time, [[dwarf|dwarves]] made it a rite of passage to paint the High Captains' sheep different colors, but after a bloody feud with the city, the practice ceased.

==Rumors and Legends==
Most Luskanites would tell all travelers to Luskan that the Throat and [[Whitesails Harbor]] were extremely dangerous places filled with kidnappers and killers.
