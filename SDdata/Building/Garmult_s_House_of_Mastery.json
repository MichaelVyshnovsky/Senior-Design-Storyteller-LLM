Additionally it served as a social club for the members of the Bannerless Legion crew.\nGarmult offered martial combat training to many Baldurian men-at-arms who could afford the fees. Many prospective warriors could find a willing sparring partner within.\nAdditionally, Garmult used the school to scout for prospective members of the Bannerless Legion. They worked with Dezri Lamouer to find skilled individuals who could work as mercenaries for their clientele."
