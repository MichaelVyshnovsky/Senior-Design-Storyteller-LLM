'''Sparandar Gate''' was the southernmost gate into the city of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==Location==
Athkatla's [[Athkatla/Grave District|Grave District]] was the southernmost part of Athkatla, walled from the main city and separated from it by the [[Cold Dolor Gate]]. Sparandar Gate, in turn, was the only entrance into the Grave District from outside of Athkatla.

==Activities==
All non-citizens who passed Cold Dolor Gate had to pay an "any one coin" toll, of [[gold]] or [[silver]], to be allowed into the main body of Athkatla, however, passage through Sparandar Gate was unrestricted by such means, allowing guests access to the city cemetery.
