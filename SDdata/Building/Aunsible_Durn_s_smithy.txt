The '''smithy''' in the town of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] was run by the skilled smith [[Aunsible Durn]]. It had no name, for there was no other in town.

==Location==
The smithy stood in the eastern part of town.

==Structure==
The business comprised both a smithy and a stables. It was signposted by a burning coal hanging from a curved rod by the entrance. This was actually a bumpy, red glass globe lit with a ''[[continual light]]'' that regularly dimmed and brightened without going dark; this spell had apparently been placed by an itinerant mage, and Jasper suspected for the cheapest price.

The building had three floors. The ground floor held the main shop, the second floor were lofts used for storage of supplies, and the third floor was a small apartment wherein Durn lived.

==Interior==
It had all the usual smith's tools, such as an [[anvil]].

==Services==
At the smithy, Durn forged agricultural tools like [[horseshoe]]s, [[plowshare]]s, and [[scythe]]s, and even various [[polearm]]s. People traveled for miles to purchase his wares, or at the least the tools. Local farmers with a bit of wealth to spare liked to outfit their workers with [[polearm|bill]]s, [[halberd]]s, and [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s from Aunsible Durn. Hence he did good business and good work. The nearest competition was in [[Hultail]].

==Inhabitants==
The smithy was owned and run by Aunsible Durn, who also lived on the premises.

He was assisted in his work by [[Dovo]].

==History==
Durn came to Ghars and set up his smithy there shortly after the [[Purple Dragons]] garrison did. Their presence and services such as the smithy helped the village grow into a town. It was well established by the mid-1360s DR.

In the first several days of his employment at the smithy, Dovo put a burr under his friend [[Argys Kral]]'s [[saddle]] so it threw him when he mounted. Durn chewed Dovo out for that and he carried out no more of his pranks, at least at the smithy.

In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the king's envoy [[Grodoveth]] went to the smithy to get his horse re-shoed. Dovo annoyed him with questions and Grodoveth hit him for being too rough with his [[horse]]. A few days later, on [[Eleint 16]], Dovo was found dead and Durn was left with a heavy workload to do alone. In the evening, [[Jasper (servant)|Jasper]] went to the smithy to speak with Durn as part of his investigation. Over [[tea]] in the apartment above, Durn related what kind of man Dovo was and his recent history.
