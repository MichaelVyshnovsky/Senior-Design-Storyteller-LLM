Huntingdown Hall was the residence of Lord Huntingdown in the late 15 century DR.
Huntingdown Hall was in Suzail.
At some point after the massacre of the Council of the Dragon in late Mirtul of the , the renegade wizard Elminster Aumar laid down alarm spells around Suzail to warn him if any blueflame ghosts became active around the city. His spells told him Lord Huntingdown was attacked by a Blueflame ghost in his residence at Huntingdown Hall at some point.
