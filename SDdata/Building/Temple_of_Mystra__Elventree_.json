        "mainbody": "The Temple of Mystra in Elventree was a hollow cairn that held great mysterious power.\nThe interior of the cairn was pitch black and shimmered with energy that represented every form of arcane magic known on Faerûn. Because of this energy, spells cast within the cairn were cast at their maximum effect.\nAll practitioners of magic, including those with dark hearts, were welcome to use the cairn to develop their spells. Evil-doers were watched closely by the mysterious overseer of the temple around 1367 DR—a man known simply as the Sentinel who appeared to have the ability to know their intentions."
