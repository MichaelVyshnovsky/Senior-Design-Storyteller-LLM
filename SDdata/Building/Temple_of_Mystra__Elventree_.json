        "Description": "The interior of the cairn was pitch black and shimmered with energy that represented every form of [[arcane magic]] known on [[Faerûn]]. Because of this energy, spells cast within the cairn were cast at their maximum effect.",
        "Inhabitants": "All practitioners of [[magic]], including those with dark hearts, were welcome to use the cairn to develop their spells. Evil-doers were watched closely by the mysterious overseer of the temple around [[1367 DR]]—a man known simply as the [[The Sentinel (Elventree)|Sentinel]] who appeared to have the ability to know their intentions."
