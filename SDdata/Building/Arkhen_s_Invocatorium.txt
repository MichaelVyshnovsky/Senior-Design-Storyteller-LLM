'''Arkhen's Invocatorium'''<ref group="note">''Volo's Guide to the North'' and ''The Savage Frontier'' both use the spelling "Arken's Invocatorium". Since ''Silver Marches'' is a more recent publication, the spelling therein of "Arkhen's" takes precedence. was a college of [[magic]] in [[Silverymoon]] that specialized in [[sorcerer|sorcery]]. The school was run by [[Arkhen|Arkhen the Icy]], and was part of the [[Conclave of Silverymoon]]. The Invocatorium was once situated in a stone fortress on the east side of Silverymoon, but later moved into an entirely new building, filled with animated [[construct]]s.
