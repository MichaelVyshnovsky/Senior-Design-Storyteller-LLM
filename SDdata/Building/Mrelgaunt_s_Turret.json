        "mainbody": "'''Mrelgaunt's Turret''' was a haunted [[wizard]]'s tower falling into ruin near [[Everlund]] by the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite dragon/284/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Mrelgaunt's Turret|74}}",
        "Location": "This structure was located in the foothills of the [[Nether Mountains]] northeast of Everlund, in a ravine cut by a nameless stream that eventually fed into the [[River Rauvin]]. The tower was built near the bottom of the ravine in the middle of the stream (or the stream eventually surrounded the tower) and was difficult to spot among the tall trees and rugged terrain.",
        "Structure": "The cylindrical stone tower was approximately four stories tall and capped by a steeply tapered cone roof that was covered with shingles made of slate. A flagpole was mounted on the peak of the roof, but no flag had flown there for many years. A closed trapdoor and handrails were visible near the base of the flagpole. The most striking feature of the tower was the missing ground floor&mdash;it had collapsed, walls and all, sometime in the Turret's history, while the remaining structure was held aloft by nothing more than magical enchantments. Possible entrances to the Turret were the broken staircase leading up to the former second floor, or the trap door in the roof.{{Cite dragon/284/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Mrelgaunt's Turret|76}}\n\n[[File:MrelgauntTurret-base.png|right|thumb|250px|The whirlpool below and the tower above.]]",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Turret was dark from the outside, with few or no windows. Birds did not enter the structure nor perch or nest on its roof. Those who visited the topmost room with non-threatening intent found that the whispering voice was lonely and eager to talk about [[spell]]craft, give advice, identify items, or hear news of research into [[the Art]]."
        },
        "Defenses": "The physical defense of hovering over running water was enough to keep wandering creatures away, but did not present a great obstacle to determined adventurers. The helmed horror on the second floor would attack anyone who attempted to vandalize the Turret or its furnishings and decorations. A second helmed horror appeared whenever a tool was removed from the chamber with the preserved tapestries, intent on retrieving the tool and putting it back in its proper place.\n[[File:MrelgauntTurret-Stump.png|right|thumb|250px|A hollow stump filled with bones.]]\n\nThe most potent defense of the Turret was Mrelgaunt himself. He was a high-ranking wizard who retained all his spellcasting abilities when he crossed into [[undeath]]. In addition, he had some of the abilities of a ghost: the power to pass through walls and floors and move in complete silence, a damaging touch, the ability to manifest, ''etc.'' He was aware of intruders throughout his tower and for some distance into the surrounding countryside. A hollow tree stump not far from the Turret contained a pile of human bones that Mrelgaunt could use for casting his ''[[whirlwind of bones]]'' spell.{{Cite dragon/284/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Mrelgaunt's Turret|75}}",
        "History": "The Turret was built for Mrelgaunt by a company of [[dwarves]]&mdash;the lead stonecutter was [[Haelburt Downdelve]]&mdash;sometime in the early decades of the [[:Category:12th century|12{{th}} century]] [[DR]], and Mrelgaunt became a haunting spirit approximately fifty years later. In the late [[:Category:13th century|13{{th}} century]], what was then the first floor (including the walls) collapsed, leaving the rest of the tower hovering by its enchantments over the jagged teeth of the broken cellar wall and the lazy whirlpool that filled the basement chambers."
