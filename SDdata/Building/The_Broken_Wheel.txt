The Broken Wheel was one of the few serviceable inns found in the city of Kadarasto in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The Broken Wheel was named for a carving of a cracked wheel found on the floor in the common room.
This lavish inn was found in the southern part of the city.
The inn was owned and operated by Mauza Dalidasis in 1367 DR.
The wheel carving adorning the floor of the common area was in fact an asfr used by the ancient Geomancers.
