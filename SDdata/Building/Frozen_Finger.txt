The '''Frozen Finger''' was the only [[inn]] in the village of [[Ishe]] in [[Vaasa]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
The inn was dilapidated, with walls so rotted that they barely kept out the cold or the wind.

==Interior==
The atmosphere was dismal, and the inn catered to the rough and delinquent crowd who made their livelihoods as trappers in and around Ishe. It was also a meeting place for [[adventurer]]s and explorers heading north into the [[Great Glacier]].

==Services==
The lodgings were comfortable and affordable, although the [[ale]] was said to taste like mud.

The Frozen Finger was not merely an inn, but acted as a trading post where furs and pelts could be sold or exchanged for goods. It was the only place in Ishe where one could reliably purchase all of the clothing and equipment needed for traversing into the Great Glacier, although this equipment could be overpriced. A full set of winter gear (including parkas, [[gloves]], [[boots]], trousers, and underwear) cost 75 [[gold piece]]s. Also available for sale were [[sleeping bag]]s, [[fishing rod]]s, [[snow goggles]], and [[face razor]]s.

The inn also provided storage services for explorers to leave behind baggage that would slow them down in the arctic environs further north.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the Frozen Finger's many services were managed by a shrewd but fair [[human]] man named [[Vurl]]. One of his close associates and permanent lodgers was [[Kahil Brogman]], a local trapper who masqueraded as an expert guide.
