The '''Wizard of Wines''' was a vineyard and winery in the valley of [[Barovia]], and home of the [[Martikov]] family. It produced and distributed [[wine]] to all settlements of the valley, as well as [[Castle Ravenloft]].

==Location==
The winery was located in the western edge of the valley, south of the village of [[Krezk]] and north of [[Yester Hill]]. It was surrounded by the [[Svalich Woods]] and connected to the [[Old Svalich Road]] via a muddy trail.

==Services==
The winery distributed wine for free to all settlements of Barovia. It was known for three vintages:
;[[Purple Grapemash No. 3]]:
: An unremarkable table wine.
;[[Red Dragon Crush]]:
: A flavorsome vintage, which was sold at inns for 1 [[sp]] per {{SI|1|pt|l|long=yes}}.
;[[Champagne du le Stomp]]:
: A rich sparkling wine.

==History==
The winery was originally given by [[Strahd von Zarovich]] to the [[Krezkov]] family as a reward for their loyalty, but it later passed on to the Martikov family through marriage.

Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the winery was visited by the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] during their imprisonment in Barovia.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3}} Having been brought there by [[Adrian Martikov]] after the Heroes saved him from an ambush in the Svalich Woods,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}} they were met with suspicion by [[Davian Martikov]], Adrian's father. Davian reluctantly agreed to allow the adventurers to spend two nights in the winery's stable. During the first night, [[Delina]] and [[Krydle]] experienced hallucinations created by the [[Dark Powers]] and were almost driven to kill each other, were it not for the intervention of [[Shandie Freefoot]]. The following morning, they decided to leave the winery and continue their journey to [[Vallaki]].

==Inhabitants==
The winery was run by Davian and operated by his sons Adrian and [[Elvir Martikov|Elvir]] and by his daughter [[Stefania Martikov|Stefania]] and her husband [[Dag Tomescu]].
