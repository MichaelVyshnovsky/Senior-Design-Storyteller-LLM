'''Fort Agis''', also known as '''Memnonnar Citadel''', was one of the border keeps of [[Tethyr]], collectively known as the [[Calimmon]] Garrisons.

==Location==
This fort was located two miles north of [[Memnon]] on the edge of the ruins of [[Memnonnar]].

==Structure==
Like most of the Calimmon Garrisons, this non-elaborate fortress was built from huge stones. Its walls were ten-to-fifteen-feet thick (3.0â€“4.6 meters) and 20 feet high (6.1 meters) with a deep, empty moat around them.

==Defenses==
Due to its proximity to one of [[Calimshan]]'s major cities and one of its most dangerous ruins, Fort Agis was defended with a greater complement of troops than its sister garrisons. Around 300 Tethyrian soldiers were stationed there. 

==History==
As of [[1370 DR]], the fort was approximately 600 years old.<ref>

* Fort Agis
* [[Fort Tufenk]]
* the [[Iltakar Garrison]]
* [[Fort Calim]]
