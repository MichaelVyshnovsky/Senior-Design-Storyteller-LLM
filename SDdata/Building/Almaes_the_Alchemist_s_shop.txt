Almaes the Alchemists Shop was the shop of the gnomish alchemist Almaestaddamir Auldcastle found in Ashabenford, Mistledale, in the late 1300s DR. Within his lab, he produced and sold a variety of alchemical reagents and completed mixtures. Among these were smokepowder, tanglefoot bags, sunrods, and various acids and anti-toxins.
On one occasion, Almaestaddamir made an offer to High Councilor Haresk Malorn to build a machine capable of flinging kegs of smokepowder at drow raiders in order to better defend the dale. The latter politely declined the proposal.
