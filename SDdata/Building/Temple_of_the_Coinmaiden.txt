The Temple of the Coinmaiden was a place dedicated to the worship of Waukeen in the town of Phandalin. It was founded in the .
The temple was located on the north side of Phandalin, and was thus one of the first buildings that would be seen when entering the town from the Triboar Trail.
The temple itself was a former general store and trading post called Barthens Provisions. It was adorned and decorated lavishly, as befitting a house of worship of the goddess of wealth.
The acolytes of the temple, Hesten Jenz and Mischka Solmen, preached and held services, and handled most other public-facing roles. Meanwhile, the highest-ranking member, Ditch Fundi, preferred to simply focus on the temples finances.
About half-a-year after Barthens Provisions went out of business in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR, the building was purchased by an unnamed buyer who donated it to the Church of Waukeen. Within a month, the building was renovated and dedicated as a temple under the supervision of gnomish priestess Ditch Fundi.
In truth, the dedication of the building as a temple was simply a ruse to plant Ditch in Phandalin as a spy for a cabal known as The Six. Even the acolytes of the temple had no idea that she was not a real cleric of Waukeen.
