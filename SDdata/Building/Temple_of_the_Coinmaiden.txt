The '''Temple of the Coinmaiden''' was a place dedicated to the worship of [[Waukeen]] in the town of [[Phandalin]]. It was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1496}}.{{AI-time}}

==Location==
The temple was located on the north side of Phandalin, and was thus one of the first buildings that would be seen when entering the town from the [[Triboar Trail]].

==Structure==
The temple itself was a former general store and trading post called [[Barthen's Provisions]]. It was adorned and decorated lavishly, as befitting a house of worship of the goddess of wealth.

==Services==
The acolytes of the temple, [[Hesten Jenz]] and [[Mischka Solmen]], preached and held services, and handled most other public-facing roles. Meanwhile, the highest-ranking member, [[Ditch Fundi]], preferred to simply focus on the temple's finances.

==History==
About half-a-year after Barthen's Provisions went out of business in late [[1495 DR]] or early [[1496 DR]], the building was purchased by an unnamed buyer who donated it to the [[Church of Waukeen]]. Within a month, the building was renovated and dedicated as a temple under the supervision of [[gnome|gnomish]] priestess [[Ditch Fundi]].

In truth, the dedication of the building as a temple was simply a ruse to plant Ditch in Phandalin as a spy for a cabal known as [[The Six]]. Even the acolytes of the temple had no idea that she was not a real [[cleric]] of Waukeen.
