        "Activities": "Since the wealth of the [[Grand Caliph]] was stored here, it was heavily guarded. In addition to gold [[dinar]]s, the treasury housed priceless works of art, valuable gems, and other relics.",
        "Defenses": "Twenty [[mamluk]] guards circled the Hall of the Treasury at all times. A pair of [[noble dao]] were stationed within the actual vault. Priests of [[Jisan]] were on hand to monitor and dispense funds from the treasury.\n\nMagical traps abounded within the Hall of the Treasury. The exact location and nature of these traps was only known by the Grand Vizier, [[Alyana al-Azzazi]], and the Keeper of the Treasury, [[Ala'i ibn-Hasim]]."
