The '''Charcoal Palace''' was a massive structure located in the [[City of Brass]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

The Palace was found within [[Furnace (district)|the Furnace ward]] of the city.

==Description==
Dark [[basalt]] was used to construct most of the structure of the palace. The basalt was so dark that it appeared to drain light from the flames surrounding the city. [[Gold]], [[brass]], and [[copper]] were used to cover many of the towers and domes of the palace.

The Charcoal Palace was perched atop a landrise overlooking the entire city. A huge fountain of purple fire, called the [[Breath of the Sultan]], was found before the palace as the sign of the Sultan's constant rule and vigilance.

==Activities==
The Charcoal Palace served as the seat of power for the Great Sultan of the [[Efreet]], [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan]] and his court of [[efreeti tyrants]].
