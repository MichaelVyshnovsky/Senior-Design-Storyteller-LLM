The '''Sailor's Last Request''' was a small chapel to [[Valkur]] located in [[Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located in front on the docks, in an old and small warehouse building nested on the corner of [[Dock Street (Waterdeep)|Dock Street]] and [[Odd Street]]. 

===Atmosphere===
The small chapel was long since missing a front door, and served as a refuge to impoverished [[:category:sailors|sailors]], [[dove]] and [[seagull]]s. The floor was full of bird droppings, and the whole place smelt of [[fish]] and brine. 

The place didn't have dedicated [[Church of Valkur|clergy members]] watching over it&mdash;just an old retired sailor named [[Olroy]] acting as its guard. The altar was an old broken-down table in a corner, full of offerings left over time by worshipers such as seashells, locks of hair, and mementos of strong sentimental value.

The temple to Valkur was often a loud and busy place, used by seafarers as a place to socialize and find new crew members. The deity didn't mind as it valued strength and actions over prayers.

==History==
Before being a temple, the place was a small warehouse used to store salted fish.
