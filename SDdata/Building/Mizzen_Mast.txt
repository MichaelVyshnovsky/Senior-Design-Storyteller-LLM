The Mizzen Mast was a business in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
The Mizzen Mast was a three-story building in good condition.
The Mizzen Mast specialized in the construction of a wide range of watercraft, guided by the motto, “No boat too large or small.” Owned and operated by Zulthir "Spyglass" Hestern, a seasoned craftsman with decades of experience, the Mizzen Mast constructed everything from simple rafts to grand galleons. Known for delivering quality results at reasonable prices, Zulthirs work was particularly favored by smugglers, who valued his expertise in crafting hidden compartments within vessels, ideal for concealing illicit cargo.
