The '''Great Keep''' was a defensible inner fortification of [[Krak al-Niraan]] within the [[Weeping Desert]] of [[Zakhara]].

==Defenses==
The only entrance to the tower could be blocked off during a siege, isolating the structure from the rest of the castle.

==Structure==
The Great Keep had its own armory, water supply, and food stores. The first floor was dedicated to sleeping quarters for the [[shig'harakhi]]. The second floor contained a lavish study and library where [[Elemental mage|flame mages]] researched their [[spell]]s. The entire third floor was an armory filled with weapons for the fanatics. The top floor of the Great Keep was an astronomical observatory complete with star charts and a telescope enchanted with [[true seeing]].
