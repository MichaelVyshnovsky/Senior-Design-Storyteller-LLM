This temple provided temporary housing to individuals of most [[good]] and [[neutral]] faiths in return for a nightly fee.

==Inhabitants==
Patriarch [[Charisbonde Trueservant]] was the High Priest of the temple. His congregation consisted of 28 other priests and 170 followers. [[Jelde Asturien]] acted as the temple's secular liaison.

==History==
[[File:House of the Morning ruins.jpg|300px|thumb|''The sun sets on the House of the Morning after it was razed.'']]
During the mid-1480s [[DR]], the [[drow]] of [[Sschindylryn]] launched a [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar|sudden attack]] on the town of Eveningstar. Much of the western part of town was burned and lost in the fighting, including the House of the Morning, then a temple of [[Amaunator]]. The temple was almost completely destroyed, leaving the local [[Amaunatori]] shocked and dismayed, including [[Feith Lightsong]], [[Azerie Germond]], and [[Wilkan Drome]].
