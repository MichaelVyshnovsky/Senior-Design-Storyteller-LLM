        "mainbody": "The '''Wink and Kiss''' was a decent tavern in [[Arabel]].",
        "Location": "The tavern was found on the outermost street of Arabel, just inside of the city walls. It was a short distance east of the southern [[Calantar's Gate]] and [[Calantar's Way]], which led to [[Immersea]] and [[Suzail]],{{Cite interactive atlas|Kings Forest}}{{Cite interactive atlas|3360 Arabel}}{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|32,33}} and a block west down the same street from the [[Nine Fires]] inn.",
        "Services": "The Wink and Kiss was known around Arabel as a place to get good meals and gossip.",
        "History": "During [[Gondegal]]'s war in [[1352 DR]], the Cormyrean counter-attack was to be conducted by magically blasting the wall apart. Baron [[Thomdor Ammaeth]] sadly noted that the Wink and Kiss would likely be destroyed in the process, but before the assault could commence Gondegal vanished and his army collapsed.\n\nThe tavern suffered a mysterious fire in [[1365 DR]] during the [[Night of Masks]] festival, burning at least partially down.\n\nThe [[Puppetmasters]] gang of [[adventurer]]s used the Wink and Kiss as their home base while working on schemes in [[1369 DR]]."
