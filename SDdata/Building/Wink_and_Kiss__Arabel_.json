        "mainbody": "he Wink and Kiss was a decent tavern in Arabel.\nThe tavern was found on the outermost street of Arabel, just inside of the city walls. It was a short distance east of the southern Calantars Gate and Calantars Way, which led to Immersea and Suzail, and a block west down the same street from the Nine Fires inn.\nThe Wink and Kiss was known around Arabel as a place to get good meals and gossip.\nDuring Gondegals war in 1352 DR, the Cormyrean counter-attack was to be conducted by magically blasting the wall apart. Baron Thomdor Ammaeth sadly noted that the Wink and Kiss would likely be destroyed in the process, but before the assault could commence Gondegal vanished and his army collapsed.\nThe tavern suffered a mysterious fire in 1365 DR during the Night of Masks festival, burning at least partially down.\nThe Puppetmasters gang of adventurers used the Wink and Kiss as their home base while working on schemes in 1369 DR."
