The '''Endshift Tavern''' was a tavern in the [[Field Ward]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century. It was a frequent stop for off-duty members of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]].

==Location==
The tavern was located on the corner of [[Endshift Street]] and the [[Breezeway]].

==History==
Some time in [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} there was an altercation between the innkeeper and a member of the [[Shard Shunners]], a gang of [[halfling]] [[wererat]]s. As retribution, the gang was frequently robbing the tavern and assaulting some of its patrons. As the City Watch did not patrol the Field Ward, the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] may have sent a group of adventurers to investigate the problem.
