The Endshift Tavern was a tavern in the Field Ward in Waterdeep in the late 15 century. It was a frequent stop for off-duty members of the City Guard.
The tavern was located on the corner of Endshift Street and the Breezeway.
Some time in 1492 DR, there was an altercation between the innkeeper and a member of the Shard Shunners, a gang of halfling wererats. As retribution, the gang was frequently robbing the tavern and assaulting some of its patrons. As the City Watch did not patrol the Field Ward, the Order of the Gauntlet may have sent a group of adventurers to investigate the problem.
