The Steps of Istishia was the most impressive structure within the city of Keltar.
This monolithic shrine to the Water Lord was built thousands of years before the 14 century DR. Water from the Calim River was diverted by sluice gate and pumped to the top of the structure by hidden screw pumps. The water was then magically guided down the monolith in four stair-like patterns to reach a pool of water surrounding the Steps. To ensure that this pool of water was always clear and clean, it was magically returned to the river twice a day to be replaced with fresh water.
