The Shrine of Mystra was a small cave located a few hundred feet away from the Polyandrium in Myth Drannor. The shrine was built on one of the magical lines of power and was open for pilgrims who sought Mystras blessing and the goddesss worshipers who needed a moment of quiet contemplation.
The cave was protected by a permanent hallow spell, scaring away the creatures of evil alignment. Once a creature entered the Shrines cave, they felt the magic coursing through, making it almost feel like electricity was hanging in the air.
The cave had a pool of crystal-clear water that filled a third of the cave, along the northern wall. To the east stood a statue of a beautiful woman, Mystra herself. Upon closer examination, it was clear that the statue depicted Mystras form preceding the Time of Troubles. The statue was enchanted to keep the temperature inside the Shrine at a warm spring mornings level. One lonely torch lit with a continual flame spell lit the cave with flickering almost mystical light reflected from the pool of water.

A set of stairs carved out of stone led outside the shrine. The walls around the stairs had glyphs of warding etched onto them protecting the cave from the undead and evil extraplanar beings.
Several patches of blueglow moss grew around the cave close to the pool of water.
From the outside, the entrance to the Shrine of Mystra was a part of a small stone building surrounded by thick forest.
The Shrine of Mystra was constructed during the early days of Myth Drannors renaissance.
In 1369 DR, a group of adventurers followed the slavers of the Cult of the Dragon through a one-way gate from Darnarests tower and emerged inside the Shrine of Mystra.
