The '''Home of the Boars''' was a lodge standing on the edge of the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

It was a haven for members of the [[Harper]]s seeking refuge and help, especially because [[Darathra Shendrel]], Lord Protector of Triboar, was also a Harper.
