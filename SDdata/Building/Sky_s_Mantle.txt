The Skys Mantle was a prestigious tavern in the Stiltways of Yhaunn.
The tavern was located atop the fifth level of the Stiltways, on the southern side of the district.
The Mantle was a quality tavern that catered to the wealthy socialites of Yhaunn. As it was built on the rooftop terraces of the district, patrons could enjoy a cool breeze and clear moonlight, a rarity in the crowded and built-up city. 
Because the Stiltways were considered extremely dangerous at night, the Mantle appealed to those with a sense of daring, even though it was completely safe atop the fifth level.
In 1373 DR, the dissolute duelist Keph Thingoleir repeatedly encountered his rival Lyraene at the Mantle, and they instigated fights with each other.
