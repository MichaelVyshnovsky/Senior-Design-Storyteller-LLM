TheÂ '''Acropolis of Thanatos''' was the largest temple devoted to the worship of the goddess [[Kiaransalee]].

==Location==
The Acropolis of Thanatos was located under the [[Galena Mountains]], northeast of the [[Moondeep Sea]], in the center of [[V'elddrinnsshar]]. It stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls,

==Description==
The temple was a brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat Most of the temple and the cavern itself shone with the light of the ''[[faerzress]]''.

==History==
The [[Crones of Thanatos|Crones]] accumulated a massive amount of [[voidstone]] within the Acropolis in order to sustain a [[gate]] to the [[Negative Energy plane]], hoping to summon an army of undead. ''Circa'' [[1376 DR]], the massive amount of voidstone reacted with the ''faerzress'', augmenting it and causing [[faerie fire]] to appear when [[drow]] [[cleric]]s and [[wizard]]s cast [[divination]] and [[teleportation]] spells. When an expedition of wizards from [[Sshamath]] and priests of [[Eilistraee]] arrived at the temple, a fight ensued. The expedition was defeated, and the chief part of the temple where the sphere of voidstone was kept hovering in the air was reduced to rubble.

When [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] used [[Elven high magic]] to erase [[Kiaransalee]]'s name from everyone's mind, all the Crones either died if they were undead or were left extremely confused and lost.
