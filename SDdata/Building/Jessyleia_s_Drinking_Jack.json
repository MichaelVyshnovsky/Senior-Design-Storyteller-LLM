        "mainbody": "'''Jessyleia's Drinking Jack''', or the '''Jessajack''' as it was referred to by [[Mosstonian]]s, was a sparkling and loud new drinking establishment in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Jessajack's halls were often flooded with loud bellow [[drum]]s and blast-[[horn]]s music. The clientele was just as loud. This tavern was the spot to be seen at, popular among social butterflies and self-important residents of Mosstone. A guest could always see locals loudly discussing their exclusive business deals, posh lives, and alleged interactions with important [[archwizard]]s and kings."
        },
        "Services": "The loud tavern offered a passable [[beer]] selection and scant range of [[wine]]s for purchase, and all were overpriced for the quality offered. The only type of food that was served at the Jessajack were little finger-pastries and tiny decorated cakes.\n\nThe store's proprietor, [[Jessyleia]], was a successful [[silk]]s-dancer from [[Calimshan]] who put her money into her tavern. She was known to occasionally appear on the Jessajack's bar for an impromptu performance.\n\nJessyleia employed a group of female dances that were quite breathtaking in their skill."
