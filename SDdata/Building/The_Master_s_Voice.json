        "mainbody": "The Masters Voice was a tavern that once stood in the town of Y没lash in the Moonsea region, ruined by 1357 DR.\nThe Masters Voice stood at the heart of the ruined Y没lash with an occupying force of the Red Plumes checkpoint to the northwest, stables across the street to the north, and a bakery next door to the east.\nAfter the ruination of Y没lash, The Masters Voice only suggested its previous use through remnants of a bar and copious broken glass and pottery across its taproom. A sign outside read \"The Masters Voice, A Drinking Establishment of Quality.\" In the , an occasional Red Plume mercenary from the nearby checkpoint snuck into the Masters Voice for an unauthorized nap."
