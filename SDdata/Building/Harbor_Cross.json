In particular, Lord Brambleberry's forces got pinned down by [[evocation]] [[magic]] before a large chunk of the Long Span collapsed and fell into the water. Although they won the fight, losses were high and fires on the north end resulted in innocent lives lost.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = ...the Shou control that bridge and we shouldn't go anywhere near it.\n| source = [[Rhetegast Hawkwinter|Rhett Hawkwinter]], 1480 DR\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nAfter Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Harbor Cross (as well as the other two bridges) was destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river.
