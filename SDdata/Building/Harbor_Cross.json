        "mainbody": "he Harbor Cross was a bridge that spanned the River Mirar in Luskan. It was actually two bridges the Short Span, which connected the citys South Bank to Blood Island, and the Long Span which connected Blood Island to the citys North Bank. The entirety of the bridge was sometimes referred to as the Long Span, and it was briefly known as Blood Bridge in the late 15 century DR.\nOf the three bridges that crossed the River Mirar within Luskan (the other two being Dalaths Span and the Upstream Span), Harbor Cross was the southernmost and therefore the furthest downstream. Blood Island sat in the middle of the bridge, which served as the garrison for Luskans troops.\nWhen forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the , fierce resistance was expected and encountered on the Harbor Cross bridge. In particular, Lord Brambleberrys forces got pinned down by evocation magic before a large chunk of the Long Span collapsed and fell into the water. Although they won the fight, losses were high and fires on the north end resulted in innocent lives lost.\nAfter Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the Spellplague in the , Harbor Cross (as well as the other two bridges) was destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river. In the decades that followed, local gangs would occasionally refurbish it into a makeshift crossing&mdashsometimes as little more than a series of ropes&mdashin hopes of charging tolls. These repairs never lasted and the bridge remained impassable through the , but it was more effectively rebuilt the following year. This incarnation was known as the Blood Bridge, and was controlled by the Dragonbloods&mdasha Shou gang based on Blood Island.\nBy the , the bridge was once again known as Harbor Cross and Blood Island once more housed Luskans soldiers. Use of the bridge was restricted to members of Luskans Ships or to those otherwise approved by the High Captains of Luskan.\n* Blood Island\n* Red Dragon Trading Lodge"
