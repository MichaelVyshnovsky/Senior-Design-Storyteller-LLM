The Dragonvipers Anchor was an inn located in the city of Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.
A large anchor that was once equipped on the Dragonviper ship dominated the front foyer. The inn appeared old and worn out.
Olem Surtrar, who was once the captain of the Dragonviper, owned and operated the inn.
The Dragonvipers Anchor was quite comfortable despite its aged appearance.
