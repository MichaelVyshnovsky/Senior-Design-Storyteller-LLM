        "mainbody": "Gundercove was a ramshackle lodging for sailors, found in Tulmene on the Tethyr Peninsula in the late 14 century DR.\nThe inn was once a fish shed, evidenced by its persistent stench and the constant dampness of Tulmenes docks, built atop wharves with the waves crashing against the inns dining room. The buildings roof was a patchwork of rusting metal and white whale oil and seal hide sealants that kept the ceiling from leaking.\nGundercove was drowned in raucous of unruly sailors, bawling of seabirds, smashing and moving of barrels, and stacking of the docks. The sound became a thunderous cacophony every time it rained as the drops banged on the metal roof plates.\nThe inn offered simple lodgings to sailors. Its humble private rooms were furnished with straw and rope mattresses and hammocks, clothing pegs, a single chair, and a candle lamp. As for hygiene, each tiny room came with a nightbucket and a jug of water for washing up. In comparison to more cosmopolitan places, Gundercove was cheap however, its prices were comparable to other sleeping arrangements found in Tulmene.\nGundercove was mentioned in Volothamp Geddarms guide to the Lands of Intrigue, and the author warned any decent-looking female guest to expect to be mistaken for a companion by its sailors and asked for her price."
