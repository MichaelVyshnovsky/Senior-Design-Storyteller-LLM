        "mainbody": "'''Gundercove''' was a ramshackle lodging for sailors, found in [[Tulmene]] on the [[Tethyr Peninsula]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The inn was once a [[fish]] shed, evidenced by its persistent stench and the constant dampness of Tulmene's docks, built atop wharves with the waves crashing against the inn's dining room. The building's roof was a patchwork of rusting metal and white [[whale oil]] and [[seal]] hide sealants that kept the ceiling from leaking.",
        "Interior": "Gundercove was drowned in raucous of unruly sailors, bawling of seabirds, smashing and moving of [[barrel]]s, and stacking of the docks. The sound became a thunderous cacophony every time it rained as the drops banged on the metal roof plates.",
        "Services": "The inn offered simple lodgings to sailors. Its humble private rooms were furnished with straw and rope mattresses and hammocks, clothing pegs, a single chair, and a [[candle]] [[lamp]]. As for [[hygiene]], each tiny room came with a nightbucket and a jug of water for washing up. In comparison to more cosmopolitan places, Gundercove was cheap; however, its prices were comparable to other sleeping arrangements found in Tulmene.",
        "History": "Gundercove was mentioned in [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s guide to the [[Lands of Intrigue]], and the author warned any decent-looking female guest to expect to be mistaken for a companion by its sailors and asked for her price."
