The Flamesight Mosque was a temple located in the City of Brass in 1367 DR.
This mosque was found in the Furnace ward of the city.
This mosque was built to resemble a pyramid. The entire structure was made from copper that never tarnished.
The Flamesight Mosque was dedicated to Hastsezini, who was also simply called "Fire." Since Hastezini was a hungry god who demanded sacrifice, the noble efreet kept him satiated with rich offerings. Most of the public burnings carried out in the City of Brass were performed at the base of the Flamesight Mosque.
The priesthood of Hastezini was small. Similar to the god they venerated, they were vengeful and arrogant.
