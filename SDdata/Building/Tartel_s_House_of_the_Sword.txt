'''Tartel's House of the Sword''' was a finishing school in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], that secretly operated as a brothel on the side.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/07-21 - Finishing Schools in the Realms}}

==Location==
This school was located along [[Seawatch Street]], in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of Waterdeep.

==Services==
Tartel's publicly advertised services were training in the art of fencing and how to defend one's self with the use of (or against) a [[dagger]], light [[longsword]], or other smaller forms of blades.

On the side, the school taught young nobles how to duel and the chance to get companionship from [[coin-lass]]es. The proprietor, [[Tartel]], encouraged young and beautiful women to work for her as coin-lasses in return for half of their earnings. These women were given the option of staying at Tartel's, taking on the guise of a student or maid, though they had to pay full student rates.
