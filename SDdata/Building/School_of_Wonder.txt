The '''School of Wonder''' was once a well-respected [[mage]]s' academy in [[Amn]] that, following a magical disaster, became the reason for outlawing magic in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The School of Wonder stood to the northwest of [[Hillfort Ishla]], north of the [[Small Teeth]] mountain range.

==History==
The School of Wonder of Amn was established in the {{YearlinkName|1219}} by the wizards [[Myrdon]] and [[Salasker]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1257}} a famous ''[[spellbook]]'' – ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'' was penned at the school by aging [[Bowgentle]], who arrived to the school shortly before his death.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|30}} At some point during the school's existence, the ''[[Folio of Brass]]'' was penned by members of the academy. It was one of the very few records that proved the existence of illusive [[elf|elven]] [[safehold]] – [[Myth Dyraalis]].

The School of Wonder came to an end in the {{YearlinkName|1266}}, when power-mad students unleashed an army of [[tanar'ri]] that ravaged the Amnian countryside and almost completely eradicated all students and Masters of the school. A little known fact was that the disaster was the result of the ''[[Demonshield]]s'' recovered from the [[Fields of the Dead]] by members of the school. During the artifacts' study, some unknown event occurred, possibly an attempt to destroy the items, and creatures imprisoned within were unleashed and in turn summoned an army of their fiendish kin. The fiends promised power to weak-willed students of the school, gaining willing allies in the destruction that left the school a ruin.

The rampage had long-lasting consequences as the King [[Dhanar Parhek]] banned the usage of magic, proclaiming it seditious, both divine and arcane. The [[Athkatla/Temple District|Temple District]] of Athkatla, along with its temples, abbeys, and a mage school, were torched in the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1267}}. His heavy-handed attempts to quell the uncontrolled violence and destruction that followed led to his assassination in [[1276 DR]], putting an end to the monarchy of Amn.

Wizards became greatly distrusted and feared after the events at the School of Wonder. Wizards such as [[Orgoth]] the Tainted had to build their towers in distant, unsettled lands, rather than in urban areas (Orgoth was coincidentally killed by fiends that he summoned). The old [[Mystic's Academy]] of [[Llorbauth]], [[Erlkazar]], had links to the School of Wonder, and greatly outlived its sibling school. The legacy of the School of Wonder remained a part of Amn well into the late 14{{th}} century DR, as the infamous [[Cowled Wizards]] adapted the School of Wonder's graduate hooded robes as their uniform.

==Notable Inhabitants==
*Iltarch [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]], the Grandmaster of the [[Shadow Thieves]] who took the position in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. At an early point in his unnaturally long life, Rhinnom had an abruptly severed career at the School of Wonder.
