The '''Monastery of the Ebon Dome''' was a [[Shar]]ran temple built by the [[Order of the Dark Moon]] long before the [[Era of Upheaval]]. It was later repurposed in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by a contingent of [[Church of Cyric|Cyricist]] militants called the [[Company of the Ebon Spur]], a group that aligned themselves with the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]].

{{Quote|As expected, the Sharrans hide their secrets well, but I did discover something that might lead us to understanding their ultimate plan...the piece of parchment I've attached with this letter, praise be to [[Cyric]]. I believe it to be the writings of a monk that once lived
in the Monastery of the Ebon Dome.|Excerpt from an undelivered letter addressed to Blackwill [[Haarken Akhmelere]], written by [[Bineera Ethar]].}}

==Location==
The monastery was situated atop a hill on the eastern end of the Whispermere in the [[Shadow Swamp]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]]. A small, barely-illuminated dock was built on the bank of the river, approximately {{SI|0.5|mi|k}} away .

It was accessible from [[Toril]] by means of the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]], a ''[[portal]]'' found inside the [[Lost Refuge]] within the [[Vast Swamp]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Structure==
The monastery comprised three stone buildings and two support structures surrounding a central courtyard, connected by several staircases and walkways. The entirety of the premises was built atop a small hillock and was well-protected by both its elevation and mortared stone walls.

A trail leading up from the nearby docks led to the monastery's gatehouse and adjoining stable, both of which had become dilapidated over time. The Dark Moon monks' refectory was situated in the southeast end of the structure, and the priory was built on the elevation just north.

The northern structure housed the monk's library, scriptorium, along with the Black Chapel. The roof over the chapel was capped with the large black dome that lent the monastery its name.

==Interior==

Like the outer structure, much of monastery's chambers were left in ruin. Doors were battered down, furniture was collapsed and useless, and debris lay scattered across nearly every room within. Any books or other valuables found amidst the ruins were relocated by the Cyricists to the temple's priory, the single building that remained relatively intact. Overall the Ebon Spur had amassed a small fortune, worth over 5,000 [[gp]]

===Atmosphere===
The monastery and its sinister trappings were wholly unsettling. Crumbling infrasttucture and ruined decor made for an uncomfortable place to stay. The constant murmurs and wails emanating from the Cyricists' vigilant protector did little to encourage restfulness.

==Activities==
Originally, the temple was built as place of meditation for the monks of the Dark Moon, a sanctuary from which they could think upon the nature and significance of the [[Black Rift]]. After being rediscovered, it was rededicated to [[Cyric]] the Black Sun.

==Defenses==
Two [[kir-lanan]]s allied with [[Despayr]] and the Sharrans dwelled within the inner courtyard, serving as sentries and messnegers to the powerful black dragon.

Ethar and her Cyricists brought with them a gift in offering to Despayr, a [[gloom golem]] that remained within the monastery's Black Chapel. The terrifying construct served as their protector while staying within the Plane fo Shadow.

==History==
At some point in its history, the monastery was abandoned by the monk of the Dark Moon but remained a closely-guarded secret of their goddess Shar.

During the late 14{{th}} century, the [[Cormyr]]ean [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]] devised his plan to created a [[dead-magic zone]] over the Shadow Swamp in order rend [[the Weave]] in Shar's name. To best fulfill his plan, the Nightmother directed him to utilize the Monastery of the Ebon Dome, 

When Despayr and the Sharrans began their [[ritual]] at the Black Rift, they employed a contingent [[Cyricist]] led by [[Bineera Ethar]] protectors to watch over and protect them from the monastery.
