The '''Gate of Eagles''' was found in the city of [[Muluk]] in the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Location==
The Gate of Eagles was located on the eastern wall of the city. The [[Mount of Forgiveness]] was found just beyond the Gate of Eagles outside of Muluk.

==Description==
A pair of [[eagle]]s were carved into the framework of the gate, giving the portal its name.

==Inhabitants==
A garrison of 200 soldiers was stationed at the Gate of Eagles, making the gate a fortress as much as it was an entryway into Muluk.
