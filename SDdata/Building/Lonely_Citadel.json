        "mainbody": "Ice Mountains, Faerûn\nThe Lonely Citadel was a gargantuan tower that was originally of Faerûn.\nThis tower formed the top of a spire in the mountain range known as the Ice Mountains. It resided north of the dwarven stronghold, Citadel Adbar.\nOnly a single turret was attached to this tower.\nIn 1365 DR, the Lonely Citadel was spirited away from the Prime Material plane in a great burst of divine energy. The citadel later appeared in Mount Celestia when Torm was elevated to the status of a lesser deity. The tower itself came to form the heart of Trueheart in Mercuria."
