The Thayan enclave in Scardale Town was a building from which the Red Wizards exerted their power within the region in late 14 century DR. Their primary service to the people of the Dalelands was the sale of magical items, at quite reasonable prices.
The Red Wizards who chose to operate out of Scardale distinctly contrasted with their native brethren of Thay. These wizards typically kept a neutral alignment and were quite trustworthy compared to the other organizations operating out of Scardale Town at the time. These Red Wizards even forewent the practice of slavery, and
as such earned the tolerance of local Harpers.
The Thayan wizards from this enclave often used the Four Dolphins Fountain as a meeting place, due its magical protection from scrying.
