The '''Thayan enclave''' in [[Scardale Town]] was a building from which the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] exerted their power within the region in late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their primary service to the people of the [[Dalelands]] was the sale of magical items, at quite reasonable prices.

==Personnel==
The Red Wizards who chose to operate out of [[Scardale]] distinctly contrasted with their native brethren of [[Thay]]. These wizards typically kept a [[neutral]] alignment and were quite trustworthy compared to the other organizations operating out of Scardale Town at the time. These Red Wizards even forewent the practice of slavery, and
as such earned the tolerance of local [[Harpers]].

The [[Thay]]an [[wizard]]s from this enclave often used the [[Four Dolphins Fountain]] as a meeting place, due its [[magic]]al protection from [[scry]]ing.
