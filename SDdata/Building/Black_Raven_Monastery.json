        "mainbody": "organizations =\n}}\n'''Black Raven Monastery''' was founded in [[1181 DR]] by [[Valas Belaem del Pharm]] and dedicated to the teachings of the [[Black Raven (person)|Black Raven]], a near mythical hero and a quasi-deity of the [[Uthgardt]] people.",
        "Location": "The monastery was located in the [[Spine of the World]] and connected Valas' Tomb to the [[Underdark]].",
        "Interior": "There were three floors to the [[monastery]]. The ground floor was the most used floor, and the general hub of the monastery. Upon entering the building, was an entrance hall which held a gathering of monks. Further along was a large combat training area for practising in unarmed combat. There was also a dedicated library, but many bookshelves all around the monastery. Other rooms in this floor consisted of a storage room, quarters (archmandrite's, guests', and monks') and a kitchen.\n\nThe lower floor held a lobby, stationed by a monk, and nine rooms to host ''the Eight Chambers''. Each room was vastly different in both size, color and style.\n\nThe bottom floor was essentially an underground cavern, bearing Valas' tomb. The tomb was surrounded by four iron golems, and would activate if the tomb was disturbed. The area was protected by many gates bearing the symbol of the Black Raven.",

            "General": "The [[monk]]s of the monastery were taught to fight [[slavery]] of any kind, even imprisoning a criminal was prohibited by the monastery's philosophy. Furthermore, since Valas Black Raven was once a slave, the monks believed all servants were to be treated with respect. Monks would follow Valas' values and were taught to fight in unarmed combat.",
            "Initiation": "Only monks were allowed to visit Valas' Tomb. In order to become one of these monks, one had to master ''the Eight Chambers''. The newest monk of the order would become the ''Master of Chambers'', and give up that position once another monk joined the monastery. The ''master'' would show potential initiates from chamber to chamber, and instruct them on the trials ahead.",
            "The Eight Chambers": "The Eight Chambers were a series of trials which had to be completed in order to join the Black Raven Monastery. The lower floor of the monastery was dedicated to these sets of trials. Initiates looking to join had to enter each chamber without their armor, weapons and items. They could only use a small selection of weapons available in the chambers. Due to the deadliness of the trials, many challengers died within."

        "History": "After his escape from slavery, Valas Belaem del Pharm founded the monastery in 1181. In the late 13th and early 14th centuries DR, [[Ormis Dohor]] lead the monks of the monastery. The title of the current leader of the monastery was archimandrite. Ormis took leave to visit the [[Legion of the Chimera]] capitol at the [[Severed Hand]], and left [[Aruma Blane]] in charge. When Ormis refused to side with the legion, an envoy named [[Dolon Daemba]] was commanded to corrupt Aruma and make sure that the monastery kept out of the legion's business. Aruma was a harsh leader, and exiled every monk which spoke out against her.\n\nAfter Dolon's plans were exposed by a group of adventurers, he confessed his love for Aruma. He then convinced her to leave [[Faerun]] with him, to his place of origin, [[Sigil]]. Aruma left control of the monastery to [[Salisam Harbash]] as part of a three monk council.\n\nSometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR, a splinter group of monks left the Black Raven Monastery, establishing the [[Dark Ravens]] – a monastic order of [[assassin]]s for hire. The group operated out of the [[Dark Raven Monastery]]. One notable victim of their lethal arts was [[drow]] [[House Uoswiir]] of [[Menzoberranzan]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The monastery held many monks, all of which followed the current archimandrite. The monastery seldom had visitors, but were sometimes visited by adventuring groups."
