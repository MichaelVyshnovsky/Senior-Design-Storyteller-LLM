        "mainbody": "he Sailors Own was a rather shabby tavern near the docks in Waterdeeps Castle Ward.\nThis tavern stood on Sail Street, across from the mouth of Tarnished Silver Alley.\nThis building stood a single story tall. Due to its proximity to the docks, there was a strong smell outside of fish and rotting seaweed.\nThe ceilings in this building were rather low-beamed.\nThis place was regularly crowded and filled with the smell of various, and often exotic, tobaccos.\nThere were often men playing some form of board game or cards and whenever a man got too drunk they were left to sleep the night through. Those who were feeling sick were expected to make their way outside of the building. And anyone who started a fight was likely to be thrown out the front door by the taverns proprietor.\nThe Sailors Own served horse, pork, and oxen meat. They were served in either roast portions, at a price of two copper pieces per platter, or stewed with onions and greens for a price of one copper piece per bowl.\nIn terms of beverages, the Sailors Own served ale at 2 cp per tankard,\nBesides the usual tavern provender, the proprietor Guthlakh Imyiir sold a variety of nautical charts of areas along the Sword Coast and areas around the Sea of Swords at prices ranging from 45 gold pieces and up, with his best or rare charts fetching prices upwards of hundreds."
