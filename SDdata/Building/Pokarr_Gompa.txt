'''Pokarr Gompa''' was a monastery (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]]. It was nicknamed the '''Right Hand of U'Chan'''.

==Geography==
It stood in central Tabot, at the northern edge of the [[Haraki Ridge]]. Its position south of the capital [[U'Chan Gompa]] gave it its title; it stood opposite [[Lii Gompa]], the Left Hand of U'Chan.

==Description==
The monastery was formerly a fortress, built deep into the side of a mountain. The old keep still stood at the heart of the gompa. Beneath it lay tunnels or catacombs that stretched for miles.

==Defenses==
The entrance to Pokarr Gompa had three wide gates made of stone that could be swung open or closed in a moment. For defense of the realm, it boasted a strong militia, including a fearsome cavalry, and they were known to have beat back attackers on countless occasions. Temple guards were garbed in dark-green pants and blouses, and wielded [[scimitar]]s.

==Interior==
Pokarr Gompa famously housed many of great treasures and tomes of Tabot. In its four libraries were such works as [[Wang Tcu Lor]]'s religious treatises, [[Soo Enlahm]]'s journals and natural histories, and [[Ischan]]'s and [[Doka'zar]]'s masterpieces. The three separate treasure rooms kept secure the religious relics of Tabot, including holy remains, bones made of stone, a magical tapestry that hypnotized those who viewed it,<ref> and many more. Also in the treasure rooms, rather than the libraries, was a five-volume holy book written by the first High Lord of Oceans, [[H'Dang Li]].

==History==
It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Pokarr.

The warrior [[Zife Yur]] went into the catacombs below Pokarr Gompa in {{YearlinkConvert|2267|SY}} and was never seen again. Thereafter, the lamas forbade anyone from going into them.

For a great festival at the [[Temple of Heaven's Heart]] on [[Mount E'kwong]] ''circa'' 2607, Abbot Mo Kin chose the monk scribe Pang to represent Pokarr Gompa, releasing him from an eight-year-long vow of silence in the process. On a [[pilgrim]]age to the site, accompanied by five temple guards, Pang spoke of Tabot to the Dragon Lord [[Mei Lung]], who was attending as a guest from [[Shou Lung]].

==Relationships==
Pokarr Gompa was the primary rival to neighboring Lii Gompa. This might be why Pang spoke little of Lii to Mei Lung. Pang was also dismissive of [[Nafeen Gompa]] and [[Zotung Gompa]], declaring they did not follow "the true and holy laws of the High Lord" as Pokarr did.

Pokarr Gompa regularly sent delegations to [[Do'dzin Gompa]] for four of its annual festivals.

==Inhabitants==
It housed over a thousand lamas and novices. They trained with the [[sword]], learnt [[calligraphy]], and were permitted to practice one other artform, as a devotion to the deities. They commonly chose to make pottery, using clay from south of [[Rokstang]], and their works were renowned throughout Tabot. The greatest of their potters worked [[magic]] into the clay.

Pokarr Gompa was led by Abbot [[Mo Kin]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}.

==Activities==
The abbot of Pokarr was also commander of the militia, and was responsible for patrolling Tabot's eastern border with [[Shou Lung]] north of Mount E'kwong.
