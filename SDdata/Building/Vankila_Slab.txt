Spellcasters
Vankila Slab was an aerial prison that soared over the realm of Muranndin, and remained there as of the late 15 century DR.
The prison comprised four circular towers that were built atop a floating earthmote, atop which sat a stone fortification known as the Sky Tomb. The stretch of open area at the base of the tower, where prisoners were forced to work, was known as the Turf.
For some time, Vankila Slab was home to an individual known as the Practitioner, a powerful mage who conducted horrific experiments on its prisoners.
The ogre guardsmen regularly patrolled the edges of Vankila Slabs mote, to prevent prisoners from jumping off the edge to their freedom.
Vankila Slab was originally built by the Houses of Amn, to imprison spellcasters that defied Amnish law that prohibited the unregulated use of magic. Within a decade however, it became controlled by a single organization that held power throughout Amn and Tethyr, and was repurposed as a general prison for the realms most heinous criminals. After the discovery of valuable gems within the prisons earthmote, those criminals were put to hard labor as miners.
By the 1470s DR, the prison became more of a twisted laboratory-prison, a place where the Practitioner and their colleagues could conduct their twisted arcane experiments.
It was said that Vankila Slab was a site of such brutality that even birds dared not fly too close to its edge.
Most prisoners of Vankila Slab were non-human, extremely violent criminals.
