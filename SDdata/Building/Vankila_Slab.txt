'''Vankila Slab''' was an aerial prison that soared over the realm of [[Muranndin]], and remained there as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The prison comprised four circular towers that were built atop a floating [[earthmote]], atop which sat a stone fortification known as the 'Sky Tomb'. The stretch of open area at the base of the tower, where prisoners were forced to work, was known as 'the Turf'.

==Activity==
For some time, Vankila Slab was home to an individual known as [[the Practitioner]], a powerful [[mage]] who conducted horrific experiments on its prisoners.

The [[ogre]] guardsmen regularly patrolled the edges of Vankila Slab's mote, to prevent prisoners from jumping off the edge to their freedom.

==History==
Vankila Slab was originally built by the [[Houses of Amn]], to imprison [[spellcaster]]s that defied [[Amn#Magic|Amnish law]] that prohibited the unregulated use of magic. Within a decade however, it became controlled by a single organization that held power throughout [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]], and was repurposed as a general prison for the realm's most heinous criminals. After the discovery of valuable [[gem]]s within the prison's earthmote, those criminals were put to hard labor as miners.

By the 1470s [[DR]], the prison became more of a twisted laboratory-prison, a place where the Practitioner and their colleagues could conduct their twisted arcane experiments.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was said that Vankila Slab was a site of such brutality that even [[bird]]s dared not fly too close to its edge.

==Inhabitants==
Most prisoners of Vankila Slab were non-[[human]], extremely violent criminals.

===Notable Prisoners===
* [[Amhar]], the [[dwarf]] guardsman convicted of committing the [[Children's Massacre]].
* [[Harp Levesque]], a sailor and pirate who was imprisoned for "mutiny".
