Goldengulp Brewery was a brewery located in the Chauntean farm-complex known as Goldenfields.
The Goldengulp Brewery was located in the center of Goldenfields, near the residential buildings.
The brewery was established within a two-story estate.
Adjoined to the rear side of the structure was a large watchtower referred to as the Dragons Spire. It was so named for a bronze dragon that once perched upon its peak.
Goldengulp was known for the production of its namesake beer. It was served at the local Northfurrows End inn.
About 60 individuals worked in the brewery, as of the late 15 century DR.
