The '''House of the Moon''' was a temple of [[Selûne]] in the city of [[Waterdeep]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Waterdeep and the North|23,29}}{{cite book/The Savage Frontier|12,34}}{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|136}} It was one of the largest temples in the city It was the center of much moon-related activity in and around Waterdeep.

==Location==
[[File:Diamond Street & Seawatch Street.png|thumb|left|''A map of the surrounding streets.'']]
The House of the Moon stood in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of Waterdeep and faced the south side of [[Diamond Street]] between [[Seawatch Street]] and the [[Street of Whispers]]. Running around the temple on the east, west, and south sides was a passage known as Moonlit Alley. It stood two blocks east of the West Gate and opposite the [[Tchazzam]] family villa, and further east lay the [[Moonstar]] family villa. It was one of the most significant temples of the Sea Ward.

==Structure==
[[File:HouseOfTheMoon-color.png|thumb|left|''A sketch of the House of the Moon from the front.'']]
It was an imposing edifice with a magnificent entrance that dominated the block and was more grandiose than most of the neighboring noble villas. Every window was built in the shape of a full or crescent moon.

After the events of the Time of Troubles, it received new front gates of ornate design. These depicted a triumphant Selûne throwing a defeated Shar down amongst the spires of Waterdeep.

By [[1492 DR]], the House of the Moon was still quite beautiful and now had the tallest temple tower in Waterdeep, with a height of approximately {{SI|75|ft|long=yes}} above street level. From its top, priests could receive moonlight in all seasons.

==Defenses==
[[File: Knights of the Half Moon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Two Knights of the Half Moon trying, and failing, to hold the main doors. Not pictured: the centaur kicking them in.'']]
To block [[scrying]], the outer walls were lined with [[lead]] between the granite core and the marble façade. These marble tiles were cemented with [[gorgon]]'s blood [[mortar]], By 1370 DR, the windows were protected by a ''[[wall of force]]''. In addition, a silvery shining dome of magical force enveloped the temple roof; it could be made opaque or transparent at the high priestess's direction.

Inside the temple, any Selûnite priest of sufficient rank could freely conjure a ''[[moon blade]]'', ''[[moonweb]]'', or ''[[wall of moonlight]]''.

For more martial defense, the Knights of the Half Moon made regular six-strong patrols of the temple, which passed through some areas two or three times an hour. Moreover, groups of two or three stood guard at all hours in the entrance hall, narthex, the east and west guard towers,

==Interior==
Inside, the décor was largely grays, whites, and blues, after the moon and the sea. Above the baseboards, the lower halves of the walls were covered in vertical [[oak]] panels, firmly fitted and colored a deep blue. Midway up was a horizontal strip of oak molding that was painted a deep sea-blue. Above this, the walls were plastered over in a light aquamarine that shaded to white near the ceiling. In the corridors and many chambers, the ceilings were semicircular arches and domes. In the corridors, these were supported by curved oak fames approximately every {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} and adjoining the molding on either side; their design was reminiscent of a crescent moon. Below, the floors were covered with circular white marble tiles inlaid with [[iris agate]] in designs based on important imagery of the faith. Illumination was provided by twinkling ''[[moongleam]]'' runes on the ceilings and streaks of silvery ''[[continual faerie fire]]'' moving along the floors. Arched doorways connect the hallways and chambers.

All throughout, it was lavishly decorated, with pale pink and blue tapestries hung on the walls and carpets of matching hues. Large urns stood in some corners and on plinths and tables. The moon and its phases were depicted everywhere, from over the arches to along the walls and even in gratings.

The temple had a number of hidden spaces and passages, from concealed cavities to whole tunnels. These occupied hollows in the interior walls and were accessed by secret doors, each with a different opening mechanism. Apparently only high priestess Naneatha Suaril and Lady Alathene Moonstar knew the location and trigger of every secret door, but various visitors and infiltrators had discovered some of them over the temple's history. Similarly, many of the floor tiles contained secret compartments, which could be accessed by pressing adjacent tiles in a certain sequence.

===Ground/First Floor===
[[File:HotM-1stFloor.png|thumb|500px|right|''A plan of the first or ground floor.'']]
[[File:House of the Moon - hall.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The entrance hall and narthex, where a thief wonders at the extravagance.'']]
;Entrance Hall:
:The main doors led directly into the entrance hall (#1). Although laid out simply, it was elegant and impressive in architecture. The vaulted ceiling was semicylindrical in shape and up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. Lining both sides of the hall were overhanging balcony galleries. The whole area was designed for beauty, not defense—the arrow slits in the walls and murder holes in the balconies were fairly discreet. Down the center were three free-standing plinths bearing rare urns from [[Halruaa]]; they had no magical auras, but legend claimed each held a servitor [[djinn]] that would emerge to protect the temple if disturbed. Despite this, Onyx was able to smash one without repercussions, which was apparently something to do with a dwarf's non-magical nature. Two Knights of the Half Moon stood guard inside the main doors at all times, and a patrol came by two or three times an hour.
;Narthex:
:Adjoining the entrance hall in the south was the [[Wikipedia:narthex|narthex]] (#2), which served as the main entrance to the temple proper. Normally quiet but for echoing whispers, it was noisy and bustling both before and after services when dozens of the faith assembled here, and when galas were held here. The galleries of the entrance hall continued here: the western gallery was a choir loft and the eastern gallery was nicknamed the Crow's Nest, for sailors most often visited it. Daises of low stone steps led up to the curtained entrance of the Church of the Moon and Stars in the south, the doors to the Chapel of the Waxing Moon in the east, and the doors to the Chapel of the Waning Moon in the west. These were heavy ironbound double [[Wikipedia:lancet window|lancet]] doors with large [[brass]] handles, and each had a Knight of the Half Moon on guard.
;East and West Guard Towers
:In the northeast and northwest corners each stood a triplet of towers; the larger central towers had two stories, the others one. Formerly the temple's primary guard posts, its envelopment by the city almost entirely obscured their view. Regardless, two Knights were posted to each, and they usually conversed and wandered between the towers. The east guard towers (#5) were identical to the west guard towers (#4), except for a small bubbling spring by the west wall of the southernmost tower in the east; this produced excellent-tasting sparkling mineral water. A ladder and trapdoor led up to the domed upper levels of the central towers, and connected to the galleries over the entrance hall.
;Hallway of Archers
:Flanking the entrance hall on the east and west, behind the discreet arrow slits, were the two hallways (#3)  that gave passage from the narthex to the east and west guard towers. Up to eight archers could be stationed in each to fire on any who invaded the temple via the main doors. These were something of a relic of earlier times when the temple stood outside Waterdeep's walls, and while a guard from each tower garrison was assigned to patrol the hallways constantly, they typically stayed together in the towers to avoid this lonely, tedious duty.
;Chapel of the Waxing Moon
:This was the counterpart of the Chapel of the Waning Moon (#6). East off the narthex, the Chapel of the Waxing Moon was used on nights of the waxing moon and in early morning hours, and generally by faithful walking in for private worship, contentment, and sanctuary. When in use, a minor priest was stationed here to perform rites, provide counselling, and cast spells of ''[[augury]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[chant]]'', and ''[[prayer]]'' (and they were instructed to prepare all they could) for the faithful.
:On entering, the room was almost dark, but it gradually illuminated to the brightness of a crescent moon over about three minutes—people who entered at different times would actually perceive different illuminations, with one in dark, another in light. At the center of the chapel hovered, by the will of Selûne, a simple crescent moon made of [[mithral]] and treated with ''[[everbright]]''. Below it was a small [[silver]] offering bowl, which was linked by a permanent ''[[Blaenther's bowls]]'' spell to a counterpart in the cimeliarch. On the north wall hung a tapestry displaying a montage of peaceful images of good will, contemplation, and spiritual renewal. On the east wall was a ''[[permanent illusion]]'' that gave a sense of standing on a mountain ledge overlooking a forest beneath a starry sky and crescent moon.
;Choraula & Vestry
:Behind the Chapel of the Waxing Moon was the [https://www.wordnik.com/words/choraula choraula] (#7), wherein the Choir of the Moon rehearsed and sang hymns whenever the moon was out, night and day. The rooms had excellent acoustics, enabling even a whisper in the vestry to be heard in the narthex. The rear door led to the grand stair.
:Illumination was provided by ''[[continual light]]'' spells on the ceiling. The room was also occupied by a drifting swarm of [[crystalmist]]s that fed on the light spells. A very old spell stopped them from both leaving the room and adopting their defense formation. Only a moderately experienced Selûnite priest could make them coalesce and attack others.
:In the vestry (#8) were stored the robes for the choir and a sizeable collection of silver hand [[bell]]s. A chest in the southeast corner (for which the choirmaster had the only key) held the 121 celebrated hymns of the Moonmaiden, written on parchment.
;Chapel of the Waning Moon
:This was the counterpart of the Chapel of the Waxing Moon (#9). West off the narthex, the Chapel of the Waning Moon was used on nights of the waning moon and in early evening hours, and generally by faithful walking in for private worship, contentment, and sanctuary. When in use, a minor priest was stationed here to perform rites, provide counselling, and cast spells of ''[[augury]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[chant]]'', and ''[[prayer]]'' (and they were instructed to prepare all they could) for the faithful.
:On entering, the room was fairly well lit, but gradually dimmed to the brightness of starlight over about three minutes—people who entered at different times would actually perceive different illuminations, with one in light, another in dark. At the center of the chapel hovered, by the will of Selûne, a simple inverted crescent moon made of mithral and treated with ''everbright''. Below it was a small silver offering bowl, which was linked by a permanent ''Blaenther's bowls'' spell to a counterpart in the cimeliarch. On the north wall hung a tapestry displaying the eternal battle between Selûne and Shar. On the west wall was a ''permanent illusion'' that gave a sense of standing within a deep mountain cave, with a single shaft of moonlight as the only guide to safety.
;Aspersorium of Immersion
:Behind the Chapel of the Waning Moon was a small chamber housing an [[Wikipedia:Aspersorium| aspersorium]] (#10). This was a marble font of cool [[holy water]] that bubbled continuously, not through magic but pipes and pressure. Here, visitors were to cleanse their hands and faces and take a long drink before passing through the southern door to the long refectory.
;Church of the Moon and Stars
:The main chapel, however, and the heart of the temple, was the Church of the Moon and Stars (#11). From the narthex, a magnificent curtained semicircular arch led into the nave. On the east and west sides, a door in the north corner and a curtained arch at the transept led to the Grand Stair and long refectory, respectively. At the far end, a half-moon-shaped dais supported the altar. The nave and altar were overlooked by the seven arched balconies of the triforium on the second story.
:The arched roof was covered with a ''permanent illusion'' displaying a moonlit night with all the [[constellation]]s and the moon in its current phase as seen from Waterdeep. Illumination was produced by flickering silvery ''driftglobes'' and no spell of ''[[darkness]]'' or the like would ever work here. Selûnites who worshiped here were automatically adorned with the "Moonmaiden's Caress", a flickering silver ''[[faerie fire]]'' that lasted as long as they were here and for three minutes after leaving.
:On the dais before the altar's argent [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frontal frontal], the replica ''Wand of Four Moons'' was displayed in a warded ''[[glassteel]]'' case. Within the case, the wand levitated and glowed with a soft silvery-blue light, and worshipers witnessed various manifestations of the goddess from it.
:There were no less than four priests working here at any one time, and up to forty priests during moonrise and moonset services. Moreover, two high-ranked silverstars guarded the ''Wand of Four Moons'' constantly and wielded potent defensive magic items.
;Long Refectory
:West of the nave, behind the arch, was the long refectory (#12), a grand banquet hall intended for both large social gatherings and everyday meals by the priests at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but it saw regular use outside these times. Only guard patrols came through at nights.
:Wood paneling, of rare timbers like teak, covered the walls and the ceilings were hung with numerous pennants. The key feature, though, was the enormous {{SIAdj|35|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} mahogany dining table with seating enough for forty people. The lighting was equivalent to moonlight, with no obvious source. The curtain to the Church of the Moon and Stairs was specially enchanted to mute all noises transmitted between the rooms when it drawn closed.
;Serving Room
:Behind the long refectory was the serving room (#14), a plain chamber where food was prepared, servers assembled, and dishes were washed. It was little-used outside meal times. It had doors to the west pantry and kitchen.
;West Pantry
:In the west pantry (#16) was kept the [[bread]]s, grains, fruits, vegetables, and [[herb]]s. The room was illuminated by three ''driftglobes''. For relative cooling, a small [[brown mold]] colony was carefully maintained in a sealed [[barrel]] in a small {{SIAdj|8|ft|long=yes|adj=deep}} pit in the center of the room, kept safely under a locked grate to keep people more than {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} way. A sign on the door forbade anyone taking fire or any other heat source inside.
;Kitchen
:At the rear of the temple was the kitchen (#15), a smoky chamber where all the temple's food was cooked. Against the south wall stood two huge hearths, identical in design and big enough for a human to stand inside. Opposite these was a small well that descended to a natural spring over {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} below. All around the room were small tables for food preparation, and many pots, pans, and utensils were kept hanging from [[rope]]s strung across the ceiling. In the northeastern corner lay a large stone tub containing a well-looked-after [[green slime]] used to dispose of garbage.
:This was a hectic and noisy place through the day and deep into the night and early morning. More than a dozen cooks worked here and two aspirants tended the fires, while a senior priest oversaw matters. They were equipped with a ''[[ring of warmth]]'' for comfort in the refrigeration pantry and a ''[[staff of curing]]'' to heal injuries and to fend off the green slime if it got out of control.
;Kitchen Pantry
:Adjoining the kitchen, the kitchen pantry (#17) was used as a meat locker and refrigerator, usually containing at least twenty carcasses hanging from metal hooks in the ceiling and at least thirty [[cask]]s of [[ale]], [[mead]], and [[milk]] stacked by the walls.
:As in the west pantry, the area was cooled by a large brown mold colony contained within a stone tub in the center of the chamber. It was so cold that one required a ''ring of warmth'' or similar magic to enter; one ring was in the possession of the senior priest on duty, and another hung on a hook by the door. A sign on the door forbade anyone taking fire or any other heat source inside and the door was kept locked, with the on-duty senior priest in the kitchen carrying the only key.
;Public Privies
:East of the kitchen were the public privies, with a large room on the north side for men and three smaller chambers on the south for women. Each sat above a small cesspit lined with a well-fed green slime. They were often used.
;Common Refectory
:Beyond the privies and behind the back stairs, in the southeast corner, was the common refectory. This plain dining hall was only used for everyday meals by the clergy. It held two almost {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} oak tables that could 24 people each. For illumination, there were several small ''driftglobes'' over the tables; a regular mealtime game was hit them between the tables. This refectory was usually unused outside mealtimes, and guard patrols only checked in once or twice an hour.
;Grand Stair
:East of the nave, behind the arch, was a grandiose staircase (#13) that connected each of the temple's four floors with its swooping curves. Reserved for high-ranking priests during rituals and social occasions, it seemed purpose-designed for the Priestess of the High Moonlight, with the Twelve walking behind her, to make a dramatic entrance under glimmering moon beams, and a sight recommend to many a visitor to Waterdeep.
:Possibly for the same reason, the stairway lacked a banister. For safety, should anyone fall, jump, or be pushed, a permanent ''[[feather fall]]'' spell was active in the area, carrying them safely to the floor. For fun, spirited young priestesses sometimes leapt from the stair, which probably led petticoats being adopted as part of their vestments.
;Back Stairs
:Behind the Grand Stair, and linked to it via a nearby door, were the back stairs (#20). Intended for everyday use, these two sets of curving stone steps were well worn by frequent use, even from priests' slippers and it was almost inevitable to have to pass another person in the stairway. Guard patrols up and down these were rare, as they were usually assigned to only one level. From the back stairs, a corridor led to the common refectory and privies.

===Second Floor===
[[File:HotM-2ndFloor.png|thumb|510px|right|''A plan of the second floor.'']]
;Minstrel's Gallery
:Surrounding the entrance hall and narthex from the balconies, the minstrels' gallery was where harpists wandered and played gentle tunes for visitors below all through the days and evenings, and their melody permeated the whole temple. The gallery was often filled with music and laughter—if one could overlook the discreet murder holes in the floors. The low railing let people observe events below. All along the walls were tapestries and artworks both ornate and valuable. Guards patrolled the gallery regularly at nights.
;Narthex Cantoria
:Off the gallery in the west, overlooking the narthex, the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantoria cantoria] was where the choir assembled and sang, often for audiences of nobles in the narthex. When not used for concerts, the area was used to display white marble statues donated by the [[Moonstar]] and [[Tchazzam]] noble families.
;Bethel
:Opposite the cantoria and behind the Crow's Nest part of gallery, the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bethel bethel] was a small chapel catering specifically to sailors. In the northeast corner, a small dais supported an altar bearing a simple silver offering bowl, also linked by ''Blaenther's bowls'' to the cimeliarch. All four walls were painted with a mural of a calm sea under a shining moon. The rear door led to the hall of ships.
:It was a tradition of Waterdhavian seafarers to pray in the bethel before departing [[Deepwater Harbor]], so that the Moonmaiden would guide them home again. Seafarers typically tossed their last [[copper piece]] into the offering bowl, made a short and silent prayer, and finally sprinkled a few drops of seawater on the altar. Most, if not all, of a ship's crew could come through here.
[[File:House of the Moon - side.jpg|thumb|right|''A side view of temple, showing the tower domes. Vajra has no trouble getting in and out with Luna's guidance.'']]
;East and West Tower Domes
:In the northern corners of the gallery, doors led into the domed upper levels of the central guard towers. These were attic spaces inside the nearly {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes|adj=high}} elongated domes that surmounted the towers. In each dome, three arrow slits overlooked the area outside the temple and twelve small crescent-shaped windows around the apex admitted light. Trap doors led down to the lower levels of the towers.
:The east tower dome (#22) was typically used for weapons practice, and practice weapons were hung on the walls for this purpose. There were usually two or three off-duty priests training here during daytime and evening. The west tower dome (#21) was used as an armory, and the walls were lined with moonpoles and other pole arms, the [[moon's hand]] maces favored by the faith, and [[shield]]s, while stacked crates contained [[chain mail]] jerkins. The door to this armory was kept locked.
;Triforium
:Overlooking the nave and altar of the Church of the Moon and Stars were the seven arched balconies of the [[Wikipedia:triforium|triforium]] (#28). The southern balconies were also called the Moon Cantoria, as the temple choir sang from these during services. The others held excess worshipers when there was no space left on the pews during the more popular services. Owing to its placement, the whole gallery saw many people coming and going at all hours and they customarily stayed quiet and spoke softly to avoid disturbing the church beneath.
;Hall of Ships
:At the triforium's northeastern end was the hall of ships (#26), wherein were displayed detailed and splendid models of famous Waterdhavian vessels, particularly from its early maritime history. These included the ''[[Pride of Ahghairon]]'' and the ''[[Sea of Shilarn]]'', and the most recent as of 1370 DR was the ''[[Kiss of the Moon]]'', though it had sunk half a century earlier. The display was popular with Waterdhavian mariners, and it was viewed with quiet reverence. Otherwise, it saw only infrequent visitors, priests, and guard patrols, but all paused to appreciate the models.
;Sacristy
:Beside the hall of ships was a sacristy (#27), in which were kept vestments and altar vessels used in the Chapels of the Waxing and Waning Moons, the bethel, and the Church of the Moon and Stars. It was understandably busy before and after services.
;Cimeliarch
:Past the Grand Stair (#13) and back stairs (#20, in the southeast corner was the [https://www.wordnik.com/words/cimeliarch cimeliarch] (#29).<ref group="note">''Powers & Pantheons'' consistently misspells this as "cimeliarach". This article uses the correct spelling "cimeliarch". This was the main treasury of the temple, holding its money, donations, other valuables, and holy relics that weren't on display. Only the highest-ranked priests knew exactly what these were. One may have been Shar's own ''[[Rod of Oblivion]]'', recovered after her battle with Selûne in the Time of Troubles.
:The chamber was magically warded and the single door was locked and trapped both mechanically and magically. Moreover, it was guarded from within by a [[watchghost]]—only Naneatha knew their identity and history—and a [[clay golem]] made by Naneatha. Guard patrols regularly checked the door was secure, but did not try to enter.
:The cimeliarch held a large silver offering bowl that received the donations placed into the counterpart bowls in the Chapels of the Waxing and Waning Moons and the bethel via the ''Blaenther's bowls'' spell. This worked in reverse too: items placed in the cimeliarch bowl could be teleported to the other bowls with but a thought, only Naneatha and the senior priests were aware of this, and they were only ones who came in, and only rarely.
;Sojourner's Portal
:Outside the cimeliarch door, at the end of the short corridor, there stood the magical [[mirror]] known as the ''[[Sojourner's Portal]]''. This ovoid, silver-framed mirror seemed unremarkable and antique, but it could show how a viewer saw themselves and even open ''[[gate]]s'' to other places, particularly holy sites of Selûne. The secret of its use was only known by Naneatha and a few of her closest advisors, but she was reconsidering it as a security risk.
;Dormitory of the Called
:Against the south wall, behind the triforium, was a dormitory (#31) where lived the aspirants and acolytes. With space for 32 people, there was a row of bunks interspersed by chests for personal effects and separated by thin curtains for privacy. The furnishings were austere. Although typically fully assigned, it was never full, as many were away on duties, even at nights. There would be only half a dozen people relaxing here during the day, and more than sleeping here at night. It had a door at each end.
;Conversation Chamber
:In the southwest corner was an area (#32) used as a lounge, with comfortable chairs and benches spread around and it was open to the triforium. Here, priests sat, read, talked quietly and informally, and played all kinds of games, commonly [[lanceboard]], though gambling was forbidden. There was an unwritten rule that priests left their relative ranks outside. There were usually ten to twenty off-duty priests here at any one time, except during services and late at night, and guard patrols tended to linger here to socialize, though they'd claim to be checking there were no misdeeds.
;Western Cells
:By the western wall, off the triforium, were three chambers (#33) that housed the junior, mid-ranked priests, with six to twelve to a room, though they were often empty as these priests were occupied elsewhere and guards checked in once an hour. The rooms were slightly more decorated than the dormitories.
;Bestiary of Lycos
:Finally, at the southwest end of the triforium, was the Bestiary of Lycos (#34). An open area, it was adorned with a number of tapestries showing werecreatures using their powers for the good of all. A legend held that any lycanthrope who went to sleep by the west wall would wake up with the ability to control their shifting for the next day. But while guards and others came through here regularly to cross between the triforium and minstrel's gallery, lycanthropes were much less common.

===Third Floor===
[[File:HotM-3rdFloor.png|thumb|270px|right|''A plan of the third floor.'']]
[[File:Eye of Selûne mirror.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''The ''Eye of Selûne'' in use.'']]
;Hall of Wind and Waves
:The third floor was dominated by the Hall of Wind and Waves. It had a cruciform shape; the long main hall led to the Great Library in the north and the Chapel of Eternal Hope in the south, while the transept connected to Grand Stair (#13) in the east and the enormous scrying mirror known as the ''[[Eye of Selûne (mirror)|Eye of Selûne]]'' in the west. The hall was considered among the most fantastic sites in the city, but usually only Selûnites, nobles, researchers and sailors got to see it.
:At the center, where the main hall and transept intersected, there was set in the floor a {{SIAdj|15|ft|long=yes|adj=wide}} crystal disk that served as a window on the Church of the Moon and Stars, though from below it was disguised by a ''[[permanent illusion]]''. A matching disk in the ceiling gave a view of the Hall of Ascendance on the fourth floor and ultimately the roof.
:But most amazingly, anyone who strode from the center of the crystal disk to the doors of the Great Library would be subjected to a stunning [[illusion]], experiencing all the sensations of being on the deck of a sleek Waterdhavian raker as it sailed a strange sea in strong winds under a moonlit night. They felt waves batter the deck, winds howl and buffet them, and even glimpsed [[dragon]]s flying overhead and mighty sea creatures break the surface at the horizon. To make it complete, an ''[[emotion]]'' spell instilled real excitement but also absolute solitude, even if walking alongside another. Even veteran mariners vowed there was no more thrilling experience than a walk down the Hall of Wind and Waves. While a ''[[dispel magic]]'' or the like would delay it for a minute, nothing short of a well-worded ''[[wish]]'' would halt it forever.
;Great Library
:Lying at the northern end, the Great Library of the House of the Moon was considered one of the preeminent places of learning in Waterdeep, ranking among the [[Font of Knowledge]], the [[House of Wonder]], [[New Olamn]], and the [[Tower of the Order]]. It held significant works on [[astrology]], [[astronomy]], cartography, lycanthropy, navigation, and maritime lore. Also part of the library were the contents of the Hall of Maps and Hall of Exploration, but these lay in separate adjoining rooms.
:Tall bookshelves lined three walls and stood in rows across the chamber, all filled with [[book]]s from bottom to top. To reach the highest shelves, anyone inside the room could simply ''[[levitate]]'' up and down at will, though moving side to side required grasping the shelves or books themselves and pulling oneself along, but some frowned upon this. It was common to see distracted researchers reading in midair, and even bumping into one another. Four pillars supported the roof and ''continual light'' spells cast on these and the ceiling provided a soft blue-white illumination. Apart from useful [[cantrip]]s like ''[[copy]]'', ''[[write]]'', and ''[[read magic]]'' and others, other use of magic was prohibited. This was probably on account of a spontaneous duel between [[Kelvar Helmfast]] and [[Lorngar Roaringhorn]] in the late 1330s DR; they did substantial damage to the library, for which their respective families made reparations at many times the cost of the damage. By 1370 DR, the curators still talked of the time when the mages [[Tessalar Hulicorm]] and [[Maaril]] of the [[Dragon Tower]] had a staring contest that lasted through the afternoon and evening and only ended at moonrise, and feared what devastation their magic might have wrought.
:The librarians and curators were eight aged priests, and two to four could be found on duty at a time. They did not appreciate guard patrols clanking about, so the guards usually only looked through the door briefly. Researchers were often wizards, rangers, bards, and ship's captains; ten to thirty of them could be found here at all hours of day and night. Any stories of a [[mimic]] or [[peltast]] hiding in the library were entirely fictional.
;Hall of Maps
:Southwest of the Great Library, the Hall of Maps (#36) archived a wide range of [[map]]s of almost all the realms and cities of Faerûn and a precious few of the other continents, namely the [[Hordelands]], [[Kara-Tur]], [[Zakhara]], and [[Maztica]], though [[Eltabbar]], [[Evermeet]], and [[Neverwinter]] were significance absences. These maps were stored in ornate [[scrollcase|scroll tubes]] fashioned of [[bone]] and [[ivory]], placed lengthwise on the shelves. These tubes were actually unlabeled, and only the curators with their excellent memories and a shared ''[[necklace of memory enhancement]]'' were able to find a specific map. Their system wasn't perfect—they tended to "forget" where a map was stored if it displayed sensitive information and the one seeking it seemed suspect. The room saw six to eight researchers and guard patrols were also only occasional and discreet.
;Hall of Exploration
:Past this, the Hall of Exploration (#37) was a maritime museum, displaying on its shelves navigational instruments such as [[compass]]es on [[Wikipedia:binnacle|binnacles]], [[barometer]]s on [[Wikipedia:gimbal|gimbals]], [[Wikipedia:clinometer|clinometers]], [[sextant]], and [[Wikipedia:pelorus (instrument)|peloruses]]. There were also treasures brought back by famous explorers on display in ''glassteel'' cases, including the ''[[Hauberk of Sossal]]'' found by [[Dabron Sashenstar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in [[1357 DR]].
:Regardless, it was usually used as a reading room when there wasn't space in the Great Library. It usually had four to six researchers and typically acolytes using this room for their studies. Guard patrols checked in more often.
;Cells of Selûne
:On the eastern side were two rows of cells (#39B–L), eleven in all, used as quarters by senior priests. These small, square chambers varied according to their occupant but usually had simple but elegant, comfortable, and well-made furnishings, including a small bed and thick mattress, a wardrobe, a locked chest for personal possessions, a chamber pot, and thick carpeting and tapestries.
[[File:House of the Moon - cell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Onyx and Timoth discovering Luna's "guest" quarters.'']]
;Chapel of Hidden Truths
:Off to the side, the larger of the cells (#39A) had special status. Once, it was set aside as quarters for special guests, but in the Time of Troubles, the goddess Selûne herself, as Luna, was kept captive here. Even so, it had bare stone walls and was sparsely furnished with wooden bed, desk, and bench. While an unwilling guest here, Luna drew the phases of the moon above the bed in [[chalk]] to mark off the days. Afterward, the penitent priests dedicated it to her as the Chapel of Hidden Truths. It held only a few prayer mats around a sparkling and shimmering sphere of moonlight hovering in midair by Selûne's will.
;Hall of Long Thoughts
:Looping around the cells was a bare corridor that came to be called the Hall of Long Thoughts. As busy Waterdeep had few places nearby for a quiet contemplative stroll, priests who desired to tended to walk up and down or around this corridor. Guard patrols here and in the cells were of course rare and quiet.
;Chapel of the Full Moon
:South of the Hall of Wind and Waves, the Chapel of the Full Moon (#41) was reserved for use by the clergy themselves. The semi-octagonal room was centered on a small dais and altar, around which were arranged concentric rings of pews, with an aisle down the middle. On the wall on either side were depictions of the waxing and waning moon. Reaching up to {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}, the ceiling was a hemispherical dome of ''glassteel'' glass; normally opaque, it would turn transparent when the moon was shining above it. Some {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} above the floor hovered "the Little Moon", a small moon almost {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} wide and drawing all eyes and attention to it. Several times it had emanated ''[[moonfire]]'' that washed over all the priests present.
:From here, doors led northwest to the western dormitories and northeast to the almariol.
;Almariol
:Northeast off the chapel, the [https://www.lexico.com/definition/almariol almariol] (#42) was a small chamber for storage of vestments, with more than sixty robes of a range of sizes and clerical ranks hanging from the wooden poles and pegs. It was quite crowded with them, and a good place to hide. A door led through to the garrison dormitory.
;Garrison of the Order of the Half Moon
:Accessed from the eastern transept, in the southeast corner, the garrison dormitory (#43–47) housed the off-duty Knights of the Half Moon, with the smaller rooms reserved for the commanders. Each room was furnished with bunk beds, chests for personal effects, and places for their armor and weapons. Also here were the back stairs (#20).
;Western Dorms & Privy
:Entered via the western transept or the northwest chapel door, the western dormitories (#49A–D) lay in the southwest corner of the building and were home to senior mid-rank priests, with four to six to a room. The rooms were a little better than those for the junior mid-ranked priests on the floor below, with sturdier beds and bunkbeds, comfortable mattresses, and paintings and tapestries adorning the walls.
:These rooms were usually empty, as the priests were often away on duties. Guards checked around here once an hour.
:Also here was a unisex privy (#48) for priests and visiting researchers alike. It sat above a small cesspit lined with a green slime.

===Fourth Floor===
[[File:HotM-4thFloor.png|thumb|270px|right|''A plan of the fourth floor.'']]
;Hall of Ascendance
:On the fourth floor, from the landing of the Grand Stair (#13), was the Hall of Ascendance (#50). The walls were covered with frescos illustrating Selûne's battles with Shar during the Time of Troubles, beginning with the first reports of conflict by the stair and advancing to her victory, fresh hope for peace, and the waxing moon for an uplifting theme. They subconsciously drew the eye upward to another flight of stairs that led up to the Dome of the Moon at the top of the building.
:Set in the floor before these stairs was another ''glassteel'' crystal disk, letting one look down through to the Church of the Moon and Stars. Similarly, the ceiling over the Grand Stair in the east was sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass.
:This area often had junior priests running errands, as well as guard patrols. Near the Grand Stair a door led to the back passageway.
;Chamber of the Shard
:West of the Hall of Ascendance, behind a curtain was a large chamber (#51) wherein was displayed the magnificent [[moonstone]] statue known as the ''[[Moonstone Shard]]''. Legend held that it would animate to defend the temple if it came under attack. The western part of the ceiling was sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass. Two Knights stood guard here constantly and patrols were frequent.
;Back Passageway
:The back passageway (#52) connected the Hall of Ascendance to the Hall of Learning, Moontable Room, and Antechamber, not to mention the privy, and it ran under the stairway leading up to the Dome of the Moon. The corridor was commonly used by lesser priests on errands and by guard patrols.
;Privy
:This was the personal privy (#53) of the Priestess of the High Moonlight. It too sat above a small cesspit lined with a green slime.
;Hall of Learning
:In the west, the Hall of Learning was used for teaching and training the clerics and silverstars alike. Religious instruction took place in the mornings, combat training occurred in the early afternoon, and advanced education was provided in late afternoons. The first two were compulsory and the last one was optional but popular among junior priests as a way to broaden the mind, at least when their duties allowed them to attend.
:This long hall under a sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass ceiling had space and benches to seat up to sixty students at a time. These were arranged in rows for lectures and moved to the walls to clear the floor for martial arts. For the latter, weaponry and shields in their hundreds adorned the walls. When in use, it usually held up to three senior priests as instructors and ten to thirty junior priests as students. Outside these times, guard patrols were frequent.
;Moontable Room
:In the center of this level, the Moontable Room (#55) served as the office for the Priestess of the High Moonlight, Naneatha Suaril, where she managed the everyday matters of the temple. In the course of a normal day, six or more priests would be present and many more couriers ran errands. And on occasion, the room would host negotiations between representatives of the city's most powerful factions, such as the [[:Category:Waterdhavian_houses|noble families]] and [[guild]]s, with the high priestess and her assistants working hard to mediate. More than once, centuries-long feuds had been resolved right in this room.
:The room was dominated and named for the massive round table, called the Table of the Moon, constructed of white marble and no less than {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} wide. Doors led to the back passageway, Hall of Learning, Grand Balcony, and Antechamber. Guard patrols didn't come by often, less than once an hour.
;Antechamber
:In the east was an antechamber (#56) leading to the high priestess's private quarters. Considered modest, this room was decorated with religious scenery and had an amazingly thick and soft carpet with piles of pillows, making it all very plush and comfortable. The ceiling continued the sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass and a number of ''driftglobes'' provided lighting.
:The antechamber was used only rarely by Naneatha to entertain guests in private. Its most common occupant was [[Lunapine]], a [[moon dog]] and her closest companion. Guard patrols checked in less than once an hour and only when Lunapine was not present in the temple, and only once a shift otherwise.
;Bathing Pool
:South of the antechamber was the private bath and pool (#58) of the high priestess. Made of white marble, it was several feet off the floor and sat under the sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass ceiling. Water was continuously supplied by a ''[[decanter of endless water]]'' built into the base of the pool. A secondary enchantment on the ''decanter'' allowed the water to be changed anywhere from freezing to boiling at but a touch. Dwarven-built plumbing drained the excess to the city's sewers.
;Private Quarters
:The antechamber led to the high priestess's private quarters (#57), with the eastern half under the sloping, transparent ''glassteeled'' glass ceiling. At the center of the room was a circular bed that not only hovered off the ground and moved up and down on command, but also slowly rotated. By the walls were the many wardrobes needed to store her extensive collection of fabulous dresses.
:Naneatha did little more than sleep and dress here, and only from midnight to dawn, as she spent much of the rest of her time engaged in temple administration and matters of faith. In her rare relaxation time, she liked to just lay on the bed and watch the moon and stars above. Guard patrols never came in, unless there was an emergency. During the Time of Troubles, Naneatha gave up this room to the supposed avatar of Selûne.
;Grand Balcony
:At the northern end, overlooking the main entrance and between the domed tower tops, was a grand open balcony (#59). From here, one had both glorious views over Waterdeep’s Sea Ward and of the mountains in the north and a place of peace and seclusion up above the hectic city life below, though it could get windy. Arranged several feet from the edge was a line of short footed pillars, each supporting a decorative marble urn. These were removed for some events such as galas, when they were used as makeshift drinks tables or stools.
:For security, such as if someone tried to fly in and land on the balcony, ''[[wall of moonlight|walls of moonlight]]'' would appear in an instant. Guard patrols came by often, ostensibly for keeping an eye on the surrounding streets, but more likely to take in the sights.

===Roof===
[[File:HotM-roof.png|thumb|250px|right|''The rooftop terrace and Dome of the Moon.'']]
;Rooftop Terrace
:Atop the central square-shaped section of the temple was a large square terrace. Enclosed by a low stone wall, its four corners were built of intricately interlocked tiles of white marble that were carved to represent the different lunar phases. In case anyone fell off the rooftop terrace, there was a permanent magical effect automatically bestowing ''feather fall'' to save them, unless they consciously resisted it.
:The priests maintained a small herd of [[asperii]], which were stabled on the northeast terrace, though they were often left to gallop freely through the sky over the city.
;Dome of the Moon
:Within the rooftop terrace stood the majestic Dome of the Moon (#60), the pinnacle of the temple in the late 14{{th}} century DR and a glowing beacon on the city skyline. It could be accessed via the stairway from the Hall of Ascendance below. The hemispherical dome was made of multiple ''wall of moonlight'' spells, overlapped and combined with a number of carefully worded ''wish'' spells, giving it the appearance of a shimmering pearly white curtain of swirling force. While normally any matter could pass through, the high priestess and the goddess could both will it to become an impenetrable ''wall of force'' or make it disappear completely.
:Inside was a garden, making the dome something of a greenhouse. Many Waterdhavian religious structures had their own gardens and greenhouses like this, but the Moongarden was unique: all of its plants were native not to [[Toril]], but to the [[moon]]. To preserve these moon plants, the interior was kept cold—it rarely got above {{SI|60|F}}—and so the dome was only removed on cool nights in the spring, summer, and autumn, and only for an instant at other times. It was a sensitive ecosystem and replacing dying plants required a covert expedition to the moon to collect healthy specimens under the gaze of the paranoid Selûnians.
:The garden was traversed by pebbled paths and tended to by several horticulturists. Guard patrols came only rarely, to avoid causing a disturbance. Ceremonies were conducted at the heart of the garden on nights of the full moon, after which the faithful passed time in privacy in secluded parts. Curiously, some people insisted the dome was bigger on the inside than it was on the outside and some visitors were known to get lost in the garden for hours looking for the stairs and, ultimately, the privy.
[[File:House of the Moon - detailed.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A closer view of the domes and towers. Inset: Interior of the cupola.'']]
;Cupola
:Originally, atop the dome stood a [[Wikipedia:cupola|cupola or lanterna]], one big enough to serve as another tower. The interior was well furnished, with an elegant ''chaise longue'' and an artistic urn. During the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, the false avatar of Selûne based herself here.Although this structure is prominent and the interior and exterior are both depicted in the comics ''Selune Rising'' and ''Lunatics'', it is absent in the artwork in ''Powers & Pantheons'' and not mentioned in text. While this may just be artistic variation, it is included here to explain the scene set there and the obvious discrepancy. Otherwise, this article overlooks the differences between the depictions. being replaced with a large crescent moon as on the other domes.

===Cellars & Crypts===
Below the temple was a vast and complex network of subterranean constructions, which could be entered only via the back stairs at the ground floor. It included wine cellars, armories, and other storage chambers, as well as many burial vaults, not to mention the tunnels to connect them all. These chambers were protected by various magical guardians. There was also a link to the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|city's sewer system]], in the branch accessed though the surface shaft at the intersection of [[Sharra's Flight]] and the [[Street of Whispers]], and another to the vaults beneath the former High House of Stars.

==Activities==
The House of the Moon was a busy place, where people not only worshiped but also socialized, received education, did business, and planned journeys and expeditions. In the library and map room, merchants and ships' captains researched new routes and guides, hunters, and [[adventurer]]s looked for forgotten trails through untraversable terrains like the [[Spine of the World]]. Scions of the Waterdhavian nobility received lessons from the strict priests and priestesses in the afternoons, while the nobles themselves attended grand balls in the splendid surrounds once a month—all for charity, of course. 

But for everyday ecclesiastical activities, the priesthood managed a constant flow of petitioners and [[pilgrim]]s, from early morning to late night. They offered donations, worshiped Selûne, and gazed upon the ''Wand of Four Moons''. On nights of the full moon, when it was visible and the sky was clear, worship took place on the rooftops, and more folk watched and prayed from Diamond Street below.

The annual temple holiday of [[Selûne's Hallowing]] celebrated the [[moon]], stars, and navigation. This was originally intended to reenact the purging of Malarites from the region in the {{YearlinkName|1090}}, but over the centuries other aspects took precedent and the ceremony evolved. Taking place in the month of [[Uktar]], at the peak of the full moon, it culminated in a parade of the faithful, which left the House of the Moon at moonrise and journeyed through the streets down to the harbor. The high priestess bore the replica ''Wand of Four Moons'' at the head of this parade. At the harbor, a ceremony was held to bless all navigators.

The temple also held a festival on the [[Feast of the Moon]].

===Relics===
The temple housed the original ''[[Wand of Four Moons]]'', the weapon of Selûne, by 1358 DR. It was stored in a large sky-blue case adorned with pale-yellow images of the lunar phases. This replica was created and blessed by Selûne herself to commemorate her battle with Shar in the city during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR. Identical in appearance, it levitated within a glass case before the altar in the Church of the Moon and Stars and radiated a soft, silvery-blue light. It had no other powers, but some lucky [[pilgrim]]s saw it drip [[Drops fallen from the moon|Selûne's essence]] or heard the goddess whisper inspiring or helpful words. When Selûne manifested in the temple, she emerged from this replica. It was said to contain some of her power. Selûnite pilgrims came to the temple to see this holy relic.

==History==
===Precursors===
One of Waterdeep's oldest faiths was the [[church of Selûne|worship of Selûne]], with Selûnites recorded to have worshiped on the side of [[Mount Waterdeep]] as early as the {{YearlinkName|390}}, before there even was a city. The first permanent shrine stood close to the harbor's edge; local legend held that the Selûne's Smile tavern was later built on its foundations.

Nevertheless, for several centuries, it was still but a minor cult, though it never faded away entirely. When [[Bloodhand Hold]] dominated the area ([[482 DR|482]]–[[882 DR]]), good Selûnite [[lycanthrope]]s formed the [[Cult of the Howling Moon]] and assembled in what was later known as the [[Dancing Court]] in [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|South Ward]].

In [[757 DR]], the ranking priestess of the area, Priestess of the High Moonlight [[Rian Liurandel]], was informed of the alleged heresy of the [[New Moon Pact]] by High Moonmistress [[Brima Chintamn]] of [[Bright Lady's Tower]] in distant [[Chancelgaunt]]. Rian agreed with the charges and condoned the destruction of the lycanthropic Pact.<ref group="note">The original text refers to both the House of the Moon and Waterdeep, neither of which existed by that name in 757 DR.

Though the cult (or specifically its shapechangers) was expelled by [[Nimoar|Nimoar the Reaver]] (reigned [[882 DR|882]]–[[936 DR]]), it later returned. Those faithful who stayed assembled in secret for more than a century, until after the [[Trollwars|Second Trollwar]] ended in [[952 DR]]. 

A small altar and chapel was dedicated to the goddess in the {{YearlinkName|985}}. It stood atop the [[Plinth|Plinth of the Moon and Stars]], a mage's tower owned by [[Lunaven Moonstar]] just north of Waterdeep. A quiet fellowship, the local Selûnites made it the center of their faith in the city for more than a century. After 50 years, it was enclosed by the walls of the growing city. Finally, during a Great Hunt in the [[1090 DR|Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR]], [[church of Malar|Malarites]] ambushed Lunaven on his return from [[Neverwinter]], killed him, and looted his magic, which they then used to sack and raze the Plinth on the night of a new moon, desecrating the Selûnite chapel as they went. Because of this blasphemy, three of Selûne's [[planetar]] servants, the [[Shards]], arrived outside the city walls and mustered the goddess's followers. After a fortnight, a pack of lycanthropes, over a hundred in number and led by the Shards, hunted down and slaughtered the Malarites and drove the survivors from the land. This "hunt of the hunters" was commemorated with reenactments in later years, ultimately becoming the Selûne's Hallowing procession.

In the aftermath, around the {{YearlinkName|1095}}, the Moonstars and Selûnites gave the Plinth to the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], after which it became a shrine to all small faiths in the city. In exchange, they received vacant land north of the city, for the immediate construction of a proper temple. Work on this project had started almost as soon as the Malarites had been defeated.

The [[High House of Stars]] was completed and worship commenced there in the {{YearlinkName|1097}}. With it, the faith flourished in Waterdeep. Lady [[Alathene Moonstar]], granddaughter of Lunaven, established the [[Maids of the Midnight Moon]], an order of Selûnite sorceresses, in the {{YearlinkName|1099}}. But some years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1104}}, her twin brother Lord [[Vanrak Moonstar]] blamed the priests of Selûne from the High House of Stars for their father [[Andvarren Moonstar|Andvarren's]] death and publicly split from the church. He later converted to the faith of [[Shar]], turned some of the Moonstars to his cult, and founded the [[Dark Army of the Night]]. Alathene and the still-faithful Moonstars took refuge in the High House of Stars before deposing Vanrak.

Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, the Dark Army of the Night infiltrated the High House of Stars, killed most of the priests, looted the vaults, and burnt it down. They even framed followers of [[Bane]] for the crime. Rising as matriarch of House Moonstar, Lady Alathene focused on building a new temple just west of the ruins.

===Early History===
The House of the Moon was opened for worship in the {{YearlinkName|1188}}. Over the next ten years, it renewed the faith and attracted many more followers from across the city. Lady Alathene meanwhile withdrew from active participation in the priesthood to continue her investigation of Lord Vanrak in secret from the High House of Stars ruins; the Selûnites called the site desecrated and forbade trespassing. Alathene later made an alliance between the House of the Moons and the [[drow]] followers of Eilistraee in Undermountain. Later, in the {{YearlinkName|1256}}, the House of the Moon's Priestess of the High Moonlight gave special dispensation to the Moonstars to build a new villa on the High House of Stars site.

In the years after, the Selûnites and Sharrans had only occasional minor conflicts, but no serious fighting. In one of the more significant episodes, following sectarian strife in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, between the local faiths of Selûne, Shar, [[Tempus]], and [[Lathander]], the House of the Moon became the target of another arson attempt by the Dark Army on the [[Night of Temple Fires]] but the Selûnite priests managed to thwart the attack.<ref> A fortnight after, the Selûnites retaliated, leading allied churches to attack a secret Sharran Temple below [[Shadows Alley]] in [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] and destroying more than a hundred [[shadow]]s.

===The Time of Troubles===
[[File:House of the Moon - far view.jpg|thumb|right|''Crowds of the faithful gathering outside the House of the Moon, hoping to see their goddess.'']][[File:House of the Moon - entrance.jpg|thumb|right|''At the main doors, the goddess is welcomed, as Naneatha and her guards stand by.'']]
One night during the [[Time of Troubles]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a purported [[avatar]] of Selûne arrived in Waterdeep and summoned the faithful to the House of the Moon. High priestess [[Naneatha Suaril]] was there to greet her, and temple guards assembled at the temple doors. The avatar promised the faithful her grace and protection. However, one did not believe her: [[Luna]]—the true avatar of Selûne—who'd come with her friend [[Vajra Valmeyjar|Vajra]] to see for herself. Vajra had already snuck in and out of the temple to find the ''[[Wand of the Four Moons]]'', but with no success. As the mob of worshipers and then the temple guards overwhelmed and subdued Vajra, Luna confronted the avatar and the two engaged in a battle of [[spell]]s on the steps of the temple. Finally, the priests gave the false avatar the ''Wand of the Four Moons'' and she used it to knock out Luna. The temple guards took Luna prisoner at the avatar's direction.{{Cite comic/Selune Rising}}<ref>

Uncertain of this supposed goddess, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] kept the temple under constant surveillance.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|8,24}} Her true identity unknown, Luna was kept as a "special guest"—prisoner—at the House of the Moon for a dozen days. The false Selûne had her completely under her control.{{Cite comic/Lunatics}} Learning of this, Luna's friends Vajra, [[Kyriani]], [[Onyx the Invincible|Onyx]], and [[Timoth Eyesbright|Timoth]] resolved to rescue her from the temple.

[[File:Hell hounds DC Comics.jpg|thumb|left|''Caught as spies, Timoth and Onyx are left to the hell hounds, which are probably not meant to be there either.'']]
Onyx and Timoth first infiltrated the temple to find Luna. The [[dwarf]] snuck in through a secret hole and a grating, and let the [[centaur]] through the main doors, and they overcame the Knights of the Half Moon on guard. After stealing their priestly robes, the pair tried to pass themselves off as new converts to [[Uton]] and another Knight, but they were skeptical. They found the room where Luna had been held, but she was gone. They were then confronted by Naneatha Suaril and the priests; not believing they were friends of Selûne, she accused them of being agents of [[Shar]], goddess of darkness and foe of Selûne, and she left [[hell hound]]s to deal with the intruders instead. Onyx and Timoth fought them off and escaped. Continuing on, they eavesdropped on Naneatha and the avatar, before they were ambushed by the [[Swords of the Lady|Lunatics]], elite but insane temple defenders. Smashing a window, the Lunatics took the fight outside, and battled Onyx, Timoth, Vajra, and Kyriani before the temple. The heroes unmasked one of Lunatics, expecting the dark goddess Shar but finding instead a brainwashed Luna!{{Cite comic/Lunatics}}

[[File:House of the Moon - silver dragon.jpg|thumb|right|''A shapechanged silver dragon outside the walls of the House of the Moon.'']]
Witnessing the battle outside, Naneatha began to question the false Selûne, who soon revealed her murderous intent. Learning that Luna was truly Selûne and that the false avatar was in fact Shar, Naneatha defiantly shoved her off the temple balcony, falling over herself. However, both were saved by Shar's ''[[featherfall]]'' spell. Shar took out her rage on Naneatha, hurling a ''[[meteor swarm]]''; Naneatha somehow diverted the spell, but not before both were knocked unconscious. Her near self-sacrifice bought time for Luna and her friends to escape the temple.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse}} It became a local legend of the faithful that during the Time of Troubles Selûne battled Shar in Waterdeep

Afterward, Naneatha had the House of the Moon reconsecrated and its damage repaired. New front gates were  installed and its defenses were enhanced.

===Recent History===
In the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, the clergy grew in strength. To atone for being tricked by Shar, Naneatha launched a crusade against Shar's followers, rooted out new Sharran cells, and drove them out of the city by [[1372 DR]]. Meanwhile, the Selûnites made renewed efforts to teach their faith. Naneatha also firmly supported the establishment of the [[Order of the Blue Moon]], dedicated to both Selûne and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]].

In the havoc of [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the magic of the ''Sojourner's Portal'' became warped, and the mirror unleashed a [[crimson death]] and three [[vampiric mist]]s from the depths of [[Undermountain]] into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped; the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers]] and was not seen again. Meanwhile, Naneatha was able to redirect the ''gate'', sending subsequent monsters—a [[sahuagin]] patrol, an [[ettin]], two [[trapper]]s, and a [[pyrohydra]]—into the crypts below Shar's [[Temple of Old Night]] in [[Calimport]]. In the year after, she reconsidered it might be a security risk.

The [[1370 DR|following year]], on learning his goddess [[Waukeen]] was held captive by [[Graz'zt]] in the [[Abyss]], Holycoin [[Tharundar Olehm]] at the [[Goldspires]] temple in [[Athkatla]], [[Amn]], alerted the leaders of other good faiths in [[Faerûn]], including the House of the Moon, who offered to help. Kyriani, already in Amn seeking [[Myth Lharast]], ''[[teleport]]ed'' the Holycoin's adventurers to the House of the Moon. Selûne herself wished to aid Waukeen, and so she'd permitted the ''Sojourner's Portal'' to take the adventurers to her own realm, the [[Gates of the Moon]], so that they might use the [[Infinite Staircase]] to reach the [[Abyss]]. Kyriani opened the portal for them.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the House of the Moon came to the aid of [[Khelben Arunsun]] when the newly arisen [[phaerimm]] threatened the safety of [[Evereska]]. Naneatha led a group of her Selûnite priests into battle at the [[High Moor]] to support the beleaguered [[elven]] soldiers on the ground.

==Members==
The [[Church of Selûne]] in Waterdeep was led by the Priestess of the High Moonlight, who in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR was [[Naneatha Suaril]]. Low-ranked priests were called acolytes and those in training to become resident priests were known as aspirants or the Called. Ordinary worshipers were often sailors and merchants, as well as wanderers and dreamers.

The temple was staffed with regular priests and priestessesIt's unclear where the hell hounds in the comic "[[Lunatics]]" came from, and whether they were briefly summoned with a spell or were permanent fixtures at the temple. It is also unknown why evil hell hounds are used at the temple of a good deity. It seems most likely they were brought there by the evil goddess Shar during her stay.

''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], the temple had around 120 priests, of which 50 or more were [[silverstar]]s, about 30 were aspirants, about 30 were [[cleric]]s (though these were declining), some were mystics, and the rest were [[crusader]]s of the [[Order of the Half Moon]] knighthood. More than 60% of the priests were female and the majority were [[human]], with small numbers of [[elves]] and [[half-elves]], [[lycanthrope]]s including a half-dozen [[werecat]]s, and a few [[tallfellow halfling]]s.This 240 number may count priests and lay worshipers, whereas the earlier 120 number only counts priests. with 153 humans, 24 half-elves, 24 werecats, 12 elves, 12 [[halfling]]s, 8 [[gnome]]s, and 7 of other races, mostly good lycanthropes. They were clerics, [[bard]]s, [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, and [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s. Senior members often became silverstars.

Members of the Order of the Blue Moon regularly attended the church in the early 1370s DR and made it their base of operations.

Joining the church required a demonstration of understanding of its teachings and a vow of devotion to Selûne. Though there was no fee to join, there were dues of 5 [[gp]] per month. Members were expected to follow the tenets of the faith and perform charity work among the needy, poor, or sick, for about 10 hours a [[tenday]].

The priests came from all kinds of backgrounds and from all levels of society, but their regular association with the noble class rubbed off on them with some self-importance. However, they remained tolerant and devout.

===Abilities===
Members practiced skills in diplomacy and understanding motive, healing, religious lore, and [[spell]]craft and concentration.

Those of strong faith and favored by the temple could receive a blessing from Selûne, saving them from harm for a minute, when under a moonlit sky between sunset and sunrise. Those who were afflicted lycanthropes could better resist changing shape.

Many spellcasting members were initiated into the magical secrets of the church and learned the arts of [[lunar magic]].

===Dress===
The House of the Moon was known to have the most grandiose ceremonial vestments of Selûne's church.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|137}} Naneatha Suaril presided over ceremonies in a majestic gold-hued dress with a wide-bottomed hooped skirt and a great fan-like collar ascending from the back of her neck, both stiffened with [[whale]]bone, all set with clusters of [[pearl]]s and precious stones. Such fine vestments were valued at 10 to 100 [[gp]] depending on their cleric ranks.

For armor, the temple guards wore [[chainmail]] vests and [[leggings]] with plate shoulder guards, armbands, bracers, breastplates, greaves, belts, and waist-guards, in silvery and golden hues. Their heads were protected by conical helms with chainmail neckguards. Helms, bracers, and waist-guards were adorned with a crescent moon symbol. With their armor, they wore red cloaks, but they could also don a priest's pale-blue robes over their armor. For weaponry, they carried unique polearms topped with crescent-moon blades,The description of the Knights of the Half Moon in ''Powers & Pantheons'' is undoubtedly based on the depiction of the priests in the comic "Lunatics", so they are assumed to be of the order.

The long-standing [[Moonstar (family)|Moonstar]] noble family had close ties with the Waterdhavian Church of Selûne, at both the House of the Moon and its predecessor the High House of Stars.<ref> But the church's greatest enemy was Lord [[Vanrak Moonstar]] and his [[Dark Army of the Night]], who worked to destroy the House of the Moon, the church as a whole, and Selûne herself.
