The Potala was the palace of the Dalai Lama in Saikhoi.
The Potala appeared as a red citadel. The entire compound covered 5 acres of lands and the building stood ten stories tall. The first three stories were solid stone. The next two stories had arrow slits. Square windows decorated the sixth, seventh, and eighth stories. The ninth and tenth stories were ringed by wooden balconies that overlooked the entire city.
In addition to the Dalai Lama, Princess Tsenya Bhrokiti and the sohei guards lived within the Potala.
All who entered the Potala were blindfolded and carefully escorted by the sohei through a series of secret tunnels and passages.
