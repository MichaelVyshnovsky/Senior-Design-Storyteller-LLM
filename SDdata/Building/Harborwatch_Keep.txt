'''Harborwatch Keep''' was the seat of power for [[Scardale]], located in the dale's capital of [[Scardale Town]]. It housed both Scardale's leadership as well as its appointed town watch.

==History==
The keep served as home for the leader of Scardale from the days of the [[Aumersair]] dynasty, including its final lord [[Lashan Aumersair]], to the dale's occupation under the provisional lord [[Myrian Beechwood]] until [[1370 DR]].

During the occupation, Harborwatch Keep also accommodated the dozens of ambassadors, advisers, and envoys from the nations of [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] and the city-states of [[Hillsfar]] and [[Zhentil Keep]], as well as representatives from the other dales within the [[Dalelands]]. 

Harborwatch Keep was abandoned as seat of government after the [[Shaking Plague]] decimated Scardale Town in 1370 DR. The town of [[Chandlerscross]] took this responsibility and the new government of Scardale was established there.
