The palace served as the hiding place of the Armory of Nedeheim, which was discovered by Prince Imnel Torlath in the , during the Ogre Wars, who returned it to Athkatla for storage and then to Esmeltaran once it was completed in . The Armory was sought-after by the Horned Mage, who led a brief invasion of Amn in the . Afterwards, the Armory was moved from Dahaundar to a secure location in Murann.\nAfter the fall of Amns monarchy in the 13 century, the palace was bought by a consortium of fifteen rich families from Athkatla, Crimmor, and Murann. Each family took private ownership of a part of the castle, but the Great Hall itself was taken by the Council of Six as a meeting room. It became an unwritten rule that no blood could be shed inside the castle, as it was believed that it was haunted by the ghosts of ancient kings who would strangle anyone who tried to do battle in their home.\nWhen the ogre magi Sothillis and Cyrvisnea attacked Esmeltaran in the Sothillisian War of the , they searched the city and the old palace for any signs of the Armory of Nedeheim. Although they didnt find the weapons, they did find records from the time of Imnel and beyond revealing the collection had been transferred to Murann, leading the invaders there next. Before Esmeltaran was recaptured by the Council Army in the , the ogre forces there discovered more clues indicating that the Armory had been hidden in the Underdark beneath Murann."
