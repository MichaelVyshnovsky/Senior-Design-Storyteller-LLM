        "mainbody": "'''Dahaundar''' was an urban castle and royal palace in the [[Amn]]ian city of [[Esmeltaran]].",
        "Location": "The palace was built near the southern end of Esmeltaran.",
        "History": "Dahaundar originally served as the royal palace of Amn, dating back to the foundation of Esmeltaran in the 6{{th}} century [[DR]]. The palace served as the hiding place of the [[Armory of Nedeheim]], which was discovered by Prince [[Imnel Torlath I|Imnel Torlath]] in the {{YearlinkName|479}}, during the [[Ogre Wars]], who returned it to [[Athkatla]] for storage and then to Esmeltaran once it was completed in {{YearlinkName|512}}. The Armory was sought-after by the [[Horned Mage]], who led a brief invasion of Amn in the {{YearlinkName|661}}. Afterwards, the Armory was moved from Dahaundar to a secure location in [[Murann]].\n\nAfter the fall of Amn's monarchy in the 13{{th}} century, the palace was bought by a consortium of fifteen rich families from Athkatla, [[Crimmor]], and Murann. Each family took private ownership of a part of the castle, but the Great Hall itself was taken by the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] as a meeting room. It became an unwritten rule that no blood could be shed inside the castle, as it was believed that it was haunted by the ghosts of ancient kings who would strangle anyone who tried to do battle in their home.\n\nWhen the [[ogre magi]] [[Sothillis]] and [[Cyrvisnea]] attacked Esmeltaran in the [[Sothillisian War]] of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, they searched the city and the old palace for any signs of the Armory of Nedeheim. Although they didn't find the weapons, they did find records from the time of Imnel and beyond revealing the collection had been transferred to Murann, leading the invaders there next. Before Esmeltaran was recaptured by the [[Council Army]] in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[ogre]] forces there discovered more clues indicating that the Armory had been hidden in the [[Underdark]] beneath Murann."
