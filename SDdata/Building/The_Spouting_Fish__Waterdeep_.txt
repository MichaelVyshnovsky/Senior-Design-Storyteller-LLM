The '''Spouting Fish''' was a popular tavern in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].<ref group="note">On p. 27 of ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]'', it is claimed that the tavern is located in the Dock Ward, but this is incompatible with all previous sources, as well as all maps of the city across all previous editions. For that reason, we assume that the location given in ''Dragon Heist'' is in error.

==Location==
The tavern was located on the east side of the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]], at the corner where it turned north after branching west from the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] at the [[Waymoot (Waterdeep)|Waymoot]]. Its popularity was largely due to its strategic location, which prompted many travelers entering the city from [[South Gate]] to stop there for a drink.

==Structure==
The tavern was characterized by a large water fountain shaped like an upright spouting fish. The large building had several floors built with a labyrinthine structure.

==Interior==
The interior of the Spouting Fish was brightly lit. All of the tavern's booths and benches, as well as the building's structural beams and posts were unpainted and, for that reason, very flammable. As a result of the fire hazard, two members of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] were hired to remain constantly on guard within the tavern.

The tavern's cellar contained an entrance to a surface shaft that led to a small junction in the Waterdhavian sewer system.

===Atmosphere===
{{fq
| text   = A bit like drinking in the thick of a street brawl.
| source = A patron of the Spouting Fish
| float  = 
| width  = 
}}
The Spouting Fish was notoriously noisy and boisterous.

==Services==
The tavern offered numerous drinks, including [[zzar]], [[wine]]s, and [[beer]]s. The food, which included roast fowl, sausages, and [[bread]], was heavily [[salt]]ed to induce patrons to consume more beverages.

Another reason for the tavern's popularity was intense advertising performed by street criers across the city.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} the sewer intersection that connected to the Spouting Fish's cellar was an access point to one of the [[Xanathar Guild]] hideouts. It was guarded by a [[gazer]].

==Inhabitants==
In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Spouting Fish was owned by the fearless [[human]] [[Janess Imristar]].
