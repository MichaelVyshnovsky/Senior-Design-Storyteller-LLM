The Shrine of Crossed Swords was a shrine of Tempus that was founded in Scardale Town in 1362 DR. 
After the second inter-dale war ended in 1356 DR, Scardale abruptly became home to an occupying force of soldiers from nations such as Cormyr and Sembia. The religious needs of the various garrisons were accommodated for by Battle Chaplain Ulara Axehaft, who founded the temple and helped it thrive where others had failed.
