The '''Lady's House''' was the temple of [[Tymora]] in the [[Cormyr]]ean city of [[Arabel]].

==Services==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the Lady's House was overseen by the overbearing High Hand of the Lady [[Darmos Lauthyr]].

==History==
The [[avatar]] of Tymora herself appeared at the temple the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. She led a group of her faithful against a [[cleric]] they declared a heretic, when he caused great destruction by inadvertently conjuring a ''[[fireball]]'' when attempting to use healing magic on a wounded soldier. 

Over time the temple was rebuilt and gained many followers due to the presence of the Luck Maiden. Priest Lauthyr became quite demanding during this time of increased popularity among the Arabellan citizens, doubling the fees the temple imposed upon its faithful and demanding lordship from King [[Azoun IV]].

==Inhabitants==
During the time of its increased popularity the temple boasted two dozen priests and over 300 Tymoran devotees.
