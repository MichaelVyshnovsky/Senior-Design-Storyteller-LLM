This unnamed bandit camp was a camp located at the southern end of the Mere of Dead Men along the Sword Coast.
The bandit camp was located near Fort Locke.
The camp was composed of tents and a small building, where the bandit leader lived. The camp was surrounded by wooden walls, while the building was built from straw, wood and stone.
The building was composed of several rooms and halls where experienced bandits lived. There were many weapons and valuables stored inside it.
The camp was inhabited with bandits, who captured the refugees. The Kalach-Cha couldve learned the location from Neeshka and go there to rescue the refugees, then deal with the leader.
