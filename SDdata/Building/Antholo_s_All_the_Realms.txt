'''Antholo's All the Realms''' was a map and chart shop in [[Delzimmer]], [[southeast Faerûn]], owned by [[Antholo Kraul]] ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|55-57}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 47: Doings in Delzimmer, Part 6}}

==Location==
Antholo's was located on [[Riuntle Street]] in Delzimmer, a crossroads town (before the {{YearlinkName|1385}}) located between the [[Great Rift]], the [[Eastern Shaar]], [[Luiren]], and the [[Forest of Amtar]].

==Structure==
The shop was an unremarkable store front among many on Riuntle Street.

==Services==
The maps and charts at Antholo's sold for 25 to 200 [[gold piece]]s. The more expensive ones were larger, newer, and/or in demand, but all were much more practical than decorative—showing the essential elements without much cluttering detail. Examples of his wares included copies of trade charts from [[Calimshan]], [[Tharsult]], and the [[Tashalar]], which were themselves mostly copied from more authoritative originals kept in [[monasteries]], royal libraries, and [[Candlekeep]].

==History==
Antholo's All the Realms closed sometime in late [[1371 DR|1371]] or early 1372 DR when Antholo Kraul died while walking by a three-story residence that mysteriously collapsed upon him and a few others, fatally crushing them. Three of his female cousins closed the shop and were in a petty argument over the division of his wares when Kraul walked into his shop like nothing was amiss, a scant few days after his identified body had been burned on a funeral pyre. This same scenario was repeated many times over the next few months, which made Kraul somewhat notorious about town, and his shop benefited from that notoriety.
