        "mainbody": "The '''Golden Tankard''' was the local tavern found in the village of [[Parnast]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was run by [[Raggnar Redtooth]], an amiable but unscrupulous asset of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].",
        "Description": "The tavern earned its name from a particular [[gold]]en ''[[tankard of plenty]]'' of [[dwarven]] origin found by its proprietor. Images of reveling [[dwarves]] and patterns of shocks of grain decorated the magical mug.",
        "Location": "It was situated on the south side of the village, just on the edge of the main square and central well.",
        "Services": "The Tankard offered mugs of [[ale]] and [[mead]], for 3 [[cp]] or 1 [[sp]] respectively, and hearty food like stewed [[cabbage]], [[black bread]], and [[sausage]]s. There were no beds available for rent at the tavern.\n\nLocals were served with no extra concern, but travelers were merely offered service and reports about their activities were given to a high-ranking Dragon Cult agent, Captain [[Othelstan]].",
        "History": "At some point in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} the Cult of the Dragon used the Golden Tankard as rallying point as they amassed a trove of wealth and riches stolen from various locales across the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Gundalin]], Parnast's local wheelwright was a regular at the Golden Tankard."
