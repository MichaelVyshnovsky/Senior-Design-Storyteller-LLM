        "mainbody": "he Golden Tankard was the local tavern found in the village of Parnast as of the late 15 century DR. It was run by Raggnar Redtooth, an amiable but unscrupulous asset of the Cult of the Dragon.\nThe tavern earned its name from a particular golden tankard of plenty of dwarven origin found by its proprietor. Images of reveling dwarves and patterns of shocks of grain decorated the magical mug.\nIt was situated on the south side of the village, just on the edge of the main square and central well.\nThe Tankard offered mugs of ale and mead, for 3 cp or 1 sp respectively, and hearty food like stewed cabbage, black bread, and sausages. There were no beds available for rent at the tavern.\nLocals were served with no extra concern, but travelers were merely offered service and reports about their activities were given to a high-ranking Dragon Cult agent, Captain Othelstan.\nAt some point in the 1480s DR, the Cult of the Dragon used the Golden Tankard as rallying point as they amassed a trove of wealth and riches stolen from various locales across the Sword Coast.\n* Gundalin, Parnasts local wheelwright was a regular at the Golden Tankard."
