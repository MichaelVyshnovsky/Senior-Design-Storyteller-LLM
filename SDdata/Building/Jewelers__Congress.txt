The Jewelers Congress was a guildhall in Daggerford that was shared by the local Jewelers Guild and the Whitesmiths Guild.
The guildhall was located at the junction of the Farmers Road and Dukes Way in central Daggerford.
The building resembled something of a massive vault, akin to this that could be found within the walls of a bank. Each of the buildings entryways were heavily reinforced and it well-guarded by both the local constables as well as the Daggerford militia.
In addition to being a meeting place for two guilds, the Jewelers Congress served as a holding area for gems and precious metals.
Guild members could store their valuables within the guildhall, for a small fee based on the inherent value of what was being safeguarded.
