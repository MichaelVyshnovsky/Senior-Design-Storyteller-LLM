The '''Weeping Unicorn''' was an [[inn]] and [[tavern]] in the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]], operating around [[1358 DR]].

It was a quiet and comfortable place located by the docks, and of good quality for moderate prices. It was oft-used to do business by villainous sorts.

The house rule was strictly "no fighting", which all patrons obeyed, as those who didn't tended to run into a [[cockatrice]]. Their petrified forms adorned the cellar.
