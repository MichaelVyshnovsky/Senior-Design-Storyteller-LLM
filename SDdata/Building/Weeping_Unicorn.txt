The Weeping Unicorn was an inn and tavern in the city of Calaunt in the Vast, operating around 1358 DR.
It was a quiet and comfortable place located by the docks, and of good quality for moderate prices. It was oft-used to do business by villainous sorts.
The house rule was strictly "no fighting", which all patrons obeyed, as those who didnt tended to run into a cockatrice. Their petrified forms adorned the cellar.
