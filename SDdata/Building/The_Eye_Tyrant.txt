'''The Eye Tyrant''' was a tavern in the [[Amn]]ian city of [[Esmeltaran]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The tavern was built in almost the center of Esmeltaran.

==Services==
The Eye Tyrant catered specifically to off-duty guards and bouncers, and refused to admit the typical tourists and resort-goers that came to Esmeltaran. It was an expensive place to visit, but provided good service for the money.
