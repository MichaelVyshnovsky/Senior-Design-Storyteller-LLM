The Eye Tyrant was a tavern in the Amnian city of Esmeltaran during the 14 century DR.
The tavern was built in almost the center of Esmeltaran.
The Eye Tyrant catered specifically to off-duty guards and bouncers, and refused to admit the typical tourists and resort-goers that came to Esmeltaran. It was an expensive place to visit, but provided good service for the money.
