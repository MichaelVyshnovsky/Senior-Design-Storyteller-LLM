'''Bristle and Brettons''' was a tailor's shop located in the sleepy hamlet of [[Longsaddle]] of the [[Savage Frontier]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{HAT-time}}

==Services==
Bristle and Brettons offered a wide variety of clothing, finery, and costumes for balls and masquerades. The shop's interior consisted of rows of fanciful, colorful, glittering fabrics wrapped around cloth dummies and tailored suits on display. Decorative hats and headwear of various sizes were hung high on the shop's walls.

==History==
The shop was open in the late 15{{th}} century DR and was owned by [[Bristle]] – a tawny-furred [[tabaxi]] woman, and [[Brettons]] – a stout pudgy balding [[human]] male. Over the years, Brettons became acquainted with a charismatic con man and a [[rogue]] named [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], the relationship that brought the rogue and his accomplices, [[Kira]] and [[Edgin Darvis]], to the tailor's shop in search of finery to wear to a grand masquerade ball at the [[West Caraway Acres]] in [[Neverwinter]]'s countryside. The group was able to find costumes for the entire thieves' crew, along with masques to wear as part of the outfits.
