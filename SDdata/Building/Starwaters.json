        "mainbody": "Starwaters was a manor house located in the Tentowers neighborhood, within the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff. During the 14 century DR, it served as home to the noble Sinaran family of elves.\nThe estate featured a large, open-air central courtyard, complete with a reflecting pool, which was accessible by means of sliding doors. Trees were planted within the cellar of Starwaters and grew forth into the courtyard.\nThe entrance to the manor grounds was framed by sculpted silvergilt trees that had been magically enchanted to ensnare when so commanded by the manors residents. As such, thieves and elf-hating residents of the Bluff were no problem for the Sinaran family."
