        "mainbody": "'''Starwaters''' was a manor house located in the [[Tentowers]] neighborhood, within the [[Uptown District (Ravens Bluff)|Uptown District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], it served as home to the noble [[Sinaran]] family of [[elves]].",
        "Description": "The estate featured a large, open-air central courtyard, complete with a reflecting pool, which was accessible by means of sliding doors. Trees were planted within the cellar of Starwaters and grew forth into the courtyard.\n\nThe entrance to the manor grounds was framed by sculpted [[silvergilt]] trees that had been [[magic]]ally [[Enchantment|enchanted]] to ensnare when so commanded by the manor's residents. As such, [[thieves]] and elf-hating residents of the Bluff were no problem for the Sinaran family."
