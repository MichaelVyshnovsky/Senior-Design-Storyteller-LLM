        "mainbody": "The Caskhouse was the guildhall of the Brewers and Cheesemakers Guild in the city of Suzail, the capital of Cormyr.\nThe Caskhouse was located above the the High Tankard tavern that the guild owned, known as the Witch-Dukes Bride in the late 15 century DR. The guildhall occupied a single floor, the second floor of that building that faced the Promenade.\nThe Caskhouse was known to host long celebrations and revels filled with drinking that stretched into day-long events, open to the guild members and their guests. Some of the revels stretched into several days-long occasions that involved highcoin girls, exotic sweet treats, and retching buckets. The guildhall served only ales and massive platters of cheeses. Under Old Bucks management, the Caskhouse gained the love of the Suzails citizens for regular and spontaneous \"processions\" of the guilds servers, who gave out free samples of brews and exotic cheeses fermented and imported by the guild. In the winter months, the Caskhouse had an arrangement with the city guard to bring the starving poor and beggars from the freezing streets to the guild house where they were given \"warm-up\" meals of cheese and beer, then given free cloaks and sacks of of cheese-ends to take with them as they left.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Caskhouse and the guild were under the control of Oldvruk \"Old Buck\" Faerahowe, a jovial and sharp-tongued mountainous human man."
