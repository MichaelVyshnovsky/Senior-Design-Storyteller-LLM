        "mainbody": "The '''Weeping Garden''' was a place in [[Martyrdom]], the [[divine realm]] of [[Ilmater]] in the [[House of the Triad]]. It was the Crying God's private garden, which he shared with his most dedicated followers to provide relief and aid in their darkest moments.<ref group=\"note\">The Weeping Garden is only stated to be in the House of the Triad. This article presumes it lies in Ilmater's realm in that plane as well.",
        "Access": "Only Ilmater permitted entry to his Weeping Garden, and he allowed only a select and faithful few, those who demonstrated supreme dedication and selflessness in his name and were themselves in great need of relief. Such people were priests, knights, monks, or other devout worshipers of Ilmater, and they had to be caught in a crisis or grim situation, such as facing overwhelming odds or too many people in need of help. Some examples were defending helpless people against an enormous force, or helping victims of a plague to the point of exhaustion and loss of magic and resources, standing up against powerful followers of [[Loviatar]], or traveling the length and breath of [[Faer√ªn]] on a kind and just quest, all without regard for danger or self-advancement. At such rare times, Ilmater provided these selfless souls with relief and sanctuary in the Garden, though ultimately no release from their task.\n\nFor these blessed Ilmatari, to be invited into the Weeping Garden was a tremendous honor as well a great responsibility. Ilmater did not choose them at whim or by chance, and no one was ever chosen twice.\n\nThe companions of the chosen Ilmatari were allowed into the Weeping Garden with them, even if they themselves did not worship Ilmater, as Ilmater rarely separated his faithful from their allies. But, in most cases, the group as a whole had to have performed good deeds in aid of the chosen Ilmatari. If one among their number was deemed unworthy, however, then none of them were invited, including the Ilmatari. If, while in the garden, anyone offended Ilmater's faith by deed or spell, then the entire band would be instantly expelled.",
        "Description": "Entry and invitation to the garden was provided by a temporary ''[[portal]]'' appearing beside the chosen one. This could occur anywhere, whatever the environment, no matter how hazardous, whether a dank swamp, a perilous mountain path, or deep in the [[Underdark]]. The ''portal'' appeared as a regular garden path leading through a hedge-arch before disappearing into a thick mist that glowed with warm, inviting light, as if from an afternoon sun. The group had the free choice to step through or not. Once one of them did, they were soon transported to the garden.\n\nUpon arrival, visitors instantly knew the garden was a place of safety, that all was right and well with the place, and that this side-trip was for the greater good. The Weeping Garden was a place of pure serenity and soothing and it seemed perfect and peaceful. It lay under a perpetual sunny day with cloudless blue skies, but the temperate was mild and the light was not harsh. A gentle breeze softly rustled the leaves.\n\nThe garden was square, about 75 feet (23 meters) to a side, and bordered by a thick, 10-foot-high (3 meters) hedge. At the center of each side, in the directions of the four compass points, was a hedge-arch forming an entrance or exit, filled with the same thick, impenetrable mist as the ''portal''. Peering over the hedge would show an endless mist beyond, giving the impression of sitting atop a mountain peak above the clouds.\n\nCrossing the grassy ground and linking the four gates was a path of soft, loamy soil, leading to a ring of statues and a fountain in the center. The Statues of Lamentation were of white blue-veined [[marble]] and depicted [[human]]s, that is, common folk in plain clothes, four female and four male, with genders alternating at the compass directions. Each wept genuine tears that ran down the faces and splashed into the path. Between the statues was a plain pool and fountain that sprayed upwards with pure, sweet water that quenched anyone's thirst.\n\nIn each corner of the garden was a [[fruit]] tree, large and hale. Rather than a single kind of fruit or tree, however, these produced any and every kind of fruit that the guests might desire. Thus, they appeared as a veritable cornucopia, overloaded with myriad fruits, that would provide a healthy meal.",
        "Effects": "Anyone who both ate the fruit of the trees and drank the water of the fountain gained the benefits of a ''[[heroes' feast]]'' spell: for half a day, they were cured of all sickness and [[disease]], were immune to all [[poison]], were made healthy, their morale improved, and were made fearless. Partaking only of water or fruit left one with the understanding that both must be consumed for them to gain the full benefit.\n\nFor as long as the guests stayed within the garden, all their magic and abilities were enhanced, especially for devotees of Ilmater, provided such magic or abilities were in accordance with Ilmater's faith.\n\nOnce they were ready to leave via the gateways, the guests were blessed with a ''[[greater heroism]]'' spell. Again, they were made more healthy, their morale improved further, and they were also made fearless, as well made resistant to many [[spell]]s. This also lasted half a day.\n\nUpon returning to their place of origin, they found that time had passed differently in the Weeping Garden than on the [[Material Plane]]. It was a timeless place: no matter how long they stayed, not a moment passed where they had been before.",
        "Leaving": "However they left, the ''portal'' deposited the guests right back where they had been before, and at the same time. This would leave them in the exact same peril or crisis as they had been in previously, though now at least they were well rested, rejuvenated, and strengthened for the task ahead. The ''portal'' disappeared behind them.\n\nThose who survived their subsequent ordeal always remembered the Weeping Garden. But a sense of privacy surrounded their memories, and they would not openly speak of it, except quietly to close companions.",
        "History": "The history of the Weeping Garden was little known, for only Ilmater knew how long he had been allowing his chosen few to step inside, and those who visited the garden rarely spoke of it. Moreover, barely anything was known for certain, except that the garden lay in the House of the Triad and that Ilmater permitted entry.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "According to legend, on very rare occasions, the gates out of the garden did not return guests to their original location. Instead, they cleared of mists and led out into the wider plane of the House of the Triad. However, these claims were not verified by any who'd been to the Garden and spoken of it."
