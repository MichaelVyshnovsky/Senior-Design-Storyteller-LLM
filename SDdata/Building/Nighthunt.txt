The Nighthunt was an inn to the east of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The inn was located ones day ride east of Loudwater, on the southern side of the Dawn Pass Trail to Llorkh, near the South Wood.
The Nighthunt was a sprawling wooden lodge of low height embraced by pine and maple trees. Many spells were cast on it to prevent fires breaking out.
It was a rather quiet and comfortable establishment. Although not famous, it was favored by local adventurers, hunters, and even outlaws in hiding, as well as Harpers and enemies of the Zhentarim, of whom the innkeeper was a vocal critic.
Around  to 1370 DR, it was run by Ildur Arntar, a former ranger.
There was a local tale of a ghostly boar hunt being sighted on some nights, which would run into the South Wood. This was the source of the inns name, the Nighthunt.
