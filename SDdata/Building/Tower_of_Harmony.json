        "mainbody": "The Tower of Harmony was located atop Mount Kus in the Hordelands near Kushk.\nThe Tower was constructed on the site where the six roads leading up from the Holy Mountain of Kus converged. Each road actually led to a different floor of the Tower. Though it was a simple structure made from red stone, the Tower of Harmony was considered to be a place of perfect enlightenment.\nThe High Lama of Bimasara lived within the Tower of Harmony. He met with priests who were wise enough to master the dangerous tests within the Holy Mountain below."
