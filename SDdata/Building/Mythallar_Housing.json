        "mainbody": "The '''Mythallar Housing''' was the complex that contained the twin ''[[mythallar]]s'' of the [[Eileanar]] [[enclave]].",
        "Location": "The Housing was found near the center of the enclave, close to the [[University of Definitive Archwizardry]].",
        "Structure": "The ''mythallars'' were surrounded by a metal cage-like building that allowed their glow to be seen from outside. Mirrors were placed above the enclosure and reflected stray upward-flowing magical energy down and back into the enclave so that it wouldn't be wasted.",
        "Activities": "The enclave was one of the first enclaves to have two separate ''mythallars'' sustaining it. One ''mythallar'' was used for powering the many [[quasimagical item]]s in the enclave, while the other powered all the other magical effects that allowed for the enclave's gravity-defying architecture and high standards of luxury.\n\nThe Housing was overseen by [[Karsus]]'s trusted assistants, [[Dewez]], [[Haym]], and [[Salix]], who each took different work shifts. They were then assisted by [[Cowper]] whenever necessary.\n\n[[Laws of Karsus Enclave|Formal execution]] via contact with the ''mythallar'' was a known, though extreme punishment in the enclave. While other lethal executions often came with the allowance that the criminal could be ''[[resurrection|resurrected]]'' after a period of decades or centuries, destruction via ''mythallar'' was so complete that ''resurrection'' was impossible.",
        "History": "One notable execution via ''mythallar'' was around {{yearlinkConvert|3365|NY}}, that of Lord High Justice [[Andoris Derathar]]'s son, [[Jelal Derathar]], who was charged with the murder of an [[arcanist]]'s [[familiar]]. So confident in his innocence and the love of his father, Jelal daringly chose the ''mythallar'' over other potential means of execution that would have allowed his ''resurrection''. Unfortunately for Jelal, his father came to a harsh, if legally correct ruling of guilt, and had his own son ruthlessly destroyed.\n\nFollowing the discovery in {{yearlinkConvert|3389|NY}} of the ''[[shadow mythallar]]s'' created by the [[Shadow Consortium]], those constructs also became used for legal executions, starting with the guilty [[Shiris Blamira]].\n\nKarsus almost destroyed the enclave in {{yearlinkConvert|3451|NY}} when he created an enormous blob of [[heavy magic]] and imbued it with ''[[Volhm's drain]]''. The heavy magic mass pulled energy from the ''mythallar'' and then cycled it back, meaning that all available magical energy was ''en route'' between the two points, but never available to the many dependent items and effects within the enclave, including its method of flight. As the city began to fall from the sky, Karsus used ''[[levitation]]'' and ''[[Tolodine's gust of wind]]'' to quickly toss the blob overboard and made it someone else's problem. The heavy magic blob was sent flying away into the [[High Forest]] where it struck the arcanist [[Wulgreth (Netheril)|Wulgreth]], killed him, and then turned him into a [[lich]]. The ''mythallar'' escaped unharmed.\n\nAt one point, Karsus developed a plan to install magic-reflecting mirrors all around the edge of the enclave so that even more unused energy could be reflected back into the ''mythallars'', creating a [[wikipedia:standing wave|standing wave]] of magical energy that would exponentially increase the efficiency and power available. Before he could put it into action, the sage [[Eugenius]] explained that such a course of action could very possibly annihilate the entire enclave in the [[Realms]]' largest [[fireworks]] display. Karsus decided against his plan and put it to rest."
