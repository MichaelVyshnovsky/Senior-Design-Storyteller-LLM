The Drunken Dragon was a tavern found in the city of Tsurlagol in the Vast.
The tavern was a favorite of Shaless of Tsurlagol, an adventurer. In Nightal of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, she returned to The Drunken Dragon and there displayed a selection of curious harps and beautiful, magical blades that she claimed to have found in Myth Drannor. Maerhult, a bard also visiting the tavern, examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor.
