'''The Drunken Dragon''' was a tavern found in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

The tavern was a favorite of [[Shaless]] of [[Tsurlagol]], an [[adventurer]]. In [[Nightal]] of [[1357 DR|the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], she returned to The Drunken Dragon and there displayed a selection of curious [[harp]]s and beautiful, [[magic]]al [[blade]]s that she claimed to have found in [[Myth Drannor]]. [[Maerhult]], a [[bard]] also visiting the tavern, examined two of her harps and pronounced them to be genuine works of old Myth Drannor.
