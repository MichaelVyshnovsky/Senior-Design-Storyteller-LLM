The '''Shrine to Bane''' was the place of worship of [[Bane|the Lord of Darkness]] in the town of [[Teshwave]] in [[Teshendale]] after [[1316 DR]] when it was occupied by the [[Black Network]].

==Description==
The Shrine to Bane was run by members of the [[Church of Bane]] and agents from [[Zhentil Keep]]. The shrine was closed to all but individuals who generated evil, chaos, and destruction, as well as those who worshiped the Black Hand. To those allowed in, the shrine offered healing and [[cleric]]al magics; however, all visitors were recorded and reported to Zhentil Keep. Adventurers seeking to avoid the gaze of [[Fzoul Chembryl]] were advised to avoid the shrine.
