The '''Captains' Court''' was the main government building in [[Luskan]].

==Location==
The palace was located one block ahead of the south wall of Luskan, specifically on [[Aldever's Street]], opposite the [[Hall of Warriors]].

==Interior==
Several offices and assembly chambers were housed within the Captains' Court, not only for the [[High Captains of Luskan]], but for their assistants as well.

==Activities==
The High Captains governed Luskan from within here. As such, all laws (after approval by the [[mage]]s of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]]) were pronounced here.

==Defenses==
Sets of guards and officers protected the hall from any intruders. At least thirty members of Luskan's militia guarded this single building, in and out. During assemblies of the High Captains, around a hundred soldiers could be on guard.
