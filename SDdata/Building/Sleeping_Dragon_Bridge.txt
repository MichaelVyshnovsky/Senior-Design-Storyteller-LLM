The Sleeping Dragon Bridge was one of the three emblematic bridges of Neverwinter.
The bridge was carved in the likeness of a dragon.
The Sleeping Dragon Bridge, alongside the other two bridges, radiated out of Castle Never, connecting it with the rest of the city. In the Sleeping Dragons case, it connected the castle with the Hall of Justice.
During the Ruining of 1451 DR, the Sleeping Dragon Bridge was destroyed by the cataclysm.
In 1479 DR, the Sleeping Dragon Bridge was the site of the last battle of the siege of Neverwinter.
