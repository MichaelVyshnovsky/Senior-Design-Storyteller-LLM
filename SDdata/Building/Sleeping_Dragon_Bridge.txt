The '''Sleeping Dragon Bridge''' was one of the three emblematic bridges of [[Neverwinter]].

==Description==
The bridge was carved in the likeness of a [[dragon]].

==Location==
The Sleeping Dragon Bridge, alongside the other two bridges, radiated out of [[Castle Never]], connecting it with the rest of the city. In the Sleeping Dragon's case, it connected the castle with the [[Hall of Justice]].

==History==
During the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], the Sleeping Dragon Bridge was destroyed by the cataclysm.

In [[1479 DR]], the Sleeping Dragon Bridge was the site of the last battle of the [[siege of Neverwinter]].
