It was the source of a stream that flowed down to Saerb.\nThe fountain was actually a petrified wizard named Yalumvrael of Athkatla whose body was turned to stone and enspelled to produce an endless flow of water. Yalumvrael earned this fate after he attempted to slay the Magister Alvaerele Tasundrym. Yalumvraels body was buried in a landslide, but the site retained its original name.\nCategoryFountains\nCategoryLocations in High Dale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\npxy5j0l1aiorv2hs559s2ftcem3jifu"
