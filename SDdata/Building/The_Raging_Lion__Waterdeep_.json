Glowing globes illuminated the interior.\nThe inn maintained a strict policy against lighting any flames this included smoking tobacco products.\nThe cellar of the Raging Lion was once used as a temple by noble cultists of Kambadlan the Black Tortoise of Night. This was the source of several Waterdhavian oaths including \"by the Black Tortoise!\" and \"by the shell of Kambadlan!\"\nThe Raging Lion was owned by a man named Lhaerhlin Masram. Several dwarves and female adventurers used the inn as their home. They helped Lhaerhlin maintain order during their stays between outings."
