'''Rising Raven Inn''' was a lonesome inn located at the outside of the southeastern wall of [[Westgate]].

==Location==
The inn stood outside of the city's walls, near its south gate.

==Services==
The Rising Raven Inn was usually packed with traders and adventurers, offering the standard services such as food, lodging, and more importantly a warm bath after the long road.

Notably, the inn had a small private guest room, outside the main building, past the stable. The apartment was cramped but surprisingly clean. The room contained a stove, always filled with firewood and bunk beds. Upon request, the innkeeper sent young servant boys with a large copper bathtub, an ornate screen, [[bucket]]s of water (more was accessible via a well nearby the apartment), and an oversized [[kettle]] to warm the bathwater.

==History==
In [[1357 DR]] a hero sellsword [[Alias]] along with her companions [[Akabar Bel Akash]], [[Dragonbait]], and [[Olive Ruskettle]] briefly stayed at the inn's private apartment. They barely had time to rest and clean up before Alias' evil masters, led by [[Cassana]], ambushed and captured the group.
