The Witch-Dukes Bride was a tavern found in Suzail in 1486 DR, formerly known as The High Tankard.
Posh decorations abounded within the tavern, including polished wood paneling along the walls and artfully hung lamps. A large glaive-fish was mounted over the doors leading to the kitchen.
The tavern stood next door to Danains hardware store to the west, on the southern side of the Promenade, three city blocks away from Cormyrs Royal Court.
In the 14 century DR, the establishment was known as the High Tankard that serves ales and cheeses exclusively. It was owned by the Brewers and Cheesemakers Guild, and its headquarters, The Caskhouse, was located above the tavern on the buildings second floor.
As of the , Witch-Dukes Bride was still considered a relatively new establishment, yet it was favored by the rich and noble of the city and travelers from afar alike. In the late 15 century DR, the taverns owner was Mastaal Gerahgen, an ex-ship captain and the owner of one of the largest selections of liquors in Suzail, imported from across the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Sometime circa 1486 DR, the Witch-Dukes Bride became a site of an argument between members of Marliir and Huntcrown noble families of Cormyr that resulted in a duel challenge.
