The '''Witch-Duke's Bride''' was a [[tavern]] found in [[Suzail]] in [[1486 DR]], formerly known as '''The High Tankard'''.

==Description==
Posh decorations abounded within the tavern, including polished wood paneling along the walls and artfully hung lamps. A large [[glaive]]-fish was mounted over the doors leading to the kitchen.

The tavern stood next door to [[Danain's]] hardware store to the west, on the southern side of the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], three city blocks away from [[Cormyr's Royal Court]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|65-66,75}}

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the establishment was known as the High Tankard that serves [[ale]]s and [[cheese]]s exclusively. It was owned by the [[Brewers and Cheesemakers Guild]], and its headquarters, [[The Caskhouse]], was located above the tavern on the building's second floor.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Witch-Duke's Bride was still considered a relatively new establishment, yet it was favored by the rich and noble of the city and travelers from afar alike. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the tavern's owner was [[Mastaal Gerahgen]], an ex-ship captain and the owner of one of the largest selections of liquors in Suzail, imported from across the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

Sometime ''circa'' 1486 DR, the Witch-Duke's Bride became a site of an argument between members of [[Marliir]] and [[Huntcrown]] noble families of Cormyr that resulted in a duel challenge.
