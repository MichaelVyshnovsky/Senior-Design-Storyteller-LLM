The Sanctum of the Scroll was a temple dedicated to Oghma, the Lord of Knowledge, found in Selgaunt.
The "Scroll" in the temples title referred to Oghma himself, but the temple did have an impressive collection of magic scrolls. Scrolls were sometimes sold to help fund the temple.
High Loremaster Undryl Yannathar headed a clergy of 16 priests.
