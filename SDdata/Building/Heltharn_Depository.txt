The Heltharn Depository was a vault in New Sarshell as of the late 14 century DR.
The structure was three stories tall, bristling with defensive stonework. There were letters carved atop the lintel, announcing it was named "Heltharn Depository". The building faced a street.
Heltharn Depository held on to coin for a fee.
In , Seren Juramot had been using the depository to store the money she sought to use to buy her freedom from Thay after the loss of her enclaves funds in Ravens Bluff during the Spellplague. That year, however, after Xxiphu rose from the depths, Seren found the ogres that usually kept watch at the front door missing she inquired with other customers, and learned they claimed to have appointed Morgenthel as its new Master of Coins.
Besides the defensive stonework, two ogres generally guarded the entrance. Inside, a number of protective wards and charms were active.
