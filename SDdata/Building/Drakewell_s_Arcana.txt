'''Drakewell's Arcana''' was a shop in [[Mulmaster]] that catered to practitioners of [[the Art]] that lived in the city during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Cloaks and Shadows|10-12}}

==Location==
The shop was situated between a number of other storefronts on [[Fireball Alley]]. It was easily identified by its sign that featured a [[pseudodragon]] curled around the hat of a [[wizard]].

==Interior==
The two-story shop was fairly unremarkable in its design and decor. The bottom floor held the shop's showroom along with a storage space in the back, while the top floor housed a living quarters and personal study.{{Cite adventurers league/Cloaks and Shadows|34}}

The store room of Drakewell's Arcana had a secret door disguised within a wardrobe that led to a private chamber that housed a shrine to one of the [[Archomental|Princes]] of [[Elemental Evil]].

==Services==
A variety of items useful to [[mage]]s could be purchased at Drakewell's, including [[staves]], [[robe]]s that did not impede spellcasting, and fashionable hats. Some of the specific magic items included a cloak that would never dampen, even in the rain; an ever-filling [[ink]] well; and a [[wand]] that could conjure forth a single [[toad]] every day.

==Activities==
Drakewell's Arcana was owned and operated by [[Veren Drakewell]], a member of the [[Brotherhood of the Cloak]] and secret cultist of [[Yan-C-Bin]]. Veren used his shop to spy on his fellow Cloaks for the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, guards from the [[City Watch (Mulmaster)|City Watch]] along with a Cloak turned the shop upside down while investigating the murder of Cloak [[Zel Tregarthen]]. They discovered that Veren himself had been killed as well.
