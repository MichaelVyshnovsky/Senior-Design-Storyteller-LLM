'''The Beacon''' was a pleasant inn in [[Thentia]]. It was named for the globe lit by a [[continual flame]] mounted on its roof.

==Location==
The Inlet was on a main intersection in south-eastern Thentia, not far from the docks.

==Interior==
The Beacon's bedrooms were soundproofed to ensure a good night's sleep.

==Services==
The Beacon particularly attracted boisterous travelers and adventurers who desired a comfortable and friendly place to relax at. It offered food, drink, and bedrooms, and all three for the night were provided for 8 [[gp]]. The innkeep [[Moavar]] enjoyed telling tales of his time on the sea, both true and false.
