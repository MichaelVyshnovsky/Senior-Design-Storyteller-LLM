==Location==
Rusty's was a small two-story stone and wood building with a carefully constructed sign announcing the business's name planted outside. The building was partially built on land, partially supported by wooden beams over the [[Bay of Mists]] next to a long dock, not far from the district's gates, and surrounded by a hive of businesses, warehouses, and homes.

==Services==
Some of the more popular tattoo designs included ''[[Rope & Anchor]],'' ''[[Heart & Arrow]]'', ''[[Eye & Tears]],'' and ''[[Gnaked Gnome]]''. Two people, one tattoo each, were going for a hundred [[gold]] total at a special discount rate after the war of Neverwinter and [[Luskan]].

==History==
Rusty Al's was an established business by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He and his shop survived the strife of that year: the [[plague]] of the [[Wailing Death]] that ravaged Neverwinter and the crumbling economy after the war between Luskan and Neverwinter. As the city recovered, Al's pawn business was suffering from the greatly weakened economy, so much of the business's [[coin]] came from tattooing. When a duo of adventuring sailors that included [[Nisar Zayid]] was seeking to depart for the [[Nelanther Isles]] in 1372 DR, Rusty Al offered a special deal on tattoo designs that might've been appealing to both adventuring sailors.
