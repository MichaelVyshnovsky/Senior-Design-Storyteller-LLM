        "mainbody": "arroch Castle was a castle that existed in the Feywild and was the home to Neifion, the Lord of Bats, in the late 14 century DR.\nThe castle was located deep within a cave system in Feywild, surrounded by dark purple mushroom outcrops. It was a vast gothic structure, constructed out of void-black blocks. The castles central spire towered high above the walls. The spire almost reached the vaults stalactite-toothed ceiling. The spire was framed with ebony dragon-like wings stretching from each side of the structure.\nFollowing the gates of Castle Darroch was a long entry gauntlet. Past the castles entry laid the foyer, lit by numerous green-flamed candelabras. In the middle of the foyer laid a wide but shallow pool of dark water half-flooding the area, and long, pale forms darted beneath its surface. Past the pool was the castles staircase. On the fourth floor, the Grand Study was located, the walls and halls of which were littered with paintings of surreal landscapes, sculptures of fantastic beings, and objects too strange for mortal classification behind glass displays. Above the Grand Study was a balcony overlooking the collection, accessible via a narrow stair on the wall.\nThe balcony housed a large iron door, and past it was a feast hall. In the center of the hall, was a great oaken table surrounded by chairs, each one unique in design and workmanship, as if every piece was imported from a completely different realm and culture a few of them were so oddly shaped that a regular person would find it difficult to sit.\n* Neifion, Lord of Bats\n* Homunculi \n* Bats of all types, many unknown to Toril"
