        "Location": "It was located on [[Zastrow Street]] (formerly Slut Street), next door to the [[Purple Palace]] [[festhall]] (with a narrow side alley separating them) and two doors up from the [[Old Xoblob Shop]].",

        "Services": "This shop sold the various items found in ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Opening hours were dawn to dusk. \n\nThe nearby Old Xoblob Shop was not a competitor for the catalogue counter, as the curio shop sold everything Aurora's did not, could not, or would not.",
        "Staff": "In the mid-1360s [[DR]], [[Aglatha Shrey]] worked here as a counter clerk and [[Beradyx Halfwinter]]  was a transportation mage who delivered goods to the store by [[teleport]]ing them. In addition, there were two brawny guards who worked during opening hours."
