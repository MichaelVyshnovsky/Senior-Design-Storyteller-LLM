The Bounty of the Goddess was a temple of Chauntea located in the town of Archenbridge, in the Dalelands during the mid–14 century DR. It was run by High Harvestmaster Thaliach Mindogar, and staffed by several lesser clerics.
The temple was located in the center of the city, on the River Way&mdashthe most exclusive neighborhood of Archenbridge.
The temple had a magnificent façade, with a large arched doorway flanked by two towering pillars that resembled stalks of wheat. This facade led into a large barn filled with plants and crops all sown into the temples floor of tilled earth.
In the front garden of the temple was a large, stone fountain in the shape of Chauntea. In this depiction, sculpted by the famous dwarven stonemason Feldyn Fullbellow, the All-mother took the form of a barely clothed woman emerging from a blossoming flower extending one hand into the air. From her hand emerged an arc of water, which was blessed by her priests three times per day.
In addition to typical temple services, the Bounty of the Goddess sold vials of the blessed fountain water. A single vial cost 25 gp, or 20 gp for visiting clergy or dedicated followers of Chauntea.
During the 14 century DR the worship of Chauntea was a large part of life for many of the Archenfolk, even in the face of expanding commerce and mercantile enterprises. This was due in large part to the leadership of High Harvestmaster Mindogar under his guidance, the churchs identity transformed from placid and reliable to a local power with political and economic influence.
By the , Chauntea had become the most-worshiped deity within Archenbridge.
Local tales told that if a priest of Chauntea was slain in the Arkhen Vale, the fountain water would turn to blood. It was said this blood could cure disease, infections from fungi or molds, mummy rot, lycanthropy, and withering, and that it could even make barren lands fertile. The clergy understandably discouraged people from spreading such rumors.
