The '''Mosque of Blood''' was the second-most-noticeable feature of the [[Zakhara]]n city of [[Qudra]].

==Location==
This crimson-covered mosque was the largest temple in the entire [[Land of Fate]] used to worship the warrior-god [[Vataqatal]].

==Structure==
The walls of this mosque were made of regular sandstone but were coated regularly with henna to honor those who shed their blood in battle.
