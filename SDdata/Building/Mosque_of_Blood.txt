The Mosque of Blood was the second-most-noticeable feature of the Zakharan city of Qudra.
This crimson-covered mosque was the largest temple in the entire Land of Fate used to worship the warrior-god Vataqatal.
The walls of this mosque were made of regular sandstone but were coated regularly with henna to honor those who shed their blood in battle.
