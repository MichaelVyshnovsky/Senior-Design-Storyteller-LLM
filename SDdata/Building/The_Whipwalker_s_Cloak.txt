The '''Whipwalker's Cloak''' was a tavern located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Location==
The Whipwalker's Cloak was appropriately located along [[Pain Street]] in the [[Zhentil Keep/Common Quarter|Common Quarter]] of western Zhentil Keep.

==Inhabitants==
Given its close proximity to the [[Tower of Pain Exalted]], a temple dedicated to [[Loviatar]], many of the patrons within the Whipwalker's Cloak were worshipers of the Maiden of Pain. Any miscreants causing trouble within the tavern were usually granted at least a dozen lashes by Loviatar's faithful before being thrown out onto the street to serve as a warning to others.
