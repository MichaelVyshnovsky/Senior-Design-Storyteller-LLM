The Whipwalkers Cloak was a tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The Whipwalkers Cloak was appropriately located along Pain Street in the Common Quarter of western Zhentil Keep.
Given its close proximity to the Tower of Pain Exalted, a temple dedicated to Loviatar, many of the patrons within the Whipwalkers Cloak were worshipers of the Maiden of Pain. Any miscreants causing trouble within the tavern were usually granted at least a dozen lashes by Loviatars faithful before being thrown out onto the street to serve as a warning to others.
