It was unusual among the homes of senators for being located in the impoverished fourth quarter of Innarlith, where it was surrounded by the city's lower class. The city's elite typically didn't venture into the fourth quarter, but Pristoleph on the other hand had grown up in poverty here and had chosen it as the site of his opulent home after he became wealthy and powerful.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], an unsuccesful assassination attempt on Pristoleph was made at Pristal Towers by a [[Maurezhi]] who had been clandestinely summoned by the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]]. The Maurezhi was disguised as the [[Water naga]] [[Svayyah]] from the [[Nagaflow]]. Pristoleph's bodyguards successfully fought off the attack and the demon fled. <ref>",
