The manor also featured garden balconies.\nThe interior of the building was luxurious.\nPristoleph was in possession of this structure by at least 1368 DR. It was unusual among the homes of senators for being located in the impoverished fourth quarter of Innarlith, where it was surrounded by the citys lower class. The citys elite typically didnt venture into the fourth quarter, but Pristoleph on the other hand had grown up in poverty here and had chosen it as the site of his opulent home after he became wealthy and powerful.\nIn 1373 DR, an unsuccesful assassination attempt on Pristoleph was made at Pristal Towers by a Maurezhi who had been clandestinely summoned by the Red Wizard Marek Rymüt. The Maurezhi was disguised as the Water naga Svayyah from the Nagaflow. Pristolephs bodyguards successfully fought off the attack and the demon fled. \n* Pristoleph\n* Phyrea"
