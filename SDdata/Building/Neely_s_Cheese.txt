'''Neely's Cheese''' was a [[cheese]]maker's shop located on [[Slake Street]] in the Living District of [[Arrabar]].

==Location==
Neely's stood on Slake Street, a short walk away from one of the Living District's large open-air markets.

==Structure==
A sign with Neely's name hung outside the shop's doors. The store was inside a small square building with a courtyard in its middle. A backroom attached to the store's front had an exit into the courtyard and stairs up to the second floor. The upstairs floor had several rooms, a patio facing Slake Street, and each side of the square had a balcony overlooking the central courtyard. The center square had a single rainwater [[barrel]], and all walls were covered in climbing plants and flower-filled hanging baskets, typical for the city of Arrabar.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, Neely's Cheese employed a young commoner woman named [[Mirolyn Skolotti]]. In 1373 DR, her sister was murdered by supposed members of the [[Municipal Guard of Arrabar]] who claimed she was falsely advertising herself as a [[wizard]] via forehead markings. The deed was witnessed by [[Vambran Matrell]] of the [[Order of the Sapphire Crescent]] who took it upon himself to investigate the injustice. When Vambran tracked the killed woman's family, Mirolyn and her aging blind mother [[Nimra Skolotti]], they agreed to be interviewed by the young noble in the privacy of Neely's Cheese's patio, away from prying eyes.
