        "Inhabitants": "As of the late 15{{th}} century, Bahamut's monastery was inhabited by a band of semi-intelligent, non-violent [[kobold]]s who devoted themselves to the tenets of Bahamut's faith. Notable among them were [[Agga]], [[Blepp]], [[Myla]], and [[Zark]], among others. Two humans took up residence within the temple: [[Tarak]] an enthusiastic botanist, and [[Varnoth Wender|Varnoth]], the retired leader of the [[Azure Wolves]] mercenary company.\n\nThe monastery was led by Elder [[Runara]], a [[bronze dragon]] who often took the form of a [[human]].",
        "History": "{{Quote|As you have discovered, this island has many old wounds. And I'm, afraid the cycle of violence is starting again. I have one more favor to ask of you.|Elder Runara, to the adventurers.}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1481}}, a group of five [[adventurer]]s came to Dragon's Rest from the city of [[Neverwinter]]. They were ferried across by the scoundrel captain named [[Drauz|Drauz the Dreg]] from the city's [[Neverwinter/Blacklake District|Blacklake District]].{{Cite document/Before the Storm}}\n\nElder Runara observed the adventurers with the hope they would prove trustworthy enough to retrieve her lost [[wyrmling]] Aidron from the disgruntled dragon [[Sparkrender]]."
