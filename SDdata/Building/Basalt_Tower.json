        "mainbody": "The '''Basalt Tower''' was a colossal stone tower located on the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].",
        "Description": "Leading up to the Basalt Tower was a damaged stone bridge that connected it to a rocky outcropping. That hellish platform held a ''[[portal]]'' that connected to the [[Prime Material plane]], more specifically, the basement of [[Dragonspear Castle]] on [[Toril]].\n\nThe tower's peak was accessible by means of a [[iron]]-lattice elevator that was suspended by four enormous chains.",
        "Defenses": "For some time at least, the entrance to the tower was guarded by the [[devil]] known as [[Thrix|Thrix the Profane]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Hero of Baldur's Gate]] descended into Avernus and arrived at the Basalt Tower while in pursuit of [[Caelar Argent]]. The [[baatezu]] [[Belhifet]] made his final stand against the [[aasimar]] [[paladin]] and the [[Bhaalspawn]] at the top of the tower."
