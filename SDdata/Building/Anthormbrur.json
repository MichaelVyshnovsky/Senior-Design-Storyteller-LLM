        "mainbody": "nthormbrur was the name of the klathlaaedin (ornately carved stone mansion) belonging to the elite Horthander family located in Khôltar, south Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis elegant compound was located on the northeast side of Hael Way on the point of land between Hael Way and the North Way. It backed up against Baharrokhbrur, the klathlaaedin belonging to the rival Khaundrove family, which faced North Way to the east.\nThe eye-catching feature of this klathlaaedin was the central five-story needle-tower with its outer surface covered with leaping flames, human faces with watchful eyes, and many beasts, both mundane and monstrous, all carved into the stone. A squat, two-story attachment with a large, round window facing the courtyard connected the tower with the two wings. Both wings were sturdy three-floor rectangular buildings with sharply peaked roofs that formed a wide angle embracing the courtyard and gardens. The once-extensive enclosed gardens were mostly converted to stables as the Horthander passion for racing horses grew."
