        "mainbody": "'''Anthormbrur''' was the name of the klathlaaedin (ornately carved stone mansion) belonging to the elite [[Horthander]] family located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|68-69}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Khôltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}",
        "Location": "This elegant compound was located on the northeast side of [[Hael Way]] on the point of land between Hael Way and the [[North Way]]. It backed up against [[Baharrokhbrur]], the klathlaaedin belonging to the rival [[Khaundrove]] family, which faced North Way to the east.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|67-68}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 53: Khôltar, Part 4, Our Tour Begins}}",
        "Structure": "The eye-catching feature of this klathlaaedin was the central five-story needle-tower with its outer surface covered with leaping flames, human faces with watchful eyes, and many beasts, both mundane and monstrous, all carved into the stone. A squat, two-story attachment with a large, round window facing the courtyard connected the tower with the two wings. Both wings were sturdy three-floor rectangular buildings with sharply peaked roofs that formed a wide angle embracing the courtyard and gardens. The once-extensive enclosed gardens were mostly converted to stables as the Horthander passion for racing horses grew."
