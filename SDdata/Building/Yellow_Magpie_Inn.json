        "mainbody": "The Yellow Magpie Inn was an inn in the Tu Lung city of Balanzia around .\nThis inn was located in the eastern portion of Balanzia, a few blocks away from the Gate of Hangto.\nAround , the Yellow Magpie was one of many buildings that were destroyed in Balanzia as the city fell at the hands of the Shou Lung invasion of Tu Lung.The Yellow Magpie Inn is not explicitly stated in text to have been destroyed in the incident that destroyed the city. However, on the \"before-and-after\" maps of Balanzia in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms the building is not present on the \"after\" version. Therefore, it can be inferred that it was likely destroyed."
