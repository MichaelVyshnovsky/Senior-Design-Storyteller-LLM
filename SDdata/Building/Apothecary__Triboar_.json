        "mainbody": "The apothecary in Triboar was a shop belonging to Tarmock Felaskur that sold medicine as of the late 15 century DR. It was also notable for its carbonated sweet water.\nThe shop was located on the east side of town north of the Evermoor Way. It sat across the street from the Northshield House inn.\nThe building was a sunken wood cottage covered in ivy and marked by a wooden sign in the shape of a potion bottle. A broken wheelbarrow sat out front just beneath the sign.\nThe store sold herbal remedies and salves of dubious effectiveness. It also sold sweet water for 1 gold piece per flask."
