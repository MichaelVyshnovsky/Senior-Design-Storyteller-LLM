        "mainbody": "Material Assistance was a magic shop in the Flask Circle market of Ravens Bluff, in the late 14 century DR, owned by an elderly former wizard named Tarwell.\nOutside the shop hung a sign with a depiction of a clover. Its interior was richly furnished, with everything made of polished wood that gleamed under the light of candles, including a rocking chair that Tarwell could usually be found sitting upon.\nThis shop specialized in selling material components for spells. The owner would claim that the prices offered for these components were far fairer than those in Ravens Bluffs marketplace, referring to the merchants there as being practically \"thieves\".\nAround the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the alchemist Wendell. When they entered Tarwell was rather pleased to see them. They showed him their shopping list, causing the former wizard to put on a robe and scrounge through its many pockets. Within them Tarwell was able to find a crushed emerald, some jamain root, maple leaves, and sulfurous ash, but lacked any hair from bookas. He attempted to cast some form of conjuration spell to bring forth a booka, but it strained him too much.\nOverall Tarwell charged the party sixteen gold pieces for the components. He then offered them directions to Anderson Farm, claiming that the adventurers could find some bookas there."
