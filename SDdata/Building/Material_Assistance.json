        "mainbody": "'''Material Assistance''' was a magic shop in the [[Flask Circle]] market of [[Ravens Bluff]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], owned by an elderly former [[wizard]] named [[Tarwell]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|6}}",
        "Structure": "Outside the shop hung a sign with a depiction of a [[clover]]. Its interior was richly furnished, with everything made of polished wood that gleamed under the light of [[candle]]s, including a rocking chair that Tarwell could usually be found sitting upon.",
        "Services": "This shop specialized in selling [[material component]]s for [[spell]]s. The owner would claim that the prices offered for these components were far fairer than those in Ravens Bluff's marketplace, referring to the merchants there as being practically \"thieves\".",
        "History": "Around the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Flask Circle in search of supplies for the [[alchemist]] [[Wendell]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3-4}} When they entered Tarwell was rather pleased to see them. They showed him their shopping list, causing the former wizard to put on a [[robe]] and scrounge through its many pockets. Within them Tarwell was able to find a crushed [[emerald]], some [[jamain]] root, [[maple]] leaves, and [[sulfur|sulfurous ash]], but lacked any hair from [[booka]]s. He attempted to cast some form of [[conjuration]] spell to bring forth a booka, but it strained him too much.\n\nOverall Tarwell charged the party sixteen [[gold piece]]s for the components. He then offered them directions to [[Anderson Farm]], claiming that the adventurers could find some bookas there.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|7}}"
