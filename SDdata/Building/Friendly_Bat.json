        "mainbody": "The Friendly Bat was an inn and tavern found in the village of Womford during the late 15 century DR. It was run by the dwarven couple Grunnald and Mae for a time, until Grunnald went missing and Mae was left as its sole proprietor.\nThe Friendly Bats taproom featured an effigy of its former owner Grunnald, made by Mae and their daughter Muren. \nAs was common among many taverns, the Friendly Bat offered rooms for rent and ale to its patrons.\nSome time during or before the 1490s DR, the village of Womford was taken over by the bandit gang known as the Pale Claw. The bandits stole all the wealth from the villages people. To help his family and his fellow townspeople, Grunnald joined the bandits, with the aim of redirecting their efforts to targets outside the town. Unfortunately, this left Mae and Muren to run the Friendly Bat on their own. In any case, the gangs influence over town left the tavern empty much of the time.\nSome time after Grunnalds disappearance, group of adventurers led by Edgin Darvis ran the Pale Claw out of Womford for good. They reunited the reluctant \"Bandit King\" with his family the reconciliation was a rather complicated affair."
