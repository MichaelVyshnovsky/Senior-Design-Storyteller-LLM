Only by correctly calibrating the clock to five lesser clocks located in adjoining rooms could one access the depths of the crypts.",
        "Defenses": "In addition to its traps, the mausoleum's door was heavily reinforced and sealed with complex lock that made it extraordinarily difficult to access the crypts directly. Opening the door required that a series of mechanical seals be unlocked around Craftsman's Rest near the Crypts, as well as a metaphysical seal&mdash;known as the \"Shadow Lock\"&mdash;located in the [[Graveyard (Evernight)|graveyard]] of [[Evernight]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = I am the most ominous and portentous hour.<br />Both the darkest and the lightest,<br />And the greatest of them all.<br />What am I?\n| source = The \"Question of Time\".

        "History": "The Crypts were commissioned by [[Lucan Greenharrow]], a co-founder of the Waterclock Guild, at some point before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], as he wanted a place to conduct his [[magic]]al research in secret. The catacombs were built using the guild's most advanced techniques.\n\nOne of the high ranking Guild members, [[Romani Monini]], was also a member of the Cult of the Dragon, and stored artifacts relevant to the Rite of the Dracolich within the crypts. In addition, when he was buried, he ordered that the young [[blue dragon]] [[Azharzel]] be sealed in the crypt alongside him.\n\nAt some point after the [[Spellplague]], the Waterclock Guild abandoned the crypts, leaving almost all of the previously bound [[elemental]]s to their own devices. However, when members of the Waterclock Guild began returning to Neverwinter in the late 15{{th}} century DR, some sought to reclaim the crypts, either to recover lost examples of the Guild's water clocks or to inter their guildmates who had died since the fall of the Guild. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a [[thieves' guild]] led by [[Palas]] broke into the crypts and stole a valuable water clock. They subsequently made plans to return and plunder the crypts further.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Sel√ªne|17}} \n\nFollowing the [[Siege of Neverwinter]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]]'s [[Thayan]] forces broke into the Waterclock Guild Crypts in a race against the Cult of the Dragon, and obtained both Azharzel and the artifacts that would allow her to transform him into a dracolich.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, a section of the crypts became separated from the rest of the complex when a passage collapsed. who evidently gained access via the catacombs of the neighboring [[Hallix Mausoleum]].",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to binding water elementals and [[water weird]]s within the crypts, the Waterclock Guild bound a [[marid]] named [[Shanzezim]], preventing him from leaving. Long after the fall of the Guild, he occupied himself by assembling [[clock]]s in a makeshift workshop in the catacombs.\n\nAfter the Guild abandoned the crypts in the 15{{th}} century DR, they came to be occupied by [[undead]] as well as a massive [[giant spider]] known as [[Shoth|Shoth the Tomb Queen]]."
