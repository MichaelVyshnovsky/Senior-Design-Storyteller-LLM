Only members of the Arcane Brotherhood or of Ship Kurth were permitted to cross. \nIt was a short, arching bridge\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Arcane Brotherhood had placed a secret ward on Sword Bridge that allowed them to summon battle horrors to protect access to Cutlass Island.\nWhen forces led by Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry attacked Luskan to drive out Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood in the , a major turning point occurred when High Captain Kurth permitted their forces to cross the Dark Arch and Sword Bridge to attack Cutlass Island and the Host Tower of the Arcane by land. Sword Bridge was defended at this time by the Brotherhoods wizards, who were insufficient to stop the attackers.\nWhen efforts to rebuild the Host Tower began in the late 15 century DR, Beniago Kurths control over the bridge (and thus access to Cutlass Island) allowed him to persuade the newcomers into an alliance with his Ship circa 1484 DR.\nWhen House Margaster invaded Luskan in the , Sword Bridge was briefly occupied by gnolls."
