'''St. Dobla's Abbey''' was a remote [[Ilmatari]] abbey named for [[Saint Dobla]]. It was notably the fourth oldest Ilmatari site in the nation of [[Calimshan]].

==Location==
This remote abbey was located in the [[Marching Mountains]] of Calimshan.

==Activities==
Like other Ilmatari abbeys and cloisters in the Marching Mountains, who were beyond the reach of the [[syl-pasha]], the clergy of St. Dobla's were among the most active of Calimshan's Ilmatari clergies in regards to the protection and freeing of [[slavery|slaves]].

Uniquely, the clergy of St. Dobla's was focused on preaching equality and coexistence among the [[gender and sex|genders and sexes]]. Their abbey was considered to be among the few places in Calimshan where women could not only openly wield influence, but pursue an education.
==Inhabitants==
The clergy of St. Dobla was primarily made up of women and was one of the most populous of the Marching Mountain clergies.

==Reputation==
Having a largely female clergy, some outsiders had the false assumption that its members were proponents of matriarchy. In addition, due to the martyr Saint Dobla having been a [[jhasina]] in life, some crudely believed that the abbey's clergy engaged in licentious and wanton activities.
