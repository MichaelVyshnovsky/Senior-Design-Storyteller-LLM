        "mainbody": "'''Northshield House''' was a quality inn found in the town of [[Triboar]] in the late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was a reserved and stately establishment that was run by the Phorndyl family for many years, before changing hands to the Meltimers.",
        "Location": "It lay in the east of town, opposite the [[Apothecary (Triboar)|Apothecary]].<ref>",
        "Atmosphere": "The inn had an atmosphere of formality and calm. It was a modest but respectable place.<ref>",
        "Structure": "It was a clear and tidy place, with a common room on the ground floor and private rooms on the upper floor.",
        "Services": "Northshield House offered quality rooms for rent, with services and conditions a match for even the best inns in [[Waterdeep]], and it was just as pricy.\n\n''Circa'' [[1485 DR]], a staff of six ensured it was well-seen-to; they were well-paid and loyal. Three great [[mastiff]]s kept guard and slept within the common room.",
        "History": "As of [[1365 DR]], Northshield House was run by [[Dlukasz Phorndyl]].\n\nThe business stayed within the Phorndyl family for over a century, until around {{Yearlink|1475}}, when it was purchased by [[Urgala Meltimer]], a retired [[adventurer]], after the loss of her wife [[Darribeth Meltimer|Darribeth]]. It was still in her hands through the mid-1480s DR.\n\nIf adventurers rescued Darribeth around [[1492 DR]]{{Waterdeep-time}} and accompanied her to Triboar, then Urgala would reward them lifelong free room and board at Northshield House."
