        "mainbody": "Northshield House was a quality inn found in the town of Triboar in the late 14 and late 15 centuries DR. It was a reserved and stately establishment that was run by the Phorndyl family for many years, before changing hands to the Meltimers.\nIt lay in the east of town, opposite the Apothecary.\nThe inn had an atmosphere of formality and calm. It was a modest but respectable place.\nIt was a clear and tidy place, with a common room on the ground floor and private rooms on the upper floor.\nNorthshield House offered quality rooms for rent, with services and conditions a match for even the best inns in Waterdeep, and it was just as pricy.\nCirca 1485 DR, a staff of six ensured it was well-seen-to they were well-paid and loyal. Three great mastiffs kept guard and slept within the common room.\nAs of 1365 DR, Northshield House was run by Dlukasz Phorndyl.\nThe business stayed within the Phorndyl family for over a century, until around , when it was purchased by Urgala Meltimer, a retired adventurer, after the loss of her wife Darribeth. It was still in her hands through the mid-1480s DR.\nIf adventurers rescued Darribeth around 1492 DR and accompanied her to Triboar, then Urgala would reward them lifelong free room and board at Northshield House."
