The Tower of the Morning was an important temple to Lathander.
The tower was located in Telpir, a free city on the Dragon Coast.
Though structurally far more simple than the Spires of the Morning, this temple was considered the second-most prominent temple to the Morninglord.
As of 1369 DR, High Radiance Durneth Seafarer was in command of the tower. In 1374 DR, Durneth was still in charge. In Ches 28 of this year, edicts were issued at the tower that gave merit to the Risen Sun heresy.
