The '''North Tower''', also known as the '''Trolltower''', was a fortified structure in [[Waterdeep]] that stood at the most northerly tip of the city's [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] and on the western end of the [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]].

==Location==
On its southern side the structure stood along the junction of [[Trollkill Street]] and the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]], directly across from the [[Sated Satyr]] and north of the [[Armory of Waterdeep|city armory]].

On its northern side the structure stood among the [[Trollyard]] courtyard, directly across from the [[Trollfort]].

==Structure==
This structure stood four stories tall, had spires,<ref> and was directly connected to the [[Trollwall]] that separated the two wards.
===Interior===
Being a torchtower,<ref group="note" name="torchtower">Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of "torchtower." North Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-17 - Waterdeep's Torchtowers}}

Additionally, like any major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.<ref><ref group="note" name="major">The sourcebook ''[[City System]]'' states that all torchtowers with names are "major towers".

==Activities==
Like all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.

==Inhabitants==
North Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]].
