The '''Guardtower of the God''' was a temple of [[Helm]] erected in the city of [[Redwater (settlement)|Redwater]] during the first half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
The temple served as a training site for acolyte members of the [[church of Helm]].

==History==
The temple was founded by the famed [[Helmite]] priest [[Carath]], onetime bearer of the ''[[Helm of Helm]]'', some time after the {{YearlinkName|1313}}. Over the years, he attracted hundreds of followers during his tenure as head priest.

In the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, tragedy struck Redwater when the Guardtower of the God was sacked by allied [[church of Talos|Talosian]] and [[Sharran]] priests. The walls of the temple were brought down and Carath was crushed beneath the debris. Amid the ruins, Carath's wife [[Tayana]] wielded powerful magic and destroyed the evil clergy in a great conflagration. She then threw herself upon the fiery rubble and succumbed to the same fate as her love.

In the years that followed, Helm's faithful made pilgrimages to the ruined Guardtower, some of whom sought to recover the lost ''Helm of Helm''. The legendary [[relic]] eventually presented itself before a young faithful named [[Rolor]], who believed himself to be the reincarnated 'Sword of Helm'.
