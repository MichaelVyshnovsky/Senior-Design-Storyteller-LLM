'''The Ten Bells''' was a tavern in the town of [[Llorkh]] in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

==History==
It was the old tavern of Llorkh, predating the [[Zhentarim]] takeover in [[1357 DR]]. It was still in business in [[1370 DR]].

The travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]], when visiting Llorkh, once stopped at the Ten Bells. There he was accosted by four thugs, whom he suspected to be Zhentarim agents, and defended himself with magic. Leaving burning bodies behind, he promptly fled town, not desiring to return.
