The '''Keelhauled Dwarf''' was a subterranean tavern in the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
This tavern was situated in the cavernous cellar of the warehouse known as the [[House of Tarmagus]].

==Structure==
A set of pumps within a corner of the House of Tarmagus were constantly running in order to keep the Keelhauled Dwarf dry,{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1365795855517818882?s=20| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 27-02-2020| date = 27-02-2020}} Access stairs for those pumps continued on downward, through a secret panel, into the tavern itself. This acted as but one of many of the tavern's exits.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1365795867958128642?s=20| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 27-02-2020| date = 27-02-2020}}

==Atmosphere==
This tavern was popular among [[duergar]], as well as many of the city's [[half-orc]]s and [[rogue]]s.

==History==
One night a group of duergar visited [[Eaerdran Tarmagus]] in his bedchamber to threaten him, displeased with how he was cutting in on their business. Eardran calmly managed to strike a deal with the duergar,{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1365795865747746817?s=20| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 27-02-2020| date = 27-02-2020}} resulting in the existence of the Keelhauled Dwarf.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1365795866829815809?s=20| title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 27-02-2020| date = 27-02-2020}}
