The Keelhauled Dwarf was a subterranean tavern in the city of Waterdeep.
This tavern was situated in the cavernous cellar of the warehouse known as the House of Tarmagus.
A set of pumps within a corner of the House of Tarmagus were constantly running in order to keep the Keelhauled Dwarf dry, Access stairs for those pumps continued on downward, through a secret panel, into the tavern itself. This acted as but one of many of the taverns exits.
This tavern was popular among duergar, as well as many of the citys half-orcs and rogues.
One night a group of duergar visited Eaerdran Tarmagus in his bedchamber to threaten him, displeased with how he was cutting in on their business. Eardran calmly managed to strike a deal with the duergar, resulting in the existence of the Keelhauled Dwarf.
