'''Trader Fine Furs''' was one of the largest dealers of furs and pelts within the [[Dalelands]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. This old, family-run business specialized in the pelts of more exotic animals and monsters, and would often hire adventurers to slay specific beasts.

They recommended that their contractors kill creatures by means that inflicted as little tissue damage as possible. One such method was the use of the ''[[lightning bolt]]'' [[spell]].
