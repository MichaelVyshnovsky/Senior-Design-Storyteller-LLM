        "mainbody": "'''Distant Shores''' was a shop in [[Baldur's Gate]] that operated just outside the marketplace of [[The Wide]] in the [[Upper City]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was run by a married couple, [[Tendai Shore|Tendai]] and [[Khennen Shore]], who imported goods and products native to [[Chult]], by means of family members that lived in the then-independent colony of [[Port Nyanzaru]].",
        "Description": "The establishment was quite popular and, despite its humble decor, attracted the attention of several members of the Baldurian [[patriar]] families.",
        "Services": "The Shore family sold imported goods such as meats, cookery, recipes, and seasonings native to Chult. Among these exotic [[spices]] were [[coriander]], [[curry]], [[ginger]], and [[salt]]s of a myriad of colors.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the shop was vandalized over a period of weeks. These actions were taken due to the fact the owners refused to sell to a number of wealthy interested parties."
