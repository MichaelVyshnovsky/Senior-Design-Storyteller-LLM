Fine old swords and axes were displayed, as were Harper emblems and books.\nthumb|right|Xenk in the Harper sanctuary.\nIn the late 1490s DR, the paladin Xenk Yendar led Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, Simon Aumar, and Doric through Caldreths and into the Harper sanctuary, where he told them of the evil of the Red Wizards of Thay and Szass Tams takeover of Thay and the turning of its populace to undeath."
