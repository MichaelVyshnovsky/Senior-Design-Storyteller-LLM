The Mosque of Honored Elders was a temple devoted to Kor, the Zakharan god of wisdom, found in Muluk in 1367 DR.
The mosque was situated so that it faced the Plaza of the Ancients.
In addition to the worship of Kor, the mosque supported a hospital known to aid all those in need so long as they were enlightened. Donations were always appreciated for services received.
