'''The Nightgate Inn''' was a large and expensive inn

==Structure==
The Nightgate Inn was less of a fanciful inn and more of a fort that stood encircled by thick stone walls. The proprietors of the inn had a defensive agreement with [[Cormyr]]'s [[Purple Dragons]], who sent troops to the fort in times of war or siege.

==Interior==
Just like a military fort, the Nightgate Inn was a dark and damp building that was heated through constantly blazing fires in its massive common room. The inn was always comfortably warm, even during the coldest months of the year. However, the hearth's heat did not spread to the guest rooms. Guests were offered "bedmates"â€”thoroughly heated cloth-wrapped bricks. The hot stones were to be taken to bed, warming the guests through the night with the curtained beds containing the warmth.

==Services==
The inn offered its lodgings to travelers who arrived at Suzail by Calantar's Way after sundown and the East Gate's closure. It was the only inn available, and so it charged late arrivals accordingly and exuberantly.

The inn offered food of acceptable quality while its stables offered quality care to the guests' beasts of burden and steeds.

==History==
Renowned writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] featured the Nightgate Inn in his ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr|Guide to Cormyr]]'' available in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. His review focused on the establishment's high prices and somewhat lackluster services. and was owned by six shareholders. [[Shaluta Drennan]], who owned the smallest share of the establishment retired, influenced by poor health and advanced age. She sold the share to a young and dashing landed gentry nobleman [[Paresper Hethcanter]] who made [[coin]] through adventuring and invested it into the Nightgate Inn in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-04 - Hethcanter Family of Cormyr}}
