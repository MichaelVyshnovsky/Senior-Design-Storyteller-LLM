The Incanistaeum was a famous academy of magic in the city of Myth Drannor, whose secret was hidden to those who merely passed by. It was an entire community of mages and other practitioners of the Art, a town contained within the City of Song.
The school was located on Phelindra Street within the citys multicultural district of Dlabraddath.
By all appearances, the exterior of the Incanistaeum as a solid stone structure of fine dwarven construction. Only the keen eyes of a dwarf could determine that something about the building appeared "off".
The Incanistaeum was in fact "built" to comprise a great number of duo-dimensional spaces that added up to over 300 separate rooms and chambers, set across seven different floors.
The driving purposed of the Incanistaeum was to serve as a place where practitioners from all the races of Myth Drannor could study magic by instructors that were not all of elven heritage. Its founding members and first teachers were the noted mages that formed the Icanists Society, also known as the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor.
Unfortunately due to the nature of its founding, the Incanistaeum became a site for racial-politics between the citys more narrow-minded elves and members of its student body.
The Incanistaeum was established in late 4 century DR, in the . and the were-tiger archmage Tulrun.
In the midâ€“7 century the academy saw departure of some of its founding instructors, including Pyraan the Grim and Peridar Snowbrows in the , and Taeral Olortynaal who left two years later by the urging of his family. 
Taeral would return about a decade later, in the , but was accidental killed in a spell battle between elves and humans. Sun elf students framed Taerals death on the Incanistaeums last remaining non-elven student, Arlesn of Cormyr, who was banished from Myth Drannor forever.
By the , the only remaining instructor of the Incanistaeum was Sakaala of the Seven Rings. Both Mentor Wintercloak and the individual known as the Masked had departed Myth Drannor and taken with them their four remaining students.
Unlike other magical academies in Myth Drannor during its time, the Incanistaeum admitted students and apprentices from any of the numerous races that took up residence within the city.
