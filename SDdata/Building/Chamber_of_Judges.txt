The '''Chamber of Judges''' was part of the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The Chamber of Judges was a three-chambered structure.

==Activities==
The most important cases in Huzuz were judged here by experienced ''[[Midani dictionary#Q|qadi]]''. Judgment was usually given quickly, sometimes aided by magical means of determining the truth. Any case heard by the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] himself first passed through the Chamber of Judges to warrant its merit.

==Inhabitants==
The ''qadi'' and scribes were guarded by two full platoons of the [[Valiant Mamluk Society|Valiant]].
