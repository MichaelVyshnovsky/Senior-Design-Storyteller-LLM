The Chamber of Judges was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Chamber of Judges was a three-chambered structure.
The most important cases in Huzuz were judged here by experienced qadi. Judgment was usually given quickly, sometimes aided by magical means of determining the truth. Any case heard by the Grand Caliph himself first passed through the Chamber of Judges to warrant its merit.
The qadi and scribes were guarded by two full platoons of the Valiant.
