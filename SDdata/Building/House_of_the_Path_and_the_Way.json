        "mainbody": "The '''House of the Path and the Way''' was a shrine to the combined faith of [[the Path and the Way]] and the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] found in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>",
        "Location": "It stood in the [[Middle City]] of Bral, within the Temple District. It lay between Mainmast Street and Temple Street, and faced onto Temple Square.<ref>",
        "Activities": "A small and humble place, the House saw little in the way of organized worship, but self-contemplation and the pursuit of enlightenment. Priests of any [[deity]] were welcomed, but followers of the Path and the Way were likely to explain where their deity served in the Celestial Bureaucracy and correct their views of the multiverse.",
        "Inhabitants": "Fewer than half a dozen priests and priestesses tended to the shrine. They passed their time in studies and meditation, and did not proselytize or otherwise seek converts."
