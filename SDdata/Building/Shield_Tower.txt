The '''Shield Tower''' was the headquarters of the [[Shields of Yartar]], the mounted soldiers that defended the city of [[Yartar]] and its trade interests.

==Location==
The tower was located very near the city proper, just opposite the [[River Surbrin]] on its western bank.

==Structure==
While the inner wall stood resolute, the outer wall of the tower had been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times over the years. Beyond the wall, was a fortified bridge that led into the city proper.

Outside the crumbling outer wall were a number of paddocks and animal pens, that served caravaneers passing through the city, along with a well-defended roofed dock. The dock housed the impressive [[Waterbaron's Barge]], the private sea vessel of Yartar's ruler.

==Occupants==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the tower kept a garrison of 150 soldiers.

==Defenses==
Beyond the mounted soldiers and its fortified walls, the Shield Tower was protected by a [[ward]] that was keyed into a number of ''ward tokens''. These ''ward tokens'' were only carried by the Shields' Overswords and the Waterbaron herself. There was also one hanging on the inner gate, to permit townsfolk safe entry, but could be whipped away in case of attack. The Waterbaron had spare tokens locked away in a chest in her chambers.
