        "Description": "The owner of the Sea Chest, [[Tor Grayfell]], had established himself as a master craftsman, producing storage containers of unparalleled quality. His repertoire included intricately crafted sea chests, strongboxes, and coffers, each renowned for its durability and fine detail.\n\nThough Tor's prices are high, his exceptional craftsmanship justified their cost. Known to be reserved, he kept interactions with customers brief and professional, leaving an impression of a man who valued his work as much as his solitude."
