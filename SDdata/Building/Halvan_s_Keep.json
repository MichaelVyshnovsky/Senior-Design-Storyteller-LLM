        "Description": "It was described as an old, rambling manor house enclosed by newer walls, and the origin of the manor house is therefore not known.",
        "History": "After the fall of Halvan the Dark, the [[Council of Seven Burghers]] came to power, and instigated a 50 [[gp]] per head fine on anyone found entering or leaving the keep, in an attempt to keep vandalism and looting under control.\n\nAround [[1338 DR]], adventurers entered the old keep and unleashed a guardian creature that began a fight, and an ensuing fire. The fire blackened the keep and left it without a roof, as well as uncovering rooms that previously lay secret, as well as entry to the dungeons, which were found to be occupied by [[wraith]]s, believed to be [[undead]] incarnations of those locked in the dungeons when the keep was occupied.\n\nThe keep was utilized by a number of organizations since its demise as Halvan's main residence, including followers of [[Loviatar]] and a cabal of smugglers. An attempt to access the keep was made around [[1368 DR]] by the [[Company of the Werebat]], but seven of its eleven members died there.\n\nAccounts of the monsters present at the keep around 1368 DR included [[beholder]]s, [[deepspawn]], [[displacer beast]]s, [[feyr]]s, [[giant centipede]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[mimic]]s, [[minotaur]]s, [[mongrelman|mongrelmen]], and [[troll]]s, as well as the aforementioned wraiths."
