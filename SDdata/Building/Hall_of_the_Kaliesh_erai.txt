The Hall of the Kaliesherai was a building in the elven city of Evereska in the Western Heartlands that was the headquarters of the Kaliesherai, an association of elven psionicists.
A subbasement area of the Hall contained a number of laboratories and vaults holding the groups collection of psionic items, ranging from ordinary power stones to crystal capacitors to potent psicrowns.
The Hall represented the largest collection of psionic lore and knowledge in the surface lands of Faerûn.
In the mid-1370s DR, one young member, Reliath Crescentia, robbed the Hall of a number of powerful items. The theft triggered huge debates among the remaining members, which came to focus on the future of the Kaliesherai and led to a schism between older conservative and younger expansionist elements.
The Hall of the Kaliesherai was rumored to contain cells holding imprisoned psionic monsters—such as couatl, rakshasa, or yuan-ti—that were being studied by the members.
Owing to its collection, the Hall was a potentially tempting target for those would steal from it, or others who rescue or kidnap a captured psionic creature, if the claims were true.
