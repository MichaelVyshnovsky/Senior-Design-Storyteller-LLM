The Traitors Gate stood on the southern side of the park, while the Parkside Gate was on the northern end.\nAfter the city of Phlan was liberated from its monstrous invaders, ruled by the Possessing Spirit in the , the old gate was given the name of the Traitors Gate. The said traitor was infamous Porphyrys Cadorna, a disgraced First Councilman of Phlan who betrayed the trust and respect of the people of Phlan, attempting to seize control after Tyranthraxus defeat. Instead, he became the vessel for the dreaded Possessing Spirit. With his fall, Cadornas pacts with the Zhentarim and other malicious entities became public knowledge. The Traitors Gate was to serve as a reminder of the Cadorna familys disgrace."
