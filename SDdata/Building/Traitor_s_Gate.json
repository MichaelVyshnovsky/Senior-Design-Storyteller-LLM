        "mainbody": "The '''Traitor's Gate''' was an oddly-named inner city gate that separated eastern and western parts of the [[Phlan/Dock District|Dock District]] in [[Phlan]].",
        "Location": "The Traitor's Gate was separated from the [[Parkside Gate]] by the [[Valhegen Park]], erected after the city of [[Old Phlan]] was rebuilt in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The Traitor's Gate stood on the southern side of the park, while the Parkside Gate was on the northern end.",
        "History": "After the city of Phlan was liberated from its monstrous invaders, ruled by the [[Possessing Spirit]] in the {{YearlinkName|1340}}, the old gate was given the name of the Traitor's Gate. The said traitor was infamous [[Porphyrys Cadorna]], a disgraced First Councilman of Phlan who betrayed the trust and respect of the people of Phlan, attempting to seize control after [[Tyranthraxus]]' defeat. Instead, he became the vessel for the dreaded Possessing Spirit. With his fall, Cadorna's pacts with the [[Zhentarim]] and other malicious entities became public knowledge. The Traitor's Gate was to serve as a reminder of the [[Cadorna]] family's disgrace."
