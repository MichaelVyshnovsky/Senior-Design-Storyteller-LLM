The '''Doffed Cloak''' was the sole festhall in [[Halfhap]].

==Services==
The Doffed Cloak had a dance floor and adjoining bar, as well as many comfortable private rooms. The Captain of Halfhap's Garrison, [[Perrin Clovenshield]], gave strict orders to his [[Purple Dragons]] not to overindulge or cause a ruckus, so it was surprisingly free of off-duty soldiers. It was instead mainly attended by locals, traveling merchants, and [[adventurer]]s.
