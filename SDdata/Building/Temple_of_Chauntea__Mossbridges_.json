        "Servies": "This humble temple offered various [[cleric]]al [[spell]]s cast for travelers and other visitors. The service did not come cheap, the base fee was one hundred [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] and it increased by another hundred for each subsequent circle of divine magic cast. The priest's skills were limited to magics of the fist through third circles of divine magic.",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Mossbridges' Temple of Chauntea was run by a [[paladin]] who had fallen out of favor with their previous deity â€“ [[Tyr]], and split from the town's temple dedicated to Grimjaws."
