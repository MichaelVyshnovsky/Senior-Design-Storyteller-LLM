An elevated bonfire rested upon its roof, from which the towers name was derived.\nEvery  along the outer walls of the tower, at a height of , were arrow slits.\nCeilings throughout the tower rooms had ceilings that were over  tall and they were each constructed with an encircling hallway.\nOn the first floor of the tower was an armory, stable, gathering hall, and kitchen. This kitchen had a large chimneyless fireplace, vented through magic, as well as a small spit and double oven. Its shelves were filled with a variety of vegetables and spices. Adjacent to it was a storage room for perishable fruits, vegetables, and meat that were all kept magically cool by a large patch of brown mold.\nOn the second floor of the tower was located the barracks, privy, and an activity room. Here guards practiced, lounged, or played games. The third floor of the tower held the leaders quarters and conference room, as well as seven rooms used for additional storage.\nThe top floor of the tower had large ballista, each mounted upon a rotating wooden disk, positioned at each corner. In the center was a large signal fire, resting atop a  tall elevated platform, with wood soaked in oil. Scattered around the signal fire were four piles of 35 boulders for the fire giants to throw at intruders. And finally, it had a large barbecue pit from which the fire giants would spit-roast whole animal carcasses.\nThe tower was originally built by fire giants as a base to terrorize the surrounding lands. They ruled the area for many years but eventually left.\nThe tower later became populated by Zhentilar, who tethered to it a floating citadel that was known as the Temple in the Sky.
