        "mainbody": "The '''Flaming Tower''', also known as the '''Tower of Flame''', was a massive ruined tower on the northern border of [[Daggerdale]].",
        "Location": "The tower was built on the southern edge of the [[Border Forest]], less than fifteen miles northwest of [[Dagger Falls]].",
        "Structure": "The tower was squat and made of solid black granite. Following the tower's destruction, these walls would be both physically and magically reinforced. An elevated bonfire rested upon its roof, from which the tower's name was derived.\n\nEvery {{SI|10|ft}} along the outer walls of the tower, at a height of {{SI|5|ft}}, were arrow slits.",
        "Interior": "Ceilings throughout the tower rooms had ceilings that were over {{SI|25|ft}} tall and they were each constructed with an encircling hallway.\n\nOn the first floor of the tower was an armory, stable, gathering hall, and kitchen. This kitchen had a large chimneyless fireplace, vented through magic, as well as a small spit and double oven. Its shelves were filled with a variety of vegetables and [[spices]]. Adjacent to it was a storage room for perishable fruits, vegetables, and meat that were all kept magically cool by a large patch of [[brown mold]].\n\nOn the second floor of the tower was located the barracks, privy, and an activity room. Here guards practiced, lounged, or played games. The third floor of the tower held the leader's quarters and conference room, as well as seven rooms used for additional storage.\n\nThe top floor of the tower had large [[ballista]], each mounted upon a rotating wooden disk, positioned at each corner. In the center was a large signal fire, resting atop a {{SI|15|ft}} tall elevated platform, with wood soaked in [[oil]]. Scattered around the signal fire were four piles of 35 boulders for the fire giants to throw at intruders. And finally, it had a large [[barbecue]] pit from which the fire giants would spit-roast whole animal carcasses.",
        "History": "The tower was originally built by [[fire giant]]s as a base to terrorize the surrounding lands. They ruled the area for many years but eventually left.\n\nThe tower later became populated by [[Zhentilar]], who tethered to it a floating citadel that was known as the [[Temple in the Sky]].{{Cite polyhedron/84/The Everwinking Eye: The Schemes of the Zhentarim|19}} In [[1350 DR]] the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], setting its temple loose.\n\n[[Church of Iyachtu Xvim|Xvimlar]] Zhentilar forces reoccupied the ruins of the Flaming Tower, taking over from [[Church of Cyric|Cyricists]] However, the Xvimlar later came into conflict with members of the [[Church of Bane]].\n\nAfter [[Zhentil Keep]] was destroyed by the [[shadovar]] in the [[Shadowbane War]], the Flaming Tower came to be occupied by members of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], who hoped to drive out Daggerdale's [[human]]s.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale}}",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late-14{{th}} century DR, the tower was occupied by over seventy five Zhentarim [[warrior]]s, four magelings, three [[priest]]s, and five fire giants. Around this time it was being overseen by [[Pitsmin Finival]]. They also had about six [[warhorse]]s within their stables around this time."
