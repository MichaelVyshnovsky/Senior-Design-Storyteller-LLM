        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Silver Stars''' was a major temple of [[Selûne]] in the city of [[Silverymoon]].",
        "Geography": "This temple was located in the eastern part of the [[Northbank]] section of Silverymoon. It stood east across from the [[Halls of Inspiration]], north of [[Silverglen]], and west across from the [[Athenaeum of Philosophy]].<ref>",
        "Description": "Constructed of stone, the Temple of Silver Stars was a beautiful structure shaped like a single-spired tiara. The spire of the temple faced the north and, combined with the temple's roofline, formed the shape of a crescent moon that was noticable to all on the nearby streets. And inset within curving stones, the temple sported many crystal-and-silver star windows.",
        "History": "Sometime between [[1368 DR]] and [[1370 DR]], the elderly High Moonmistress of the temple passed away. A period of mourning followed among the members of her temple. The clergy eventually returned to their normal duties and [[Shalyssa Lurialar]] became the temple's new High Moonmistress.\n\nSome time in 1370 DR, under the guidance of their new new High Moonmistress and the urgings of [[Alustriel Silverhand]], High Lady of the [[League of the Silver Marches]], the Temple of Silver Star's clergy became allied with the [[Vault of the Sages]]. Together both worked to aid local [[Heralds of Faerûn|Heralds]], [[Harper]]s, and priests of [[Deneir]] in exploring and [[map]]ping both Silverymoon's surrounding countryside and the borders of the Silver Marches. A duty they continued to do well into [[1372 DR]]. Often times, the Selûnite clergy would hire [[adventurer]]s to escort them in case of marauding monsters.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the High Moonmistress of the Temple of Silver Stars was [[Shanathera Moonsoul]]. After her passing, she was succeeded as leader by Shalyssa Lurialar."
