        "mainbody": "The Temple of Silver Stars was a major temple of Selûne in the city of Silverymoon.\nThis temple was located in the eastern part of the Northbank section of Silverymoon. It stood east across from the Halls of Inspiration, north of Silverglen, and west across from the Athenaeum of Philosophy.\nConstructed of stone, the Temple of Silver Stars was a beautiful structure shaped like a single-spired tiara. The spire of the temple faced the north and, combined with the temples roofline, formed the shape of a crescent moon that was noticable to all on the nearby streets. And inset within curving stones, the temple sported many crystal-and-silver star windows.\nSometime between 1368 DR and 1370 DR, the elderly High Moonmistress of the temple passed away. A period of mourning followed among the members of her temple. The clergy eventually returned to their normal duties and Shalyssa Lurialar became the temples new High Moonmistress.\nSome time in 1370 DR, under the guidance of their new new High Moonmistress and the urgings of Alustriel Silverhand, High Lady of the League of the Silver Marches, the Temple of Silver Stars clergy became allied with the Vault of the Sages. Together both worked to aid local Heralds, Harpers, and priests of Deneir in exploring and mapping both Silverymoons surrounding countryside and the borders of the Silver Marches. A duty they continued to do well into 1372 DR. Often times, the Selûnite clergy would hire adventurers to escort them in case of marauding monsters.\nIn the mid-14 century DR, the High Moonmistress of the Temple of Silver Stars was Shanathera Moonsoul. After her passing, she was succeeded as leader by Shalyssa Lurialar."
