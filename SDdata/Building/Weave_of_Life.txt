The '''Weave of Life''' was a shop in the [[Grand Souk]] marketplace of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]], as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and operated by [[Klevin Van'Sheran]], a [[Tethyrian]] man obsessed with [[Chultan]] culture.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|6}}{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|4}} 

==Description==
The storefront was a large stand with a sign displaying the shop's name in both the [[Chultan language|Chultan]] and [[Common]] tongues. Klevin stood behind the main counter, and greeted customers first in Chultan and then in Common.

==Services==
The shop sold a variety of decorative Chultan [[clothing]]&mdash;lightweight and colorfully patterned [[shirt]]s, [[kilt]]s, [[pants]], and [[sarong]]s&mdash;and a wide range of trade goods, including trinkets, [[ivory]] sculptures, [[jewelry]], and [[scarves]]. The entire inventory evoked local Chultan flavor and had clearly been curated by someone with a love for all things Chult. The shop also sold pamphlets authored by Klevin that discussed topics related to local traditions and customs.

==History==
Klevin had arrived in Chult as an agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]], but he was generally more interested in his business than in the goals of his faction and would take the opportunity to try to sell his wares to any fellow operatives or [[adventurer]]s before engaging in Alliance business.

The Weave of Life was a thriving business by [[1490 DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Over the Edge|6}}{{ToA-time}} The most notable item for sale at this time was a life-size ivory carving of a [[Batiri battlestack]].
