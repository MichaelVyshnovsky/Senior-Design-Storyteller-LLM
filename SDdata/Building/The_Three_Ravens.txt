The Three Ravens was a nobles club in Suzail, Cormyr in the late 15th Century DR.
The club was a small, peaceful, stone-built establishment. It possessed private booths along the backwall.
The Three Ravens provided drinks, and was often sought for quick and private discussions.
This club was considered a seat of power for a group of nobles consolidated under the Lord of House Dauntinghorn.
