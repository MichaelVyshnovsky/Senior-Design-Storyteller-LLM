A Maidens Tears, which was also simply called the Tears, was a tavern that was located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The tavern was located on a small unnamed alley that branched south off of Lion Street in the northeastern section of Waterdeeps North Ward.
The tavern was quiet compared to others located in this part of the North Ward and patrons appreciated its private booths. Zzar was served at a price of 4 cp/jack and wine ranged from the same price upwards of 20 gp per glass for some prized Tashlutan dragonstongue. Complimentary salted crackers, celery, and garlic-and-cheese melt breads were included with every order.
The tavern was named based off of an old Sword Coast legend that stated that the best wine was the tears of a maiden whose suitor was slain.
A Maidens Tears was owned by a quiet woman named Zobia Shrinsha.
