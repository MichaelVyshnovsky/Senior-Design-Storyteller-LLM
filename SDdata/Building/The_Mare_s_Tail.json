        "mainbody": "'''The Mare's Tail''' was a tavern of note in the capital city of [[Cormyr]] â€“ [[Suzale]] as of the mid to late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The Mare's Tail stood two blocks south from Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]], on a street that crossed the [[Court Close]] that laid to the west from the establishment. Travelers who walked along the Court Close from the Promenade moving south needed to turn east once they passed [[Zhaelun's Stockyard]]. Then moving east past the stockyard and two next buildings, they reached the Mare's Tail on the street's northern side. Across from it, to the south, stood [[Taneth's Feasthall]]."
