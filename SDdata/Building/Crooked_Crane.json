        "mainbody": "he Crooked Crane was a tavern and inn located by the city gates of Athkatla.\nThe small inn had two floors, with a balcony on the top floor. The outside had a red mat leading into the inn, and the inn itself had a large lean-to. The taverns sign, which was at the main entrance, was that of its name sake, a warped picture of a bird.\nThe ground floor had a standard bar and stove to the left side, and seating and bookcases to the right. There were a few paintings hanging on the wall. However, there was actually a secret door to the side opposite the entrance, behind the largest painting. Surprisingly, a lich rested in the halls of the secret room, who carried many wands of evocation and a sandthiefs ring. In the chest of this room lay Daystar, an enchanted longsword.\nThe top floor had limited bedding, and several rugs.\nThe bar was frequented by common folk, and avoided by the nobles and landowners of the city. Everyone was considered an equal in the Crooked Crane. The atmosphere was generally friendly, and the door was always open to paying customers.\nUnlike some other taverns, patrons of the Crooked Crane had to serve themselves. There was essentially no table service at all. The lodging was not fancy, and only really catered to those who were poor or desperate. The owner, Groncaner, offered weary wayfarers blankets to sleep in the tavern for only 1 gold piece.\nThe bar only served ale and mead. Around 1368 DR, the ale menu consisted of Bitter Black, Iriaeboran North Brew, Luirens Best, and Tanagyrs Stout.\n* Maunu, an ex-farmer who became a drunkard after his barn burned down.\n* Tiiro and Aulava, lovers who took refuge upstairs.\n* Rilmi, a patron who tried to get involved in Tiiro and Aulavas relationship."
