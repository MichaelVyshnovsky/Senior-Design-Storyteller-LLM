Point Dawn was the easternmost fortress in the chain of the Citadel of the Raven complex. It was named for the fact that it was the first part of the Citadel to feel the suns rays in the morning.
The fortress was dank and uncomforable.
At maximum capacity the fortress could accommodate five hundred soldiers.
