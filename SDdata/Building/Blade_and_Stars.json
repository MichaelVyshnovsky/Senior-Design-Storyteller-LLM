        "Structure": "[[File:AR1300.png|thumb|left|''The Blade and Stars.'']]The long building was four stories high with an attached stable. The kitchens were on one side and the upper-room balconies were on the other. The rooms were tidy and clean. The front lobby hosted a small lounge where guests could meet citizens. Outside, the inn sign displayed a female hand clutching a lightly curved saber and several enchanted stars that twinkled softly. It was rumored the sign was plundered and purchased years ago from a raiding party in [[Amn]].",
        "Atmosphere": "The inn was fairly quiet and sold drinks at moderate prices. Meals were served in guests' rooms rather than a dining room and consisted of regular ale, bread, and fish. The bread could be ordered with cheese or melted eggs. On winter nights, the staff served ruby cordial, a sweet brew of cherries dissolved in sugared red [[wine]].",
        "Rumors": "Local legend stated a female [[yuan-ti]] was trapped within the inn's walls, imprisoned while fighting a [[wizard]]. Rumors said she would finally be released upon his death.",
        "Prices": "* Rooms (included bath, stabling, one free drink, and meals) for 3 [[gp]] per night.\n* Cordial for 3 [[cp]] per goblet.\n* Ale for 3 [[cp]] per tankard.",
        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, regular patrons included [[G'axir|G'axir the Seer]] and [[Elkart]].<ref>\n\nAt some point during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the magical sign of the Blade and Stars was stolen. One Baldurian begger claimed that the thief was Aurayaun, the former innkeeper who had just recently gone missing."
