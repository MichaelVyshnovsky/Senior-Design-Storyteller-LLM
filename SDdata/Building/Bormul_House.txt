'''Bormul House''' was the townhouse of the [[patriar]] [[Bormul]] family of [[Baldur's Gate]], related to the Bormul Dynasty of [[Amn]], located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Manorborn|Manorborn]] neighborhood.

==Location==
The Bormul estate stood on the crossing of two streets, the [[Blackraven Lane]] that ran parallel to the city walls and a street that moved from the [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]] and curved eastward past the Bormul family home.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Structure==
The estate was a tasteful building constructed out of yellow [[granite]] and [[slate]]. Its walls rose three stories tall. The house had a walled garden with its walls wrapped in crawling cream-colored [[rose]]s. The Bormul clan had crypts underneath the townhouse.

==History==
In the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, a distant uncle of the Bormul family visited Bormul House, bringing along a collection of curios. During his visit, the Bormul staff acted in the utmost strangest of ways, later blamed on a widely spread case of [[shellfish]] [[poison]]ing. When the uncle departed, his curiosities were left behind. Not having any storage space, the Bormul staff stashed the strange items in the family crypts underneath the townhouse and quickly forgot about them.
