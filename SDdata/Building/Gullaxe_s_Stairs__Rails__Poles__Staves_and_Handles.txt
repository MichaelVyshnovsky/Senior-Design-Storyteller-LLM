'''Gullaxe's Stairs, Rails, Poles, Staves and Handles''' was the woodshop of [[Ondabar Gullaxe]], one of [[Sundabar]]'s master carpenters who lived within the city during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Services==
Ondabar specialized in wood-turning, making smooth and strong shafts of wood that, upon their initial creation, were perfectly balanced with the [[spear]]head, [[axe]] blade or [[arrow]]head to which it would be attached. He also had a particular knack for assessing the inherent strength and viability of lumber and could almost immediately disregard any pieces with a fault or integral flaw.
