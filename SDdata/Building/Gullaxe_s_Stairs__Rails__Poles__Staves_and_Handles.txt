Gullaxes Stairs, Rails, Poles, Staves and Handles was the woodshop of Ondabar Gullaxe, one of Sundabars master carpenters who lived within the city during the 14 century DR. 
Ondabar specialized in wood-turning, making smooth and strong shafts of wood that, upon their initial creation, were perfectly balanced with the spearhead, axe blade or arrowhead to which it would be attached. He also had a particular knack for assessing the inherent strength and viability of lumber and could almost immediately disregard any pieces with a fault or integral flaw.
