The '''Bat's Roost''' was a tavern in the [[Central Port of Skullport|Central Port]] of [[Skullport]].

==Geography==
The tavern was located in the northwest corner of the Central Port near the [[Pierced Navel]] and [[Gentleman's Groggery]].

==History==
Around [[1366 DR]], [[Schiropts]] won the Bat's Roost tavern after his bat [[familiar]] won a fighting tournament.
