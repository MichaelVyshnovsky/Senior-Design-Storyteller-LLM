The Riven Shield Shop was a business located in Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The building stood two stories tall.
The Riven Shield Shop was located in the northern section of Waterdeeps Trades Ward on the east side of the High Road just south of Selduth Street.
The shop sold armor that was both mundane and magical. An ongoing joke stated that any shields beyond repair were sent over to the Grinning Lion tavern to adorn the walls.
