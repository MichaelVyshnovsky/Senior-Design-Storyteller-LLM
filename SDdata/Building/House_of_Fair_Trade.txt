The '''House of Fair Trade''' was a temple in the small frontier city of [[Nesmé]] dedicated to [[Waukeen]], that at times acted as the seat of government for the town's theocratic leadership.{{Cite web/The City of Nesmé}}

==Location==
This building was situated in the center of Nesmé.

==Structure==
This building stood four stories tall, was made of stone, and had a circular shape. It had a peaked roof, what some would describe as spired, supported by wooden beams.

==Interior==
On the top floor of the temple was a room utilized by the town's leadership. A long stone table adorned it, along with twelve worn chairs and small glass windows.

Inside one of the temple's chambers was a [[portal]] that led to an unknown location in [[Silverymoon]]. This was used by [[Alustriel Silverhand|Lady Alustriel]] to send [[adventurer]]s and resources to help the city.

==History==
Following the disappearance of Waukeen and the decline of her church during the [[Time of Troubles]], this temple was converted into a boarding hall for merchants. Later, following the goddess's return, the building experienced some resurgence as a Waukeenar temple.

When Nesmé was later sacked in [[1370 DR]] by [[troll]]s, this temple was one of the few buildings left untouched.{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|19}}

==Inhabitants==
This temple was primarily operated by the high priestess [[Jygil Zelnathra]].
