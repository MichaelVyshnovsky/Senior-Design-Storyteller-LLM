The House of Fair Trade was a temple in the small frontier city of Nesmé dedicated to Waukeen, that at times acted as the seat of government for the towns theocratic leadership.
This building was situated in the center of Nesmé.
This building stood four stories tall, was made of stone, and had a circular shape. It had a peaked roof, what some would describe as spired, supported by wooden beams.
On the top floor of the temple was a room utilized by the towns leadership. A long stone table adorned it, along with twelve worn chairs and small glass windows.
Inside one of the temples chambers was a portal that led to an unknown location in Silverymoon. This was used by Lady Alustriel to send adventurers and resources to help the city.
Following the disappearance of Waukeen and the decline of her church during the Time of Troubles, this temple was converted into a boarding hall for merchants. Later, following the goddesss return, the building experienced some resurgence as a Waukeenar temple.
When Nesmé was later sacked in 1370 DR by trolls, this temple was one of the few buildings left untouched.
This temple was primarily operated by the high priestess Jygil Zelnathra.
