The Black Boot was a dangerous inn found in Westgate in 1358 DR.
The Black Boot was located near the River Bridge in the far east section of the city on Rivergate Way.
The accommodations of the Black Boot were poor but the prices were cheap, attracting a motley crowd. Brawls and murders were a nightly occurrence here.
