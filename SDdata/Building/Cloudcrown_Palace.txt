Cloudcrown Palace was a palace in the elven city of Evereska. It was a place of mighty defensive magics and ancient towers.
It was located in the northwestern area of the city, just a bit ways east of Cloudcrown Hill.
The palace was one of the finest example of Evereskas "naturist" architecture. Although built of stone, the palace was fashioned to resembled a stand of huge bluetop trees, standing so close together that their boles had grown into one another. Carvings on the walls to give the impression of bark were so accurate that a trained sculptor could not guess it to be stone. 
In the , Cloudcrown Palace was damaged during the phaerimm attack on Evereska. Despite the damage done, the palace remained standing for well over a century and a half later.
