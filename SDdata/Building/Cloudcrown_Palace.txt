'''Cloudcrown Palace''' was a palace in the [[elven]] city of [[Evereska]]. It was a place of mighty defensive magics and ancient towers.

==Location==
It was located in the northwestern area of the city, just a bit ways east of [[Cloudcrown Hill]].

==Structure==
The palace was one of the finest example of Evereska's "naturist" architecture. Although built of stone, the palace was fashioned to resembled a stand of huge [[bluetop]] trees, standing so close together that their boles had grown into one another. Carvings on the walls to give the impression of bark were so accurate that a trained sculptor could not guess it to be stone. 

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Cloudcrown Palace was damaged during the [[phaerimm]] attack on Evereska. Despite the damage done, the palace remained standing for well over a [[1479 DR|century and a half later]].
