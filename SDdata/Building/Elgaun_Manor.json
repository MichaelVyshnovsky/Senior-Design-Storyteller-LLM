        "mainbody": "lgaun Manor was a grand estate in Tegals Mark that served as the summer home to a wealthy Sembian family from Yhaunn.\nThe facade of the manor was heavily windowed and its amenities included an indoor pool. \nWhile the family from Sembia occupied the house during the summer, it was tended to in winter months by a local Tassadran couple.\nThe family from Sembia often used the manor to host parties for their southern neighbors, hiring mages to delight the guests with illusions, as well as minstrels and bards to entertain with music. Their celebrations could last for days and involved pranks, accidents, and occasionally murder. \nOn one occasion, two rival mages flew around Tegals Hill throwing fireballs at one another. This incident garnered the attention of the Grand Mairshar, who asked that she be given a warning before the next soir√©e, for fear of terrifying the townsfolk of the Mark."
