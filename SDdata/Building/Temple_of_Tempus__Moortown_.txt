The unnamed '''temple of Tempus''' in [[Moortown]] was a former site of worship dedicated to [[Tempus]], As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the building lay in ruins.

==Location==
[[File:Moortown-DunMag53.png|thumb|320px|''A sketch of Moortown ''circa'' 1369 DR with the temple ruins labelled as 2.'']]The building sat in the center of Moortown not far off [[Dead Man's Walk]]. It was just north of the [[Swamphouse Inn]].{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|62}}

==Structure==
The temple was made of stone and contained a stone statue of Tempus. It also had a basement accessible via a trapdoor. 

By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the ruined temple was strewn with rubble, bone, and bits of fur, and the statue had lost its head.

==Activities==
The temple's [[cleric]]s had maintained a large cache of healing items in the basement, including ''[[potions of healing]]'', ''[[scroll|scrolls of]] [[cure critical wounds]]'' and ''[[cure disease]]'', [[jar]]s of ''[[Keoghtom's ointment]]'', and a ''[[rod of resurrection]]''. Much of this was left behind when the temple was abandoned.

==History==
[[File:Red wyrmlings - DunMag53.png|thumb|400px|''The tree red dragon wyrmlings play with the head of the statue of Tempus.'']]When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] established an outpost in Moortown in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, it became a base for a number of the Cult's [[dragon]] allies. Early in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, three [[red dragon]]s were hatched in the town&mdash;offspring of the Cult's allies, [[Wyndfire]] and [[Snizzler]]&mdash;and the temple was turned into a nursery for them. When their parents were away, these [[wyrmling]]s were looked after by another red dragon&mdash;[[Flameshoot]]&mdash;and by a [[human]] guard named [[Mristin]], whom the hatchlings had been instructed to obey. 

The wyrmlings spent much of days quarreling loudly and playing with the head of the temple's Tempus statue. They would wander out of the building to investigate if they smelled an intruder. Much of the Cult of the Dragon prescience in Moortown was oriented toward protecting them, and the Cultists had taken precautions to clear the temple of anything that could threaten them.
