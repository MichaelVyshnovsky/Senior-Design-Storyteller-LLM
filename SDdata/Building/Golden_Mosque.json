        "Structure": {
            "Minarets": "[[Image:CallToPrayer.JPG|thumb|right|75px|''A call to prayer from the minarets.'']]\nAs tall as the Golden Mosque was, it was dwarfed by the four minarets that surrounded it, each towering {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} into the air. These minarets were also plated with gold. Priests called the faithful to prayer from atop the minarets. The minarets were enchanted to project the call to prayer across the entire breadth of Huzuz.\n\nThe insides of the minarets sweltered from the intense daytime sun, though they were noticeably cooler closer toward the top. Priests had to climb 451 steep steps to reach the uppermost chambers of the minarets. The tops of the minarets actually shifted back and forth with the strong breezes.\n\nThe uppermost chambers were enchanted so that anyone speaking from here could magically project their voice across the entire city of Huzuz. In [[1366 DR]], a noble foolishly abused this power to express his love for a maiden. Outraged by this sacrilege, the public demanded the noble's death. The Keeper of the Mosques was able to quiet them down by having the young man perform three impossible tasks that became legend when he was able to accomplish the feats. Imam [[Renn min Zann]] married the couple shortly thereafter. It was considered sacrilegious to use the minarets for any other purpose. Anyone caught doing so later had their vocal cords removed. The minaret would then have to be re-sanctified.",
            "Grounds": "[[Image:GoldenMosque.JPG|thumb|right|250px|''A map of the Golden Mosque and surrounding grounds.'']]\nThe walled grounds surrounding the magnificent structure measured approximately {{SI|360|ft|long=yes}} wide and {{SI|270|ft|long=yes}} in length. The grounds of the Golden Mosque were decorated with pear and date trees, and a wide variety of bushes and flowers. These plants were in bloom throughout the year thanks to [[divine magic]]. Pilgrims to the Golden Mosque were given a seed, bulb, or fruit to take home with them and share with their family. Many of these pilgrims returned to the Golden Mosque years later bearing additional seeds from their initial gift, continuing the cycle of life for the trees."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "Many wealthy and well-known citizens of Huzuz came to the Golden Mosque to pray, including the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]].\n\nImam Renn min Zann was the Keeper of the Mosques in 1367 DR, though he shared much of his responsibilities with [[Turam min Kor]]. The pair of them decided on which priests of other mosques would be allowed to preach within the Golden Mosque.\n\nThe priests who lived within the grounds of the Golden Mosque took their meals daily in the open courtyard come rain or shine, though the divine magic keeping the vegetation in bloom throughout the year also ensured they always had a good dining experience.",
        "Activities": "The Golden Mosque was dedicated to the worship of all of the Enlightened gods of Zakhara. Services were held at dawn, the second hour, the fourth hour, noon, the second hour in the afternoon, the hour before dusk, at dusk, and at midnight. Each service was usually attended by thousands of worshipers.\n\nSince all Enlightened Zakharans were expected to take a pilgrimage to the Golden Mosque at some point during their lives, the citizens of Huzuz, living in close proximity to the Mosque, began several pilgrimage traditions. When citizens were twelve years old, they were taken to the Golden Mosque on [[Ascension Day]]. When citizens turned sixteen years of age, they took an official pilgrimage visit to the Mosque on the Grand Caliph's birthday."
