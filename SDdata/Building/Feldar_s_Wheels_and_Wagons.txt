Feldars Wheels and Wagons was a wainwright shop located in Sundabar during the mid-14 century DR. It was owned and run by an eccentric master carpenter named Ildar Feldar. 
A true perfectionist, Ildar would take months to craft his masterpieces, not allowing even a single imperfection in his work. He specialized in elaborate ornamental carvings that would adorn grand coaches.
