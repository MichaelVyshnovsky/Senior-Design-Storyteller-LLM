'''Feldar's Wheels and Wagons''' was a wainwright shop located in [[Sundabar]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and run by an eccentric master carpenter named [[Ildar Feldar]]. 

A true perfectionist, Ildar would take months to craft his masterpieces, not allowing even a single imperfection in his work. He specialized in elaborate ornamental carvings that would adorn grand coaches.
