        "mainbody": "'''Thessarelle's Platter''' was one of the most high-class restaurants in [[Suzail]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The establishment was sometimes referred to as '''Thessarelle's''', but referring to it as \"The Platter\" was considered undignified.",
        "Atmosphere": "While still a posh establishment, many considered Thessarelle's to have fallen out of fashion by the late 1470s DR.\n\nThessarelle's unfashionability often left it mostly empty, making for a much more peaceable and affordable posh dining experience. As a consequence, it was frequented by highly ranked courtiers, visiting [[Common_dictionary#O|outlander]]s, and rich Cormyreans who that possessed neither titles nor ambitions to rise through the hierarchies.\n\nThe proprietress, [[Thessarelle]], was known to be haughty and proud. Her staff were likewise well-mannered and conducted their job with much grace.",
        "History": "Around {{YearlinkName|1479}}, several Cormyrean nobles were looking to weaken King [[Foril Obarskyr I|Foril's]] court, even if it meant disposing of incorruptible officials like the Lady [[Clerk of the Rolls]], [[Rensharra Ironstave]]. Thessarelle's was the site of one such assassination attempt, and it would have succeeded too, were it not for [[Mirt|Mirt the Moneylender]].",
        "Food and drink": "Apart from the general fare found in such Cormyrean restaurants, Thessarelle's offered [[wine]]s, fried hocks-and-tongues, [[boar]], and dishes based on [[potato]]es."
