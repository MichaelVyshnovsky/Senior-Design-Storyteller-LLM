        "mainbody": "hessarelles Platter was one of the most high-class restaurants in Suzail in the late 15 century DR. The establishment was sometimes referred to as Thessarelles, but referring to it as \"The Platter\" was considered undignified.\nWhile still a posh establishment, many considered Thessarelles to have fallen out of fashion by the late 1470s DR.\nThessarelles unfashionability often left it mostly empty, making for a much more peaceable and affordable posh dining experience. As a consequence, it was frequented by highly ranked courtiers, visiting outlanders, and rich Cormyreans who that possessed neither titles nor ambitions to rise through the hierarchies.\nThe proprietress, Thessarelle, was known to be haughty and proud. Her staff were likewise well-mannered and conducted their job with much grace.\nAround , several Cormyrean nobles were looking to weaken King Forils court, even if it meant disposing of incorruptible officials like the Lady Clerk of the Rolls, Rensharra Ironstave. Thessarelles was the site of one such assassination attempt, and it would have succeeded too, were it not for Mirt the Moneylender.\nApart from the general fare found in such Cormyrean restaurants, Thessarelles offered wines, fried hocks-and-tongues, boar, and dishes based on potatoes."
