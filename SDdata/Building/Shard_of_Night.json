        "Description": "This bleak tower of black stone was floating above a cluster of apartments in the River District. It seemed to have been sheared off at its base when it was torn from its original location.\n\nThe Shard of Night had the ability to \"eat\" shadows and darkness, and creatures that walked under the tower in daylight had their shadows temporarily absorbed by the tower. At night, the tower cast its ominous shadow over the River District if there was moonlight. Neverwintans avoided the place for this reason.\n\nInside the tower there was located a [[teleportation circle]], originally connected to a [[Netherese]] camp near [[Xinlenal]]. To enter the tower from the outside, a keyword spoken out loud at night could create stairs of solidified shadows.\n\nAfter the tower was purified by [[Selûne]], in [[1479 DR]], it was returned to its original appearance of alabaster stone, and the stairs conjured by the keyword were of solidified moonlight instead.",
        "History": "Around [[1379 DR]], Netherese forces attacked [[Moonshadow Hall]] and tore apart one of its towers, sending it to the Shadowfell, where the tower was warped by the shadowy realm. Later experiments allowed the Netherese to control where and how the tower manifested in the [[Prime Material plane|mortal realms]].\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the Netherese took advantage of the magical chaos to send the Shard of Night to Neverwinter, with the intention of using it to further their plans in the area when needed. This tower was later renamed \"the Shard of Night\" by the Neverwintans.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Netherese were using the Shard to spy on Neverwinter. One of their agents in Evernight, [[Kaross]], slew any Neverwintans who learned of their operations.\n\nIn 1479 DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s seeking the ''[[Shards of Selûne]]'' raided the Shard of Night, defeating the guards there and allowing Lady [[Jasmine (priest)|Jasmine]] and other selûnite priests to recover the tower. The Shard of Night was later purified, reconsecrated to Selûne by using the power of the ''Shards'', and became a beacon of hope in Neverwinter. The Neverwintans began to call it \"the Shard of the Moon\" afterwards.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|42}}"
