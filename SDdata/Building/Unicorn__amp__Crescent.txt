The Unicorn & Crescent was an inn located in Evereska.
This inn welcomed many goodly organizations, such as Harpers, the Heralds of Faer√ªn, and even the Chosen of Mystra.
In the 1360s DR, Volothamp Geddarm could not visit such an establishment, and thus could not give it score it on his famed rating system.
