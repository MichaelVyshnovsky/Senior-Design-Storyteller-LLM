        "mainbody": "rlhos Fine Flasks was an exceptional brewery and winery located in Ashabenford.\nSituated on the north of the Moonsea Ride as it passed through Ashabenford, Arlhos Fine Flasks was one of many shops dotting the route.\nSelling ales and wines of quality rivalling those found in Cormyr, Sembia or The Vast, Arlhos drinks were quickly snatched up by many travelling merchants. However he was known to manage the production of his goods so that local Mistrans were never without drink. Of particular note was Arlhos Ashaben Ale and the proudly recommended Black Boot Stout or the green grape wine, Pearls of the Moon."
