The Phoenix Tower was the tower of the mage Tenthar Taerhamoos in the mid–8 century DR.
There was a cellar and kitchens.
The place was dark and cool.
The fortress had a chasm dug by golems, a ring of thick thorns, and jagged rubble around it by , when the golems fell apart due to the chaos of the Art. The wooden doors were old at the time, but held well, once barred. The archmage also had a spelltale placed upon some portals, warning him if anyone used them.
In the , the archmage of Phoenix Tower, Tenthar Taerhamoos, holed up in the Phoenix Tower in response to the chaos of the Art that had arisen. He remained there for about three tendays, before leaving to head for the House of the Ladystar and then in response to a spelltale that told him elves had used a portal to go from Tangletrees to somewhere else.
