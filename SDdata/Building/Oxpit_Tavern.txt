The '''Oxpit Tavern''' was one of the most well-known,

==Location==
It was located in near the west side of Mulmaster, within or near the city's [[Mulmaster/Docks Quarter|Docks Quarter]].

==Interior==
There was little to note about the interior decoration of the tavern, a fact that did very little to take away from its tremendous popularity.

===Atmosphere===
The tavern was a raucous place, where someone could just as readily get into a fistfight with their fellow patrons as they would in joining in a bawdy tavern song.

==Services==
The Oxpit offered rooms for rent, at a cost of 7 [[gp]] per day, along with ample servings of roasted [[ox]] meat along with generously-poured [[mug]]s of [[ale]].

As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Oxpit was run by [[Cyril]], a friendly but exuberant man who was just as generous with information as he was with drink.

==History==
While enjoying tremendous success ''circa'' the {{yearlinkName|1491}}, the Oxpit tavern became the target of a spree of vandalism. After the tavern's owner [[Chroomeg]] requested the [[City Watch (Melvaunt)|City Watch]] investigate the issue, at which they failed miserably, he hired on some mercenaries to act as tavern guards.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|20}} The vandals were actually a number of [[giant badger]]s dug up through the tavern's cellar, under the influence of a cultist of the [[Cult of the Black Earth|Black Earth]].{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|22}} The [[druid]] of the [[Emerald Enclave]] [[Seranolla]] became trapped in the cellar investigating the matter, but was rescued by a band of adventurers.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|21}}

==Inhabitants==
[[Branislav Semyon]] was a regular patron of the Oxpit tavern and used it as a meeting place for his assassination contracts.
