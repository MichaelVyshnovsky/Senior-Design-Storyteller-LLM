Zymorven Hall was a stone keep located in the Rauvin Vale in Luruar. It was owned and kept by the Zymorven family of Silverymoon, who used to to keep an eye on the surrounding lands for decades.
The keep was commanded by Lord Harthos Zymorven as of the late 15 century DR.
The keep sat upon a steep bluff, situated between the Moonwood and Evermoors, that granted a unobstructed view of the Rauvin Road.
Constructed from mortared stone, Zymorven Hall featured a high-pitch roof. This roof was decorated with a number of wooden statues carved into the shape of growling wolves. Near the main keep was a small gatehouse that connected to a fortified wall.
The interior of the keep was lined with oak-wood panels and decorated with mounted weapons and suits of armor. Although it wasnt outwardly apparent, many of these armaments were magically animated under the authority of Lord Zymorven.
The lord of the keep made sure his staff offered hospitality to soldiers who rode along the Rauvin Road.
Among the halls staff were a stableman, a cook, a clerk, a troubadour as well a druidic witch who served as an apothecary.
