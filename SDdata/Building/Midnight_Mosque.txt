The Midnight Mosque was a mosque dedicated to Hajama in Liham, in 1367 DR.
The Midnight Mosque had a splendid view over Al-Sari River. A single narrow trail was the only way into the mosque.
This mosque was made from black granite, providing ample shielding from Zakharas punishing heat. 
The interior of the mosque was decorated with basalt statues that drew visitors. Black marble inlaid with onyx and black jade covered the floor.
The vast majority of priests worshiping here were ethoists. A few pragmatists gained the beneficial attention of the caliph.
