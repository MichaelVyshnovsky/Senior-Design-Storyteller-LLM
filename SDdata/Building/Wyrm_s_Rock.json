        "mainbody": "yrms Rock was a island-fortress located in the city of Baldurs Gate, that served as one of the headquarters of the Flaming Fist military.\nIt was located on an isle in the middle of the River Chionthar, at the center of Wyrms Crossing.\nWyrms Rock was an imposing and formidable stronghold. Its granite walls were a foot (0.3 m) thick and worn smooth from the near-constant rain and splashing from the river water. The only features were a number of arrow slits that faced outward towards the water.\nDrawbridges extended from either side of the Rock, to the massive stone bridges of Wyrms crossing. Aside from a small set of steel stairs leading up from diminutive dock, these were the only entrances in and out of the keep. In fact, all overland traffic that crossed the river at this point was forced through this well-guarded fortress.\nThe first floor of Wyrms Rock was an imposing gauntlet for anyone who passed through. It was little more than a stone tunnel, standing atop big rock high above crashing waves, beset by room likely filled with men armed to the teeth. In fact these were offices for the toll-gatherers and chambers for the guards. The ground floor was marked with a hanging wooden sign emblazoned with the logo of the Flaming Fist.\nAbove the main tunnel was the keeps armory. It was well-stocked with all manner of weapons used to defend it from land, naval and even aerial assaults. The top floor of Wyrms Rock served as the quarters for the officers and mercenaries that served within. \nDug into the isle, beneath the level of Wyrms Crossing, was the Rocks spacious dungeons. While it did include a holding cell, that were used in emergency situations only, it was really more of a storage area used to house equipment such as canoes.\nThe fortress of Wyrms Rock served two main roles for the city of Baldurs Gate. First and foremost it was bulwark that protected the city from the sea. The other was as a toll-collecting site, at a cost of 5 cp, for all travelers headed north along the Trade Way.\nThe fort was only manned during daylight hours. At night, the drawbridges were raised and overland traffic was halted until first light next morning.\nAs expected, Wyrms Rock was extremely well-defended. The Flaming Fist soldiers stationed within were equipped with vats of oil, massive rocks, javelins and projectile weapons. They could fire these out murder-holes and arrow slits while being protected behind walls of thick granite.\nWhile Wyrms Rock had enough accommodations for about 100 members of the Flaming Fist, it typically housed between 25 to 50 soldiers.\nIt was believed that the isle of Wyrms Rock was originally home to a bronze dragon.\nThe dungeon of Wyrms Rock was used to confine the patriar sympathizers of Duke Valarken, during his attempted take over Baldurs Gate, in the mid-15 century DR."
