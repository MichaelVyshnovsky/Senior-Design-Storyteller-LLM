Uwaji Castle was the fortress of the shogun of Wa.
The castle was located in the city of Uwaji on the island of Tsukishima.
The massive and beautiful complex was large enough to almost be considered a small town in its own right. The grounds contained pagodas and shrines, a peach orchard, an art museum, an amphitheater, and, of course, the Palace of Imperial Prosperity, where the shogun lived.
The castle was heavily defended. At all times, there were 175 mounted samurai on duty and 450 more on foot. Additionally, there were 400 bushi on guard.
Drawing any weapon on the castle grounds, except in defense of the capital, was a crime punishable by death.
In Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR), the shogun living within the castles confines was Matasuuri Nagahide. The castles administrative duties were handled by the rusui.
Around the year 1675 (1257 DR), Lord Hayo Nuraiyi visited the castle and was speaking with a superior officer. The officer insulted Nuraiyis parents, and Nuraiyi drew his sword to defend their honor and wounded his superior. Nuraiyi was forced to commit seppuku for drawing a weapon on the castle grounds. His death left his 33 samurai as ronin. Four years later, the 33 ronin invaded the home of the superior and murdered him and all his samurai to honor their former master. They then voluntarily gave themselves over to the authorities and committed seppuku themselves. A century later, the 33 ronin were still considered local heroes.
When the capital of Wa was moved from Iiso to Uwaji in Wa Year 1663 (1245 DR), Matasuuri Shogoro found that the previous owners of the castle had let it fall into disrepair. The roof leaked, stones were missing from the parapets, and the gardens were full of weeds. He summoned six daimyo from nearby provinces to make the needed repairs.
