The '''Temple of the Yuir Gods''' was an ancient temple found in the [[Yuirwood]] that was transported away from the [[Prime Material plane]] to the [[Feywild]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|4}} It was a place of worship dedicated to the [[Yuir pantheon]].

==Structure==
The temple was formed out of group of trees that stood upon a hill in the Yuirwood.

==Interior==
The entrance hall of the temple was adorned with four, uniquely crafted, statues of the old Yuir gods: [[Elikarashae]], [[Magnar]] the Bear, [[Zandilar]] the Dancer, and [[Relkath of the Infinite Branches]]. These statues appeared not be crafted from stone or metal, but rather grown upward from the temple's floor.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|21}}

Just beyond the entranceway was the temple's ossuary. Within the heart of the temple was the thrice-twined tree.

===Atmosphere===
Motes of light floated throughout the temple, providing ample illumination within.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|17}}

==Activities==
The [[star elves]] of the Yuirwood used the temple as a place of worship, but also as the holy site within which they could inter their dead.

==History==
Some time ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} the [[cult of Voldini]] uncovered the ancient [[fey]] document, the ''[[Tome of Twilight Boughs]]'', which outlined a ritual that could bring back the temple to Toril. They had the ultimate goal of returning the Yuir pantheon to prominence in the Realms.

The cultists led by [[Berrain Truescourge]] ultimately proved successful in their efforts, and completed the ritual,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|13}} inadvertently corrupting nearby fey, such as [[pixie]]s and [[dryad]]s, in the Yuirwood.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|8}}

The same night the temple returned, a group of [[adventurer]]s returned the temple to the Feywild and protected the fey of the Yuirwood from utter corruption. They accomplished this feat by implanting a crystal imbued life force of a noble fey that sacrificed their life, within the temple's thrice-twined tree.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|22-23}}
