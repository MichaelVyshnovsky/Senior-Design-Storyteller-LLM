The Hall of Ashes was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Hall of Ashes held the interred remains of the Grand Caliphs of Huzuz. The remains of each Grand Caliph were stored within an urn made from solid red gold. The Hall of Ashes was open to the public, but the urns were kept safely behind walls of force.
Seven hand-picked mamluks guarded the Hall of Ashes at all times. They were well-equipped with magical weapons and armor.
The remains of all but two Grand Caliphs were kept here. Both of these Grand Caliphs were fighting battles far from Huzuz when they were slain and their remains were never recovered.
A terrible curse was believed to attach itself to anyone who dared disturb the resting place of the Grand Caliphs.
