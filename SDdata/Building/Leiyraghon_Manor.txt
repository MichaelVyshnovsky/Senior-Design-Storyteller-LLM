Leiyraghon Manor was the sprawling ancestral seat of the powerful House Leiyraghon in Melvaunt around 1367 DR.
The mansion was located in the southeastern corner of Melvaunt.
The Leiyraghon family occasionally opened up the castle to the public to host tourneys and display their power.
Twenty four private men-at-arms-guarded the castle at all times.
