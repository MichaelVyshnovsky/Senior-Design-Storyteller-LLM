        "Location": "The shop was located on [[Waterdeep Way]] very close to its junction with the [[High Road]]. It was on the north side of the road next door to the [[Jade Jug]].",
        "Services": "This shop sold the various ordinary items found in ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' alongside a number of [[magic item]]s, but the latter had to be made-to-order or transported to the shop and thus had an expected delivery time of 10–30 days. Home deliveries could be made within the Castle Ward, using the shop's own coach.",
        "Staff": "In the mid-1360s [[DR]], [[Cathal Sunspear]] worked here as a counter clerk and [[Xanatrar Hillhorn]] was the service-mage. There were also four guards who worked shifts of two and two, plus a team of six delivery people."
