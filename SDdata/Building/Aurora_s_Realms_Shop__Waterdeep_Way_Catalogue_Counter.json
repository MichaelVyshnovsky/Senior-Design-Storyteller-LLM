        "mainbody": "uroras Realms Shop, Waterdeep Way Catalogue Counter was an outlet of the Auroras Emporium chain in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep in the mid–14 century DR. It was one of six such outlets in the city.\nThe shop was located on Waterdeep Way very close to its junction with the High Road. It was on the north side of the road next door to the Jade Jug.\nThis shop sold the various ordinary items found in Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue alongside a number of magic items, but the latter had to be made-to-order or transported to the shop and thus had an expected delivery time of 10–30 days. Home deliveries could be made within the Castle Ward, using the shops own coach.\nIn the mid-1360s DR, Cathal Sunspear worked here as a counter clerk and Xanatrar Hillhorn was the service-mage. There were also four guards who worked shifts of two and two, plus a team of six delivery people."
