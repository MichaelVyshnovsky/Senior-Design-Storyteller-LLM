The Mosque of Najm the Adventurous was located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This temple could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
A large worship area allowed worshipers of Najm to regale other followers with tales of adventure. Showrooms housed rare treasures brought back from these adventures.
High Priest Imam Effat was the head of the mosque. He supervised around 200 lesser ranking priests of Najm and other laymen.
Followers of Najm were encouraged to explore the world and bring back tales of their exploits.
Items held in the showrooms included a spelljammer helm, an emerald from a palace from Kara-Tur, a stuffed beholder, a shield of a Purple Dragon, a red robe from a land called Thay, and a statue of a wizard named Elminster.
Divination magic was practiced here and could be cast for a fee.
Followers of Najm were encouraged to prove their faith by crossing a small pit on a walkway that was only several inches wide. True followers performed the feat while blind-folded.
