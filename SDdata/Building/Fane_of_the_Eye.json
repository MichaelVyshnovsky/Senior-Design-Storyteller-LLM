        "mainbody": "The '''Fane of the Eye''' was a large cavern complex deep under the [[Dessarin Valley]]. It was centered around a black ziggurat temple built by renegade [[drow]] and dedicated to the [[Elder Elemental Eye]]. Many prisoners were kept here, including [[Balix]].\n\nThe cult that built it eventually died out or were hunted by drow loyal to [[Lolth]]. The complex remained abandoned until [[Vizeran DeVir]] found it and used it to forge the weapons ''[[Ironfang (war pick)|Ironfang]]'', ''[[Drown]]'', ''[[Tinderstrike]]'', and ''[[Windvane]]''. He left the weapons there until the Fane of the Eye was found in [[1491 DR]] by the latest incarnation of the [[Cult of Elemental Evil]].<ref>"
