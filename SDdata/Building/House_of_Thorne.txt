The House of Thorne was a dilapidated old mansion in Waterdeeps Sea Ward.  
The home was named for the thorn vines that grew on its walls.
Around 1079 DR, the House of Thorne was the site on which the Circle of Skulls attempted the ritual of the First Flensing. In 1480 DR, noblewoman and wizard Rilyanna Saerfynn attempted to complete the ritual in the houses basement but was killed by Quessahn Uthraebor.
