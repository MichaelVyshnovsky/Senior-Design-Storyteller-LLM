The '''House of Thorne''' was a dilapidated old mansion in [[Waterdeep|Waterdeep's]] [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]].  

==Structure==
The home was named for the thorn vines that grew on its walls.

==History==
Around [[1079 DR]], the House of Thorne was the site on which the [[Circle of Skulls]] attempted the [[ritual]] of the [[First Flensing]]. In [[1480 DR]], noblewoman and [[wizard]] [[Rilyanna Saerfynn]] attempted to complete the ritual in the house's basement but was killed by [[Quessahn Uthraebor]].
