The '''Hand That Swings the Sword''' was a shrine to [[Tempus]], Lord of Battles, situated in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Priests at the shrine sometimes directed visiting fellows with healing powers who needed coin to go to [[The Bent Helm]] tavern. They could work in the tavern's back room to patch up knife wounds during the constant brawls there. This was lucrative: the usual fee for a [[spell]] was a 1000 [[gp]].
