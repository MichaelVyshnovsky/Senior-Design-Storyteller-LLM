        "mainbody": "The '''Crypt of the Six''' was one of many [[Anauria]]n tombs littered throughout the [[Serpent Hills]]. It housed the bodies of multiple counselors and their families and contained a number of magical guardians, along with a path forcing travelers to wander the [[Abyss]] before delving deeper. Because of these defenses, it was one of the few tombs in the area to never be looted."
