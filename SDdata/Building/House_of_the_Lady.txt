The '''House of the Lady''' was a temple to [[Selûne]] standing at the top of [[Spring Hill]] in [[Immersea]], [[Cormyr]].<ref>

==History==
The priestess [[Lleddew]] adventured with [[Cole Wyvernspur]] to gain treasure to complete the building of the temple.<ref>

==Description==
The House of the Lady was a simple yet elaborate temple. The temple was more like a shrine. A circle of pillars supported a domed roof, inset with diamonds.<ref> There were no walls and a spring-fed pool occupied the center of the structure.<ref>

The [[Immer Stream]] issued from the hill and flowed down in cascades, known as Selûne's Stair. It was said that if one climbed to the top of the cataracts in the full moonlight, they would gain their heart's desire.<ref>

==Defenses==
The temple was guarded by a [[Shards|Shard]].<ref>
