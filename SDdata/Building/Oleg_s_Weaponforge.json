He was well-known for making longswords and bastard swords that often struck more accurately than other blades, if only for a certain time.\nDespite the high caliber of his work, Oleg was often ridiculed by the local townsfolk and his forge attracted few local patrons. He did find steady clientele from among the adventurers that passed through Daggerford."
