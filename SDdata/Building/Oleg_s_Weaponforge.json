        "Location": "It was located in the town's [[Caravan Quarter]]{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}",
        "Services": "The [[half-orc]] [[Oleg]] crafted quality armaments including those that were required by mounted fighters. He was well-known for making [[longsword]]s and [[bastard sword]]s that often struck more accurately than other blades, if only for a certain time.\n\nDespite the high caliber of his work, Oleg was often ridiculed by the local townsfolk and his forge attracted few local patrons. He did find steady clientele from among the [[adventure]]rs that passed through Daggerford."
