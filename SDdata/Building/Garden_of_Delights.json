        "mainbody": "he Garden of Delights was a special domed building located in the great fortress of Sarahin.\nThe Garden of Delights was located deep within the Haunted Lands of Zakhara in Sarahin.\nThis large dome was constructed of black stone. The stone was an illusion conjured by Ibrihim, a deceiver genie. The illusion concealed a beautiful garden enclosed in glassteel.\nThe entrance to the garden was located underground, accessible only through a secret passage found in the Hall of Audience.\nThough the garden was enhanced by further illusions cast by Ibrihim, it was a paradise to those admitted. Succulent fruit adorned the trees, wondrous animals roamed the garden, and the stream was filled with nectar.\nA rose-colored pavilion with pillars embedded with lapis lazuli served as a place for sleeping initiates.\nInitiates of the Everlasting were taken to the garden to get a taste of what awaited them after a life of devout service. Beautiful men and women called huriye waited on them, fulfilling any desire.\nTwo mute jann guarded the entrance to the garden, protecting it from everyone except the Shadow Caliph, Batina al-Shaat, and Ibrihim.\nWhen abandoned, six giant cobras roamed the garden, attacking anyone who might intrude."
