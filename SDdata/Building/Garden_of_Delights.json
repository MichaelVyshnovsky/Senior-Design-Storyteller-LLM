        "Location": "The Garden of Delights was located deep within the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]] in Sarahin.",
        "Description": "This large dome was constructed of black stone. The stone was an illusion conjured by [[Ibrihim]], a [[deceiver genie]]. The illusion concealed a beautiful garden enclosed in [[glassteel]].\n\nThe entrance to the garden was located underground, accessible only through a secret passage found in the [[Hall of Audience]].\n\nThough the garden was enhanced by further illusions cast by Ibrihim, it was a paradise to those admitted. Succulent fruit adorned the trees, wondrous animals roamed the garden, and the stream was filled with nectar.\n\nA rose-colored pavilion with pillars embedded with lapis lazuli served as a place for sleeping initiates.",
        "History": "Initiates of the [[Everlasting]] were taken to the garden to get a taste of what awaited them after a life of devout service. Beautiful men and women called ''huriye'' waited on them, fulfilling any desire.",
        "Inhabitants": "Two mute [[jann]] guarded the entrance to the garden, protecting it from everyone except the [[Marwan al-Jabal al-Hiyali|Shadow Caliph]], [[Batina al-Shaat]], and Ibrihim.\n\nWhen abandoned, six [[giant cobra]]s roamed the garden, attacking anyone who might intrude."
