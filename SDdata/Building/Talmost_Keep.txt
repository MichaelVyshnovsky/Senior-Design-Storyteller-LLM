'''Talmost Keep''' was a ruined fortification lying in [[Ardeep Forest]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. It was the former royal seat of [[Talmost|House Talmost]], never reclaimed by its descendants.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|2,3,5,6}}

==Location==
Talmost Keep was located just outside the end of Ardeep Forest's northern spur, in the [[Talmost Lands]].

==History==
The Keep originally lay in the lands of [[Delimbiyran]], and the Talmosts were ennobled in [[659 DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|7}}

In the {{YearlinkName|942}}, [[drow]] raiders struck hard along the [[Sword Coast]], with Talmost pillaged and the people enslaved. The royal family fled and resettled in [[Nimoar's Hold]], though they maintained their ownership of their lands. They became officially ennobled in Waterdeep the same year and became one of the leading families of the city.

By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Keep was a ruin haunted only by the [[ghost]]s of people tortured to death by the drow raiders. Occasionally, swarms of fiendish [[spider]]s were known to emerge from the ruins' depths to menace the area. Sages believed that they could have been arriving from some ''[[portal]]'' that connected the ruined keep with a drow temple in the [[Underdark]].
