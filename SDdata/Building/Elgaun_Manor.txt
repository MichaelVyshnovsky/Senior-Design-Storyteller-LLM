'''Elgaun Manor''' was a grand estate in [[Tegal's Mark]] that served as the summer home to a wealthy [[Sembia]]n family from [[Yhaunn]].

==Structure==
The facade of the manor was heavily windowed and its amenities included an indoor pool. 

==Staff==
While the family from Sembia occupied the house during the summer, it was tended to in winter months by a local Tassadran couple.

==Entertainment==
The family from Sembia often used the manor to host parties for their southern neighbors, hiring [[mage]]s to delight the guests with [[illusion]]s, as well as minstrels and [[bard]]s to entertain with music. Their celebrations could last for days and involved pranks, accidents, and occasionally murder. 

On one occasion, two rival mages flew around Tegal's Hill throwing ''[[fireball]]s'' at one another. This incident garnered the attention of the [[Grand Mairshar]], who asked that she be given a warning before the next soir√©e, for fear of terrifying the townsfolk of the Mark.
