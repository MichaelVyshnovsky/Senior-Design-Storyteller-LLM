The '''S'tung Monastery''', also known as '''S'tung Temple''', was an ancient monastery in the [[Bashan Do Province]] of [[T'u Lung]]. Notably, it was where the powerful placards of the [[Edu'sascar]] were kept.

==Location==
The S'tung Monastery stood in the southern [[Hills of Quai]]. No roads or trails connected it to surrounding settlements, though the city of [[Ha'chou]] in the north was the nearest.

==History==
The monastery was founded by its first abbot, a [[shukenja]] turned [[monk]]. His real name was lost to history, with only his posthumous title [[Sky Father]] recorded, in reference to his keen interest in [[astronomy]].

In {{YearlinkConvert|894|SY}}, this abbot ordered his monks to create five high-quality placards, and they did so, creating the paper and ink from scratch, blessing the materials, and cutting the paper using a holy blade kept in the monastery. Once complete, the abbot carried them into the wilderness on a four-month long retreat. When he returned, he had painted powerful holy symbols upon them, creating the Edu'sascar.

In the centuries after, the monks of S'tung kept the Edu'sascar safe within their walls. Though they were stolen a few times, the thieves always returned them, in order to be rid of their deadly curse.

==Activities==
Each year on the winter equinox,<ref group="note">The source refers to a winter equinox, but this is impossible in the Earth calendar and the [[Calendar of Harptos]]. It may be in error and should refer instead to the [[winter solstice]], [[spring equinox]], or [[autumn equinox]]. Alternatively, the ambiguous [[Kara-Turan calendar]] may include a winter equinox. the monks display the Edu'sascar from the monastery walls as part of a ceremony to honor the [[Celestial Empire|gods of the seasons]]. At such times, they held the placards up and cast their combined magics, causing colorful beams of light to sweep the sky with an appearance similar to an aurora.

The individual cards were used for various important purposes. The most valued was La, with its power to ''[[mass heal]]''. The monks of S'tung carried it when they joined the armies of T'u Lung in battle, using it to heal and rally the troops.
