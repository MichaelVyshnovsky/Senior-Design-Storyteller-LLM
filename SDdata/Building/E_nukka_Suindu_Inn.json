        "History": "Around {{YearlinkConvert|2403|SY}}, the E'nukka Suindu Inn was one of many buildings that were destroyed in Balanzia as the city fell at the hands of the [[Shou Lung]] invasion of T'u Lung.The E'nukka Suindu Inn is not explicitly stated in text to have been destroyed in the incident that destroyed the city. However, on the \"before-and-after\" maps of Balanzia in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' the building is not present on the \"after\" version. Therefore, it can be inferred that it was likely destroyed."
