The Black Stone Inn was a shady drinking establishment located in Daggerford on Water Street and ran by Gildamesh in the late 14 century DR.
The Black Stone Inn was located in Daggerfords River Quarter, right outside the gates that led to the citys docks and marina.
The Black Stone Inn was a sturdy and under maintained two-story building. Its signage that hung over the inns main entrance was made of wood and depicted a foaming beer stein sliding across a table surface, above which the inns name was written in cursive. The sign itself was filthy, and neglected, encrusted with layers of drunk patrons sick. The innkeeper likely used that as a statement and a way of keeping certain type of clientele away.
The interior was far from pristine. The taproom had many dirty spots and dried splatter of dubious origins, drunk passed out patrons, broken furniture after many-a bar fights, and bent tankards.
The Black Stone Inn offered cheap lodgings, cheap alcohol, and one could almost curtly find a shady fence merchant in the taverns dark corner away from prying eyes. The tavern also had an underground gambling den.
The clientele of the inn consisted mostly of the citys criminal underbelly and poorer citizens. Due to close proximity to the docks, many of the drunkards inside were mariners and sailors, and occasionally, pirates.
The Black Stone Inn was once a ballroom of the same name, where Zhentarim agents had once committed a mass murder. That ballroom was bought by Gildamesh and turned it into an inn.
