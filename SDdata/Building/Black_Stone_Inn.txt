The '''Black Stone Inn''' was a shady drinking establishment located in [[Daggerford]] on [[Water Street]] and ran by [[Gildamesh]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Black Stone Inn was located in Daggerford's River Quarter, right outside the gates that led to the city's docks and marina.

==Exterior==
The Black Stone Inn was a sturdy and under maintained two-story building. Its signage that hung over the inn's main entrance was made of wood and depicted a foaming [[beer]] stein sliding across a table surface, above which the inn's name was written in cursive. The sign itself was filthy, and neglected, encrusted with layers of drunk patrons' sick. The innkeeper likely used that as a statement and a way of keeping certain type of clientele away.

==Interior==
The interior was far from pristine. The taproom had many dirty spots and dried splatter of dubious origins, drunk passed out patrons, broken furniture after many-a bar fights, and bent tankards.

==Services==
The Black Stone Inn offered cheap lodgings, cheap alcohol, and one could almost curtly find a shady fence merchant in the tavern's dark corner away from prying eyes. The tavern also had an underground gambling den.

==Clientele==
The clientele of the inn consisted mostly of the city's criminal underbelly and poorer citizens. Due to close proximity to the docks, many of the drunkards inside were mariners and sailors, and occasionally, pirates.

==History==
The Black Stone Inn was once a ballroom of the same name, where [[Zhentarim]] agents had once committed a mass murder. That ballroom was bought by Gildamesh and turned it into an inn.
