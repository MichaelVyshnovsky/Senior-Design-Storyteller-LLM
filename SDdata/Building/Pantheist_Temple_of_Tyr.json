        "mainbody": "The Pantheist Temple of Tyr was a temple of Tyr the Just God on the Rock of Bral, an asteroid in the Tears of Selûne, Notably, it was the only temple to Tyr in Realmspace that did not lie on the planet of Toril, and its priests held a number of non-standard religious views.\nThe temple was located on Temple Street near its intersection with Hammer Street in the Temple District of the Middle City of Bral, on the starboard side of the asteroid. It sat across the street from the Pantheistic College of Celestian and near the  House of the Path and the Way.\nAlthough the clergy and their practices followed the rules of mainstream Tyrran faith on Toril, the priests here saw Tyr as a patron deity of good warriors in addition to his role as a god of justice. Furthermore, they viewed any lawful good god of justice or war as an aspect or avatar of Tyr, who they said went by different names in different places. In this way, the pantheist priests could receive divine spells in many crystal spheres where Tyr was otherwise unknown. Conventional priests of Tyr from Toril and lawful good warriors from any crystal sphere were welcomed at the temple but tended to be troubled by the priests views.\nThe temple stood despite the Rock being a haven for pirates. The Tyrrans felt compelled to fight crime and injustice wherever they found it. Thus, they waged a number of small crusades and wars on crime on the Rock of Bral. Needless to say, the Tyrrans and their god were not popular there.\nThe priests of the Pantheistic Temple of Tyr often worked against the Underbarons of Bral or against corruption in its civic institutions. For this reason, over time, it began to gain support from the lower classes. The priests also sent its members on quests against neogi slavers or human pirates off-world.\nThe Pantheistic Temple of Tyr was well-respected by the Pragmatic Order of Thought and the Company of the Chalice, two other organizations based in Bral.\nThe faith of Tyr on Bral came from Faerûn, but it had evolved into its unique form from mixing with the Norse pantheon of other worlds, where Tyr was known as a god of war."
