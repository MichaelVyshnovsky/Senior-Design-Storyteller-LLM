        "mainbody": "The '''Fist of the Future''' was a fortress in the city of [[Hill's Edge]] that was converted to a temple in the name of [[Cyric]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The exterior of the temple-fortress was adorned with massive black banners bearing the [[holy symbol]] of Cyric, the Dark Sun.",
        "Activities": "High Dark Priestess [[Emana Gortho]] used resources from the [[Zhentarim]] to attract many deranged, unscrupulous, or otherwise down-and-out individuals to join the ranks of Cyric's faithful. She directed them to amass weapons of war for a planned assault against the [[Cry of Joy]], the local temple to [[Lliira]], with the ultimate goal of taking control of the city.",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, the Cyricists' plans to destroy the Lliiran temple had been repeatedly thwarted, presumably by local [[Harper]] agents.",
        "Inhabitants": "Within a short time after its founding, the temple attracted hundreds of individuals to the [[Cyricist]] faith. As congregations went, they were self-serving and wholly undisciplined, but ultimately very dangerous."
