        "Structure": "Fourwinds Shipping was a one-story building in fair condition.",
        "Services": "Approximately 50% of items shipped through Fourwinds became lost between origin and destination, a problem routinely blamed on the overworked and underpaid staff.\n\nFourwinds Shipping's shipping rates were calculated based on weight, distance, item delicacy, any special handling requirements, and whether the cargo was contraband along the route or at its destination, though Fourwinds Shipping did not accept live cargo. Standard rates started at 1 [[currency|copper piece]] per {{SI|1|pound|long=yes}}. Despite their inefficiencies, Fourwinds Shipping continued to operate, catering to clients willing to gamble on the uncertain arrival of their goods.",
        "Inhabitants": "Fourwinds Shipping was owned by [[Takkee]], a [[human]] [[thief]]. Known for his minimal competence in legitimate shipping and even poorer skills in smuggling, Takkee's lack of expertise often resulted in shipments going astray, which he blamed on his staff."
