        "mainbody": "Fourwinds Shipping was a shipping business in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nFourwinds Shipping was a one-story building in fair condition.\nApproximately 50% of items shipped through Fourwinds became lost between origin and destination, a problem routinely blamed on the overworked and underpaid staff.\nFourwinds Shippings shipping rates were calculated based on weight, distance, item delicacy, any special handling requirements, and whether the cargo was contraband along the route or at its destination, though Fourwinds Shipping did not accept live cargo. Standard rates started at 1 copper piece per . Despite their inefficiencies, Fourwinds Shipping continued to operate, catering to clients willing to gamble on the uncertain arrival of their goods.\nFourwinds Shipping was owned by Takkee, a human thief. Known for his minimal competence in legitimate shipping and even poorer skills in smuggling, Takkees lack of expertise often resulted in shipments going astray, which he blamed on his staff."
