The House of Mirth was an inn in Bralizzar, a caravanserai in the Dustwall Mountains in the midâ€“14 century DR.
The House of Mirth lay along the west side of the Bazaar, south of the Boulevard. This inn was advertised only by a red tile set beside the door.
Its main room was long and narrow, several steps up from the rest of the street. It was well-appointed, with large cushions, small tables, and an elegant carpet. The illumination came from niches in the walls.
The establishment was of middling quality, in between that of the Inn of the Golden Palm and the Swayback Camel. The meals were reasonable and the clientele was not dangerous.
The proprietor was Tasha Lal, who employed three women.
