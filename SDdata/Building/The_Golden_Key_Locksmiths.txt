==Location==
This shop was located along the east side of [[Warriors' Way]], north of [[Waterdeep Way]], in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] of Waterdeep.

This shop stood two stories tall.

==Services==
The Golden Key sold all manner of [[lock (item)|lock]]s and fasteners, including custom made to order locks that each had a key guaranteed to be key. Many of the proprietor's unique locks required several keys being turned in a certain combination in order to unlock them.
