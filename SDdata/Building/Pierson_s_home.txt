'''Pierson's home''' was one of the houses in the village of [[West Harbor]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. It belonged to [[Pierson]].

==Location==
Located in near the center of the village, Pierson's home was located next to [[Tarmas' home]].

==Structure==
Like the other houses in West Harbor, Pierson's home was wooden.

==Interior==
The building was small. It was composed of a single room, with barrels, a bed, and a drawer.

==History==
[[Pierson]] lived in this house. When [[duergar]] and [[bladeling]]s attacked the village in [[1374 DR]], Pierson locked himself in the house, afraid someone would steal his supplies. The [[Kalach-Cha]] was able to intimidate him, lie to him, pick the lock, or bash the door to get in. In any case, the Kalach-Cha could've ordered him to get into the fight, since he was a member of the militia. After Pierson went to the field, the Kalach-Cha could've looted his house or leave the supplies.
