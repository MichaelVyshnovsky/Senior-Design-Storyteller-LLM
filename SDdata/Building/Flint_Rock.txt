'''Flint Rock''', also written as '''Flintrock''', was the [[ancestral mound]] of the [[Elk tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s located in the [[Evermoors]] region of the [[Savage Frontier]]. It was used for veneration of the of the Elk beast totem of the god [[Uthgar]].  It was a set of concentric hills, with a central depression that was shaped like the profile of a leaping elk.

==Geography==
[[File:Evermoors-5e-Mike Schley.png|thumb|left|''A map of the Evermoors, showing Flint Rock in the southwestern hills.'']]
Flint Rock was found in the southeastern [[Surbrin Hills]] that lay in the southwestern part of the Evermoors,<ref>

[[Elk]] were known to live in and around the mounds.

==Description==
[[File:Uthgardt ancestral mounds.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''An overhead view of Flint Rock (right), compared to a regular circular mound (left). Note the elk-shaped inner vale.'']]
Whereas most Uthgardt ancestral mounds were of earth, Like many Uthgardt ancestral mounds, it was shaped roughly like its totem beast, with the inner vale resembling a leaping elk stag if seen from above.

The outer ring held a number of cairns, in which were interred the remains of the Elk tribe's most exceptional champions.

The inner ring bore four [[menhir]]s of gray stone, with one in each of the cardinal directions Between them stood twelve totem poles. With these, shamans could track the seasons, the [[calendar]] dates, and the [[star]]s.
 
At the very center of Flint Rock was a massive stone slab that served as the altar. Rectangular in shape and with smooth-worn surfaces, it was {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} by {{SI|6|feet|long=yes}} and {{SI|3|feet|long=yes}} high and weighed several tons.

Buried beneath the central altar was a spearhead taken from a magical [[giant]]-crafted [[spear]]—a massive piece of [[mithral]] weighing {{SI|75|lb|k|long=yes}} and {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in length. It emanated a faint aura of [[divination]] [[magic]] to the likes of a ''[[detect magic]]'' [[spell]], but whatever powers it had had faded by the late 1400s DR. It was considered a relic of the giants of the North.

==Activities==
A sacred burial ground, it was here where the most accomplished chiefs and shamans of the Elk tribe were interred.

Members of the Elk tribe also held their [[Runemeet]] at Flint Rock each year on the autumn equinox. Here, like other Uthgardt tribes, they would venerate the Elk totem of Uthgar, make laws and policies, hold marriages and funerals, and celebrate births and formalize adoptions. Meanwhile, both experienced warriors and youths seeking to be accepted as adults undertook a hunt of a ritual enemy, who for the Elk tribe was "the ancient ones"—in practice, any ruin, tomb, or sign of a lost civilization counted.

However, every autumn, the [[orc]]s of the Evermoors would also gather and make plans to attack the humans during their Runemeet, so they could serve as a ritual enemy too.

In the mid-to-late 1300s [[DR]], when the Elk tribe had turned to other, darker gods, Flint Rock was near-deserted and only a few still came here for Runemeets.

==History==
In ancient times, early followers of Uthgar who would found the Elk tribe interred the magical giant-crafted mithral spearhead under the altar at Flint Rock to empower the ancestral mound.

In the {{YearlinkName|775}}, the [[Uthgardt Alliance]] stood against an army of [[goblin]]s and orcs led by [[ogre]]s that marched out of the Evermoors. Though the Uthgardt defeated the horde, the Elk tribe warriors were nearly annihilated when they defended the Flintrock ancestral mound. The loss of the Uthgardt warriors and the suffering of the tribes led to the dissolution of the Alliance over the following five years. In the aftermath, the Elk tribe was close to dying out. Though they survived, they eventually became not much more than bandits.

By the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the ancestral mound was nearly abandoned, yet it was still used during Runemeets at that time.

By the 1480s DR, Flint Rock seemed in better condition, but it was not uncommon to find no one there.

==Rumors & Legends==
Any hunters or [[adventurer]]s who harmed or slew an elk while in proximity to the ancestral mound risked being cursed. Thereafter, their wounds would not heal naturally and they were treated as hated enemies of the Elk tribe, until [[remove curse|the curse was lifted]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Berchtwald Bandyleg]], [[shaman]] of the Elk totem of Uthgar in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He led the rites at Flint Rock.
