Four towers were placed around the central spire that was elevated  off the gourd. The corner towers connected to the central spire by covered archways.\nMagis Tor served as the base for a group of adventuring mages of Tethyr known as Magis Mir. Before the  and the Ten Black Days of Eleint, members of Magis Mir were opponents of all malevolent undead creatures and the infamous Twisted Rune. Magis Mir went missing seven months after they defeated Runecount Tuvos Akasi during the Ten Black Days. As of the late 14 century DR, the adventuring band had not been seen nor heard from since their disappearance. It was believed that Magis Tor could only be entered by the individuals wearing a special ring. Each member of Magis Mir had one such ring in their possessions."
