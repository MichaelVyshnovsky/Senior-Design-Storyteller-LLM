The Friary of St. Amahl was an Ilmatari monastery in the middle of the Calim Desert.
The friary was 75 miles (120.7 kilometers) south of the city of Memnon, along the Trade Way.
A former caravanserai, the Friary of St. Amahl had heavily shuttered windows to protect against the desert storms. It contained a well that had never gone dry.
This safehouse was named after St. Amahl, the Ilmatari saint of desert nomads. The local legend of the place was that their well would never run dry as long as they continued to be watched over by their patron saint.
