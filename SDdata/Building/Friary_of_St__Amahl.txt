The '''Friary of St. Amahl''' was an [[Ilmatari]] monastery in the middle of the [[Calim Desert]].

{{Quote|&hellip;while St. Amahl watches over us&hellip;|the brothers of the Friary of St. Amahl regarding how long their well would last}}

==Location==
The friary was 75 miles (120.7 kilometers) south of the city of [[Memnon]], along the [[Trade Way]].

==Structure==
A former [[caravanserai]], the Friary of St. Amahl had heavily shuttered windows to protect against the desert storms. It contained a well that had never gone dry.

==Rumors and legends==
This safehouse was named after [[St. Amahl]], the Ilmatari saint of desert nomads. The local legend of the place was that their well would never run dry as long as they continued to be watched over by their patron saint.<ref>
