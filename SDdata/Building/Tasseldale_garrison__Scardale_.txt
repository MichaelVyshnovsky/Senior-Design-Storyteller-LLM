The '''Tasseldale garrison''' was a fortification in [[Scardale Town]] established by [[Tasseldale]] during the coalition occupation of [[Scardale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Early on in the occupation of Scardale, the garrison forces of [[Talonshield]] mercenaries had been bribed by [[Lady Sashesh]] to shift their allegiance to [[Sembia]]. The company's commander, Mairshar [[Hareth Windtamer]], was unaware as to why his soldiers had a change of loyalty.
