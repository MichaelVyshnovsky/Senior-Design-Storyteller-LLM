'''Haldos's Fine Butchery''' was a shop located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]], near the center of the city. It was a butchery and was owned by [[Haldos]].

==History==
The butchery was in business by [[1358 DR]] and still in business in [[1369 DR]].

Famed traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] wrote about the business in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]''.

==Description==
Haldos's Fine Butchery consisted of a shop, stockyards, and slaughterhouse, which all lay in the center of the city to the irritation of its neighbors. The sounds of animals, slaughter, and butchery were an annoyance to all.

==Services==
Haldos was a butcher, selling meat to his customers. He was one of the few who could slaughter a beast on the spot and provide the freshest possible meat, without being smoked and hung. This was valued by particular cooks, as well as [[alchemist]]s, [[priest]]s, and [[wizard]]s, who required fresh meat for other purposes.
