        "Structure": "The building housing this shop stood three stories tall.",
        "Services": "This shop sold all manner of drinkables, particularly exotic [[cordial]]s and [[wine]]s, rebottled from travel [[cask]]s and [[keg]]s into exquisite, high quality [[bottle]]s. These bottles were either acquired by the owners from other sellers, or made on site by [[Suedlaurma Bhephel|Suedlaurma]], who had learned the art of [[glassblowing]] from the [[gnome]]s at [[Tammerbund's Glasswares]].\n\nThese various bottles were consistently strong sellers for the shop. Some of them were even suitable for use as [[decanter]]s and Bhephel's Bottles was more than willing to offer refills of their beverages to anyone that brought one of these decanters back.",
        "Reputation": "In the very status conscious city of Waterdeep, the exquisite bottles of the shop were highly prized, considered by many a laborer or shopkeeper to serve as an affordable \"handsome gift\" at any feast or wedding.",
        "Inhabitants": "This business was owned by the [[elf|elven]] couple Suedlaurma and [[Vlorn Bhephel]], who lived in the business with their son [[Rauvelore Bhephel]]."
