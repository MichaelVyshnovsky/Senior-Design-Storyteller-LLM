        "mainbody": "Bhephels Bottles was an alcohol store in the city of Waterdeep in 1370 DR.\nThis shop was located along Sulmor Street, in the North Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe building housing this shop stood three stories tall.\nThis shop sold all manner of drinkables, particularly exotic cordials and wines, rebottled from travel casks and kegs into exquisite, high quality bottles. These bottles were either acquired by the owners from other sellers, or made on site by Suedlaurma, who had learned the art of glassblowing from the gnomes at Tammerbunds Glasswares.\nThese various bottles were consistently strong sellers for the shop. Some of them were even suitable for use as decanters and Bhephels Bottles was more than willing to offer refills of their beverages to anyone that brought one of these decanters back.\nIn the very status conscious city of Waterdeep, the exquisite bottles of the shop were highly prized, considered by many a laborer or shopkeeper to serve as an affordable \"handsome gift\" at any feast or wedding.\nThis business was owned by the elven couple Suedlaurma and Vlorn Bhephel, who lived in the business with their son Rauvelore Bhephel."
