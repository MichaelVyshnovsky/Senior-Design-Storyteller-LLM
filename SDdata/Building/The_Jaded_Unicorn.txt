'''The Jaded Unicorn''' was a ramshackle former warehouse in [[Scornubel]] was turned into an inn and tavern. It featured a life-sized purple [[unicorn]] statue that was wearing makeup. The rooms were of very poor quality and had a bad smell. It had a bad record for violent crime. It was the only inn in the city that would allow [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s to stay as guests. To keep the injuries to a minimum, the tavern used earthenware tankards. The tap room got very noisy and extremely crowded. There were reports of the city's youths being kidnapped from The Jaded Unicorn to be forced into a sailing career.

==Food and drink==
The food served at The Jaded Unicorn consisted of slabs of bread, wedges of [[cheese]], [[hare]] stew, pan-fried [[trout]] and roast cuts soaked in stale [[beer]]. The food and drink here was cheap compared to the rest of the city.
