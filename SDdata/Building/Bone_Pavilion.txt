The '''Bone Pavilion''' was a macabre structure found in [[Ysawis]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Location==
The pavilion sat nestled within the [[King's Garden]] that sprawled across the entire inner eastern face of the [[Jade Palace of the Necromancers]].

==Description==
The exterior of this nightmarish structure was made of white rock, appearing to be made of blanched bones. The pavilion's towering walls, patio and domed roof were decorated with [[alabaster]] statues depicting ghastly scenes. The interior was illuminated with pale green ''[[continual light]]''. Additionally, statues made from different parts of [[human]] skeletons adorned the patio surrounding the pavilion.

Wide archways covered with flowing silk provided access to the interior of the Bone Pavilion. The walls and domed ceiling here were made from polished white [[jade]]. They were decorated with a scene depicting a city being sacked by an army of [[undead]]. The elegant rugs, couches and pillows decorating the Bone Pavilion were marred by occasional dark spots which were dried blood. A {{SI|10|ft}} square of pitch black rested in the center of the Bone Pavilion. This pit reeked with the stench of putrescence. Foul as it was, this pit was actually a masked stairway leading to a private chamber beneath the pavilion. The darkness was enchanted to extinguish any light source passing with it.

==Inhabitants==
The Bone Pavilion was the domain of the [[necromancer]] [[Sumulael]]. He spent most of his time here after his estrangement from his wife [[Kazerabet]]. [[Netocris bin Shalah]], Sumulael's favorite courtier, and her guards, were usually present within the pavilion. Netocris loved the pavilion and rarely left unless to accompany Sumulael. Both she and her guards were allowed to sleep here when the king retired to his private chamber below the pavilion.

==Defenses==
Sumulael warded the pavilion against ''[[teleportation]]'' and [[divination]], though this was done more so he could enjoy privacy from his wife than to keep intruders out.

[[Improved skull watch|Skull watchers]] carefully monitored all entrances to the pavilion and would instantly alert Sumulael with an ear-piercing scream.

The garden surrounding the Bone Pavilion was patrolled by [[Jungle giant|jungle giant zombies]] and [[ju-ju zombie]]s. Sumulael could also ''[[Animate dead|animate]]'' the skeletal statues found on the patio if the need arose. Sumulael was fond of having the skeletal statues turn their heads to regard visitors.
