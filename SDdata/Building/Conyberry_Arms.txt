Conyberry Arms was a smithy run by ex-adventurer, Martin von Mensch.
The weaponshop was located in Conyberry west of the town of Triboar in the Northwest Faerûn.
Martin von Mensch ran a smithy of sorts. He sold poor quality weapons and it was not uncommon for his goods to be broken at the first swing of a goblins sword. Martin also specialized in cheap blacksmithing, like making shoddy horseshoes, or locks which could only be opened with crowbars. His best made items were actually crowbars.
As of 1367 DR, it was rumored Martin hired a low-level thief with a ring of invisibility to walk around stealing small items off the belts of customers in his shop. People gossiped it might be a great Waterdhavian rogue who was cursed with permanent invisibility and came into the protection of von Mensch.
