'''Conyberry Arms''' was a smithy run by [[adventurer|ex-adventurer]], [[Martin von Mensch]].

==Geography==
The weaponshop was located in [[Conyberry]] west of the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Northwest Faerûn]].

==Services==
Martin von Mensch ran a smithy of sorts. He sold poor quality weapons and it was not uncommon for his goods to be broken at the first swing of a [[goblin]]'s [[sword]]. Martin also specialized in cheap blacksmithing, like making shoddy [[horseshoe]]s, or locks which could only be opened with [[crowbar]]s. His best made items were actually crowbars.

==History==
As of [[1367 DR]], it was rumored Martin hired a low-level thief with a ''[[ring of invisibility]]'' to walk around stealing small items off the belts of customers in his shop. People gossiped it might be a great [[Waterdhavian]] [[rogue]] who was cursed with permanent invisibility and came into the protection of von Mensch.
