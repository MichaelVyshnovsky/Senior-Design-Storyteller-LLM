The '''Inn of the Dragon''' was a [[inn]] found in the [[village]] of [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]] in [[the Vast]].

==History==
After [[human]] [[adventurer]]s slew the [[red dragon]] [[Halarglautha Firewings]], who'd laired at the nearby [[Dragon Falls (waterfall)|Dragon Falls waterfall]], the survivors took possession of the dragon's hoard of coins. They chose to settle there and constructed themselves a stronghold, while the village grew around it over four generations.

By [[1370 DR]], the stronghold had changed owners and was redeveloped as an inn, called the Inn of the Dragon.

==Description==
As a former stronghold, the Inn of the Dragon was a fortified inn, constructed of stone and [[fir]] [[wood]]. It dominated the village around it.

==Inhabitants==
The village priest and one of the original adventurers, [[Keldar of the Forest]], lived at the inn.
