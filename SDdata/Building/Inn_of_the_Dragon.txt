The Inn of the Dragon was a inn found in the village of Dragon Falls in the Vast.
After human adventurers slew the red dragon Halarglautha Firewings, whod laired at the nearby Dragon Falls waterfall, the survivors took possession of the dragons hoard of coins. They chose to settle there and constructed themselves a stronghold, while the village grew around it over four generations.
By 1370 DR, the stronghold had changed owners and was redeveloped as an inn, called the Inn of the Dragon.
As a former stronghold, the Inn of the Dragon was a fortified inn, constructed of stone and fir wood. It dominated the village around it.
The village priest and one of the original adventurers, Keldar of the Forest, lived at the inn.
