Owned by [[Jolym]], it was in operation by [[1366 DR]].<ref group=\"note\">Unlike the other Loudwater locations described in ''[[Volo's Guide to the North]]'', Jolym's Barrels & Packing is not reprinted in ''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]''. It was more likely omitted for reasons of space, rather than being out of business.",
        "Services": "The store sold [[barrel]]s for 3 [[gold piece]]s, [[hand keg]]s for 1 gp, and standard-sized crates for 2 [[silver piece]]s each. Jolym also manufactured packing crates of custom size or purpose; prices ranged from 5 sp (usually for a crate large enough for two people to carry) to 5 gp each."
