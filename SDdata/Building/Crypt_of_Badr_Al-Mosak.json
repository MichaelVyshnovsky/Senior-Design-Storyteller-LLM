        "mainbody": "The '''Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak''' was an ancient tomb in [[Raurin]] that was repurposed as a stronghold by the [[efreet]] [[Khalitharius]] in the {{yearlinkName|1356}}, shortly after his release.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|80}}",
        "Location": "The Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak was about {{SI|50|mile|k|long=yes}} south by southwest of the [[Oasis of the White Palm]], across a formation of blasted hills. It was most accessible from the north.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|145}}",
        "Structure": "The Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak lay in the middle of some low-lying rocky hills. Above ground, it had a few broken pillars surrounding a terraced bowl. Those who looked upon these pillars reported a feeling of menace.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|33}}\n\nA midnight-blue stone statue with a pharaoh's headdress stood in the middle of the stone bowl. It was only {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} tall, on a {{SI|3|feet|long=yes}} scalloped base, which was free of sand. The statue had robes gathered in one hand, and a scepter in the other. The base had a scalloped edge, which contrasted with the dead-white stone platform beneath. This platform had three broad steps. The bowl formed an amphitheater with ten rows of seats.\n\nBeneath the statue, there was a vertical shaft leading {{SI|90|feet|long=yes}} down towards a lower level. A trap {{SI|10|feet}} down the shaft would slice along the shaft if it detected any object larger than {{SI|3|cu ft|long=yes}} going through it.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|81}}\n\nThe first chamber in the lower level had four chambers each {{SIAdj|10|feet|long=yes|adj=wide}} and {{SIAdj|20|feet|long=yes|adj=long}} and aligned with the cardinal points. These each held a statue, and all would be animated when triggered by a weight of at least {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}}. The western statue was of a fish-headed woman holding six blades that dripped with something, and would rush down the corridor attacking all along the way if triggered. The northern statue was of an efreet, and triggering it would send a fireball into the chamber. The eastern statue was of a being with four arms, each holding a [[bow]]: it shot out [[silver]] [[arrow]]s, which would teleport back to the statue after hitting. It was possible to recover those arrows from the statue itself, however.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|135}}\n\nThe southern statue was covered in blades that pointed back towards the hallway; it was actually a secret door leading further into the crypt. Immediately behind it was a room terminated by another statue, this one of a man holding a [[flail]] and a crook with his arms folded across his chest. The statue was a secret door. The west door led towards a room with a enchanted dagger, a ''[[scroll of protection from elementals]]'', two ''[[potion of invisibility|potions of invisibility]]'' and a scroll of three wizard spells. During the rescue of [[Princess Shadalah]], the room also had five [[wight]]s waiting for a chance to re-enter the tomb proper after a sortie outside. The east door was seemingly empty, but held a secret door. This secret door led to the west-most oracle.\n\nThe [[Malatath]], Khalitharius' army of restless spirits, bided their time in the Catacomb of Kings, behind the hidden door; it opened into a {{SI|10|foot|long=yes}} wide bridge {{SI|110|foot|long=yes}} long. There was a {{SI|60|foot|long=yes}} drop around the bridge, leading to the floor where the [[undead]] rested; the place was covered in unyielding darkness. The bridge itself was covered in strands of [[moss]] and [[mold]]. The walls were {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} away; the chill of death, and soft moaning cries, hung in the air.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|82}}\n\nBeyond the bridge lay an altar room. At the center, a shaft of light shone down on an altar; five different inscriptions on the walls would solicit a sacrifice in the name of [[Seker]]. If a [[magical item]] was held within {{SI|3|feet|long=yes}} of the altar, a voice would call out \"Seker Asks\". Placing a magical item on the altar would then yield ''[[Seker's Harness]]''. The altar room held three hallways leading east, west, and south; all of them were oracle rooms. A magical effect placed on a {{SIAdj|8|feet|long=yes|adj=tall}} obelisk on each oracle room would answer all questions randomly, but with a sagely voice. Only the western oracle had no northern exit; the other oracles had doors in all directions, though the doors to the room southeast and southwest of the altar were secret. The southeast and southwestern rooms held {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes}} hollow cubes of stone; the eastern one held four [[necrophidius|necrophidi]] protecting a ''[[libram of gainful conjuration]]''. Interestingly, going west from the western oracle, south from the southern, or east from the eastern led to pits of infinite falling, where anything would fall through the bottom only to be teleported back to the top.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|82}}\n\nThe pits of everfall were the only way to access the hidden upper level of the crypt. The western pit held, besides small rocks, only a skeleton in plate mail; the southern pit held debris and several pieces of treasure, including a ''[[crystal ball]]'' with ''[[clairaudience]]'', a ''[[helm of opposite alignment|helm of alignment change]]'', a scroll of ''[[fireball]]'', and two vials of ''[[oil of slipperiness]]''. The eastern everfall only held a few creatures of note, namely three mummies. The pits extended {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} below the entrance to the level and {{SI|140|feet|long=yes}} upwards; the entrance to the upper level was {{SI|50|feet}} up.\n\nThe upper levels of the crypt were only accessible by climbing up through the pits of everfall. All of them opened onto octagonal rooms where beams of light bounced off the walls; four specific rays were dangerous, dealing cold, electricity, the effects of a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell, and a ''[[teleport]]'' that would send anyone to the southern everfall pit. The beams were susceptible to ''[[dispel magic]]''.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|83}}\n\nIf the amulet of the Sheik was held at that time, the efreet would've been struck by a blue beam which caused him intense pain and shock; he would only have been able to continue fighting for a couple of minutes before he decided to flee, leaving behind Princess Shadalah's bottle.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|84}} On taking the gem, if its {{SIAdj|1|lb|long=yes}} weight wasn't replaced as it was removed, new rays would shine on all real flagstones; those rays could petrify anyone they touched.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|85}}\n\nThe last room in the crypt, accessible through an arch across the room of the Star Gem, was empty except for scorched, blasted, pitted walls, scraps of cloth, rusted weapons, and other junk.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|85}}",
        "Defenses": "The statue itself was the focus of a permanent ''[[fear]]'' effect, whose strength was greater than normal; it had been placed by the efreet, and would break if the statue was moved.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|80}}\n\nAmongst the monsters wandering the crypt were mummies, wights, wraiths, a spectre, [[giant rat]]s, a [[gorgon]], [[giant snake|giant cobras]], and [[giant spider]]s.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|80}}",
        "History": "Badr Al-Mosak was said to have stolen the gem of Shah-Pelar, which had later been buried with him.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}}\n\nAfter Khalitharius's release, his minions used the Crypt as a base of operations. Whatever tracks they left after a battle in the desert led in the direction of the tomb, though they disappeared after a mile or so.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|32}}\n\nAs of {{yearlink|1492}}, the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak had remained in [[Raurin]] through the [[Spellplague]]. There was a sarcophagus rather than a statue on top of the shaft, however.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "[[Barus Broadblade]], after being interrogated by the dervish cultists in the oasis, had come to believe (correctly) that the efreet had taken the princess to his stronghold in the Crypt.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|76}} [[Tolnus Granicus]], guildmaster of the [[Sandvoyagers' Guild]], had independently come to a similar conclusion.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|79}}",
