House of Pride was a perfume shop in the city of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.
This store was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward,
This building stood one-story tall. A special enchantment placed over the store prevented its glass goods from shattering or falling apart by any means, though they could still be vaporized or melted.
The House of Pride was well stocked, selling a wide variety of perfumes and exotic scents sourced from all across Faer√ªn, including the burnt ashes of a snowsnake and the musk of female giant slugs. All contained within glass bottles of various sizes, shapes, and hues.
The store was guarded by a group of trained, fiercely-loyal hunting dogs that all sported compact builds.
The House of Pride was among some of the more notable and recognizable shops in the Dock Ward.
