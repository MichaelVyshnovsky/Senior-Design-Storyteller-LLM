The Harvest Hall was a temple of Chauntea in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr.
The Harvest Hall was the largest temple in Wheloon, but a modest one.
The Harvest Hall had a long history in Wheloon, dating back nearly as far as the Wyvern Ferry. It served generations of Whelunians.
By 1358 DR, it was headed by Harandave Donohar, a famed priest of Chauntea. He still held the position in 1369 DR.
Following Harandaves death, his daughter Katriana Donohar took over as head of the temple. She held the position by 1374.
The temple was led by Harandave Donohar until his death, after which he was succeeded by his daughter, Katriana Donohar. They had thirteen followers or attendants, all minor priests.
In addition to regular services, all were welcomed into the Harvest Hall, and it served as a popular local meeting place. During harvest festivals, the temple gave agricultural produce to the poor of Wheloon.
Katriana Donohar was usually at the temple, managing affairs there. She had a large number of divine scrolls, dating back to Harandaves day, which she sold to those she believed would use them for good deeds. The minor priests often journeyed out into the countryside to assist farmers.
