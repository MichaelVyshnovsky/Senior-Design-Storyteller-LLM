Stoutbold Marina was the harbor that belonged to merchant Maerim Stoutbold, later by his ill-reputed son Maerun Stoutbold,
Stoutbold Marina stood to the west from the Harbor Tower of Suzail and to the east from the publicly open Bollivers Wharf.
The Stoutbold enterprise operated in the cities of Suzail and Marsember, dealing in boats and ships. The shops harbor held ships available for purchase, rent, and repair. Stoutbold Marina also offered outfitting services (nets, ropes, masts, and sails) and was eager to purchase marine vessels.
