'''Stoutbold Marina''' was the harbor that belonged to merchant [[Maerim Stoutbold]], later by his ill-reputed son [[Maerun Stoutbold]],

==Location==
Stoutbold Marina stood to the west from the [[Harbor Tower (Suzail)|Harbor Tower]] of Suzail and to the east from the publicly open [[Bolliver's Wharf]].

==Services==
The Stoutbold enterprise operated in the cities of Suzail and [[Marsember]], dealing in boats and ships. The shop's harbor held ships available for purchase, rent, and repair. Stoutbold Marina also offered outfitting services ([[net]]s, [[rope]]s, [[mast]]s, and [[sail]]s) and was eager to purchase marine vessels.
