The University of Definitive Archwizardry was a prestigious magic school in Eileanar that taught all magical fields with excellence.
Unlike other institutions, the University did not specialize in a single field of mythal but instead taught all three. It became regarded as the best school of magic in Netheril, as well as the most expensive. The archwizard Baden served as the Dean of Teachers, and taught variator magic alongside Aleman. Cheberk and Tudor taught inventive spells, while Oudinot and Daa handled mentalist students.
