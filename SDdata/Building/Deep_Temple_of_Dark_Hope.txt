The Deep Temple of Dark Hope was a temple dedicated to Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.
The temple was constructed far beneath the streets of Waterdeep.
The temple was used as a stronghold or sanctuary by adventurers exploring Undermountain and the Underdark if they paid the steep fee charged by Ibranduls clergy. The temple was connected to the Dark Gateway via a gate.
