Within his lab, he produced and sold a variety of alchemical reagents and completed mixtures. Among these were [[smokepowder]], [[tanglefoot bag]]s, [[sunrod]]s, and various [[acid]]s and anti-toxins.\n\nOn one occasion, Almaestaddamir made an offer to [[High Councilor (Mistledale)|High Councilor]] [[Haresk Malorn]] to build a machine capable of flinging kegs of smokepowder at [[drow]] raiders in order to better defend the dale. The latter politely declined the proposal."
