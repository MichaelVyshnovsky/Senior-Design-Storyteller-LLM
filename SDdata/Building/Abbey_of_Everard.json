        "mainbody": "The '''Abbey of Everard''' was an abbey dedicated to the god of knowledge, [[Oghma]].",
        "Location": "Following the [[Dusk Road]] north of [[Iriaebor]] about half-a-day's ride, there was a standing stone, marking a road branching off the Dusk Road. Following the road up a low, rounded hill led to the abbey.",
        "Description": "It was a large edifice of gray stone, its ornately embellished spires rising above a walled courtyard. The entrance was a large stout oaken gate. A [[rope]] dangled near the gate that was tied to a bell.\n\nThe entrance hall, past the courtyard, was a high, narrowed room, paneled with mahogany. Faded frescoes decorated the ceiling, as well as intricate stained-glass windows. The building had a cellar and the library was filled with books.\n\n[[Tyveris]]'s spare chamber was small, furnished only with a low bed, a chest, and a table with two chairs. The floor was of stone and it had a simple woven mat on it.",
        "Inhabitants": "The monks of the abbey wore simple brown robes. The head monk of the Abby was Abbess [[Melisende]]. One of the monks was Loremaster [[Ebrelias]], an old man, and another was Loremaster [[Avros]].\n\nThey took in any orphans and raised them as their own.",
        "History": "In [[1363 DR]], [[Caledan Caldorien]] went to the abbey to find his old friend and member of the [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]], [[Tyveris]], so that he could help him free his friend [[Ferret Talondim]] from an execution in [[Iriaebor]]."
