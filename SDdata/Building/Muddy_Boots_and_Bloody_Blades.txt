Muddy Boots and Bloody Blades, also known as Muddy Blades and Bloody Boots, was a tavern in Vaasa, located inside the Vaasan Gate, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The sign outside the tavern, bearing its name, was crossed out and made to say "Muddy Blades and Bloody Boots". This reflected the frustrations of the bounty hunters whose work had been cut out and found not many monsters left to slay.
Muddy Boots and Bloody Blades was frequented by bounty hunters, who would trade ears of creatures such as goblins and orcs for gold.
The tavern sold wine and ale.
