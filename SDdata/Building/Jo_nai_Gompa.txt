Jonai Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot.
It was found in the south of Tabot.
Pang of Pokarr Gompa dismissed Jonai, Mafensea, and LoSsem Gompas as "all alike", with "primitive and gaudy" ceremonies.
It was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Jonai.
Circa , Jonai was among those southern monasteries opposing the northern monasteries in the yig-tsang (monk council) of Tabot.
