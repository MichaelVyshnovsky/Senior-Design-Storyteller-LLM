Where the Maiden Dances was a lovely inn found in the village of Uluvin.
The inn offered cozy, thoughtfully-decorated rooms that were kept very tidy. The staff was well-mannered and quite attentive.
The Maiden Dances was so named for the spectral elf woman who periodically appeared within the inn. While it was a beautiful sight it only appeared to those that were considerably inebriated.
The inn was actually constructed over the location where the elf-maiden was buried.
