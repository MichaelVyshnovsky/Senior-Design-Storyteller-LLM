The Immerhand Inn was an inn located in the city of Wheloon in Cormyr. Its proprietor was Chalthos Immer.
The Immerhand Inn was in business by 1358 DR. It was still in business circa 1369 DR.
Famed traveler Volothamp Geddarm wrote about the business in Volos Guide to Cormyr.
The inn was situated on a waymoot on Wheloons northwestern fringe, a short distance north of Rathools Pond.
It was a dark and rustic-looking building, with stables, a muddy wagonyard, and an outhouse.
Inside the inn, the furniture was a random and mismatched selection of bought, scavenged, and roughly home-made pieces. Each room had beds, stools, and chests, and was lit by a huge storm lantern such as Chalthos had relied on as a mercenary. Another memento of his career were the paintings hed looted from around Faerûn one in each room provided the sole decoration.
The Immerhand Inn was Wheloons third best inn—out of three. It was a poor quality place that provided no food or drink, do-it-yourself stabling and feeding of mounts, and patrons had to pump their own water for washing.
It wasnt well known, and typically used by drovers and caravan merchants who wanted to stay out of the crowded town centre.
