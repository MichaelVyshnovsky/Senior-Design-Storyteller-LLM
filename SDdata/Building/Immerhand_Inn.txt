The '''Immerhand Inn''' was an [[inn]] located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]]. Its proprietor was [[Chalthos Immer]].

==History==
The Immerhand Inn was in business by [[1358 DR]]. It was still in business ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

Famed traveler [[Volothamp Geddarm]] wrote about the business in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]''.

==Location==
The inn was situated on a waymoot on Wheloon's northwestern fringe, a short distance north of [[Rathool's Pond]].

==Description==
It was a dark and rustic-looking building, with stables, a muddy wagonyard, and an outhouse.

Inside the inn, the furniture was a random and mismatched selection of bought, scavenged, and roughly home-made pieces. Each room had beds, stools, and chests, and was lit by a huge [[lantern|storm lantern]] such as Chalthos had relied on as a mercenary. Another memento of his career were the paintings he'd looted from around [[Faerûn]]; one in each room provided the sole decoration.

==Services==
The Immerhand Inn was Wheloon's third best inn—out of three. It was a poor quality place that provided no food or drink, do-it-yourself stabling and feeding of mounts, and patrons had to pump their own water for washing.

It wasn't well known, and typically used by [[drover]]s and [[caravan]] merchants who wanted to stay out of the crowded town centre.
