'''Kurth Tower''' was a fortified castle that served as the headquarters of the [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captain]] of [[Ship Kurth]] in [[Luskan]].

==Location==
The tower dominated [[Closeguard Island]] in the mouth of the [[River Mirar]].

==Structure==
It was a large building with a grand fa√ßade. The structure comprised a squat, thick-walled keep and a tall command tower that afforded a view of incoming [[ship]]s.

==Interior==
The fortress was one of the most secure locations in Luskan, Visitors were entertained in a room with an eastward-facing balcony that boasted an impressive view of Luskan and its docks.

==Defenses==
Anyone who had no affiliation with either Ship Kurth or the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] was not even allowed on Closeguard Island, much less near Kurth Tower. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tower was patrolled by two shifts of twenty guards each, all of whom were equipped with [[chainmail]] and armed with [[spear]]s, [[broadsword]]s, [[hand crossbow]]s, and [[dagger]]s. In addition, the tower had [[magic]]al defenses installed during that time by [[Archmage Arcane]] [[Arklem Greeth]], including protections against most forms of magical intrusion (although it did not stop the powers of [[psionicist]]s).

The door to the High Captain's bedchamber was locked and trapped. It required three separate keys to open safely.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a group of pirates attempted to deliver the ''[[Sword of Icewind Dale]]'' to High Captain Kurth, but they were intercepted at Kurth Tower by the [[Heroes of Ascore]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, Kurth Tower was assailed by a horde of [[gnoll]]s as part of [[House Margaster]]'s invasion of Luskan.

==Notable Inhabitants==
* High Captain [[Kurth]], the namesake of Ship Kurth and its leader during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. He was said to possess a ''[[teleport ring]]'' that could instantly transport him to Kurth Tower.
* Subsequent leaders of Ship Kurth, who by tradition, also took the name "Kurth".
* [[Beniago Kurth]], the First High Captain of Luskan as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
