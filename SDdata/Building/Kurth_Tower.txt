Kurth Tower was a fortified castle that served as the headquarters of the High Captain of Ship Kurth in Luskan.
The tower dominated Closeguard Island in the mouth of the River Mirar.
It was a large building with a grand fa√ßade. The structure comprised a squat, thick-walled keep and a tall command tower that afforded a view of incoming ships.
The fortress was one of the most secure locations in Luskan, Visitors were entertained in a room with an eastward-facing balcony that boasted an impressive view of Luskan and its docks.
Anyone who had no affiliation with either Ship Kurth or the Arcane Brotherhood was not even allowed on Closeguard Island, much less near Kurth Tower. As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the tower was patrolled by two shifts of twenty guards each, all of whom were equipped with chainmail and armed with spears, broadswords, hand crossbows, and daggers. In addition, the tower had magical defenses installed during that time by Archmage Arcane Arklem Greeth, including protections against most forms of magical intrusion (although it did not stop the powers of psionicists).
The door to the High Captains bedchamber was locked and trapped. It required three separate keys to open safely.
