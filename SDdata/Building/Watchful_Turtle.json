        "Location": "The warehouses stood beside the bridge over the [[Delimbiyr]]. The carvings of [[dragon turtle]] heads on the bridge, watching over the warehouses, gave the business its name.",
        "Services": "The Watchful Turtled rented out secure storage space, protected by guards but unheated. The cost was 1 [[silver piece]] per crate per month.
