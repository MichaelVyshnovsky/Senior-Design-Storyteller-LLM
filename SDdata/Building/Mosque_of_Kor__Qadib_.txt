The Mosque of Kor was a temple dedicated to Kor in the city of Qadib. It was considered to be among the major temples of Kor in Zakhara.
In 1367 DR, a death threat towards Hakim ibn Rashad, a professor of the College of Religion and Science in Qadib, was discovered pinned by a dagger to the body of his daughters parakeet. Identifying a symbol on the paper as the symbol of Kor, a group of adventurers went to the citys mosque and confronted its imam. The man assured the adventurers that his priesthood had no issue with Hakim, but a hakima among them detected deceit and pressed the imam for more information. The man relented and revealed that it may have been the work of overzealous Kor worshipers, the Wrath of the Old, but knew nothing more than that they were rumored to be headquartered somewhere in the Furrowed Mountains.
