Northfurrows End was an inn located in the walled, Chauntean farming community of Goldenfields. As of the 15 century DR, it was run by the Emerald Enclave sympathizer, Miros Xelbrin.
Northfurrows End was located near the center of Goldenfields, at a spot that overlooked its vast vegetable gardens.
The inn was constructed from stone and stood three stories tall.
On either side of its front doors were two life-size statues of horses standing on their hind legs.
Northfurrows End provided travelers with roomy accommodations and delicious dishes made from fresh, locally grown ingredients.
The inn offered its patrons a locally brewed beer known as Goldengulp. They were served in painted clay flagons that were crafted by the inns proprietor.
