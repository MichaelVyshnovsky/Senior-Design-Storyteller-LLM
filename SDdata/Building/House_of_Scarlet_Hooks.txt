The '''House of Scarlet Hooks''' was a temple of [[Loviatar]], the Maiden of Pain, in the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
By [[1358 DR]] and through to [[1370 DR]] and later, the temple was managed by [[Whipmistress]] [[Shaleen Oomreen|Shaleen "Talonkiss" Oomreen]]. She led twenty-four priests and priestesses, as well as 114 lay worshipers. Among the priests were two [[Pain]]s. All were particularly eager to spread the so-called "holy pain".

==Description==
The House of Scarlet Hooks was one of two temples that dominated daily Calauntan life. It was an impressive building. The double-spired House of Scarlet Hooks was one of the few notable landmarks in the city, as were the muffled screams.
