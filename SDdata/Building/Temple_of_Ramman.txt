==History==
During the tyrannical reign of the god-king [[Gilgeam]], this and other temples of Ishtar were mandated to turn over half of their funds to him.<ref> The [[priest]]hood of the temple was ambivalent towards the growing rebellion against Gilgeam's reign, feeling certain that Gilgeam's forces would inevitably crush the rebels.
