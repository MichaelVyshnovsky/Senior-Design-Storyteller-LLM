'''Rassalantar's Keep''' was a set of ruins that once served as a fortress for the [[warrior]] [[Rassalantar (warrior)|Rassalantar]].

==Geography==
The keep was not far from the [[Sleeping Dragon]], which was east of the hamlet of [[Rassalantar]]. The [[Long Road]] traveled north of [[Waterdeep]] and passed the [[Keep Woods]], which masked the location of the ruins. 

==Interior==
Within the dungeon was a permanent [[teleportation circle]] that was used by Rassalantar to communicate with the [[Blackstaff]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, it was ruined and occupied only by tramps, [[doppelganger]]s, and other monsters.

Around this time, the caravan stop village of Rassalanter, sprung up east of the ruined keep.

Over the next century, most of the keep's stones were dissembled and used for construction in nearby settlements. All that was left was the underground cellar and dungeons, both of which had flooded.
