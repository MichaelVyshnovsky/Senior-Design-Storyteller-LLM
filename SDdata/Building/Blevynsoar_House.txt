'''Blevynsoar House''' was a shop in [[Athkatla]]'s rich [[Athkatla/Gem District|Gem District]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Blevynsoar House stood in the chaotically clustered eastern part of the Gem District. Its northernmost neighbor was [[Fallenstar Fine Gems]] shop across the street, and [[Redcloak Trading]] on [[Sarbront's Walk]], several doors east.

==Activities==
The shop dealt in expensive jewelry and maps. Jewelry on offer was unimpressive by the Gem District's bloated standards, but the shop's main stock was maps dealt from its back room. The owner did not allow browsing, knowing that a map's true price depended on the number of eyes and copies. The establishment also purchased maps, yet due to the proprietor's impressive memory, it was almost impossible to sell him fakes. On occasion, Blevynsoar House commissioned adventures to go on mapping expeditions on the proprietor's behalf.

==History==
The shop's proprietor, [[Jared Blevyn]], the "Mapmaster of Amn," was known as a loyal employee of the gem-trading [[Zhanye]] family of Athkatla. While under its employ, Jared traveled countless roads and, thanks to his uncanny memory, mapped every single detail along his travels. One day, sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Jared used his mapmaking to discover a treasure of [[Parlek's Folly]]. He used the loot to open the Blevynsoar House.
