[[File:Soldiers Monument interior NVW MMO.webp|thumb|300px|''Interior of the Soldier's Monument.'']]
The tomb contained tablets with lore on [[god]]s of [[War domain|war]], namely [[Tempus]] and the [[Red Knight]], as well as a brief history of the tensions between Neverwinter and [[Luskan]].

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tomb had been overrun with [[undead]]. In {{Yearlink|1479}}, a group of [[doomguide]]s belonging to the [[Eternal Order of Kelemvor]] came under attack by [[Thay]]an [[necromancer]]s. One of the doomguides&mdash;[[Ganilon]]&mdash;was taken to the Soldier's Monument to await being sacrificed in a dark ritual.
