The '''Dazzling Dolphin''' was an expensive inn and tavern in the port city of [[Sapra]] on the island of [[Ilighôn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
Like the rest of the city, Dazzling Dolphin was immaculately clean. The establishment offered food, drink, and lodging, which cost ten times the average rate. The inn hosted traveling [[bard]]s allowing performances for tips.

==History==
At some point before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Adamar Session]], [[bard]] of [[Starmantle]], visited the Dazzling Dolphin during his twelve-year adventuring trek across the [[Vilhon Reach]]. The bar noted that despite the hefty price, guests of the Dolphin tipped just as illiberally as they did in Starmantle.
