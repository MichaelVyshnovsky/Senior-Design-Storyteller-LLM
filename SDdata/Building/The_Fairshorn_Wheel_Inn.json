        "mainbody": "he Fairshorn Wheel Inn was an old inn located within the fortified city of Yeshpek on the Lake of Steam in the late 14 century DR.\nThe inn fell into a state of neglect, with entire sections being closed off from the public while the rest of the inn experienced only minimal cleaning and maintenance. The provided suites featured an abundance of space, including alcoves, walk-in closets, and side chambers.\nThe Fairshorn Wheel Inn had a reputation for taking better care of horses than guests, but the inn could be a perfect place for those wishing to be left alone."
