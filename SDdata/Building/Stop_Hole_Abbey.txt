'''Stop Hole Abbey''' was a curio store filled to the brim with artifacts, collectibles, and rarities in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Location==
Stop Hole Abbey was located in the market square of [[Daggerford]], in front of the stables at the city's southern wall.

==Structure==
Stop Hole Abbey's building was exactly thatâ€“an old abandoned abbey that was restored to house [[Vladmyr]]'s collection of curiosities.

==Interior==
The interior of the store was one large open space filled with oddities, artifacts, and bizarre contraptions with the proprietor's desk in the middle of the hall. The dark mysterious room was reminiscent of a museum. Some of the items of note were:
*''[[Crystal ball]]'' - the arcane ''[[scrying]]'' device that once belonged to a [[wizard]] [[Fylanthalas]]. The orb was inactive due a crack after the wizard dropped it fleeing from a tavern to avoid the check.
*''Globe'' - was a model of a celestial body of an alien world that was retrieved from an unknown subterranean temple of some evil power.
*''[[The Music Box]]'' - a huge hanging cage big enough for a [[humanoid]]. The cage's bars were tuning forks that when activated created terrible acoustic torture of reverberating high-pitched sounds. Once the bars were hit, the sound continued until the creature locked inside started bleeding from the ears, and, eventually, driving them insane.
*''Sarcophagus'' - a sinister-looking sarcophagus that was said to have been a slumber place of the most powerful [[vampire]] of the realms (for one day only). The insides of the box were padded and lined with [[silk]] and had a safety locking mechanism on the inside that was not disclosed to the vampire. Once the undead closed the sarcophagus after the first day inside, the lid became securely locked in place. It was said that the vampire is still roaming around searching for this box, or maybe, for the merchant that sold the sarcophagus.
*''ScienceTube'' - a large transparent vat of magical fluid, supposedly, used to create life. The tube could synthesize one of the five pre-determined life forms if the correct incantations were recited in front of this magical device.

==History==
At some point before 1372 DR, Vladmyr came across a long-abandoned abbey building that once housed members of the [[Old Order]]. Vladmyr restored the old gothic building to serve as his store.

During the temporary reign of the corrupt baron [[Matagar Bugo]], following the Duke's disappearance, none of the items in the store were for sale, with some more interesting items reserved for undisclosed clients.
