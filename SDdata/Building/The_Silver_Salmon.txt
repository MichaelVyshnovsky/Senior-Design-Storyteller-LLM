The Silver Salmon was an inn located in the coastal town of Kingsbay on the island of Gwynneth in the Moonshae Isles during the midâ€“14 century DR. The inn was named for the massive run of salmon that traversed the Strait of Alaron each year.
One of the barmaids was a lovely Ffolk lass named Winifred.
