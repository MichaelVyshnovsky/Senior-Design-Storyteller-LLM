The '''Silver Salmon''' was an [[inn]] located in the coastal town of [[Kingsbay (town)|Kingsbay]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The inn was named for the massive run of [[salmon]] that traversed the [[Strait of Alaron]] each year.

One of the barmaids was a lovely [[Ffolk]] lass named Winifred.
