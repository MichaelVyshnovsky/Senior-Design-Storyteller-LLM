Selgards Smithy was a metalworking smithy in Shadowdale, originally owned and operated by Bronn Selgard.
Selgards Smithy lay in central Shadowdale along the North Ride between Tethgars House and the Stone House.
After Bronns death to the Army of Darkhope in Nightal, 1374 DR, Bronns remaining children were hardpressed to keep up with the demands for weapons and armor by the Zhentarim who were occupying the village of Shadowdale.
