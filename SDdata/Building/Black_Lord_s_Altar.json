        "mainbody": "The '''Black Lord's Altar''' was one of the largest temples to [[Bane]] in the Realms,<ref group=\"note\">While the adventure module ''[[Mulmaster Undone]]'' states this temple in [[Mulmaster]] is the largest, ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' states that the temple in [[Mourktar]] holds that distinction. one that was considered for many years to be the center of the [[church of Bane|Black Lord's worshipers]] in the Realms. It was considered the seat of power for the [[High Imperceptor of Bane|High Imperceptors]] of Bane, leader of the orthodox branch of the Banite Faith.\n\nFor a period during the midâ€“14{{th}} century, the temple was re-dedicated to the worship of [[Cyric]], but was restored some decades later.",
        "Description": "Deep beneath the temple was a hidden vault that held an [[artifact]] sacred to the Banite faith: a single scale of a [[topaz dragon]], upon which had been inscribed a message in [[Iokharic]] by the mortal Bane himself. The text described the events surrounding the destruction of [[Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud]], a [[primordial]] that dare infringed upon the Dark Lord's domain.",
        "Geography": "The temple was located along the northern slopes of Mulmaster, near the city's [[Tower of the Blades]].",
        "History": "Following the death of Bane during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, High Imperceptor [[Szchulan Darkoon]] converted to the faith of Cyric, taking on the title of Strifelord, and transforming the Black Lord's Altar in the process. Darkoon began hiding within his Mulman temple like a coward, and no High Imperceptor was recognized by the Banite church following his blasphemy.\n\nSome time in or around the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] ventured through the [[Mulmaster/Sewers|sewers]] beneath Mulmaster and attempted to use [[stonecutter acid]] to weaken the temple's foundation,{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|44}} and demolish the structure with the detonation of a ''[[devastation orb]]'' in the city.{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|46}} They sought to humiliate the Banites of the city and demonstrate the faith was weaker than it appeared.{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|5}}"
