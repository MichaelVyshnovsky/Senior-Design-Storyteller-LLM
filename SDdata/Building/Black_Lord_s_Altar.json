It was considered the seat of power for the High Imperceptors of Bane, leader of the orthodox branch of the Banite Faith.\nFor a period during the midâ€“14 century, the temple was re-dedicated to the worship of Cyric, but was restored some decades later.\nDeep beneath the temple was a hidden vault that held an artifact sacred to the Banite faith a single scale of a topaz dragon, upon which had been inscribed a message in Iokharic by the mortal Bane himself. The text described the events surrounding the destruction of Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud, a primordial that dare infringed upon the Dark Lords domain.\nThe temple was located along the northern slopes of Mulmaster, near the citys Tower of the Blades.\nFollowing the death of Bane during the Time of Troubles in the , High Imperceptor Szchulan Darkoon converted to the faith of Cyric, taking on the title of Strifelord, and transforming the Black Lords Altar in the process. Darkoon began hiding within his Mulman temple like a coward, and no High Imperceptor was recognized by the Banite church following his blasphemy.\nSome time in or around the , the Cult of the Black Earth ventured through the sewers beneath Mulmaster and attempted to use stonecutter acid to weaken the temples foundation, and demolish the structure with the detonation of a devastation orb in the city. They sought to humiliate the Banites of the city and demonstrate the faith was weaker than it appeared."
