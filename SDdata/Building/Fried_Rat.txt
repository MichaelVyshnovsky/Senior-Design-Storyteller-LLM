The Fried Rat was a restaurant on Rat Alley in Luskan established by two retired shiphands who had developed a taste for rat after long periods at sea, and wanted to serve it.
The restaurant burned down long before 1370 DR. Two theories existed one was that flaming grease was responsible for the fire, and the other was that discontented wererats were to blame.
