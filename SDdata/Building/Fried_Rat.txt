The '''Fried Rat''' was a restaurant on [[Rat Alley]] in [[Luskan]] established by two retired shiphands who had developed a taste for [[rat]] after long periods at sea, and wanted to serve it.

==History==
The restaurant burned down long before [[1370 DR]]. Two theories existed: one was that flaming grease was responsible for the fire, and the other was that discontented [[wererat]]s were to blame.
