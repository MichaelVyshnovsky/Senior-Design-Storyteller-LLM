        "mainbody": "he Bright Ladys Tower was a powerful and influential temple of Sel没ne in Selgaunt in the 8 century DR.\nIn the Year of Lost Wayfarers, 757 DR, High Moonmistress Brima Chintamn declared charges of heresy against the New Moon Pact, claiming they had fallen to the belief that Shar and Sel没ne were two facets of the same being. After gaining support from ten other major foreign temples of Sel没ne, the Pact was officially disbanded, the members executed, and their property appropriated. Only the canine companion Halftail escaped the purge.\nShortly after these events, the Bright Ladys Tower was mysteriously abandoned and destroyed, with its archives transferred to Moonshadow Hall in Yhaunn. No temple of Sel没ne was ever rebuilt in Selgaunt.\nAfter investigating historical documents around the event, High Moonmistress Dhauna Myritar came to the conclusion that the temple falsified all charges of heresy in order to confiscate property and eliminate a potential rival faction of the faith."
