The Mosque of Bountiful Jisan was located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This temple could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
This mosque was one of the most lavish of all the temples to Zakharas great gods. Valuable tapestries, statues, and other symbols of wealth decorated the interior. The vault contained a veritable dragons hoard of treasure.
High Priest Imam Moral was the head of the mosque. He supervised over 250 lesser ranking priests of Jisan and other laymen.
A tasked guardian genie and a dao watched over the mosques vault.
The mosque of Jisan lent money to well-qualified applicants. All visitors to the mosque were expected to make a donation to honor Jisan. Generous donations guaranteed one a fine seat for a ceremony.
The bounty of Jisan concluded every ceremony. Priests summoned rain to moisten the faithful before servants brought food and wine for a feast. Proper form included only eating a little food during the feast. The faithful were encouraged to take food to give to beggars on their way home.
