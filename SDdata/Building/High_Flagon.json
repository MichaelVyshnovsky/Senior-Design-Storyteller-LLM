        "mainbody": "The '''High Flagon''' was a gambling hall and inn just north of [[Waterdeep]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].The location of the High Flagon was apparently [[wikipedia:en:retcon|retconned]] in ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' to be at the east edge of the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] near the North Gate (map key $76) and its full name was High Flagon Gambling House (see page 92). One possible explanation is that the business was so successful that the owners opened up a second establishment of the same name. Another possibility is that the owners moved the business inside the city walls for protection. As of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], it was owned by the [[Harbright]] family, with [[Drengar Harbright]] as proprietor and some of the Harbright women on the kitchen staff.{{Cite dragon/302/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The High Flagon|76}}",
        "Location": "The original High Flagon stood about two miles (just over three kilometers) up the [[Long Road]] from the North Gate of Waterdeep, on the right (east) side of the road. The location just outside Waterdeep became a popular meeting place for merchants, laborers, and adventurers joining a caravan for safer travels.\n[[File:HighFlagon-UpperStories.jpg|thumb|center|600px|''View of the myriad gables, turrets, and roofs added over the years. Many rain barrels store water in case of fire.'']]",
        "Structure": "[[File:HighFlagon-Barrels.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Patrons approach the front door. Cascading rain barrels are evident.'']]\nThe High Flagon on the Long Road was a country estate that suffered from having a series of owners that each expanded the structure in a different style and direction than the previous owner. As a result, the place looked like a tortured old house bristling with wings, gables, turrets, oddly sloped roofs, and bay windows. The entire front and part of one side had an attached veranda complete with its own roofs of various designs and a picket-fence railing. In the back were large stables for patrons' horses and carriages. A fence surrounded the Flagon and stables to form a yard that was often muddy in wet weather. Multi-tiered rain barrels were found all around the structure wherever gutters sluiced water off the roofs. These were kept full in case of a fire.Some descriptions are based on the artist's rendering.\n[[File:HighFlagon-Veranda.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A portion of the veranda that wrapped around the front and one side. More water barrels are present.'']]",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The High Flagon had a rustic feel but presented a respectable facade for a place known for harboring gambling, drinking, brawling, [[prostitution]], and [[drug]] sales. There were armed guards on every floor and around the grounds; stunningly beautiful hostesses in evening gowns; handsome and beautiful tablemasters that ran the games and provided dice, cards, markers, and banking services; a platoon of stable-hands; an equal number of cooks; and a deep menu of beverages to choose from.\n\nDuring the day shift, from dawn to dusk, the place operated at half staff as only a few indefatigable gamblers and drinkers were present. Rooms were quite inexpensive during the day and were often used for private business meetings. All tenants had to be out by dusk or pay the nighttime room rate to hold the room. At night, from dusk until dawn, the Flagon was fully staffed and awash in the noisy pursuit of pleasure and entertainment.\n\nThe rules of the house were fairly simple and strict. Patrons that repeatedly taunted, cheated, or started fights were ejected from the premises. Drawing a weapon or contributing to a death was also grounds for expulsion. Anyone caught starting a fire or acting in a manner that could start a fire (breaking a lamp, throwing a lantern, ''etc.'') was given a beating and then ejected. [[Magic]] was prohibited and anyone caught using magic to cheat was ejected and forbidden to ever return. Using magic in a dangerous, attacking, or violent manner was grounds for a beating and confiscation of all belongings on their person, or death if the offense was judged to be exceptionally serious.{{Cite dragon/302/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The High Flagon|77}}\n[[File:HighFlagon-Spyhole.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''What the guard sees.'']]"
        },
        "Services": "The room rate during the day was 3 [[sp]] for a basic room with no frills. At night, the price was 2 [[gp]] for the same room, but renters wanting a quiet night were better off going elsewhere. The wide variety of alcoholic beverages was one of the services that made the Flagon stand out. All drinks were served in the same-sized dented metal goblets that kept breakage to a minimum. [[Ale]]s, beers from small to stout, cordials made from [[herb]]s, and beef broth were all 3 sp per goblet. [[Wine]]s, [[zzar]], and strong spirits were 1 gp per goblet. The finer and rarer beverages began at 7 gp and went up to whatever the clientele would pay.\n[[File:HighFlagon-RoomCutaway.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Cutaway view of the spartan rooms on the upper floors.'']]\n\nFood at the Flagon was styled so as not to interfere with gaming, ''i.e.'', it was all finger-food that could be eaten with one hand. [[Tart]]s, both sweet and savory, were served hot on a wooden plate. Sweetberry tarts were filled with one or more of [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], cranberries, [[gooseberry|gooseberries]], or [[raspberry|raspberries]] and sold for 2 sp each. Savory tarts were filled with small game meat such as [[rabbit]] or [[quail]] and were 3 sp each. Higher up the price list were skewer-fowl: whole ducks, chickens, or other fowl of indeterminate age marinated in dregs from the wine bottles, roasted, and served on a wooden [[skewer|stake]]. The drippings from the skewer-fowl were used to fry thick slices of [[bread]]. Two of these slices were served on a wooden plate topped by four or five strips of beef, pork, and venison, also fried and heavily seasoned with pepper. This staple was known as a [[fryplate]].The source does not give a price for skewer-fowl or fryplates.\n\nWith an oversized, walled stable compound, many stable hands, and 'round-the-clock guards, the High Flagon had a side business of coach storage and mount boarding for folks in the city that didn't have room or didn't want to keep these assets at their place of residence. Guests at the Flagon knew their mounts were in good hands.\n\n{{Fq|width=250px|text=Handy for drownings.|source=A wry comment from a merchant about the many water barrels around the High Flagon.}}",
        "Activities": "The High Flagon used to host dice games (possibly [[Traitor's Heads]] or [[Thabort]], for example) and \"live\" games (like [[Toss the Dagger]], for example) but these led to an excess of brawling and were banned from the High Flagon by Drengar in the early 1370s DR. After the ban, only card games were allowed, but these were quite in vogue at the time and business did not suffer from the ban. Typical card games played nightly were [[Archers]], [[Smashcastle]], [[Swords (game)|Swords]], and the extremely popular [[High Dragon]]. Part of the reason for High Dragon's widespread appeal was that Drengar would occasionally raise the stakes and spur the excitement by adding some coins to the winner's pot.",
        "Defenses": "[[File:HighFlagon-Cellar.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Cutaway view of the cellar showing the counting table and a server retrieving a pitcher from one of the many casks of drinks.'']]\nThe High Flagon employed forty-six guards. About a third of these worked the day shift and the rest worked the night shift. Guests were well aware of this security presence as there were two guards stationed at the front doors, two at the copper lobby door, and two more flanking the hostess' stand. All three of these posts had an alarm gong that was linked to one in the kitchen area to alert the proprietor and summon reinforcements if necessary. Patrols roamed over the whole compound, including the cellar, the upper floors, the stables, and the fenced-in yard.\n\nSpare weapons were kept in the broom- and linen-closets used by the staff. Small sandbags were also stored there to be used for fighting fires or to throw at fighting guests. One of the ground-floor closets had a special foot-operated lever that allowed a part of the floor to swing aside so that items (or a body) could be quickly dropped into the cellar for hiding.",
        "History": "The building had many owners, as evidenced by the many mismatched styles of additions that it accumulated over the years. The Harbrights were successful in the textile business in Waterdeep but Drengar wanted to get his family out of the big city, so he took over the management of the High Flagon. It didn't take many seasons for the Flagon to become the more profitable family business."
