        "mainbody": "The '''Tower of Swift Death''' was a temple dedicated to [[Cyric]]. It was formerly committed to [[Bhaal]].",
        "Location": "This fortress was located outside the tharch of [[Thay]], [[Tyraturos (tharch)|Tyraturos]].",
        "Activities": "The Tower of Swift Death hosted multiple trained murderers and [[priest]]s. Such inhabitants were known to be recruited by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] for specific missions.",
        "History": "Prior to [[1370 DR]], the tower fortress was one of the final temples of Bhaal, after Cyric assumed his portfolio during the [[Time of Troubles]]. As Bhaal became a dead power, Cyric provided the priests of the tower [[spell]]s in the name of their former master. As of 1370 DR, the temple was run by Primate [[Oumrant Tsulkide]] and was funded by the Red Wizards of Thay. In such a year, the fortress converted to the worship of Cyric the Dark Sun."
