The Calling Horns was an inn, and later small settlement, south of the Evermoors, along the Evermoor Way east of Yartar where the Jundars Pass trail struck out south. 
It was named after the legendary battle where an army of humans and dwarves united to defeat the last army of trolls. 
Circa 1365 DR, it was run by a hunter named Tosker Nightsword.
After 1485 DR, the Calling Horns Inn was owned and run by Tamalin Zoar, expanding the location into a small settlement.
Aborana Startoucher lived here after fleeing Memnon.
