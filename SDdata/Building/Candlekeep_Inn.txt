==Location==

The tavern had two floors. The ground floor was where the bar was located, and contained a huge fireplace. Another fireplace was located in the entrance lounge, which also contained a few chairs, tables, and stools. The downstairs area also held the owner's room. The upper floor had only a landing and seven rooms, all of which seemed to be for guests only.
