        "mainbody": "The High Tower of Iriaebor was the residence of the Lord of the city, where the 40-member merchants council gathered.\nThe tower stood in the middle of a barren, walled courtyard. At the entrance of the tower stood two massive bronze gates.\nThe stone of the High Tower changed color a third way up of the tower. \nNearly the entire base of the tower was taken up by the Hall of Argument. Luminous frescoes decorated the ceiling, and hundreds of torches illuminated the room. At the end of some corridors, there were spiral staircases that led to the towers higher levels.\nThe topmost chamber of the tower was a room that was exquisitely decorated. The floor was made of dark polished marble. Exotic tapestries hung on the walls.\nThere were dungeons beneath the High Tower, though they were big, and therefore some areas of the dungeon have been abandoned. The Purple Masks Guild used this to their advantage, and they had a secret entrance that they use to get in and out of the dungeons.\nThe first quarry used to provide stone for the High Tower suffered a wall collapse that killed a score of laborers and even Eradabus, the first lord of Iriaebor everyone in the city knew the story. His successor, Melsar, started a new quarry, but the High Tower wasnt completed until the reign of the third lord, Saresia."
