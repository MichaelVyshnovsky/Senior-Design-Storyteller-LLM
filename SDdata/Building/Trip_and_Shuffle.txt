The '''Trip and Shuffle''' was a tavern in [[Targos]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], in the late 14{{th}} century{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

==Location==
[[File:Targos.jpg|thumb|300px|''A map of Targos showing the location of the Trip and Shuffle.'']]
The building was located on or near the southern wall of town.

==Atmosphere==
The tavern was known as a chaotic place in the 1370s DR, not for gentle souls. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the tavern had a large blazing hearth by one of the taproom's walls and a small stage for [[bard]]s and [[minstrel]]s to perform for the guests.

==Services==
Trip and Shuffle served a homey stew of meat, [[potato]]es, and [[carrot]]s, accompanied by [[ale]], in the late 15{{th}} century DR.

==Staff==
In the early 1370s DR, the Trip and Shuffle was operated by a man named [[Russell]], who was living in Targos to escape a death sentence that he'd received in [[Cormyr]] as a disgraced [[Purple Dragon]].

==History==
In the late 1480s DR, the ex-[[Harper]] [[bard]] and struggling single father [[Edgin Darvis]] went to the Trip and Shuffle for a bowl of stew, a tankard of ale, and milk for his infant daughter, [[Kira]], but nodded off to sleep with the cooing baby next to him. When he woke, he found [[Holga Kilgore]] cradling Kira after she'd kept an eye on the newborn and let the father get some sleep. Though he briefly reacted badly, fearing a stranger taking his child, the two became firm friends. In the years after, the Trip and Shuffle tavern became the favored haunt of the thieves Edgin, Holga, Kira, [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], a place where they would plan, celebrate, and make [[music]].

In the mid-1490s DR, they were met here by [[Sofina]], who hired them to rob [[Korinn's Keep]].{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} After their crimes caught up with them, in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Edgin and Holga escaped the [[Revel's End]] prison and returned to Targos. They had a drink at the Trip and Shuffle to discuss their plans, though the barkeep mistook them for a married couple, which they were amused and offended by. Finding a flyer advertising the [[High Sun Games]] and that Forge had become Lord of [[Neverwinter]], they departed for that city.
