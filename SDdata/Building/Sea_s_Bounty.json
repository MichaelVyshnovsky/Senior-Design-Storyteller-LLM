        "mainbody": "The '''Sea's Bounty''' was a [[tavern]] in [[Athkatla]], located near the city's docks. It contained two floors, both of which were cramped.",
        "Interior": "The bottom floor contained the bar room, manned by a large man called [[The Thumb]], which was cozy for such a small tavern. It held a large fire burner, sitting areas, bookshelves and many paintings. The bar room was themed around the sea, hence the tavern's name, and attracted many sailors and nobles. Behind a painting was a secret passage to a cavern, where a group of [[pirate]]s held up.\n\nThe top floor was a well furnished common area, containing beds, heat sources and dressers. Commoners, sailors and some nobles would accommodate this floor.",
        "Services": "The Sea's Bounty Tavern sold a good range of beers, as well as food. Despite its small size, it managed to provide beds for all societal classes."
