        "mainbody": "he Seas Bounty was a tavern in Athkatla, located near the citys docks. It contained two floors, both of which were cramped.\nThe bottom floor contained the bar room, manned by a large man called The Thumb, which was cozy for such a small tavern. It held a large fire burner, sitting areas, bookshelves and many paintings. The bar room was themed around the sea, hence the taverns name, and attracted many sailors and nobles. Behind a painting was a secret passage to a cavern, where a group of pirates held up.\nThe top floor was a well furnished common area, containing beds, heat sources and dressers. Commoners, sailors and some nobles would accommodate this floor.\nThe Seas Bounty Tavern sold a good range of beers, as well as food. Despite its small size, it managed to provide beds for all societal classes."
