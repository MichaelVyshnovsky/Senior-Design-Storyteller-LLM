        "mainbody": "The Shou Embassy in the city of Bral was the home of the embassy of the Empire of Shou Lung on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe Shou Embassy was located in the Low City on the docking, or leading, edge of the Rock,\nThe Embassy did not look like it belonged among all the warehouses of the docking edge. It was an ornate building of clearly Shou architecture. The cornices of its roof had crouching gilded dragons, and sculpted bronze snarling foo creatures guarded the doors.\nThe building was divided into many small but fancy inner rooms for receiving guests.\nAs late as 1367 DR, Lord Chan Fu Wi served as ambassador for Shou Lung. He was in magical direct contact with the imperial court on Toril by means of a wu jen assistant."
