        "mainbody": "The '''Wyrmworks''' was a shop in [[Silverymoon]] that specialized in [[dragon]] parts and [[map]]s related to dragon locations and lairs. It also had a [[magic]]ally animated [[red dragon]] head for rent. This shop was established ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.{{Cite dragon/322/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Wyrmworks|84}}",
        "Location": "This establishment was located on [[Many Cats Lane]], a side street in the [[Northbank]] section of Silverymoon.",
        "Structure": "The building was almost four stories tall because the windowless ground-floor shop area had a vaulted dome for a ceiling. Above this were two more stories that had walk-out balconies and bay windows. The exterior was made of stone and had [[slate]] roofs. Off to the left side was an attached workshop. A large sign, ornately carved like a coiled dragon, hung out front advertising \"The Wyrmworks\".{{Cite dragon/322/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Wyrmworks|85}}<ref group=\"note\">Some descriptions are based on the artist's rendering.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The owners, [[Roryk]] and [[Delgrath]], were almost fanatical about dragons and loved to hear any news about sightings, encounters, or all-out campaigns involving dragons, and had their own stories to tell anyone who was interested. They kept track of any reports about lair occupancy or active hunting grounds in the region.\n\nCustomers in the shop were never left alone to browse by themselves; there was always at least one staff member present in the showroom. If a request was made for something that was kept in the back room, more staff members were summoned by ringing a handbell and asked to fetch the item."
        },
        "Services": "The Wyrmworks sold dragon fangs, talons, skin, scales, tails, bones, organs, eyes (preserved in jars), wings, blood, and anything else (including victim remains) that could be found in a dragon lair or had been touched by a dragon. Most of the rare and expensive items were kept in the back room and were only brought out upon request. This applied to the more detailed maps and difficult-to-harvest items like blood and organs. Old Roaring Rage and the Thaurongol sculpture were not for sale, but small replicas of them crafted by other local [[dwarven]] smiths in various metals could be had for 200 to 400 [[gold piece]]s depending on size and appearance. These were also kept in the back room.\n\nThere were no price tags on any of the merchandise in the Wyrmworks; all sales were negotiated by haggling. The owners (both grizzled old former adventurers) had no reservations about raising prices on people they didn't like or believed could become a danger to themselves or society, especially [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards]] or agents of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], but it was usually supply and demand that guided the haggling.\n\nThis shop also purchased dragon bits from adventurers, typically paying sixty percent of what they expected to sell the item for, but the price could vary from fifty to seventy-five percent depending on supply and demand.",
        "Activities": "{{Fq|text=We leave such matters to experts who desire to keep their work a mystery, and we dare not offend them lest we lose access to their services.|source=Standard staff response to those seeking trade secrets.}}\nThe owners and some of the staff spent a fair amount of time in the workshop cleaning and preserving various parts of dragon corpses. The solvents, cleaning agents, oils, and preservative solutions they used were considered trade secrets and the staff politely refused to sell, allow examination, or talk about them.{{Cite dragon/322/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Wyrmworks|87}}",
        "Defenses": "[[File:Wyrmworks-trap.png|thumb|right|250px|''Cutaway view of the deceptively loose roof tiles that conceal wire noose traps.'']]\nMost of the staff, except Alrue, were also Roryk and Delgrath's bodyguards. Alrue was given a ''[[potion of invisibility]]'' with instructions to use it to follow the perpetrators if she ever witnessed a burglary, and report back to the owners as quickly as possible. All the ground-floor doors were equipped with portcullises that could be dropped by activating one of the levers located on the upper floors in the living quarters. These were routinely lowered when the staff was away, during deliveries of valuable goods, or whenever suspicious activity was detected.\n\nSome of the slate tiles on the lowest part of the roofs were deceptively loose and contained noose [[trap]]s made with sturdy [[wire]]. If someone moved a tile and reached or inserted anything into the revealed cavity, it was snared in a wire noose and a bell rang in the second-floor guardroom.\n\n[[File:Wyrmworks-doorframe.png|thumb|right|250px|''Realistic-looking dragon talons decorated the doorframes of all doors to the stairs.'']]\nA coin vault was located under the stairs to the cellar. It was accessed by removing a stone in the wall and operating a lever that released one of the steps, allowing it to be lifted up. All doorways that led to the stairs were decorated with what appeared to be dragon talons around the frames. It was hoped that the unusual appearance would discourage thieves or at least distract them into stealing something worthless. The adornments were actually made from rothé horn, reptile hide, and [[clay]].",
        "History": "The Wyrmworks opened sometime around 1371 DR and business was very slow at the beginning—the market for dragon bits having a very limited and specialized consumer base. But just over a year later, word had spread and their services were in such demand that the owners were considering opening another store in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Inhabitants": "* [[Roryk]]: Co-owner and a veteran [[human]] [[fighter]].\n* [[Delgrath]]: Co-owner and an accomplished human [[sorcerer]].\n* [[Alrue Crownshield]]: A young, human woman from [[Calimshan]], shop girl, workshop technician, and floor sweeper. Unknown to her employers and people in general, this was her alternate form, as she was actually an [[Dragon aging|adult]] [[song dragon]]."
