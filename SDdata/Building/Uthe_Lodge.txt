'''Uthe Lodge''' was the [[Eveningstar]] home of the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}

|What I mean by overgrown is — overgrown! Plants and vines and what have you. Coming out the windows, the roof. I took one look inside and that was it for me. Someone's got to do something before the overgrowth grows… over!

==Location==
Peron's home was located on the eastern edge of Eveningstar, next to the [[Starwater River]].

==Structure==
The lodge was a stately, spacious three-story home with a basement level. After its primal invasion, it became filled with thick vines, roots, and other greenery that altered the layout significantly. The basement connected onto a small natural cavern via a hidden passageway.

==History==

|Forest, spreading throughout the house? As if the house had caught the disease! This is deeply troubling.

Uthe Lodge had been a part of the Uthe family for generations, who served as rangers and foresters for the region. During the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], Peron Uthe returned home from a jaunt to [[Thorngap]] in the [[King's Forest]] where he met the [[druid]] [[Halsaime]]. He had been infected with a strange disease created by the druid, causing him to sicken and slowly transform into a [[red musk zombie]]. He went to the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] for treatment, causing a disaster there as he turned more patients into zombies before he was eventually being destroyed by hired [[adventurer]]s.

At his abandoned home, a group of Halsaime's servants took residence, led the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]] and the [[wood woad]]s [[Robur]], [[Prinus]], and [[Falcata]]. They were supported by a force of red musk zombies, [[vine horror]]s, [[Will-o'-wisp|wisps]], and a pack of [[wolves]] that lived at Peron's home. The lodge became choked with quick-growing plants that filled the interior and crept up the outside of the building, turning it into a dank, humid labyrinth that smelled of rotting vegetation. The dryad's tree, planted in the basement level, even grew up and through the top of the roof. If not stopped, Sylvie planned to extend this growth further and destroy the village of Eveningstar. Fortunately, the healer [[Eolynn Arva]] caught sight of the astounding overgrowth and searched for help, finding the same group that dealt with Peron earlier.

Unbeknownst to this group, a parallel investigation was being performed by a group of [[Harpers]] in search of [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]. They wished to find him through Halsaime and so sought Peron's assistance only to arrive too late. The [[bard]] [[Jussko Kwahn]] infiltrated the lodge to determine what had happened to Peron Uthe and eventually teamed up with the adventurers as they fought their way past the defenders and destroyed the dryad Sylvie, potentially finding the ''[[wall of wood]]'' or ''[[forester's brush hook]]'' in the mess.

Without Peron or the dryad, the overgrowth was contained and Eveningstar was saved from another threat. This led to the Harpers continuing the investigation into Halsaime, eventually finding and killing him at the [[Druid's Deep]].
