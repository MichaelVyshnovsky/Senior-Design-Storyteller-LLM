Uthe Lodge was the Eveningstar home of the ranger Peron Uthe in the late 15 century DR.
Perons home was located on the eastern edge of Eveningstar, next to the Starwater River.
The lodge was a stately, spacious three-story home with a basement level. After its primal invasion, it became filled with thick vines, roots, and other greenery that altered the layout significantly. The basement connected onto a small natural cavern via a hidden passageway.

Unbeknownst to this group, a parallel investigation was being performed by a group of Harpers in search of Oriphaun Huntsilver. They wished to find him through Halsaime and so sought Perons assistance only to arrive too late. The bard Jussko Kwahn infiltrated the lodge to determine what had happened to Peron Uthe and eventually teamed up with the adventurers as they fought their way past the defenders and destroyed the dryad Sylvie, potentially finding the wall of wood or foresters brush hook in the mess.
Without Peron or the dryad, the overgrowth was contained and Eveningstar was saved from another threat. This led to the Harpers continuing the investigation into Halsaime, eventually finding and killing him at the Druids Deep.
