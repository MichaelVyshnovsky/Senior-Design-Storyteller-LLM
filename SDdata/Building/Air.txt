The element of air was one of the four fundamental building blocks of matter, and the origin of everything that was gaseous. It represented change, flexibility, and freedom.
Air manifested its position in the cosmos as the Elemental Plane of Air, one of the Inner Planes. The element was also represented there in living form as air elementals.
The ruler over the portfolio of air in Faerûn and Zakhara was the elemental lord Akadi—in the Hordelands known as Teylas—while it was held by Enlil in the Untheric and Qotal in the Maztican pantheon. Among demihuman deities, Aerdrie Faenya of the elves held dominion over air. The archomental Yan-C-Bin also announced his wish to dominate the element by calling himself Master of Evil Air, as did, by her very name, the Queen of Air and Darkness.
A number of Torilian powers were concerned less directly with the elemental aspect but with moving air, either as beneficial wind—Bahamut, Eha, Hakiyah, Haku, Valkur—or destructive storm—Anhur, Talos, Umberlee (at sea), and Set (in the desert).
Many magical spells utilized the element of air. Elemental air was recognized as a "school of effect" (rather than one of the eight traditional schools of magic). Wizards specializing in this school were called air elementalists.In some areas of the world of Mystara, air elementalists were called aeromancers. Air was opposed to the element of earth, both as a school of magic and as a worldview.
Magic-users in Zakhara had a similar, but not identical, notion of air magic in the form of the province of wind. These individuals were called wind mages.
A number of deities granted divine spells that relied on the element, either in the form of the elemental air sphere, or the air domain.
Spacefarers also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the crystal spheres.|74-76 The one major air body in Realmspace was the gas giant Coliar.>
