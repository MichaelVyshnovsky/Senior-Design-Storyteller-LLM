The element of '''air''' was one of the four fundamental building blocks of matter,<ref> and the origin of everything that was gaseous. It represented change, flexibility, and freedom.

==Cosmology==
Air manifested its position in the cosmos as the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], one of the [[Inner Planes]].<ref> The element was also represented there in living form as [[air elemental]]s.

The ruler over the [[portfolio]] of air in [[Faerûn]] and [[Zakhara]] was the [[elemental lord]] [[Akadi]]<ref>—in the [[Hordelands]] known as Teylas<ref>—while it was held by [[Enlil]] in the [[Untheric pantheon|Untheric]]<ref><ref> and [[Qotal]] in the [[Maztican pantheon]].<ref> Among [[demihuman]] deities, [[Aerdrie Faenya]] of the [[elves]] held dominion over air.<ref> The [[archomental]] [[Yan-C-Bin]] also announced his wish to dominate the element by calling himself Master of Evil Air,<ref> as did, by her very name, the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]].<ref>

A number of [[Toril]]ian powers were concerned less directly with the elemental aspect but with moving air, either as beneficial wind—[[Bahamut]],<ref> [[Eha]],<ref> [[Hakiyah]], [[Haku]],<ref> [[Valkur]]<ref>—or destructive storm—[[Anhur]],<ref> [[Talos]],<ref> [[Umberlee]] (at sea),<ref> and [[Set]] (in the desert).<ref>

==Magic==
===School of Elemental Air===
Many [[magic]]al spells utilized the element of air.<ref> Elemental air was recognized as a "school of effect" (rather than one of the eight traditional [[schools of magic]]).<ref> Wizards specializing in this school were called [[elementalist|air elementalists]].In some areas of the world of [[Mystara]], air elementalists were called aeromancers.<ref> Air was opposed to the [[element of earth]], both as a school of magic and as a worldview.<ref>

Magic-users in Zakhara had a similar, but not identical, notion of air magic in the form of the [[Wind (province)|province of wind]]. These individuals were called [[Elemental mage|wind mages]].<ref>

===Divine Air Magic===
A number of deities granted [[Divine magic|divine spells]] that relied on the element, either in the form of the [[elemental air sphere]],<ref> or the [[air domain]].<ref><ref>

==Celestial Bodies==
[[Spelljammer|Spacefarers]] also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the [[crystal sphere]]s.<ref>|74-76}} The one major air body in [[Realmspace]] was the gas giant [[Coliar]].<ref>><ref>
