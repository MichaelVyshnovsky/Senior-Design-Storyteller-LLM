        "mainbody": "'''Falcon's hunting lodge''' was the only safe retreat for travelers in the southern reaches of [[Neverwinter Wood]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It belonged to [[Gustaf Stellern]], who was called Falcon the Hunter. He catered to wealthy people from [[Neverwinter]] who were looking for a break from city life. Falcon employed the cook [[Corwin]] and the stablehand [[Pell]].",
        "Description": "The main lodge was a two-story building with the heads of dead [[orc]]s hanging as trophies on the walls of the dining hall. A fortified tower was attached to the main house. Additionally, the compound included a guest house, a connected two-story stable house and smithy, a gatehouse and an outhouse. There were also pens on the hunting lodge grounds for two dozen chickens and a rooster, six pigs, and four goats. In his pantry, Falcon stored enough supplies for an entire season. The whole compound was protected against the forest wildlife by a {{SIAdj|10|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} log palisade. A narrow stone bridge allowed crossing the [[Neverwinter River]] at the hunting lodge.",
        "Geography": "[[File:Neverwinter Wood Map.jpg|thumb|''Map of the Neverwinter Wood with the position of Falcon's hunting lodge marked.'']]\nThe hunting lodge was located in the south of the [[Neverwinter Wood]], on the east bank of a tributary of the [[Neverwinter River]].",
        "Services": "Food and stays in the simple guest house were free but a stay in the deluxe guest room cost 10 [[gp]] per night. Falcon also offered his survival skills to anybody in need of a guide.",
        "History": "Following the appearance of the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] in the [[Sword Mountains]], Falcon noticed an alliance of orcs from the south and the [[half-orc]] [[anchorites of Talos]] had gathered in the [[Woodland Manse]] not far from his hunting lodge. He reached out to [[Phandalin]] to hire some adventurers to make a preemptive strike against them. In retaliation, a band of twenty orcs attacked Falcon's hunting lodge. The anchorites of [[Talos]] also conjured [[Gorthok]] the Thunder Boar to aid their attack."
