'''The Ancient Scrolls''' was a business that provided historical lore services in [[Eileanar]], the famed [[enclave]] of [[Karsus]].

==Location==
The Scrolls were in the outer southwestern part of the city, very close to the [[Alchemical Seminary]].

==Services==
The five sages within the Scrolls had unique skills and areas of interest, and as a whole they specialized in the history of [[Netheril]] back to its [[First Age]], as well as the recorded non-[[human]] societies that had existed during that time.
