The Ancient Scrolls was a business that provided historical lore services in Eileanar, the famed enclave of Karsus.
The Scrolls were in the outer southwestern part of the city, very close to the Alchemical Seminary.
The five sages within the Scrolls had unique skills and areas of interest, and as a whole they specialized in the history of Netheril back to its First Age, as well as the recorded non-human societies that had existed during that time.
