The Palace of Alon was the home of the Padishah and royal family of Medina al-Afyal in 1367 DR.
The Palace was found in Medina al-Afyal on the island of Afyal in Bahr al-Ajami in east Zakhara. The structure flanked the city proper.
The Palace consisted of many smaller spired and domed structures, most of which were connected by causeways. It was considered to be one of the finest architectural achievements throughout the Land of Fate. Both magical and mundane methods were used during its construction.
Five dao worked tirelessly to continually maintain the Palace.
