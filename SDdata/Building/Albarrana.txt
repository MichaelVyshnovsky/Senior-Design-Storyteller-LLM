Albarranas were the fortresses used by efreet for defensive purposes that were scattered across their vast empire.
Each efreet thurgur could have up to four albarranas within its borders.
These fortresses were composed of rock, brick, and a special concrete made from volcanic rock.
Between 1,000 and 5,000 efreet soldiers were garrisoned at each albarrana. They were commanded by a single noble efreeti. When in the field, these heavily armed units were usually accompanied by special guides and scouts called dalil.
