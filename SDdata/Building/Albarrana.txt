'''Albarranas''' were the fortresses used by [[efreet]] for defensive purposes that were scattered across their vast empire.

==Location==
Each efreet [[thurgur]] could have up to four albarranas within its borders.

==Description==
These fortresses were composed of rock, brick, and a special concrete made from volcanic rock.

==Inhabitants==
Between 1,000 and 5,000 efreet soldiers were garrisoned at each albarrana. They were commanded by a single [[noble efreeti]]. When in the field, these heavily armed units were usually accompanied by special guides and scouts called ''dalil''.
