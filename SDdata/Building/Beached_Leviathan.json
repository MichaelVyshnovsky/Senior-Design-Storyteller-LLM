        "Description": "Because of the nature of his establishment and his past career as a pirate, [[Harrag]] used nautical terms to differentiate the various areas in his tavern. So, the first floor was named \"''the Hold''\", the second \"''the Quarters''\", and the third \"''the Deck''\". An open-sided spiral stair connected the three levels, winding around the central mast. In addition, a 5-foot-by-5-foot shaft connected all three levels, allowing a hoist platform to move supplies from one level to the other. The platform was operated from the deck by using a boom on the central mast.{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|57}} \n\n\"''The Hold''\" contained the kitchen and the bar area, decorated with nautical equipment and some of the trophies Harrag accumulated during his pirate career. The trophies included [[sahuagin]] skulls and weapons, preserved [[shark]] fins, and a giant crab's carapace. A secret door in the bar area allowed entrance to the bilge, which housed Harrag's personal treasures.\n\n\"''The Quarters''\" served as the inn area, with nine small rooms, two larger suites, and a mid-sized room. The larger rooms contained stoves for tenants who wished to prepare their own meals. On the starboard side of the ship, a platform called \"''the Stardeck''\" provided an exterior seating area.\n\n\"''The Deck''\" had a seating zone in its central area. For a hefty price, patrons could rent one of the pair of private parlors located here. The aft had storage rooms, atop of which were located Harrag's personal quarters.",

        "Services": "After its opening, the Beached Leviathan became the most popular place in Neverwinter for drinking and gambling. The tavern often hosted troupes of entertainers who performed in \"''the Hold''\" and on \"''the Deck''\". When these entertainers performed on \"''the Deck''\", those within the tavern could hear the music from any point within the ship.\n\nIn addition to providing a good time for her patrons, the Beached Leviathan was also home to many seedy goings-on, both legal and illegal. At any given time, people of Neverwinter converged here to arrange trade deals, broker in stolen goods, exchange information of all kinds, or to plot. The dealings that took place in the tavern rarely went unnoticed by [[Dagult Neverember]]'s agents, who frequented the bar at all hours.\n\nA type of amber [[ale]], aptly called [[Leviathan ale]] was the tavern's house brew. One of the special drinks served at the Beached Leviathan was [[Dwarven Celebration Brew]], also known as the \"Liquid Courage.\" Among food items offered, the guests could try liberally [[spices|spiced]] [[Sword Mountains spice cake|cakes]] from the [[Sword Mountains]], strange and exotic [[Neverwinter spider stew]], simple [[Helm's Hold Journeybread]]s, and order [[Traveler's Feast]] to go.",
        "History": "[[File:Before the Storm Tavern.png|thumb|''The Beached Leviathan's interior.'']]\nThe Beached Leviathan was once the ship ''Leviathan'', owned by a pirate named Harrag,{{Cite dungeon/193/Tavern Profile:The Beached Leviathan|56}}\n\nAt some point before [[1479 DR]], the ''Leviathan'' ran aground during a storm before the [[Docks District (Neverwinter)|Docks]] of Neverwinter had been rebuilt, Unable to use his ship to sail ever again, Harrag refurbished the ''Leviathan'', transforming it into a tavern that soon became popular because of its shape. Harrag was able to open the Beached Leviathan thanks to the patronage of Dagult Neverember, making the tavern a popular spot among his sympathizers.\n\nIn 1479 DR, when a \"[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]]\" of the [[Alagondar]] bloodline made public his claim to the throne of Neverwinter, a crowd of furious citizens attacked the Beached Leviathan because Harrag was a loyalist of Neverember. Luckily for him, General [[Sabine]] was in the tavern hiring adventurers to investigate the \"Lost Heir\", and her men and the adventurers were able to placate the crowd before they could damage the tavern.\n\nA few months later, while investigating a series of kidnappings that had been taking place in Neverwinter, the city guard escorted a group of adventurers to the Beached Leviathan in an attempt to dissuade them from meddling too much in current events. The guards were ambushed and killed by a group of [[Ashmadai]] cultists and their summoned [[devil]]s, which attacked the Beached Leviathan and mind-controlled some of the patrons present at the time. Luckily, the adventurers were able to deal with the situation, kill the cultists and devils, and free the patrons of the cultists' magic, earning the gratitude of Harrag and his \"crew\". The Beached Leviathan became even more popular after this event."
