The Netheril Mint in Eileanar was one of three mints that produced official currency within the realm of ancient Netheril.
The Mint lay on the southern edge of the city, near the Museum of Heavy Magic.
The Mint was shaped like a pyramid, similar to the coins it made.
The Mint employed a total of 100 staff and guards as it produced the distinctive coinage of Netheril, pyramid-shaped metal coins that had a three-dimensional image of a flying enclave within the pyramidal facings. The arcanists Elgiva and Evemerus oversaw the group of wizards who created these illusions, which ensured that the coins could not be counterfeited. The square base of the coin was marked with the bust of Nether the Elder, as well as the phrase "E Magicus Unum" and a "K" for the enclave of its manufacture.
The building was heavily protected by magical wards that prevented any possible magical ingress or egress, and was heavily patrolled and watched by both magical and mundane means. The guards were led by Everdingen and his lieutenants Szematseen and Fieschi with the assistance of the priest Debac, who watched the front doors and used divination magics to prevent any theft or sabotage. The punishment for any attempted theft was usually a quick execution, or slightly slower execution via banishment to the Negative Energy plane.
