        "mainbody": "Chonis Temple was the name given to a ruined structure in western Cormyr. It lay east of Eagle Peak, in the foothills of the Stormhorns.\nThe ruins were thought to have once been a temple, and prominently bore the name \"Chonis\", written in the Thorass alphabet, a feature it shared with the Tomb of Chonis. Hence, it was called \"Chonis Temple\". None knew who or what Chonis was, however some speculated it was a long-forgotten deity, demigod, or fiend."
