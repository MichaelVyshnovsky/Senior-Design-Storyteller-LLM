==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, when the [[Luskar]] waged war on the island of [[Ruathym]] and pillaged its city of the same name, the Hall of the Black Waves was left untouched by the invaders.

Around [[1358 DR]], the head priest of the temple was one [[Uther Jeroggean]], a male [[shaman]]. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, sometime after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the rulers of Ruathym ruled from within the Hall of the Black Waves, such as First Axe [[Vok Dorrg]].
