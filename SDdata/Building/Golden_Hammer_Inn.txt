The '''Golden Hammer Inn''' was a seedy nondescript inn in [[Waterdeep]], ''circa'' late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The inn's main distinction was a trapdoor that opened into the dangerous and monster-infested [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers]] of the City of Splendors.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Golden Hammer Inn became a hub of operations for a group of heroes from [[Silverymoon]] who arrived at Waterdeep on the call to arms placed by the [[Lords' Alliance]] following a dramatic increase of thief, assassin, and monster activity pouring from [[Undermountain]]. Along with the Silvaeren adventurers, a group of heroes handpicked by [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] visited the inn on several occasions during their delves into the City of Splendors' underworld, opposing [[Xanathar]] and its criminal alliance.

==Inhabitants==
The number of employees of the Golden Hammer Inn was unknown; however, only they were allowed to use the inn's trapdoor into the sewers. The inn did business with the guests from the sewers on quite a few occasions.

Apart from regular services, in the late 14{{th}} century DR, the inn had a [[cleric]] on staff who offered his healing powers for some [[gold]] pieces. [[Thurd Morningstar]] was a talent agent of sorts who operated out of the inn and helped to connect adventuring parties with individuals in search of fame and fortune. One such adventurer was an eccentric [[rock gnome]] [[wizard]] [[Knucklebone]]. Additionally, three [[dwarf|dwarven]] traders set up a shop in the inn - [[Woryn]], who traded in quality dwarven armor, [[Roryn]], who dealt in arms, and [[Goryn]], who sold miscellany created by "those pointy-eared people."
