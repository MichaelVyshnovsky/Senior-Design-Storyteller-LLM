The surrounding land was rolling and studded with low brush, with the occasional copse of [[tree]]s or thicket of [[bamboo]], which were cleared to a distance of {{SI|120|yard|long=yes}} away from the roads and the inn. Thus there was little in the way of a stealthy approach.\n\nThe inn itself was surrounded by an orchard and an inn pond, or ''doi-ike''. The orchard grew dozens of fruit trees of different kinds over a grassy field.",
        "Structure": "[[File:Doi No Fugu.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''The layout of Doi No Fugu.'']]\nA walled compound, it comprised four main buildings: the large inn house itself along the northern side, the stable in the southwest corner, the small master's house in the south, and a pavilion, or [[Kozakuran_dictionary#I|''izumi-dono'']], which stood in the [[Kozakuran_dictionary#D|''doi-iki'']] in the southeast. with the former two buildings built of stone, the latter two of wood. All sported red clay tile roofs and ceilings {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} high, while the stable had a ceiling {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nThe inn house, stable, and master's house were linked by a curtain wall of dressed limestone {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in height and {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in thickness, while the pond provided a water barrier in the northeast, with the curtain wall ending in stone pillars {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} standing in the water. It had two gates: the main inn gate and the small orchard gate. The main gate was fashioned from [[iron]] bars set into two thick wooden baulks that were [[mortar]]ed into the curtain wall. The whole gate and baulks were painted bright red, several charms were pasted onto the sides, and a golden [[bell]] was mounted on the right baulk. A thick [[yew]] hedge around the western, northern, and eastern walls and shrubs along the southern provided an additional barrier. Beyond them the inn was surrounded by orchards.\n\nThe main gate led into a courtyard, some 30×40 feet (9×12 meters) in size, from which the other buildings were accessed: the broad porch and main entrance to the inn house in the east, the stable in the south, a flagstoned terrace backed by a bed of jade plants in the west against the curtain wall, and more generally the gardens.\n\nThe gardens featured trees, shrubbery, and beds of flowers, with occasional statues, with a statue of Emperor Mori on the right side of the inn house porch and a fountain on the left. The gardens were traversed by tidy paths of crushed stone. Four open verandahs with removable lattice-work panels for screens looked out onto the garden from the inn house and master's house. These were raised {{SI|1.5|ft|long=yes}} off the ground, while the one in the west was on an earthen bank against the curtain wall along the courtyard. This terrace was paved with flagstones and the sloped banks sprouted jade plants. A small garden shed was tucked away in the northwest corner.\n\nA tile-roofed covered walkway led over the pond to the ''izumi-dono''. Both were built on wooden pylons standing in the pond. The pavilion was surrounded by a porch.",

            "Pavilion": "Reached by a covered walkway, the pavilion, ''izumi-dono'', stood in the center of the pond, all raised on wooden pylons driven into the lakebed. Used for parties, the pavilion had a party room with a low black lacquered table and six black silk cushions. Balsa wood screens could be slid open so guests could look over the pond. On one side was a serving area with counter and shelves holding serving trays, dishes, crockery, condiment bottles, half-a-dozen [[sashimi]] knives, and a {{SIAdj|4|quart|long=yes}} jug of [[oil]].",

It contained a living room, a privy, and a bedroom for the couple, the latter with a platform bed and sleeping silks and a large lacquered cabinet for personal possessions. The floor panel concealed a false bottom and a cache storing the family's wealth, some 200 [[ch'ao]], 10 [[chi'ien]], and two strings of 100 [[fen]]. There was also a family shrine with an altar, which houses dozens of urns holding the ashes of their ancestors.",
            "Stable": "The stable included stalls for guests' mounts and pack animals, as well as the two light horses owned by the Sumitomos. Some stalls accommodated two animals, and their tack was hung on the sides of the stalls. The floor was earth and the loft stored hay. An adjoining tack room held spare pieces for riding or hitching, as well as a small forge suited to making minor repairs to harness."

        "History": {
            "Later History": "Since that time, Sumitomo Tomy endeavored to establish Doi no Fugu's reputation as a place of peace and the inn prospered, always protected by the emperors. He became one of the greatest chefs of Kozakura and even nobles of court followed the emperor's example in journeying to Maeshi Province simply to dine at Doi no Fugu. Only a few dared violate the peace and risk the wrath of the emperor or shogun, and were easily taken care of by the inn's security.\n\nAfter Tomy's death, ownership of the inn was passed from father to eldest son down through the centuries and the generations. Tomy had instituted a rule that the eldest son and any family member who would become a chef must be sent away to undertake his apprenticeship elsewhere, not with their parents at the inn. This was so they would learn and bring back new cooking techniques, saving the menu at Doi No Fugu ever growing stale.",
            "Modern History": "This pattern was interrupted around {{YearlinkConvert|1426|KY}} when [[Sumitomo Koji]] sent his son [[Sumitomo Yoichi|Yoichi]] off to an apprenticeship, and he disappeared. Seven years passed, in which time Sumitomo Toyo took his brother's place as successor but the growing threat of war now in Kozakura meant he could not yet go on his apprenticeship. For the same reason, Koji took on a ronin, [[Haka Kinnori]], for security. Later, Kinnori instructed the children Toyo and Skoshi in [[karate]] and told them stories of adventure and war, taking something of their lost brother's place in their hearts.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Hail, noble adventurers!

        "Atmosphere": "Thanks to the imperial decree, Doi No Fugu was customarily treated as neutral ground and a place of sanctuary. It seemed a serene and even enchanted place. It typically saw more business in the summer with visiting nobles and travelers from far-off lands, and less in the cold winter.",
        "Services": "On arrival, guests would ring the bell at the gate and staff would let them in, taking their horses and baggage. The innkeeper or his wife greeted them and escorted them into the inn house. In the Receiving Room, guests removed their shoes and were provided with ''[[tabi]]'', socks, to wear indoors. In the Place of Bountiful Welcome, a hospitality ritual incorporating a tea ceremony was practiced to signify accepting the inn's hospitality, while refusing the tea was considered improper by Kozakuran custom. Next, guests were treated to a bath in the bathroom and were given fresh [[kimono]]s; again, refusing either was improper. Finally, they were served meals and beds were set up for them in one of the rooms.\n\nA typical breakfast was a pot of strong green tea, a bowl of cold ''[[umeboshi]]'' (sour pickled [[plum]]s), and bowls of rice with sheets of ''[[nori]]'' (dried seaweed) to be eaten with the rice. They would also make [[fugu]] that was safe to eat.\n\nDrinks included [[tea]], [[beer]], [[plum wine]], and [[sake]].\n\nAfter a banquet, the geisha would entertain guests by playing music or performing a ''noh'' play such as \"The Reward of Tomy\".",
        "Staff & Inhabitants": "A family business, the inn was traditionally owned and run by the head of the Sumitomo family and inherited by the eldest son. Other members of the family would live and work there, some for a little time, others all their lives. They cooked, cleaned, carried luggage, entertained like [[geisha]], and tended to livestock and guests' mounts. ''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|1433|KY}}, the inn was staffed by the father [[Sumitomo Koji]] and mother [[Sumitomo Haru]] and their children [[Sumitomo Miko|Miko]], [[Sumitomo Myoki|Myoki]], [[Sumitomo Toyo|Toyo]], [[Sumitomo Skoshi|Skoshi]].",
        "Defenses": "In times of strife, the inn usually employed a single [[ronin]] for security.\n\nIn addition, the inn included secret doors and passages, with one leading to the cellar and another leading from the cellar to a hidden chamber that served as a refuge in the unthinkable event someone would assault the inn. The cellar was known only to the Sumitomos and the original builder of the inn, and the hidden chamber only to the Sumitomos, for they had installed it afterward.\n\nOtherwise, only the inn house had locks and bars for security, with bars on its exterior doors, while the inn gate had a lock and padlocked chain and the orchard gate a lock. Both were locked at all times, with entry granted to visitors by ringing the bell at the gate. Oddly, the small delivery window in the kitchen's north wall was shuttered, barred, chained, and padocked.\n\nA ''[[charm of protection from theft]]'', a ''[[charm of protection from fire]]'', a ''[[charm of protection from disease]]'', and a ''[[charm of protection from spirits]]'' were all aaffixed to the main gate; these could be altered by the innkeeper to cancel their power. These warded the building against catching alight, hindering and slowing any flames that should spread; protected the occupants against catching or spreading an infection; prevented [[spirit]]s from entering the establishment; and hindered would-be thieves from sneaking about and picking locks.<ref>"
