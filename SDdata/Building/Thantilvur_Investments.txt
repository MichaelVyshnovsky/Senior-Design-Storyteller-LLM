'''Thantilvur Investments''' was a building in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Death Masks|?-?|?}}

==Structure==
The building was fitted with a false wall (which the [[wizard]] [[Glenmaur]] hid behind) and a collapsing ceiling, which was used to trap [[Laeral Silverhand]].

==History==
Thantilvur Investments was commissioned to be built in the {{YearlinkName|1491}} by [[Braethan Cazondur]], a [[Lords of Waterdeep|Lord of Waterdeep]] who kept his connection to the building a secret. He murdered the crew of builders who had installed the collapsing ceiling with poisoned [[elverquisst]] and had [[Shrikegulk]] dispose of their bodies. He would later use it as the site of an ambush against Laeral Silverhand and was able to crush the Open Lord under the collapsing ceiling, however Laeral would later return in the body of [[Elminster]]. The building was completely destroyed in the magical battle that ensued, which involved [[Vajra Safahr]], [[Qasmult]], Glenmaur, and the returned Laeral.
