Trollskull Manor was one of the largest buildings of Trollskull Alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
The building was located at the corner of Saerdoun Street and the north entrance of Trollskull Alley.
The manor was four stories tall with a basement. It had numerous balconies, five chimneys, and a turret.
The ground floor consisted of a large taproom, a kitchen, and a pantry from where the basement could be accessed. The upper floors contained numerous bedrooms, bathrooms, and studies.
The historic building was originally a tavern kept by the half-elf Lif.
Following Lifs death, Trollskull Manor fell into abandon. It was bought by Volothamp Geddarm sometime in the early 1490s DR. Volo intended to investigate the manor as part of research for his book Volos Guide to Spirits and Specters.
By the , the abandoned building was haunted by Lifs poltergeist. Lif could not abandon his former lifes work of maintaining the tavern and his spirit could only be appeased if the place was restored to its former functions.
