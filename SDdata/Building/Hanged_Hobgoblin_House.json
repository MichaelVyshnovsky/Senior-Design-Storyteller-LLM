        "mainbody": "he Hanged Hobgoblin House or the Obgoblin was the only tavern in the hamlet of White Ford in Archendale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe Hanged Hobgoblin House was more of a large, run-down barn in its final stages of disrepair.\nThe taverns ground floor had a taproom.\nSeveral impressive antler arrangements adorned the taproom on the taverns ground floor, surrounding the mounted head of a hobgoblin with wide-open eyes. The head was known by the name \"Urbert\"\nThe Hanged Hobgoblin House served as a decent but unremarkable lodging option for White Ford offering all the conveniences typical of a village tavern, but its survival in a bigger community could have been questionable, possibly leading to closure.\nAt the Hanged Hobgoblin House, patrons could rely on friendly and eager-to-help staff members."
