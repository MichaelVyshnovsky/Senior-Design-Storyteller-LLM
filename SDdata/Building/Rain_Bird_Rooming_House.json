        "Interior": "One of the doors in the kitchens had a peeling figure of a wizard, painted blue. This door was actually a ''[[portal]]'' of sorts.",
        "History": "In the early spring of {{yearlink|1373}}, [[Elminster Aumar]] walked out of the portal with the peeling blue paint, and conversed briefly with his old friend, [[Phaerorn]], telling him the news about his son in [[Suzail]]. Phaerorn then explained to his scullery boy, [[Naviskurr]], that the man was actually Elminster and that was why nothing should block that door; Naviskurr fainted after Elminster left."
