        "mainbody": "The Resting Place of the Whip was the temple of Loviatar in Melvaunt in the 1370s DR.\nThe temple had seventeen priests, led by High Whipmistress Suzildara Sharranen. The temple was not particularly popular as worship of Loviatar had decreased significantly by 1373 DR. The church remained thanks in no small part to the alliance they formed with a local cult dedicated to Iyachtu Xvim."
