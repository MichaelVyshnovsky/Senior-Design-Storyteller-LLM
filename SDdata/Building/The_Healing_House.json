        "mainbody": "'''The Healing House''' was a home and place of healing in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and managed by [[Chanczlatha Luruin]] and his family.<ref group=\"note\">The unnamed \"pharmacist who specializes in sick pack animals\" in ''The Savage Frontier'' p. 28 is presumed to be Chanczlatha Luruin.",
        "Location": "It stood in the lower part of Bargewright Inn, in the northeast amongst the paddocks.<ref><ref>",
        "Services": "As well as serving as the Luruin family home for Chanczlatha, his wife [[Baerlatha Luruin|Baerlatha]], and their many adopted children, the Healing House was also his office and place of work. he was both physic and animal healer, treating people and beasts alike with [[herb]]s and healthy broths more than his [[magic]], and fairly successfully. His patients regularly included folk who'd run into perils on the way to Bargewright Inn and were taken to his house, and he would never leave the settlement. He also had a specialty in pack animals, given the livestock, travelers, and traders that passed through.\n\nChanczlatha usually charged 5 [[gp]] for a visit and 6 [[gp]] to provide care over a full day and night. He also charged for his divine spellcasting, but the followers of Lathander were treated free of charge. The profits went back into purchasing medicines and animal feed; the Luruins were usually lacking for coin.\n\nOne of the nearby paddocks belonged to the Luruins and here they cared for large unwell beasts. Here, travelers could sell aged, weary, or unwell mounts to the Luruins for 5 [[sp]], or if needed purchase a recovering mount for 8 sp; the price was negotiated for especially small or poorly specimens. They would care for and keep alive sick and injured animals that others might abandon or euthanize.\n\nChanczlatha was aided by his family in his efforts."
