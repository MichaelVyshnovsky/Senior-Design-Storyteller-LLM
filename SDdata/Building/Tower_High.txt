The Tower High was the home of Manshoon of the Zhentarim in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The Tower was located in Zhentil Keeps Inner Quarter in the northeast corner on the Lords Way and the Dark Road.
The Tower High was one of four towers in Manshoons walled compound, and easily the largest. The Tower High stood eight storys tall and included some subterranean sections as well.
Manshoon held select meetings within the Tower High for both the Council of Lords and the inner circle of the Zhentarim within a secret chamber.
Living gargoyles clung to the rafters of the Towers main hall. Six stone golems were situated in various locations within the Tower. Powerful guards and wards spells protected every room of the Tower High.
Orlgaun, Manshoons personal black dragon, lived within a lair beneath the Tower High. Large stone doors in the courtyard of the compound could be opened to release Orlgaun when needed. Manshoon also stored several of his stasis clones in a special laboratory found beneath the Tower.
