The '''Tower High''' was the home of [[Manshoon]] of the [[Zhentarim]] in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] before that city's destruction.

==Location==
The Tower was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] in the northeast corner on [[the Lord's Way]] and [[the Dark Road]].

==Description==
The Tower High was one of four towers in Manshoon's walled compound, and easily the largest. The Tower High stood eight storys tall and included some subterranean sections as well.

==Interior==
Manshoon held select meetings within the Tower High for both the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]] and the inner circle of the Zhentarim within a secret chamber.

==Defenses==
Living [[gargoyle]]s clung to the rafters of the Tower's main hall. Six [[stone golem]]s were situated in various locations within the Tower. Powerful ''[[guards and wards]]'' [[spell]]s protected every room of the Tower High.

==Inhabitants==
[[Orlgaun]], Manshoon's personal [[black dragon]], lived within a lair beneath the Tower High. Large stone doors in the courtyard of the compound could be opened to release Orlgaun when needed. Manshoon also stored several of his ''[[stasis clone]]s'' in a special laboratory found beneath the Tower.
