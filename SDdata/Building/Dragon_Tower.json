        "Location": "The tower was located on the west side of the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]].",
        "Description": "The Dragon Tower was so-named because the top of the tower was shaped to resemble a rampant dragon, complete with smoke coming out of its nostrils and mouth from the chimneys within. One of its owners, [[Maaril]] the Dragon Mage, was also known to ride a dragon out of the mouth of the Dragon Tower.\n\nRumors, confirmed by [[Elminster]], said that the tower contained many enchanted guardians trapped by Maaril. The lower levels were also said to contain magical pools that could confer magical powers or dissolve flesh and bone instantly. It was also rumored that some of Maaril's former female apprentices had been drained of life by magic and turned into [[wraith]]s to roam the tower's interior.",
        "History": "The Dragon Tower was once owned by the [[wizard]] [[Lhoril]]. There she taught several apprentices until one turned on her and summoned a [[demon]] to murder her in an alley.\n\nMaaril the Dragon Mage took over the tower from Lhoril sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
