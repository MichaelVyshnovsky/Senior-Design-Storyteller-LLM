The Temple of Malar was a small structure in the Thayan city of Bezantur dedicated to the worship of Malar.
The temple was located near the waterfront in southern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the Temple of Talona, the Temple of Auril, and the Temple of Lliira. It was also quite close to the Temple of Umberlee.
The temple hosted services dedicated to its bestial god, and preached that the elves of Faer√ªn ought to be exterminated. These services were largely attended by non-Thayans, notably outlander barbarians and freed slaves.
The temple was home to a number of priests and followers of Malar. In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the congregation was led by High Priest Nul.
