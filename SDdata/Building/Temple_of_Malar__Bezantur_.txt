The '''Temple of Malar''' was a small structure in the [[Thayan]] city of [[Bezantur]] dedicated to the worship of [[Malar]].

==Location==
The temple was located near the waterfront in southern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Talona (Bezantur)|Temple of Talona]], the [[Temple of Auril (Bezantur)|Temple of Auril]], and the [[Temple of Lliira (Bezantur)|Temple of Lliira]]. It was also quite close to the [[Temple of Umberlee (Bezantur)|Temple of Umberlee]].

==Activities==
The temple hosted services dedicated to its bestial god, and preached that the [[elves]] of [[Faer√ªn]] ought to be exterminated. These services were largely attended by non-Thayans, notably outlander [[barbarian]]s and freed [[slave]]s.

==Inhabitants==
The temple was home to a number of [[priest]]s and followers of Malar. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the congregation was led by High Priest [[Nul]].
