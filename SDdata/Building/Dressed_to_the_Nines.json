They maintained a high exclusivity and the stores owner, the haughty Jordan Whipt, preferred to cater to the nobility of the city.\nThe store specialized in the sale of custom-ordered uniforms. Many adventurers and rogues would use the stores services as a source of disguises, much to Jordans irritation.\nThe store featured a signboard that displayed a Ravenian soldier standing at full attention. The Nines doorman wore matching attire."
