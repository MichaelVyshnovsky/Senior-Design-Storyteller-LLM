The '''Harem Palace of Calim''' in the city of [[Teshyll]] was a massive palace of the [[djinn]]i [[Calim]] said to have housed nearly 2,000 [[human]] and [[jann]] slaves and concubines at the height of the [[Calim Empire]]. It was known for its extraordinary architecture.<ref name=EotSS-p79>

After Teshyll's destruction in the [[First Era of Skyfire]], the [[Alzhedo dictionary#J|''Jhasinnadah'']] became home to an assortment of bandits and monsters over the centuries. By [[1370 DR]], only the slightest evidence of its existence remained amongst the ruins.<ref name=EotSS-p79/>
