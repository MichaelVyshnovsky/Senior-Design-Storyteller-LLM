The Harem Palace of Calim in the city of Teshyll was a massive palace of the djinni Calim said to have housed nearly 2,000 human and jann slaves and concubines at the height of the Calim Empire. It was known for its extraordinary architecture.
After Teshylls destruction in the First Era of Skyfire, the Jhasinnadah became home to an assortment of bandits and monsters over the centuries. By 1370 DR, only the slightest evidence of its existence remained amongst the ruins.
