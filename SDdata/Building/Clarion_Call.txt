The '''Clarion Call''' was a temple dedicated to [[Persana]] in the [[aquatic elf]] city of [[Myth Nantar]].

==Location==
This temple stood in the [[Myth Nantar/Law Quarter|Law Quarter]] of Myth Nantar. Like all temples in Myth Nantar, there was a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} perimeter around the building that was free of [[coral]]. The coral that grew around this boundary, which was clearly defined as if moving around a force field, was always as smooth as [[silk]].<ref>

==Structure==
The Clarion Call was a temple made of blue [[marble]], supported by pillars of carved bubbles, that stood two stories tall. On its front face was a massive frieze that depicted a [[triton]] astride a [[giant sea horse]] and blowing a horn.

===Interiors===
Inside of this temple were said to be feats of engineering that rivaled those of the pyramids of the [[Raurin desert]].

==History==
Though there were few tritons in Myth Nantar, even in the city's heyday, there were many [[Dukar]]s who worshiped at the Clarion Call as they felt the [[deity]]'s philosophies of building and guardianship were in tune with their own.
