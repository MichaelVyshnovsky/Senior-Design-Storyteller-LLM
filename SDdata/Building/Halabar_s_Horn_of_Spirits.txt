'''Halabar's Horn of Spirits''' was a particularly filthy bar, found on [[Lanthalar street]] in the city of [[Sundabar]], during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Just about everything within the establishment, especially the furniture, had been broken. 

The patrons of ''Halabar's Horn'' were a particularly deplorable lot. They would often pour out of the front doors, and fight and drink in the city streets.
