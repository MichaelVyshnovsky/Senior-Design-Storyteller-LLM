The Room of the Fire Wyrm was a room in Castle Obarskyr of Suzail.
The Room of the Fire Wyrm was about two stories above where the ghost of the Princess and Regent Alusair Obarskyr kept a cache of healing draughts. It was at the far end of one of the palace wings.
The room was seldom used it had a number of soft, stuffed beds of matched hues and many crimson draperies. There was a portrait of King Duar, almost certainly Duar Obarskyr, with cut-out eyes that allowed vigilance of the room from within a hidden passage.
The passage contained a trap at some point, which had since claimed a War Wizard.
Forty years prior to , the room had been popular for trysts amongst courtiers at that point the War Wizards took exclusive possession of the key.
Before the Council of the Dragon in 1479 DR, the ghost of Regent Alusair Obarskyr and the fugitive wizard Elminster Aumar used a passage around the room while sneaking through Castle Obarskyr, and briefly spied inside. There, they saw the War Wizard Raereene and the palace server Kreane in the midst of a tryst. The escapees stopped to look only briefly.
