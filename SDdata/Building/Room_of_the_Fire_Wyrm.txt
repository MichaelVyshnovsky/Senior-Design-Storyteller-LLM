The '''Room of the Fire Wyrm''' was a room in [[Castle Obarskyr]] of [[Suzail]].

==Location==
The Room of the Fire Wyrm was about two stories above where the [[ghost]] of the Princess and Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]] kept a cache of [[potion of healing|healing draughts]]. It was at the far end of one of the palace wings.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The room was seldom used; it had a number of soft, stuffed beds of matched hues and many crimson draperies. There was a portrait of King Duar, almost certainly [[Duar Obarskyr]], with cut-out eyes that allowed vigilance of the room from within a hidden passage.

==Defenses==
The passage contained a trap at some point, which had since claimed a [[War Wizard]].

==History==
Forty years prior to {{yearlink|1479}}, the room had been popular for trysts amongst courtiers; at that point the War Wizards took exclusive possession of the key.

Before the [[Council of the Dragon]] in 1479 DR, the [[ghost]] of Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]] and the fugitive [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]] used a passage around the room while sneaking through [[Castle Obarskyr]], and briefly spied inside. There, they saw the War Wizard [[Raereene]] and the palace server [[Kreane]] in the midst of a tryst. The escapees stopped to look only briefly.
