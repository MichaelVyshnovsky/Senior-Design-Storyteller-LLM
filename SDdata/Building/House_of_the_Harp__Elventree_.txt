}}The '''House of the Harp''' was a fieldstone hut that served as a [[Harpers|Harper]] base in [[Elventree]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Description==
The small hut was found in a tangled ravine. Moss and flowers covered the roof and a carved stone harp stood beside the building.

The hut actually masked a large dry cave within that stretched away with various passages and storerooms. The passages connected to other caves beneath Elventree, creating a vast network of underground tunnels.

==Inhabitants==
A [[ghost]] named [[Shalaer]] watched over the House of the Harp.

==Defenses==
Shalaer could summon the Harpers inhabiting Elventree within minutes if needed. She installed several magic wands in the chambers and corridors of the hut that she could activate at any time.
