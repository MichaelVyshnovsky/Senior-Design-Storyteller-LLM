        "mainbody": "hadrun of the Snows was a monastery and shrine located at a hot spring near the borders of Erlkazar.\nThe monastery was founded by a holy man named Vashtun who built a small shrine. People would come to visit and leave offerings. Some visitors remained to meditate, which was how the monastery was formed.\nWhen Vashtun died, another monk took his name and assumed leadership of the monastery. By tradition, at the passing of each Vashtun, another monk assumed the title. The second-in-command of the monastery was known as Diamar.\nPeople who meditated at Shadrun of the Snows often heard a strange voice at the backs of their minds. This was actually an imprisoned entity named Fandour who was attempting to make contact with the Prime Material Plane. The interior of the monastery was decorated with paintings and carvings of strange geometric symbols that Fandour subconsciously influenced the monks to create.\nShadrun was protected by two devas, Lakini and Lusk."
