        "mainbody": "'''Shadrun of the Snows''' was a [[monastery]] and shrine located at a hot spring near the borders of [[Erlkazar]].",
        "History": "The monastery was founded by a holy man named [[Vashtun]] who built a small shrine. People would come to visit and leave offerings. Some visitors remained to meditate, which was how the monastery was formed.",
        "Leadership": "When Vashtun died, another monk took his name and assumed leadership of the monastery. By tradition, at the passing of each Vashtun, another monk assumed the title. The second-in-command of the monastery was known as [[Diamar]].",
        "Legends": "People who meditated at Shadrun of the Snows often heard a strange voice at the backs of their minds. This was actually an imprisoned entity named [[Fandour]] who was attempting to make contact with the [[Prime Material Plane]]. The interior of the monastery was decorated with paintings and carvings of strange geometric symbols that Fandour subconsciously influenced the monks to create.",
        "Inhabitants": "Shadrun was protected by two [[Deva (aasimar)|devas]], [[Lakini]] and [[Lusk]]."
