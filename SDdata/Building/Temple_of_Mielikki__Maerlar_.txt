The '''temple of Mielikki''' in the city of [[Maerlar]] in [[Mulhorand]] was once visited by the [[Mielikki|Supreme Ranger]] herself.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1246}}, the dying [[ranger]] [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]] arrived at the Maerlar temple bearing the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''. He fell into the priests' arms, holding the ''Companion'' out to them though he could not tell them what it was. The priests charged out to heal him and protect him from the [[doppelganger]]s pursuing him, when a mystery lady in green emerged from the trees and caused vines to ensnare, choke, and tear apart the doppelgangers with no more than her finger. She picked up the faithful Rhighaermon O'Antlers with a smile and disappeared, as the stunned priests fell to their knees and wept and praised Mielikki. A message on their altar would be found the next morning, as if it had always been there, encouraging the Mielikkians to continue the 'Rightful Cycle' of the tome.

The temple, and its inscription, remained as of [[1368 DR]].

==Description==
The altar was deeply carved with a message from Mielikki, reading "That which I first gave to [[Yornar]], I give to all in need, my priests to use, and my rangers to carry. Let it pass from you when the time is right, and to the right mortal. You will know when. Keep it not, lest the rightful cycle be broken."
