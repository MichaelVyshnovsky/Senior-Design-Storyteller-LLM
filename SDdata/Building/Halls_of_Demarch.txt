The '''Halls of Demarch''' was a [[guildhall]] in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It served as headquarters to [[Demarch's Alliance]] and later [[Demarch's Folly]].

==Location==
The Halls of Demarch was a secret guildhall, hidden beneath the city of Tantras. It consisted of a subterranean complex and a network of tunnels.

==Defenses==
The tunnels of the Halls of Demarch were permanently filled with fog and haunted by [[shadow]]s, other kinds of [[undead]], and other monsters. These were a byproduct of the [[Battle of Demarch's Fall]].

==History==
The Halls of Demarch were once home to [[Demarch's Alliance]] between [[beguiler]]s who served [[Leira]] and those who served [[Mask]].

But after Mask betrayed Leira in [[1358 DR|the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the alliance was broken and the two factions fought a massive battle in their former headquarters, the [[Battle of Demarch's Fall]]. The rival beguilers fought a number of bloody skirmishes through the tunnels, all concealed in mists. An enormous amount of magic was cast, resulting in the opening of a rift to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. Shadows and various other monsters fell out of the rift, along with several [[magic item]]s and the ''[[tome of Suelivain]]''. The Maskarran and Leiran beguilers slaughtered each other.

The survivors fled across [[Faerûn]], living in fear of revenge attacks and church agents seeking to learn or maintain their secrets. A few friendly ex-members, however, returned to the Halls of Demarch, believing the safest place to hide was the last place they were expected. They reformed into a new organization, taking the name [[Demarch's Folly]], and learned [[shadow magic]] from the ''book of Suelivain''.

==Inhabitants==
The Halls of Demarch were the headquarters of both Demarch's Alliance and Demarch's Folly.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Beguilers and Dragon Shamans|}}{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters|}}
