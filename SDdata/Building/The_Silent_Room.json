Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, January, 2012.\nThe temple was primarily concerned with fighting the schism with the Orthodox Church of Oghma.\nIn 1357 DR Alias of Westgate visited the Silent Room hoping to get help with the mysterious azure magical tattoo she woke up with one day. Unfortunately, the temple was closed until the dawn service.\nThe temple was originally dedicated to Oghmas servant god Deneir, but he disappeared during the Spellplague and the temple became a place of worship of Oghma. A few years prior to 1479 DR, the Oghmanyte Church in Sembia relocated to the Silent Room."
