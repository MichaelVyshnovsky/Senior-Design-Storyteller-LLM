In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple was run by High Namer [[Wyndel Sedranis]], a member of the [[Emmarask]] noble house. The temple housed a half-dozen [[priest]]s and about one hundred laymen. It was known for its library of books on the [[Dragon Reach]][[Eric Menge]]\"Backdrop:  Suzail\" ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]] '' #198. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, January, 2012.\n\nThe temple was primarily concerned with fighting the schism with the [[Orthodox Church of Oghma]].",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR]] [[Alias]] of [[Westgate]] visited the Silent Room hoping to get help with the mysterious azure magical tattoo she woke up with one day. Unfortunately, the temple was closed until the dawn service.\n\nThe temple was originally dedicated to Oghma's servant god [[Deneir]], but he disappeared during the [[Spellplague]] and the temple became a place of worship of Oghma. A few years prior to [[1479 DR]], the Oghmanyte Church in [[Sembia]] relocated to the Silent Room."
