        "mainbody": "The '''Garden of the Drow''' was an ancient [[drow]] monastic retreat hidden in [[Undermountain]]. The complex was famous for its exquisitely delicate [[crystal rose]]s.",
        "Location": "Garden of the Drow was a spacious structure located somewhere in the deeper areas of the [[Dungeon Level]]. The building's architecture stood out and looked out of place in Undermountain. The retreat strongly resembled dwarven design, likely indicating it's origins with the [[Clan Melairkyn]], later taken over by the [[drow]]. The Garden's entrance was hidden behind a ''[[gate]]'', guaranteeing seclusion and privacy to its occupants. The main entrance to the complex was accentuated by a large decorative planter seeded with various [[mushroom]]s that could cause nausea and dizziness if consumed.",
        "Interior": "Even past its prime, the retreat's interior showed aged luxury and a well-planned layout; past the main entrance, the building sprawled into numerous halls and rooms. The main banquet hall was decorated with old but well-made furniture. Behind the banquet hall, numerous private sitting areas could be found. The complex had smaller private mushroom gardens and sleeping quarters in both wings of the building.\n\nThe central chamber of the Garden of the Drow held a small secluded beautiful, and serene chamber. The titular Garden had beautiful waterfalls, pools of clean water with adjacent park benches, lush vegetation, various cave fungi overtaken the area in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. However, some of the unique plantlike remained, including the famous crystal roses. The Garden emanated quiet and relaxation even when the area was infested with monsters or taken over by the [[drow]].",
        "History": "The Garden of the Drow was likely part of [[Melairbode]] and with the final dwarf survivors of the Clan Melairkyn abandoning the settlement, was taken by the drow who transformed it into a secluded, serene monastic retreat for their kind. Following [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s arrival to Undermountain, the drow abandoned the complex to the dungeon's dangers and monsters.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], the Garden was relatively spared by the ravages of time and subterranean critters. When Matron [[Azurna]] brought her evil alliance to Undermountain, the Gardens became one of the strongholds of the drow on the Dungeon Level. Azurna knew that centuries ago, Halaster hid one of the ''spider statue'' fragments inside the complex, and the drow were attempting to recover the item. During that time, a love-stricken young noble from [[Waterdeep]] descended into Undermountain, searching for one of the crystal roses that grew inside. [[Asborn Moonstar]] was able to sneak past the drow into the central garden chamber, and that's where he was trapped. The cruel drow watched the youth starve to death inside the beautiful and serene Garden.\n\nSoon after the young Moonstar's death, one of [[Khelben Arunsun]]'s agents discovered his corpse and pushed drow elves out of the stronghold. He left Asborn's body in the Garden and retrieved a crystal rose for his grieving fianc√©, and found the hidden ''spider piece''. The Garden of the Drow was without occupants once more.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, apart from the [[drow]] who briefly occupied the retreat, many rooms were infested with giant [[beetle]]s, giant and mundane [[rat]]s, and other minor pests."
