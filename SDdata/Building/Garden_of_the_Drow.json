        "mainbody": "The Garden of the Drow was an ancient drow monastic retreat hidden in Undermountain. The complex was famous for its exquisitely delicate crystal roses.\nGarden of the Drow was a spacious structure located somewhere in the deeper areas of the Dungeon Level. The buildings architecture stood out and looked out of place in Undermountain. The retreat strongly resembled dwarven design, likely indicating its origins with the Clan Melairkyn, later taken over by the drow. The Gardens entrance was hidden behind a gate, guaranteeing seclusion and privacy to its occupants. The main entrance to the complex was accentuated by a large decorative planter seeded with various mushrooms that could cause nausea and dizziness if consumed.\nEven past its prime, the retreats interior showed aged luxury and a well-planned layout past the main entrance, the building sprawled into numerous halls and rooms. The main banquet hall was decorated with old but well-made furniture. Behind the banquet hall, numerous private sitting areas could be found. The complex had smaller private mushroom gardens and sleeping quarters in both wings of the building.\nThe central chamber of the Garden of the Drow held a small secluded beautiful, and serene chamber. The titular Garden had beautiful waterfalls, pools of clean water with adjacent park benches, lush vegetation, various cave fungi overtaken the area in the 14 century DR. However, some of the unique plantlike remained, including the famous crystal roses. The Garden emanated quiet and relaxation even when the area was infested with monsters or taken over by the drow.\nThe Garden of the Drow was likely part of Melairbode and with the final dwarf survivors of the Clan Melairkyn abandoning the settlement, was taken by the drow who transformed it into a secluded, serene monastic retreat for their kind. Following Halaster Blackcloaks arrival to Undermountain, the drow abandoned the complex to the dungeons dangers and monsters.\nBy 1370 DR, the Garden was relatively spared by the ravages of time and subterranean critters. When Matron Azurna brought her evil alliance to Undermountain, the Gardens became one of the strongholds of the drow on the Dungeon Level. Azurna knew that centuries ago, Halaster hid one of the spider statue fragments inside the complex, and the drow were attempting to recover the item. During that time, a love-stricken young noble from Waterdeep descended into Undermountain, searching for one of the crystal roses that grew inside. Asborn Moonstar was able to sneak past the drow into the central garden chamber, and thats where he was trapped. The cruel drow watched the youth starve to death inside the beautiful and serene Garden.\nSoon after the young Moonstars death, one of Khelben Arunsuns agents discovered his corpse and pushed drow elves out of the stronghold. He left Asborns body in the Garden and retrieved a crystal rose for his grieving fianc√©, and found the hidden spider piece. The Garden of the Drow was without occupants once more.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, apart from the drow who briefly occupied the retreat, many rooms were infested with giant beetles, giant and mundane rats, and other minor pests."
