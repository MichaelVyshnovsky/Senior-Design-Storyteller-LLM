The Golden Harp Inn was an inn located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The inn was located in the far northeast corner of Waterdeeps Sea Ward on Skulls Street just west of the High Road.
The Golden Harp inn stood two stories tall and was built from stone and slate. The interior was cheery and well-lit. A magical harp sometimes floated about the inn playing music for patrons.
