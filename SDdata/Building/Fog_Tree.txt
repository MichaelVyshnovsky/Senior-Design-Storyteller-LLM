Fog Tree was a magical cluster of tangled trees that were affected by the wild magics of the Weeping War and Myth Drannors mythal making them into a deadly spot in the middle of the ruined city.
The Fog Tree stood at the western end of Serpentspires adjacent to the Dragoneyes Street in the Cormanthor ward of Myth Drannor. It also stood in between Serpentspires and Jerroks Concert Hall to the north.
The name Fog Tree was given to a small and thick cluster of trees that were all entwined together, roots, branches, and trunks, into what appeared to be one body. The ground around the Fog Tree was ridden with the trees roots and was hard to traverse through.
The most notable thing about the Fog Tree was that it constantly emitted differently-colored fogs that varied from harmless to deadly. The type and color of the fog created changed hourly. The fog colors were white, light gray, dark grey, light green, light yellow, and different shades of brown, and the effects of the fogs could be ay one of the following spells fog cloud, solid fog, acid fog, mind fog, cloudkill, stingking cloud. There was no color and effect correlation as both were seemingly determined at random. The colors of rose, purple, and blue were extremely rare and could indicate one of the rare effects the fog could cast upon anyone inside its cloud, such as emotion hate, cure, critical wounds, and fly. When the fogs color changed, the effect could follow within a minute or so after.
The Fog Tree cluster was known to be a haven for dangerous monsters who were unaffected by the harmful magical fogs created by the trees.
There were legends of a treasure under the Fog Trees roots that belonged to some long-dead fallen heroes.
Adventurers who came across the Fog Tree on occasion tried destroying the trees to seemingly no avail. This led to the theories that the trees are either invulnerable or were able to cast healing magic upon themselves.
