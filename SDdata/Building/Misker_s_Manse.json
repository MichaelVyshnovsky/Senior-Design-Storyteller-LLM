        "mainbody": "Miskers Manse was a private residence in the Lower Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nMiskers Manse was a three-story mansion in good condition. The mansion itself was crafted from purple and green stone, designed to appear as though it grew naturally rather than through construction.\nThe interior of the mansion was reportedly filled with rare and strange art that reflected the Miskers alien aesthetics, and its floors were notably devoid of ramps or stairways, rendering much of it inaccessible to those unable to levitate or fly."
