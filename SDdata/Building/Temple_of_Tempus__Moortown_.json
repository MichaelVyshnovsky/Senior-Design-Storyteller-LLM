It was just north of the Swamphouse Inn.\nThe temple was made of stone and contained a stone statue of Tempus. It also had a basement accessible via a trapdoor. \nBy the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the ruined temple was strewn with rubble, bone, and bits of fur, and the statue had lost its head.\nThe temples clerics had maintained a large cache of healing items in the basement, including potions of healing, scrolls of cure critical wounds and cure disease, jars of Keoghtoms ointment, and a rod of resurrection. Much of this was left behind when the temple was abandoned.\nthumb|400px|The tree red dragon wyrmlings play with the head of the statue of Tempus.When the Cult of the Dragon established an outpost in Moortown in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it became a base for a number of the Cults dragon allies. Early in the , three red dragons were hatched in the town&mdashoffspring of the Cults allies, Wyndfire and Snizzler&mdashand the temple was turned into a nursery for them. When their parents were away, these wyrmlings were looked after by another red dragon&mdashFlameshoot&mdashand by a human guard named Mristin, whom the hatchlings had been instructed to obey. \nThe wyrmlings spent much of days quarreling loudly and playing with the head of the temples Tempus statue. They would wander out of the building to investigate if they smelled an intruder. Much of the Cult of the Dragon prescience in Moortown was oriented toward protecting them, and the Cultists had taken precautions to clear the temple of anything that could threaten them."
