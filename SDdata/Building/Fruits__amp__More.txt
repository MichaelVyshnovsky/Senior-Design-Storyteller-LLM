'''Fruits & More''' was a grocery shop located in [[the Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Fruits & More stood on the very end of the northern side of [[Karen Court]] in the Shutters.

==Services==
Fruits & More specialized on selling [[sugar]]s, [[jams]], and [[compote]]s, making it the closest thing to a grocer in the Shutters. The locals as well as farmers from nearby sold fruits and preserves of their own making at the shop. The items on offer included [[cordial]]s made right there at Fruits & More by soaking berries in cheap alcohol for months at a time. The cordials' taste was far from reliable, varying from terrible to delicious.
