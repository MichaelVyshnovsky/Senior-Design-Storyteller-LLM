        "mainbody": "The '''Cenotaph of Maanzecorian''' was a small shrine dedicated to the [[mind flayer]] [[deity]] [[Maanzecorian]], who embodied complete knowledge and comprehension. The Cenotaph was located on the western edge of the [[Undervaults of Ilsensine]] in the [[illithid]] city of [[Oryndoll]]. The Cenotaph was home to the Cult of the Philosoflayer, who were a minor part of the [[Venerator Creed]].",
        "Description": "The shrine was constructed of jet, jade, ivory, and marble and the hides of many creatures were put on display. The chambers of the shrine were richly furnished, and the shrine itself was dome-like in shape. At the zenith of each dome, Maanzecorian's holy symbol was inscribed&mdash;a silver crown set with a red gem.",
        "History": "The Cult of the Philosoflayer was active until Maanzecorian was killed by [[Tenebrous]], the undead remnant of the [[demon lord]] [[Orcus]]. The Elder Concord of Oryndoll did its best to save what they could from Maanzecorian's realm of [[Gehenna]], but in the end the Cenotaph was left to fall into ruin.\n\nMaanzecorian returned during the [[Second Sundering]] in the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]] and resumed its prior position across many temples in the realms, though it is unknown if this temple was also refurbished."
