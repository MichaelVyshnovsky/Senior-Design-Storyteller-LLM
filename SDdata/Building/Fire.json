Despite elements generally playing a neutral role in the cosmos, fire was seen as aggressive and evil by many.\nFire manifested its position in the cosmos as the Elemental Plane of Fire, one of the Inner Planes. The element was also represented there in living form as fire elementals.\nThe ruler over the portfolio of fire in Faer√ªn and Zakhara was the elemental lord Kossuth, Beyond Realmspace, Sirrion the Flowing Flame held the portfolio of fire for the world of Krynn.\nMany magical spells utilized the element of fire. Elemental fire was recognized as a \"school of effect\" (rather than one of the eight traditional schools of magic). Wizards specializing in this school were called fire elementalists.In some areas of the world of Mystara, fire elementalists were called pyromancers. Fire was opposed to the element of water, both as a school of magic and as a worldview.\nMagic-users in Zakhara had a similar but not identical notion of fire magic in the form of the province of flame.\nLikewise, the wu jen of Kara-Tur divided spells into five elemental groups, including fire.\nA number of deities granted divine spells that relied on the element, either in the form of the elemental fire sphere, or the fire domain.\nSpacefarers also used the four elements to distinguish different types of celestial bodies present in the crystal spheres. Fire bodies were often found at the center of a crystal sphere, giving light and warmth to all its worlds. The sun of Realmspace (as its only fire body) was just such an example.|74-76"
