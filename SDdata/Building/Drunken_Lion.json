        "mainbody": "The Drunken Lion was an alehouse located in the city of Archenbridge during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was a dangerous place that served cheap drinks and cheaper food.\nThis tavern was located on the intersection between Fairwind Street and the road coming from the Arkhen Bridge.\nThe place was sparsely and rudely furnished, with tables resilient enough to endure the regular brawls that plagued the place, and to support the weight of hired dancers.\nThe cheap drinks and bad food attracted an unfriendly crowd of loggers, shepherds, trappers, Ridesmen and poor travelers. The place was always crowded and smoky, and the dancers rather unattractive.\nThe Drunken Lion was a dangerous place customers who started fights deliberately were served drinks laced with sleeping potions, and were found the next day in the River Arkhen freed from their valuables. In addition some dancers were known to use bolas to catch thieves or patrons that tried to leave without paying.\nCustomers at the Lion could get served a varied selection of drinks such as ales, cheap wines, and zzar. One could also get some nibbles there, such as hard biscuits and wormy cheese handwheels. A draft was sold for 4 cp, and flagon of cheap wine for 2 sp.\nThe best-looking dancer amongst the staff, a half-elven woman named Jalandyl o Stars, was rumored to be one of the owners of the tavern&mdashbut the employees refused to confirm this."
