        "mainbody": "The Amphitheater of the First Thunder was a temple and combat arena dedicated to Hoar, the Doombringer.\nThe temple was located in the capital city of Mourktar in Threskel.\nThe Amphitheater was a large open arena. The section of the compound that served as the temple was located underground.\nGladitorial matches occurred within the Amphitheater between the accused and accusers. These contests were used instead of a traditional court system as a form of justice. Hoar was believed to intervene in each match to ensure fitting justice was always served.\nThe power and influence of the Amphitheater of the First Thunder diminished with the death of King Theris, who was a devout follower of Hoar, during the Time of Troubles."
