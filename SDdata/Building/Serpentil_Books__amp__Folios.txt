'''Serpentil Books & Folios''' was an expensive [[book]] shop located in [[Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|6}} It was reputedly the best source of [[map]]s, [[chart]]s and [[book]]s in all the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]].

==Location==
Serpentil Books & Folios was located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] on the eastern side of [[Book Street]] just south of [[Black Wagon Alley]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Volo 5303}}

==Structure==
The shop was located in an old sandstone building. The windows of this three-stories edifice were boarded over, with an old battered sign the only indication of the shop's existence.

The main door was richly carved and made of exotic dark wood. It was always closed: a small viewing panel on its upper part indicated whether the shop was open or not. At night, faintly glowing magical [[Glyph of warding|glyph]]s could be observed on both the door and windows, scaring most would-be [[:category:thieves|thieves]] away.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The walls of this incredibly dusty shop were paneled with wood. The space was crammed with bookshelves overflowing with books, scrolls and other documents. As the windows were boarded over, the only light was provided by [[glowing globe]]s obeying the owner's will. The only furniture beside the shelves were the owner's desk and a couple chairs for the customers.

==Services==
===14{{th}} century [[DR]]===
[[File:Jannaxil Serpentil.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Jannaxil Serpentil]] watching over his wares.'']]
The shop sold any sort of printed materials such as [[chapbook]]s, [[map]]s, nautical charts, and other [[book]]s. While magical tomes and maps from the [[Sword Coast]] were the owner's specialties, he could proudly locate any kind of books such as collections of folktales or ballads for the right finder's fee.

Books sold in this place were quite expensive, with any useful non-magical book ranging from 15 to 50 [[gp]] in price. Magical books could sell for thousands of gold pieces, depending of the rarity and usefulness of the [[spell]]s they contained. Due to the high cost of such wares, Jannaxil would sometimes accept to trade them against valuable [[:Category:Magic items|magic items]].

Jannaxil was willing to buy about any printed lore, accounting documents and letters. He also dealt in stolen goods if a prospective customer asked him in the right way.

===15{{th}} century [[DR]]===
The owner [[Dwitt Serpentil|Dwitt]] dealt in [[map]]s, [[ink]] and other writing supplies, including rare [[paper]]s such as the ones made from [[Sussur]] trees. A workshop in the back of the shop was used by the owner's son, [[Jym Serpentil|Jym]], to produce [[paper]].

==Defenses==
The shop was protected by almost a hundred magical glyphs designed against thievery. Every glyph could fire once a day and automatically refreshed after 24 hours.
* One third of those were glyphs of ''[[spell turning]]'', reflecting hostile magic towards their caster.
* One third were charged with the spell ''[[Caligarde's claw]]'', and would tear apart anyone trying to force or pick the lock of the main door, remove the boards from the windows, or damage the walls of the building.
* The last third contained enough ''[[magic missile]]s'' to blast away anyone trying to land on the roof or pass through walls.

In addition, a [[binding]] spell prevented anyone from leaving with wares they didn't pay for, and powerful magic prevented anything from igniting inside the shop.

==Rumors & Legends==
===Secret tunnels===
According to tavern talks, Jannaxil built hidden tunnels where he hid caches of powerful magic protected by [[monster]]s, including copies of every useful spells found in the books he sold over the years.
===Black magic===
Rumors said that Jannaxil's private apartments above the shop contained a large summoning chamber, which he used to conjure [[baatezu]] to work for him.
