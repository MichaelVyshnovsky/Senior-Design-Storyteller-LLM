        "mainbody": "Jonstyls Banner was a rooming house in Tilverton in 1367 DR run by the ex-adventurer Jonstyl.\nThe Banner was located in the Old Town of Tilverton on Gateguard Road, just down from Filanis Tower of Wits and Work and the Temple of Gond Wondermaker. It was formerly the Windlords Rest inn until Thungor Triblane moved to larger premises nearby.\nJonstyl catered specially for adventurers. She offered discrete lodgings and potions of healing to those that needed it, and provided mounts, disguises, and meals at a moments notice at any hour.\nAlong with the regular guests, the former proprietor Thungor paid for two shy gnomes to live at the Banner. Their job was to meet guests who arrived at the Banner, expecting to find the Windlords Rest, and guide them to the Windlords new location a few streets over."
