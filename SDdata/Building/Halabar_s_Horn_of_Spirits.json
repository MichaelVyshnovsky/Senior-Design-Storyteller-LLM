        "mainbody": "alabars Horn of Spirits was a particularly filthy bar, found on Lanthalar street in the city of Sundabar, during the mid-14 century DR. Just about everything within the establishment, especially the furniture, had been broken. \nThe patrons of Halabars Horn were a particularly deplorable lot. They would often pour out of the front doors, and fight and drink in the city streets."
