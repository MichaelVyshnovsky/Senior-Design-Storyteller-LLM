The Green Phoenix was a tavern located in the 3rd quarter of Innarlith.
It was housed in a sprawling brick-building.
The interior was dark and smoke-filled. A large room behind the bar filled with large copper kettles was used to brew ale.
The alchemist Surero went to work here in 1368 DR after he stopped working with Ivar Devorast at the canal site. He used the alias Orerus in order to avoid being recognized while he worked there. However, Phyrea, the daughter of Senator Inthelph, located him here when she was trying to find out what happened to Devorast after he was dismissed from his work at the canal.
