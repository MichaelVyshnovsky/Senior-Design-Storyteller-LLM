        "mainbody": "he Sablegarth House was a striking residence located in the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. It was one of the most noteworthy buildings on Falyern Way within the citys Tentowers neighborhood.\nLooking more like a palace rather than a familys home, Sablegarth did serve as the city residence for the noble Hawkdragon family, during the scant amount of time they spent in Ravens Bluff. It featured a facade of stunning black marble, that easily caught the eye."
