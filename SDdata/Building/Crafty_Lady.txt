The Crafty Lady was an inn and tavern in the city of Procampur in the Vast in the late 14 century DR. It stood by the docks.
It stood by the docks in the Port District and was easy to find, for no other place looked as bad. It was perhaps the most dilapidated tavern in the district. It was a block away from warehouse 5.
Inside, the décor was little more than junk, with crude chairs that squeaked and tables so unfinished theyd leave a careless diner with splinters.
Although poorly maintained and poorly operated, it was at least appropriately cheap and the drinks and food were of matching quality.
In Tarsakh in the , Damon Norvill frequented the Crafty Lady. He was found there by a band of adventurers hired by Lady Phoebe Piniago to investigate some suspicious addictive candy her husband Lord Aldo Piniago was consuming.
