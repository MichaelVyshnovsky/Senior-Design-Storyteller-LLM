The Shrine of the Bold was located in the great fortress of Sarahin.
The Shrine of the Bold was located deep within the Haunted Lands of Zakhara in Sarahin.
This shrine was dedicated to Hajamas brother Najm. It was erected for the hobgoblins, farisan, and few holy slayers who worshiped the god of adventure.
Since the shrine was empty much of the time, it became a popular location for evening trysts between the holy slayers.
