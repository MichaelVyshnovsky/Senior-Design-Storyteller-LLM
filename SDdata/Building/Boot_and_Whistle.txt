The Boot and Whistle was a tavern in Heliogabalus until the late 14 century DR.
Pavel Shemov used to visit the Boot and Whistle as an initiate of the Temple of the Dawn, spending as much time there as he did in the Temple itself. The Boot and Whistle had been closed as of 1373 DR, replaced by a boarding house. The room of Kosef Demsk was visible from the tavern.
