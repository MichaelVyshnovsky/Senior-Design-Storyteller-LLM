The '''Boot and Whistle''' was a tavern in [[Heliogabalus]] until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
[[Pavel Shemov]] used to visit the Boot and Whistle as an initiate of the [[Temple of the Dawn]], spending as much time there as he did in the Temple itself. The Boot and Whistle had been closed as of 1373 [[DR]], replaced by a boarding house.{{cite book/The Rite|253|11}} The room of [[Kosef Demsk]] was visible from the tavern. {{cite dragon/327/The Silverfish|39}}
