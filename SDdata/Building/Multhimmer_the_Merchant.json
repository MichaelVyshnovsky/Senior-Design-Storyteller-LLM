        "mainbody": "Multhimmer the Merchant was a general store located in Ashabenford in the 14 century DR. The owner of the shop, Multhimmer, preferred to deal in imported glassware, furniture and fine metal goods such as lamps, platters, wall hooks, adornments and ornamental pieces. The prices of the shop were set fairly high, about 20% higher than those found from streetside stalls in Sembia.  \nThere were occasionally stolen goods that were offered in Multhimmers shop but he never acquired pilfered goods as a fence."
