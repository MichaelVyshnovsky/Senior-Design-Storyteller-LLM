The Ducal Castle, also known as Daggerford Castle,
The castle was built atop a small hill in the eastern half of town. It was surrounded by the open area referred to as the Commons.
The stone keep was three stories tall and surrounded by a stone wall that was about two-thirds its height.
Between the keep and the castle walls was a small courtyard that held the dukes smithy, the stables, several gardens and their private grounds. The gate leading out to the rest of town remained open to its citizens at all times.
Set within the hill beneath the castle were dungeons that dated back to the Barony of Blood, and its ruler Artor Morlin.
Construction of the castle began in the , by the local folk hero Tyndal "Daggerford". It was originally built as a simple wooden fortress, but was eventually burnt to the ground by orcs. Duke Tyndal rebuilt his castle out of stone and hunted down the orcs responsible for its previous destruction. The residents of the castle began to build outside of its walls, and eventually the town of Daggerford was formed.
When the dwarves of Clan Ironeater moved to Daggerford in the 13 century DR, they offered their masonry skills to the town and its duke. They removed the last portions of the castle that were still made of wood, such as the guard towers atop its walls, and rebuilt them in stone.
