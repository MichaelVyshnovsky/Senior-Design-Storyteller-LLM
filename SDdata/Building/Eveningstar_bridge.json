Not long after, a company of orcs from the Storm Horns (ostensibly controlled by Archwizard Amskar of Thultanthar) suddenly raided Eveningstar as well, briefly overwhelming the eastern defenses of the bridge before the garrisoned Purple Dragons pushed them back and secured both ends. They then reinforced the eastern barricades while sending forces into the Storm Horns to determine the source of the attack."
