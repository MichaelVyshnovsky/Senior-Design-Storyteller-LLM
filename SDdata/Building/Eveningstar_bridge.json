Not long after, a company of [[orc]]s from the [[Storm Horns]] (ostensibly controlled by Archwizard [[Amskar]] of [[Thultanthar]]) suddenly raided Eveningstar as well, briefly overwhelming the eastern defenses of the bridge before the garrisoned [[Purple Dragons]] pushed them back and secured both ends. They then reinforced the eastern barricades while sending forces into the Storm Horns to determine the source of the attack."
