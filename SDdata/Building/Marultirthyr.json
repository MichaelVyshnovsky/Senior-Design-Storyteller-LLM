        "mainbody": "'''Marultirthyr''' was a temple dedicated to [[Deep Sashelas]] in the [[Myth Nantar/Elves' Quarter|Elves' Quarter]] of [[Myth Nantar]].",
        "Structure": "This temple was a five-story structure, with a three-story domed central altar. The structure was composed of translucent pearled glass walls and coral. On the interior underside of the dome was a fresco depicting Deep Sashelas as a handsome [[aquatic elf]], surrounded by a school of [[dolphin]]s. The temple as a whole was an example of the craftmanship of the late [[Aryselmalyr]] period.\n\nLike all temples of Deep Sashelas in [[Serôs]], Marultirthyr had a specially-marked nave containing a [[portal|gate]] linked to the other temples. Activating this gate required one to utter the name of the temple they wished to visit and then whirl in place five times.<ref>",
        "History": "By [[1370 DR]], Marultirthyr was among the few sites in the Elves' Quarter not to be compromised by the thick, overgrown sheathes of [[cryscoral]] that dominated much of the quarter.<ref>\n\nIn the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], this temple was in a state of disrepair due to recent attacks on the city by [[sahuagin]]. This included part of the structure's coral dome having collapsed atop the area where weekly sermons were usually held by the [[cleric]] [[Iridan Danlianthol]].{{Cite adventurers league/Blood in the Water|26}}"
