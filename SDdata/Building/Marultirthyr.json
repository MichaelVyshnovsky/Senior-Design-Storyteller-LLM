        "mainbody": "Marultirthyr was a temple dedicated to Deep Sashelas in the Elves Quarter of Myth Nantar.\nThis temple was a five-story structure, with a three-story domed central altar. The structure was composed of translucent pearled glass walls and coral. On the interior underside of the dome was a fresco depicting Deep Sashelas as a handsome aquatic elf, surrounded by a school of dolphins. The temple as a whole was an example of the craftmanship of the late Aryselmalyr period.\nLike all temples of Deep Sashelas in Ser√¥s, Marultirthyr had a specially-marked nave containing a gate linked to the other temples. Activating this gate required one to utter the name of the temple they wished to visit and then whirl in place five times.\nBy 1370 DR, Marultirthyr was among the few sites in the Elves Quarter not to be compromised by the thick, overgrown sheathes of cryscoral that dominated much of the quarter.\nIn the 15 century DR, this temple was in a state of disrepair due to recent attacks on the city by sahuagin. This included part of the structures coral dome having collapsed atop the area where weekly sermons were usually held by the cleric Iridan Danlianthol."
