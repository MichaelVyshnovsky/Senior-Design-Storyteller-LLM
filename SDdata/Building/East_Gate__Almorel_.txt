The East Gate was, aside from the docks, one of two entrances leading into the city of Almorel on the Lake of Mists in the Hordelands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The East Gate was located in the far northeast section of Almorel.
In addition to function as a city gate and mini fortress, the East Gate also served as the tax house for the entire city.
