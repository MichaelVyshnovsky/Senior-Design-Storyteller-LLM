        "mainbody": "olrow Homestead was a farm in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 15 century DR.\nIt lay close to the Delimbiyr River. The homestead itself was situated on top of a hill surrounded by lush fields and orchards, with an enormous tree at the center that shaded the homestead.\nThe homestead was the home of the reclusive druid Arthur Holrow. He supplied the River Shining Tavern in Daggerford with cheese and milk, as well as mustard seeds, and utilized a barge to do so.\nThe hill was in fact the resting place of a slumbering demigod grandchild of Grolantor, the hill giant patron deity. Arthur was unaware of this but had suspicions about the lands inordinate abundance."
