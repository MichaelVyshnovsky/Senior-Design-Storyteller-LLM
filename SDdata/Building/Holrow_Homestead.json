        "mainbody": "'''Holrow Homestead''' was a farm in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "It lay close to the [[Delimbiyr River]]. The homestead itself was situated on top of a hill surrounded by lush fields and orchards, with an enormous [[tree]] at the center that shaded the homestead.",
        "Activities": "The homestead was the home of the reclusive [[druid]] [[Arthur Holrow]]. He supplied the [[River Shining Tavern]] in [[Daggerford]] with [[cheese]] and [[milk]], as well as [[mustard]] seeds, and utilized a barge to do so.\n\nThe hill was in fact the resting place of a slumbering [[demigod]] grandchild of [[Grolantor]], the [[hill giant]] patron [[deity]]. Arthur was unaware of this but had suspicions about the land's inordinate abundance."
