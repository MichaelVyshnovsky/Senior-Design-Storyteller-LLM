The Elfsong Tavern was a well-known tavern in the city of Baldurs Gate.
The tavern was located just inside the gate to Wyrms Crossing on the eastern side of the lower city.
It was a two-story. The ground floor was the taproom featuring the bar and a large number of tables curtained-off into booths by various tapestries.
One of the more notable decorations was a stuffed baby beholder,

The only lighting was provided by the many blue driftglobes that floated about near the ceiling. The furniture was stout wood marked by any number of nicks and slashes from swords and knives. Individual tables were cordoned off with hanging tapestries that provided visual (but not vocal) privacy. The upper floor was filled with private meeting rooms, which could be rented either by the candle&mdashthe time it took a short taper to burn down&mdashor by the evening.
Under Alan Alyths ownership, much of the upper floor was given over to a large dining room with tables for eating and gambling. There were two private dining rooms the Umber Hulk Room and the Displacer Beast Room, named for the mounted heads contained in each. There were also two small guest rooms two larger, more luxurious guest rooms and Alans private bedchamber.
The name derived from an unusual haunting a ghostly female elven voice heard periodically throughout the establishment. The singing was quiet, but could be heard quite clearly. It was most often described as both beautiful and mournful. The identity of the singer was unknown, but it was clear that her song was a lament for a lover lost at sea. No other music was permitted inside the Elfsong.
The establishment served virtually every kind of alcohol known. It was also known for its melted cheese sandwiches (spicing optional), pickles, crab cakes, fishcakes, loaf puddings, cheese-potato soup, and fist-sized twists of dried herring. All food was heavily salted to make patrons drink more. The tavern was also famed for a thick stew beloved by many sick or cold sailors. This stew consisted of all leavings from the rest of the cooking, soured ale, wine dregs, etc. It was thrown into a huge cauldron that was constantly kept at a simmer. A number of folk in Baldurs Gate were quite fond of the stew, and some very reputable folk would come to the Elfsong for the sole purpose of eating it.This appears to be a perpetual stew.
A half-elf woman known as "Lady" Alyth Elendara purchased the tavern for 50,000 gp from an elderly warrior who placed a single condition on the sale that he be allowed to sit in the tavern at all hours in order to hear the song as often as he desired. Elendara was also known to operate an unofficial bank, mostly used by those with large amounts of coin and no good reason to possess it. There was much speculation as to where she stored this money and how it was guarded, but only she knew for sure.
At one point, some decades prior to 1484 DR, ownership of the tavern passed from Lady Alyth to her son, Alan Alyth. Alan maintained all the traditions associated with the establishments ghostly entertainer, and he also continued to offer his mothers informal banking service. By the late 15 century DR, the Hlath patriar family owned the Elfsong, with Alan Alyth running the establishment.
While Alan tended the bar his staff included order-takers, Falten and Yimiur three cooks, Chenna Fatrabbit, Azar Valsheem, and Klav Martilmur and two bouncers, Klank (actually a suit of animated armor) and a half-ogre named Skoona.

The Elfsong catered to persons on the wrong side of the law, but it was more popular with adventurers and independent operators than with the established organizations of the underworld, who tended to frequent the Blushing Mermaid. The city watch had an arrangement with the management and could be expected to maintain a comfortable distance unless a full-scale war erupted inside.
People came to the Elfsong to do business of all sorts, most of it illicit. Fences, smugglers, assassins-for-hire, and many adventurers with hard-earned coin and tall tales to tell would drink at the establishment. Pirates and miscellaneous outlaws from up and down the Sword Coast were often found within as well. Patrons were expected to go armed and were completely responsible for their own safety. Murders were not unheard of, especially upon the dim and winding staircases.

The Elfsong Tavern was one of the citys most popular taverns in the mid-1300s DR.
In the , when the Dark Alliance first began to threaten Baldurs Gate, the Elfsong Tavern was where the fight began. Vahn, Kromlech, and Adrianna were attacked by thieves working for the Dark Alliance and recovered in the Elfsong Tavern. From the Elfsong Tavern they eventually went to the Onyx Tower, where they learned the secrets of the Elfsong. The ghostly elven woman who sang in the tavern sang for her husband, who had worked for the Company of the Crescent Blade. Her husband had left to defend Baldurs Gate and promised one day to return but never did. She continued to sing because she was still waiting for him to come home. In the Onyx Tower, the three adventurers met a ghost who revealed himself to be the husband of the elf woman. The destruction of the Onyx Tower freed the ghost and brought the elf woman peace.
During the Absolute Crisis in the , Duke Belynne Stelmane was murdered by Bhaalists in the Elfsong Tavern. Her hand was severed and her body staged to appear as part of a plan by the Cult of the Absolute to sow fear in the city.
