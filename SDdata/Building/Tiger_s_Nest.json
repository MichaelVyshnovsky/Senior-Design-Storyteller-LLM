        "Description": "Built on the slopes of the [[A-Ling Shan]], and across the [[Jumpa River Gorge|Jumpa Chasm]], the monastery was inaccessible beyond the use of magic.",
        "History": "Built in the age of the [[Imaskari Empire]], the Tiger's Nest was originally an independent monastery of monks who fought against the evils of that empire, aiding the peasants of [[Imaskar]] against their rulers with powerful [[cleric]] spells. Their actions caused them to become known as the [[Invisible Tigers]] among the people, and their hidden fortress was nicknamed the Tiger's Nest.\n\nAfter the fall of the empire, most left the fortress, though the few that remained furthered their powers to the point they could survive on faith alone, without having to eat or even breathe.\n\nAs of [[1359 DR]], only five monks remained at the Tiger's Nest, offering knowledge to those on the path of good. Their odd existence prevented them from fighting themselves, else they would vanish.\n\nThe remaining Tigers viewed the Raja of [[Solon]], [[Ambuchar Devayam]], as their greatest enemy, though could do little against him due to his powers."
