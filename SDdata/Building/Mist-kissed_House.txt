'''Mist-kissed House''' was an [[inn]] and [[festhall]] located in [[Suldolphor]] in far eastern [[Calimshan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The inn was located in the north section of Suldolphor along the perimeter wall.

==Description==
Appearing from the outside to be a simple home of modest decoration, the Mist-kissed House was actually a series of six joined homes that provided discretion for patrons.

==Activities==
The staff used secret passages to complete their duties in silence without disrupting guests. A [[doppelganger]] was kept on staff who, for an additional fee, could impersonate anyone a client desired.
