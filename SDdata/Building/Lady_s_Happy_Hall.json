Though their actions halted the spread of the disease, the Thultyrl reprimanded both high priests for breaking Procampurs district rules, and were reminded that the city and its laws were older than a number of deities.\nAround Kythorn of the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, a convoy secretly transported the torque of faith, a holy item of Tymora, to The Ladys Favor temple in Sevenecho. However, the Vipers bandits attacked the convoy, massacred its guardians, and looted its wealth, including the torque. The Tymorans at the Ladys Happy Hall temple were outraged by the attack and the theft."
