        "History": "It was said that when [[priest]]s of [[Zann]], the [[Zakharan pantheon|Zakharan]] god of learning, discovered writings that they deemed dangerous, but that they could neither keep nor destroy, that they sent them to the Black Library for safe keeping in Hudid. Any dark scholar lucky enough to gain explicit permission from Hudid's caliph to enter the library could find information about [[holy slayer]] fellowships, dark elemental rituals, secrets about the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]], and ancient heretical beliefs from the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]].",
        "Defenses": "A pair of incredibly stout [[dao]] guarded the library."
