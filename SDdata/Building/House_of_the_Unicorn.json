        "mainbody": "The House of the Unicorn was the home of the king of Galadorna in Nethra until the 8 century DR.\nThe palace had gates and a moat.\nThere were tapestries hung until at least the death of King Baerimgrim. The throne room had a golden unicorns head above the throne. There were back stairs in the room, which granted a better view of the room, and there were also at least two entrances.\nThere were hidden passages in the place. One of the rooms was the Redshield Chamber. There were also jakes. One passage leading to the bedroom taken by Elminster had a parallel passage that, in the opposite direction, led to a sequence of dark, neglected chambers, which terminated at a shrine to Bane in a high-ceilinged room sporting a tapestry as tall as a cottage. The room had flagstone floors, pews, a Black Hand of Bane, and two guardian helmed horrors.\nThe castle had battlements and more than one tower.\nThe House of the Unicorn was the dwelling of King Baerimgrim until the , when he tried to name a successor. His Court Mage, Ilgrist, killed him shortly after the successor was named and styled himself King Nadrathen of Galadorna. His reign was cut short when the Chosen of Mystra Elminster Aumar fought with him, allowing his master, the sorceress Dasumia, to slay Nadrathen. She then crowned herself Queen of Galadorna, with Elminster as seneschal.\nDasumia remained queen until later into the year,Per the Google Books version of Temptation, its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster theyre in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrins warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. when she revealed to Elminster she was actually Mystra, and the two of them left Galadorna."
