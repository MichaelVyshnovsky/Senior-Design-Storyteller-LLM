        "mainbody": "Arthane Furnace was a bloomery east of Beliard during the 15 century DR.\nArthane Furnace was a large furnace for smelting iron ore and forging raw blades from it. It used ore from nearby Arthane-owned mines, charcoal fuel from local felsul and blueleaf trees on Arthane properties, and quenching vine oil from local Arthane and Secomber-based sources. It was linked by merchants map to Samrils Fine Blades in Secomber who finished the blades before sending them on to the Arthane Armory in Waterdeep for sale.\nThe Furnace and the greater business was founded by Eldegul Arthane, who sought to fill the gap left by declining dwarven industry in the North."
