        "mainbody": "'''Arthane Furnace''' was a bloomery east of [[Beliard]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Services": "Arthane Furnace was a large furnace for smelting [[iron]] ore and forging raw blades from it. It used ore from nearby Arthane-owned mines, [[charcoal]] fuel from local [[felsul]] and [[blueleaf]] trees on Arthane properties, and quenching vine [[oil]] from local Arthane and [[Secomber]]-based sources. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in Secomber who finished the blades before sending them on to [[the Arthane Armory]] in [[Waterdeep]] for sale.",
        "History": "The Furnace and the greater business was founded by [[Eldegul Arthane]], who sought to fill the gap left by declining [[dwarf|dwarven]] industry in [[the North]]."
