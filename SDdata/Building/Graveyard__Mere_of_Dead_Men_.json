The bigger crypt held many more treasures, but many more undead, led by the shadow priest.\nThis graveyard was one of many sites where the King of Shadows clashed with the Neverwinter army. The graveyard was built to contain many dead soldiers, without any names.\nThe graveyard was infested by zombies and skeletons when the shadow priest was ordered to raise an army, by Black Garius demands. Commander Tann and his men (Bruneil, Blaine and Garret) were captured. The Kalach-Cha couldve rescued them (except Garret, who died) and lead them out of the graveyard."
