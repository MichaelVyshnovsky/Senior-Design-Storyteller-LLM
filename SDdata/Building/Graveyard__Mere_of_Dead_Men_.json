The graveyard was built to contain many dead soldiers, without any names.\n\nThe graveyard was infested by zombies and skeletons when the shadow priest was ordered to raise an army, by [[Black Garius]]' demands. [[Tann|Commander Tann]] and his men ([[Bruneil]], [[Blaine]] and [[Garret]]) were captured. The [[Kalach-Cha]] could've rescued them (except Garret, who died) and lead them out of the graveyard."
