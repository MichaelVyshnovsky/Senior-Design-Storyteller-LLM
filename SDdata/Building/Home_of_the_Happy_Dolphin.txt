The Home of the Happy Dolphin was an inn located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, along the banks of Al-Sarif River.
Located in the Trade Harbor district, this typical inn had twenty tables filling the common room. Wide windows lined the front of the inn, allowing cool breezes from the harbor to circulate through the common room.
The fish stew of this inn was a favorite among locals.
The Home of the Happy Dolphin was owned by Samsi Farlak.
