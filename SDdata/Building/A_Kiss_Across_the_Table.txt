A Kiss Across the Table was a shop located in Mosstone that specialized in dresses, gowns, wigs, perfumes, and other goods popular among women.
The Kiss was stock-full of miscellaneous dainty things, with its shelves always stocked with various perfumes, love potions, lingerie, and fanciful masquerade masks. Many of the gowns sold here could be considered daring and quite flattering. Among other goods, the Kiss carried beautiful flowers enchanted with the neverwither spell, cosmetics, false fingernails, eyelashes, wigs, "whirlglow" candle-lanterns, corsets, and various small heart-shaped gift boxes.
The store also had some more unique items, such as many uncomfortable but attractive-looking spike-heeled shoes. Some of the footwear found here was shaped out of mock-monster claws or were thigh-high lace-up boots. It was the only place on Firedrake Bay to purchase boots and corsets made of bright red leather.
Maeragha had more practical—for adventurers, that is—stock in her cluttered cellars. She kept her huge collection of disguises there, including various false noses, prostheses, and body paddings. She also could be hired for her uncanny vocal mimicry skills.
Maeragha Olgarlar was the jolly and matronly store proprietor. She was beloved for her comforting personality and wise advice by the local dancers and ladies offering companionship who were her main clientele and often regarded Maeragha as their mother-figure.
Maeragha Olgarlar loved her job and loved helping her clients to look their best. Once, she even enthusiastically aided Mirt the Moneylender by disguising him as a "lace-bosomed matron" for the adventurer to lure a band of brigands into a trap.
