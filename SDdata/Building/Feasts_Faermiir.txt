Feasts Faermiir was one of the most-distinguished festhalls found in the great city of Myth Drannor. It was considered a center of multiculturalism in the city, where business-owners could learn the specific customs, artistic preferences, and culinary tastes of the numerous races that composed the City of Song.
The hall was located on Gardners Ride in the culturally eclectic district of Dlabraddath.
The Treants Treat comprised a ground-level building and the three underground levels that descended beneath, which included the taverns taproom. The subterranean walls of the establishment were entwined with the roots of Myth Drannors great many trees.
First and foremost, the establishment was the premiere venue for parties and revels thrown by the Myth Drannan elven nobility. However it also served as the guildhall for the citys Restaurateurs Guild, the local association of business-owners that ran the citys numerous fest-, dance-, and dining halls.
