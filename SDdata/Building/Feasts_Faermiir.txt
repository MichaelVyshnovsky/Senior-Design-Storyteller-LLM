'''Feasts Faermiir''' was one of the most-distinguished festhalls found in the great city of [[Myth Drannor]]. It was considered a center of multiculturalism in the city, where business-owners could learn the specific customs, artistic preferences, and culinary tastes of the numerous races that composed the City of Song.

==Location==
The hall was located on [[Gardner's Ride]] in the culturally eclectic district of [[Dlabraddath]].

==Structure==
The Treants' Treat comprised a ground-level building and the three underground levels that descended beneath, which included the tavern's taproom. The subterranean walls of the establishment were entwined with the roots of Myth Drannor's great many trees.

==Services==
First and foremost, the establishment was the premiere venue for parties and revels thrown by the Myth Drannan elven nobility. However it also served as the guildhall for the city's [[Restaurateur's Guild]], the local association of business-owners that ran the city's numerous fest-, dance-, and dining halls.
