        "mainbody": "Lariss Curios was one of a few shops in all of Faer√ªn that bought and sold magic items. It was located in Hillsfar.\nThe shop was found in the south central part of the city.\nA pair of stone golems shaped like gynosphinxs guarded the establishment.\nThough the prices were certainly high, the shop did indeed provide magic items for anyone with enough coin to purchase them. Other available items included spell components, gems, and artwork. The shopkeeper was known for mercilessly haggling with adventurers to get their prices down until they agreed to his terms.\nAs the name would imply, the shop was owned by a gruff man named Laris."
