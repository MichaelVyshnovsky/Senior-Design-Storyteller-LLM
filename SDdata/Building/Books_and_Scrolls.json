        "mainbody": "ooks and Scrolls was a small shop located in the Pilgrims District of Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nBooks and Scrolls was jammed with all kinds of books, scrolls, and maps. The items were not sorted into any convenient system of organization.\nAziza the Seer purchased volumes without worrying about their subject matter. As a member of the Readers, she simply needed to read anything to power her strange magic.\nPatient customers who were willing to spend hours digging through the mess of her shop could potentially be rewarded with stumbling across a rare tome containing forbidden magic or other wondrous lore.\nAziza owned and operated this establishment."
