'''The Ale and Rabbit''' was an inn and bathhouse in the [[halfling]] village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
It was one of the biggest and tallest buildings in the small village.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The only inn in the last village up the [[Delimbiyr River]], The Ale and Rabbit served the majority of inhabitants. It was also the last stop for the trappers and explorers that went north, and probably the first for those that returned.

==Services==
Guests could stay the night in the large common room for 5 [[sp]] or in a pricey private room for 3 [[gp]]. The inn also provided several baths; these were free with an overnight stay or could be rented separately for 5 sp.

As the name suggested, the menu was limited: there was [[ale]], and [[rabbit]]. However, being [[halfling]]s, the food was delicious.
