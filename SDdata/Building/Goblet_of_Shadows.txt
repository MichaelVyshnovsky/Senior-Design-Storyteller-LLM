The '''Goblet of Shadows''' was a tavern in [[Nethra]] during the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Interior==
The place was a maze of arches, beaded curtains, and tables. There were also pillars.

===Atmosphere===
The Goblet was a shady place, where bar fights drew not just bets, but thrown bottles from strangers, and death screams did not disrupt activities, instead drawing applause. Bizarrely, it was not even the wildest tavern in the city.

==Services==
The place served alcohol, including [[heartsfire]], and had dancing ladies.

==History==
One evening in the late {{yearlinkName|764}},Per the Google Books version of ''Temptation'', its realmslore section declares the events of the first part to happen in around five years starting 759 DR. In the first chapter, Nuressa, the warrior, tells Elminster they're in early Mirtul. If it is assumed that the events happened in at most five and a half years, as more than five and a half years becomes around six years, then the last events in part 1 must happen at most during Uktar of 764. Given Feldrin's warning during the coronation that the Lords of Laothkund are already planning an attack, this timeline seems plausible. Further development may yet alter the result. shortly before the invasion of Nethra by the Lords of [[Laothkund]], the guards [[Delver (guard)|Delver]] and [[Ingrath]] were approached by Queen [[Dasumia]] of [[Galadorna]], who was at the moment posing as one of the tavern dancers. She revealed her identity to the guards and proposed they go somewhere more private. This was witnessed by the scholars [[Tabarast]] and [[Beldrune]], who were drinking at the time; the trio was also followed by the wandering [[elven]] [[mage]] [[Ilbryn Starym]].
