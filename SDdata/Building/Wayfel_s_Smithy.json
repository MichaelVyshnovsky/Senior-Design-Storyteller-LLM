        "mainbody": "'''Wayfel's Smithy''' was a lowâ€“quality forge that operated in the [[Farmers' Quarter]] of [[Daggerford]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The smithy was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford at the junction of [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] and [[Horse Way]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}",
        "Services": "The only thing lower than [[Wayfel]]'s prices was the quality of his work. He did not come close to competing with the fine pieces forged at [[Derval's Bright Blade]].",
        "History": "Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1370}} Wayfel was hired to construct a tower that overlooked Daggerford's River Gate. Unfortunately, he failed to anchor the structure to the solid rock beneath the [[Delimbiyr River]]. When the river flooded, the tower collapsed.\n\nWayfel was not offered any construction contracts after that fiasco.",
        "Lore": "When referring to the blacksmith [[Cromach]], locals said his work was \"as shaky as Wayfel's best.\""
