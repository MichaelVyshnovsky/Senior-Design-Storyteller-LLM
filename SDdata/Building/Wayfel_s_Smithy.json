        "mainbody": "ayfels Smithy was a lowâ€“quality forge that operated in the Farmers Quarter of Daggerford during the 14 century DR.\nThe smithy was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford at the junction of Wall Street and Horse Way.\nThe only thing lower than Wayfels prices was the quality of his work. He did not come close to competing with the fine pieces forged at Dervals Bright Blade.\nSome time around the  Wayfel was hired to construct a tower that overlooked Daggerfords River Gate. Unfortunately, he failed to anchor the structure to the solid rock beneath the Delimbiyr River. When the river flooded, the tower collapsed.\nWayfel was not offered any construction contracts after that fiasco.\nWhen referring to the blacksmith Cromach, locals said his work was \"as shaky as Wayfels best.\""
