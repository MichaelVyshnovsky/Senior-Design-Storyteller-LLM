        "mainbody": "he Harpers House was the name given to the personal residence of Chesslyn Onaubra, the local guardswoman that offered her home as a safehouse to her fellow members of the Harpers.\nIt was located in the southeast side of Mulmaster, not too far away from the citys docks.\nPerfect for spies and information-gatherers, the home was a rather non-descript brick-and-wood building that did not attract unneeded attention to Chesslyns comings and goings.\nWith its cozy and welcoming atmosphere, the Harpers House was a welcome refuge for agents operating in the harsh city of Mulmaster."
