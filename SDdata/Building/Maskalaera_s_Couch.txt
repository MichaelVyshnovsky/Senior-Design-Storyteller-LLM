'''Maskalaera's Couch''' was an [[inn]], [[festhall]], and [[tavern]] located in [[Suldolphor]] in far eastern [[Calimshan]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The inn was located in the west section of Suldolphor near the [[Golden Gate]].

==Activities==
Maskalaera's Couch catered to a raucous crowd and was always loud and energetic. Noise complaints in the neighborhood became so common that the owner of the establishment eventually purchased all of the surrounding buildings and converted them to warehouses, inadvertantly turning the block into a dangerous part of town at night as it became a haven for criminals.
