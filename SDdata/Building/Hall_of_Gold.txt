The '''Hall of Gold''' was a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Waukeen]] in the city of [[Port Nyanzaru]], as well as one of the city's most affluent banks.

==Location==
This temple was located in Port Nyanzaru's [[Market Ward]], situated atop [[Mount Sibasa]].

==Structure==
The Hall of Gold was named for shining, golden roof, which many in the city believed was really sheathed in pure burnished gold. In actuality, the roof was merely painted golden, but whenever [[the sun]] was shining its light would glint off the roof for miles out to sea.

==Activities==
This temple arranged charitable events and projects that helped improved conditions within Port Nyanzaru.

==Inhabitants==
In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the chief [[priest]] of this temple was [[Sibonseni]], Mother of Prosperity, one of the most influential residents of Port Nyanzaru next to the merchant princes.
