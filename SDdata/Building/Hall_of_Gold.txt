The Hall of Gold was a temple dedicated to the goddess Waukeen in the city of Port Nyanzaru, as well as one of the citys most affluent banks.
This temple was located in Port Nyanzarus Market Ward, situated atop Mount Sibasa.
The Hall of Gold was named for shining, golden roof, which many in the city believed was really sheathed in pure burnished gold. In actuality, the roof was merely painted golden, but whenever the sun was shining its light would glint off the roof for miles out to sea.
This temple arranged charitable events and projects that helped improved conditions within Port Nyanzaru.
In the 15 century DR, the chief priest of this temple was Sibonseni, Mother of Prosperity, one of the most influential residents of Port Nyanzaru next to the merchant princes.
