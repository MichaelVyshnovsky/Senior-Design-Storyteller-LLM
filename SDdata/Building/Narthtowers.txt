'''Narthtowers''' was the abandoned [[wizard]] tower in the foothills of the northern border of [[Halruaa]].

==History==
The tower was once owned by the [[Halruaan]] wizard [[Thongameir Halargoth]], known also as "''Stormspells''". After his death, no one in the region had figured out how to clear out the tower of Thongameir's vast collection of murderous version of a wide varieties of plantlife.
