        "mainbody": "underman Brewery was a ramshackle old barn that was converted to a brewery in Harrowdale.\nThe brewery was located near the end of Lancegallop Lane on the east side of town near the coast.\nThe most anyone saw of the brewery was the main vat room located on the ground level. It was here that the tasty Old Smoke ale was made.\nGunderman Brewmaster owned the brewery and ran it with his three enormous but well-meaning sons and a host of human, dwarf and gnome employees, who seemed to be constantly expanding the cellars of the brewery or installing pumps to keep seepage from the Dragon Reach at bay."
