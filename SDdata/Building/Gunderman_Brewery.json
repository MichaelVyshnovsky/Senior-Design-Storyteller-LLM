        "mainbody": "'''Gunderman Brewery''' was a ramshackle old barn that was converted to a brewery in [[New Velar|Harrowdale]].",
        "Locations": "The brewery was located near the end of [[Lancegallop Lane]] on the east side of town near the coast.",
        "Description": "The most anyone saw of the brewery was the main vat room located on the ground level. It was here that the tasty [[Old Smoke]] [[ale]] was made.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Gunderman Brewmaster]] owned the brewery and ran it with his three enormous but well-meaning sons and a host of [[human]], [[dwarf]] and [[gnome]] employees, who seemed to be constantly expanding the cellars of the brewery or installing pumps to keep seepage from the [[Dragon Reach]] at bay."
