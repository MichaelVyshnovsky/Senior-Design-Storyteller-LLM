The Baths of Kordek were a bathhouse ruin in Medinat Muskawoon.
The baths of Kordek were the newest of the baths still remaining in the city.
It was cross-shaped, with a ceramic dome top. The exterior was rugged and simple, opened on the north and south with broad, squat arches. These baths were the only ones at the time to allow women, though they were segregated, and they had been built over a sulfurous spring. There were four steps up at the entrance arches, and then four steps down into a semicircular pool on each side.
At the center were two golden grate-shaped pieces.
