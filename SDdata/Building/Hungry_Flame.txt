The '''Hungry Flame''' was a run down tavern found in the city of [[Helm's Hold]] ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
The staff of the Hungry Flame were particularly discourteous to any patrons who did not bear the [[spellscar]]s that were common among so many the Hold's residents.

==History==
As of the 1470s DR, the tavern was the meeting place and headquarters for the [[Heirs of Azure]], the group of spellscarred political activists that fought out against the "pureblood" citizens of Helm's Hold.
