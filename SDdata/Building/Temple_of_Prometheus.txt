The '''Temple of Prometheus''' was a temple dedicated to the [[Olympian pantheon|Olympian]] god [[Prometheus]] in the city of [[Medinat Muskawoon]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|101}}

==Location==
The temple was due east of the [[Great Hall of the Pasha]] in Medinat Muskawoon. It faced west and slightly south, with its back towards the rising sun in remembrance of the griffon-vulture that would devour Prometheus's liver each morning.

==Structure==
The temple was just twenty columns on a raised platform, holding up the roof {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} above the platform. There was only one wall, facing east, with a {{SIAdj|12|inch|long=yes}} diameter window, and a [[brazier]] before it.

==History==
There were several temples to Prometheus in the fertile valley of the river [[Athis]], brought by the travelers from other realms far removed from [[Realmspace]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Torches lit from this shrine had the power to drive away the conjured [[snake|asps]] in the [[Temple of Ra]]. If lit by the sun's rays concentrated by the round window behind it, these torches would not stop burning for as long as they remained in Medinat Muskawoon.
