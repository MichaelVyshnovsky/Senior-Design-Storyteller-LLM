        "History": "As of the 14{{th}} century DR, Sendril's Silks was ran by [[Ucharntar Sendril]]. According to [[Elminster Aumar]]'s investigation, Ucharntar was one of the most active agents of the [[Cult of Tiamat]] at the time. The old wizard informed the [[Harpers]] of his findings and recommended for the agents to watch Sendril's Silks as the cult's shillings indicated inevitable expansion into [[Sembia]] and [[Westgate]]."
