The '''Sornstern Family Gardens''' were a part of the [[Sornstern]] residence in [[Suzail]] in [[Cormyr]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
The gardens were ringed with tall and spike-topped walls. There was at least one [[shadowtop]] tree, and it had a bower underneath.

==History==
The Sornstern family gardens were the favored location for secret conversations between [[Delasko Sornstern]] and [[Broryn Windstag]], who were often overheard by [[Talonar Winter]], a [[War Wizard]]. One particular talk of theirs covered [[blueflame ghost]]s, which they had reason to believe were controlled by the young Lord [[Marlin Stormserpent]], and Lord [[Haedro Sornstern]]'s contact with [[Elminster Aumar]], a renegade wizard.
