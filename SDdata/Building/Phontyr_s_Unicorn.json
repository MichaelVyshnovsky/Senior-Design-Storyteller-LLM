        "mainbody": "'''Phontyr's Unicorn''' was a famous inn in the city of [[Elturel]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "It was located in Elturel's Dock District.",
        "Legends": "This locale had long been known for the mysterious apparition of a [[unicorn]], glowing blue-white and ethereally beautiful, occurring on misty nights and seen to prance around and then gallop off, all in unnerving silence and with hooves never contacting the ground. This was no ghost-story—the unicorn was sighted over twenty times a year by the 1360s DR. According to legend, those who could follow the unicorn and not lose sight of it would be led to a great treasure. The fast and fortunate few who did won great wealth: two adventuring bands were led to lost [[dwarf|dwarven]] holds near Elturel where they discovered hoards of [[gold]], [[silver]], and fine ores, and a third literally fell into the tomb of an ancient mage in the woods. Needless to say, the inn was a popular hangout for inexperienced adventurers hoping to strike it lucky, staying up at nights with [[mount]]s saddled and ready or even flight [[magic]] on hand.\n\nHowever, the origin of the unicorn was unknown and debated. Some presumed it to be a manifestation of the goddess [[Mielikki]], the Forest Queen, or of [[Lurue]], the Unicorn Queen, both of whom had the unicorn as their symbol. Faithful of Lurue knelt and chanted their adoration when they saw it. However, still others maintained the unicorn was actually a [[sorceress]] [[polymorph]]ed and stuck in the form of a unicorn forever. She was said to be an ally, lifelong friend, and even love of the long-deceased mage [[Phontyr Wonderspell]], who was unable to free her from magic more powerful than this own.",
        "History": "Phontyr's house once stood on this locale, but after he died it burned down in circumstances considered mysterious.\n\nLater, it was the site of a factory. It was later converted into the ramshackle inn known as Phontyr's Unicorn by [[1358 DR]].\n\nIn the mid-1360s DR, the inn was purchased by cultists of Lurue so they could be close to the unicorn apparition and revere it. They also renovated and greatly improved the inn, still called Phontyr's Unicorn. He did not report sighting the unicorn, however.",
        "Structure": "The inn was built in a converted factory, which was originally of fairly ramshackle construction. However, it was greatly improved by later owners.",
        "Interior": "''Circa'' 1366 DR, the inn was superbly appointed, with deep green carpets and matching tapestries on all the walls, which kept the rooms quiet. These rooms were spacious and free of drafts, and held canopied, curtain beds. There was a fine dining room and several lounges and meeting rooms provided for guests to use. Well-placed ''[[glowing globe]]s'' shed dim lighting, while [[fern]]s grew in hanging baskets. Images of the famous unicorn appeared everywhere, in decorative carvings and painted shields and the tapestries bearing the head of a watchful unicorn, most of them enchanted to glow blue-white like the actual unicorn.",
        "Atmosphere": "''Circa'' 1358 DR, Phontyr's Unicorn was considered an eccentric but friendly place. A lot of late-night business took place here, including shady dealings.",
        "Staff": "''Circa'' 1366 DR, the staff were [[human]] men and women of considerate, enthusiastic, and soft-spoken character. They went around the inn quietly but seeing to their patrons' every need and want. They would even play [[:Category:Games_(in-universe)|cards and board games]] with them if they were idle or lonely, but would not gamble for coin. They wore green livery adorned with the inn's unicorn symbol.",
        "Services": "Rooms at Phontyr's Unicorn cost 16 [[gp]] per person per night, with stabling of [[mount]]s an additional 2 [[gp]]. An eveningfeast meal cost 1 gp, which included a bottle of the dry white house [[wine]] (\"delightful\" in Volo's opinion), with extra bottles starting at 6 gp per bottle. The wine cellar was as well-stocked as any in [[Waterdeep]], with similar prices.\n\nThe menu tended towards roasts, soups, and a few other notable dishes. The soups were starters, from [[boar]] hock soup for traditional tastes to [[pheasant tail soup]], an Elturian favorite, and cold [[potato leek soup|potato-and-leek soup]] for the adventurous. For mains, there were various well-seasoned roast meats cooked to a delicious brown, and fried root vegetables covered in gravy; the roast boar with all the trimmings was particularly good. Another excellent main dish was [[shark]] steak fried in seed oil. Outside eveningfeasts, complimentary  glasses of the house wine, slices of [[cheese]], and salted biscuits were always available, set out on trays and free to take.\n\nAs Lord [[Dhelt]] decreed that inns and taverns could not operate under the same roof, and inns could not serve drinks, Phontyr's Unicorn was expressly an inn."
