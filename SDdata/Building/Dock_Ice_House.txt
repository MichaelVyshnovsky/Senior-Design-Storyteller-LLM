The '''Dock Ice House''' was a cold-storage business located on the docks of [[Ravens Bluff]] within the city's [[Harbor District (Ravens Bluff)|Harbor District]], during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its operation was critically important to the local fisheries and seafood vendors, as they allowed their goods to be safely transported throughout the city and beyond.

==Location==
The Ice House was centrally located within the neighborhood's docks, just a ways north of [[Gulp Lane]] in the [[Silverscales]] neighborhood.
