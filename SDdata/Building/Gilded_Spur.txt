The Gilded Spur was an inn in Amnwater, Amn.
The establishment offered gambling facilities aimed at the passing caravan trade, but this made it less popular with locals.
The hostess was Krigar, whose lover was the proprietor, Lord Jhanos Yhliivast.
As of 1368 DR, it was the largest and the newest inn in Amnwater, owned and operated by the Yhliivast family.
