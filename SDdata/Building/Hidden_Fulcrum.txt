The Hidden Fulcrum was the audience chamber of the Great Khan of the Dao, Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil.
This secret chamber was hidden within the Sevenfold Mazework on the Elemental Plane of Earth. It was so secret that many noble dao did not even know where it was located. Any visitor to the Hidden Fulcrum was blindfolded to prevent them from learning the route to the chamber.
