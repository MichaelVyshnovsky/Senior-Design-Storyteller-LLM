The '''Hidden Fulcrum''' was the audience chamber of the Great Khan of the Dao, [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil]].

==Location==
This secret chamber was hidden within the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. It was so secret that many [[noble dao]] did not even know where it was located. Any visitor to the Hidden Fulcrum was blindfolded to prevent them from learning the route to the chamber.
