The '''Lonely Citadel''' was a gargantuan tower that was originally of [[Faerûn]].

==Location==
This tower formed the top of a spire in the mountain range known as the [[Ice Mountains]]. It resided north of the dwarven stronghold, [[Citadel Adbar]].

==Structure==
Only a single turret was attached to this tower.

==History==
In [[1365 DR]], the Lonely Citadel was spirited away from the [[Prime Material plane]] in a great burst of divine energy. The citadel later appeared in [[Mount Celestia]] when [[Torm]] was elevated to the status of a [[lesser deity]]. The tower itself came to form the heart of [[Trueheart]] in [[Mercuria]].
