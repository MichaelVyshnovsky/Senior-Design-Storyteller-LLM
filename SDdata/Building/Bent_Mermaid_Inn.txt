The '''Bent Mermaid Inn''' was an inn at the edge of [[Tidetown]] in [[Westgate]] which was a hangout for pirates and other assorted trash.

==Structure==
The inn was best known for a figurehead of a bent-over [[mermaid]] out the front of the establishment.

==Location==
The inn was located on the waterfront near the center of the city.

==History==
The inn was ran by [[Glarn]], the [[half-orc]] proprietor and bartender in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. He offered strong spirits, [[ale]]s, and [[wine]]s, such as [[Thayan Red]] and [[Brother Tobias' 1368]]. Rooms were available and the orc was always ready to chat and share the latest rumors at no additional expense to the guests.
