        "mainbody": "The Happy Cow was a popular tavern located in the town of Daggerford that catered to the \"salt of the earth\" types of people.\nThe tavern was located along the Farmers Road near the Farmers Gate in northern Daggerford.\nThe medium sized building stood close to the citys northern gate, also known as the Farmers Gate. The visiting farmers were greeting with a large painted sign with the taverns name and an image of a happily content cow.\nIn addition to the usual services provided by inns of the North, the Happy Cow provided moneylending services on behalf of Koggin.\nThe drinks menu in 1372 DR included black grog ale for 5 gp, bitterroot beer for 10 gp, Knee-Cracker for 20 gp, and guldathan nectar for 50 gp.\nIn addition to Lily and Koggin, the Happy Cow employed over 20 members of the Hardcheese family, from cousins and uncles to other distant relatives.\nAmong the inns regulars was a half-elf by the name of Zira. While she took this form while lending her fondness to the Hardcheese family, Zira was in fact a bronze dragon called Zirazylym. \nWhen Fulbar was running this tavern it was known for catering primarily to local farmers and Daggerford townsmen, with soldiers and adventurers receiving less of a warm welcome. During that time, Demetira Landscraper was serving as the taverns manager, keeping track of the books and finances of the happy establishment.\nThe tavern employed a cheerful elven bard Jorey Fontalas circa 1372 DR.\nAround the late 14 century DR the tavern was run by a former adventurer halfling named Fulbar Hardcheese, who provided customers with cheese made on his family farm and almond beer he blended himself.\nFulbar kept hidden deep underneath the tavern a dragons hoard, obtained in the backlands during his adventuring days, and used that extra funding to maintain low prices.\nIn 1372 DR, during the short reign of Matagar Bugo as the Duke, Raegen Brunegar could be found staying at the Happy Cow, before joining with the group of adventurers investigating late Dukes mysterious \"death\".\nAs of the late 15 century DR it was still being run by members of the Hardcheese family, among them the owners, Koggin and Lily."
