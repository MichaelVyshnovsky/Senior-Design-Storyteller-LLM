Its owner Fulbar Hardcheese, serves up a frothy tankard and is full of friendly gossip on the town and its inhabitants.''|Guard Captain [[Frederick]]}}",
        "Location": "The tavern was located along the [[Farmer's Road]] near the [[Farmer's Gate]] in northern Daggerford.{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}",
        "Exterior": "The medium sized building stood close to the city's northern gate, also known as the Farmers' Gate. The visiting farmers were greeting with a large painted sign with the tavern's name and an image of a happily content [[cow]].",
        "Services": "In addition to the usual services provided by inns of [[the North]], the Happy Cow provided moneylending services on behalf of Koggin.\n\nThe drinks menu in 1372 DR included [[black grog ale]] for 5 [[gp]], [[bitterroot beer]] for 10 gp, [[Knee-Cracker]] for 20 gp, and [[guldathan nectar]] for 50 gp.",
        "Inhabitants": "In addition to Lily and Koggin, the Happy Cow employed over 20 members of the Hardcheese family, from cousins and uncles to other distant relatives.\n\nAmong the inns regulars was a [[half-elf]] by the name of [[Zirazylym|Zira]]. While she took this form while lending her fondness to the Hardcheese family, Zira was in fact a [[bronze dragon]] called [[Zirazylym]]. \n\nWhen Fulbar was running this tavern it was known for catering primarily to local farmers and Daggerford townsmen, with soldiers and adventurers receiving less of a warm welcome.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|36}} During that time, [[Demetira Landscraper]] was serving as the tavern's manager, keeping track of the books and finances of the happy establishment.\n\nThe tavern employed a cheerful [[elf|elven]] [[bard]] [[Jorey Fontalas]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Around the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] the tavern was run by a former adventurer [[halfling]] named Fulbar Hardcheese, who provided customers with cheese made on his family farm and almond beer he blended himself.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast|36}}\n\nFulbar kept hidden deep underneath the tavern a dragon's hoard, obtained in the [[backlands]] during his adventuring days, and used that extra funding to maintain low prices.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], during the short reign of [[Matagar Bugo]] as the Duke, [[Raegen Brunegar]] could be found staying at the Happy Cow, before joining with the group of adventurers investigating late Duke's mysterious \"death\".\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] it was still being run by members of the [[Hardcheese]] family, among them the owners, Koggin and Lily."
