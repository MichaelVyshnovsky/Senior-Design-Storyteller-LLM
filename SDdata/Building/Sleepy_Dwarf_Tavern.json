        "History": "In [[Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{LCRB}} the street in front of Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern erupted in violence. [[Church of Cyric|Clergy]] of [[Cyric]], the Mad God, clashed in a vicious battle with [[Church of Bane|priests]] of [[Bane]]. To make matters worse, Banites were joined by devotees of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] halfway through. The battle resumed with numerous civilian casualties and massive property damage for both Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf. Only one combatant was found still alive by the Ravens Bluff's guardsmen. One notable individual who was severely injured in the skirmish was [[Meegan]], a bouncer of the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern who aided the guard in stopping the street-side war. The incident was reported by [[Silva Sinderan]] in that month's ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]].\n\nAnother attack happened in front of the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern in [[Eleasis]] of the same year when the city of Ravens Bluff became a target for the dreaded [[tanar'ri]]. Civilians left the tavern and cut through a nearby alleyway where some unknown force ''[[summon]]ed'' tanar'ri that massacred the group, claiming the lives of five civilians. The fiends, in turn, attracted the attention of nearby city patrol that ended up dispatching the planar beings.{{Cite trumpeter/2-1/Golden Rooster's Survive Attack|1-2}}"
