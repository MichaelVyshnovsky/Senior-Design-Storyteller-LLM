        "mainbody": "The '''Godswalk Keep'''  was a castle located in the [[Barony of Great Oak]] within the [[Border Kingdoms]]. The keep was so named because of the presence of several [[deity|deitie]]s on random nights.",
        "Activities": "Once a proud fortress during the height of [[Netheril]], the Godswalk Keep was home to bizarre activity. For unknown reasons, an [[avatar]] of [[Garagos]] would appear within the keep on random nights, slaughtering anything he came into contact with. Avatars of [[Jergal]] and [[Sharess]] appeared on the same night. Garagos always tried to slay them but was never successful. He vented his frustrations with great screams giving the bizarre event the name the [[Meeting of the Three]]."
