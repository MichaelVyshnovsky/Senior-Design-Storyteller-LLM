The Solarium was a temple dedicated to Horus-Re, the Lord of the Sun within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
The temple was located in the capital city of Skuld in Mulhorand.
The Solarium was a pyramid, the top half of which was made from shining glass. A ring of alternating white and pink marble towers surrounded the pyramid. Walkways connected the towers at different heights.
The towers surrounding the Solarium served administrative purposes for Horus-Res clergy and the government of Skuld.
