        "mainbody": "'''Morninggold Keep''', also called '''Gold Keep''' and '''Castle Morninggold''', was the county seat of [[Morninggold|County Morninggold]] in the [[Golden Marches]] of [[Tethyr]]. It was the former home of then-countess and later queen [[Zaranda Star]].",
        "Location": "The small keep was located in a broad valley around a corner of foothills in the northern regions of the [[Iltkazar Highlands]], near the [[Shining Stream]].\n\nWhite and brownish-red [[cow]]s grazed in the fields surrounding the manor.",
        "Structure": "The building was a fortified house, with two- and three-story sections, constructed with [[granite]] from the [[Snowflake Mountains]]. The pitched roof was tiled in red half-tubes. A stone path led up to the arched front doorway.\n\nAttached to the back of the house was a circular tower, which was older than the rest of the structure. Its smooth rounded stones were a yellowed fieldstone, which looked like gold when the setting sun shone on it. Its lower heights were covered in ivy.\n\nSurrounding the main manorhouse were a few other stone buildings, including a set of stables. There was also a vegetable garden.",
        "Defenses": "There was no wall or moat, but the building was surrounded with thorny rosebushes. It had been built and/or rebuilt with defense in mind. The earlier low, broad, arched windows had been covered with stone and positioned higher in the form of narrower slits crossed with [[wikipedia:Arrow loop|arrow loops]]. The upper windows of the tower were open to the air but crossed with bars.",
        "Interior": {
            "Furnishings": "During Zaranda's ownership, the master bedroom contained a chest of drawers decorated with relief sculptures of smiling [[goblin]] heads. The bed was made of [[oak]] and had four spiraling columns supporting a [[silk]] canopy with fringes, which Zaranda had looted off a [[Tuigan]] chieftain during the [[Tuigan War]]. The bedspread was embroidered with images of [[elk]]s and [[penguin]]s."
        },
        "History": "The keep and its county at first belonged to the [[Gulderhorn]] family of Tethyr.\n\nAfter the fall of the country into anarchy on the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], former adventuress and commander in the Tuigan War Zaranda Star used the spoils of that war However, her funds began running low, so she sought a means to pay off her debt and retire at the keep. Her solution was to obtain expensive magical items from [[Unther]] and [[Thay]] and then sell them in the city of [[Zazesspur]].\n\nThe journey did not end quite as she had planned, and she found herself entangled in war and political intrigue that ultimately led to her rising to the leadership of a resistance movement and her crowning as the queen of [[Tethyr]] over the course of a year. At the end of the [[Reclamation Wars]] in {{Yearlink|1369}}, Queen Zaranda restored Aalangama Gulderhorn's lands and titles back to her family as a reward for her bravery and leadership in the battle.",
        "Inhabitants": "When Zaranda Star lived in the house, she was served by the [[bugbear]] [[Gisbertus]] as a butler and head steward and sometimes cook.\n\nCountess Gulderhorn, the keep's owner from {{Yearlink|1369}}, split her time equally between the keep and [[Mount Noblesse]], the headquarters of the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]]."
