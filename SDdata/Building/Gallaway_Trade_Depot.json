        "mainbody": "The Gallaway Trade Depot shop in Targos was a part of the prosperous Gallaway Trading Coster that operated in the Northwest Faer√ªn as early as the late 13 century DR.\nThe Gallaway Trade Depot stood atop a cliff in Targos, overlooking the towns docks and warehouses that belonged to the Gallaway Trading Coster. Its next door neighbor was the Weeping Widow Inn.\nthumb|305x305px\nThe Trade Depot in Targos was a sizable single-floor building with its interior filled with shelves, displays, crates, barrels, cupboards, and chests. All the filled with somewhat organized goods that the Gallaway Trading Coster had available for sale, from weapons and armor to scrolls and cooking implements. A fanciful wardrobe stood on the opposite side from the main entrance, behind the counter. It was engraved with an image of a rearing lion and a cackling witch.\nGallaway Trading Coster was the main trading organization in the Ten Towns. It owned several warehouses in Targoss dock, and shipping crates found inside and in the Trade Depot bore trade seals of Bremen and Shaengarne Ford. The coaster exported potions of healing from Bryn Shander, weapons from Luskan, furs and pelts from Lonelywood, alcohol, iron rations, 10-foot poles, and ropes from other places.\nThe depo offered healing supplies such as bandages and cloth for sale. The arsenal available for purchase was varied, from mundane melee and ranged weapons to a selection of unique enchanted items.\nThe Gallaway Trading Coster was operated by the Gallaway family and brought to prominence by merchant Ilmus Gallaway of Easthaven. Over the years, the small caravan business grew to become a trading coster. By the early 14 century DR, Rawleigh Gallaway led the family, inhered from his father, Ilmus. In turn, Rawleighs daughter Deirdre Gallaway was put in charge of the companys operations in Targos, personally sent there by Ilmus so that the youth could prove herself. This time would become her biggest challenge as the trade was interrupted by attacks of the Legion of the Chimera, and the costers goods and lumber were confiscated by the Targos Guard to build the palisades and help protect Town. Jemeliah was one of the employees of the coster in Targos who was assigned the advisory job to Deirdre by her father as \"one last favor\" after serving the familys business for half of his life. Jemeliah did not approve of the town of Targos actions and thought that the massive debt they racked up with Deirdre would never be paid off. Deirdre had a reputation of being a brash flame-headed whelp, and she received little respect from Lord Ulbrec Dinnesmores men."
