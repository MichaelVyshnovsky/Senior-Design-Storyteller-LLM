The '''Watchful Knight''' was popular inn located in the town of [[Beliard]]. It earned its name from the centerpiece of its main hall, a [[helmed horror|suit of armor]] that sprang to life to guard the inn.

It was run by [[Arachar Calatharr (innkeeper)|Arachar Calatharr]] who, at his insistence was not related to the famous adventurer [[Arachar Calatharr (adventurer)|of the same name]].

==Structure==
The inn was built of logs and as such was deathly cold in the winter. It was warmed, as much as possible, by two chimneys located on either end.

==Interior==
The Watchful Knight comprised a vast central hall, atop which sat two additional floors of 16 guest rooms. Each of these rooms had an interior balcony that overlooked the inn's first floor.

Right in the center of the main hall was a suit of [[full plate]] armor that faced the inn's entrance. This was in fact a [[helmed horror]] that obeyed 

==History==
Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the helmed horror vanished from the Watchful Knight. The innkeeper followed suit a brief time later.
