The '''Tyrant's Hope Temple''' was a temple dedicated to [[Bane]] located in the village of [[Kzelter]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals Under the Black Gauntlet}}

==History==
The temple was built ''circa'' [[1369 DR]] over the ruins of an old temple to [[Oghma]], after the conquest of the village by the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]].

==Inhabitants==
The temple was inhabited by [[Neth Arrovar]], the resident cleric. Neth didn't spend all his nights there, having claimed the best home of the village as his residence instead.
