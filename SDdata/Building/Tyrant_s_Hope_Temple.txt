The Tyrants Hope Temple was a temple dedicated to Bane located in the village of Kzelter during the late 14 century DR.
The temple was built circa 1369 DR over the ruins of an old temple to Oghma, after the conquest of the village by the Knights of the Black Gauntlet.
The temple was inhabited by Neth Arrovar, the resident cleric. Neth didnt spend all his nights there, having claimed the best home of the village as his residence instead.
