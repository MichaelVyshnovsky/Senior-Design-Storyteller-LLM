'''The Waiting''' was a temple devoted to [[Tyr]] in [[Phlan]] and, as of [[1367 DR]], it was the only functional temple within the entire city.

==Location==
The Waiting was located near the center of Phlan.

==Description==
Beautiful white [[marble]] was used to construct the entire temple. A repeating balance scales motif decorated the stone. Consecrated burial vaults lay beneath the temple. These were available to followers of Tyr who died in service to their god. Due to an enchantment on the burial vaults, anyone buried here would never rise as an [[undead]].

==Activities==
The temple was run by [[Holondos Stimpiir]] and his six priests.
