The Deep Hunting Grounds was a temple dedicated to Malar, the Beastlord.
The temple was located within Undermountain beneath Mount Waterdeep in a subterranean forest called Wyllowwood.
Arbenita Darkwind led a congregation of sixty priests, warriors, and rogues who worshiped Malar.
Though most hunts took place within Undermountain, Malars faithful often spilled onto the streets of Waterdeep above ground with increasing frequency.
