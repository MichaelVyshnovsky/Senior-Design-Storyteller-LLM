        "mainbody": "The '''Cave of Tranquil Peace''' was a hall found within the [[Horseshoe Temple Oasis]] in the [[Quoya Desert]] of the [[Hordelands]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The Cave of Tranquil Peace was located in the far right side of upper galleries level of the temple. It was connected to the [[Halls of Life and Death]]. The Hall was quite long at {{SI|85|ft|long=yes}} with several small alcoves branching from its sides.",
        "History": "The hall was rarely used when the temple was fully operational as its purpose was to store the bones of abbots who died within the temple. Each set of bones was carefully placed within its own niche in the cave walls.",
        "Inhabitants": "Unlike the rest of the Temple, the hall remained empty as of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The occupying [[oni]] feared entering the Cave of Tranquil Peace because of the power they believed the dead abbots wielded. The oni painted protective charms to [[Li Pei]] in the other halls connecting here."
