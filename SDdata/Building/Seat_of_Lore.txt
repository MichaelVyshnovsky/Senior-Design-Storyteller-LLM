'''The Seat of Lore''' was a temple of [[Oghma]] in [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The temple was an old yet dignified house filled to the brim with [[tome]]s of knowledge, [[scroll]]s, [[map]]s, and reading tables. [[Driftglobe]]s were used to magically provide light within the temple, which was used as a center of historical study as well as the study of modern news and storytelling.

The temple was overseen by an energetic gnome by the name of [[Bransuldyn Mirrortor]], who had developed spells to record his thoughts and memories  from afar directly into blank books within the temple.

==Services==
The temple served as a study center, but focused on current and past histories rather than the usual genealogies, laws, treaties, and records that temples to Oghma usually focused on.

The temple did not pay for information, though it would pay handsomely for books, especially diaries and other tomes that most regular scholars would consider beneath them. 

Lesser clergy of the Seat would also copy out passages from the temple's writings, as well as copying magical tomes or scrolls, for a fee. The guests of the temple were forbidden from copying information from the temple's writings themselves.
