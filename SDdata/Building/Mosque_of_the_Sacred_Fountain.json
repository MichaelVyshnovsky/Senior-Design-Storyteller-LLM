        "mainbody": "The Mosque of the Sacred Fountain was a temple in Dihliz dedicated to the worship of Zann in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nThe mosque was situated in the north central area of the city. It sat across the main boulevard from the Ministry of Secrets.\nA large exalted fountain could be found within the central courtyard.\nMany supplicants came to the mosque in search of wisdom or divine inspiration for their treasure hunts. The priesthood greatly favored those who sought knowledge over riches.\nMany scrolls were held within the mosque, though the jungle humidity was a constant threat to their condition. Outsiders were allowed to read the scrolls, but the ruins they described were plundered long ago as of 1367 DR.\nCountless wasps and black hornets made their home in the fountain. A colony of giant mason wasps also lived within the mosque and were even taught to speak midani by the priests."
