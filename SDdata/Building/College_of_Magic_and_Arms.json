        "mainbody": "The '''College of Magic and Arms''' was the academy in [[Evereska]] where the city's citizens provided arcane and martial training for novice practitioners of [[the Art]] and warfare. Considered an institution of the highest [[elven]] standards, the college comprised two separate school within the city, the ''Academy of Arms'' and the ''Academy of Magic''.",
        "Location": "The dual academies were situated in the southeastern area of the city,",
        "Interior": "The Academy of Magic was believed to have displayed at least one trophy of a presumably deceased [[beholder]] within its halls.",
        "Services": "The college's Academy of Arms was sponsored by the [[Long Watch]] of Evereska, it held the reputation as producing some of the finest [[fighter]]s in all the Realms. The Academy of Magic was sponsored by the circles of [[Elven high mage|high mages]] that served as protectors and lore-keepers of Evereska. The safety and security enjoyed by the Evereskan people was a testament to the excellent quality of instruction offered within both institutions.\n\nIn nearly all cases, enrolment was exclusive to full-blooded elves. Only a select few [[half-elves]], or some members of the [[Harpers]] were granted admittance within the campuses.\n\nStudents of the Academy of Magic were expectedly taught how to cast and recognize [[arcane magic|arcane]] spells, and offered understanding of the history of magic on [[Toril]]. The rigors of daily life in the academy were believed by some to be rather solemnic and tedious.",
        "Defenses": "In times of need, the seniormost regiforms of each academy could be assembled in preparation for the city's defense.",
        "Inhabitants": "Esteemed instructors at the Academy of Arms included [[Aubric Nihmedu]], former [[bladesinger]] and Blademajor of the [[Swords of Evereska]]. Among the students that studied within its halls were [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], a commander within the [[Evereskan tomb guardian|Evereskan Tomb Guard]], [[Orem Arvaeyn]], a warrior of the [[Vale Guard]], and the noted adventurer and agent of the [[Harpers]], [[Arilyn Moonblade]]."
