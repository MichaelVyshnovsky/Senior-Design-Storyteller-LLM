Considered an institution of the highest elven standards, the college comprised two separate school within the city, the Academy of Arms and the Academy of Magic.\nThe dual academies were situated in the southeastern area of the city,\nThe Academy of Magic was believed to have displayed at least one trophy of a presumably deceased beholder within its halls.\nThe colleges Academy of Arms was sponsored by the Long Watch of Evereska, it held the reputation as producing some of the finest fighters in all the Realms. The Academy of Magic was sponsored by the circles of high mages that served as protectors and lore-keepers of Evereska. The safety and security enjoyed by the Evereskan people was a testament to the excellent quality of instruction offered within both institutions.\nIn nearly all cases, enrolment was exclusive to full-blooded elves. Only a select few half-elves, or some members of the Harpers were granted admittance within the campuses.\nStudents of the Academy of Magic were expectedly taught how to cast and recognize arcane spells, and offered understanding of the history of magic on Toril. The rigors of daily life in the academy were believed by some to be rather solemnic and tedious.\nIn times of need, the seniormost regiforms of each academy could be assembled in preparation for the citys defense.\nEsteemed instructors at the Academy of Arms included Aubric Nihmedu, former bladesinger and Blademajor of the Swords of Evereska. Among the students that studied within its halls were Galaeron Nihmedu, a commander within the Evereskan Tomb Guard, Orem Arvaeyn, a warrior of the Vale Guard, and the noted adventurer and agent of the Harpers, Arilyn Moonblade."
