        "mainbody": "he Great Shadows Mansion was a temple dedicated to Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.\nThe temple was located within the Valley of Lost Honor on top of the crypt where Eshowdow was disinterred, but its precise location was known only to Eshowdows most trusted servants.\nA massive step pyramid made completely of shadowstuff dominated the complex, but the pyramid and the entire temple were only visible to someone who underwent the summon shadow spirit incantation. The temple was also visible if viewed in the Shadowfell, where it really existed, or via a true seeing spell."
