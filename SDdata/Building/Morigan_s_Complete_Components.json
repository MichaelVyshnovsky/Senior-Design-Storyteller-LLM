        "mainbody": "origans Magical Components was a magic shop in Ravens Bluff, in the lateâ€“14 century DR, that was housed in the northern end of Kettle of Many Things.\nThis shop stood along Skulls Street, in the Swordpoint neighborhood of the citys Temple District.\nThis shop primarily dealt in material components for spells. While the owners found some success selling everyday components to local arcane spellcasters, stiff competition from Bendekars Mercantile forced the Morigans to refocus their wares to herbs and spices, which they sold to local restaurants and housekeepers.\nThe shop was run by a couple, Mijel and Jandra Morigan."
