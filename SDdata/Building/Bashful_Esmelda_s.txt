Bashful Esmeldas was a festhall and tavern in the Amnian city of Esmeltaran during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The festhall was built in northern Esmeltaran.
The place provided fairly good services at cheap prices. Many male customers were lured in by the illusion-enhanced signpost that showed the indistinct form of a woman bathing in a lake.
