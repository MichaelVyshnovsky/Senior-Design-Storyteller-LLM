'''Muldryn's Chainworks''' was a smithy and a [[chain]]-makers' workshop located in [[the Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The smithy stood facing a humble pathway that hugged the muddy bank of the [[Fire River]], connecting the riverside ends of the [[Deepaxe Way]] and [[Karen Court]] streets. [[Fruits & More]] grocer was located in the next building south.

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Anskaler Muldryn]] was a well-known for the quality chains produced by his workshop, manned by several sweaty and muscled blacksmiths. Anskaler's heavy-duty durable and dependable chains were in demand among [[fighter]]s who sought quality chained weapons and drovers in need of gate-lock chains. Muldryn-work was not known for its delicate and handsome looks.
