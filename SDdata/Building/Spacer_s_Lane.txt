The Spacers Lane was a rough-and-tumble tavern in Yeomans Loft, Netheril, in the 4 century before Dalereckoning.
The tavern was situated near the spelljamming docks in Helm Harbor.
The Lane was a favorite hangout for sailors and other unsavory visitors to the city. The establishment was run by an old captain known as Eleron Mistif.
Around , Karsus tried to steal all the magic from Mystryl and caused the downfall of Netheril. When this happened, four spelljamming vessels exploded and crashed into the docking district, killing thousands of people, and possible destroying the Spacers Lane tavern.
