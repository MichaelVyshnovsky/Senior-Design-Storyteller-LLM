The '''Spacer's Lane''' was a rough-and-tumble tavern in [[Yeoman's Loft]], [[Netheril]], in the 4{{th}} century before [[Dalereckoning]].

==Location==
The tavern was situated near the [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] docks in [[Helm Harbor]].

==Inhabitants==
The Lane was a favorite hangout for sailors and other unsavory visitors to the city. The establishment was run by an old captain known as [[Eleron Mistif]].

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}, [[Karsus]] tried to steal all the magic from [[Mystryl]] and caused the downfall of Netheril. When this happened, four spelljamming vessels exploded and crashed into the docking district, killing thousands of people, and possible destroying the Spacer's Lane tavern.
