        "Structure": "The tower was surrounded by a stone wall. Within the wall was a garden encircling the base of the tower that filled the air with sweet scents. The tower had four doors at its base, one on each side.",
        "Interior": "A single circular stairway wound upward from the bottom floor.\n\nA small windowless chamber was located at the top of the stairway. An intricate pattern lined the floor of this room.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "The pattern lining the floor on the tower's highest level was rumored to be magical, capable of instantly transporting anyone who stood upon it to whichever location they pictured in their mind.",
        "Inhabitants": "Four [[guardian genie]]s stood before the doorways on the bottom floor of the tower, preventing anyone from ascending the stairway unless they correctly answered a question. The genies reacted aggressively to any visitor who did not immediately leave the tower if they failed to answer the question."
