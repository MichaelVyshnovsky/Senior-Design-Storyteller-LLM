An intricate pattern lined the floor of this room.\nThe pattern lining the floor on the towers highest level was rumored to be magical, capable of instantly transporting anyone who stood upon it to whichever location they pictured in their mind.\nFour guardian genies stood before the doorways on the bottom floor of the tower, preventing anyone from ascending the stairway unless they correctly answered a question. The genies reacted aggressively to any visitor who did not immediately leave the tower if they failed to answer the question."
