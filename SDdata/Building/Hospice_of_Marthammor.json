It was led by Observer [[Kerrilla Gemstar]], who provided healing and lodging for her guests, though not without cost.",

        "Services": {
            "Duties": "Along with the worshipers of [[Lathander]] from [[the Morning Watchtower]], Observer Gemstar and her clergy within the hospice kept a keen eye on activity around the [[Ironhand Mines]]. Within these old depths was an entrance to the [[Underdark]], and a temple of [[Shar]] known as the [[Well of Darkness]]."
