        "mainbody": "The Hospice of Marthammor was a sanctuary for travelers run by dwarven servants of the dwarf deity Marthammor Duin, in the Old Delzoun region of Luruar in the late 14 century DR. It was led by Observer Kerrilla Gemstar, who provided healing and lodging for her guests, though not without cost. \nThe church was located about two miles (3.2 km) northwest of the town of Deadsnows, along the Deadsnows Track. \nThe Hospice regularly had five to ten guests a night, but could provide lodging for up to twenty. In the summer days during the regions gold rush, the hospice was almost always full. \nVisitors could stay for one night with a meal of hard bread and cheese for free, but after that they were required to pay 2 sp a night, or 3 sp if they also wanted a meal. Most were turned out after a tenday, unless they were dwarves or friends of Observer Kerrilla.\nHealing services were granted to those who were in need, though Kerrilla would ask for service in return. Often this included assisting the town of Deadsnows with service in their local militia or assisting with any problems the town may have.\nAlong with the worshipers of Lathander from the Morning Watchtower, Observer Gemstar and her clergy within the hospice kept a keen eye on activity around the Ironhand Mines. Within these old depths was an entrance to the Underdark, and a temple of Shar known as the Well of Darkness."
