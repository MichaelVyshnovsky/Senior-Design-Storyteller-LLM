The Mosque of Blistering Atonement was located in the City of Brass in 1367 DR.
This mosque was found in the Furnace ward of the city.
As a dedicated shrine to Imix, a terrifying archomental of fire, the entire building was covered with corroded copper, creating a disquieting scene.
Since Imix was a primordial prince of sinister creatures of fire, many efreeti and their legions revered him.
