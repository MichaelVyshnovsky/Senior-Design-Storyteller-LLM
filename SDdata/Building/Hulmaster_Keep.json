It contained a great banquet hall, a barracks, and private chambers for the Hulmasters and their guests.\nDaggergard served as a barracks for Hulburgs forces. In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, only a dozen soldiers manned the keep.\nAs the ancestral home of the Hulmaster family, the keep had seen and survived many sieges of Hulburg over the centuries. Following the near complete destruction of the city in the , by the forces of Zhentil Keep, it was the only building that showed any real signs of life in the ruins. It continued to be the home of the Hulmasters over the next few decades despite their flagging fortunes. By the , the master of the keep was Argyl Hulmaster, who would begrudgingly provide hospitality to travelers, but often with the ulterior motive of trying to pressure the most attractive or wealthiest of his guests into marrying one of his children.\nBy the , one of Argyls sons, Angar Hulmaster, was lord of the keep. The family fortune had continued to wane and only a few servants remained in the keep. At this time, a contingent of the Red Plumes mercenaries from Hillsfar, led by captains Hekman Odelmor and Kindon Marstel, took over Hulburg, and dozens of their troops occupied the barracks and consumed the keeps supplies.\nAngar would go on to build Griffonwatch, which would become the new home of the Hulmaster family. Hulmaster Keep came to be known exclusively by its alternative name, Daggergard, and was used only as a barracks and defensive structure as of the late 15 century DR."
