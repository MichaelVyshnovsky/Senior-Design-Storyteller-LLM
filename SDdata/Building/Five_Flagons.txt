The '''Five Flagons Inn''' was a three-floored inn in the [[Guards District (Athkatla)|Guards District]] of [[Athkatla]] that was known for its entertainment. It was mainly occupied by wealthy customers.

==Interior==
The inn had three floors, although the top floor and cellar floor were a lot larger than the serving room. The entrance led to the service room, which had a typical bar and sold a variety of beverages. The bar room joined onto [[Uda]]'s kitchen, which contained several counters and two cooking stoves.

The cellar floor had many rooms. The entryway held a ticket booth, where customers could purchase tickets for the theater. The main room held a large stage, with many props such as a musical [[harp]]. Behind the stage was the actor's prep room, which contained dressers and make-up stands. The final room was a fairly big storage area, and was connected to both the theater and prep room.

The top floor was very large, and could accommodate many patrons. The master bedroom contained a luxury bed, living area and a grand piano. Its walls were adorned with many expensive paintings. The intermediate room contained two large canvassed wagons, which had been turned into decorations. It also contained a pipe organ and storage boxes. As well as numerous bedrooms, there was a couple of dining areas.

==Services==
The inn had a standard bar, manned by the enthusiastic [[halfling]] [[Samuel Thunderburp]]. He claimed that they had every beverage in [[Faer√ªn]], but they actually had quite a limited selection. The tavern rented out rooms of all standards, and accommodated for everyone, from peasants to nobles.

The main attraction was the underground theater, where three to four actors would perform for customers, particularly wealthy nobles.
