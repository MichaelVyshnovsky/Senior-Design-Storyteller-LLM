        "mainbody": "arwatch Tower was one of the major torchtowers of Waterdeeps Trollwall, located in the citys North Ward.Every tower connected to the Trollwall falls under the designation of \"torchtower.\"The sourcebook City System states that all torchtowers with names are \"major towers\".\nThis tower was located at the end of Tower March, just north of Watch Alley.\nFarwatch Tower stood five stories tall and was directly connected to the Trollwall that bounded the city and separated North Ward from the Field Ward.\nBeing a torchtower, Farwatch Tower had all the features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes. Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.\nBehind an open doorway in the towers southeastern wall, was a tall yet tiny bare sentry post with walls several feet thick, that was regularly monitored by the City Watch. This was because the sentry post was both haunted and contained a secret portal to Maldiglasâ€™s Refuge. Despite their best efforts, it was often utilized by conspirators, lovers, and beggars seeking shelter.\nLike all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.\nFarwatch Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch."
