        "mainbody": "Miths Carved Whimsies and Woodcuts was a specialty woodshop in Sundabar that belonged to the extremely skilled, though somewhat child-like, woodcarver Mith Tlalant. \nMith reveled in delighting the children with small, wooden carvings of animals, monsters and even personalities of Faer√ªn. \nDespite their innocent nature, Miths hand-size crafts were popular enough to be found in far away lands such as Kara-Tur and Maztica. They sold for a fairly steep price of 700 gold pieces, but foreign collectors were willing to repurchase them for thousands of gold pieces."
