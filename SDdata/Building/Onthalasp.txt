Onthalasp was a temple to Umberlee, the Sea Queen, clinging to the tiny Onthalaspan Isle in the northern part of Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords around the 11 to early 13 centuries DR.
It was the home of High Trident Arthaeuil Nrensam, who wrote Words on a Wave in the Year of the Roaring Tempest, 1016 DR.
In the Year of the Black Buck, 1226 DR, during a huge storm called Umberlees Displeasure, both Onthalasp and its isle completely disappeared.
