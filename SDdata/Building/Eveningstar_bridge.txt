The '''Eveningstar bridge''' was a large stone bridge in the [[Cormyr]]ean town of [[Eveningstar]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|They say that King Azoun spent a fortune on this bridge, back in the day.
|[[Purple Dragon knight]]The most recent and prominent Azoun at the time would be Azoun V.

The bridge crossed the [[Starwater River]] with the eastâ€“west [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] on the east side of Eveningstar leading towards [[Arabel]].

==Structure==
The great stone bridge had three arches and two gatehouses atop it.

==History==
{{Quote
|It took some doing, but we managed to secure both sides of the bridge.

The bridge was built during the reign of King [[Azoun V]] at great expense, connecting the High Road across the Starwater and replacing the older, smaller bridge.

During the [[Darkening]] of the mid-1480s [[DR]], the village [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar|came under attack]] by [[drow]] forces, though they focused on the southern and western sides of the village and not the bridge. Not long after, a company of [[orc]]s from the [[Storm Horns]] (ostensibly controlled by Archwizard [[Amskar]] of [[Thultanthar]]) suddenly raided Eveningstar as well, briefly overwhelming the eastern defenses of the bridge before the garrisoned [[Purple Dragons]] pushed them back and secured both ends. They then reinforced the eastern barricades while sending forces into the Storm Horns to determine the source of the attack.
