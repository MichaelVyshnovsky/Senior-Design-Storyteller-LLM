The '''Flaming Goblet''' was an underground tavern found in the city of [[Myth Drannor]] during the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It was situated in eastern part of Myth Drannor's [[Myth Drannor/Kerradunath|Kerradunath]], where the [[Street of Song]] intersected with the [[Street of the Evening Star]].

==Structure==
The Goblet was built beneath the street-level of the city, descending two stories into a burrow structure.

==Services==
Catering to the young and rowdy tavern-goers of Myth Drannor, the halls of the Goblet were amess with its namesake ''glamour-goblets'': magically enhanced vessels that held illuminating liquid light that could either be carried like a torch or consumed by the patron. When drunk, the goblet caused the drinker to glow with an inner radiance for a short while.
