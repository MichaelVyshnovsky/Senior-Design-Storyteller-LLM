The Cage was a special prison located within the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Cage was completely enclosed by walls of force. Powerful enchantments were in place to ensure that spellcasting, or the use of magical abilities, was not possible within the Cage.
This enchanted prison was used to house dangerous mages, priests, and genies. Due to the powerful enchantments warding the Cage, the Grand Caliph could safely question anyone held within. Still, he was always accompanied by an escort of the Dutiful, a shair, and several genies.
