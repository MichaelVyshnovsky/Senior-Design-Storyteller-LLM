        "mainbody": "The '''Tomb of the Nine Gods''' was the sprawling dungeon complex located under the ruined city of [[Omu]] in [[Chult]] that housed the remains of the city's [[Primal_spirit#The_Nine_Trickster_Gods_of_Omu|nine trickster gods]]. It was built by the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] with the specific purpose to kill any intruders that dared venture within. The [[soul]]s of these unfortunate dead were used to power the ''[[Soulmonger]]'', a horrifying machine that spawned the ''[[death curse]]'' or [[Toril]] which would give birth to a new [[god]] of death.\n\n{{Quote|I'm alive! Truly alive, not some undead creature.

        "Location": "The Tomb of the Nine Gods was found within the city of Omu,\n\nJust outside the Tomb was a [[Black obelisk|mysterious obelisk]] that emanated a strong aura of [[abjuration]] magic and held a [[fiend]]ish presence within. Beneath the overgrowth that covered it's façade was inscribed a warning from Acererak himself.",
        "Structure": {
            "Exterior": "Three openings were found along the base of the rocky cliff within which the Tomb of the Nine Gods was built. One passageway faced east and two others opened to the north. The east-facing passage opened to the 'Gallery of Tricksters', which housed statues of the nine trickster gods. The eastern of the two north-facing openings was a trapped, false entrance to the Tomb; the western of the two gave way to the true entrance, connecting to the Tomb of the Nine God's [[Tomb of the Nine Gods#Rotten Halls|first level]].",
            "Underground": "[[File:Skeleton keys ToA.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''These skeletons were the key to unlocking the Tomb's final puzzle.'']]\nThe Tomb of the Nine Gods was carved into natural stone at the base of and beneath a rocky cliff in the Chultan jungle, descending six floors beneath ground level. Most of the Tomb's levels comprised separate chambers, linked by narrow, [[trap]]-lined passageways, cramped crawlspaces, and hidden stone doors that grinded in and out of place.\n\nThe first four levels of the Tomb housed the individual resting places of the nine trickster gods. Interspersed amidst them were horrific and often creative machines of death, a means by which Acererak could kill mortals and harvest their souls. The chambers on each of these floors were constructed around a large square cavity within which was a grand staircase. Acererak offered a second warning on a plaque above these stairs.\n\nThe fifth floor comprised a vast undersea waterway that powered colossal-sized machinery, which in turn powered Acererak's horrific, soul-devouring device."

            "Atmosphere": "The Tomb of the Nine Gods was a foreboding and grim locale, that inspired absolute terror in anyone that stepped foot inside.\n\nThe twisted and often desecrated remains of slain adventurers and treasure-seekers were scattered throughout the Tomb.",
            "Supernatural Effects": "Magic did not function within the Tomb of the Nine Gods as it otherwise would. Any form of translocation magic failed outright, or deposited the caster and others into a [[Tomb of the Nine Gods#Chambers of Horrors|corpse-filled chamber]].

        "Activities": "While the Tomb's original purpose was merely to house the Nine Trickster Gods, Acererak gained new intention for his creation. After his travels led him to an atropal―a stllborn god that languished as a mass of [[undead]] flesh―Acereak came to believe he could give birth to a new [[Toril]]lian god of death. The Tomb would attract adventurers from across the Realms, slay them with sickening efficiency, and Acererak would feed their souls to the atropal by means of the ''[[Soulmonger]]''.\n\nIn order to lure those greedy and power-hungry adventurers within, Acererak placed within the Tomb many powerful [[magic]]al items, along with legendary treasures from across the Realms. Notable among these were the ''[[Black Opal Crown]]'', the ''[[Eye of Zaltec]]'', the ''[[Navel of the Moon]]'', and the ''[[Skull Chalice of Ch'gakare]]''.",
        "Defenses": "[[File:Tomb_Guardian.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[tomb guardian]]s served as the...guardians of the Tomb of the Nine Gods.]]\nFor a time, the area around the Tomb and its entrance were guarded by [[Ras Nsi]] and his fellow [[yuan-ti]] cultists of [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]. Acererak manipulated the yuan-ti leader, who had been afflicted by the [[death curse]].\n\nThe passageways within the Tomb were patrolled by tomb guardians, armored flesh golems that patrolled the Tomb and reset triggered traps. They were forged from the corpses of slain adventurers by the undead tomb dwarves.",
        "History": "After the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] murdered the nine gods of Omu, he enslaved the city's inhabitants and forced them to build the Tomb of the Nine Gods, employing a number of them as architects and designers for the tomb's traps. When construction of the Tomb was complete, he forced the Omuan slaves into its traps to ensure the deadliness of their creations.\n\nWhile traveling across the [[multiverse]], Acererak came upon the atropal he thought to reawaken, and nestled it within the heart of the Tomb.\n\nSome time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a band of adventurers traveling through Omu came across the Tomb of the Nine Gods and willing chose to venture inside. During their expedition, several of these adventurers were inhabited by the spirits of the nine trickster gods, who imposed upon them their own personal flaws, while granting them significant supernatural power.\n\nAcererak was not deterred after his plot was thwarted and the Tomb of the Nine Gods destroyed. He began to gather new minions to repopulate his favored dungeon.\n\nSome years later, two different groups delved into the Tomb of the Nine Gods in search of a [[tome]] of great importance. The [[Thayan knight]] [[Seddikai Sharpblade]] and their cohorts entered into the Tomb in search of the book entitled ''[[The Death of the Mind]]'', followed soon after by [[Zehira Deryan]] and her allies, who sought the book for a [[sage]] named [[Alsbith]]. Zehira and her companions were successful in its recovery and the agents of the [[Red Wizards]] were thwarted in their mission.{{Cite adventurers league/Thimblerigging|14}}{{Cite adventurers league/Thimblerigging|18-19}} \n\n[[File:Bearded_green_devil.jpg|thumb|center|700px|''The face of the bearded green [[devil]] pervaded the Tomb of the Nine Gods' walls.'']]",

Withers oversaw the tomb dwarves' operations and commanded a small army of crawling claws to carry out repairs and maintenance throughout the Tomb.",
