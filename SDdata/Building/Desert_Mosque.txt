The Desert Mosque, also called the Oasis of the Desert Mosque, was a religious structure in Zakhara where Haku, the Zakharan god of freedom, was worshiped.
The Desert Mosque was located about halfway between the Pit of the Ghuls and the Sea of Caravans in the northern reaches of the High Desert.
The Desert Mosque was a massive dome constructed of volcanic rock. It was mostly buried in the sand but faced Huzuz, the City of Delights.
The Dome Dancers worshiped Haku at this mosque.
The location of the Desert Mosque was the site where the first desert dweller, Yusef al-Nasr, received enlightenment.
The Desert Mosque was run by a man named Angaloran.
A different clan from the House of Nasr protected the Mosque for a year at a time.
