        "mainbody": "The Watchful Knight was popular inn located in the town of Beliard. It earned its name from the centerpiece of its main hall, a suit of armor that sprang to life to guard the inn.\nIt was run by Arachar Calatharr who, at his insistence was not related to the famous adventurer of the same name.\nThe inn was built of logs and as such was deathly cold in the winter. It was warmed, as much as possible, by two chimneys located on either end.\nThe Watchful Knight comprised a vast central hall, atop which sat two additional floors of 16 guest rooms. Each of these rooms had an interior balcony that overlooked the inns first floor.\nRight in the center of the main hall was a suit of full plate armor that faced the inns entrance. This was in fact a helmed horror that obeyed \nSome time before the , the helmed horror vanished from the Watchful Knight. The innkeeper followed suit a brief time later."
