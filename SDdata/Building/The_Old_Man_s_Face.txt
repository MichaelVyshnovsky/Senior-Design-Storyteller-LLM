The '''Old Man's Face''' was a rundown [[inn]] found in [[Tyrluk]] along the [[High Road]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
A carved wooden sign of a cheerful old man hung outside of the inn's entrance.

==Activities==
Despite the welcoming sign, the inn was not a place where strangers were greeted with open arms. Most of the patrons were locals who ate the inn's simple fare and drank the bad beer.

The local patrol of [[Purple Dragons]] was the only source of outside regular paying customers. The locals amused themselves with guessing which of the male soldiers would marry one of the female soldiers.
