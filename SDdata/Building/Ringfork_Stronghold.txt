The '''Ringfork Stronghold''' was an [[orc]]ish fortification in the [[Trielta Hills]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Ringfork Stronghold was ruled by [[Heradd|Lord Heradd]], who was believed to have had his sights on usurping leadership of the two other orcish communities of the Trielta Hills. The fort was approached by an agent of the [[Cult of the Absolute]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, who sought to recruit Lord Heradd's orcs into the cult's army. Agent [[Mhoss]], the first envoy, was dismembered by Lord Heradd's guardâ€”an act that led to the cult's re-evaluation of their strategy. Sir [[Yax]] of [[Scornubel]] was decided to be the next envoy as he was familiar with orcish traditions and culture. Yax's strategy was to arrive accompanied by two [[ogre]]s and issue a personal challenge to Lord Heradd for the killing of Agent Mhoss. Yax then would have to defeat the orcish lord, force him to swear allegiance to [[the Absolute]], and, in exchange, the cult would offer Lord Heradd an alliance in conquering the other two orcish communities of the Trielta Hills.
