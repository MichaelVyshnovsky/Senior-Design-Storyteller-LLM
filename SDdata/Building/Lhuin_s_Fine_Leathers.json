        "mainbody": "'''Lhuin's Fine Leathers''' was a tannery and leather shop found in [[Ashabenford]] in the late 1300s [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}} The shop's proprietor, the expert leatherworker [[Lhando Lhuin]], made and sold leather belts, armor, weather cloaks, wide-brim hats, and tack and saddles for [[horse]]s. He also offered leather gloves and boots for sale, but refused to craft them as he felt he did not possess the required skill. His prices were very reasonable, with items being offered at a 10% discount from other stores.\n\nThe shop was particularly aromatic, and the scent from the tannery spread at least as far as [[The Six Shields]] rooming house."
