        "mainbody": "huins Fine Leathers was a tannery and leather shop found in Ashabenford in the late 1300s DR. The shops proprietor, the expert leatherworker Lhando Lhuin, made and sold leather belts, armor, weather cloaks, wide-brim hats, and tack and saddles for horses. He also offered leather gloves and boots for sale, but refused to craft them as he felt he did not possess the required skill. His prices were very reasonable, with items being offered at a 10% discount from other stores.\nThe shop was particularly aromatic, and the scent from the tannery spread at least as far as The Six Shields rooming house."
