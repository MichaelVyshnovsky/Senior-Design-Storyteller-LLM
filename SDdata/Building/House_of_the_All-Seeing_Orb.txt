The House of the All-Seeing Orb was a temple devoted to Savras located within the city of Tashluta. It was considered one of the premiere places in Faerûn dedicated to the study of divination.
The temple was a large sprawling complex, with beauteous courtyards and magnificent buildings. Several of its exquisitely-decorated structures were adorned with the all-seeing eye of Savras.
The temple complex housed a permanent teleportation circle that could be access from various locations across the Realms.
The House of the All-Seeing Orb housed the College of Divination, the Celestial Observatory, and the Library of Ultimate Truth. Many divination spells and enchanted scrying devices found their origins within the temple.
The central structure of the temple-complex contained a portal that linked it with another temple of Savras, contained within its own demiplane.
The temple was the preeminent house of worship for Savras throughout the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
The temple was run by the Farseer who was considered to be one of the most skilled diviners throughout Faerûn. Over one thousand scholars lived within the temple.
* Xemru Thaal, High Priest of Savras within the temple.
* Shir Endellion, a high-ranking priest of the temple.
* Valin Sarnaster, the famed oracle of Savras who achieved a form of immortality through undeath.
