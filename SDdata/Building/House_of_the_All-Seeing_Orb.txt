The '''House of the All-Seeing Orb''' was a temple devoted to [[Savras]] located within the city of [[Tashluta]]. It was considered one of the premiere places in [[Faerûn]] dedicated to the study of [[divination]].

==Structure==
The temple was a large sprawling complex, with beauteous courtyards and magnificent buildings. Several of its exquisitely-decorated structures were adorned with the all-seeing eye of Savras.

The temple complex housed a permanent ''[[teleportation circle]]'' that could be access from various locations across the Realms.

==Activities==
The House of the All-Seeing Orb housed the [[College of Divination]], the [[Celestial Observatory]], and the [[Library of Ultimate Truth]]. Many [[divination]] [[spell]]s and enchanted scrying devices found their origins within the temple.

The central structure of the temple-complex contained a ''[[portal]]'' that linked it with another [[Tomb of Valin Sarnaster|temple of Savras, contained within its own demiplane]].

==History==
The temple was the preeminent house of worship for Savras throughout the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
The temple was run by the [[Farseer]] who was considered to be one of the most skilled [[diviner]]s throughout Faerûn. Over one thousand scholars lived within the temple.

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Xemru Thaal]], High Priest of Savras within the temple.
* [[Shir Endellion]], a high-ranking priest of the temple.
* [[Valin Sarnaster]], the famed oracle of Savras who achieved a form of immortality through [[undeath]].
