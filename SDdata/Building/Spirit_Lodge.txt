Spirit Lodge was a temporary lodging for green elves in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet.
The lodge was a long building surrounded by trees. It was grown from different types of trees and painted externally with elven designs.
At the lodge, it was agreed that the rivalries between these elves would be set aside while staying at the lodge, and it was almost never unoccupied.
