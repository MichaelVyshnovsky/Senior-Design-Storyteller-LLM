        "mainbody": "The Dog and Bone was an infamous drinking establishment in the village of Ravilars Cloak, Turmish, in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nLocated in a mining town where passions ran hot, the Dog and Bone was popular for its low prices. Bar brawls were the most popular local pastime and the Dog and Bone often provided. A pile of drunken commoners pushing their way out of the Dog and Bone and pummeling each other on the street in front of the watering hole was a common sight in Ravilars Cloak."
