        "mainbody": "The '''Brown Horse''' was a [[tavern]] in [[Thundertree]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The tavern was located to the northwest of the village, close to its entrance.",
        "Structure": "Its exterior was well-kept, even after the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in [[1451 DR]]. The intact, stony wall had a sign close to the entry door of a horse holding a tankard of ale.\n\nThe building was split into two sections: its eastern side housed the common room, whilst its western side housed the brewing canisters and kitchen.",
        "Services": "The Brown Horse was well known for it brilliant [[ale]], and the tavern itself smelled of brewer's [[yeast]].",
        "History": "After the eruption, when the owners had been driven out or killed, [[ash zombie]]s took residence in the tavernâ€”some even gathered under the bar."
