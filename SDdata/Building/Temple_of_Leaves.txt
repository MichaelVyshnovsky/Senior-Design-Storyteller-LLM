The Temple of Leaves was a holy site dedicated to the head of the elven pantheon, Corellon Larethian, located in the outpost of New Sharandar.
Located within its walls was a shrine formed out of a single living hedge. It was carefully shaped in a manner to hold and support the temples holy documents and icons.
Located beneath the priests quarters in the temple was a subterranean cellar that housed a secret shrine to Asmodeus, archdevil and ruler of the Nine Hells.
While the priests of the Temple of Leaves devoted themselves to the worship of Corellon, they allowed for others to practice nearly any other faith they wished.
The Temple of Leaves priests were considered as leaders among the community of Iliyanbruen elves of New Sharandar. They spent much of their time praying that their fellows would enjoy much success in their reclamation of the ancient ruins of fallen Illefarn.
The priests leader, Emrae Firesky was a fervent supporter of Olirien Mistcrown, and his faction of elves that advocated for violence against the people of Neverwinter and the surrounding area.
