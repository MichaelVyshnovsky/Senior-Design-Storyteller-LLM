The Hall of the Port was a meeting place for the sea captains of of Urmlaspyr in 1358 DR.
The Hall of the Port was located directly north of Urmlaspyr Keep in the southeast region of the city.
The captains would assemble to discuss tariffs and rules of the port. The Hamarch officially chaired these meetings, but held little real power over the captains unless he was prepared to have them arrested and seize their ships, exile them from the city, or hold their ship and cargo for a time.
