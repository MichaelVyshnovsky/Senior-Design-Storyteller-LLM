        "mainbody": "The Furnitures Fate was a tavern in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr circa 1369 DR owned by Boffo Arglebargle Cosgrove Bullwubble II.\nThe tavern was popular with adventurers operating out of Thunderstone, and thus it was a good spot to hear their stories.\nAs the name suggested, brawls were common, especially those that resulted in broken furniture. The signboard above the door even depicted a chair being broken over a persons head.\nTavernkeeper Boffo, being an eccentric prankster, was usually at the center of these brawls. When he wasnt, he usually had his bouncer Stig lift him up and hurl the gnome into the fray."
