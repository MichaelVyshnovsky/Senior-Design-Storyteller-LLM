        "mainbody": "he Grand Souk, meaning \"grand market\", was the largest and most impressive marketplace in Port Nyanzaru, Chult. It was located in the citys Merchants Ward. \nThe Grand Souk was a covered market that encompassed vast rows of small shops, stands, stalls, and tents. Its colorful awnings kept out both the rain and sun, but also served to keep in the heat and smells of the marketplace.\nThe market was a sensory overload of cacophonous sounds, bright colors, and exotic odors. It was often crowded, with shoppers jostling and pressing against each other. The noise was compounded by the presence of many tabaxi minstrels and street performers who sang, danced, and juggled for the occasional copper piece. The smells of spices mixed with that of the people and their dinosaurs to become an assault on the senses.\nJust about anything could be found for purchase at the Grand Souk, and if not, some merchants would be happy to procure it for the right price. While one could easily find things like dinosaur meat, jungle herb medicines, spices, and tropical fruits, This included various natural treasures of the jungles&mdashsuch as colorful feathers, dinosaur claws and skulls, iron, ivory, tiger pelts, and timber\nThe market opened before dawn and stayed open until dusk.\n* Weave of Life, a large stand selling garments, tourism information, and kitschy handcrafts. The stores proprietor, Klevin VanSheran, was in truth an agent for the Lords Alliance. \n* A tea house sat just outside the market.\nNumerous guards kept the crowds moving and patrolled the Grand Souk on the lookout for pickpockets and urchins.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the Grand Souk dwarfed the other major marketplaces in the city, notably the Jewel Market and the Red Bazaar. Merchants from all across the Sword Coast were drawn to the market to trade for exotic Chultan goods."
