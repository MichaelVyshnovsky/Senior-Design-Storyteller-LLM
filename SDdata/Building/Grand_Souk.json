The noise was compounded by the presence of many [[tabaxi]] [[minstrel]]s and street performers who sang, danced, and juggled for the occasional [[copper piece]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|4}} The smells of [[spice]]s mixed with that of the people and their dinosaurs to become an assault on the senses."
