The Invisible College was a place of study for djinni sorcerers within the Citadel of Ice and Steel.
Layer upon layer of illusions were constantly changing within and around the College, leading most sages to agree that it did not really exist.
The vast majority of djinni sorcerers, along with their bound deceiver genies, called the Invisible College home.
