        "mainbody": "he Temple of Sharess in Bezantur was a decadent and debauched place of worship dedicated to Sharess.\nThe temple was located in northern-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\" in Thay. Appropriately, it was adjacent to other temples, most immediately Loviatars Manor across the street to the south and the House of Iyachtu Xvim across the street to the east.\nThe main temple was an octagonal structure with a large dome. Several smaller hexagonal shrines radiated from this central building.\nThe temple hosted daily sermons about the importance of enjoying life to the fullest, and advocated for worldly pleasure and excess. Each tenday, the temple hosted a \"High Worship\" ceremony which was just a massive party at which revelers overate, overdrank, and overindulged in all manner of pleasures of the flesh.\nWorship of Sharess was somewhat new in Bezantur as of the  mid-to-late 14 century DR, and the temple stood out as one of the few dedicated to a chaotic good deity in the city. However, two factors made her worship suitable to the citys inhabitants her association with Shar and the fact that Bezantur was a decadent city, thus the hedonism preached at the temple strongly resonated with many residents. As of the , the temple was one of the most popular and fastest growing congregations in the city, and was stealing popularity away from the worship of both Loviatar and Sune. The Temple of Sune even retaliated by spreading rumors that Sharesss congregation was uncivilized and crude.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the temple was run by high priest Haldran and his acolytes."
