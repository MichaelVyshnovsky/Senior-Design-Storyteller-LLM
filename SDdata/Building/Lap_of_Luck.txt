The Lap of Luck was a shrine of Tymora in Scardale Town, and the only religious building that survived the Second inter-dale war in 1356 DR.
During the occupation of the city, the shrine was run by the cheerful and popular halfling priestess Gelli Parabuck. Despite her favorable reputation, many Scardalesman felt the Goddess of Luck had abandoned their land.
