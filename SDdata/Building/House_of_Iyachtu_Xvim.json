        "mainbody": "The '''House of Iyachtu Xvim''' was a temple dedicated to [[Iyachtu Xvim]] in the [[Thay]]an city of [[Bezantur]], the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\"",
        "Location": "The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur and was adjacent to the [[Temple of Sharess (Bezantur)|Temple of Sharess]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was one of the largest in Bezantur. It comprised a grand central hall with two long wings containing shrines as well as sleeping, dining, and storage facilities for the temple's residents. A dozen smaller buildings also occupied the temple grounds, some of which served as housing for higher-ranked [[priest]]s while others hosted various [[church of Iyachtu Xvim|Xvimlar]] ceremonies.",
        "Activities": "The House's congregation was one of the most enthusiastic in the city, and was known to brawl in the streets with followers of [[Cyric]] from the nearby [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]].\n\nXvim himself was known to visit the temple and lead ceremonies.",
        "History": "The House of Iyachtu Xvim was constructed in the late 1360s [[DR]] as part of a push to dedicate temples to Xvim throughout Thay. The House was immediately somewhat unique among temples to Xvim as most of his places of worship were underground and/or former temples to [[Bane]].\n\nWith the opening of the temple, tensions with the House of Cyric swiftly escalated as it was Xvim's aspiration to usurp Cyric's divine [[portfolio]]. The two temples engaged in acts of assassination and [[magical]] assaults against each other.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was [[Dienje Xavarri]], a fanatic who was also widely considered second only to Xvim himself as the head of Xvim's church in Thay.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "As [[baneguard]]s were popular servants at Xvim's Thayan temples, it was likely that the House of Iyachtu Xvim was involved in creating and using them."
