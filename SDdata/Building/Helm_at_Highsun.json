        "Interior": "{{quote|No one bothers you at the Helm.|}}\nThe tavern was shadowy and quiet. Most customers were caravan guards, adventurers, retired people, merchants looking for relaxation, and people who just wanted to be alone.",
        "Staff": "The motto of the Helm at Highsun was enforced by a silent, attentive, and menacing [[helmed horror]] that was under the mental control of Indaglol. The horror was known as [[Araldyk]], and served as waiter, usher, bouncer, and sometimes a cloak rack."
