        "mainbody": "he Helm at Highsun was a tavern in the town of Red Larch owned by a mage named Yather Indaglol around 1367 DR.\nThe tavern was shadowy and quiet. Most customers were caravan guards, adventurers, retired people, merchants looking for relaxation, and people who just wanted to be alone.\nThe motto of the Helm at Highsun was enforced by a silent, attentive, and menacing helmed horror that was under the mental control of Indaglol. The horror was known as Araldyk, and served as waiter, usher, bouncer, and sometimes a cloak rack."
