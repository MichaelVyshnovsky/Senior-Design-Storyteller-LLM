The Mermaids Arms was a pricey and busy tavern, inn, and festhall in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep, ran by Calathia Frost circa midâ€“14 century DR. It was still a fairly new establishment circa 1363 DR. 
This establishment was located halfway along Dock Street.
The Mermaids Arms was a bright and large establishment, standing three stories tall. The Arms consisted of a series of smaller lounges and dining halls, richly decorated with posh blue tapestries that reminded its patrons of the sea.
The Mermaids Arms was known for its food, atmosphere, and companionship. Most clients came there to have a good meal or a strong drink, sometimes alone, more often in the company of a handsome host or a beautiful hostess. The Arms also offered rooms for the night for travelers or folk needing company for the night. By the late 14 century DR, the good reputation of the festhall attracted single Waterdhavians looking for love and companionship, be it with a fellow customer or a hired host.
The tavern was often used by traveling merchants who discussed business over dinner, ventured out into the city for drinks to complete the transaction, and later in the evening, came back to the Arms for their warm bed and company.
The Mermaids Arms charged its clients separately for rooms, food, libations, and companionship, which often came up to a significant expense.
The Mermaids Armss proprietor was Calathia Frost in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. She was known to the regulars for her deep sultry voice and quiet business-like demeanor.
Tia, a server at the Arms in the late 14 century DR, was kidnapped by a tribe of kobolds in 1370 DR and held hostage for several months in Undermountain.
