==Location==
The commons dominated the southeast corner of Daggerford south of the [[Ducal Castle]].

==Activities==
This area was intentionally kept clear to use as an emergency pasture for cattle and livestock. The [[horse]]s of the duke and [[Daggerford militia]] grazed here during times of peace.
