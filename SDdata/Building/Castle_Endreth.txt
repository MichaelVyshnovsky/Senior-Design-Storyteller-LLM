Castle Endreth was a crumbling ruin near Starmantle. It was used by the Magister Talatha Vaerovree as a refuge.
The keep was near Starmantle.
It was a roofless heap by the , with extensive, leaky cellars reached by a long, descending hallway.
The hallway to the cellars was extensive and powerfully trapped. The spells still shielding it acted as a shield against anything not being wielded by a living creature, reflected all lightning bolt-related spells directly back at their target, and had a quickly alternating reverse gravity trap that continuously dropped anyone not thinking the correct password  back and forth between floor and ceiling. Talatha kept a stone of magic missiles hidden along the passageway.
In the cellars, Talatha Vaerovree kept six potions of extra healing in silvered steel vials, a potion of vitality in a silver vial and an elixir of health in a red-painted steel vial. They were all hidden in a chest underneath a pool of water opaque with sediment.
Weavespinners had orders to regularly scour the ruin of monsters.
The castle was named after the warrior who built it. The structure was shown by Azuth to Talatha Vaerovree as a good place to lose pursuers and rest.
The castle found itself inhabited by kobolds, trolls, or perytons from time to time, only to be cleared by weavespinners sent by that purpose.
