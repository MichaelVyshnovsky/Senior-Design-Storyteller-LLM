Windcrag House was the expansive country estate of the Barelder family in Cormyr.
Windcrag House was on the Tun Shores, southwest of the Storm Horns.
The Barelder family usually preferred to spend their time at Heldartowers in Suzail rather than at Windcrag House. The country estate  and farm was tended by about a dozen servants, who raised quality riding horses, cantankerous goats, and hundreds of sheep.
