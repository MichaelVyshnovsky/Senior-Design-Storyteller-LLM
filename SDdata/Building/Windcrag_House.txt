'''Windcrag House''' was the expansive country estate of the [[Barelder]] family in [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
Windcrag House was on the [[Tun Shores]], southwest of the [[Storm Horns]].

==Inhabitants==
The Barelder family usually preferred to spend their time at [[Heldartowers]] in [[Suzail]] rather than at Windcrag House. The country estate  and farm was tended by about a dozen servants, who raised quality [[riding horse]]s, cantankerous [[goat]]s, and hundreds of [[sheep]].
