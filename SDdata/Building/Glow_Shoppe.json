        "mainbody": "The '''Glow Shoppe''' was a store in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] that sold various forms of light sources and lighting accessories in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/48/The Living City: The Glow Shop|28}}",
        "Location": "This shop was located on the west side of [[Torngel's Ride]], in the [[Mortonbrace]] Neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Uptown District|Uptown District]] of Ravens Bluff.{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "Structure": "[[File:GlowShoppeFloorplan.png|thumb|273px|''The floor plan for the Glow Shoppe.'']]\nThe building this business was housed in stood two-stories tall. It measured {{SI|44|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|31|ft|long=yes}} in width, or {{SI|1364|sq ft|long=yes}}. The first floor of the building was divided into two sections, the shop and a backroom,{{Cite polyhedron/48/The Living City: The Glow Shop|29}}\n\nOn either side of the front door were two large display windows. There metal [[oil lamp]]s with elaborate filigree shades hung on display alongside elaborate arrangements of [[candelabra]] and [[candlestick]]s.\n\nThe backroom was used for storage of the Glow Shoppe's [[cask]]s and [[barrel]]s of [[oil]], but also was where the shop's various [[candle]]-making supplies were kept. These included blocks of [[tallow]] and [[wax]], a large [[cauldron]] for melting the wax in, [[candle mold]]s, dipping rods, [[dye]]s, [[perfume]]s, and [[wick]]s. While only \"blocks of wax\" are mentioned among the list of candle making supplies, it is safe to assume that blocks of tallow would also be present since the Glow Shoppe sells tallow candles and it's stated that the candles are made on the premises.",
        "Services": "The Glow Shoppe didn't take special orders, only selling what they had on hand, but the stock of things they sold were all offered at fair prices. Due to being a man who dreamed of having an adventurous life himself, the owner was sometimes willing to offer a special discount to [[adventurer]]s in exchange for tales of their heroics, especially adventurers who were attractive women.\n\nOn the display counter and many shelves of this store one could find the items that Glow Shoppe always had on hand. These included [[lamp]]s, candles, candle holders like candlesticks and candlelabrae, [[flint and steel]], [[tinderbox]]es, and [[iron]] torch holders. The lamps sold by the store were made of either [[ceramic]], glass, or metal. [[Torch]]es for sale were all stacked in one corner. [[Lantern]]s of all sizes were sold, strung up for display on a line that ran across the shop, and wooden lantern poles for sale were kept standing in a barrel.\n\nThe tallow and wax candles sold in the store were all made on the premises by [[Sul Loman]]. The wax candles were offered in plain, colored, and scented varieties. The candlesticks on offer were made of either wood or [[brass]], whilst the candlelabrae were made of either iron or brass. Varieties of both, made of unusual or precious materials, were also sometimes offered but they could cost up to five times the standard price.\n\nRarely, the shop sold some items that had ''[[continual light]]'' cast on them. These were usually cheap [[gem]]s, metal candlesticks, and hardwood [[wand]]s. These were all kept beneath the counter within iron and [[lead]] boxes, though they also sold even smaller and tightly-made boxes for the transport of individual items. Instances of this spell were provided to the shop irregularly through an agreement made with several local [[mage]]s. Such ''continual light'' objects notably were provided to fellow Ravenian business [[Signs Painted]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/70/The Living City: Signs Painted|15}}\n\nBesides lighting objects, the Glow Shoppe sold lamp oil. Many city residents regularly purchased lamp oil from the store, making it one the shop's bulk goods alongside candles, lamps, and torches. They were willing to dispense this oil to customers in whatever containers or lamps they brought with them, but also sold it in containers of various sizes and styles. These included hand-barrels, [[sealing wax|wax-sealed]] glass [[carafe]]s, {{SIAdj|4|ft|long=yes}} metal pipes that were capped and sealed at both ends, and even {{SI|25|gal}} [[keg]]s. They also offered their lamp oil as delivery within casks or kegs, willing to deliver to anywhere in Ravens Bluff.",
        "Inhabitants": "The store was operated by [[Tuk Loman]] with occasional assistance from his mother and grandmother, Sul Loman and [[Nola Loman]], a pair of retired [[adventurer]]s. All three of them lived above the shop."
