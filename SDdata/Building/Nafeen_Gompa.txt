Nafeen Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot.
It stood in southern Tabot, amongst the jungles south of the Haraki Ridge.
It was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Nafeen.
Around , Nafeen and Zotung Gompas and the other southern monasteries complained strenuously about the High Lords tithings and adopted radical stances, thus paralyzing the yig-tsang (monk council) and presaging a separatist movement. It was even rumored they harbored Phen Do. He was in fact hidden in the mountains to the east of Nafeen.
That year, yeti emerged from the Wu Pi Te Shar mountains and raided Nafeen Gompa, killing 23 and causing great damage, triggering fears of another Kume Sa Yeti. The dzong-pon (sheriff) of Thok district organized a hunting expedition against them, distributing printed handbills around southwestern Tabot. Nafeen Gompa received an initial 25 volunteers from Eotzi Gompa for the expedition.
Pang, a monk of Pokarr Gompa was dismissive of Nafeen and Zotung Gompas, declaring they did not follow "the true and holy laws of the High Lord" as Pokarr did.
