        "mainbody": "The '''Cathedral of Helm''' was the grand fortress-temple dedicated to the [[Helm|God of Guardians]], a beacon of faith in the city that bore his name, [[Helm's Hold]]. For many years it stood strong as a sanctuary for the poor and magically-afflicted of the region, enduring abandonment by its clergy, natural disaster, and even all-out war throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "[[File:HelmCathedral.png|thumb|left|350px|The entrance to the Cathedral during the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] ''circa'' [[1479 DR]].]]\nHelm's Cathedral was the most striking structure in the Hold, in a manner that accommodated acoustics that blocked all but the most raucous sounds.  \n\nThe grounds of the cathedral housed several smaller structures that helped Helm's clergy bring aid to those most in need. Among these were an orphanage, multiple hospital wards, and even a clinic to aid those suffering from madness.\n\nIt was originally built upon vast underground chambers known as the [[Crypts of the Vigilant Eye]], underground burial chambers that were used by the faithful of Helm for many years.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The Cathedral had specific architectural acoustics that created an impressive, but peaceful place of worship."
        },
        "Activities": "For the entirety of its existence in Helm's Hold, the Cathedral served as a home to the most unfortunate people of the region.",
        "History": "The expansion of [[Dumal Erard]]s' abbey into a grand cathedral began in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, the year that marked the death of Helm himself. Rather than abandon their temple, the people of Helm's Hold finished it as a testament to honor their god's memory. The [[Sanatorium]] was built within the underground levels of the cathedral following the [[Spellplague]], facilitating the Cathedral's transition into a sanctuary that offered institutional care for the poor souls afflicted by the Blue Fire.\n\nEven though much of Helm's Hold was damaged in the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]], in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, the cathedral remained unharmed. By this time however it had been largely abandoned by the Helmite clergy.\n\n[[File:CathedralSanatorium.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The interior of the cathedral being used as a makeshift hospital]]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, the city of [[Neverwinter]] enacted the uncompromising ''[[Protector's Law]]'', which stated that any spellscarred within the city had to be removed from its borders and sent to the sanatorium in Helm's Hold. In the following years the Neverwintan government funneled significant funds to help maintain the sanatorium and further research for the care of its residents.\n\nSome time during the 1470s [[DR]], a [[human]] woman by the name of [[Rohini]] came to Helm's Hold portending the return of Helm to the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]]. Her proclamation earned her great renown and popularity along with the title of The Prophet. Supported by the [[Heirs of Azure]] political movement, Rohini rapidly gained veneration throughout the city and became the ''de facto'' leader the Cathedral of Helm along with its underground Sanatorium.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, it was revealed that Rohini was in fact a [[succubus]], as well as the leader of the [[Ashmadai]]. During her reign over the temple Rohini tortured the residents of the Sanatorium, and used them as pawns in the schemes of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] and the evil goals of her own devilish cult. She claimed the Cathedral as her seat of power and took over the entirety of Helm's Hold, even managing to summon forth a terrible ''[[pit fiend]]'' [[baatezu]] within the temples austere walls.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], the succubus Rohini was removed from power by the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]]. The hero infiltrated the Sanatorium through a secret underground entrance, battled through scores of [[foulspawn]], and defeated Rohini in the great hall of the Cathedral. Reinforcements from the [[Neverwinter Guard]] arrived shortly after, helping [[Dunfield|Captain Dunfield]] reclaim the Cathedral and the rest of Helm's Hold.\n\n[[File:Summoning Circle.png|thumb|right|350px|The chaotic effects formed beneath the cathedral]]\nShortly after Rohini's fall, the [[Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] ventured beneath the cathedral to slay the few remaining Ashmadai cultist that were lingering within its catacombs and lower dungeons. During their expedition they slew the [[succubus]] [[Mizreal|Mizreal Everdark]] and defeated the [[pit fiend]] [[Baelrath]], moments after it was brought forth to [[Toril]] by means of a [[summoning circle]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, supervision of the Cathedral was taken over by Holy Watcher [[Qerria]], a zealous member the [[Order of the Gilded Eye]]. and gain misgivings about the peace of the Cathedral, feeling there was an unspeakable evil dwelling in the lowest depths underneath Helm's temple.",
        "Inhabitants": "The [[dwarven]] priest [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] remained a strong presence in the cathedral over the course of its century-long history. He taught the ways of Helm and helped the city's destitute long after the other Helmite clergy left the faith."
