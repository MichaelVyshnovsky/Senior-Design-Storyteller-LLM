'''The Royal Arms''' was a modern, beautiful, and expensive inn located in [[Luskan]] ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==Description==
The Royal Arms was a modern and beautiful inn for its time. It was a three-story building with huge double doors.

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
The inn's interior was lush and expensive, fit for kings and princes. The walls were decorated with rich tapestries, and golden statues were placed around the dining hall with a sweeping grand staircase in the middle of it.

The inn was not often crowded, only hosting a handful of clients at a time and catering to wealthy merchants and dignitaries. Very few locals could afford to custom the Royal Arms. The owner, [[Bartholomew Tidfigit]] made it perfectly clear that if you can't afford the services, he was not interested in you.

==Services==
The inn offered lodging and served only the best of fine food and wine, permeating the entire building with their alluring aromas.

Among items served to the guests were [[tea]] and [[muffin]]s.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the inn hosted [[Boswell Peddywinkle]] (secretly [[Celerum|Celerum the Black]]) who was assembling a trade caravan to [[Targos]] and was in need of competent guards and adventurers.
