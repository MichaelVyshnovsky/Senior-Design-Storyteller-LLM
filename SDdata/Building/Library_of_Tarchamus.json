        "mainbody": "The '''Library of Tarchamus''' was a secret library hidden deep inside a mountain in ancient [[Netheril]].",
        "Location": "The library was located in the [[Nether Mountains]] on the northern edge of the [[High Forest]] a few days' journey from what would later be [[Everlund]] in the [[Silver Marches]]. It was hidden deep inside a mountain, and accessing it required traversing a series of flooded caves known as [[Xammux]]. Deep within these caverns was the domed library sealed by large stone doors.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils||8-9}}",
        "Interior": "The library had three levels and was said to have housed over 100,000 volumes.{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|4080}} The central level had a huge domed ceiling and was lit by mage lights. A total of 120 bookcases radiated out from the center of this level. The lower level contained a pit where Tarchamus's mummy resided, as well as air vents, which could be used as an escape route. Powerful wards were placed throughout the library to prevent scrying. There were also traps, although most were [[illusion]]s.\n\nAdditionally, the ''[[Book of Tarchamus]]'', which contained Tarchamus's consciousness, sat on a pedestal in the central area on the second level.",
        "History": "The library was built by the legendary [[arcanist]] [[Tarchamus the Unyielding]] both as a repository for his knowledge and as a trap for his Netherese rivals. Many Netherese arcanists fell victim to traps or Tarchamus's mummy while searching the library for his secrets.\n\nThe library was destroyed in [[Flamerule]] of the {{yearlinkName|1478}}, by the [[warlock]] [[Farideh]] and her [[cambion]] master [[Lorcan]] and their allies in order to prevent [[Shadovar]] from gaining access to the library's knowledge.",
        "Inhabitants": "The library was inhabited by the [[ghost]]s of Tarchamus's apprentices as well as Tarchamus's [[mummy]].{{Cite digital book/Lesser Evils|3481}}"
