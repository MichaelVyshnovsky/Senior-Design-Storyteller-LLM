The '''Tower of the Masked Mage''' was a temple to [[Vhaeraun]] in [[Sshamath]].

==Description==
Sshamath was a [[drow]] city in an [[Underdark]] cavern, with the temple hanging from the cavern's roof. It was situated in the Darkwoods district,

==Membership==
The city was unique among drow cities in that it wasn't ruled by a clergy but by mages. [[Vhaeraun]], under the alias Masked Mage or Lord of Shadow, was primarily worshiped in his role as the drow patron of [[shadow magic]] and spellfilchers. Religion and divine magic weren't viewed highly in the city and the same applied to this temple's faith. Due to this reason, they didn't have many [[cleric]]s and the majority were [[rogue]]s and spellfilchers, as well as arcane caster who used the [[Shadow Weave]]. The head priest of this temple was Shadow Sorcerer [[Pharaun Lhalabar]] who, despite his title, didn't possess any arcane capabilities.

==History==
The [[School of the Shadow Weave]] was an attempt to get a seat in Sshamath's ruling body.

During the [[Silence of Lolth]], Lolth's priesthood lost their powers and Vhaeraun's clerics took the official positions formerly held by Lolth's clergy.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|9-10}} 

When Vhaeraun died in the course of the [[War of the Spider Queen]], a minority tried to convert to [[Eilistraee]] to follow the remainder of their former deity, but they were killed by those who converted to [[Shar]].
