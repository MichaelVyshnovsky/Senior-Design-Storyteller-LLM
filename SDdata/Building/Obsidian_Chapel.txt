'''The Obsidian Chapel''' was the temple to [[Bane]], the Lord of Darkness that stood in the desert of [[Anauroch]].

==History==
''The Obsidian Chapel'' once held the [[enchanted]] [[Loviatan]] [[halberd]] - ''[[the Icon of Power]]''. The weapon was the traditional armament of from the [[Black Spires of the Maiden]], wielded by the temple's [[Whip of Obedience]]. The halberd was purchased by the [[Church of Bane]] from an unnamed thief who stole the weapon and the the Obsidian Chapel kept the halberd out of contempt for the Whip's incompetence.

The temple remained unconquered until it was raided and plundered by the [[Bedine]] sometime before [[1281 DR]].
