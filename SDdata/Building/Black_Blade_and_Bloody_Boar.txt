The '''Black Blade and Bloody Boar''' was a rough-and-tumble tavern that was renowned as perhaps the most unsavory establishment found in city of [[Mulmaster]].{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|13-15}} It also served as a bloody area run one of the city's most notorious criminals, [[Gethmedra Darmov]].

==Location==
It was found amid the squalor that was the southern region of Mulmaster,{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|8-10}}

==Interior==
The main feature of the tavern's spacious common room was the great fighting pit set {{SI|20|ft}} deep within its floor, known as the "Boar Pit". Off to the sides of the fighting area were a magnificent hearth, within which often roasted a [[giant boar]] (as befitting the tavern's name), a single throne offered only to the tavern's owner, and a {{SI|10|ft}}-tall seated [[bronze]] statue that held a casket full of invaluable ''[[magic]]al [[potion]]s''. Viewing galleries encircle the common room, allowing bystanders to fully take in each match.

Beneath the inn's floor were a series of pens that housed its gladiatorial combatants.

===Atmosphere===
==Services==
As of the late 15{{th}} century, the tavern bar was tended by the diminutive and matronly woman known to her patrons only as [[Ma]]. She offered a variety goods and services to her clientele, such as watered-down ale for the low price of 1 [[sp]] per [[mug]], along with information about goings-on in the city, albeit for a much steeper price.

The Black Blade's true claim to fame however were the lethal pit gladiatorial matches it held for the entertainment of the city's nobility. Challengers would be thrown into the pit to face off terrifying combatants, such as the [[Fangs of the Chimera]] fighting group, or perhaps the [[chimera|monstrous beast]] after which they were named.

==Defenses==
The Black Blade was protected by the guardsmen loyal to Lady Darmov, the Fangs of the Chimera gladiators, as well as the enigmatic mage [[Devamari]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
* [[Bh√∫n Ludwakazar|The Stone Dwarf]], a pit fighter that survived the odds of the tavern's arena and became its champion for some time.
