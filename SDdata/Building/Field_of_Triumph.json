Over four hundred bets were placed on the horse named [[Song of the Wind]] before the Field was able to update the odds board. The horse won three lengths ahead of the favorite steed, landing the Field of Triumph into debt. The establishment loaned a hefty sum of approximately ten-million [[Golden lion (coin)|golden lions]] from the noble [[Cassalanter]] family to pay the winnings out.",
