        "mainbody": "'''Uvaeren's Legacy''', also known as the '''Legacy Library''', was a unique repository of knowledge found in [[Myth Drannor]] that offered tremendous amount of lore to knowledge-seekers, albeit in unusual ways that seldom involved the reading of [[book]]s or other documents.",
        "Location": "Uvaeren's Legacy was situated on the western side of the [[Street of Sorrows]] in the [[Myth Drannor/Dlabraddath|Dlabraddath]] district of the city.",
        "Structure": "The grand stone library comprised four stories, and four different sides, with wide-set stairs leading up to an entrance on each side.",
        "Interior": "The first floor of the library held an open-air space lined with statues of knowledgeable sages and scholars, in the form of the various races that called Myth Drannor Home. Rooms found throughout this floor  included the Hall of Scents, the Lorespirits' Room, the Hall of Crystal,\n\nThe top three floors of the library's Legacy Tower composed the Memory Chamber, a massive domed chamber whose walls were embedded with the same empathic crystals found in the Hall of Crystal. Within these ''[[tel'kiira]]''-like [[crystal]]s were thousands of years of collected emotions, nightmares, aspirations, and accumulated knowledge. Within the chamber was a seat that resembled [[spelljamming helm]] in its function, allowing [[elves]] to access the collected information of the crystals, or instilling madness into the minds of other races.",
        "Services": "Knowledge could be ingested in ways that were not possible in other libraries or houses of knowledge. Bottled fragrances in the Hall of Scents could be used to bring up memories and help identify certain pungent plants and substances; singing along with the library's statues would reveal new lyrics and notes; patterns of twinkling flashes of light could reveal hidden lore during meditations sessions; and empathic crystals that evoked feelings that uttered specific [[command word]]s when standing before a mural or sculpture, or while accessing the Memory Chamber.",
        "Defenses": "The four entrances of the library were guarded by [[stone guardian]]s that occasionally offered information about where to access information within the library.\n\nThe Memory Chamber was always watched over by two members of the [[Akh'Faer]] and at least one [[amrathor]]."
