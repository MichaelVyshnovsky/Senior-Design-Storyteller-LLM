        "mainbody": "vaerens Legacy, also known as the Legacy Library, was a unique repository of knowledge found in Myth Drannor that offered tremendous amount of lore to knowledge-seekers, albeit in unusual ways that seldom involved the reading of books or other documents.\nUvaerens Legacy was situated on the western side of the Street of Sorrows in the Dlabraddath district of the city.\nThe grand stone library comprised four stories, and four different sides, with wide-set stairs leading up to an entrance on each side.\nThe first floor of the library held an open-air space lined with statues of knowledgeable sages and scholars, in the form of the various races that called Myth Drannor Home. Rooms found throughout this floor  included the Hall of Scents, the Lorespirits Room, the Hall of Crystal,\nThe top three floors of the librarys Legacy Tower composed the Memory Chamber, a massive domed chamber whose walls were embedded with the same empathic crystals found in the Hall of Crystal. Within these telkiira-like crystals were thousands of years of collected emotions, nightmares, aspirations, and accumulated knowledge. Within the chamber was a seat that resembled spelljamming helm in its function, allowing elves to access the collected information of the crystals, or instilling madness into the minds of other races.\nKnowledge could be ingested in ways that were not possible in other libraries or houses of knowledge. Bottled fragrances in the Hall of Scents could be used to bring up memories and help identify certain pungent plants and substances singing along with the librarys statues would reveal new lyrics and notes patterns of twinkling flashes of light could reveal hidden lore during meditations sessions and empathic crystals that evoked feelings that uttered specific command words when standing before a mural or sculpture, or while accessing the Memory Chamber.\nThe four entrances of the library were guarded by stone guardians that occasionally offered information about where to access information within the library.\nThe Memory Chamber was always watched over by two members of the AkhFaer and at least one amrathor."
