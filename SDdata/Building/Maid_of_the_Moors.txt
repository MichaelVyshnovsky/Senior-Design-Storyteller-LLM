'''Maid of the Moors''' was [[Beldora Thiiruin]]'s a warm and welcoming restaurant in [[Mornbryn's Shield]] that served a limited but hearty menu including the local specialty, the [[bustards]]. Maid of the Moors was the only restaurant found in the Shield ''circa'' [[1365 DR]].

==Description==
The Maid was a happy and uplifting spot in the dampness and dangers of the [[Evermoors]] where the hamlet of Mornbryn's Shield was located.

The building itself had huge windows, filling the restaurant with the daylight. In case of storms or very common [[troll]] attacks on the hamlet, the restaurant covered the windows with fitted shutters.

The interior was welcoming, well-lit, with [[fern]]s and other types of plants hanging around the dining room.

==Services==
The Maid carried food and non-alcoholic drinks. Beldora herself simply did not have enough time nor hands to serve alcohol or more complex mixed concoctions and simply recommended guests to stop at the [[Troll in Flames]] Inn for a pint. Maid of the Moors served [[tea]], [[fruit juice]]s, and hearty [[broth]]s.

The meals of note served at the Maid included a few dishes. A fresh [[salad]] of local [[lettuce]], [[olive]]s, [[parsley]], [[parsnip]]s, [[cheese]], and [[whitecurds]] (what we know as cottage cheese). A [[fryplate]], all the fried goodness like [[tomato]]es, [[bacon]], [[mushroom]]s, all covered in sliced [[almond]]s, generously [[butter]]ed [[scrambled egg]]s with [[pepper]] and a splash of [[brandy]]. [[Bustards]], the locally hunted [[ground quail]] of the Evermoors, cooked smothered in [[clay]] inside the flaming [[oven]], then in a covered [[pot]], and served with quail [[egg]]s, vegetables and [[beef]] [[tallow]]. Beldora served bustards (two birds per order) on a large [[plate]] of abundant roasted vegetables and [[cabbage]].
