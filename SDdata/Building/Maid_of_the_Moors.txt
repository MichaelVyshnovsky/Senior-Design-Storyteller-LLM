Maid of the Moors was Beldora Thiiruins a warm and welcoming restaurant in Mornbryns Shield that served a limited but hearty menu including the local specialty, the bustards. Maid of the Moors was the only restaurant found in the Shield circa 1365 DR.
The Maid was a happy and uplifting spot in the dampness and dangers of the Evermoors where the hamlet of Mornbryns Shield was located.
The building itself had huge windows, filling the restaurant with the daylight. In case of storms or very common troll attacks on the hamlet, the restaurant covered the windows with fitted shutters.
The interior was welcoming, well-lit, with ferns and other types of plants hanging around the dining room.
The Maid carried food and non-alcoholic drinks. Beldora herself simply did not have enough time nor hands to serve alcohol or more complex mixed concoctions and simply recommended guests to stop at the Troll in Flames Inn for a pint. Maid of the Moors served tea, fruit juices, and hearty broths.
The meals of note served at the Maid included a few dishes. A fresh salad of local lettuce, olives, parsley, parsnips, cheese, and whitecurds (what we know as cottage cheese). A fryplate, all the fried goodness like tomatoes, bacon, mushrooms, all covered in sliced almonds, generously buttered scrambled eggs with pepper and a splash of brandy. Bustards, the locally hunted ground quail of the Evermoors, cooked smothered in clay inside the flaming oven, then in a covered pot, and served with quail eggs, vegetables and beef tallow. Beldora served bustards (two birds per order) on a large plate of abundant roasted vegetables and cabbage.
