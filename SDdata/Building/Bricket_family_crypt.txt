'''Bricket family crypt''' was one of the bigger underground tombs located in the [[Daggerford Graveyard]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].

==Location==
The crypt was located to the east from the mausoleum of Daggerford Graveyard, [[Eastern Farmlands]], across from a lush [[apple]] orchard. The crypt's entrance led downstairs to the spacious interior. In front of the heavy tomb door, a stone marker with the family's name could be found.

==Interior==
The crypt's subterranean hall was a big square room. The center of the structure was illuminated with a lit brazier atop a mosaic floor assembled to resemble a sun. The walls of the crypt held burial niches while four grand decorated sarcophagi stood across from each wall. Two of the smaller and less decorated sarcophagi stood on each side of the bigger ones.

[[Elveronne Bricket]]'s sarcophagus, after his burial in 1372 DR, was inscribed with "Whose home was at his country house, but whose heart lay in the forest."

==History==
The Bricket family crypt was the final resting place for many generations of the Brickets of Daggerford. The crypt's peace was disturbed in 1372 DR when Elveronne Bricket rose up, past his interring ceremony, opened the sarcophagus, and shambled away. The restless vengefulness of the deceased birthed the undead, who was murdered by his seeming kingly sisters [[Alicine Bricket|Alicine]] and [[Muriel Bricket]]. The Funeral Director and mortician, at the time, [[Moris Olgrund]] was shocked by the loss of one of his corpses, especially after the burial. In fears of damaging his family's reputation, Moris asked the [[Hero of Daggerford]] to track the vengeful undead and send the spirit into the realms of [[Kelemvor]].
