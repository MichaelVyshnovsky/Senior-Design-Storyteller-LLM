A '''viit''' was a temporary structure used by [[Ulutiun dictionary#I|''iskotuk'']].

==Description==
The viit was a makeshift shelter used in emergencies or when the regular [[rissik]] was insufficient.

==Construction==
To construct a viit, two flexible branches, each approximately {{SIrange|6|8|in|long=yes}} long were required. One end of the first branch was secured in the ground, forming an arc shape, and then the second branch was secured perpendicularly to the first, creating a dome-like frame. A long cord was wrapped around the bottom of the frame to prevent the branches from snapping back. The frame was then covered with available skins and blankets. A layer of snow, a few inches thick, was piled around and on top of the frame. An open space was left for entry and ventilation.
