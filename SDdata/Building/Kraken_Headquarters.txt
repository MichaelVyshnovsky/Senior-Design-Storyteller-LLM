The Kraken Headquarters was the main command post of the Kraken Society in the midâ€“14 century DR, located on the isle of Trisk in the Purple Rocks in the Trackless Sea.
The gargantuan stronghold took up much of the isle of Trisk, and resembled a stone fortress with tentacle-shaped columns.
The front of the building itself was carved to bear the semblance of a squid that was  tall. The eyes of the squid carving glowed with hidden light.
The inside of the castle was filled with those of the society, and margoyles, scrags, and otyughs. The scrags themselves seemed to have claimed part of the castle.
Well-defended forts and high parapets made up the bulk of the castle, as well as a large pier to its south.
Circa 1358 DR, the Heroes of Ascore-to-be invaded the fortress and secured a magical statuette, which was stored in a pearl chest.
