The '''Kraken Headquarters''' was the main command post of the [[Kraken Society]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], located on the isle of [[Trisk]] in the [[Purple Rocks]] in the [[Trackless Sea]].
{{Quote
|The castle that rose above us was so great in size that it dominated the entire island, as if it were a statue and the whole of Trisk were only its base.

==Structure==
The gargantuan stronghold took up much of the isle of Trisk, and resembled a stone fortress with tentacle-shaped columns.

The front of the building itself was carved to bear the semblance of a [[squid]] that was {{SI|100|ft}} tall. The eyes of the squid carving glowed with hidden light.

==Interior==
The inside of the castle was filled with those of the society, and [[margoyle]]s, [[scrag]]s, and [[otyugh]]s. The scrags themselves seemed to have claimed part of the castle.

Well-defended forts and high parapets made up the bulk of the castle, as well as a large pier to its south.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be invaded the fortress and secured a [[magic]]al statuette, which was stored in a [[pearl]] chest.
