The '''Lightning Dragon Dojo''' was a martial arts academy founded by the [[Shou]] [[Duc-Sum Li]]. The school was located in the Shou district of [[Xiousing]] in [[Marsember]] and was named after Master Li's fighting style. When Li became too old to spar, his son [[Chang Li]] took over operation of the dojo. Shou from all over [[Faerûn]] traveled to the dojo to learn from Li.[[Dan Anderson]]. "Backdrop: Xiousing."
