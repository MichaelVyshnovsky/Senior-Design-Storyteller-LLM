        "mainbody": "The '''Crawling Spider''' was a tavern located in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The tavern had a mock underground decor made from plaster and rock rubble. Stuffed spiders hung from the ceiling, giving the tavern its namesake. Waitresses wore all-black body-suits, short [[chainmail]], and [[drow]] masks.\n\nThe tavern was dimly lit by glowing globes.\n\nMany of the \"cave\" mouths led to private chambers, the jakes, and even a cellar-level dance floor."
        },
        "Services": "Food offerings varied each night, but the fee was always 1 [[sp]] per person. The fare included a soup, a loaf of [[bread]], meat, and fried greens. Ale was 2 [[cp]] per tankard, stout 4 cp, and [[zzar]] or [[wine]] was 5 cp per tallglass. Poor-tasting whisky was offered at 1 sp per flagon.",
        "History": "The Crawling Spider was owned by a short human female named [[Welvreene Thalmit]]. She was a romantic at heart and loved adventurers.\n\nIn 1364 DR, [[Elaith Craulnober]] had a brief meeting with serving wench, thief, and part-time lover, [[Winnifer Fleetfingers]], when he learned of the quiet infiltration of the [[Knights of the Shield]] into [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Patrons": "Typical patrons of the Crawling Spider included [[dwarves]], [[half-orc]]s, and other subterranean creatures. Additionally [[priest]]s of all faiths and [[adventurer]]s were part of the regular clientele."
