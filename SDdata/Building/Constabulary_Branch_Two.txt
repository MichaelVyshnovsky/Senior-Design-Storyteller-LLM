'''Constabulary Branch Two''' was the second of the three major watch headquarters of the [[Eileanar]] [[enclave]] of [[Netheril]], alongside [[Constabulary Branch One|Branch One]] and [[Constabulary Branch Three|Branch Three]].

==Location==
The building was towards the western side of the enclave, close to the [[Academy of Mentalist Study]].

==Structure==
The ground floor of the building was partially publicly accessible, with three receptionists who handled and guided visitors. A large room behind the reception area held the desks, comfy chairs, filing cabinets, and ''[[crystal ball]]s'' of twenty low-ranking constables who worked there when they weren't out patrolling the streets.

The cellar level was made up of an expansive maze of 200 jail cells, heavily patrolled by constables on guard duty.

The upper level of the structure was home to the offices of the highest-ranking constables and commissioners who reported directly to [[Karsus]] and his trusted followers such as [[Andoris Derathar]]. The unscrupulous Chief of Constables [[Michallon]] was assisted by the opportunistic Underchiefs [[Bengel]], [[Bias]], [[Ezeddeen]], and [[Hacklander]], each in charge of 12 constables.

==Activities==
The Chief Constable kept a wide web of criminal contacts that he coordinated with, earning large amounts of money as his lawful forces exterminated the competition. The Underchiefs were his co-conspirators in this, and continued to obey his directions out of a combination of fear and greed. They cultivated a sense of awe and grandeur in the lower constables, who all believed that their commanders were the most upstanding and virtuous figures in the enclave, with Michallon the most heroic of all.

==Defenses==
The jails lacked the magical wardings of Branch One, instead relying solely on its guard patrols.
