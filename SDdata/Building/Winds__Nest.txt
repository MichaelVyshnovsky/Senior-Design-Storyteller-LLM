The Winds Nest was the local temple to Aerdrie Faenya found in the city of Myth Drannor.
The temple could be found high above Danglestar Stree in the Kerradunath district of the city.
Fitting for a holy house of Aerdrie Faenya, the Winds nest was built with out a roof, in a structure opened up to the sky above. Like a great roost or nest, it sat up the interwoven branches of three great trees, some  above ground level.
