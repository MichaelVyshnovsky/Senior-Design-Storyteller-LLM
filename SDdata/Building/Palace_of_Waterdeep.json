        "mainbody": "The Palace of Waterdeep, also known as the Lords Palace was the residence of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.\nThe white marble palace was located at the foot of Mount Waterdeep at the intersection of the Street of Silks and Waterdeep Way. In the courtyard in front of the palace stood Ahghairons Tower, and just to the north were the palace stables, paddock, and guard barracks.\nThe palace featured a Lantanese \"golemwork clock\" called Timehands that comprised dials on three faces of its highest tower. Two bells of different tones would ring out each hour, marking the hour with their number of rings.\nInside Piergeirons Palace was located a rare place of Aoist worship, with a spacious chapel lined with oaken pews. Bright painted plaster walls were decorated with gold, silver, and carved limestone and its marble floors were covered with exotic carpets from Shou Lung and illuminated with jeweled chandeliers. At the center of the furthest wall stood a large intricate stained glass window—the Eye of Ao. It gazed down on the chapels visitors in radiant indifference.\nA deep well could be found in the prisons and dungeons of the Palace. It was gated with enchanted oaken doors, magically and physically barred, and ensorcelled with the message \"DO NOT OPEN UNDER PAIN OF DEATH.\" The welled path connected the palace with Undermountain.\nThe Palace served multiple functions for the administration of the city. It was the main office for many of the citys officials including  City Watch, City Guard, and city clerks. The Lords Court also met in a large chamber on the second floor.\nThere were embassies here from many other countries and cities, although they were not required to be on the palace grounds. Guest quarters for foreign dignitaries without embassies were also available.\nThe Palace was built over the ruins of an abbey dedicated to Chauntea that was destroyed during the Second Trollwar in the mid–10 century DR. In the 1370s, relatively harmless ghosts of Chauntean monks and clerics could still be seen occasionally roaming halls and staircases that no longer existed, passing through the walls of the modern-day castle.\nThe construction and instillation of Timehands was completed in the .\nThe four meetings of the Council of Waterdeep were hosted in the Lords Palace some time during the 1480s DR."
