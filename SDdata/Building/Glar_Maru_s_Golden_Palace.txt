'''Glar Maru's Golden Palace''' was a prominent general goods emporium in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
This business was located in the [[Gowntown]] neighborhood of Ravens Bluff's [[Ravens Bluff/Temple District|Temple District]], situated at the northeast corner of [[Raphiel Street]] and [[Skulls Street (Ravens Bluff)|Skulls Street]].

==Structure==
This business was quite large for a general goods shop, standing four stories tall.

==Interior==
Many of the floors within Glar Maru's could best be described as sagging, likely due to the oppressive weight of the merchandise.

==Services==
Glar Maru's offered an expansive array of non-perishable goods, such as [[ladder|stepladder]]s or metal mixing [[bowl]]s that ranged in size from eggcups to bowls large enough for an [[armor]]ed [[knight]] to recline within. Some types of items even had entire rooms within the building devoted to them, such as [[gown]]s that were out-of-fashion and [[priest]]ly vestments that had been traded in on account of no longer fitting their owners. The business was willing to purchase any goods offered to them, but would only give [[copper piece]]s in return.

==Defenses==
The shop was monitored by a series of [[spider]]s controlled by the [[wizard]] owner. Anyone caught stealing from the store would be stricken by these spiders' paralyzing bite and have something taken off of them by Glar Maru as compensation.

==Inhabitants==
This shop was owned by and named for an old [[Tashlutan]] mage by the name of [[Glar Maru]].
