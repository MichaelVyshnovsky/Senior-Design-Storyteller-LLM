The '''Roaring Dragon''' was a large [[tavern]] found in [[Zhentil Keep]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Location==
The Roaring Dragon was located in Zhentil Keep's [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] near the center along the southern wall of the [[Zhentil Keep/Harbor District|Harbor District]].

==Activities==
The Roaring Dragon was one of the better taverns to be found in Zhentil Keep and the owner's knew it. Everything inside of the tavern was expensive. A large stage provided plenty of room for hired entertainment, bringing a bit of joy to the Zhents frequenting the tavern. After sundown the Roaring Dragon catered only to members of the [[Zhentilar]] or particularly brave individuals. A gong was sounded signaling the time when the common Zhent was invited to leave at sundown.
