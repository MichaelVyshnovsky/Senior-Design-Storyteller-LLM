The '''Prayer Stone''' was a large [[granite]] slab in the western part of the town of [[Amnwater]], in [[Amn]].

==Description==
The Stone was once part of a full [[Standing Stone|stone circle]], and acted as the only permanent temple in Amnwater. It was a multi-faith temple, and prayer to any deity was permitted, provided it did not disrupt others.
