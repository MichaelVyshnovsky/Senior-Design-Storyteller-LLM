        "mainbody": "The Emerald Tavern was a tavern and communal space located in Neverwinter Wood as of the late 15 century DR. It was a noted gathering place for members of the Emerald Enclave.\nThe Tavern was located in a wood elf settlement that sat high in the trees of Neverwinter Wood. The city of Neverwinter was visible from a large window.\nThe building was formed of tree branches and saplings that had been grafted and weaved such that they had grown and fused together.\nThe inside was bright and welcoming, with live music and lots of light. The d√©cor included elements modeled on flowers, seed pods, and leaves. The furniture was carved of wood.\nFollowing the rise to power of Forge Fitzwilliam over Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR, the new lord soon quarreled with the Emerald Enclave and the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood, who questioned his legitimacy. This led to a campaign of terror in which the Neverwinter Guard executed elves and began clear-cutting the forest. Soon, the devastation encroached upon the Emerald Tavern and was clearly visible from its windows.\nAt this time, the druid Doric&mdasha resident of the wood elf village and member of the Emerald Enclave&mdashjoined forces with Edgin Darvis, Holga Kilgore, and Simon Aumar, a group of thieves seeking to overthrow Forge. She brought them to the Emerald Tavern to discuss their plans, and they again met there after Doric infiltrated Castle Never using her wild shape ability. Once the party had successfully thwarted Forge, they met once more at the Emerald Tavern to watch a fireworks display over the city of Neverwinter."
