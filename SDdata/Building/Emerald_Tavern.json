        "mainbody": "The '''Emerald Tavern''' was a [[tavern]] and communal space located in [[Neverwinter Wood]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was a noted gathering place for members of the [[Emerald Enclave]].",
        "Location": "The Tavern was located in a [[wood elf]] settlement that sat high in the trees of Neverwinter Wood. The city of [[Neverwinter]] was visible from a large window.",
        "Structure": "The building was formed of tree branches and saplings that had been grafted and weaved such that they had grown and fused together.",
        "Interior": "The inside was bright and welcoming, with live music and lots of light. The d√©cor included elements modeled on flowers, seed pods, and leaves. The furniture was carved of wood.",
        "History": "Following the rise to power of [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] over Neverwinter in the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} the new lord soon quarreled with the Emerald Enclave and the wood elves of Neverwinter Wood, who questioned his legitimacy. This led to a campaign of terror in which the [[Neverwinter Guard]] executed [[elves]] and began clear-cutting the forest. Soon, the devastation encroached upon the Emerald Tavern and was clearly visible from its windows.\n\nAt this time, the [[druid]] [[Doric]]&mdash;a resident of the wood elf village and member of the Emerald Enclave&mdash;joined forces with [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], and [[Simon Aumar]], a group of thieves seeking to overthrow Forge. She brought them to the Emerald Tavern to discuss their plans, and they again met there after Doric infiltrated [[Castle Never]] using her ''[[wild shape]]'' ability. Once the party had successfully thwarted Forge, they met once more at the Emerald Tavern to watch a [[firework]]s display over the city of Neverwinter."
