The Last Stop was a tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The Last Stop was located in Zhentil Keeps Inner Quarter near the center of the city just off Elephstron Way.
Exotic liquors such as golden lionheart, icehoney, and dewberry blush wine could be ejoyed in the Last Stop.
Zhentarim wizards and naug-adar favored the Last Stop. Non-Zhentarim wizards who wished to join the Black Network often came to here for information or to join.
