At the suggestion of the elderly [[Octavian Spellstone]], the adventurers sought out two of Aaron's former lovers, one of them being the High Priestess of The Cat's Meow. There they obtained an audience with the [[priestess]] in her private offices, who directed them to where they could find Aaron's other former lover, the [[ranger]] [[Symone Hawks-Talon]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Heir Un-Apparent|11-13}}\n\nA young Sharessan acolyte, [[Phaedra Dreamingeyes]], had just arrived in the city and temple by the time of these adventurers' arrival.{{Cite organized play/LC/Heir Un-Apparent|13}}",
        "Inhabitants": "The High Priestess of the temple was one [[Daryian Catseyes]]. A strapping young male Sharessan by the name of [[Castilian]] stood guard at the entryway."
