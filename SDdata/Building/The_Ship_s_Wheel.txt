The Ships Wheel was a tavern located in the city of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The tavern was located in the western section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward on the north side of Diamond Street where it joined Westwall Street near the West Gate.
The front of the tavern was adorned with a shining ships wheel sized to be used by a titan. The Ships Wheel was a two story building.
The Ships Wheel had a reputation for being one of the safest taverns around. Most activity within the tavern never got more exciting than the old patrons watching each others hair fall out.
The tavern was owned by a man named Olhin Shalut.
