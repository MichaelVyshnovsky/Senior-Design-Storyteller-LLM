The '''temple of Abbathor''' was a temple structure built into the rocky formation within the [[Sword Mountains]], dedicated to [[Abbathor]], [[Morndinsamman|dwarven deity]] of greed.

==Location==
It was situated in a cleft within the mountains, east of [[Leilon]], about {{SI|15|mi|k}} southwest of [[Phandalin]].

==Structure==
The temple structure was hewn out of solid stone, in the facade of the mountainside. Just outside its main entrance was a small settlement that was long-since abandoned.

==Interior==
While it was a rather small structure, the temple featured a number of hidden doors and passageways. The easternmost chamber, known as the Hall of Greed, held a valuable looking but trapped [[gem]], that would cause an explosion if disturbed.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] two dwarven prospectors, [[Dazlyn Grayshard]] and [[Norbus Ironrune]] uncovered the ruins of the temple while looking for [[gold]] in the mountains.

==Inhabitants==
The ruins of the temple were mostly barren, save for a pair of [[ochre jellies]] that took up residence within.
