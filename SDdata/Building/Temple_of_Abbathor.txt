The temple of Abbathor was a temple structure built into the rocky formation within the Sword Mountains, dedicated to Abbathor, dwarven deity of greed.
It was situated in a cleft within the mountains, east of Leilon, about  southwest of Phandalin.
The temple structure was hewn out of solid stone, in the facade of the mountainside. Just outside its main entrance was a small settlement that was long-since abandoned.
While it was a rather small structure, the temple featured a number of hidden doors and passageways. The easternmost chamber, known as the Hall of Greed, held a valuable looking but trapped gem, that would cause an explosion if disturbed.
In the late 15 century DR two dwarven prospectors, Dazlyn Grayshard and Norbus Ironrune uncovered the ruins of the temple while looking for gold in the mountains.
The ruins of the temple were mostly barren, save for a pair of ochre jellies that took up residence within.
