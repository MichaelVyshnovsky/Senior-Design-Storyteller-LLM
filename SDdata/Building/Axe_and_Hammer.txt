The '''Axe and Hammer''', nicknamed ''' The Tomb''', was a spacious and calm inn found in the city of [[Elversult]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Interior==
===Atmosphere===
It had a reputation as a peaceful place to get lots of rest after an exhausting journey, though not one that was particularly lively or fun. Its rather subdued atmosphere led to the nickname of ''The Tomb''.

==Services==
The Axe and Hammer was run by an all-[[dwarven]] staff and made every effort to protect its patrons and keep the peace.
