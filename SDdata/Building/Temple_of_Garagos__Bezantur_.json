        "mainbody": "The Temple of Garagos was a place of worship dedicated to Garagos in the city of Bezantur, Thay, that also served as an inn known as Santhros Rooming House in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe temple was located just inside the western wall of Bezantur&mdashthe so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\"&mdashjust north of the citys west gate. This gate made the temple convenient to caravans arriving in town from Thasselen and Thays coastal cities.\nThe temple was located inside a rundown tenement building.\nAs an inn, rooms could be rented from the Temple for one gold piece per month. Meals were only served to customers who asked nicely.\nAs a place of worship, the Temple catered to a small group of Garagoss faithful. Despite the congregation being small, they were enthusiastic about their god.\nAs of the , the Temple of Garagos was one of only a few temples remaining to the god in all of Faer√ªn (once worshiped throughout the Inner Sea), and even within the City of a Thousand Temples, the Reaver was not a popular god as he was widely believed to have been killed by Tempus. This forced High Priest Santhro to fight against these perceptions, and ultimately to convert the temple into a boarding house in order to make some money."
