        "mainbody": "Ramoras Guile Shipping and Freight was a shipping business in the Lower Port of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nRamoras Guile Shipping and Freight was a modest one-story building with a basement.\nRamoras Guile Shipping and Freight was known for its selective business practices. It rarely accepted freight from walk-in customers, consistently claiming full capacity. It was in fact a front for small-time smuggling operations, which specialized in attaching contraband to the undersides of vessels using watertight containers. Smuggled goods were securely stored on-site, protected by four trained war dogs and a series of magical and mechanical traps.\nAs of 1370 DR, Ramoras Guile focused primarily on transporting smokepowder for the Brigadier.\nRamoras Guile Shipping and Freight was owned by Sheila Kells. Despite numerous attempts by the Pirate Tyrant, Misker, to take over her operations, Sheila had thus far managed to resist them, though many believed it was only a matter of time before she was forced to align with his organization.\nIn support of their arrangement, the Brigadier provided Sheila with an enchanted dagger for personal defense and a small enchanted crystal globe, which she wore on a chain around her neck. Should the globe be shattered, it signaled the Brigadier, who would then arrive fully armed to defend his assets at Ramoras."
