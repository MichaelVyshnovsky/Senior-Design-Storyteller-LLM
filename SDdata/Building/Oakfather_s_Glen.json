        "mainbody": "The '''Oakfather's Glen''' was a temple to [[Silvanus]] and safehold for those devoted to the Oakfather in the town of [[Brost]] in the nation of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Geography": "The petrified tree was located in a park near the center of town.",
        "Description": "It was once a living [[oak]] tree large enough to be carved and shaped into a temple, and later magically petrified, turning it to stone. The tree retained its branches and leaves enough to provide shade in the surrounding park.",
        "History": "By the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the oak tree known as Oakfather's Glen had already been petrified for centuries.",
        "Inhabitants": "Around [[1370 DR]], there were at least twenty-five worshipers on site. A druid named [[Acrull Northshield]] officiated as the ranking priest and was aided directly by four other druids of the faith of Silvanus with an additional retinue of twenty lesser attendants."
