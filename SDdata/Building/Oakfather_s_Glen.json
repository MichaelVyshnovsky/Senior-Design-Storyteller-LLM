        "mainbody": "The Oakfathers Glen was a temple to Silvanus and safehold for those devoted to the Oakfather in the town of Brost in the nation of Tethyr.\nThe petrified tree was located in a park near the center of town.\nIt was once a living oak tree large enough to be carved and shaped into a temple, and later magically petrified, turning it to stone. The tree retained its branches and leaves enough to provide shade in the surrounding park.\nBy the midâ€“14 century DR, the oak tree known as Oakfathers Glen had already been petrified for centuries.\nAround 1370 DR, there were at least twenty-five worshipers on site. A druid named Acrull Northshield officiated as the ranking priest and was aided directly by four other druids of the faith of Silvanus with an additional retinue of twenty lesser attendants."
