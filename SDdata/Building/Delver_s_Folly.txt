Delvers Folly was a workshop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
Delvers Folly was a one-story building of wood and plaster in fair condition.
Delvers Folly was operated by a team of skilled engineers, all of whom were accomplished rogues. Delvers Folly offered a wide array of traps designed to meet diverse security needs. From concealed pits and flaming oil jets to intricate, self-rearming scythe blades, Delverâ€™s Folly provided solutions for individuals seeking reliable protection in the treacherous environment of Skullport.
The quality of their craftsmanship was exceptional, but their services did not come cheap. Unique and complex mechanisms commanded prices exceeding 5,000 gold pieces.
Leading the operation was Lystand the Pick, a human thief and former adventurer from Waterdeep. With her background in designing and bypassing intricate security systems, Lystand specialized in crafting traps that were as lethal as they are difficult to disarm. Her poison gas and dart traps, in particular, were infamous for their complexity.
