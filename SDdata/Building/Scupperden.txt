'''Scupperden''' was an eatery located in the Dredge, the lowest level of [[Skullport]]. The establishment was known primarily for its [[stew]] made of [[fish]], [[mushroom]]s and [[vegetable]] scraps which sold for 1 [[cp]] per [[bowl]]. The stew was described as somewhat alarming but unlikely to kill the eater.
