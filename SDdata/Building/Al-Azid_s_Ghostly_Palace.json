        "Inhabitants": "Beyond whosoever claimed ownership of the Ghostly Palace, its halls were forever inhabited by a staff of [[unseen servant]]s. These catered to the every whim of whoever owned the palace, owner's every whim, whether it be cleaning, cooking, or menial chores. Invisible musicians also filled the palace's halls with gentle, strumming music,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|6}} that trailed out its windows.",
        "History": "The palace was named for its original owner, [[Al-Azid]], who placed a curse upon his home to ensure that any future owners would not enjoy the palace after his death. Once someone used the key to the front gate of the palace, they would be forever haunted by an [[invisible stalker]].{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|17}} Long after his death, Al-Azid's legendary home and the key to summon it became valued by some at values as high as 40,000 [[gold piece]]s.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the last known owner of ''Al-Azid's Ghostly Palace'' was a retired [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] merchant from [[Huzuz]] by the name of [[Gorar Al-Nisr]] and his [[djinn]] wife [[Zuelia]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|16-17}} who in turn had inherited it from his late father. Undeterred by the curse, the two regularly moved from place to place, settling down for a time before the invisible stalker inevitably discovered their location. The two came to enjoy their game of cat-and-mouse with the invisible stalker.\n\nOne warm summer day in [[the Vast]],{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|8}} This blocked not only the trail, but the land on either side of it. in turn disrupting merchant traffic in the area and covering up a local [[bandit]] tribe's buried cache of treasure. Gorar was unaware of these problems his palace's manifestation point had caused.\n\nThis treasure included pieces of art{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|20}} and four ''[[iron flask]]s'', the contents of which the bandits had planned to unleash in Ravens Bluff during a council meeting and then use the resulting mayhem as cover to loot noble homes. However, the Ghostly Palace's weight broke the ''iron flasks'', unleashing the [[elemental]]s and monsters they held within upon the nearby grounds. Desiring compensation for their lost plan and revenge upon the palace's owner, the bandits were determined to keep any Ravenians from getting near until they could find a way around the creatures and inside to loot the palace.It is unclear which \"council\" the text is referring to, as Ravens Bluff has an [[Advisory Council]], [[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]], and [[Merchants Council]]. The text mentions this failed plan would have occurred \"in the midst of the city lords and politicians\", so it could possibly be referring to the Council of Lords.\n\nOne of the Lord Mayor's messengers were on their way back to Ravens Bluff when they came across the Ghostly Palace. They were amazed by its presence, as its size would have required years of construction and yet they had just camped to the right of the pass but a few weeks ago. The messenger left their horse to graze in the [[grass]] as they approached to investigate the structure, but was forced to crawl back to their horse after being attacked at its front gate a [[varrdig]], one of the creatures that had been unleashed by the ''iron flasks''. A few days later, the messenger finally returned to Ravens Bluff and reported his encounter. The Lord Mayor in turn reported this to the [[Ministry of Magic]] on a sheet of [[parchment]], entrusting them to look into the matter and take whatever steps were necessary to remove the palace and its mysterious snow attacker.\n\nFinding themselves unable to scry inside the palace, Ambassador [[Carrague]] assembled a group of around five to eight [[adventurer]]s, whom had all been recommended to him by Chief Constable [[Rolf Sunriver]], to ride out and investigate. He tasked them with discovering how the palace got there, who owned it, and if possible bring the owner back to the Ministry so that they could question them, impose fines, and possibly take action against them. The adventurers rode off on horses provided to them, encountering the rumored bandits and [[griffin]]s along the way.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|10-14}} Outside the palace, they fought off three varrdigs, before being greeted by Zuelia. Eager to receive visitors, the djinn wave her hands and manifested next to the fountain a table spread of fresh steamed [[fish]], recently picked sweet [[prune]]s, [[butter]]-topped [[bread]], and goblets of fruit juice.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|16}}\n\nZuelia regaled the adventurers with the details they sought, of the palace's curse, the couple's wayfaring life, and the broken ''iron flasks'' she had learned of from a bandit. She then professed that the two were planning to only stay for one more day, leaving the next dawn for the land of [[Kara-Tur]]. She then invited the adventurers inside to meet her husband and magically dressed them extravagant attire befitting [[Zakhara]]. Gorar was equally pleased to have visitors and asked with great interest for them to tell him all they could about the Vast, but Zuelia suggested that her husband engage the adventurers to an archery contest. Delighted by the idea, Gorar led them to the palace's inner courtyard, where an array of [[target]]s and wooden [[bow]]s stood ready for them, and wagered either a [[ruby]] [[ring]] worth 15,000 [[gold piece]]s if they could best him or simply that amount of coins. All the while, Gorar expounded upon his many travels and eventually they were asked to leave.\n\nSome sources spoke of the couple flying away as the adventurers tried to apprehend Gorar, whilst others claimed the two groups departed amicably and that the Ghostly Palace disappeared from the trail soon after. In its wake, the heavy structure left a huge square depression upon the ground and trail that would require fixing at a later date.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/A Snowball's Chance|20}}"
