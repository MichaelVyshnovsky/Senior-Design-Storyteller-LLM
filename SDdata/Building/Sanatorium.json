        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The dark and cold feeling of the Sanatorium lent to an atmosphere that more resembled a dungeon or prison, rather than a place of care and convalescence."
        },
        "Services": "For many years, the Sanatorium offered healing and housing for those spellscarred who suffered from any form of insanity or physical ailments brought upon by the lingering effects of the [[Spellplague]]. It was staffed by [[Helmite]] priests that dedicated themselves to the care of these unfortunate souls.\n\nWhen the Prophet [[Rohini]] emerged as a leader in Helm's Hold, she championed the cause of offering care for the city's spellscarred. She was aided in her efforts by a trusted [[goliath]] named [[Torlgar]], who served as the Sanatorim's warden.\n\nSome patients that were considered relatively healthy aided in the upkeep and maintenance of Helm's cathedral. Every patient was allowed to leave their underground domain once each day and walk the undergrounds under close scrutiny by the priests.",
        "History": "During the 1470s DR, the Prophet Rohini began experimenting on the very same people she swore to care for within the Sanatorium, even transforming some into [[foulspawn]] abominations. Her atrocities continued when she allowed the [[Ashmadai]] to sacrifice the patients in the [[ritual]]s they used to conjure forth [[devil]]s from the [[Nine Hells]].\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Rohini secluded herself within the Cathedral of Helm and surrounded her Ashmadai cultists and devilish allies. Aided by the creature known as [[Hexabaal|Hexabaal the Seer]], the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] ventured into the Sanatorium by means of a secret entrance and and slew the warden Torlgar, before breaking through into the cathedral itself confronting Rohini herself."
