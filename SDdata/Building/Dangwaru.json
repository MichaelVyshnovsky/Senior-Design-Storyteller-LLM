        "mainbody": "'''Dangwaru''' (Typhoon Palace) was a palace built on the [[Snout of Omgar]] by the [[tortle]]s to make the crew of a wrecked ship feel at home in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the palace was dilapidated and haunted. Young tortles went to the palace to find treasure but were quickly scared away.\n\n\n\nThe captain of the ship was a [[human]] female whom the tortles admired. She worshiped [[Umberlee]] and told the tortles stories of sea monsters that she'd fought. She supposedly died about fifty years after her arrival but was in fact transformed into a [[carrion crawler]] by Umberlee for an unknown slight."
