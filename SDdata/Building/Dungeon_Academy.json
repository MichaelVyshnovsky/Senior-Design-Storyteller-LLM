        "mainbody": "The Dungeon Academy was a secret school for monsters located somewhere in Faerûn.\nThe Dungeon Academy was located in the Veiled Mountains, which were in the Endless Woods, somewhere in Faerûn. It was  from Horntree Village.\nThe Dungeon Academy was an old building. Some parts of it were in poor condition. The first floor of the Academy was designed around a central corridor. Beneath that floor were the dungeon levels for classes and other activities. The floors were connected by a large spiral staircase. Below, the Academy was connected to volcanic pools of magma.\nThe Academy was filled with bats and old traps. while others were freezing cold. A large pendulum in the corridor was used to help mark the time. Some notable areas included\n* Goreball Pitch A grassy sporting field that lay outside. Students played the game goreball here.\n* Dining Chamber A room in which students ate meals like lunch. The students divided themselves up according to racial social groups.\n* The Hall of Eternal Suffering and Monotony A subterranean detention hall that was connected to the rest of the academy by a narrow bridge over a pool of magma.\n* The Lurkery A forest for students to practice their lurking in.\n* The Library An extensive six-story collection of all sorts of books.\n* The Deans Office A well-decorated room home to the Dean.\n* Dormitory A series of rooms in which some students lived.\nThe Academy trained young monsters in the ways of being monsters before they graduated and were ultimately sent out to dungeons. Introduction to Hoarding, Intro to Skulking, Taking Care of Your Hoard\nClasses were held in semesters. Some classes were known to issue homework, in the form of essays. Students were also sometimes sent out into the outside world to practice what they had learnt. Some students organized in clubs, such as the Lurking Club. Students whose parents were employed by the Academy stayed on school premises.\nThe Academy had a particularly strong school spirit, which manifested in support for their goreball team, the Dungeon Academy Flumphs. The Flumphs, named for the school mascot of the flumph, had an ongoing rivalry with the superior Waterdeep Dragons team. However, bullying was rampant at the school.\nThe rules of the school were outlined in The Dungeon Academy student handbook. The demilich Professor Gast was the only undead allowed on school premises. Kindness was also banned, and when exhibited, punishable by detention. Different professors took turns monitoring students in detention. The Academy had a school council that held votes to decide on school policies.\nThe Academy had an exchange program with slaadi from the plane of Limbo.\nThere was also a yearbook that assigned students positions such as least likely to change.\nThe academy was secret and well defended. The Endless Woods, which surrounded the mountains in which the academy was located, only allowed passage to those that it deemed worthy, such as students of the Academy.\nThe Academy had existed for over 200 years. Its school mascot had previously been a bulette, until 200 years ago it was changed to the flumph after a bulette attack.\nThe human barbarian Mad Smithy had in the past tried to take the Academy. He died in the process, but his greataxe remained as the pendulum for the clock in the corridor on the first floor. \nOne winter, the necromancer Lord Carrion used magic to take control of some students who had been sent on an excursion to Horntree Village. He was stopped by the newly formed Danger Club and the adventurer Allidora Steelstrike.\nThe Academy taught students of a variety of monstrous races including slaadi, gnolls, dao, myconids, mimics, owlbears, oozes, kuo-toa, goblins, bugbears and flail snails. The staff of the Academy were equally varied and strange.\nIt should be noted that some of these creatures, like owlbears and oozes, are normally non-intelligent and therefore incapable of learning.\n* Zellidora Stormclash, a human who disguised herself as a minotaur.\n* Hugo, an owlbear.\n* Bauble, a mimic.\n* Snabla, a kobold.\n* Gixi, a slaad.\n* Jizek, a dao.\n* Gutrash, a goblin.\n* Patty, a bugbear.\n* Bloppy, an ooze.\n* Dean Zxaticus, a beholder.\n* Professor Gast, a hobgoblin demilich who taught History of Horrible Humans.\n* Professor Kifin Stormclash, a minotaur who taught Goreball.\n* Professor Cantrip, a gelatinous cube that had merged with the intelligence of an alchemist it had half-digested.\n* Professor Impro Vice, a mimic professor of alchemy.\n* Professor Viletongue, a night hag.\n* Professor Screamshatter, who taught Intro to Skulking.\n* Nihildris, a mind flayer counsellor.\n* Shinka Bookbinder, a winged kobold librarian.\n* Mavis, a fire elemental cook.\nThe blink dog Flash was also brought to the Academy by the Danger Club."
