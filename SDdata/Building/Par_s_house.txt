Pars house was a house in the Mere of Dead Men.
Pars house was located near Edarios forge.
Like the other houses in Highcliff, Pars house was made from stone, wood and straw.
The interior of the house is nicely made, with luxurious drawers, carpets, tables and other furniture. In addition, the containers hold gems, potions, gold etc.
Par asked of the Kalach-Cha to enter his house and see what is inside. The Kalach-Cha would encounter some angry sailors, led by Dulahey, who would attack. After the situation has been taken care of, Par would give away some potions and enter his house to clean the mess up.
