        "mainbody": "The '''Risen Moon Market''' was a grocery in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was known as the best place for produce in town.",
        "Location": "It lay near the center of the city and stood opposite the [[High Lord's Hall]].",
        "Services": "It sold fresh crops from farms in all seasons but winter. The store also grew [[mushroom]]s in the cellar. These were available at all times of the year and had a delicious, smokey taste.\n\nPerhaps unusually, on each [[Shieldmeet]], the Risen Moon Market was also traditionally where the ceremony for selecting the [[Green Regent]]—a [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]]—and the attendant [[Scions of the Green Regent]] was held. All who would volunteer for the role gathered here and the first part of the ritual was conducted by the [[druid]]s of the [[Circle of the Stag]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}<ref group=\"note\">While ''Volo's Guide to the North'' clearly describes the Risen Moon Market as a grocer's shop, and ''The North'' reprints this, the ''Legacy of the Green Regent'' apparently misinterprets it as a large open-air market, as the name suggests and as would be suitable for such a ceremony.",
        "History": "It was in business by [[1366 DR]] and continued through [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn Shieldmeet of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, it was again the place where the next Green Regent was chosen."
