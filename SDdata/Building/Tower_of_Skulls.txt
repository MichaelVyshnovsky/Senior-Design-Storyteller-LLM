The '''Tower of Skulls''' was an abbey and the major center of worship for the [[church of Kelemvor]].

==Location==
The abbey was located in [[Ormath]], a small city on the south-eastern edge of the [[Shining Plains]].

==Structure==
The abbey was a ziggurat, with the exterior walls covered in carvings of [[human]] skulls.

==Interior==
The interior of the abbey comprised rooms connected by spiraling corridors.

Beneath the abbey, massive cellars extended deep into the earth. The cellars connected to an underground river and several caverns. Within the caverns, the clerics grew a type of edible fungi.

==Activities==
The clerics, using the edible fungi grown deep under the abbey, made a potent [[wine]] that was amber in color. They also created perfumes, unguents, and [[potion]]s from the fungi, which were sold to outsiders.

==Defenses==
The abbey was defended by the battle-hardened clerics, who used magical items and weapons in defense of the abbey.

==Inhabitants==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the abbey and its clergy were commanded by the High Lord Doom [[Bezurgathan Indraeyan]].

Guardian creatures, resembling [[will-o'-wisp]]s, roamed the corridors of the abbey.
