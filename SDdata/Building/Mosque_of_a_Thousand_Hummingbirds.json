        "mainbody": "The Mosque of a Thousand Hummingbirds was a temple in Dihliz dedicated to the worship of Selan in 1367 DR.\nThis impressive house of worship had many tiers and towers. Beautiful flowers and pomegranate trees filled the numerous balconies and ledges. Hummingbirds and winged serpents attended the lively vegetation of the ledges and the gardens below.\nThe Mosque was directly supported by the court in Afyal. Because of the rather loose judiciary system found in Dihliz, the priests and priestesses of Selan often held positions of authority."
