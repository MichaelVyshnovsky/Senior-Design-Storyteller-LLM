        "Description": "This impressive house of worship had many tiers and towers. Beautiful flowers and [[pomegranate]] trees filled the numerous balconies and ledges. Hummingbirds and [[winged serpent]]s attended the lively vegetation of the ledges and the gardens below.",
        "Activities": "The Mosque was directly supported by the court in [[Afyal]]. Because of the rather loose judiciary system found in Dihliz, the priests and priestesses of Selan often held positions of authority."
