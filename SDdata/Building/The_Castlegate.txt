The Castlegate was located in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
The interior was big and richly furnished, with lofty windows. Despite its name, it had no view of Castle Waterdeep.
The atmosphere in the inn was described as impersonal, clean, and formal. It catered mostly to wealthier travelers and middle class Waterdhavian residents.
The tenday rate for a shared room included watered down wine, three meals a day, and a cold bath every three nights. Patrons could pay extra for hot water to bathe in.
In addition to rooms for rent, the Castlegate had a large dining room on the first floor, which served hot tea.
