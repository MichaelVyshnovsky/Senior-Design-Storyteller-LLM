==Location==
The Castlegate was located in the [[Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Interior==
The interior was big and richly furnished, with lofty windows. Despite its name, it had no view of [[Castle Waterdeep]].

===Atmosphere===
The atmosphere in the inn was described as impersonal, clean, and formal. It catered mostly to wealthier travelers and middle class Waterdhavian residents.

==Services==
The tenday rate for a shared room included watered down [[wine]], three meals a day, and a cold bath every three nights. Patrons could pay extra for hot water to bathe in.
In addition to rooms for rent, the Castlegate had a large dining room on the first floor, which served hot [[tea]].
