The '''Crossing Inn''' was an inn on the [[Phlan Path]],{{Cite adventurers league/Drums in the Marsh|7}} the road that stretched between the town of [[Phlan]], and the city of [[Melvaunt]]. It was named for its proximity to the Trank River Bridge, which crossed the [[Trank River]] where the waterway met the Phlan Path.

==Location==
The inn was located on the east side of the Trank River, just south of the Phlan Path.

==Structure==
The Inn was a single-story octagonal building whose roof was faceted along all eight of the building's walls, tapering high above until it met a central stone chimney. A small dock on the east bank of the river allowed keelboats to moor up close by the inn.

==Interior==
Inside was a large common room. Several tables were available for dining, and one particularly large table was used for meetings.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Suits of the Mists|8}} There were no beds, but there was easily enough space on the floor for 50 people to sleep.

==Defenses==
Short perimeter walls surrounding the main structure provided some defense. [[Romsan]], the inn's proprietor and a capable former adventurer, was capable of defending his business.

==History==
The Crossing Inn was a popular place for travellers to stay in the late 15th century DR. It was a place where people could come and learn the latest news from all along the northern shore of the [[Moonsea]]. In [[1489 DR]], Romsan sent a call out to adventurers to help him save more than forty people who had been abducted over the past week. The following winter, after Phlan fell to [[Vorgansharax|The Maimed Virulence]], The Inn's reputation as a rumor hub became important to those trying to retake Phlan as those who frequented the place belived that something worse was coming.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Suits of the Mists|7}}

==Inhabitants==
[[Romsan Kal]] was a former adventurer who ran the inn as its proprietor. He had a small staff working under him.
