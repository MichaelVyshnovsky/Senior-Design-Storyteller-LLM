        "mainbody": "he House of Tarmagus was a warehouse located in Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe House of Tarmagus was a storehouse that allowed third-parties to rent storage space for a reasonable fee and with confidence that their goods would be kept well-guarded and protected from the elements. It only permitted \"dry, non-living, and never-living items\".\nThe business boasted the claim of being one of the only such facilities in Waterdeep not affiliated with or under the control of a syndicate like the Xanathars Thieves Guild (and continued support from Masked Lords, Open Lords, and the Blackstaff kept it this way over the decades). \nThe building stood four stories tall. The Keelhauled Dwarf tavern was located beneath the cellar of the House of Tarmagus. Constantly running pumps in a corner of the House kept the tavern dry.\nThe House of Tarmagus was located in the southeast section of the Dock Ward in a neighborhood bordered by Keel Alley to the southwest, Net Street to the southeast, and Pressbow Lane to the northeast.\nThe House of Tarmagus was founded by Eaerdran Tarmagus in the , a businessman who perceived that no existing warehouses in the Dock Ward were \"doing things right\" by not cracking down on things like water damage and theft. Despite numerous attempts by rivals to shut him down—including arson, raids, and a group of duergar and half-orcs who threatened him in his bedchamber—the business made him very wealthy. He ultimately bequeathed his businesses to a number of retired adventurers who had become his partners (both in commerce and romance), and they and their descendants continued to run the House through the late 15 century DR."
