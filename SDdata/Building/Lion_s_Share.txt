'''The Lion's Share''' was a store in [[Triboar]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

It was recently purchased and refurbished by the [[Lionshield Coster]] company by [[1485 DR]]. The company's trademark, a polished [[shield]] emblazoned with the head of a stylized [[gold]]en [[lion]] over a blue background hung above the store's entrance.

[[Narth Tezrin]] and [[Alaestra Ulgar]] ran the business and were paid well by the company.
