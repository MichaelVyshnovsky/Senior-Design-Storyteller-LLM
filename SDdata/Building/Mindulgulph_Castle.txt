Mindulgulph Castle was a large keep or castle in the hills south of Priapurl on the Dragon Coast. It sat atop a pinnacle that overlooked the town. It became the base of the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company.
In the early 1340s DR, an adventuring company including Gayrlana raided Mindulgulph Castle and discovered a number of intelligent, "monstrous", creatures dwelling inside. However, rather than slaying them as many adventurers would, they instead recruited the majority of them to their side. Gayrlana soon reformed the group into the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company, and they took the castle as their base.
In the 1360s DR, Gayrlana led much of her company hundreds of miles from home to the Eastern Shaar, where they took an extended contract with the gold dwarves of the Great Rift. The remainder of the company remained in Priapurl and guarded Mindulgulph Castle.
It was well guarded by a number of the companys more monstrous members.
