The Tumbling Goblets was a gnome-run festhall in Skultan, Sembia, that was in existence in 1368 DR.
It was staffed by attractive human females, and was home to underhanded dealings. A rumor existed that Purple Dragons would permit these dealings to continue, accepting bribes in the form of discounted "services."
