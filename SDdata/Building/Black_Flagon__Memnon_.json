        "mainbody": "The Black Flagon was a popular tavern in Memnon, Calimshan, owned and staffed by a family of sprites.\nThe tavern was located in the middle of Memnon, right on the shore of the River Agis.\nThe Black Flagon was a classic tavern in many respects softly lit, smoky, and with a low-beamed ceiling and heavy, battered wooden furniture.\nAlthough the Flagon was anything but a quiet tavern, with little privacy to be had, it was a popular meeting place.\nPrices at the Black Flagon were somewhat more expensive than the norm, made up for in part by the swift and energetic sprite staff.\nThe sprites had several magic items concealed within the tavern to facilitate the removal of unruly guests and also had an adventuring troupe named the Flagon Five on their payroll for protection.\nAlthough it was not common knowledge that the Black Flagon was owned by sprites, patrons were careful to avoid insulting the staff lest they be kicked out."
