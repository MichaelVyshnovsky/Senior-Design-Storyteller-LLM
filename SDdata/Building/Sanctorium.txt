'''The Sanctorium''' was the grand library of [[Myth Drannor]], located in the city during its glory days before the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|76}}

==Location==
It was located in the district of [[Sheshyrinnam]], on the corner of [[Moonopal Way]] and [[Elbansyr's Ride]].{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves/Map}}

==Structure==
The above-ground structure of the Sanctorium was a white marble building surrounded by wide-set stone stairs. Its outer walls were decorated with elaborate frescoes and sculptures that depicted the daily life found in Myth Drannor. The fa√ßade was altered every year by means of magic to show new scenes that occurred the year prior.

Beneath the library hall were five subterranean levels that housed its grand collection of documents.

==Interior==
Within the marble structure of the Sanctorium was a vast hall that featured statues that depicted [[elves]], [[human]]s, [[dwarves]] and the other races that took up residence within Myth Drannor.

==Services==
A single figure sat at a lone desk within the hall to greet visitors and retrieve [[book]]s and documents from within the Sanctorium's vaults. The true breadth of information found within the vaults was unknown to all. While petitioners were seldom denied a specific tome, no one was fully aware of everything it had to offer.

The only other people allowed within the vaults were the city's [[elven high mage|high mages]] and those spellcasters who had graduated from [[Windsong Tower]].
