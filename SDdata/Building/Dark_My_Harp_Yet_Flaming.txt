Dark my Harp yet Flaming was a tavern in Suzail during the late 14 century DR.
Once a grand mansion, the place had grown ramshackle as additional wings had been built around it.
The place had at least two flights of stairs.
The small windows of the building were suitable for lookouts. At least one half-orc carried a unique handbow, which appeared to shoot six bolts at once.
The crowded establishment was dimly lit, but cozy and quiet.
At some point after the start of spring in the , the spy Narnra Shalace visited Dark my Harp yet Flaming while doing reconnaissance and intelligence work for Caladnei.
