'''Dark my Harp yet Flaming''' was a tavern in [[Suzail]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
Once a grand mansion, the place had grown ramshackle as additional wings had been built around it.

==Interior==
The place had at least two flights of stairs.

==Defenses==
The small windows of the building were suitable for lookouts. At least one [[half-orc]] carried a unique [[handbow]], which appeared to shoot six bolts at once.

==Atmosphere==
The crowded establishment was dimly lit, but cozy and quiet.

==History==
At some point after the start of spring in the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, the spy [[Narnra Shalace]] visited Dark my Harp yet Flaming while doing reconnaissance and intelligence work for [[Caladnei]].
