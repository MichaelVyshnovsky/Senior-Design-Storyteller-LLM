        "mainbody": "'''Griffonwatch Keep''' was a fortification in the town of [[Hulburg]] on the [[Moonsea]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The castled glowered over the town of Hulburg, a mile from the harbor, perched atop a rocky spur of the eastern ridge.\n\nThe keep took advantage of the geology of Hulburg and used cliffs on three sides as walls. There was a large curtain wall in front of the keep with a causeway leading to the entrance of the complex.",
        "Activities": "It was the home of the ruling [[Hulmaster]] family beginning sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR. In the late 15{{th}} century DR, it was also used for the training and barracks of the [[Shieldsworn]] and a place of refuge when the town was in danger of attack. While it was not very well situated to guard the city against attacks by sea, it faced north, inland, serving as a defense against the savage [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and other monsters who dwelt in the desolate hills and moorlands of [[Thar]].",
        "History": "The Hulmaster family originally called home a smallish and drab castle called Hullmaster Keep, also known as [[Daggergard]], until sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, when Griffonwatch was built by [[Angar Hulmaster]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[Sergen Hulmaster]]&mdash;a Hulmaster by adoption, rather than blood&mdash;summoned a small army of [[wight]]s and similar [[undead]] to the castle, hoping to kill his family and blame their deaths on [[Aesperus]], the King in Copper, so that he could become lord of the town. His plan failed, however, as the Hulmasters all escaped, thanks in large part to [[Geran Hulmaster]], [[Hamil Alderheart]], and [[Sarth Khul Riizar]], who battled first the undead and then the [[House Veruna]] guards hired by Sergen to contain them within the castle."
