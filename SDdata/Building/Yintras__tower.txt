'''Yintras' tower''' was the abode of [[Yintras Bedelmrin]] in the mid–8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The tower was located far from the [[Castle of the Lady]], and farther still from [[Holivanter's Tower]],

The tower was in the middle of the wilderness, far from villages and paths.

==Structure==
The tower was modest, made of rough stone. It had shuttered windows, with boxes of hanging herbs on the sills; the plants included hanging [[rose]]s and [[ivy|ivies]].

==Interior==
One of the rooms, which had a shuttered window, led to another room that stored books and scrolls. There was a spiral staircase at the heart of the tower. There was a room at the top of the tower, which had a door leading to the staircase.

==Defenses==
The room at the top of the tower had several magical wards.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|764}}, the mage [[Yintras Bedelmrin]] prayed to [[Azuth]] for guidance on who to bequeath his sorcerous knowledge, just before he was attacked by a mysterious apparition later known as [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]]. Azuth fortified him against it, allowing him to force the Slayer into flight.
