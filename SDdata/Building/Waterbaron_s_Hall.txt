The '''Waterbaron's Hall''' was a palace used by the eponymous ruler of [[Yartar]]. It served as their personal residence and the site where they held open court.

==Location==
It was located in the center of Yartar, near the central marketplace and several prominent establishments. The [[Fishyard]] was situated just in front of its entrance.

==Exterior==
A number of [[lion]] statues, carved from stone, decorated the exterior of the Waterbaron's Hall. These were in fact elaborately decorated stocks used to hold prisoners in between their punishments.

Unlike the rest of the city, which was traditionally kept dark at night, the outside of the Waterbaron's Hall was illuminated with a number of torches.

==Structure==
The palace itself featured a number of columns that held up its overhanging, gable style roof. The chambers within were quite spacious, carrying the voices of anyone inside.

==Interior==
Its interior was decorated with [[marble]] sculptures and fine tapestries.

==Activities==
Beyond the Waterbaron, a number of Yartarran merchants were granted residence within the palace.

It also served as a feasting hall, on occasions when the Waterbaron hosted influential guests. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], individuals who worked alongside the [[Lords' Alliance]] were readily welcome within the Waterbaron's Hall.

==Defenses==
The Waterbaron's Hall was protected by a [[ward]] that prevented anyone within from having their blood shed. As such, most of those within wielded [[mace]]s or some form of [[magic]].
