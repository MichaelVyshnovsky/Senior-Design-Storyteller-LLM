The '''Wailing Wheel''' was an [[inn]] found immediately to the south from [[Suzail]]'s the [[Horngate]].

==Location==
The inn stood where the steep-angled [[Windever Street]] merged into Suzail's grand [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]]. The inn's main entrance opened to the view of the city's Horngate.

==Interior==
Despite being quite large, the establishment was considered to be one of the lesser known and hence the quietest inns in the capital of Cormyr. Despite its low quality, the Wheel got enough business due to its location and low prices. Most of the time it had available rooms, apart from the festival dates. The inn's building was solidly built, offering protection from the Promenade's noise or sounds of fellow guests.

==Services==
The Wailing Wheel's accommodations were relatively fair, and the prices were cheap, the building was cold and far from being the cleanest place in town. Overall service was very poor. A popular deal offered by the Wheel was a three-night stay for only five [[gold]] [[coin]] (additional [[silver]] per animal kept in the inn's stables or per additional guest).

The meager food served at the Wailing Wheel mostly consisted of thick oily stews, toasted [[bread]]s topped with melted yet lackluster [[cheese]]s, as well as watered down [[ale]]s.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Wailing Wheel was owned by a merchant, prosperous landlord, and investor named [[Thentias]] who did business in [[Sembia]] and Cormyr. During that time, the inn's staff never lasted longer than a single season, likely evidence of poor pay.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|74-75}}
