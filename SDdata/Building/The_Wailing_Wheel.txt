The Wailing Wheel was an inn found immediately to the south from Suzails the Horngate.
The inn stood where the steep-angled Windever Street merged into Suzails grand Promenade. The inns main entrance opened to the view of the citys Horngate.
Despite being quite large, the establishment was considered to be one of the lesser known and hence the quietest inns in the capital of Cormyr. Despite its low quality, the Wheel got enough business due to its location and low prices. Most of the time it had available rooms, apart from the festival dates. The inns building was solidly built, offering protection from the Promenades noise or sounds of fellow guests.
The Wailing Wheels accommodations were relatively fair, and the prices were cheap, the building was cold and far from being the cleanest place in town. Overall service was very poor. A popular deal offered by the Wheel was a three-night stay for only five gold coin (additional silver per animal kept in the inns stables or per additional guest).
The meager food served at the Wailing Wheel mostly consisted of thick oily stews, toasted breads topped with melted yet lackluster cheeses, as well as watered down ales.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Wailing Wheel was owned by a merchant, prosperous landlord, and investor named Thentias who did business in Sembia and Cormyr. During that time, the inns staff never lasted longer than a single season, likely evidence of poor pay.
