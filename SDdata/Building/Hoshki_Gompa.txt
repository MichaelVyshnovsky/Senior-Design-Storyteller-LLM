'''Hoshki Gompa''' was a monastery (a gompa in the [[Tabotan language]]) of the [[Way of Enlightenment]] in [[Tabot]].

==Geography==
It stood in the [[Po Yul Dzayul Range]], near the [[Marnu Cliffs]] from which the [[Nam River]] issued and overlooking the trails down to the [[Wohani River]].

==History==
It was founded some time between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}, when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in [[Shou Lung]] and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Hoshki.

==Relations==
The monks of Hoshki Gompa were often in conflict with the people of Phutan.
