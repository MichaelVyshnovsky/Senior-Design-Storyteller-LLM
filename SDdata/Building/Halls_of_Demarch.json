        "mainbody": "The Halls of Demarch was a guildhall in the city of Tantras in the Vast in north Faer没n. It served as headquarters to Demarchs Alliance and later Demarchs Folly.\nThe Halls of Demarch was a secret guildhall, hidden beneath the city of Tantras. It consisted of a subterranean complex and a network of tunnels.\nThe tunnels of the Halls of Demarch were permanently filled with fog and haunted by shadows, other kinds of undead, and other monsters. These were a byproduct of the Battle of Demarchs Fall.\nThe Halls of Demarch were once home to Demarchs Alliance between beguilers who served Leira and those who served Mask.\nBut after Mask betrayed Leira in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the alliance was broken and the two factions fought a massive battle in their former headquarters, the Battle of Demarchs Fall. The rival beguilers fought a number of bloody skirmishes through the tunnels, all concealed in mists. An enormous amount of magic was cast, resulting in the opening of a rift to the Plane of Shadow. Shadows and various other monsters fell out of the rift, along with several magic items and the tome of Suelivain. The Maskarran and Leiran beguilers slaughtered each other.\nThe survivors fled across Faer没n, living in fear of revenge attacks and church agents seeking to learn or maintain their secrets. A few friendly ex-members, however, returned to the Halls of Demarch, believing the safest place to hide was the last place they were expected. They reformed into a new organization, taking the name Demarchs Folly, and learned shadow magic from the book of Suelivain.\nThe Halls of Demarch were the headquarters of both Demarchs Alliance and Demarchs Folly.\nCategoryGuildhalls\nCategoryLocations in Tantras\nCategoryLocations in the Vast\nCategoryLocations in North Faer没n\nCategoryLocations in Faer没n\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nh4q1gvejt8a831pllv85w2z9i7c053l"
