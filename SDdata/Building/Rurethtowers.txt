'''Rurethtowers''' was a castle in the north-western part of [[Sembia]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-11-28 - Rurethtowers}}

==Location==
Situated within a woodland populated by [[stag]]s, the castle stood east of the northernmost edge of the [[Arch Wood]], right across the border into Sembia.

==Structure==
The castle of Rurethtowers was made of [[stone]] and had four towers. The castle's substantial cellars prompted speculations of its potential connection to the [[Underdark]]. Though there was no evidence, the connection was possible through the cellar's intersecting with underground passages.

==History==
For years Rurethtowers drew adventurers hoping to discover the hidden bandit treasure said to be concealed within the castle's walls.

In the 1460s [[DR]], treasure-hunters began vanishing, reportedly pursued by some monsters lurking within Rurethtowers. According to different reports, it was possible that the place was inhabited by more than one type of dangerous creatures.
