The Broken Harp was a tavern in the Amnian city of Esmeltaran during the 14 century DR.
The tavern was built right on the western edge of Esmeltaran next to Lake Esmel.
The Broken Harp provided relatively poor service for its middling prices. It was a popular meeting spot for anyone who considered themselves an enemy of the Harpers.
