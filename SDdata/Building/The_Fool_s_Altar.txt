The Fools Altar was a small shrine dedicated to Finder Wyvernspur, the Nameless Bard, located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the 15 century DR.
The Fools Altar stood just south of Ascloakans Fine Inn, along Hammaskarls Ride, a street that began at the citys easternmost gate—the Basilisk Gate—and curved south then ran north
The shrine was tended by a finhead saurial cleric named Aszloakh the Hooded in the late 15 century DR, who was known for his patience, calm, and cynical good humor.
