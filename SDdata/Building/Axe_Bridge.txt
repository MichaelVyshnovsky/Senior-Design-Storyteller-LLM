The Axe Bridge, originally named the Clan Kuldelver Bridge, was an ancient dwarven bridge that spanned the Splendarrllur river in the eastern reaches of Amn.
The bridge carried the Eshpurta Road over the Splendarrllur, positioned a little under halfway from Keczulla to Eshpurta. The similar Star Bridge lay further to the west towards Keczulla.
The Axe Bridge was a massive stonewrought structure that spanned the widest possible floodheight of the Splendarrllur, and it was of identical design to the Star Bridge. It was built of extraordinarily resilient stonework, such that by the 14 century DR it bore only the slightest traces of wear and tear, mostly from recent heavy cart traffic. It was decorated with the heavily faded runes for Clan Kuldelver Bridge on the railing stones, with the axe symbol granting it its later name.
The bridge was built around  by the dwarves of the High Shanataran realm of Korolnor as part of their great network of surface projects. It was inscribed with the name Clan Kuldelver Bridge, after the dwarves that built it.
Long after the fall of Shanatar, humans from Calimshan settled the region and discovered the twin bridges. With little dwarfcraft to compare to, the true origins of the Kuldelver bridge went largely unknown, though they were widely used by travelers. Only the careful examination by scholars and dwarves of the bridges eroded runes eventually revealed the fact that the bridges had originated in the ancient dwarven ages, built by Clan Kuldelver.
During the 14 century DR, the Axe Bridge marked the eastern extent of the Council Army patrol from Keczulla.
