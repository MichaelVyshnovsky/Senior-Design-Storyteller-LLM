The '''Palace of Many Spires''' was the home of the Ransar of the city-state of [[Innarlith]] on the [[Lake of Steam]]. It was one of the most prominent landmarks in the city.<ref>

==Location==
It was located in the wealthy second quarter of Innarlith near the [[Chamber of Law and Civility]], the legislative body of Innarlith.<ref>

==Structure==
As its name suggests, its architecture included large spires that were visible from other parts of the city.<ref>

==Activities==
The Ransar was the title for the leader of the city-state of Innarlith. The Ransar was not a permanent position, but was elected by the [[senate of Innarlith]]. The palace served as the home and office of the Ransar.<ref>

==History==
An additional spire was added to the palace in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, in order to house visiting foreign dignitaries. The spire was designed by [[Ivar Devorast]], but he was not given credit for it.<ref>

Ransar [[Osorkon]] was assassinated in the palace in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, when Senator [[Salatis]] overthrew him.<ref>
