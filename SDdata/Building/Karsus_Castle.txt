Karsus Castle was the palatial home of Karsus, the archmage of Eileanar enclave.
The Castle was on a small mount near the middle of the city, overlooking the League of Noted Singers and Performers and Constabulary Branch One.
The palace was as elaborate and fantastical as any other structure in Karsus, with features such as an internal portal network, locally altered gravity planes , and miraculously self-supporting delicate architecture.
