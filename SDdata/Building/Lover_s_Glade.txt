The '''Lover's Glade''' was a small glade that served as place of worship for [[Sune]], and to a lesser extent [[Hanali Celanil]], found just beyond the city of [[Myth Drannor]] in the forest of [[Cormanthor]].

==Description==
Sune's protection extended over the glade, preventing any predatory creatures from stepping into its grounds during hours of darkness.

Illumination of the glade was provided by ''[[dancing lights]]'' and ''[[faerie fire]]'' spells that were modified so as to be permanent and non-harmful to passersby.

==Location==
It was situated along a stream at north side of the city's borders, just within it's protective ''[[mythal]]''.

==Structure==
The Lover's Glade comprised small pool was set into the ground, encircled by a ring of ascending steps. Great truse lay at the bottom of the lake, some {{SI|90|ft}} beneath the earth.

A shrine to Hanali Celanil was located within the glade.

==Rumors & Legends==
Local legend said that some aquatic being guarded the treasure found at the bottom of the lake, speculated to be a [[spectator]].
