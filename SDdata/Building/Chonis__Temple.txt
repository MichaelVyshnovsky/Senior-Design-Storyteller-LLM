'''Chonis' Temple''' was the name given to a ruined structure in western Cormyr. It lay east of [[Eagle Peak]], in the foothills of the [[Stormhorns]].

The ruins were thought to have once been a temple, and prominently bore the name "Chonis", written in the [[Thorass alphabet]], a feature it shared with the [[Tomb of Chonis]]. Hence, it was called "Chonis' Temple". None knew who or what [[Chonis]] was, however; some speculated it was a long-forgotten deity, demigod, or fiend.
