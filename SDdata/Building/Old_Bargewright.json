        "Location": "It stood in the eastern upper part of the settlement, on the eastern end of the road known as the Rise, neighboring [[Ruldarr's Pipes, Locks, Tobacco, and Fine Furniture]] and [[Rintharr]]'s house. Prior to the growth of the settlement around it, it had stood alone atop a natural hill to the nearby village of [[Womford]] that it overlooked and the beginning of the [[Iron Road]].",
        "Structure": "[[File:Bargewright Inn.png|thumb|left|250px|''A view of the settlement, with the two towers and the Old Bargewright visible in the distance.'']]\n''Circa'' 1365 DR, the building was sturdy and unremarkable and constructed largely of wood. It was rather like a fortification with its two lookout towers: the North Tower was taller and slender, while the South Tower was wider but leaning, and both gave grand views over the grasslands of the [[Dessarin Valley]]. Each winter through the 1360s DR, Feston rebuilt the wooden parts in stonework, so it appeared ever more like a small castle.\n\nBy the 1490s DR, the inn and towers had been wholly rebuilt in stone, becoming a much larger structure with thick walls.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "Naturally, the Bargewright Inn was the heart of the community for the people of the namesake settlement."
        },
        "Defenses": "In addition to the two lookout towers, peace in the inn in the 1360s DR was maintained by four guards, all strong warriors. Furthermore, [[Aldon Bargewright]], the stablemaster and Feston's brother, also led the local militia.",
        "Services": "Service here was fast, efficient, and straightforward, lacking embellishments but not without its charms in [[Volo]]'s eyes.\n\nFor rooms, one could have a private room (bath included) at 1 [[gp]] per person, a double room at 5 [[sp]] per person, or a wardroom with six to eighteen bunks at 2 sp person, all per night. For 1 gp more, one could hire a chambermaid to assist with the bath, provide a back rub or foot rub on request, and even relate a short bedtime story or legend of the area.\n\nAs for food and drink, a talltankard of weak [[ale]] and a platter of [[biscuit]]s and very [[salt]]y [[pickle]]s were included in the room price. The huge [[pewter]] talltankards were twice the volume of a regular [[tankard]]. For main meals, there was only [[roasted beef]] or [[pork]] with lots of [[parsnip]]s, [[potato]]es, [[radish]]es, and [[turnip]]s; a tray with a fine selection of [[cheese]]s; and a vegetable and root sauce [[soup]] available in winter; these were plain yet hearty dishes. This meal was served any time from highsun to midnight for 5 [[cp]] per person, not including drinks.\n\nSuch drinks included a variety of [[beer]]s for 1 cp per tankard and a dry clear [[wine]] for 4 cp per tallglass, as well as [[sherry]] and [[Mintarn green wine]] both for 7 cp per tallglass or 1 sp per bottle (Volo presumed Feston stocked green wine because he had acquired a taste for it).",
        "History": "Once, this was but a simple wayside inn standing alone atop a hill beside the ford. However, after numerous attacks from bandits and brigands, Feston Bargewright, the innkeeper, elected to fortify the hill. This feat was accomplished with the help of several [[Waterdhavian]] merchants whom Feston had encouraged to join him to share the costs. Being weary of the politics and fees of the city's guilds, they came and established other businesses servicing the travelers and caravans passing through, giving rising to the community of the same name, which was well-established by [[1358 DR]].\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Though I meant to ask in Beliard after a cousin of mine who was passing this way, out of Noanar's Hold.

        "Inhabitants": "In the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the Bargewright Inn was owned and run by [[Feston Bargewright]], founder of the community.\n\nThe following century, in the 1480s DR, a descendent and namesake, [[Feston Bargewright (descendent)|Feston Bargewright]], remained as innkeeper.{{Cite dragon/430/The Harpers of Waterdeep|37}} However, with the majority of local business owners having financial dealings with the Zhents, by [[1491 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] had effectively taken over the settlement. and the Old Bargewright's innkeeper was now one [[Nalaskur Thaelond]]. The Zhentarim used its many private chambers to meet with their agents, spies, and mercenaries, usually to arrange illicit deals in contraband, [[poison]]s, and some kinds of [[magic]] in nearby Waterdeep. A permanent resident of the inn at the time was [[Arik Stillmarsh]], who lived as a recluse in a corner room of the top floor and the attic above, reached via a secret door in the ceiling of a closet."
