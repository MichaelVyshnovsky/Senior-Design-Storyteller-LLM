He murdered the crew of builders who had installed the collapsing ceiling with poisoned elverquisst and had Shrikegulk dispose of their bodies. He would later use it as the site of an ambush against Laeral Silverhand and was able to crush the Open Lord under the collapsing ceiling, however Laeral would later return in the body of Elminster. The building was completely destroyed in the magical battle that ensued, which involved Vajra Safahr, Qasmult, Glenmaur, and the returned Laeral."
