The '''House of Night''' was an underground temple of [[Shar]] found within the depths of the earth beneath [[Shadowdale]]. It was overseen by [[Esvele Greycastle]], a devoted Sharran servant that played a crucial role in the Lady's plans for [[Toril]] and [[the Weave]].

==Location==
The House of Night was hidden away at the bottom of the [[Dread Lair of Alokkair#Grinding Gulf|Grinding Gulf]] within the [[Dread Lair of Alokkkair]], carved beneath [[Fox Ridge]]. While the falling boulders of the grinding gulf formed a perilous pathway to the House's entrance chamber, the temple was accessible to those familiar with its layout by adjacent tunnels that bypassed the dangerous rockfalls of the gulf, one of which extended down to the [[drow]] settlement of [[Maerimydra]] beneath the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]].

A staircase leading from a tunnel northwest of the temple led to the [[Lich's Gauntlet]],

==Structure==
The chasm floor beneath the Grinding Gulf gave led towards a black stone doorway that gave entrance into the temple proper. It was flanked by a pair of finely-carved stone columns. The doorway to the House of Night featured the visage of a woman, half of which depicted her in her youth, the other as an old crone.

==Interior==
Just beyond the primary entrance was the Dark Lady's Foyer, a well-crafted receiving hall carved from [[basalt]], decorated with depictions of female figures in line with Sharran ornamentation. Set around the foyer were smaller chambers, including a guard barracks, a small room that housed a well fed by trickling water, and the temple's refectory.

The westernmost chamber of the temple housed the Shrine of Night, a place of meditation and worship for the Sharran clergy. It featured a large dais upon which stood a statue of Shar, her face shrouded by a hood and her form wielding dual [[dagger]]s crossed over her chest.

Just beyond Shar's shrine were the personal chambers of Priestess Esvele. She enjoyed a luxurious arrangement befitting for someone of her status within the [[church of Shar]].

===Atmosphere===
Much of the space within the House of Night was poorly illuminated, left in shadows to keep hidden the Sharran secrets. Within Shar's shrine, candles emitting dim green radiance shone upon black and purple tiles as well black stone marbled with [[gold]]. Unsettling [[Undead]] and ferocious [[fiend]]s roamed its halls as freely as Shar's faithful.

==Defenses==
The Dark Lady's Foyer was protected by a pair of [[mezzoloth]]s, commanded by Lady Esvele. ''[[Glyph of warding|Glyphs of warding]]'' were used throughout the temple's halls to protect locations critical to the Sharran plot.

==History==
During the month of [[Hammer]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, the Sharrans of the temple began performing the ''Rite of Unwinding'', a ritual that would dampen and even fully suppress the Weave across an ever-expanding field over the [[Dalelands]] and beyond.

Around that same time, the drow [[warmage]] [[Narhaun]] and his followers set up camp just outside the temple's entrance.
