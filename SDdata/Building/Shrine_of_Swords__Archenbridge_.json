        "mainbody": "The '''Shrine of Swords''' was a shrine to [[Tempus]] located in the town of [[Archenbridge]], in the [[Dalelands]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Shrine was located in the center courtyard of the fortress of [[Swordpoint]], which overlooked the [[River Arkhen]] and the town of Archenbridge.",
        "Structure": "This slim building had the appearance of a black, open-faced, spired [[helmet|helm]]. The spire and front arch of the shrine were made of interwoven and hammered [[sword]]s, [[shield]]s and [[armor]]s brought by worshipers as battle spoils. Those metallic decorations rusted regularly, causing the black paint to flake off the façade.",
        "Interior": "The shrine interior was fairly spartan, with simple furniture and simple sleeping cots for [[pilgrim]]s.",
        "Services": "Unlike other [[temple]]s, the Shrine only offered its services to [[Archendale]]'s warriors.  Adventurers, visitors and civilians looking religious assistance had to rely on other local temples, such as the [[Glory of the Morning]] or the [[Bounty of the Goddess (Archenbridge)|Bounty of the Goddess]]. \n\nIn addition to healing the temple provided several services to the faithful, such as prayers to ask for the Lord of Battles' favor, or selling the occasional [[healing potion]]. As payment for those services, the Battle-Chaplain asked for services and sent people on quests, such as climbing a dangerous mountain with minimal equipment, or killing a [[wyvern]] and bringing its head to the temple as offering to Tempus.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "An [[iron golem]] was stored behind the shrine. Rumors abounded, as it was unclear whether the golem was in working condition, or just used as decoration."
