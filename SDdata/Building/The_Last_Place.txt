The '''Last Place''' was the lone surviving [[ale]]-house in [[Yûlash]] around [[1367 DR]].

==Activities==
Business thrived at the Last Place because of a lack of competition and a surplus of soldiers quartered in the area. Despite the melting pot of customers, violence was kept to a minimum in the Last Place.

==Inhabitants==
The Last Place catered to [[Red Plumes]] from [[Hillsfar]], local citizens, angry faction members, and even the occasional [[Zhentarim]] spy.
