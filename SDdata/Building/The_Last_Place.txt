The Last Place was the lone surviving ale-house in YÃ»lash around 1367 DR.
Business thrived at the Last Place because of a lack of competition and a surplus of soldiers quartered in the area. Despite the melting pot of customers, violence was kept to a minimum in the Last Place.
The Last Place catered to Red Plumes from Hillsfar, local citizens, angry faction members, and even the occasional Zhentarim spy.
