        "Description": "The Bulwark was a pleasant and lively place, which drew in customers from within the Keep and from wider Suzail. It was a popular place to relax for the domestic staff of the Manor, and especially the [[Purple Dragons]] garrison who appreciated Haverish's service.",
        "Location": "The Bulwark was built into the Keep's wall, thus the name, and could be accessed from both sides of the wall.",

The inn's rooms were comfortable, and had beds for two people with enough space for two more on the floor. An underground storage cellar was also accessed from the ground floor. The tavern had an entrance from the outside of the Keep, which was how most public patrons entered. This door was attended by the bouncer [[Dwak]]. Opposite the public entry, a door led to the interior of the Keep, which was guarded by [[Louella Bonecracker]]",
