        "mainbody": "he Bubbling Bulwark was a tavern and inn attached to Thistleflame Keep, the estate of the noble Thistle family in Suzail. It was owned by the ex-Purple Dragon Haverish Hallefon.\nThe Bulwark was a pleasant and lively place, which drew in customers from within the Keep and from wider Suzail. It was a popular place to relax for the domestic staff of the Manor, and especially the Purple Dragons garrison who appreciated Haverishs service.\nThe Bulwark was built into the Keeps wall, thus the name, and could be accessed from both sides of the wall.\nThe Bulwark was a three-floor construction, with a tavern and common room on the ground floor and two floors of rented rooms above. The inns rooms were comfortable, and had beds for two people with enough space for two more on the floor. An underground storage cellar was also accessed from the ground floor.
