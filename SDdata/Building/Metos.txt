'''Metos''' was a fortress in the [[Methwood]] built by the [[Imaskari]] in {{Yearlink|-3234}}. It was made famous by [[Hilather]] and [[Madryoch]], who had their showdown in it.

==History==
Metos had, when created, sufficient extra-dimensional space to hold five-thousand soldiers and still be self-sufficient. It was very well protected against infiltration, as it required a ''portal key'' to access. The fortress was where Madryoch was confronted by a young Hilather, before being banished to the [[Demiplane of Imprisonment]].

However, the strength of the complex was never tested. [[Yuvaraj|Lord Yuvaraj]] recalled the forces from the complex to quash the rebellion of the [[Mulan]] in [[-2489 DR|−2489]] to [[-2488 DR|−2488 DR]], leaving the fortress virtually unmanned, confident no one would know how to access its ''[[portal]]s''.

==Legends==
It was said that [[Turami]] refugees displaced by the Mulan slaves dwelled in Metos for centuries before migrating westwards to [[Chessenta]], [[Unther]], and [[Turmish]].
