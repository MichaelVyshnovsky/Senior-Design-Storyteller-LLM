Metos was a fortress in the Methwood built by the Imaskari in . It was made famous by Hilather and Madryoch, who had their showdown in it.
Metos had, when created, sufficient extra-dimensional space to hold five-thousand soldiers and still be self-sufficient. It was very well protected against infiltration, as it required a portal key to access. The fortress was where Madryoch was confronted by a young Hilather, before being banished to the Demiplane of Imprisonment.
However, the strength of the complex was never tested. Lord Yuvaraj recalled the forces from the complex to quash the rebellion of the Mulan in −2489 to −2488 DR, leaving the fortress virtually unmanned, confident no one would know how to access its portals.
It was said that Turami refugees displaced by the Mulan slaves dwelled in Metos for centuries before migrating westwards to Chessenta, Unther, and Turmish.
