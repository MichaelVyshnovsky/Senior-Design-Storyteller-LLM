        "mainbody": "The '''Shrines of Nature''' was a temple complex in [[Waterdeep]] dedicated to the worship of the [[deities]] [[Mielikki]] and [[Silvanus]], as well as a garden. The shrine dedicated to Mielikki was commonly known as the '''Lady's Hands'''. While the shrine dedicated to Silvanus was known by many names, including '''Seatrees Shrine''', '''the Green Garden''', '''the Quiet Place''', and '''Oakenshade House'''.<ref>",
        "Location": "This temple complex was located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]], between [[Bliss Street]], [[Ivory Street]], and the [[Street of Whispers]].<ref>",
        "Structure": "This temple complex garden was walled-in, surrounded by an [[iron]] fence, and was very forested. It had a number of beautiful fountains, statues, and shrines within.\n\nTwo buildings stood inside the complex. For much of their existence, both buildings stood only a single story tall, but by [[1372 DR]] they had each gotten an additional floor.",
        "History": "These shrines to Mielikki and Silvanus were once separate, unaffiliated structures, but sometime around [[1367 DR]] they merged to become a temple complex and took up the name \"Shrines of Nature\".<ref><ref group=\"note\">The '''Shrines of Nature''' first appear in the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)]]'', which is set during [[1367 DR]]. Preceding sourcebooks ''[[City System]]'' ([[1357 DR]]), ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'', (also 1357 DR), ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'' ([[1358 DR]]), and ''[[Volo's Guide to Waterdeep]]'' ([[1363 DR|1363]] - [[1367 DR]]) all feature the shrines as separate and unrelated structures.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], the Shrines of Nature was one of the many temples within Waterdeep to receive an endowment from the nobleman [[Ultas Maernos]].\n\nBy the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the scope of the temple complex grew to honoring other nature deities in addition to Mielikki and Silvanus. By this time they also began to deny entry to those who weren't residents of the Sea Ward.",
        "Inhabitants": "Prior to becoming a temple complex, the high [[priest]]s [[Anarakin Iriboar]] and [[Briosar Helmsing]] ran their respective shrines to Silvanus and Mielikki. In addition, the shrine to Mielikki had a [[ranger]]-priest by the name of [[Tehtira Bellsilver]]."
