        "mainbody": "organizations =\n}}\nThe '''Chapel of Resounding Justice''' was a small fortified temple dedicated to [[Tyr]] located near [[Archenbridge]].",
        "Defenses": "The temple was protected by heavy reinforced doors. Rooftop vantages {{SI|20|feet}} from the ground allowed the inhabitants to defend against attackers, protected by chest-high parapets circling the outside walls.\n\nA well-stocked armory contained enough [[chainmail]] suits, [[shield]]s and [[weapon]]s to arm a dozen combatants. The chapel was usually manned by four soldiers and their captain, as well as a [[cleric]].",
        "History": {
            "Magical effects": "The statue in the middle of the courtyard radiated a gentle [[divine magic]], and at night glowed with a peaceful blue-white light. The temple reinforced the connection of the faithful with [[good domain]] spells, an effect especially strong for [[cleric]]s of the faith.\n\nThe divine magic protecting the place also helped stabilizing people on death's door, and creatures resting there would find their wounds healing faster than usual."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Those touching the statue could still feel the divine presence of [[Resounding Justice]].  Some believed she was still inside, waiting for the right time to serve her deity again. This was the subject of much debates within the clergy: some believed that they should find a way to restore her to life, while traditionalists argued this would undermine the meaning of her sacrifice, and potentially undo the magic that destroyed her foes."
