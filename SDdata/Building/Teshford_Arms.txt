The '''Teshford Arms''' was run by [[Olavia Tsardruyn]] and was the only real inn in [[Dagger Falls]].

==Activities==
When the weather was good enough for prospecting, traders from various places around the [[Moonsea]] and [[Dragon Reach]] took up residence here and bought [[gem]]s that miners brought out of the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]].{{Cite dragon/286/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shattershree's Rest}}

==Rumors==
The inn suffered from the fact that Olavia's mint wine was the only thing to recommend it. There were reports that it improved after the [[Zhent]] occupation in [[1369 DR]], but was rarely full.
