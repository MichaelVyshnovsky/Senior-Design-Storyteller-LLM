'''Mielikki's Glade''' was an open-air glade in the heart of [[Silverymoon]] and a shrine and college considered sacred to the goddess [[Mielikki]].

==Location==
[[File:Mielikki.png|thumb|left|''A map of Silverymoon with Mielikki's Glade highlighted in red.'']]
The glade was located in [[Southbank]] next to the [[Vault of the Sages]] and just west of the [[Helvraunur]] family's aviary.<ref>

==Description==
The open-air glade was formed by a ring of tall [[shadowtop]] trees, inside which were berry-bushes and [[fern]]s. The central area of the glade was covered in a carpet of lush [[moss]]. Visitors could often feel a divine and calming presence within the glade.

==Activities==
Services to Mielikki were held here day and night, and were led by Ladyservant [[Tathshandra Tyrar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

It also served as a college of [[church of Mielikki|the faith]].

==Features==
One of the trees was hollow and contained a ''[[portal]]'' to a house in [[Northbank]] where the clergy lived.

==History==
The goddess Mielikki and Lurue had been worshiped here since Silverymoon's earliest days.
