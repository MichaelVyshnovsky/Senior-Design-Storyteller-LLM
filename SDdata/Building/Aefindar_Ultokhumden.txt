'''Aefindar Ultokhumden''', also known as the '''Trademoot of Golden Fortune''', was a large [[cathedral]] dedicated to [[Vergadain]] in the city of [[Eartheart]]. It doubled as the city's central marketplace and the administrative center of Eartheart's ministry of trade and commerce.

==Location==
This cathedral was located in the center of Eartheart, on the rim of the [[Great Rift]].

==Structure==
This cathedral was like a fortress and had exterior walls that were made of [[granite]], but plated in [[gold]] that was so regularly polished that it shined intensely.

==Services==
The great hall of this temple acted as a marketplace, while its upper chambers was where Eartheart's ministry of trade and commerce were housed. The lower levels of Aefindar housed much of Eartheart's wealth, as well as three grand chapels dedicated to Vergadain.

==Inhabitants==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this cathedral was presided over by [[Ghaern Goldthumb]]. The number of [[priest]]s that resided within it at any given time was well over two hundred. Aefindar was also the homebase for hundreds of [[dwarf|dwarven]] merchants, with caravans spanning all across [[Faer√ªn]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The treasure vaults in the lower levels of Aefindar were rumored to not only be protected by a wide array of traps, but by three adult [[dragon]]s.
