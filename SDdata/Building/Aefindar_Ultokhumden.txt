Aefindar Ultokhumden, also known as the Trademoot of Golden Fortune, was a large cathedral dedicated to Vergadain in the city of Eartheart. It doubled as the citys central marketplace and the administrative center of Earthearts ministry of trade and commerce.
This cathedral was located in the center of Eartheart, on the rim of the Great Rift.
This cathedral was like a fortress and had exterior walls that were made of granite, but plated in gold that was so regularly polished that it shined intensely.
The great hall of this temple acted as a marketplace, while its upper chambers was where Earthearts ministry of trade and commerce were housed. The lower levels of Aefindar housed much of Earthearts wealth, as well as three grand chapels dedicated to Vergadain.
In the 14 century DR, this cathedral was presided over by Ghaern Goldthumb. The number of priests that resided within it at any given time was well over two hundred. Aefindar was also the homebase for hundreds of dwarven merchants, with caravans spanning all across Faer√ªn.
The treasure vaults in the lower levels of Aefindar were rumored to not only be protected by a wide array of traps, but by three adult dragons.
