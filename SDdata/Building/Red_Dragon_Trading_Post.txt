The Red Dragon Trading Post, also known as the Red Dragon Trading Lodge, was Luskans most successful overland trading company.
The post was located in the North Bank of Luskan near the Throat water tower in the Mirabar District.
Although not as aggressive as Luskans pirates, Red Dragon employees were always alert and well-armed. Due to staff shortages, they were usually looking to hire, at a rate of four gold pieces per day, with food, water and one potion of healing supplied per trip.
* 4 gp per day for caravan guarding (plus one healing potion)
