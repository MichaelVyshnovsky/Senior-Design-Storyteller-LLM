        "Description": "The main road leading up to the House of Many Tomes was surrounding by serene grasslands and well-manicured trees. The temple itself featured a number of columns, massive front doors and a massive stained-glass window that resembled Oghma's [[holy symbol]].Some descriptions based on the artist's rendering.\n\nJust outside the entrance, beyond the central walkway, was a single-tiered amphitheater."
