The Altar of Scales was a temple dedicated to Tiamat, the Dragon Queen within the Untheric pantheon.
The temple lay within the catacombs beneath the ruins of Unthalass in Unther.
The Altar of Scales survived the destruction of Unthalass when Tiamat and Gilgeam battled through the city, flourishing in the anarchy that ensured with the citys destruction. The leader of the temple at this time was High Priestess Shudu-Ab.
