Ikeshias Crypt was one of many crypts located in Polyandrium of Myth Drannor. The final resting place of Ikeshia, an elven noblewoman and philanthropist.
Ikeshias Crypt was nestled between the Crypt of Kesefehon to the north and Lyssics Crypt to south-west.
This crypt was one the smaller size but was masterfully built, encrusted in marble, its walls lined with intricate frescos.
Ikeshias Crypt was a small chamber. The room held several sarcofagi of Ikeshias family. One of which had a hidden panel in its floor that held withered manuscripts, old inkwells, sealing wax, and single golden seal with the elven noble family crest.
Before Myth Drannors destruction in the Weeping War, this crypt was sealed with elven word of power "haladrin" and the rune of cats. In 1369 DR, the Cult of the Dragon occupied the ruins of the City of Song and Ikeshias Crypt was one of the tombs unsealed and ransacked by them.
