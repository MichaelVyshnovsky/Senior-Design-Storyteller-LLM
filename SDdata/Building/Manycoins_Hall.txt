'''Manycoins Hall''' was the primary [[manycoins services]] establishment operated by the city of [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

==Location==
This edifice was located at the western end of [[Hael Way]], although it faced Dubrinlar (the gate through the west wall of Khôltar) across the wide intersection of the two triple-wide streets, Hael Way and [[Orntathtar Way]], as did its next door neighbor, the [[Malgart House]]. Across Hael Way, to the south, was the popular luthdren (restaurant) [[Vandanamer's]]. Diagonally to the southwest was the [[Maerador House of Welcome]]. Diagonally to the northwest was [[Darrusktraal]], the garthraun (police) station and duty-house for Dubrinlar.

==Structure==
Manycoins Hall was a large, almost cubic building that was styled to radiate dignity. Whether it succeeded or not was a matter of taste.

==Interior==
The lobby contained a map of the city that was large and detailed enough to show each building in the city. The buildings were not named but were labeled with codes that only had meaning to the tax collectors.

==Services==
The main purpose of Manycoins Hall was as a bank and currency exchange house, but they also drew up and witnessed trade agreements and contracts for a small fee. Scribes were available for hire to make copies of documents.
