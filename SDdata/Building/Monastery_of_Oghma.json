        "mainbody": "This building was a small [[monastery]] in the [[Gulthmere Forest]], dedicated to the worship of the [[deity]] [[Oghma]], in the 12{{th}} to 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].The ''[[Forging the Realms]]'' article \"Hulther's Mimics\" does not explicitly state where this monastery was located, only saying that it was \"in the deep forest southwest of what later became Starmantle.\" Because the only forest south of [[Starmantle]] is the [[Gulthmere Forest]], this article makes the assumption that it was the forest being referred to.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1146}}, an Oghmanyte [[priest]] by the name of [[Amanlas Hulther]] had discovered small [[mimic]]s within an ancient, dried-out well behind the monastery. He began to experiment on the creatures and prayed to his deity for guidance on what to do with them. Over the next two decades he came to control them through a strict regimen of punishment and food incentives, until eventually he bred them.\n\nAmanlas went on to show his work with the mimics to his superiors at the monastery. With their support, he spent another two decades breeding the mimics to have certain traits, culminating in what became known as a [[book mimic]], a creature bred for the purpose of guarding the tomes in Oghmanyte libraries. In the {{YearlinkName|1187}}, the now elderly Amanlas sent word of his achievement the highest-ranking Oghmanyte priests that he could.\n\nSometime in the late 1300s [[DR]], this monastery was destroyed and by the next century almost no traces of it remained."
