        "mainbody": "othaladreum was an ancient cemetery once used by the folk of Port Llast, located on the edge of the Neverwinter Wood, long abandoned and ruined by the late 14 century DR.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Gothaladreum was an old and weathered ruin with most of its gravestones and monuments overgrown, mausoleums crumbled, and the entire cemetery was wrapped in eery silence. Gothaladreum was connected to the Trade Way via a small path that led east.\nthumb|Gothaladreums layout gravestones, stone fence, ruined crypts, sprawling dead 351x351px\nGothaladreum became the final resting place for Lord Adreum VI of Port Llast sometime before the late 1000s DR. His grave stood just to the east of the cemeterys entrance, decorated with a statue of a winged angelic being. However, despite being interred, Lord Adreum VI did not find peace. His oath to protect Port Llast was unfulfilled, and for the centuries that followed, when the town was in danger, Adreum rose from his ancient grave as a restless ghost. In the years that followed the Shadow War of the , Port Llasts neighbor – the city of Luskan saw an opportunity in a weakened state of Neverwinter and its economy still recovering from the two recent wars. Luskan sent a force to claim the port city. This prompted the undead of Gothaladreum to rise and walk the streets of Port Llast every night.\nWhen a band of adventurers became involved with the invasion and the walking dead, they ventured into Gothaladreum and confronted the ancient restless Lord. History books did not record how the conflict was resolved. Some claimed that the adventurers sided with Luskan and destroyed the undead, while others said the heroes asked Lord Adreum VI to fulfill his oath to defend Port Llast from the Luskanite invaders. However, the walking dead of Gothaladreume risen by the necromancer named Nya, who were disturbing the burial sites to drive the Luskanites out. In order to get Lord Adreum VI and his undead servants help, the adventurers needed to kill the necromancer or convincer her to step down.\nCategoryGraveyards\nCategoryRuins\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryYear of Manuscripts\nCategoryHaunted locations\n08uzppw24lsepajicnwb5am5s69blwe"
