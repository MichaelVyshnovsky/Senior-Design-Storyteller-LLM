In early spring of {{yearlinkName|1373}}, [[Caladnei]] pointed out the Downed Falcon to her newest spy, the thief [[Narnra Shalace]] from [[Waterdeep]], as a regular watering hole for the [[War Wizard]]s [[Bowsar Ostramarr]] and [[Bathtar Flamegallow]], whom she was going to spy on for her first assignment.
