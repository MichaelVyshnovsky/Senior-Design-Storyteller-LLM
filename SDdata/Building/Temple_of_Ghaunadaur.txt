The '''Temple of Ghaunadaur''' was a temple in the [[Sword Coast North]] dedicated to the worship of [[Ghaunadaur]].

==Location==
The temple was located on the north-eastern side of the [[Sword Mountains]], near [[Wyvern Tor]].

==Description==
The Temple was described as foul, with walls and floors that seemed to take on qualities of ooze, and prayers to Ghaunadaur lining the walls.
{{Quote|''The walls seem to ooze and weep in this foul temple to That Which Lurks. Blasphemous prayers to Ghaunadaur line the walls, and the cavern floor seems to slosh and squish with every step. You almost feel your thoughts begin to cloud and slide as well, as you step deeper into this terrible temple.''}}

==History==
Sometime around [[1490 DR]], the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] traveled to the temple to recover the Sigil of Ghaunadaur for the [[drow]] [[Morlesh]], where, after fighting though the many [[ooze]]s of the dungeon as well as encountering a number of [[Church of Ghaunadaur|cultists of Ghaunadaur]], they confronted Morlesh in the temple's innermost chambers, as he explained his wish to rebuild the cult with himself as leader and intending to use mind control to offer his deity willing [[human]] sacrifices.
