Ammakyl Flowers and Foods was a shop in the village of Amphail, selling fruits, vegetables, and trail baskets. It was run by the Ammakyl family of Waterdeep.
During the summer and autumn months, an awning was erected outside the shop to provide extra space for the wares. It sold skewered vegetables that had been dipped in gravy, and during the winter it imported fruit and vegetables from the Shining South, selling them at high prices, especially out of season.
