The South Force Gate was the southwestern entry point into lower half of the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The South Force Gate sat on the southern side of the Force Bridge that spanned the River Tesh where it met the Moonsea.
The gate was flanked by a pair of guard towers.
The South Force Gate provided access to the Foreign Quarter from the Common Quarter and Harbor District via the Force Bridge.
