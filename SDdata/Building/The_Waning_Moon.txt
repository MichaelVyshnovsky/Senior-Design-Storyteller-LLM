The Waning Moon building had two stories and a basement and combined a distillery and a tavern.
The basement had the main bar counter and an improvised scene for actors. It was also used as warehouse for barrels and crates and had an exit to the embankment of the Chionthar river, where the goods produced in the distillery could be loaded on cargo ships using wooden loading cranes. The basement had a bunch of copper kettles and pumps connected through a pump system to the roof of the building.

The ground floor served as a drinking hall accommodating several tables and bar counters. The floor was filled with wine racks, kegs and tiered wine shelves. It also had a low bar counter with a sign "Halflings and gnomes order here" under a "Welcome" chalkboard.It is unknown if this counter was there throughout the whole history of the tavern. It could be implied that the counter was there only after the Sharrans took over Reithwin.
The first floor was used as a passage from the road leading to Baldurs Gate to one of the taverns entrances.
The Waning Moon also had outside tables with a notice board nearby.

In the late 14 century the distillery was owned by Thisobald Thorm, the son of general Ketheric Thorm, who turned into Sharran faith. Thisobald and his staff collected sensitive information and rumors reporting it to Ketherics Dark Justiciars.
The local bartender Madeline had to constantly report to Dark Justiciar Netasha about the gossips and chatter in the tavern leading to the death of her best friends Marc and Benjamin.According to Madelines Ledger.
As of the 10 Tarsakh, Thisobald continued to collect the exposing information against the Sel√ªnite resistance and Harpers. He focused his attention on the Reithwin Masons Guild head mason Mordfred who got drunk and called Thisobalds father a tyrant.According to The Waning Moon Consignments.
On the 6 Flamerule of an unknown year in the late 14 century a woman poisoned Thisobald and tried to blackmail him revealing his experiments to the Baldurs Gates authorities. She didnt expect that the distiller was resilient to poisoning, so she got captured by him and put in a wooden barrel inside his cave laboratory.According to The Waning Moon Consignments.
In  He Who Was was looking for an opportunity to obtain Madelines Ledger to hold the trial of Madelines soul.
