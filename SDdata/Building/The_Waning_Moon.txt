The Waning Moon building had two stories and a basement and combined a distillery and a tavern.

The basement had the main bar counter and an improvised scene for actors. It was also used as warehouse for [[barrel]]s and crates and had an exit to the embankment of the Chionthar river, where the goods produced in the distillery could be loaded on cargo ships using wooden loading cranes. The basement had a bunch of [[copper]] [[kettle]]s and pumps connected through a pump system to the roof of the building.

The ground floor served as a drinking hall accommodating several tables and bar counters. The floor was filled with wine racks, [[keg]]s and tiered wine shelves. It also had a low bar counter with a sign "''[[Halfling]]s and [[gnome]]s order here''" under a "''Welcome''" chalkboard.<ref group="note">It is unknown if this counter was there throughout the whole history of the tavern. It could be implied that the counter was there only after the Sharrans took over Reithwin.

The first floor was used as a passage from the road leading to Baldur's Gate to one of the tavern's entrances.

The Waning Moon also had outside tables with a notice board nearby.

===Cave Laboratory===

==Provender==
The establishment offered [[roasted chicken]], mashed beans, pottage stew, [[cabbage]] and beans, poultry, [[Durinbold cheese|Durinbold]] and [[Beregost Blue]] cheeses. It also served fresh [[tomato]]es, [[carrot]]s, [[onion]]s and [[garlic]].

==History==
[[File:Thisobald Thorm 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Thisobald Thorm, the owner of Waning Moon.'']]
In the late 14{{th}} century the distillery was owned by Thisobald Thorm, the son of general [[Ketheric Thorm]], who turned into [[Church of Shar|Sharran faith]]. Thisobald and his staff collected sensitive information and rumors reporting it to Ketheric's [[Dark Justiciars]].

The local bartender [[Madeline]] had to constantly report to Dark Justiciar [[Netasha]] about the gossips and chatter in the tavern leading to the death of her best friends [[Marc Jacobs|Marc]] and [[Benjamin Blanchet|Benjamin]].According to ''[[Madeline's Ledger]]''.

As of the [[Tarsakh 10|10{{th}} Tarsakh]], Thisobald continued to collect the exposing information against the Selûnite resistance and Harpers. He focused his attention on the [[Reithwin Mason's Guild]] head mason [[Mordfred]] who got drunk and called Thisobald's father a tyrant.<ref group="note">According to ''[[The Waning Moon: Consignments]]''.

On the [[Flamerule 6|6{{th}} Flamerule]] of an unknown year in the late 14{{th}} century a woman poisoned Thisobald and tried to blackmail him revealing his experiments to the Baldur's Gate's authorities. She didn't expect that the distiller was resilient to poisoning, so she got captured by him and put in a wooden [[barrel]] inside his cave laboratory.<ref group="note">According to ''[[The Waning Moon: Consignments]]''.

In {{YearlinkName|1492}} [[He Who Was]] was looking for an opportunity to obtain ''[[Madeline's Ledger]]'' to hold the trial of Madeline's soul.
