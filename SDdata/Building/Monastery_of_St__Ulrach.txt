The Monastery of St. Ulrach was a monastery dedicated to Ilmater, the Crying God, in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
It was located some two days ride south of the city of Loudwater, on the eastern edge of the Southwood forest.
The monastery resembled a fortress and stood on a rocky crag overlooking a winding creek. Around the crags base and along the creek was a thorp called St. Ulrach.
The monastery was built by a local Ilmatari saint known as St. Ulrach the Twice Martyred. He earned his appellation when he died, for the second time, in defense of the Delimbiyr Vale against marauding hobgoblins commanded by a cornugon circa 1363 DR.
With his sacrifice and sainthood, Ulrachs small monastic order swelled. They remained active almost a decade later, around 1372 DR.
The monks teachings were focused on finding strength in suffering and in the holy nature of working the earth and living a simple life. The monks grew plants and herbs. Evendur Olvebranch, a local sage, came to the monastery occasionally to collect some special herbs.
The monks visited Loudwater to tend to Tragedys Grotto, a shrine to Ilmater with a statue of St. Ulrach. They came regularly but not frequently.
