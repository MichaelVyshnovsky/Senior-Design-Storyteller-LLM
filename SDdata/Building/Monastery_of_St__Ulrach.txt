The '''Monastery of St. Ulrach''' was a monastery dedicated to [[Ilmater]], the Crying God, in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It was located some two days' ride south of the city of [[Loudwater]], on the eastern edge of the [[Southwood]] forest.

==Description==
The monastery resembled a fortress and stood on a rocky crag overlooking a winding creek. Around the crag's base and along the creek was a thorp called St. Ulrach.

==History==
The monastery was built by a local Ilmatari saint known as [[St. Ulrach|St. Ulrach the Twice Martyred]]. He earned his appellation when he died, for the second time, in defense of the Delimbiyr Vale against marauding [[hobgoblin]]s commanded by a [[cornugon]] ''circa'' [[1363 DR]].

With his sacrifice and sainthood, Ulrach's small monastic order swelled. They remained active almost a decade later, around [[1372 DR]].

==Activities==
The monks' teachings were focused on finding strength in suffering and in the holy nature of working the earth and living a simple life. The monks grew plants and [[herb]]s. [[Evendur Olvebranch]], a local sage, came to the monastery occasionally to collect some special herbs.

The monks visited Loudwater to tend to [[Tragedy's Grotto]], a shrine to Ilmater with a statue of St. Ulrach. They came regularly but not frequently.
