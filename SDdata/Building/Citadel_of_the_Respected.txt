The Citadel of the Respected was a fortress located in Muluk, the City of Kings, in 1367 DR.
The Citadel stood at the mouth of Al-Zalim River upon an artificial mount, providing easy access to any threats to Muluk approaching from the Great Sea. The Citadel was armed with three massive siege engines capable of hurling boulders at any attacking ships.
The Respected Mamluk Society within the city of Muluk operated out of the Citadel, giving the Citadel its name.
