        "mainbody": "'''Thornhold''', also known as '''Stoneshaft Hold''' among its [[dwarven]] residents,",
        "Location": "The keep was situated a short way from the top of a hill whose west side dropped off into a seaside cliff. The hill itself was located to the west of the [[High Road]] and just beyond the southern border of the Mere of Dead Men.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|11}}",
        "Structure": "Thornhold was a plain gray stone fort that comprised a central keep and two towers. Its walls featured no decorations, only evenly-spaced arrow slits set upon its façade with battlements set atop.",
        "Interior": "Within the outer walls were a number of wood-and-plaster buildings, along with enough space to accommodate camping sites for numerous travelers.",
        "Services": "As of the early 1490s DR, the fortress was used as a way stop that aided merchants and [[adventurer]]s traveling through one of the more dangerous stretches of the [[Sword Coast North]].\n\nSkilled crafts-and-tradespeople offered their services to those that chose to take refuge at Thornhold. Among the talented individuals were skilled [[gem]]-cutters, [[:Category:Wainwrights|wainwrights]], [[:Category:blacksmiths|smithies]], and even [[:category:brewers|brewers]].",
        "History": "The earliest records said that Thornhold was the fortress of [[Brunyundar Margaster]], a local warlord of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] [[Margaster]] family. it actually functioned as a chapterhouse for the [[Tyrran]] [[Knights of Samular]]\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1368}}, [[Hronrulf Caradoon]] died and the family keep was briefly seized by the [[Zhentarim]]. The malevolent agents traveled through the [[Underdark]], enslaved many [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Stoneshaft]], and made their way in through the underground passage beneath Thornhold.\n\nThe clan's leader [[Ebenezer Stoneshaft]] rallied his kin and allied himself with Hronrulf's daughter and agent of the [[Harpers]], [[Bronwyn Caradoon]]. The allies banded together and reclaimed the ancestral Margaster home from the Zhentarim. The dwarves renamed the keep '''Stoneshaft Hold''' and transformed it into a caravan stop for traders about to brave the stretch of the High Road bordering the Mere of Dead Men.\n\nWhen the [[Spellplague]] brought on geological changes to all of [[Faerûn]] ''circa'' the 1380s [[DR]], the Mere of Dead Men expanded and trade to and from the keep was largely cut off. During that time the Stoneshaft dwarves became increasingly isolated from the surrounding lands.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were rumors that said that the caves beneath Thornhold held a passageway that led down to the depths of the [[Underdark]]. While true, the existence of these caves were largely kept secret by the dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century, both the Margaster family and the Knights of Samular both felt they were owed the rights to claim Thornhold for their respective interests."
