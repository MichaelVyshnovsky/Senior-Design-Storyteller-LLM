        "mainbody": "The Beacon was a pleasant inn in Thentia. It was named for the globe lit by a continual flame mounted on its roof.\nThe Inlet was on a main intersection in south-eastern Thentia, not far from the docks.\nThe Beacons bedrooms were soundproofed to ensure a good nights sleep.\nThe Beacon particularly attracted boisterous travelers and adventurers who desired a comfortable and friendly place to relax at. It offered food, drink, and bedrooms, and all three for the night were provided for 8 gp. The innkeep Moavar enjoyed telling tales of his time on the sea, both true and false."
