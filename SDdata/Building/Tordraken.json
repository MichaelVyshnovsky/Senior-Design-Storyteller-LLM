With the events that took place in the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], Tordraken was ruined and Draknor was no more. Duke Blackthorn renovated the keep and used it as his second home, away from Velen.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Tordraken had regained its status as the ducal castle and the seat of power in Cape Velen. The keep hosted a grand masquerade gala annually a [[tenday]] after [[Harvestcourt]]."
