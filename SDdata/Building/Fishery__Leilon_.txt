The '''Fishery''' was a store of the fishing industry in [[Leilon]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was also temporarily used as the town hall in ''circa'' [[1491 DR]]. Town councilor [[Valdi Estapaar]] was in charge of the Fishery.

==Location==
The Fishery was located at [[Quayside]] north of the [[barge yard]].

==Services==
The Fishery was where local fisherfolk sold their catches and most business relating to selling or repairing fishing equipment took place. During the reconstruction efforts, the Fishery also served as a makeshift town hall in the evenings. Outside the Fishery, there was a job board with adverts for [[adventurers]] searching for employment.
