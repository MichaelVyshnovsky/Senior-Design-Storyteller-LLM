century DR
The Mermaids Purse was the best inn in Corth, Aglarond, around 1368 DR, operated by the ex-fisherman Droze.
It was constructed in the typical Aglarondan architectural style, made from weathered wood with a steep roof and dormers. It was built with three stories. The rooms offered were small but comfortable.
The inn served local fish and sometimes beef or vegetables.
