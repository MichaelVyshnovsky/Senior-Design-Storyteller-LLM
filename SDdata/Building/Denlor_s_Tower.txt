Denlors Tower or Denelors Tower was a former city defense structure in the city of Phlan. It was located in the harbor in the eastern part of the Old City. It was claimed by Denelor the Red, a Red Wizard of Thay in 1338 DR but history recounted that he "fell to the hordes of Phlan" only 2 years after. It was later in use by Rowena circa 1370 DR, who was also a Red Wizard.
