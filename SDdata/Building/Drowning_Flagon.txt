The '''Drowning Flagon''' was an inn in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]] owned by [[Polinar Kirin]] and was originally established by a noble. 

==Structure==
It was situated on its own island and comsisted of several buildings including kitchens, stables, and a central hall featuring luxurious dancing chambers. 

===Interior===
This hall had three floors, the bottom two of which were used for dancing and the top floor for sleeping. It had two entrances: one for locals and one for visitors. It was used as a meeting place for gambling or for local organizations, but become expensive to stay in, attracting wealthier visitors to the city. Ever since a devastating fire, the kitchens were in their own separate building.

Rooms for 7 gp per night for each person
