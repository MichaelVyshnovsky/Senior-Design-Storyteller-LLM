Its northernmost neighbor was Fallenstar Fine Gems shop across the street, and Redcloak Trading on Sarbronts Walk, several doors east.\nThe shop dealt in expensive jewelry and maps. Jewelry on offer was unimpressive by the Gem Districts bloated standards, but the shops main stock was maps dealt from its back room. The owner did not allow browsing, knowing that a maps true price depended on the number of eyes and copies. The establishment also purchased maps, yet due to the proprietors impressive memory, it was almost impossible to sell him fakes. On occasion, Blevynsoar House commissioned adventures to go on mapping expeditions on the proprietors behalf.\nThe shops proprietor, Jared Blevyn, the \"Mapmaster of Amn,\" was known as a loyal employee of the gem-trading Zhanye family of Athkatla. While under its employ, Jared traveled countless roads and, thanks to his uncanny memory, mapped every single detail along his travels. One day, sometime before the , Jared used his mapmaking to discover a treasure of Parleks Folly. He used the loot to open the Blevynsoar House."
