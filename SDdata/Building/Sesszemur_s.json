        "mainbody": "'''Sesszemur's''' was a restaurant (known locally as a luthdren) located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|68-69}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Khôltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}",
        "Location": "This luthdren was located on the southwest side of [[Hael Way]] just west of [[Harth Trithketh's House of Welcome]] and the southern gate of Khôltar (known as Farrgaunlar). Further to the west, across an alley, was [[Halamor's Sure Service]] and [[Thalarmol's]]. Across Hael Way was the seat of the [[Horthander]] clan, a klathlaaedin (carved stone mansion) they called [[Anthormbrur]].",
        "Description": "The first two floors of Sesszemur's were large dining halls with open floor plans arranged so dozens of customers shared huge tables in a relaxed atmosphere. The third floor had a lower ceiling, smaller tables spaced farther apart, and curtained booths for even more privacy. Gambling tables and gaming rooms were also on the third floor. [[Sesszemur]] had a private elevator that took him between the  third floor and the kitchens.",
        "Services": "This luthdren served a wide variety of dishes that Sesszemur tasted and adjusted to his liking. He was known for serving [[Fruit jelly|fruit jellies]] made with exotic imported ingredients, and for creating impressively huge sculptured roasts. Crowd favorites were edible [[dragon]] heads that were sculpted out of various meats and vegetables, sometimes with additional props for effect. These life-sized sculptures were borne around the room on [[wagon]]-sized [[silver]] [[platter]]s by many strong servers until they were set down on the tables and carved up for the guests. Occasionally, Sesszemur would have his best-looking servers dress in thematic costumes and ride along with the food until it reached its destination, then hop off and begin distributing the meal.",
        "Inhabitants": "Sesszemur, a [[halfling]], considered himself a gourmand and supervised the kitchens whenever he wasn't gambling."
