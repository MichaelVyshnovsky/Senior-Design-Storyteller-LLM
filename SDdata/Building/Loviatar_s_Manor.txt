'''Loviatar's Manor''', known to its congregation as '''The Manor''', was a temple dedicated to [[Loviatar]] in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]]. It was believed to be the largest Loviatan temple in all of [[Faer√ªn]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple was located in eastern-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." It was adjacent to several other temples, including the [[Temple of Sharess (Bezantur)|Temple of Sharess]] to the north, the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] and [[House of Iyachtu Xvim]] to the east, and the [[Temple of Oghma (Bezantur)|Temple of Oghma]] to the south.

==Structure==
The temple was one of the largest in Bezantur. It was built into a hillside and was surrounded by extensive and fastidiously maintained gardens lined with graveled paths and dotted with fountains.

==Interior==
The Manor's many rooms were haphazardly laid out. These included common rooms for group "worship" activities dedicated to the [[goddess]] of pain, as well as private rooms for more intimate "worship". It had an indoor swimming pool.

==Activities==
The Manor was popular not only with Loviatar's faithful, but with those who paid her little heed but nevertheless lusted for the many services available within the Manor's walls. This second group included [[Red Wizards]] and even [[cleric]]s of other faiths.

==History==
Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], Thayans only worshiped Loviatar as a handmaiden of [[Bane]] or [[Bhaal]], and was thus venerated within their temples. The Manor was the only temple in all of Thay that was dedicated solely to her worship.

As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the Manor was one of the more notable temples in Bezantur. as well as with the city's premier [[Tattooist (Bezantur)|tattoist]]. As of this time, the Manor was at risk of losing some of its pleasure-seeking congregation to the [[Temple of Sharess (Bezantur)|Temple of Sharess]], which offered far less painful delights.

==Inhabitants==
In the late 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was [[Mylra]], who was active in all forms of worship practiced in the Manor.
