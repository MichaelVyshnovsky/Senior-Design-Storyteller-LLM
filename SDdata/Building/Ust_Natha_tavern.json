        "mainbody": "The Usta Natha tavern was a two-floored inn, which had a variety of services of drow custom.\nThe tavern had two floors. The first floor featured two arenas which patrons could participate in. The winners got to keep the spoils of the duel, and may have been awarded with gold. The same floor had a bar, with several tables and chairs, where many customers would share stories of their lives and Ust Nathas history.\nTwo arenas were present in the tavern. One was for fighting captured creatures (such as umber hulks), owned by Szordrin, the other for duels between drow, owned by Sondal. The second arena would feature battles between the same classes either fighters or mages. The bar served drow beverages, Orbbzhin, Kulg and Streea. They also sold surface beverages, such as bitter black ale and mead, but were incredibly expensive, most over ten times the cost of the normal drinks.\nThe top floor held many lust chambers, for acts such as oil massages, and those more intimate. A large cage kept a few drow prisoners, such as those from House DeVir, whom had recently fallen out of favor of Lolth. A drow female sentenced the little-known male, Malafein DeVir to death here. The other area of interest was a contraption that would transport a slave to a passageway overlooking a red fluid. The slave was forced to walk onto a magical rune, which would explode, exploding the slave into pieces. It cost 100 gold pieces to indulge in such entertainment.\nSome drow would spend a large amount of time in the tavern, either for work or leisure\n* Baragh\n* Chalinthra\n* Ilmryn Despana\n* Lasaonar\n* Merinid\n* Nym Khalazza\n* Sondal\n* Szordrin\n* Tathlyn"
