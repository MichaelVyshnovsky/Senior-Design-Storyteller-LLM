        "mainbody": "'''Fish Tails''' was a seafood factory located in [[the Shutters]] neighborhood of the [[Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Fish Tails was an old warehouse turned into a factory, just two doors down from the [[Ravensbridge]] on [[Karen Court]].",
        "Services": "The factory produced fried [[fishcake]]s made with various types of [[fish]], with an occasional [[turtle]], [[crab]], and [[squid]] ending up in the mix. The factory workers minced, sauced, mixed, breaded, and fried the fish slop parts into hand-sized cakes that were considered to be good quality among other such fishcakes produced elsewhere. The factory workers insisted that no [[rat]]s, [[cat]]s or other non-marine life ever ended up in the foods produced in Fish Tails, despite what local tales claimed.",
        "Inhabitants": "The factory was staffed with retired sailors who were unable to work aboard ships after being maimed, riddled with chronic pains, or simply aged."
