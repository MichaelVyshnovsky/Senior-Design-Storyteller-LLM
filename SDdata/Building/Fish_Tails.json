        "mainbody": "Fish Tails was a seafood factory located in the Shutters neighborhood of the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff in the late 14 century DR.\nFish Tails was an old warehouse turned into a factory, just two doors down from the Ravensbridge on Karen Court.\nThe factory produced fried fishcakes made with various types of fish, with an occasional turtle, crab, and squid ending up in the mix. The factory workers minced, sauced, mixed, breaded, and fried the fish slop parts into hand-sized cakes that were considered to be good quality among other such fishcakes produced elsewhere. The factory workers insisted that no rats, cats or other non-marine life ever ended up in the foods produced in Fish Tails, despite what local tales claimed.\nThe factory was staffed with retired sailors who were unable to work aboard ships after being maimed, riddled with chronic pains, or simply aged."
