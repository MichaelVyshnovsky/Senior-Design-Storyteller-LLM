        "mainbody": "The '''Cloister of St. Uzurr''' was a monastery of [[Ilmater]] that lay at the heart of city of [[Uzurr]] in [[Lapaliiya]] and was home to the [[Order of St. Uzurr]].",
        "History": "It was founded during the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]] ([[27 DR|27]]–[[450 DR]]), when Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr traveled from [[Calimshan]] to Lapaliiya. On a hilltop west of the Lapal Way, they constructed a walled monastery with a cloister, named the Cloister of St. Uzurr after their patron [[Saint Uzurr|saint]]. In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, which became known simply as \"Uzurr\".\n\nA member of the Order was a spy working for the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Eselemas]] and reported on Kadar's research into curing [[tainted one]]s and [[broodguard]]s. In response, [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s began infiltrating Uzurr on [[Eleasis 1|Eleasias 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], with the aim of assassinating Kadar.<ref name=tGHotR-p153>",
        "Organization": "Both the monastery and the city were governed by the Abbot of St. Uzurr. ''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], this was Abbot [[Kadar al Ilmater]].",
        "Activities": "The Order, Cloister, and city cultivated, produced and exported olives, [[wine]]s, and assorted [[spices]] to support themselves.",
