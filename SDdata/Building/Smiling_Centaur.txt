The '''Smiling Centaur''' was a drinking establishment once frequented by former [[adventuress]] [[Zaranda Star]].
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Location==
The tavern was located in the city of [[Zazesspur]] in [[Tethyr]], within the section of the [[Zazesspur/Low City|Low City]] known as the [[Fortress (district)|Fortress]], south of the [[Sulduskoon River|river]].

==Interior==
The Smiling Centaur was a typical tavern such as found on the [[Sword Coast]] or the [[Vilhon Reach]], except that it was built with larger-sized creatures in mind. It had a single large common room with a low ceiling with smoky rafters, which was lit by [[candle]]s set in [[wagon]] wheels hung from [[chain]]s. On the walls hung [[oil lamp]]s in caged [[iron]] sconces. The tables and chairs were built out of tough materials but were otherwise relatively cheap quality and marked with many [[knives]]. A single large hearth&mdash;large enough to cook an [[ox]]&mdash;filled one wall.

==Services==
The tavern sold several less-popular [[wine]]s.

==Staff==
The Smiling Centaur was owned and named after an oft-cheerful [[centaur]] named [[Berdak]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, then-adventuress Zaranda Star visited the tavern with her traveling companions [[Vander Stillhawk]], Father [[Pelletyr]], [[Shield of Innocence]], and [[Farlorn Half-Elven]]. While there, she drank wine with a former companion warrior named [[Valides]]. Zaranda and Valides argued local politics, until the latter grew interested in the strange cowled figure in the shadows, who was Shield of Innocence, an unwelcomed-in-most-settings [[orog]]. Tensions in the tavern began to rise, but before Shield's hood was uncovered, Father Pelletyr suddenly screamed in pain and collapsed to the floor. He had died of [[heartstop]].
