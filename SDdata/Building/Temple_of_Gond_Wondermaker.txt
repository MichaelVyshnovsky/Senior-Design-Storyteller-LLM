The '''Temple of Gond Wondermaker''', also known as the '''House of the Wonderbringer''', and called '''Gharri's House''' during [[Gharri]]'s time, was a temple dedicated to [[Gond]] in the city of [[Tilverton]], and the largest temple in the city.

==Location==
The temple was located in the southwest section of the city atop the Old Town rise, near the ruins of [[Tilver's Palace]].

==Description==
The main entrance of Gond's temple resembled a massive anvil. Its architecture featured stark, powerful shapes that stood in contrast to the surrounding shops.

==History==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the high priest of the temple, [[Gharri]], served as the respected Elder of the city, making him the closest thing to a ruling figure. The temple itself was one of the grandest structures in the town. When [[Cormyr]] annexed the city in [[1356 DR]], Gharri briefly served as Lord Regent before leaving in disgust. He was replaced as high priest by [[Burlan Almaether]].

Many of Gond's faithful temporarily lost their faith during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}.

As of [[1367 DR]], the temple had recently invented an ingenious float valve that aided in the regulation of water flow.

The temple was presumed destroyed along with the rest of Tilverton in [[1372 DR]], creating the [[Tilverton Scar]].

==Inhabitants==

The temple was run by High Priest [[Burlan Almaether]], who was filling in for his missing predecessor [[Gharri]]. Burlan was assisted by 26 other priests and 39 followers,
