The Temple of Gond Wondermaker, also known as the House of the Wonderbringer, and called Gharris House during Gharris time, was a temple dedicated to Gond in the city of Tilverton, and the largest temple in the city.
The temple was located in the southwest section of the city atop the Old Town rise, near the ruins of Tilvers Palace.
The main entrance of Gonds temple resembled a massive anvil. Its architecture featured stark, powerful shapes that stood in contrast to the surrounding shops.
In the mid-14 century DR, the high priest of the temple, Gharri, served as the respected Elder of the city, making him the closest thing to a ruling figure. The temple itself was one of the grandest structures in the town. When Cormyr annexed the city in 1356 DR, Gharri briefly served as Lord Regent before leaving in disgust. He was replaced as high priest by Burlan Almaether.
Many of Gonds faithful temporarily lost their faith during the Time of Troubles in the .
As of 1367 DR, the temple had recently invented an ingenious float valve that aided in the regulation of water flow.
The temple was presumed destroyed along with the rest of Tilverton in 1372 DR, creating the Tilverton Scar.
