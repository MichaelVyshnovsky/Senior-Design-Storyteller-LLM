Sculptures for the Elite was a shop located in the Grand Bazaar of Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This shop was located on the south side of the bazaar. Splendid sculptures of obsidian and marble could be purchased here. Life-sized sculptures could be ordered and ready in as little as two days, assuming the customer would pose during part of that time.
Jera al-Farif owned and operated this establishment.
