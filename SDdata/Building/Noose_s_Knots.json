He had turned his extensive seafaring knowledge of ropes, nets, and knotwork into a thriving business. Known for providing ropes of superior quality, Noose and his small team of skilled hands were regularly found braiding fibers such as hemp into durable rope, charging above-average prices that reflected their craftsmanship."
