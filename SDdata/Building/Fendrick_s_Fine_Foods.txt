The building that housed Fendricks Fine Foods was a small one-story yellow-tan painted building.
Fendricks Fine Foods was renown for being the best, if not the only eatery in town. The establishment catered to clientele tired of hardtack adventurers rations and served well-crafted meals, with the dish known as the "chicken surprise" being the chefs specialty. Some foodies traveled from across the Dalelands to try said dish. A standard dining experience cost just a few silver coins.
In the mid-14 century DR, the owner of the restaurant and its cook was Fendrick himself. He took his trade seriously and cared for cooking more than anything else in his life. His staff consisted of a junior cook named Boris, and a serving lass Clara.
