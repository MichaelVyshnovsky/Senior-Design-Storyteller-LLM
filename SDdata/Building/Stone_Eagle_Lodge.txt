Stone Eagle Lodge was an outpost and guardhouse of the Hellriders of Elturel. It stood beside the River Chionthar where it ran west of Elturel, in the Fields of the Dead. Stone Eagle Lodge marked the western limit of Elturels reach circa 1366 DR.
Like all their Lodges, its purpose was to supply Hellrider patrols, with fresh mounts kept ready and stocks of food, water, weapons, and flammables on hand. Situated at strategic sites, these Lodges were protected by stockades and strong magical wards against arson and theft, which could be bypassed by certain ward tokens.
