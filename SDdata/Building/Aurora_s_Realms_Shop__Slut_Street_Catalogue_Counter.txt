Auroras Realms Shop, Slut Street Catalogue Counter was an outlet of the Auroras Emporium retail chain in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep in the midâ€“14 century DR. It was one of six such outlets in the city.
It was located on Zastrow Street (formerly Slut Street), next door to the Purple Palace festhall (with a narrow side alley separating them) and two doors up from the Old Xoblob Shop.
It was located in a three-story-high tenement building of unremarkable appearance. 
This shop sold the various items found in Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. Opening hours were dawn to dusk. 
The nearby Old Xoblob Shop was not a competitor for the catalogue counter, as the curio shop sold everything Auroras did not, could not, or would not.
In the mid-1360s DR, Aglatha Shrey worked here as a counter clerk and Beradyx Halfwinter  was a transportation mage who delivered goods to the store by teleporting them. In addition, there were two brawny guards who worked during opening hours.
