Rendarils Emporium was the largest and busiest mercantile building in Bryn Shander during the late 15 century DR. It owed its name to its proprietor, the cunning half-elven merchant Rendaril.
It was located in the center of town, with its facade oriented towards the marketplace.
The Emporium bought all manner of goods from the folks of the Ten Towns and offered the widest variety of items for sale.
Among the items they offered were yew fishing rods, scrimshaw accessories, yeti-fur clothing and mithral tools and weapons made by the local dwarves.
Rendarils Emporium was converted from an old cabin that predated the town of Bryn Shander. That cabin was actually the structure around which the settlement formed.
