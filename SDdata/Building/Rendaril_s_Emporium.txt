'''Rendaril's Emporium''' was the largest and busiest mercantile building in [[Bryn Shander]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. It owed its name to its proprietor, the cunning [[half-elven]] merchant [[Rendaril]].

==Geography==
It was located in the center of town, with its facade oriented towards the marketplace.

==Services==
The ''Emporium'' bought all manner of goods from the folks of the [[Ten Towns]] and offered the widest variety of items for sale.

Among the items they offered were: [[yew]] [[fishing rod]]s, [[scrimshaw]] accessories, [[yeti]]-[[fur]] clothing and [[mithral]] [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s made by the local [[dwarves]].

==History==
Rendaril's Emporium was converted from an old cabin that predated the town of Bryn Shander. That cabin was actually the structure around which the settlement formed.
