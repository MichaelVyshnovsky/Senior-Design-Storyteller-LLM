He'd related information of this citadel to [[Sammaster]] some years prior.{{cite book/The Ruin|55-57|2}} Sammaster, in turn, visited this citadel at some point prior to [[Uktar 9]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, a time at which he'd already modified the ''dracorage mythal''.{{cite book/The Rage|209|14}}\n\nOn [[Eleasis 20]], Sammaster made a deal with Iyraclea, so that she'd slay any intruders on the Great Glacier.{{cite book/The Ruin|99|5}} On [[Marpenoth 17]], after capturing the intruders sought by Sammaster, rather than slay them, she made prisoners of them but agreed to let them continue their search, interested in what the lich was concealing.{{cite book/The Ruin|103-104|5}} On [[Marpenoth 26]], Iyraclea's forces found the fortress. She, her prisoners, and a retinue explored the place through the evening.{{cite book/The Ruin|136|6}} Instants prior to the destruction, [[Karasendrieth]] managed to activate the portal and escape with some of the other prisoners.{{cite book/The Ruin|132|6}}"
