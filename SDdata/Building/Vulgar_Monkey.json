        "mainbody": "The Vulgar Monkey was a single-floored tavern located in the center of Brynnlaw.\nThe tavern had a small entryway to the main area, which also served as a kitchen. It had a single stove, and a few tables displaying bread and other goods. The main area contained a bar with surrounding stools, as well as many tables and chairs.\nSailors, pirates, and courtesans mainly occupied the Vulgar Monkey. The sailors, often very drunk, could be found singing hearty songs about their voyages across the seas.\nRooms suitable for peasants and merchants could be rented out for the night. Baked goods and several different types of beers, mead, and wine were sold here.\nIn 1369 DR, the trader, Sanik, was assassinated in the tavern."
