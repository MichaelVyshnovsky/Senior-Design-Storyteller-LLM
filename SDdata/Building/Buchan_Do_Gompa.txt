Buchan Do Gompa was a monastery (a gompa in the Tabotan language) of the Way of Enlightenment in Tabot.
It stood on the southwestern border of Tabot, near the border with Phutan.
The monks of Buchan Do were often in conflict with the people of Phutan.
It was founded some time between  and , when fifteen groups of monks and temple guardians escaped persecution in Shou Lung and journeyed southwest in search of a holy land that would remain pure and lasting, ideal for isolated hermitages. One of these groups built the beginnings of Buchan Do.
In , Buchan Do lamas reported a Phutanese army assembling at the border. This put Tabot on a war footing, with its own soldiers mustering in the area.
