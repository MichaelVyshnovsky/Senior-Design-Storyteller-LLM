Boars Rest was a stone mansion located in the town of Triboar. It was built by, and served as the residence for, the pompous retired adventurer Hyuth Kolstaag.
It was built on a small hill, on the northwest side of the Long Road, that offered a great view overlooking the town.
The interior of Boars Rest was decorated with a number of souvenirs and relics from Kolstaags adventuring years.
The Boars Rest was constructed about five years before Triboar was assaulted by a pair of fire giants and their minions.
