        "mainbody": "he Gate of Good Fortune was a temple to Tymora in the city of Mulmaster in the Moonsea in the mid-to-late 14 and late 15 centuries DR.\nIt stood in the northeast of the city, near the Black Lords Altar, a temple to first Bane and then Cyric, and opposite the Tower of the Blades. Usilie Rostiks Smoke Shoppe lay halfway between the Gate of Good Fortune and the House Built on Gold, the temple to Waukeen.\nIt was the smallest of Mulmasters temples but large enough. It was violet in color. A plaza lay in front of it.\nInside, there were two grand chambers. One was the worship chamber constantly illuminated with a relaxing purple light, it was a place of peaceful contemplation. The other was the casino, in which a myriad of games of chance and gambling were played for \"the holy rites of Tymora\". The temple was kept clean and fragrant with incense.\nThe temple also had a relatively safe and clear entrance to the sewers.\nThe temples sizeable treasury was guarded by four huge clay golems.\nIn the late 1350s and 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was the Hand of the Lady Naneetha Danchul, who led nine priests and a guard there was Chesslyn Onaubra. By 1373 DR, the high priest was Niskal Rinay.\nThe temple also operated as a casino. The house winnings were used for maintaining the temple.\nIf the Tymoran priests learned of a new adventuring company in Mulmaster, they might reach out to them to offer discounts on healing potions and scrolls.\nEvery two tendays or so, Dzurdan Crommarch rode south to the village of Maskyrs Eye, accompanied by two followers and four men-at-arms, to collect offerings left at the shrine of Tymora there from the local priest Khonduil Ammargath. If he learned that anyone had desecrated the shrine, stolen the offerings, or hurt the old priest, then Dzurdan would search for those responsible.\nIn the , an earthquake struck Mulmaster. Though neighboring buildings collapsed, the Gate of Good Fortune showed its own good fortune by remaining undamaged, so in the aftermath it became a shelter and gathering place for fearful local Mulmasterites. The Helmite paladin Zern Xerkstil and some adventurers consulted the Tymorans for divinations as to the cause. That was soon revealed as four giant badgers and a monk of the Cult of the Black Earth infiltrated from below and attacked priests and civilians alike. The adventurers dealt with this and pursued the cultists into the sewers."
