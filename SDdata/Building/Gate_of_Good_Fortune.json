        "mainbody": "The '''Gate of Good Fortune''' was a temple to [[Tymora]] in the city of [[Mulmaster]] in the [[Moonsea]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/67/The Everwinking Eye: Who's Who in Mulmaster, Part 2|22}}{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|39-42}}",
        "Location": "It stood in the northeast of the city, near the [[Black Lord's Altar]], a temple to first [[Bane]] and then [[Cyric]], and opposite the [[Tower of the Blades]]. [[Usilie Rostik's Smoke Shoppe]] lay halfway between the Gate of Good Fortune and the [[House Built on Gold]], the temple to [[Waukeen]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|18}}",
        "Structure": "It was the smallest of Mulmaster's temples but large enough. It was violet in color. A plaza lay in front of it.",
        "Interior": "Inside, there were two grand chambers. One was the worship chamber; constantly illuminated with a relaxing purple light, it was a place of peaceful contemplation. The other was the casino, in which a myriad of games of chance and gambling were played for \"the holy rites of Tymora\". The temple was kept clean and fragrant with incense.\n\nThe temple also had a relatively safe and clear entrance to the [[Mulmaster/Sewers|sewers]].",
        "Defenses": "The temple's sizeable treasury was guarded by four huge [[clay golem]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the late 1350s and 1360s DR, the high priestess of the temple was the Hand of the Lady [[Naneetha Danchul]], who led nine priests{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Everwinking Eye: Adventures in Maskyr's Eye|27}} and a guard there was [[Chesslyn Onaubra]]. By [[1373 DR]], the high priest was [[Niskal Rinay]].",
        "Activities": "The temple also operated as a casino.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|18}} The house winnings were used for maintaining the temple.\n\nIf the Tymoran priests learned of a new [[adventuring company]] in Mulmaster, they might reach out to them to offer discounts on healing [[potion]]s and [[scroll]]s.\n\nEvery two [[tenday]]s or so, Dzurdan Crommarch rode south to the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]], accompanied by two followers and four men-at-arms, to collect offerings left at the shrine of Tymora there from the local priest [[Khonduil Ammargath]]. If he learned that anyone had desecrated the shrine, stolen the offerings, or hurt the old priest, then Dzurdan would search for those responsible.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, an earthquake struck Mulmaster. Though neighboring buildings collapsed, the Gate of Good Fortune showed its own good fortune by remaining undamaged, so in the aftermath it became a shelter and gathering place for fearful local Mulmasterites. The [[Helmite]] [[paladin]] [[Zern Xerkstil]] and some [[adventurer]]s consulted the Tymorans for [[divination]]s as to the cause. That was soon revealed as four [[giant badger]]s and a monk of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] infiltrated from below and attacked priests and civilians alike. The adventurers dealt with this and pursued the cultists into the sewers."
