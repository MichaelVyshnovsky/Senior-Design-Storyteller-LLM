The Arabellan Palace was the home of the ruler of Arabel in Cormyr.
The palace was luxurious to behold. It had five narrow towers, with elegantly sweeping turrets and conical roofs. The palace contained the court of Myrmeen Lhal and an assembly hall.
The palace was located in the most prosperous section of the city, the north, being surrounded by the citadel and multiple mansions of the rich elite and by the Ladys House, a temple to Tymora.
Soldiers of the Purple Dragons were stationed as palace guards. These were members of the citys garrison, which was under the command of Myrmeen Lhal.
Several floors of the palace were also warded by ring wards.
Guests of the king were usually housed nearby in the Dragons Rest instead of in the palace.
