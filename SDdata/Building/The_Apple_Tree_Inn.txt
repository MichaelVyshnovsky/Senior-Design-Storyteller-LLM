'''The Apple Tree Inn''' was a ''[[ryokan]]'' (inn) in [[Aru]] in [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]]. Small and unremarkable, it stood in the Pilgrim District, near the gate to the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]], and was likely named for the temple's sacred [[apple]] tree.

The thief [[Komatsu]] stayed at The Apple Tree Inn in {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, and might've been confronted by adventurers there.
