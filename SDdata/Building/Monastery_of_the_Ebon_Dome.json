        "mainbody": "Order of the Dark Moon\nThe Monastery of the Ebon Dome was a Sharran temple built by the Order of the Dark Moon long before the Era of Upheaval. It was later repurposed in the late 14 century DR by a contingent of Cyricist militants called the Company of the Ebon Spur, a group that aligned themselves with the black dragon Despayr.\nThe monastery was situated atop a hill on the eastern end of the Whispermere in the Shadow Swamp on the Plane of Shadow. A small, barely-illuminated dock was built on the bank of the river, approximately  away .\nIt was accessible from Toril by means of the Dusk Lords Passage, a portal found inside the Lost Refuge within the Vast Swamp in Cormyr.\nThe monastery comprised three stone buildings and two support structures surrounding a central courtyard, connected by several staircases and walkways. The entirety of the premises was built atop a small hillock and was well-protected by both its elevation and mortared stone walls.\nA trail leading up from the nearby docks led to the monasterys gatehouse and adjoining stable, both of which had become dilapidated over time. The Dark Moon monks refectory was situated in the southeast end of the structure, and the priory was built on the elevation just north.\nThe northern structure housed the monks library, scriptorium, along with the Black Chapel. The roof over the chapel was capped with the large black dome that lent the monastery its name.\nthumb|right|350px|The monasterys gloom golem, standing before the Black Chapel.\nLike the outer structure, much of monasterys chambers were left in ruin. Doors were battered down, furniture was collapsed and useless, and debris lay scattered across nearly every room within. Any books or other valuables found amidst the ruins were relocated by the Cyricists to the temples priory, the single building that remained relatively intact. Overall the Ebon Spur had amassed a small fortune, worth over 5,000 gp\nThe monastery and its sinister trappings were wholly unsettling. Crumbling infrasttucture and ruined decor made for an uncomfortable place to stay. The constant murmurs and wails emanating from the Cyricists vigilant protector did little to encourage restfulness.\nOriginally, the temple was built as place of meditation for the monks of the Dark Moon, a sanctuary from which they could think upon the nature and significance of the Black Rift. After being rediscovered, it was rededicated to Cyric the Black Sun.\nTwo kir-lanans allied with Despayr and the Sharrans dwelled within the inner courtyard, serving as sentries and messnegers to the powerful black dragon.\nEthar and her Cyricists brought with them a gift in offering to Despayr, a gloom golem that remained within the monasterys Black Chapel. The terrifying construct served as their protector while staying within the Plane fo Shadow.\nAt some point in its history, the monastery was abandoned by the monk of the Dark Moon but remained a closely-guarded secret of their goddess Shar.\nDuring the late 14 century, the Cormyrean black dragon Despayr devised his plan to created a dead-magic zone over the Shadow Swamp in order rend the Weave in Shars name. To best fulfill his plan, the Nightmother directed him to utilize the Monastery of the Ebon Dome, \nWhen Despayr and the Sharrans began their ritual at the Black Rift, they employed a contingent Cyricist led by Bineera Ethar protectors to watch over and protect them from the monastery."
