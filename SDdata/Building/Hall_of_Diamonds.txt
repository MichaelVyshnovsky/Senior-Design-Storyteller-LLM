The '''Hall of Diamonds''' was a temple devoted to [[Waukeen]] found in [[Yhaunn]] in [[1358 DR]].

==Inhabitants==
High Priest [[Nicenor Rundeurl]] supervised a host of 23 other priests in the temple. In 1358 DR, with the sudden silence of Waukeen, the priests were scared and sought to hire [[mage]]s for protection and form any alliance that might benefit their organization. Many of the church followers deserted the temple, taking their wealth with them, during this time.
