The Hall of Diamonds was a temple devoted to Waukeen found in Yhaunn in 1358 DR.
High Priest Nicenor Rundeurl supervised a host of 23 other priests in the temple. In 1358 DR, with the sudden silence of Waukeen, the priests were scared and sought to hire mages for protection and form any alliance that might benefit their organization. Many of the church followers deserted the temple, taking their wealth with them, during this time.
