The '''Hojori Temple''' was a front for the activities of the famous assassin and spy [[Kumo]] clan of [[Kozakura]], many years before the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Hojori Temple was used by the Kumo clan many decades before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}. It was used to store the clan's treasures as well as a unique weapon that belonged to a master assassin â€“ ''[[Ryomaru's Harmless Staff]]''. Sometime later, the temple was burglarized by the renowned [[thief]] called "Chicken" [[Wu-Wei]], who got away with the temple's many treasures, including ''Ryomaru's Harmless Staff'', becoming the target of Kumo's wrath.
