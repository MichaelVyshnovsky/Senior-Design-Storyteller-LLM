'''The Roaring Griffon''' (once '''The Drowning Fish''') was an inn in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]].

==Location==
The inn stood in the south central portion of the westernmost islet, north of its docks. [[The Leaping Eel]] tavern was located across the street to the west.{{cite dungeon/113/Practical Magic|38}}

==Structure==
The Roaring Griffon was a three-story building. The common room, game room, and a tavern area were located on the first floor, along with a couple of private dining areas. The second floor housed most of the bedrooms, which were of good quality, but the uppermost floor contained truly excellent accommodations. The bedrooms were only accessible via staircases that were always protected by locked doors. Every room key also unlocked the correct stairwell door.

==Fare==
The inn was open from sunrise to midnight and tended to have a steady stream of business. Gregarious and chatty sailors and merchants were the normal clientele and it was said that Szwentil, a powerful merchant himself, bought the place mostly so that his customers would have a decent place to stay. As well as its quality and provender, it was popular for its location, close to both the docks and the city's western gate.

Every room was furnished with clean linens, candle lanterns, and warming pans. An [[aquatic elf]] [[bard]] named [[Zabados Dalamutha]] entertained patrons every day just before sunset.

==History==
Originally called The Drowning Fish, it was a festhall. It was revealed that the staff did good business drugging and robbing their patrons, before setting them adrift on the [[Dragonmere]] on rafts. When one of those patrons turned out to be an [[archmage]], there was a dramatic confrontation the following day when he woke up.

When Szwentil took over and renamed the place, he brought back a modicum of respectability, but some whispered that not all of the escorts who'd worked there when it was still the Fish had left.

Not long afterward, Szwentil sold the establishment (quite eagerly, by all accounts) to [[Hari Lorebb]], who ran it much the same way as Szwentil did.
