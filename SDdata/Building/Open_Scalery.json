Within a [[barrel]] of dried fish in this room the proprietors hid most of their wealth.\n\nThe front of the building was decorated with all manner of nautical paraphernalia, including [[net]]s and [[tar]]red [[rope]]s. There was a brine trough, where [[fish]] were cured before being dried, and a counter where the store's goods were sold. The counter had a glass front and shelves for displaying the day's catch. Sitting atop it were a [[balance scale]] and a cutting board.\n\nThe living quarters of the building consisted of three bedrooms, a parlor, and a kitchen. The parlor featured a fireplace with a hidden niche, wherein some of their [[currency|coins]] were hidden, as well as a variety of weapons on display. These included two [[cutlass]]es, a [[longsword]], a [[shortbow]], and two [[quiver]]s full of [[arrow]]s."
