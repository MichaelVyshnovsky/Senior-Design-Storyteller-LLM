==Location==
Chromatic Scale occupied the second floor of [[The Glitter Gala]], a jewelry shop, located on [[Wendserpent Street]],{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov – Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} down the street south from the [[Facemaker's Boutique]] and the [[Manor Gate]] of the [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]], which connected the Lower and [[Baldur's Gate/Upper City|Upper Cities]].

==Interior==

Inside, the Chromatic Scale displayed a collection of various musical instruments and [[music box]]es, with some being one-of-a-kind items, such as the ''[[Falataeric Cli lyre]]'', ''[[Glimmergad's Selgaunt fiddle]]'', ''[[Kiam Goda's kilat drum]]'', ''[[Stolyarof's table lute]]'', and ''[[Dostrealt's piccolo]].'' Its walls were decorated with posters advertising music, [[bard]]s, and [[minstrel]] services and the shop had a collection of songs, ballads, and other types of sheet music for sale.

==History==
[[File:Chromatic scale shop.jpg|thumb|''Chromatic Scale's interior.'']]
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, during the [[Absolute crisis]], the shop was run by [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]], a [[dragonborn]] man of crimson scales and a skilled instrument maker. Thomas was known to experiment on various materials in order to produce quality strings for his instruments. However, using [[peacock]] gizzards was a gross failure, [[rat]]gut was proven to be hard to work with, and [[cat]]gut was a failure, despite being better suited for string making than [[sheep]]sgut.
