In the , during the Absolute crisis, the shop was run by Thomas C. Quirkilious, a dragonborn man of crimson scales and a skilled instrument maker. Thomas was known to experiment on various materials in order to produce quality strings for his instruments. However, using peacock gizzards was a gross failure, ratgut was proven to be hard to work with, and catgut was a failure, despite being better suited for string making than sheepsgut.
