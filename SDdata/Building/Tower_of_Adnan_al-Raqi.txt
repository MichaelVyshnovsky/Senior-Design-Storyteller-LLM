The Tower of Adnan al-Raqi was located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
The Tower of Adnan al-Raqi could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.
This three-leveled tower was built for strength as well as education. The first level held a reception area and interview room where Adnan al-Raqi could talk with prospective students. A study room and the dormitory were also located here.
The second level housed the library, a lounge, a special conjuring room, and quarters for advanced students.
The third level of the tower held Adnans personal library, conjuring room, enchanting room, bedroom, and treasure room.
The tower walls were enchanted so creatures who traveled the ethereal plane could not pass through. The walls also barred any teleportation attempt. The only places to magically travel into or out of the tower were the conjuring rooms, and these were closely watched by dangerous guardian genies.
To become accepted as a student at the tower, an applicant needed to first survive Adnans favorite challenge—dropping the applicant into the middle of the Great Anvil to fend for themselves. Any student who returned to Adnan alive was accepted into the tower to begin their training. These students were required to pledge their service for 1,001 days.
Adnan kept 5–15 students in the tower at any given time.
Adnan specialized in the creation of genie prisons and dealing with genies. Students of the tower learned the dangerous and mysterious art of the shair from one of the best in the entire Land of Fate.
The Tower of Adnan al-Raqi was constructed in a single night with the help of several tasked architect genies.
