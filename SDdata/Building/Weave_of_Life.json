        "mainbody": "he Weave of Life was a shop in the Grand Souk marketplace of Port Nyanzaru, Chult, as of the late 15 century DR. It was owned and operated by Klevin VanSheran, a Tethyrian man obsessed with Chultan culture. \nThe storefront was a large stand with a sign displaying the shops name in both the Chultan and Common tongues. Klevin stood behind the main counter, and greeted customers first in Chultan and then in Common.\nThe shop sold a variety of decorative Chultan clothing&mdashlightweight and colorfully patterned shirts, kilts, pants, and sarongs&mdashand a wide range of trade goods, including trinkets, ivory sculptures, jewelry, and scarves. The entire inventory evoked local Chultan flavor and had clearly been curated by someone with a love for all things Chult. The shop also sold pamphlets authored by Klevin that discussed topics related to local traditions and customs.\nKlevin had arrived in Chult as an agent of the Lords Alliance, but he was generally more interested in his business than in the goals of his faction and would take the opportunity to try to sell his wares to any fellow operatives or adventurers before engaging in Alliance business.\nThe Weave of Life was a thriving business by 1490 DR. The most notable item for sale at this time was a life-size ivory carving of a Batiri battlestack."
