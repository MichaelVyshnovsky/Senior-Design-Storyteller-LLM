        "mainbody": "The Potters Wheel was a small shop located in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe shop was located in the far northwest corner of Daggerford on Wall Street next to Wayfels Smithy.\nThe shop was rather unimpressive. This was not an accident since the shop owner, Marcus, was an agent of the duke and couldnt care less about the success of the business."
