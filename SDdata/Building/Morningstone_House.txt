The Morningstone House was the local shrine to Lathander found in the small town of Asbravn. Both were situated in an out-of-the-way stretch of the Sunset Vale, in the valley where the Dusk Road intersected with the Uldoon Trail.
It was one of several smaller shrines, including those to Lliira and Waukeen, that encircled the larger, yet rundown temple of Ilmater.
