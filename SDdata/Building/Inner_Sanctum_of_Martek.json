        "mainbody": "The '''Inner Sanctum of Martek''' was the last part of the [[Tomb of Martek]]. It was only accessible after completing all of Martek's trials from the Cathedral in the [[Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|117}}",
        "Structure": "There were seven rooms in the Inner Sanctum. First was an entry hall, which could be accessed by placing all of the minarets in the Cathedral at the [[Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism]]. It had three flights of stairs; there was a fountain after the first, whose waters acted as a ''[[potion of extra healing]]'' up to once per day per drinker. Past the second flight of stairs were two side corridors leading to the Scroll Room and the Library Room. The last flight of stairs led towards the Entry Hall.\n\nThe entry hall led towards two rooms on the sides, the Scroll Room and the Library Room. Both rooms were symmetrical, with a flight of stairs leading to Martek's Vault. The scroll room held mostly nonmagical scrolls and curiosities, but its magical scrolls included a scroll of polymorph, a scroll of protection from undead, a scroll of protection from petrification, and several scrolls with four, five, and even seven spells. The Tomes of Martek included, of note, a book of infinite spells, a libram of gainful conjuration, a tome of clear thought, and a tome of understanding.\n\nAll three rooms, the Entry Hall, the Scroll Room, and the Library Room, led towards the Vault of Martek. It was a dark area with a domed ceiling, {{SI|100|feet}} high, with a round platform {{SI|20|feet}} high in the middle. The platform held the skeleton of a man wearing a crown from which three beams of light reflected unto the turbans of three {{SI|30|feet}} statues of djinn wearing great turbans and holding giant scimitars.\n\nFrom the Vault of Martek, his treasury lay straight north. In it, he had accumulated 9300 cp, 6400 ep, 17100 sp, 12400 gp, 2250 pp, and 20 gems, each worth 100 gp. There were also a number of magical treasures, including a wand of fireballs, a potion of clairaudience, a sword of nine lives stealing, a crystal ball, a shield enchanted to the pinnacle of magical protection, an enchanted scale mail, an enchanted morning star, a sword of dancing, and a very powerful ring of protection.\n\nTwo identical hidden rooms could be accessed from the Scroll and the Library Room. Those were small eight-sided rooms with a teleporter which could be made to lead anywhere the person thought of. It was, however, one-way only. The Star Gems of Martek could not be teleported through this method.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|128}}",
        "Defenses": "The Inner Sanctum was patrolled by the Guardians of Nephthys, an army whose sole purpose was to guard Martek's tomb. Amongst their forces numbered spectral minions, cryptknights, sphinxes, poisonous snakes, giant tarantulas, giant scorpions, mummies, necrophidi, cockatrices, and ghosts. Four cryptknights kept watch over the Vault of Martek. None of the Guardians would attack anyone bearing a [[Star Gem of Martek]].",
        "Inhabitants": "Besides the Guardians of Nephthys, only Martek was a permanent resident of the area.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1356}}, adventurers reached the inner sanctum and placed each [[Star Gem of Martek]] in slots within the turban of the genie statues, and on the platform holding Martek's bones. Martek was promptly revived; after thanking the adventurers, he set out to slay [[Khalitarius]], who had spent too much of his powers on both the men of the desert and battling [[Aeraldoth]] to fight off Martek's power.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|127}}"
