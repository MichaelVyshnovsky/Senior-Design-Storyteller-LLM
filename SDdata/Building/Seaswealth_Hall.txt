Seaswealth Hall was the guildhall of the Waterdhavian guild known as the Fishmongers Fellowship.
The Seaswealth Hall was located in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This guildhall stood two-stories tall. It was rather unassuming.
This guildhall controlled the citys lucrative open-air fish markets.
Like other guildhalls in the Dock Ward, it was considered by locals to be a landmark.
