        "mainbody": "rovers Field was a walled and gated pastured in the town of Mosstone reserved for steeds and beasts of burden of the caravans that moved up and down the Trade Way.\nDrovers Field was strategically nestled in the north-eastern corner of Mosstones city walls. Its position was selected so that constant sea wind carried the smell of beasts and manure away from the town. The enclosure was walled and guarded nightly, to protect caravans oxen from wolves and other hungry predators of the Forest of Tethir.\nDrovers Field stood just outside city gates on Rimmons Lane. Not far on the same street stood a quick stop-tavern named the Drovers Last Drink. It was a long old building lacking its front wall, keeping the place easily accessible to caravaners waiting for their beasts to be retrieved and ready for travel."
