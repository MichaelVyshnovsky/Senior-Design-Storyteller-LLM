        "mainbody": "Sundamars Tower was a mage tower found in Myth Drannor, and the personal residence of the eccentric wizard Sundamar.\nThe tower was located high above Eldansyrs Ride, in the citys Sheshyrinnam district.\nThe four-story stone tower was not built atop the ground, or even as an addition to one of the citys massive shadowtops, but rather appeared to grow out of the prolific and appropriately-named Towersclutch Tree.\nThe foundation of the tower rest some  above ground level, offering little protection against winds that regularly shook the branches of the tree, and the tower with them.\nSome people believed that the towers unique construction was not entirely intentional, and may have been a result of one of Sundamars failed experiments, perhaps one involving spelljamming-related magics."
