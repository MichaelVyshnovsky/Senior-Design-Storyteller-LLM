        "Structure": "The four-story stone tower was not built atop the ground, or even as an addition to one of the city's massive [[shadowtop]]s, but rather appeared to grow out of the prolific and appropriately-named Towersclutch Tree.\n\nThe foundation of the tower rest some {{SI|40|ft}} above ground level, offering little protection against winds that regularly shook the branches of the tree, and the tower with them.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some people believed that the tower's unique construction was not entirely intentional, and may have been a result of one of Sundamar's failed experiments, perhaps one involving [[spelljammer|spelljamming]]-related [[magic]]s."
