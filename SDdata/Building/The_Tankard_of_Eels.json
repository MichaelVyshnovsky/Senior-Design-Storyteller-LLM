        "mainbody": "The Tankard of Eels was a tavern in Marsember, Cormyr, operating around 1367 DR.\nIt took its name from a half-ogre patron who once drank a tankard of eels as a bet. The beverage was later removed from the menu.\nIt was clean, warm, and pleasant, and sold a good variety of ales, wines, and liquors, including zzar. Violence was rare here and it was a good place to hear gossip and news from the Sea of Fallen Stars area, although there was no official entertainment on offer, nor adornments. It was all talk.\nCategoryTaverns\nCategoryLocations in Marsember\nCategoryLocations in Cormyr\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\neomr474owo52enluqc751k57bzjjcpf"
