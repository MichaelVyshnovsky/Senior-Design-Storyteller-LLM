        "mainbody": "century DR\nTorleths Treasures was a shop in Gillians Hill, a hamlet along the Trade Way, that specialized in oddities, curios, antiques, and junk. It was owned by Torleth Mindulspeer in the 14 century DR.\nTorleths Treasures stood just off the northern patch of Trade Way that passed through the hamlet.\nTorleths Treasures was located in a chaotic-looking old barn. The main structure was expanded, seemingly at random in various directions over the years the store was in operation. Every expansion was done by a different set of hands and each part of the structure had different floors and roofs.\nTorleths office was a small room flooded with books to the right off the main entrance. The only way to access the basement was a door on the opposite part of the shop. The basement was a simple stone-covered hall with exit doors on each side, one led to the outside and another into the interior of Torleths Treasures. One gated room, the vault, was hidden behind a locked and trapped gate where Torleth kept his most precious items not intended for sale.\nThe stores sign hung on the side of the building by the front door. By 1372 DR, the sign looked battered by age and elements, spotted with flaking and washed-out paint, and screeched with un-oiled hinges.\nthumb|220px|The shops sign.\nThe patchwork interior was just as random as the shacks outside. Inside, rough tree trunks propped up the ceiling, while functioning as additional display, with many pegs holding up dangling merchandise. The interior of the shop was a labyrinth of curios and antiques of all types and sizes, leaving customers wandering poorly-lit passages in search of an exit.\nTorleth was a junk and antique enthusiast who loved to collecting old and strange things. He purchased \"garbage\" from derelict buildings, old ships, things excavated from ancient dungeons, and took them off the hands of traveling merchants from all corners of the Realms. His collection has such random items as a Valashar dancers mask, a Calishite harem mirror with an enchanted image of a snake circling in its glass, rope soaked in adventurers blood, old bottles filled with wine, presumably, lifted from the seabed, books in strange and unknown languages, a stuffed wyvern head with a single missing tooth, exotic clothings from other countries and regions, Torleth offered all these things and haggled for them happily. The store was also chock-filled with equipment that belonged to armies long-forgotten in the 14 century DR tents, polearms, giant and sprite helmets, a  long stirring oar, dragon teeth, stone lions, obscure coats of arms, coracles, ettercap silk glands, bodak teeth, seagull feathers, coldstones, quartz chunks, a saintsblood pearl, a bag of dust of disappearance, a stray chime of opening, and many more.\nTorleths Treasures was especially popular among thieves, actors, and bards for its collection of great costumes and historically accurate props.\nSome of the more unique items found in the store circa 1372 DR\n*Barrels of Bamboozle containers filled with fools gold-pyrite. They held sentimental value to Torleth and were not for sale.\n*Castaway Gourd a hollowed out giant gourd from the swamps of the Lizard Marsh with a carving of the word \"butterfly\" and curious history.\n*Curious Contraption that Goes Boing a strange contraption on a string recovered from the Tomb underneath Gillians Hill.\n*Dwarven belt of charming an ironically named magic belt that did the opposite of what its name suggested.\n*Glemp in Granite the defaced statue created by a local sculptor Yujist Glemp that once decorated the streets of Gillians Hill until the sculptors disseverance.\n*Haunted Armor a gold-plated piece of heavy armor that was haunted by ghosts of King Ulther and Prince Zherost.\n*Lady Oonaghs ludicrously loud lute an enchanted musical instrument that could make listeners ears bleed in excruciating pain.\n*Lord Alexs boundless beer stein magic ale stein that refilled itself with fresh frothy stout.\n*Lovers Boat the boat from the popular tragedy of young and doomed love between Galenia and Patrolio, often performed in theaters across the Sword Coast.\n*Mysterious Sea Creature Statue a large carved statue of a strange aquatic creature, or more likely a dolphin, from the Sea of Swords.\n*The Poets Song an enchanted scroll that held a ballad penned by an unknown bling poet from the world of Krynn.\n*Polly, a Stuffed Bird a stuffed parrot who once was a pirate captains lippy companion.\n*Wazus Wand a huge crystal rod-like item that that rippled with magic.\n*White Stag of Dargendale the famous example of taxidermy-a full-sized white deer, caught and stuffed by Worlges the Black.\n*An ancient key could be dug up from a pile of junk in Torleths Treasures circa 1372 DR. The keys unlocked gates to a temple of Metastakixx, a mysterious ancient mirror creature.\nThe locals loved tell stories and gossip about all the great finds accomplished in Torleths Treasures. The rumors were many and likely untrue as some claimed that a authentic crown of a barony from Vilhon Reach was once purchased from Torleth for 33 gold pieces, another tale told about an artists sketchbook that hid a rare spell hidden within its images-sold for 11 gp, a rare version of a ring of resistance, called Harvyns ring, was sold for 4,000 gp and the buyer later discovered additional magical properties, like the ability to use the spell jump and summon invisible swords that could cut through magical barriers."
