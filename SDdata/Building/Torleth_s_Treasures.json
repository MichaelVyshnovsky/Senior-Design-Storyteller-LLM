        "mainbody": "'''Torleth's Treasures''' was a shop in [[Gillian's Hill]], a hamlet along the [[Trade Way]], that specialized in oddities, curios, antiques, and junk. It was owned by [[Torleth Mindulspeer]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Torleth's Treasures stood just off the northern patch of Trade Way that passed through the hamlet.",
        "Structure": "Torleth's Treasures was located in a chaotic-looking old barn. The main structure was expanded, seemingly at random in various directions over the years the store was in operation. Every expansion was done by a different set of hands and each part of the structure had different floors and roofs.\n\nTorleth's office was a small room flooded with [[book]]s to the right off the main entrance. The only way to access the basement was a door on the opposite part of the shop. The basement was a simple stone-covered hall with exit doors on each side, one led to the outside and another into the interior of Torleth's Treasures. One gated room, the vault, was hidden behind a locked and trapped gate where Torleth kept his most precious items not intended for sale.\n\nThe store's sign hung on the side of the building by the front door. By 1372 DR, the sign looked battered by age and elements, spotted with flaking and washed-out [[paint]], and screeched with un-[[oil]]ed [[hinge]]s.",
        "Interior": "[[File:Torleth's Treasures sign.png|thumb|220px|''The shop's sign.'']]\nThe patchwork interior was just as random as the shack's outside. Inside, rough tree trunks propped up the ceiling, while functioning as additional display, with many pegs holding up dangling merchandise. The interior of the shop was a labyrinth of curios and antiques of all types and sizes, leaving customers wandering poorly-lit passages in search of an exit.",
        "Services": "Torleth was a junk and antique enthusiast who loved to collecting old and strange things. He purchased \"garbage\" from derelict buildings, old ships, things excavated from ancient [[dungeon]]s, and took them off the hands of traveling merchants from all corners of the [[Realms]]. His collection has such random items as a [[Valashar (kingdom)|Valashar]] dancer's mask, a [[Calishite]] harem [[mirror]] with an enchanted image of a [[snake]] circling in its [[glass]], [[rope]] soaked in [[adventurer]]s' blood, old [[bottle]]s filled with [[wine]], presumably, lifted from the seabed, books in strange and unknown languages, a stuffed [[wyvern]] head with a single missing tooth, exotic clothings from other countries and regions, Torleth offered all these things and haggled for them happily. The store was also chock-filled with equipment that belonged to armies long-forgotten in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]: [[tent]]s, [[polearm]]s, [[giant]] and [[sprite]] [[helmet]]s, a {{SI|50'|'\"|long=yes}} long stirring [[oar]], [[dragon]] teeth, stone [[lion]]s, obscure coats of arms, [[coracle]]s, [[ettercap]] [[silk]] glands, [[bodak]] teeth, [[seagull]] feathers, [[coldstone]]s, [[quartz]] chunks, a ''[[saintsblood pearl]]'', a bag of ''[[dust of disappearance]]'', a stray ''[[chime of opening]]'', and many more.\n\nTorleth's Treasures was especially popular among [[thieves]], actors, and [[bard]]s for its collection of great costumes and historically accurate props.\n\nSome of the more unique items found in the store ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]:\n*[[Barrels of Bamboozle]]: containers filled with fool's gold-[[pyrite]]. They held sentimental value to Torleth and were not for sale.\n*[[Castaway Gourd]]: a hollowed out giant [[gourd]] from the swamps of the [[Lizard Marsh]] with a carving of the word \"[[butterfly]]\" and curious history.\n*''[[Curious Contraption that Goes Boing]]'': a strange contraption on a string recovered from the Tomb underneath Gillian's Hill.\n*''[[Dwarven belt of charming]]'': an ironically named magic [[belt]] that did the opposite of what its name suggested.\n*''[[Glemp in Granite]]'': the defaced statue created by a local sculptor [[Yujist Glemp]] that once decorated the streets of Gillian's Hill until the sculptor's disseverance.\n*''[[Haunted Armor]]'': a [[gold]]-plated piece of [[heavy armor]] that was haunted by [[ghost]]s of King [[Ulther]] and Prince [[Zherost]].\n*''[[Lady Oonagh's ludicrously loud lute]]'': an enchanted musical instrument that could make listeners' ears bleed in excruciating pain.\n*''[[Lord Alex's boundless beer stein]]'': magic [[ale]] stein that refilled itself with fresh frothy [[stout]].\n*''[[Lovers' Boat]]'': the boat from the popular tragedy of young and doomed love between [[Galenia]] and [[Patrolio]], often performed in theaters across the Sword Coast.\n*Mysterious Sea Creature Statue: a large carved statue of a strange aquatic creature, or more likely a [[dolphin]], from the [[Sea of Swords]].\n*''[[The Poet's Song]]'': an enchanted [[scroll]] that held a ballad penned by an unknown bling poet from the world of [[Krynn]].\n*[[Polly]], a Stuffed Bird: a stuffed [[parrot]] who once was a [[pirate]] captain's lippy companion.\n*''[[Wazu's Wand]]'': a huge crystal [[rod]]-like item that that rippled with magic.\n*[[White Stag of Dargendale]]: the famous example of taxidermy-a full-sized white [[deer]], caught and stuffed by [[Worlges|Worlges the Black]].\n*An ancient key could be dug up from a pile of junk in Torleth's Treasures ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. The keys unlocked gates to a temple of [[Metastakixx]], a mysterious ancient mirror creature.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The locals loved tell stories and gossip about all the great finds accomplished in Torleth's Treasures. The rumors were many and likely untrue as some claimed that a authentic crown of a barony from [[Vilhon Reach]] was once purchased from Torleth for 33 [[gold]] pieces, another tale told about an artist's sketchbook that hid a rare spell hidden within its images-sold for 11 [[gp]], a rare version of a ''[[ring of resistance]]'', called ''[[Harvyn's ring]]'', was sold for 4,000 gp and the buyer later discovered additional magical properties, like the ability to use the spell ''[[jump]]'' and summon invisible [[sword]]s that could cut through magical barriers."
