        "mainbody": "The '''Tower of Seven Woes''' was a structure on [[Skull Island]] in [[Skullport]].",
        "Location": "The Tower of Seven Woes was hewn from a massive stalactite, which appeared as though it pierced the upper halls of the prison at the southern end of Skull Island.",
        "Structure": "The tower derived its name from the seven levels carved into the heart of the stalactite, each symbolizing a particular form of suffering in devotion to [[Loviatar]], the goddess of pain and suffering. While the details of the upper six levels were kept secret, the first was known as the Agony of Frost and Fire.",
        "Activities": "The Tower of Seven Woes was regarded with even greater fear than the notorious [[School of Obedience]].\n\nIt was the site where [[Quinan Varnaed]], the leader of the [[Iron Ring]], conducted rituals dedicated to his deity, Loviatar. These services, steeped in blood and agony, were held with the assistance of four additional [[priest]]s, though they operated discreetly to avoid drawing the attention of the [[Skulls of Skullport]]. On holy days dedicated to Loviatar, the tower resounded with the screams of the tormented, their cries echoing across the Port and striking fear into all who heard them.",
        "Defenses": "The Tower of Seven Woes was defended by a contingent of [[gargoyle]]s and [[margoyle]]s that patrolled the skies around the stalactite. They were magically bound to obey Quinan Varnaed, serving as guardians, scouts, and even personal messengers. Rivals of Varnaed had, on more than one occasion, been attacked and carried into the air by them, only to be delivered to the cruel mercies of the tower's master."
