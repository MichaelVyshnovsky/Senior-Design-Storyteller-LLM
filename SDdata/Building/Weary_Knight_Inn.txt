The roadhouse stood across the street and to the east from the Citadel. The citys Eastgate was three blocks away. Immediately to the east from the Weary Knight Inn stood grand villa of the noble House Marliir and further west&mdashthe Ladys House, Arabels temple of Tymora.
The Weary Knight was a roadhouse with sizable stables attached to the main building.
The inns rooms had strongly-smelling straw-filled mattresses. Some believed that the horses used the straw before it was used for stuffing. The establishment had several kitchens filled with smoke and aromas of cooking. The main huge dining area of the inn had high ceilings and held the inns namesake next to a wall. The Weary Knight was an antique unopened carved tomb recovered from a temple pyre several centuries fever the 14 century DR. The tomb was carved of stone with an image of a lying knight on the tombs lid. The human knights image was carved adorned in armor. His hand was placed on his chest while the other was at his side. From afar, the tomb looked like a sleeping man.
No one was allowed to touch or tamper with the sealed stone coffin. It was sealed with lead making it hard to pry open, and anyone who tried faced the wrath of Arabels leader&mdashMyrmeen Lhal.
The most notable thing about the Knight was its pleasant and exuberant atmosphere. The innkeeper in the mid-to-late 14 century DR was Alanaerle. She was a big woman with a face that scared children. Despite her looks, she was a pleasant company and a jolly host who loved sad love stories and ballads with happy endings. She never failed to fill the inns common room with traveling minstrels, singers, bards, and storytellers. She cut prices in half in exchange for performances. This guaranteed the Knight filled with sorrowful ballads and lively tales on the daily.
The inn offered the usual service of food, drink, lodgings, and music to its guests. Alanaerle prepared a cozy parlor on the other side of the common room for those who considered sad ballads unappealing. Those who chose to eat there were spared from romantic moaning of overly-eloquent bards.
Regularly priced room and a meal costed guests two gold coins, while entertainers were charged only a single gold.
