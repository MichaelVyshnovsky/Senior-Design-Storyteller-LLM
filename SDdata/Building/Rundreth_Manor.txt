'''Rundreth Manor''' was a ruined mansion-house located in the [[Dessarin Valley]], within the [[Savage Frontier]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was the residence of the [[shadow dragon]] [[Nurvureem]], who took the disguise of an enigmatic persona known as "the Dark Lady".

==Geography==
The manor was situated on a small hill that lay on the east side of the [[Long Road]], which it overlooked. It was less than a day's travel north of [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]], in the southern part of the Dessarin Valley.

==Structure==
Before its fall to ruin, Rundreth Manor was truly a splendid sight. The stone manse was three floors, with a foundation that resembled a capital-letter "T", top of which pointed eastward. As of the late 15{{th}} century, its roof and several of its walls were collapsed. The manor house's two wings were nearly demolished and covered in overgrowth.

Beneath the mansion was a crypt, within which Nurvureem made her lair. It had a ceiling comprised of a series of vaulted arches, the integrity of which had been compromised by the root-network of the trees that had taken hold above.

==History==
Months before the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, a delegated of representatives from several of the various cults of elemental evil, those being the [[Cult of the Black Earth|Black Earth]], [[Cult of the Crushing Wave|Crushing Wave]], [[Cult of the Eternal Flame|Eternal Flame]] and the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred|Howling Hatred]], paid a visit to Nurvureem within her lair. She slew and devoured most of the cultists, but let a few live so their organization would not bother her again.

==Inhabitants==
Nurvureem lived in the manor alone, under the guise of the [[drow]] woman known locally as "the Dark Lady".
