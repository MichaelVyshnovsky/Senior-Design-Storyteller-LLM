        "mainbody": "he Stonehill Inn was a quaint inn in the village of Phandalin.\nThe modest inn was located close to the center of town.\nNewly built in the 15 century DR, the inn was a large, two-story building was made of unrefined rocks and crudely cut wood.\nThe villagers of Phandalin, from miners to farmers, enjoyed relaxing in the common room, which became a good place to hear local gossip and stories.\nThe Stonehill Inn was owned by Toblen Stonehill, who operated it alongside his wife Trilena Stonehill and with help from his son Pip Stonehill.\nThe inn provided six rentable rooms on the upper floor, plus alcoholic beverages and food. A bed was five silver pieces a night, and prices were fairly standard for food, ale, and cider, with meals coming to about 1 silver piece. A barmaid called Elsa served drinks at the bar.\nThe Stonehills arrived in Phandalin from Triboar early in the construction of the town, and founded the inn around 1490 DR. During the Redbrands reign of terror throughout Phandalin in 1491 DR, the bandits did not frequent the inn, preferring to drink at the Sleeping Giant a few buildings to the east.\nBusiness continued more-or-less as usual during the rampage of the white dragon Cryovain across the countryside. The inn played host to important visitors during this time, such as Don-Jon Raskin, the man who was in charge of reopening the Mountains Toe gold mines. The inns common room also became a favorite haunt for Argus Skeel, a vampire spawn in service to the necromancer Ularan Mortus.\nBy 1496 DR, the inn remained prosperous and largely unchanged. However, at some point the Stonehills had borrowed money from the town banker and former townmaster, Harbin Wester, and he was attempting to leverage the small amount they still owed to take away their business."
