        "mainbody": "he Peg and Hook was a shop in Luskan that sold unusual prosthetics, founded sometime in the late 15 Century DR by Arla Razortongue.\nUnusual for a prosthetics shop, the Peg and Hook sold hooks meant to be worn in place of a missing leg and peg legs meant to be worn in place of a missing hand. The shop also sold a variety of attachments for both that added extra functionality. Arla charged a flat rate of 25 gold pieces for a limb replacement, offering no interest payment plans.\nArla Razortongue founded this business sometime after having been fired from Dran Enterprises. Her former colleagues had no faith in her unusual business venture and paid it no heed, but Arla managed to convince enough pirates to try out her prosthetics that the Peg and Leg began to thrive.\nBy 1496 DR, the shop was well known among the inhabitants of Luskan. Around this year a group of adventurers working for Acquisitions Incorporated entered the Peg and Hook in search of a lead on where in Luskan the secret headquarters of Dran Enterprises was located. Assuming them to be customers, Arla pointed out of many the products within her shop before pulling out a bonesaw and asking which of them she could service. She was disappointed to learn that they werent actually interested in her products, but was open to providing them the information they sought in search of a fee, as she was looking to expand the business."
