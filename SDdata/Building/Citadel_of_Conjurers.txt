The '''Citadel of Conjurers''', originally known as '''Dun-Orthass''', was a dark tower, located within the foothills of the [[Earthspur Mountains]] at the mouth of the [[Moaning Gorge]], that was built in the final years of the [[Narfell]]i empire.{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|56-71}}

==Description==
The citadel was constructed from black stone. Beneath the tower proper was a labyrinthine series of secluded chambers and catacombs that were believed to hold a number of [[artifact]]s and treasures from Narfell. 

Deep within these subterranean passageways was the [[Hall of the Hidden Throne]], a massive [[demoncyst]] that formed around the ruined palace of the [[demon prince]] [[Eltab]], which had been wrenched from [[Hidden Layer|his lair]] in [[the Abyss]] by the [[Nar demonbinder]]s. The ''[[adamantine binding]]'' was a powerful ''calling circle'' that bound Eltab to [[Toril]], and maintained a permanent connection between the fiends of the Hidden Layer to the lands of former Narfell. It was believed that only the legendary [[greatsword]] of [[Rashemen]], ''[[Hadryllis]]'', could shatter this binding.

The [[sage]]s of [[Faerûn]] identified the citadel as a powerful [[evil node]]. [[Faerûn]]ian demonologists and experts of fiendish lore believed the halls of the citadel to be infested with [[demon]]ic activity. 

==History==
The citadel was constructed in the [[-153 DR|Year of the Starry Shroud, −153 DR]], built around the Hall of the Hidden Throne, in the waning years of ancient Narfell. The site of the tower was positioned over the demoncyst that tethered Eltab to the [[Prime Material plane]]; it had been conjured in the [[-160 DR|Year of the Stone Giant, −160 DR]] by Nentyarch [[Rheligaun]], and the empire's demonbinders. 

When the [[Great Conflagration (event)|Great Conflagration]] erupted between Narfell and [[Raumathar]] the [[-152 DR|following year]], the Nentyarch and many Nar refugees fled to the citadel and met some unknown fate. It was believed that many of them were hunted down and sealed away by vindictive [[Raumathari battlemage]]s who sought vengeance upon their former countrymen.

Some time before the [[-148 DR|Year of the Black Marble, −148 DR]], the secrets of the ''adamantine binding'' were revealed to the Nentyarch, either by fiendish whispers that were directed through the ''[[Crown of Narfell]]'' or by the Demon Prince [[Orcus]] himself. Eltab was released from the bindings beneath the citadel and let loose upon the countries of the [[Unapproachable East]].

Throughout the ages, many [[Impiltur]]an heroes, among them [[Sarshel Elethlim|King Sarshel "the True"]] and [[Nord|King Nord]], walked the dark halls of the citadel and returned to the kingdom and shared their tales.

Before he ascended as king, Sarshel Elethlim defeated the demonic army of the [[balor]] [[Ndulu]] at the citadel in the [[731 DR|Year of Visions, 731 DR]], ending both the [[Fiend Wars]] and the [[Triad Crusade]]. The brave [[paladin]] ventured into the tower and destroyed the [[artifact]] known as the ''Crown of Narfell''. This act weakened Orcus' influence over the region, scattered Ndulu's demons and released the souls of the deceased Nentyarchs that were trapped within the crown.

Over the next 50 years, Ndulu collected these errant spirits, bound them to the newly forged ''[[Moaning Crown of Ndulu]]'' and raised another army of [[succubi]] and [[glabrezu]]. The demon general was stopped at the citadel once again, in the [[786 DR|Year of the Moaning Gorge, 786 DR]], by the [[Paladin Princes]] of Impiltur. Ndulu was defeated once and for all in the [[Battle of Moaning Gorge]] and banished through a ''[[portal|vortex portal]]'' to the Abyss. The ''Moaning Crown'' was left on Toril, indestructible by any means known to the Impilturan knights or [[wizard]]s. [[Nord|Prince Nord]] ventured deep into the citadel,

During the final years of the [[Heltharn Dynasty]], in the [[1373 DR|Year of the Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], Eltab returned to the Citadel of Conjurers after over 400 years of imprisonment and manipulation in the southern realm of [[Thay]].
