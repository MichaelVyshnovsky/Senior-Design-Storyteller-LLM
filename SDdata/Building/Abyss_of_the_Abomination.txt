The '''Abyss of the Abomination''' was a temple dedicated to [[Moander]], the Rotting God.

==Location==
This subterranean temple was located deep within the earth beneath [[Yûlash]]. A deep shaft hidden within a warehouse provided the only access to the temple.

==Description==
The mouth of the pit was surrounded by large fangs.

==History==
Following Moander's destruction, the temple and Moander's faithful were tolerated by the [[Red Plumes]] of [[Hillsfar]] by the use of well-placed bribes.

==Activities==
The citizens of Yûlash used the pit to dump refuse in exchange for paying a fee to the cult.
