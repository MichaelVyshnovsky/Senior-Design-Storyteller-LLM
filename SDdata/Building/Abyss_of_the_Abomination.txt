The Abyss of the Abomination was a temple dedicated to Moander, the Rotting God.
This subterranean temple was located deep within the earth beneath Yûlash. A deep shaft hidden within a warehouse provided the only access to the temple.
The mouth of the pit was surrounded by large fangs.
Following Moanders destruction, the temple and Moanders faithful were tolerated by the Red Plumes of Hillsfar by the use of well-placed bribes.
The citizens of Yûlash used the pit to dump refuse in exchange for paying a fee to the cult.
