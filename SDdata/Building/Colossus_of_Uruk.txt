}}The '''Colossus of Uruk''' was a gigantic [[granite]] statue found on the northern tip of the island of [[Sahu]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]] of [[east Zakhara]] in the early 1400s [[DR]].{{Ne-time}}

==Description==
The Colossus stood atop a high plateau overlooking the [[Horn of Sahu]] and the [[Crowded Sea]]. The statue stood {{SI|150|ft}} tall. In [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} the statue was overgrown with vegetation and birds' nests.

The inside of the statue was hollow and contained numerous chambers including a small library. The walls within the head of the statue were lined with [[gold]] to further enhance the light output.

==Powers==
The main light source for the Colossus was actually a massive imprisoned [[fire elemental]].

==History==
The Colossus was initially erected by the [[Necromancer Kings]] to serve as a lighthouse for the island to protect incoming ships from the dangerous reefs. The eyes in the head of the statue used to contain magical lenses that would augment light.

In 1367 DR, the philosopher [[Kazerabet]] used the library to further her research.
