'''The Rat's Nest''' was a [[tavern]] in [[Hillsfar]] and popular hangout for off-duty [[Red Plumes]].

==Activities==
The combination of cheap [[ale]] and brawny occupants often led to military brawls breaking out on a regular basis in the Rat's Nest. Visitors of the tavern who weren't associated with the Red Plumes needed to be wary as criminals in Hillsfar often ended up in the [[Hillsfar Arena|Arena]].
