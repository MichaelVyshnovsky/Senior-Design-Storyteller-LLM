        "mainbody": "ouse of the Waves was a temple dedicated to Trishina in the aquatic elf city of Myth Nantar.\nThis temple stood along Chamal Avenue, in the Elves Quarter of Myth Nantar. Like all temples in Myth Nantar, there was a  perimeter around the building that was free of coral. The coral that grew around this boundary, which was clearly defined as if moving around a force field, was always as smooth as silk.\nThis temple stood two stories tall."
