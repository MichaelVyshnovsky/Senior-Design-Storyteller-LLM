'''The Vulgar Monkey''' was a single-floored tavern located in the center of [[Brynnlaw]].

==Interior==
The tavern had a small entryway to the main area, which also served as a kitchen. It had a single stove, and a few tables displaying bread and other goods. The main area contained a bar with surrounding stools, as well as many tables and chairs.

===Atmosphere===
Sailors, pirates, and [[courtesan (prostitute)|courtesans]] mainly occupied the Vulgar Monkey. The sailors, often very drunk, could be found singing hearty songs about their voyages across the seas.

==Services==
Rooms suitable for peasants and merchants could be rented out for the night. Baked goods and several different types of beers, mead, and wine were sold here.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], the trader, [[Sanik]], was assassinated in the tavern.
