Baeremars Stargirt Stallion was an inn in Archtassel in Tasseldale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
This quaint and quiet inn was located in such a way it provided a great view of the tassel for guests. Guests were treated with fresh soup made every morning. The inn was known for its collection of exotic teas. If one was willing to part with their coin, they could add sweetened cocoa from Maztica to their beverage. Served with the tea were small biscuits and a selection of spreads made from butter mixed with local herbs and vegetables.
The inn displayed and sold items and crafts made by the residents of Archtassel. A pool behind the inn was warded against insects, allowing both guests and staff a chance to bathe or cool down in peace.
The inn was small and cramped, and only a dozen guests could stay at any given time. The inn did not see many travelers, locals were the primary patrons. The relief-carved sign that hung outside the inn was enchanted so the stars, which were just bumps in the wood, sparkled and twinkled.
