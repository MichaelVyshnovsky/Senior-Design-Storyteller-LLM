The monastery's inhabitants were the seven stone monks who possessed powers of divine nature. One notable creation of the seven monks was ''[[Myo-Myo's gong]]'', an enchanted [[shield]] and a [[gong]] wielded by a famous [[ghost]] hunter [[Myo-Myo]]. The seven stone monks etched the gong with geometric patterns and imbued it with the sacred power to perform ''[[holy smite]]'."
