The Cracked Crown was an elegant inn found in Phlan in 1367 DR.
The inn was located near the center of the city.
The inn derived its name from a bronze cracked crown that adorned the doorway.
This quiet inn was actually too quiet for the likes of most laborers and adventurers. It was run by Robyrtah Greensash. 10 gp here paid for a meal with drink and a bed for the night.
It was still in business around 1489 DR.
