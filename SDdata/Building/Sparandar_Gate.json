Sparandar Gate, in turn, was the only entrance into the Grave District from outside of Athkatla.\nAll non-citizens who passed Cold Dolor Gate had to pay an \"any one coin\" toll, of gold or silver, to be allowed into the main body of Athkatla, however, passage through Sparandar Gate was unrestricted by such means, allowing guests access to the city cemetery."
