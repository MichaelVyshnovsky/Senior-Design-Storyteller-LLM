This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes.  Additionally, being a major torchtower, it had six small holding cells that could hold up to ten people, which were used in times of trouble.\nLike all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.\nEast Torch Tower, like all torchtowers, was manned by members of the City Watch."
