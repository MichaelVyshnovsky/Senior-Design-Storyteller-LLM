The Thieves Brotherhood was the meeting place that was used by the local thieves guild that operated in Daggerford during the late 14 century DR.
It was located in the Farmers Quarter of Daggerford
The stone building was pointedly uninviting. The only entrance was a single doorway flanked by small windows that were secured with bars.
The thieves of Daggerford used this building as their main headquarters. They also utilized a number of nearby buildings that were believed by others to be uninhabited.
