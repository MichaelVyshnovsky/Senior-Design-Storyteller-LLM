        "mainbody": "The '''Old Dragon Down''' was a small pawnshop located in the city of [[Archenbridge]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The shop was located on the intersection between Urserpent Street and the road coming from the Arkhen Bridge, across the street from the [[Old Stonebows]] inn.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The shop was frequented by [[adventurers]] looking to sell their spoils, and by shady [[mercenary|sellswords]] sharing stories while waiting for work."
        },
        "Services": "The Old Dragon Down bought and sold [[relic]]s of [[Myth Drannor]], as well as small magical baublesâ€”for example, lamps that glowed without fuel and cloaks that could float in the air to provide a cover against rain.\n\nIt also served as a pawnshop, mostly frequented by unlucky adventurers. Finally it was known as the place to go for anyone looking to hire rough folk for a few coins, who weren't adverse to illegal activities such as bullying opponents or small-time thievery.",
        "History": "The name and signboard of the shop were inspired by the defeat of [[Arkhenthus]], the Mage Devourer, a ancient [[white dragon]] slain in [[Arkhen Vale]] by [[Elminster]] and his companions."
