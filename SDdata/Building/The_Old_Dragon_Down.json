        "mainbody": "he Old Dragon Down was a small pawnshop located in the city of Archenbridge during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. \nThe shop was located on the intersection between Urserpent Street and the road coming from the Arkhen Bridge, across the street from the Old Stonebows inn.\nThe shop was small, cramped, and badly lit.\nThe shop was frequented by adventurers looking to sell their spoils, and by shady sellswords sharing stories while waiting for work.\nThe Old Dragon Down bought and sold relics of Myth Drannor, as well as small magical baublesâ€”for example, lamps that glowed without fuel and cloaks that could float in the air to provide a cover against rain.\nIt also served as a pawnshop, mostly frequented by unlucky adventurers. Finally it was known as the place to go for anyone looking to hire rough folk for a few coins, who werent adverse to illegal activities such as bullying opponents or small-time thievery.\nThe name and signboard of the shop were inspired by the defeat of Arkhenthus, the Mage Devourer, a ancient white dragon slain in Arkhen Vale by Elminster and his companions."
