Hengorot, or Mead Hall, was a meeting place in Settlestone for barbarians of the Tribe of the Elk.
The stone building was huge and could house over 800 inhabitants. Only half of Hengorot was crafted from stone the rest had deerskin canopies.
Like Settlestone itself, Mead Hall was a place where women and children were servants catering to the villages male population by serving drinks and cooking food. Women were allowed to sit at the huge table, but only in the laps of the drinking barbarian men.
Between 1357 DR and 1358 DR, the Icewind Dale barbarians began building Mead Hall as a permanent structure in Settlestone.
