'''Hengorot''', or '''Mead Hall''', was a meeting place in [[Settlestone]] for [[barbarian]]s of the [[Tribe of the Elk]].

==Structure==
The stone building was huge and could house over 800 inhabitants. Only half of Hengorot was crafted from stone; the rest had deerskin canopies.

==Activities==
Like Settlestone itself, Mead Hall was a place where women and children were servants catering to the village's male population by serving drinks and cooking food. Women were allowed to sit at the huge table, but only in the laps of the drinking barbarian men.

==History==
Between [[1357 DR]] and [[1358 DR]], the [[Icewind Dale]] barbarians began building Mead Hall as a permanent structure in Settlestone.
