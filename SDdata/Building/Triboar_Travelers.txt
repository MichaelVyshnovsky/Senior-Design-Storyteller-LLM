The '''Triboar Travelers''' was a caravaneer company that operated out of the town of [[Triboar]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was run by the cunning businessman, and proud [[Zhentarim]] recruiter, [[Urlam Stockspool]].

==Location==
It lay in the center of town,<ref> just west of the [[Caravan campgrounds (Triboar)|west caravan campground]].

==Services==
The company offered wagons for rent to merchants who needed to transport their goods to nearby towns and cities. They also provided guards, using only hired [[mercenaries]] and [[adventurer]]s, to protect the caravans that comprised these wagons, to ensure their arrival and secure the accompanying payment. Under Urlam, the caravan guards were often also Zhentarim.

;Prices:
* Return trip to [[Waterdeep]]: 600 [[gp]] plus 25 gp for every wagon after the 10{{th}}
* Return trip to [[Everlund]]: 800 gp plus 30 gp for every wagon after the 10{{th}} Prices were higher for the greater risk of monster attack.

;Payments:
* Guards were paid 4 gp per day, plus food and drink. They could receive a 25 gp bonus upon safe arrival of the caravan, with no lost goods or clientele.
