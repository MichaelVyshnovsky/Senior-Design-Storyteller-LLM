        "mainbody": "Danthelons Dancing Axe was a general store located on Wyrms Crossing in Baldurs Gate. It sold good quality secondhand wares, from pots and pans to rope, armor, and weapons.\nThe buildings main floor was the shop, just past the main entrance that faced the center of Wyrms Crossing. The room was filled with shelves and displays of various types and sizes. Visitors could see weapons hung on the walls, armor and other more expensive items locks in display cages and cases, bookshelves filled with books, and a large taxidermy bear.\nDanthelons sold second-hand goods, from armor and weapons, to mundane coils of rope. The shop also carried ever-popular limited edition adventuring starter packs. Occasionally, some more curious items found a way into the dwarfs inventory, including gauntlets of the warmaster, horns of the berserker, snow-dusted monastery gloves, cloaks of displacement, and unique items such as the Garb of the Land and Sky, the Blightbringer and a harmonic dueller.\nIt was run by Entharl Danthelon, the shield dwarf proprietor who claimed to be a retired adventurer. Circa the late 15 century DR, Danthelon employed a duo of half-orcish bodyguardsâ€“Somi and his brother. Secretly, Entharl Danthelon offered his shops cellar to the local Harper cell to be used a safehouse and the bodyguards ensured no city guard nor steel watcher bothered the \"guests.\" The High Harper Jaheira was one of the agents who used the safehouse and was well accounted with the Dancing Axes proprietor.\nThe shop earned its name from a \"magically-floating axe\" that protected the premises at night. According to Danthelon himself, the axe was a gift from a particularly grateful elven princess.\nIn fact, the \"axe\" was actually a tamed stirge that had been modified with illusion-magic by Yssra."
