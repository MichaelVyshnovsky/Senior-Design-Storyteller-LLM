        "mainbody": "The Moonlit Touch was a festhall and nightclub in the city of Arabel in Cormyr in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was highly recommended by Volothamp Geddarm.\nThe club was located in the southwestern quadrant of the city, on the same street as the shop of Daglar Maermeet, an armorer.\nThe Moonlit Touch sold a very large assortment of quality beverages for fair prices. Food was free with entrance and was served on platters carried around by staff. The platters contained a variety of greasy handfoodsâ€”for example, deep-fried breaded quail or drumsticks made from turkey.\nEscort services were available here, but guests negotiated prices with the individual escorts.\nThe Touch was primarily a dance club. Attendees spent most of their time dancing around the establishment, accompanied by happy music from the resident minstrels, sometimes while bearing candle lamps. Some older men in the city were known to come to the club simply to drink and to people-watch the younger dancers. (One such observer in 1368 DR was a retired high-ranking Purple Dragon officer, who knew many rumors about Arabel, the Zhentarim, lost treasures, bandits, and even weredragons.)"
