Anasturs Abrasives was a prospecting and polish-making business in Llorkh in the 15 century DR.
Baelen Anastur sent out human and gnome prospectors across the Delimbiyr Vale to find particular minerals such as manganese and iron oxides, mixed with secret blends of oils to make fine abrasive polishes. It was linked by merchants map to Samrils Fine Blades in Secomber, who used their polishes for finishing the raw blades of Arthane Furnace products such as longswords.
