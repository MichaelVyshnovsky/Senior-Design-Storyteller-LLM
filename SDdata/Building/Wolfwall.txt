The '''Wolfwall''' was a defensive wall surrounding the [[hamlet]] of [[White Ford]] in [[Archendale]].

==Name==
The Wolfwall earned its name by repelling wild animals (including [[wolves]]) in winter and brigands ("two-legged wolves", metaphorically speaking) in summer.

==Structure==
The Wolfwall encircled the hamlet in an ovoid ring, linking the strongholds of [[Arch Hold]] and [[Beacon Tor]].

While the gates of the Wolfwall were generally left open, the Archenriders could close them anytime at their discretion to inspect suspicious guests of the hamlet or gather passage bribes.

==Defenses==
Despite having a firing platform on its inner surface and ladder platforms spaced along the wall, as of [[1370 DR]], the Wolfwall no longer held weapons ready, owing to constant theft of weaponry.

==Rumors & Legends==
There were speculations that a segment of the Wolfwall close to Beacon Tor might be a [[living wall]] or some other deadly being. It was believed that it absorbed anyone who dared to touch the wall, drawing them into the wall and sustaining itself by draining their life and body. Even some Archenriders were influenced by that rumor and refused to inspect the supposed part of the wall.

According to local tales, an Arkhen [[warrior]] acquired in battle an ancient [[orc]] tribal [[relic]], the [[talking bone]], letting its holder to talk to an [[Gruumsh|orc god]], whose name was forgotten in the hamlet. After the battle, orcs eager to reclaim the artifact appeared two or three times a day to challenge him for it. Eventually, the warrior grew weary of the constant challenges and decided to conceal the talking bone within the Wolfwall. The residents of White Ford strongly disapproved of anyone dismantling their protective wall in pursuit of this relic.
