Wylers Bell was a small and nondescript inn found in Phlan in 1367 DR.
The inn was located near the center of the city.
The inn was in fact little more than a cheap dive with a large common room for guests to sleep in on the second floor. The bland food and cheap ale attracted customers with little coin to spend.
Named for the former owner Nat Wyler, the inns biggest attraction was the body of the deceased Old Nat himself that was displayed as a piece of mortuary art behind the bar gripping a bronze bell in his hands.
