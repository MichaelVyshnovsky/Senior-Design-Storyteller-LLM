        "mainbody": "The '''Arena beneath Llorkh''' was a fighting pit located under [[Llorkh]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The arena was constructed far beneath Llorkh, and one of its tunnel entrances was connected to the [[Griffon's Grange]] tavern.",

            "Atmosphere": "Those who visited the arena were said to have a sick kind of humor."

        "Services": "The large fighting pit held many thousands of seats for those waiting to be entertained. Not only common races such as [[human]]s frequented the arena, but also [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[bugbear]]s, and potentially [[drow]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], the [[Heroes of Ascore]]-to-be came unto the arena, where they were again confronted by [[Vaalgamon]]. The [[Zhentarim]] general, who was on a podium at the western side of the arena, motioned for his followers to sit down. Once they complied, Lord Vaalgamon mocked the adventurers, but admitted that they had courage and cunning to have escaped the [[Kraken Complex]] he left them in. He promised to allow them to live if they defeated three waves of dangerous creatures.\n\nSomewhat true to his word, Vaalgamon sent three waves of creatures at the adventuring party. [[Ogre]]s, [[hell hound]]s, and [[griffon]]s charged the team, but were slain. However, the general only let them live until their next day in the arena. During their stay, the valiant [[half-orc]], [[Muthtur]], created a commotion with a jailor, whereby the heroes grabbed the keys to the cells and escaped.",
