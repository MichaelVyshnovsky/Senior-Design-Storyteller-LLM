On a busy night{{Cite adventurers league/The Map with No Names|5}} with no overnight customers in the 15{{th}} century DR, a bar brawl broke out in the Green's Rest that left a strange treasure [[map]] in its wake that was marked in glyphs. The next day, Duric Green approached a group of [[adventurer]]s to enquire if it belonged to them. Though it did not belong to them, Duric decided to give it to them anyways, offering the adventurers free drinks and a meal if they returned with an entertaining story, as well as a cut of whatever treasure they might come across.
