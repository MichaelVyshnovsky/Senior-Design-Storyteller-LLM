Greens Rest was a well-regarded inn & tavern in the city of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
The interior of Greens Rest featured a dining area with a bar and enough tables to comfortably sit thirty people. In addition to windows shining light into the room, a green driftglobe above the bar provided illumination.
This establishment was known to be rather well kept, having enough frills and rough edges to make most patrons comfortable.
Among the provendor of this establishment, it was particularly known for its bread and honey mixed with cinnamon.
This establishment was operated by the couple of Duric and Zelphin Green.
On a busy night with no overnight customers in the 15 century DR, a bar brawl broke out in the Greens Rest that left a strange treasure map in its wake that was marked in glyphs. The next day, Duric Green approached a group of adventurers to enquire if it belonged to them. Though it did not belong to them, Duric decided to give it to them anyways, offering the adventurers free drinks and a meal if they returned with an entertaining story, as well as a cut of whatever treasure they might come across.
