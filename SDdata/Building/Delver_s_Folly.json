        "Structure": "Delver's Folly was a one-story building of wood and plaster in fair condition.",
        "Description": "Delver's Folly was operated by a team of skilled engineers, all of whom were accomplished [[rogue]]s. Delver's Folly offered a wide array of [[trap]]s designed to meet diverse security needs. From concealed pits and flaming oil jets to intricate, self-rearming [[scythe]] blades, Delverâ€™s Folly provided solutions for individuals seeking reliable protection in the treacherous environment of Skullport.\n\nThe quality of their craftsmanship was exceptional, but their services did not come cheap. Unique and complex mechanisms commanded prices exceeding 5,000 [[gold pieces]].\n\nLeading the operation was [[Lystand]] the Pick, a [[human]] [[thief]] and former [[adventurer]] from [[Waterdeep]]. With her background in designing and bypassing intricate security systems, Lystand specialized in crafting traps that were as lethal as they are difficult to disarm. Her poison gas and dart traps, in particular, were infamous for their complexity."
