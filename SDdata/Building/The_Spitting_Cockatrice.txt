The Spitting Cockatrice was an inn found just outside the city of Westgate in 1367 DR.
The inn was located in between Mulsantirâ€™s Gate and the West Gate.
The Spitting Cockatrice was a fine inn favored by merchants. The food was average but the extravagant decor, excellent selection of wines, and ample security made up for this. All of these things came with a price as the inn was quite expensive.
