The Ivory Palace was a building located in Dihliz in the Cities of the Ancients in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Though slight of stature compared to other palaces, the Ivory Palaces opulence was evident in its construction since pure white limestone was used as the building material. The limestone was imported directly from Afyal.
The Ivory Palace was located in the northeast section of Dihliz.
The Ivory Palace was the home of Emira Hassana Alim al-Gaib in 1367 DR.
The palace was walled and separated from the main body of Dihliz by canals connected to the mighty Nogaro River.
