The '''Ivory Palace''' was a building located in [[Dihliz]] in the [[Cities of the Ancients]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|19}}{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Cardsheets}}

==Description==
Though slight of stature compared to other palaces, the Ivory Palace's opulence was evident in its construction since pure white limestone was used as the building material. The limestone was imported directly from [[Afyal]].

The Ivory Palace was located in the northeast section of Dihliz.

==Inhabitants==
The Ivory Palace was the home of Emira [[Hassana Alim al-Gaib]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Defenses==
The palace was walled and separated from the main body of Dihliz by canals connected to the mighty [[Nogaro River]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|12-13}}{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|5}}
