The Verdashir Academy, also known as the Dervish Academy, was a martial academy located in Baldurs Gate during the 15 century DR. It could be found in the Outer City district of Little Calimshan.
The academy offered training for Calishite warriors, in the tradition of their homeland. Outsiders were only admitted to the academy if they proved to already be exceptionally skilled in combat.
