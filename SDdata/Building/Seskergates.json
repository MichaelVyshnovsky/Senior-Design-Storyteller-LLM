        "mainbody": "'''Seskergates''' was a mansion located in [[Baldur's Gate]] that served as the family home of the [[Sesker]] mercantile clan, and later as the residence of the Baldurian court-[[mage]], [[Imbralym Skoond]].",
        "Description": "Due to the nature of work conducted by the building's first resident, Seskergates had a great number of concealed passageways, secret halls, and hidden exits.",
        "History": "The home's first resident was a smuggler within the Sesker family. It continued to serve as their home until the death of the last remaining Sesker, some time in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. In fact, that individual was killed by a [[nothic]] that dwelled in the building's subterranean passages, which were shared by the neighboring [[Mandorcai's Mansion]].\n\nSeskergates was swiftly purchased thereafter by Skoond, who retrofitted it to serve as his arcane workshop. He eventually hired a number of [[alchemist]] assistants and henchmen to map out his maze-like home.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "According to one historical text, the [[architect]] of Seskergates died while in the possession of some rare, esoteric [[book]]."
