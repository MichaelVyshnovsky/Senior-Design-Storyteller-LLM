It continued to serve as their home until the death of the last remaining Sesker, some time in the 15 century DR. In fact, that individual was killed by a nothic that dwelled in the buildings subterranean passages, which were shared by the neighboring Mandorcais Mansion.\nSeskergates was swiftly purchased thereafter by Skoond, who retrofitted it to serve as his arcane workshop. He eventually hired a number of alchemist assistants and henchmen to map out his maze-like home.\nAccording to one historical text, the architect of Seskergates died while in the possession of some rare, esoteric book."
