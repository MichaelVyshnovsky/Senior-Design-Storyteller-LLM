        "Structure": "The building resembled something of a massive vault, akin to this that could be found within the walls of a bank. Each of the building's entryways were heavily reinforced and it well-guarded by both the local constables as well as the [[Daggerford militia]].",
        "Activities": "In addition to being a meeting place for two guilds, the Jewelers' Congress served as a holding area for gems and precious metals.\n\nGuild members could store their valuables within the guildhall, for a small fee based on the inherent value of what was being safeguarded."
