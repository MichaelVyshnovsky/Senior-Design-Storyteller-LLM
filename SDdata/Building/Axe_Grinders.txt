The Axe Grinders was a bodyguard business in Skullport.
The business was located off in the Central Port district of Skullport, north of the Crossed Swords tavern and the Banes Mistress festhall.
The Axe Grinders was in poor condition.
If a customer wanted a bodyguard to take on a more dangerous assignment, most enforcers at Axe Grinders would do it for triple price. Such missions included leaving Skullport or entering the Underhalls.
Many of the inhabitants of Axe Grinders were sellswords and down-on-their-luck mercenaries. Most bodyguards wore chainmail and fought with battleaxes and longswords.
Around 1370 DR, the business was owned by Alonyius Tackpun, who hired out bodyguards to those who had coin to spend.
