The drill field was an open practice ground located in the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The drill field was located in western Daggerford south of the Caravan Quarter.
This area was used on a daily basis for training by soldiers, members of the Daggerford militia, and the constabulary. The drill field was also used to temporarily house caravans if the market was crowded.
