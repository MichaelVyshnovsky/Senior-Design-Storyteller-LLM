        "mainbody": "The '''Wyvernstones of Hullack''' were a group of [[menhir]]s at a site sacred to [[Eldath]] located in the [[Hullack Forest]] of northeastern [[Cormyr]]. Established by the [[Wyvern Circle]] in centuries past, the [[druid]]ic group had abandoned the shrine in the 1100s [[DR]] and by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the site had been taken over by the [[Bloodmoon Circle]], a sect of [[Malar]]-worshiping [[lycanthrope]]s that were part of the [[People of the Black Blood]].",
        "Location": "[[File:WyvernstonesOfHullack.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''Aerial view of the Wyvernstones.'']]\nThe Wyvernstones were hidden among the trees in the southwest quadrant of the forest, north of the eastern branch of the [[Wyvernwater]].",
        "Structure": {
            "Atmosphere": "The outer surfaces of the twelve standing stones were adorned with carvings of [[wyvern]]s and were free of lichen or moss. However, the sides facing the central pool were nearly covered by a thick layer of these plants. Beneath the obscuring plant life were ancient magical runes, some of which still contained Eldathyn [[spell]]s that could be cast if one knew how. These spells likely came from a book sacred to the druids, known as the ''[[Tome of the Wyvernwater Circle]]'', that was said to include spells such as ''[[flame shield]]'', ''[[mold touch]]'', ''[[touchsickle]]'', and ''[[wailing wind]]''. As of 1372 DR, the whereabouts of this book were unknown, but some of the menhirs were imbued with the essence of an ancient druid who could be queried via a ''[[stone tell]]'' spell. There were seven of these merged entities in the circle of twelve stones.\n\nAfter the Bloodmoon Circle was established in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the dirt around the Pool of Eldath was darkened by the blood spilled during their sacrifices. The pool also ran red after these ritual killings, but always turned clear when the dawn light touched the water. The entire area within the circle of standing stones was placed under an ''[[unhallow]]'' spell by the Malarites, giving it the effect of a ''[[magic circle against good]]'', to which they added ''[[Resist energy|fire resistance]]'' at each yearly renewal."
        },
        "Interior": "{{Main|Elfhold}}\nThe menhirs were {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} in diameter at their true base and tapered gently as they rose up through the ceiling of the grotto some {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} above the floor. Elfhold was illuminated by a single [[diamond]] that hovered about {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} above the Pool and shown with a soft brilliance that bathed the area in starlight. The gemstone was a ''[[tel'kiira]]'' attuned to the Amaratharr family.\n\nThe entire Elfhold was roughly a compressed sphere over {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} in horizontal diameter with burial crypts cut into the walls all around. Each crypt was sealed with a {{SIAdj|20|ft|adj=square}} capstone<ref group=\"note\">The map of Elfhold shows the capstones at only {{SI|10|ft}} in one dimension. This wiki's guideline is to give text descriptions precedence over images and maps. engraved with life-sized scenes of elven life that dated back before the founding of Cormyr. The twelve columns were inscribed in [[Seldruin]], using [[Hamarfae]] script, with a litany of the accomplishments of those interred. All the crypts contained the remains of members of House Amaratharr except for one. The elf-friend [[Hullack]], namesake of the surrounding forest, was a [[human]] druid that, according to the scene on his capstone and the writings on the nearby pillar, stood with elven forces against [[beholder]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and evil [[fey]].",
        "Activities": "The Wyvernstones were the center of activity and base of operations for the Bloodmoon Circle. Four times a year, on [[Midwinter]], [[Greengrass]], [[Midsummer]], and the [[Feast of the Moon]], they celebrated the [[High Hunt]] ritual by forming a circle {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}} in diameter around the site and then releasing a sentient humanoid to be hunted to the death. On [[Highharvestide]], they marched through the forest carrying the heads of anyone they caught trespassing on their territory in the previous [[tenday]]. Any meat-eating creatures that caught the scent of this grisly procession were lured to the Wyvernstones where they were allowed to feast on the remains of the interlopers, while the Malarites prevented aggression between creatures with [[magic]] and enjoyed the display of animal savagery well into the following day.",
        "Services": "The Circle did not offer any services, but did occasionally get contacted by a merchant or a noble who typically paid a [[wizard]] to use a ''[[sending]]'' spell to deliver news of activity in or around the Hullack Forest in the hopes that the Circle would attack a rival, thus alleviating any risk of blame. The Circle was amenable to such overtures as long as it did not conflict with their plans.\n\nAs of 1372 DR, any spells cast within the circle of standing stones by a druid that worshiped either Eldath or Malar were more potent, as if the caster was much more advanced than their actual status in the druid hierarchy.",
        "Defenses": "The Wyvernstones did not have any active defenses, but were protected by the members of the Bloodmoon Circle and by the priesthood of Eldath before them.",
        "History": "The Wyvernstones of Hullack were the entrance to the Elfhold, a cavern built as a tomb for the elves of House Amaratharr. The hierophant druid Hullack, a true friend of the elves, was also laid to rest with the Amaratharr family. The followers of Eldath dwindled and eventually stopped regular worship at the Wyvernstones sometime in the 12{{th}} century DR. Over two hundred years later, on the Feast of the Moon in 1363 DR, the Bloodmoon Circle was formed on the site, dedicated to Malar and claiming kinship with the People of the Black Blood.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Cormyreans in the vicinity of the Hullack Forest told tales of the Wyvernstones, but very few knew how to find them or would even think to dare approach them.",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Talgaerth Volspaan]], leader of the Bloodmoon Circle as of 1372 DR.\n* [[Djalia Amaratharr]], mate and second in command to Talgaerth.\n* [[Grolshar Twintusk]], third in command."
