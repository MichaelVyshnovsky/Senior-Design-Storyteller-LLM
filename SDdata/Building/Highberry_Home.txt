Highberry Home stood next-door to [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]], north of the [[Sorcerous Sundries]] shop in the [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]] neighborhood of Baldur's Gate.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov – Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}<ref group="note">The game's city map is representative and in no way accurate to the actual layout of Baldur's Gate. This article makes an educated guess that Highberry Home is located on the same plaza as Sorcerous Sundries, both found on the city map. Its position matches the plaza's northwestern block, which is just two buildings: the shop and the spacious Highberry family home.

==Structure==
Highberry Home was a spacious three-story building with a big open space used for festivals. Its first floor was a large [[wine]] cellar.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Highberry Home hosted a fashionable wine festival filled with guests, servers, and gossip. The hosts – [[gnome]] spouses [[Cora Highberry]] and [[Roger Highberry]], wow busy mingling with the guests, their wards – orphans [[Molly (orphan)|Molly]] and [[Timmy (orphan)|Timmy]], inside the manse, all unaware that mistress Cora was marked for death by a [[Bhaalist]] serial killer [[Dolor (Bhaalist)|Dolor]] and his special [[poison]], [[Karabasan's Gift]]. It was unrecorded if the assassination attempt on Cora Highberry was successful and if the festival was ruined by Dolor and his [[doppelganger]] murderers.
