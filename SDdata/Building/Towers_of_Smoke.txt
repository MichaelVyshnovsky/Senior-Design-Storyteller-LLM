The '''Towers of Smoke''' was a [[Raumathar]]i ruin found within the [[North Country]] of [[Rashemen]] near the [[Icerim Mountains]].

==Activities==
The Towers derived their name from the plumes of smoke that constantly leaked from their tops. The smoke was quite harmless to anyone foolish enough to approach too closely. The nearby villages gave the Towers of Smoke a wide berth.

==Defenses==
The Towers were believed to be guarded by a band of [[iron golem]]s of various shapes and sizes.
