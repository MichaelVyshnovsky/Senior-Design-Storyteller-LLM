'''The King's Ride Inn''' was a quality tavern and inn in the town of [[King's Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

===Atmosphere===
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, The King's Ride Inn was one of two inns in King's Reach. It had better quality rooms and food between the two. It catered mostly to merchants traveling [[the Vast]], who generally were uninterested in mingling with the locals or sharing drinks with adventurers.

==Services==
Unsurprisingly, The King's Ride Inn offered meals and lodgings to its guests. A room was rented at five [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] per night; food was included in the price.

==Inhabitants==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the inn was run by a single proprietor, and the staff included a waitress.
