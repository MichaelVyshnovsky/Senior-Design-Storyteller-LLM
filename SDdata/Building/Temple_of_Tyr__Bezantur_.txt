The '''Temple of Tyr''' was a small temple in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]] dedicated to the god [[Tyr]].

==Location==
Bezantur was known as the "City of a Thousand Temples", and appropriately, the Temple of Tyr was surrounded by temples to other [[deities]]. It lay southeast of the city center with the [[Temple of Bane (Bezantur)|Temple of Bane]] immediately to its north, the [[Temple of Lolth (Bezantur)|Temple of Lolth]] to its east, the temples of [[Temple of Leira (Bezantur)|Leira]] and [[Temple of Gond (Bezantur)|Gond]] to its south, and the [[Temple of Tempus (Bezantur)|Temple of Tempus]] to its west.

==Activities==
The congregation was quite small owing to the [[lawful]] Tyr being generally unpopular in Thay. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple was led by [[Mytura Shebala]] and staffed by a dozen [[cleric|warrior-priests]].
