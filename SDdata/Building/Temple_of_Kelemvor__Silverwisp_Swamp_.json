        "mainbody": "The '''temple of Kelemvor''' in the [[Silverwisp Swamp]] was a holy fortification dedicated to [[Kelemvor]] the Lord of the Dead, that came into use throughout the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The temple was situated nearby the ruined village of [[Grimhollow]] within the Silverwisp Swamp, along the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] region of [[the North]].",
        "Structure": "The wood-and-stone temple was heavily damaged, but enough of the structure remained to offer protection from the undead and vicious creatures beyond.\n\nStatues of robed, skeletal figures adorned its main entrance, flanked by banners depicting Kelemvor's [[holy symbol]]. A large brazier and several sconces illuminated by blue fire provided light amid the encroaching fog that permeated the swamp.",
        "Defenses": "Defense of the temple was minimal, lone sentries stood at the temple's perimeter monitoring for any emergent threats.",
        "History": "Some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Silverwisp swamp became overrun by undead under the command of a powerful [[Netherese]] spellcaster called [[Idris]]. After the threat of the undead became apparent, Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] directed a force of the [[Neverwinter Guard]] and [[doomguide]]s of Kelemvor led by [[Vesper Soulhearth]] to defeat Idris and her undead minions. The expedition was an abject failure. Soulhearth remained the sole survivor of the assault forces and retreated back to the temple within the swamp. Joined by a handful of others, Soulhearth did all he could to hold the undead at bay and prevent them from overwhelming the surrounding lands.\n\nSome time later, the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] reopened lines of communication with Soulhearth and his allies. Working together, the pair and their allies successfully defended the temple against an assault from the [[Barrow Lords]],{{cite web| url = https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/3037903| title = Event Preview Call to Arms: Defend the Temple| accessdate = 15/05/2022| author = DwightMC| date = 13/03/2014| publisher = ArcGames| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20220515131120/https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter/news/detail/3037903| archivedate = 15/05/2022}}<ref group=\"note\">While the game content included the assault on Kelemvor's temple was released after the original plot leading to the Barrow Lords' deaths, canonically it would have to appear beforehand. then struck out against them in their own lairs.
