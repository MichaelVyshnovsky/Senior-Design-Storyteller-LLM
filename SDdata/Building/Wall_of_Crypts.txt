The '''Wall of Crypts''' was the defensive wall of [[Surcross]] in [[Thay]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Structure==
The wall was {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} thick, at least twice as tall, and surrounded the city. It was made of heavy stone and appeared solid from the outside.

==Interior==
The wall contained hundreds of crypts located behind [[bronze]] doors bolted to the stone. Within these crypts were corpses that served as an emergency reserve force of [[zombie]]s to be deployed if the wall was ever breached. Any Thayan officer could speak the [[command word]] and cause the corpses to rise and immediately begin marching towards the greatest concentration of enemy forces.

==History==
As of [[1479 DR]], only a relatively small proportion of the Thayan [[undead]] forces in Surcross were housed within the Wall of Crypts, even as the city came under siege by the [[Netherese enclave]] [[Kolthunral]]. The remainder served as soldiers and laborers.
