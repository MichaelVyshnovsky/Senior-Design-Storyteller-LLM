        "Location": "It sat in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]] atop [[Yklwazi Hill]]. It was accessible mainly via a great stone bridge and staircase that connected it to [[Mount Sibasa]] and the rest of the Ward.",
        "Structure": "The massive arena was made of stone, with statues of famous champions lining the tops of the walls. It had a main front entrance for spectators and a rear entrance for gladiators and racers. Decorative upper chambers were used by the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] to greet and reward victorious champions.",
        "Services": "[[File:Port Nyanzaru Coliseum IC.jpeg|thumb|330px|A view of the arena floor.]]\nThe Coliseum hosted both circuses (''i.e.'', [[dinosaur]] races that circled the arena and which might include dangers and obstacles for the racers to avoid or overcome{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|16-17}}) as well as bloody [[animal]] fights (perhaps involving [[beast]]s such as [[tiger]]s and/or dinosaurs such as [[velociraptor]]s) and less bloody gladiatorial fights (the gladiators seldom fought to the death except in cases of accidents).{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|17-18}}\n\nEvents were held in the Grand Coliseum on most days, generally in the afternoon. On normal days, events were small and often included consolation fights or qualifying bouts. Major fights, championships, and other extravagant events were held on [[Calendar of Harptos|holidays]]. Some special events were presided over by one of Port Nyanzaru's merchant princes.\n\nBig shows in the arena might include themes such as \"heroes\" versus \"pirates\" or battles between [[wizard]]s and [[undead]]. Gladiatorial fights might also be made into more interesting spectacles by introducing elements such as cages or [[matabo vine]]s. Because the arena relied on sunlight for spectators to see the action, only very special events were staged at night.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the best fighters in the Grand Coliseum were regarded as celebrities in Port Nyanzaru, and one of the city's wealthy merchant princes&mdash;[[Ekene-Afa]]&mdash;was renowned for having earned her fortune through her many victories in the arena. Her exploits had cemented her as a legend among the people, and her statue stood atop the walls among those of the arena's greatest champions.\n\nDuring the events of the [[death curse]], extra precautions were taken to avoid accidental deaths of the arena's gladiators and racers, including banning the use of injurious [[magic]] and training dinosaurs not to kill. Any fighter or racer who refused to follow these new rules was immediately disqualified from participating in any events."
