        "mainbody": "he Grand Coliseum of Port Nyanzaru, Chult, was an arena that hosted races and gladiatoral games.\nIt sat in the Market Ward atop Yklwazi Hill. It was accessible mainly via a great stone bridge and staircase that connected it to Mount Sibasa and the rest of the Ward.\nThe massive arena was made of stone, with statues of famous champions lining the tops of the walls. It had a main front entrance for spectators and a rear entrance for gladiators and racers. Decorative upper chambers were used by the merchant princes to greet and reward victorious champions.\nthumb|330px|A view of the arena floor.\nThe Coliseum hosted both circuses (i.e., dinosaur races that circled the arena and which might include dangers and obstacles for the racers to avoid or overcome) as well as bloody animal fights (perhaps involving beasts such as tigers and/or dinosaurs such as velociraptors) and less bloody gladiatorial fights (the gladiators seldom fought to the death except in cases of accidents).\nEvents were held in the Grand Coliseum on most days, generally in the afternoon. On normal days, events were small and often included consolation fights or qualifying bouts. Major fights, championships, and other extravagant events were held on holidays. Some special events were presided over by one of Port Nyanzarus merchant princes.\nBig shows in the arena might include themes such as \"heroes\" versus \"pirates\" or battles between wizards and undead. Gladiatorial fights might also be made into more interesting spectacles by introducing elements such as cages or matabo vines. Because the arena relied on sunlight for spectators to see the action, only very special events were staged at night. \nAs of the late 15 century DR, the best fighters in the Grand Coliseum were regarded as celebrities in Port Nyanzaru, and one of the citys wealthy merchant princes&mdashEkene-Afa&mdashwas renowned for having earned her fortune through her many victories in the arena. Her exploits had cemented her as a legend among the people, and her statue stood atop the walls among those of the arenas greatest champions.\nDuring the events of the death curse, extra precautions were taken to avoid accidental deaths of the arenas gladiators and racers, including banning the use of injurious magic and training dinosaurs not to kill. Any fighter or racer who refused to follow these new rules was immediately disqualified from participating in any events."
