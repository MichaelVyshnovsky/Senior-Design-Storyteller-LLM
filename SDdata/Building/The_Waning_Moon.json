Thisobald and his staff collected sensitive information and rumors reporting it to Ketheric's [[Dark Justiciars]].\n\nThe local bartender [[Madeline]] had to constantly report to Dark Justiciar [[Netasha]] about the gossips and chatter in the tavern leading to the death of her best friends [[Marc Jacobs|Marc]] and [[Benjamin Blanchet|Benjamin]].According to ''[[Madeline's Ledger]]''.\n\nAs of the [[Tarsakh 10|10{{th}} Tarsakh]], Thisobald continued to collect the exposing information against the Selûnite resistance and Harpers. He focused his attention on the [[Reithwin Mason's Guild]] head mason [[Mordfred]] who got drunk and called Thisobald's father a tyrant.<ref group=\"note\">According to ''[[The Waning Moon: Consignments]]''.\n\nOn the [[Flamerule 6|6{{th}} Flamerule]] of an unknown year in the late 14{{th}} century a woman poisoned Thisobald and tried to blackmail him revealing his experiments to the Baldur's Gate's authorities. She didn't expect that the distiller was resilient to poisoning, so she got captured by him and put in a wooden [[barrel]] inside his cave laboratory.<ref group=\"note\">According to ''[[The Waning Moon: Consignments]]''.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|1492}} [[He Who Was]] was looking for an opportunity to obtain ''[[Madeline's Ledger]]'' to hold the trial of Madeline's soul.",
