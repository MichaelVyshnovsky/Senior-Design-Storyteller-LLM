        "mainbody": "'''Halambar Lutes & Harps''' was a musical instrument shop in [[Waterdeep]] in the 14th century [[DR]]. It was owned and run by [[Kriios Halambar]], who was also guildmaster of the [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers]] since ''circa'' [[1301 DR]]. It was also sometimes called '''Halambar's Lute Shop'''.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Heroes' Lorebook]]'' is the only source to name the store \"Halambar's Lute Shop\", so this is likely to be in error.",
        "Location": "The shop could be found in [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]]. It stood on the east side of the [[Street of the Sword]], some way up from [[Waterdeep Way]].",
        "Services": "As its name said, Halambar Lutes & Harps sold stringed instruments of all kinds from around [[Faerûn]], including [[Amnian]] [[lyre]]s and the [[Mintarn]] [[twostring]], but mainly [[lute]]s and [[harp]]s. They were pricy, though: regular instruments—typically small and plain and made by Halambar's apprentices or bought secondhand—cost a few hundred [[gp]], while Halambar's own didn't cost less than 1000 [[gp]].\n\nHalambar's lutes produced a distinctive mellow sound. but how they did this was his trade secret. In fact, in the cellars, he secretly soaked the wood in harbor water.\n\nThe store also sold enchanted jewel cases and snuff boxes that, when opened, played a single short tune. These cost 600 [[gp]], making them gifts for the wealthy only.\n\n[[Bard]]s and musically inclined adventurers could also register at Halambar's Lute Shop.Although ''Heroes' Lorebook'' describes Halambar's Lute Shop as \"where bards and other musically inclined adventurers register\", it is not known what they register for. With Halambar as guildmaster, this is likely to be the musician's guild, the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers.",
        "History": "Halambar Lutes & Harps was established some time before [[1357 DR]], and was certainly well known through the 1360s DR.\n\nAlthough Kriios Halambar finally died in the early 1370s DR, the store still operated by the end of [[1372 DR]].",
        "Reputation": "The shop was recognized all along the [[Sword Coast]] for the distinctive sound of its lutes, and [[Volothamp Geddarm]] noted it was worth visiting even for the non–musically talented. In particular, the Harp that Sings by Itself was a famed magical instrument in its own right.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Standing upon a velvet-draped plinth, high out of reach, was the legendary [[Harp that Sings by Itself]]. It gently played various old songs of the [[North]], but its full magical powers were forgotten. It was not for sale and protected against theft—the covered plinth was actually a [[stone golem]] guardian put there by the mage [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]].\n\nIn the 1360s DR, the [[bard]] [[Danilo Thann]] often visited Halambar's Lute Shop and worked with Halambar.\n\nA popular local story was that Halambar Lutes & Harps stood where [[Olamn]], the original bardic college of Waterdeep, stood centuries before. (This was false: it was the [[House of Song]], the musicians' guildhall, that stood on the old Olamn site.)"
