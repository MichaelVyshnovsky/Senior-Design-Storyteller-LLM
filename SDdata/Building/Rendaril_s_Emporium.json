It owed its name to its proprietor, the cunning half-elven merchant Rendaril.\nIt was located in the center of town, with its facade oriented towards the marketplace.\nThe Emporium bought all manner of goods from the folks of the Ten Towns and offered the widest variety of items for sale.\nAmong the items they offered were yew fishing rods, scrimshaw accessories, yeti-fur clothing and mithral tools and weapons made by the local dwarves.\nRendarils Emporium was converted from an old cabin that predated the town of Bryn Shander. That cabin was actually the structure around which the settlement formed."
