The '''Grand Souk''', meaning "grand market", was the largest and most impressive marketplace in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]]. It was located in the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]]. 

==Description==
The Grand Souk was a covered market that encompassed vast rows of small shops, stands, stalls, and tents.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|6}}{{Cite adventurers league/Peril at the Port|14}} Its colorful awnings kept out both the rain and [[sun]], but also served to keep in the heat and smells of the marketplace.

===Atmosphere===
The market was a sensory overload of cacophonous sounds, bright colors, and exotic odors. It was often crowded, with shoppers jostling and pressing against each other. The noise was compounded by the presence of many [[tabaxi]] [[minstrel]]s and street performers who sang, danced, and juggled for the occasional [[copper piece]].{{Cite adventurers league/In Search of Secrets|4}} The smells of [[spice]]s mixed with that of the people and their dinosaurs to become an assault on the senses.

==Services==
Just about anything could be found for purchase at the Grand Souk, and if not, some merchants would be happy to procure it for the right price. While one could easily find things like dinosaur meat, jungle [[herb]] [[medicine]]s, spices, and tropical [[fruit]]s, This included various natural treasures of the jungles&mdash;such as colorful [[feather]]s, dinosaur claws and skulls, [[iron]], [[ivory]], [[tiger]] pelts, and [[timber]]

The market opened before dawn and stayed open until dusk.

===Notable Shops===
* [[Weave of Life]], a large stand selling garments, tourism information, and kitschy handcrafts. The store's proprietor, [[Klevin Van'Sheran]], was in truth an agent for the [[Lords' Alliance]]. 
* A [[tea]] house sat just outside the market.{{Cite dragon+/16/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalu√© Part Two}}

==Defenses==
Numerous guards kept the crowds moving and patrolled the Grand Souk on the lookout for [[pickpocket]]s and urchins.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Grand Souk dwarfed the other major marketplaces in the city, notably the Jewel Market and the Red Bazaar. Merchants from all across the [[Sword Coast]] were drawn to the market to trade for exotic Chultan goods.
