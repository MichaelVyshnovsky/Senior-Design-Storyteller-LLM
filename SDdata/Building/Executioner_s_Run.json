        "mainbody": "'''Executioner's Run''' was a long pit in which the criminals of [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] were sentenced to die by being eaten alive by [[beast]]s. The spectacle of their executions also served as cheap amusement for the city's citizens.",
        "Location": "Executioner's Run was the centerpiece of Port Nyanzaru's [[Port Nyanzaru/Old City|Old City]]. The main road through the Old City split to pass along both sides of the long pit.",
        "Structure": "It was a {{SIAdj|50|foot|long=yes|adj=wide}} and {{SIAdj|200|foot|long=yes|adj=long}} rectangular trench that was about {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} deep.{{Cite adventurers league/Fester and Burn|4}} and the only way out of the pit was a series of knotted [[rope]]s at one end.",
        "Activities": "Port Nyanzaru's criminals were placed into the pit for execution, although with the tantalizing promise that they would be exonerated of their crimes if they were able to escape alive. as could offending one of the [[merchant princes (Port Nyanzaru)|merchant princes]] or [[Old_City#Government|beggar princes]].\n\nPrisoners were dropped into one end of the pit, and had to make it to the opposite end and climb the ropes to be released. However, the pit was first filled with hungry beasts, such as [[panther]]s, [[velociraptor]], or the occasional young [[allosaurus]]. The condemned had to scramble and dodge to avoid the predators, all to the cheering delight of the onlookers lining the pit. Those who escaped earned not only freedom, but the cheers and adoration of the crowd. Meanwhile, anyone who attempted to escape by other means&mdash;or was aided by someone from outside the pit&mdash;was met with boos if not hostility from both onlookers and guards.\n\nFolk of all social classes and walks of life from across Port Nyanzaru came to watch the executions, and would cram four-people deep against the walls to watch.\n\nOn occasion, one of the beasts would manage to escape the pit and cause terror among the crowd. Putting down one of these rampaging beasts was a guaranteed way to become a local hero.",
        "History": "The pit was constructed by Port Nyanzaru's [[Amn]]ian colonizers, although it was originally meant as an arena for a competitive ball game.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some criminals were known to have become celebrities after surviving multiple runs through the pit, and it was speculated that a few of them committed their crimes simply for the chance to run again.\n\nThe beggar prince [[Pock-Marked Po]] was known to throw people into Executioner's Run when they refused to answer his questions.\n\nCoinciding with the events of the [[death curse]], a [[gladiator]] named [[Taban]] refused to pay his gambling debts to an Executioner's Run bookie by the name of [[K'lahu]], prompting her to hire muscle to force him to pay. Around the same time, a man named [[Draza]] was sentenced to the Run despite his claims of innocence. His husband, [[Belym]], tried to hire [[adventurer]]s to secretly protect Draza from the sidelines."
