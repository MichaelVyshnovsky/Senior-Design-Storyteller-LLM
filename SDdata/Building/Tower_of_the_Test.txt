The Tower of the Test was a structure located on the island of Jazirat al-Gawwar in the Crowded Sea in 1367 DR.
The tower could be found in the town of Takabbar.
The tower was surrounded by a stone wall. Within the wall was a garden encircling the base of the tower that filled the air with sweet scents. The tower had four doors at its base, one on each side.
A single circular stairway wound upward from the bottom floor.
A small windowless chamber was located at the top of the stairway. An intricate pattern lined the floor of this room.
The pattern lining the floor on the towers highest level was rumored to be magical, capable of instantly transporting anyone who stood upon it to whichever location they pictured in their mind.
Four guardian genies stood before the doorways on the bottom floor of the tower, preventing anyone from ascending the stairway unless they correctly answered a question. The genies reacted aggressively to any visitor who did not immediately leave the tower if they failed to answer the question.
