The '''Council House''' was an old and unremarkable fortress-like building located in the [[Scepter District (Athkatla)|Scepter District]] of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]]. It was the base of operations for the [[Council of Six]], the government of the nation of Amn.

==History==
The building was constructed during the days of [[Shoon]] and it had extensive tunnel systems and dungeons beneath it. These led to various places within Athkatla and in the surrounding countryside.
