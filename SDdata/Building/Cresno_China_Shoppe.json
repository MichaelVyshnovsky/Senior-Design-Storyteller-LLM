        "History": "In [[Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}{{LCRB}}, the street in front of Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern erupted in violence. [[Church of Cyric|Clergy]] of [[Cyric]], the Mad God, clashed in a vicious battle with [[Church of Bane|priests]] of [[Bane]]. To make matters worse, Banites were joined by devotees of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] halfway through. The battle resumed with numerous civilian casualties and massive property damage for both Cresno China Shoppe and the Sleepy Dwarf. Only one competent was found still alive by the Ravens Bluff's guardsmen. One notable injured individual was [[Meegan]], an employee of the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern. The incident was reported by [[Silva Sinderan]] in that month's ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' [[broadsheet]]."
