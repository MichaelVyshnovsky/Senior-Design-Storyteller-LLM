The '''Magelings' Manor''' was the nicknamed given to a particular boarding house that operated in the great city of [[Myth Drannor]].

==Location==
The rowhouse was located at the intersection between [[Scatterhorn Street]] and [[Moonshadows Street]], in the [[Myth Drannor/Kerradunath|Kerradunath]] district of the city.

==Services==
The Magelings' Manor offered private rooms for those students of the [[Irithlium]] that chose not to live on-campus, often of a desire for more privacy. In addition to extra space to hone their craft, the young spellcasters also received a tastier variety of food, prepared by a [[Calishite]] cook named [[Usaagar]].
