The '''Many-Windowed Tower''' was a slender tower, 6 or 7 stories tall, on the southwestern shores of the [[Yal Tengri]] in the [[Hordelands]].

==Inhabitants==
The tower was the abode of a [[lich]] named [[Demchungchumrub]] who kidnapped and killed sailors along Yal Tengri to crew his [[spelljammer]] ship, a great [[galley]] known as ''[[Delras]]''.
