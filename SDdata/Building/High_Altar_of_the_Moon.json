        "mainbody": "The '''High Altar of the Moon''', or the '''\"Moontower\"''' as the lay people of the city called it, was a temple to [[Selûne]] in the city of [[Iriaebor]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "Just east of the [[High Tower of Iriaebor]] stood the round Moontower, a silver-and-black structure.",
        "Interior": "Against one wall was a series of prayer-boxes built of teak wood. Worshipers would kneel inside these to make private prayers. Each box had a grate in the roof so that light could pour in. In the thirteenth box, by knocking a secret code on the wooden panel (three knocks, a pause, and two more knocks), it would be opened by a member of the [[Purple Masks Guild]], and if recognized they would lead the individual(s) to the Purple Masks' hideout.",
        "Inhabitants": "High Moonmaiden [[Astyaril Hulemene]] led faithful in eerie moonlit rituals. A friend to Harpers, Astyaril added the only touch of romance and mystery to the lives of most Iriaebens. For that reason alone, services here are always attended. There are 36 priests and 51 followers."
