        "mainbody": "'''Barthen's Provisions''' was [[Phandalin]]'s largest trading house in the early 1490s DR.{{Phandelver-time}}",
        "Location": "The store was located on the north side of Phandalin, and to the west of owner [[Elmar Barthen]]'s house. It was the first shop that would be seen when entering Phandalin from the [[Triboar Trail]].",
        "Services": "Barthen's Provisions acted as a general store, and was open from dawn until dusk. However, they did not sell [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] or [[potion]]s, but Barthen would helpfully direct interested buyers to places where they could find these. For larger orders, Barthen would supply a cart pulled by his [[ox]] [[Vincent (ox)|Vincent]] to move the goods.\n\nBarthen's Provisions also served as a trading hub. Clerks [[Ander (Phandalin)|Ander]] and [[Thistle (clerk)|Thistle]] would unload and load carts of goods and resources that came into, or were to go out of, Phandalin via wagon.",
        "History": "In [[1491 DR]], [[Gundren Rockseeker]], a [[dwarf]] explorer, struck a deal to transfer a wagon full of goods from [[Neverwinter]] to Barthen's store. He hired a group of novice [[adventurer]]s to transport the goods, however he himself was waylaid by [[goblin]] bandits and never made it to the trading post.\n\nDuring this time, Barthen's Provisions also struck deals to sell dry goods and supplies to [[Tibor Wester's loggers' camp|logging operations]] run by [[Tibor Wester]], the half-brother of Townmaster [[Harbin Wester]], as well as deals to sell herds of [[giant goat]]s on behalf of [[Dagult Neverember]] in order to fund rebuilding efforts in [[Leilon]].\n\nThe company went out of business in late [[1495 DR]] or early [[1496 DR]]. About five months later, the building was purchased by an unknown person who donated it to the worship of [[Waukeen]], and it was quickly renovated into the [[Temple of the Coinmaiden]] by [[Ditch Fundi]].{{AI-time}}"
