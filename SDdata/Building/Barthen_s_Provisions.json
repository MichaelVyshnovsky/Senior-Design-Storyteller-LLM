        "mainbody": "arthens Provisions was Phandalins largest trading house in the early 1490s DR.\nThe store was located on the north side of Phandalin, and to the west of owner Elmar Barthens house. It was the first shop that would be seen when entering Phandalin from the Triboar Trail.\nBarthens Provisions acted as a general store, and was open from dawn until dusk. However, they did not sell weapons and armor or potions, but Barthen would helpfully direct interested buyers to places where they could find these. For larger orders, Barthen would supply a cart pulled by his ox Vincent to move the goods.\nBarthens Provisions also served as a trading hub. Clerks Ander and Thistle would unload and load carts of goods and resources that came into, or were to go out of, Phandalin via wagon.\nIn 1491 DR, Gundren Rockseeker, a dwarf explorer, struck a deal to transfer a wagon full of goods from Neverwinter to Barthens store. He hired a group of novice adventurers to transport the goods, however he himself was waylaid by goblin bandits and never made it to the trading post.\nDuring this time, Barthens Provisions also struck deals to sell dry goods and supplies to logging operations run by Tibor Wester, the half-brother of Townmaster Harbin Wester, as well as deals to sell herds of giant goats on behalf of Dagult Neverember in order to fund rebuilding efforts in Leilon.\nThe company went out of business in late 1495 DR or early 1496 DR. About five months later, the building was purchased by an unknown person who donated it to the worship of Waukeen, and it was quickly renovated into the Temple of the Coinmaiden by Ditch Fundi."
