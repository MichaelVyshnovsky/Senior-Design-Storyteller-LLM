        "mainbody": "'''Delfen's Tower''' was the home of the skilled [[wizard]] [[Delfen Ondabarl]] who inhabited the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas}}",
        "Location": "Delfen's Tower was actually incorporated into the surrounding wall that encapsulated Daggerford. The tower stood along the midway point of Daggerford's northern wall near the [[Farmer's Gate]]. The tower was located along [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]].",
        "Description": "The outward facing arrow slits on the tower's walls were smaller that usual given that Delfen only needed to see a target to cast a [[spell]] at them. The inward facing walls of the tower had larger windows so that he could enjoy a view of the city.\n\nDelfen's Tower was three stories tall. He used the top level as his personal quarters. The second level served as a classroom and dormitory for his students. The ground level was used to stable his mule and general supplies.",
        "History": "Delfen moved to Daggerford when the north wall was under construction. In exchange for a generous donation, Delfen was able to acquire one of the defensive towers to use as his personal home."
