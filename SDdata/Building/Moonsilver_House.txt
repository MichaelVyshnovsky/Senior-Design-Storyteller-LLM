'''Moonsilver House''' was a temple of [[Selûne]] in the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]].

==Location==
The temple lay in the south-western part of the city, not far from the docks.

==Inhabitants==
By [[1358 DR]], the temple was managed by High Priestess [[Wyndra Syrylstone]], who held the title "Moon Mistress". She led twenty-two priestesses, as well as 229 lay worshipers. This was the case through [[1367 DR]] and [[1370 DR]].

==Description==
Moonsilver House was one of two temples that dominated daily Calauntan life, at least for those of a more kindly nature.
