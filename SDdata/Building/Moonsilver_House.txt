Moonsilver House was a temple of Selûne in the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the mid–14th century DR.
The temple lay in the south-western part of the city, not far from the docks.
By 1358 DR, the temple was managed by High Priestess Wyndra Syrylstone, who held the title "Moon Mistress". She led twenty-two priestesses, as well as 229 lay worshipers. This was the case through 1367 DR and 1370 DR.
Moonsilver House was one of two temples that dominated daily Calauntan life, at least for those of a more kindly nature.
