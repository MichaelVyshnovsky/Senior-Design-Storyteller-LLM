        "mainbody": "The '''Sword Coast Traders' Bank''' was a banking business in [[Daggerford]] that offered money-lending and secured storage to the merchants and traders that came through town. It was owned by [[Belinda Anteos|Lady Belinda]] of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] [[Anteos]] family of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Location": "It was located on the southern side of the [[Money Quarter]] on Horse Way.",
        "Structure": "The bank was established within a well-secured building.",
        "Services": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the bank offered a fairly straightforward service. Individuals could deposit their hard-earned [[coin]] within the secured building and withdraw the same amount in one of the nearby metropolises of [[Baldur's Gate]] or [[Waterdeep]]. Information about the amounts of transactions and the bank's clientele were kept secret and only sent to the other cities by [[magic]]ally safeguarded means.\n\nThe Sword Coast Traders' Bank sought to offer loans to Daggerford's citizens, using the wealth they kept secured away within the bank. This aspect of the business was less successful however, as the people of the town preferred to work with their local acquaintances.",
        "History": "The establishment of this business was heartily endorsed by the town's leader [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn Daggerford]]."
