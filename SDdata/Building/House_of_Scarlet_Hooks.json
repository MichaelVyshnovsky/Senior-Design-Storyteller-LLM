        "mainbody": "he House of Scarlet Hooks was a temple of Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain, in the city of Calaunt in the Vast in the mid–14th century DR.\nBy 1358 DR and through to 1370 DR and later, the temple was managed by Whipmistress Shaleen \"Talonkiss\" Oomreen. She led twenty-four priests and priestesses, as well as 114 lay worshipers. Among the priests were two Pains. All were particularly eager to spread the so-called \"holy pain\".\nThe House of Scarlet Hooks was one of two temples that dominated daily Calauntan life. It was an impressive building. The double-spired House of Scarlet Hooks was one of the few notable landmarks in the city, as were the muffled screams.\nCategoryTemples\nCategoryTemples to Loviatar\nCategoryLoviatan locations\nCategoryLocations in Calaunt\nCategoryLocations in the Vast\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n62yp5ww4co1u3f9ri2f2b9yskkuqal7"
