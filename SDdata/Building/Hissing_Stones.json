        "mainbody": "The '''Hissing Stones''' bathhouse was an amenity and local landmark of [[Baldur's Gate]], being one of the oldest buildings in the city as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The establishment had a sterling reputation as the city's safest and most confidential meeting area among the various Baldurian power groups.\n\nIt was owned and operated by [[Merilyn Allaryr]], a [[moon elf]] with enough experience and acumen to effectively manage the various personalities and political groups that patronized her establishment. She paid her staff well enough that they were largely insusceptible to bribery.",
