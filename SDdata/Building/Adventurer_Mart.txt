The '''Adventurer Mart''' was a shop found within [[Waukeen's Promenade]] in the [[Center District (Athkatla)|Center District]] of [[Athkatla]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Although they were typically looked down upon in most parts of the city, this shop catered to [[adventurer]]s, selling [[magic]]al items, [[weapon]]s, [[armor]] and spellcasting supplies. In defiance of the [[Cowled Wizards]], the Adventurer Mart also had a merchant that sold magical [[scroll]]s.

==Location==
The store was located in the western part of Waukeen's Promenade. It was the closest store to the location where [[Abdel Adrian]] escaped from the [[dungeon]] of [[Jon Irenicus]].

==Structure==
The outer structure of the store was a essentially a large block of stone with a single wooden door. It was surrounded by two stone staircases, which lead up to the other stores in the western part of the promenade.

==Interior==
The Adventurer Mart was divide into two floors: the entry floor and the top floor. The entry floor was patrolled by a guard, and contained the desk of the owner, [[Ribald Barterman]]. This floor displayed several booths of [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, and [[tool]]s (such as [[shovel]]s and [[pickaxe]]s). There was also a giant musical [[harp]] and several filled bookcases.

The upper floor hosted the merchants, as well as the store owner's [[wyvern]] named [[Lucy]]. The upper room contained many bookshelves, displayed scrolls, as well as potions on show. [[Deidre]] and [[Yuth|Lady Yuth]] sold their goods on this floor.

The store also had a couple of [[painting]]s illustrating adventurers who died fighting the notorious dragon [[Tiamat]]. The paintings depicted the faces of the leading adventurer, [[Hank|Hank the Ranger]], as well as the presumably-swallowed [[Bobby|Bobby the Barbarian]].These paintings referred to characters of the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons (TV series)|Dungeons & Dragons TV series]]'', who were attempting to return to their homeland. Characters of this television series featured in the ''[[The Grand Tour]]'' comic by [[Jeff Grubb]], where the mage of the group tried to become [[Elminster]]'s apprentice.

===Atmosphere===
It was frequented by adventurers, commoners and noblemen alike.

==Services==

Ribald sold a variety of goods, including weapons, armor, trinkets and scrolls. Lady Yuth sold a huge variety of magical scrolls, whereas Deidre had some unique and incredibly powerful items for sale, from companions of the [[Nameless One]]<ref group="note">Deidre appeared to have items for sale that originated from [[Sigil]], with the items themed around characters from ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. and [[Balduran]].

Apparently, the store had catalogues and "an army of scribes" to keep up with the large demand of items sold there.

==Defenses==
An Amnian soldier kept watched and enforced the law, such as not allowing loitering near the shopkeep, around the building. The goods were under his protection, and he allowed no opportunity for thievery.

==History==
The Adventurer Mart had been in business for thirty years in [[1368 DR]], in the same location.

==Inhabitants==
As well as the staff, a couple of men seemed to stay in the store.
* [[Brelm]], a [[dwarven]] drunkard who had befriended the owner.
* [[Gereth]], a robed nobleman who spent a long time searching the large store for a certain rarity.
