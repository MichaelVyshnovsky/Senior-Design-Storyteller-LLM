        "mainbody": "One-Armed Magurks was a shop in the town of Thunderstone in Cormyr in the late 1360s DR run by Magurk.\nMagurk purchased—no questions asked—goods looted by adventurers from ruins and dungeons found within the untamed wildernesses around Thunderstone the Hullack Forest, the Thunder Peaks, and the Vast Swamp. He sold it on in his store, and thus his selection varied greatly over time, but generally included a varied collection of artworks, gems, and jewelry weapons and armor books and used equipment.\nAs Magurk was a former soldier of the Purple Dragons, the local contingent kept a close watch on the store."
