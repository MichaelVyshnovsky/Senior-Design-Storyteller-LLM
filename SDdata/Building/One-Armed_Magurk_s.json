        "Activities": "Magurk purchased—no questions asked—goods looted by adventurers from ruins and [[dungeon]]s found within the untamed wildernesses around Thunderstone: the [[Hullack Forest]], the [[Thunder Peaks]], and the [[Vast Swamp]]. He sold it on in his store, and thus his selection varied greatly over time, but generally included a varied collection of artworks, gems, and jewelry; weapons and armor; books; and used equipment.\n\nAs Magurk was a former soldier of the [[Purple Dragons]], the local contingent kept a close watch on the store."
