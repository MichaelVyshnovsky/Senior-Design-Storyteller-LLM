'''Castle Maalthiir''', also known as '''Vultureroost''', was an imposing structure overlooking the city of [[Hillsfar]].

==Location==
The castle sat on the high ground in the very center of the city.

==Description==
A vast network of catacombs honeycombed the area beneath the castle. [[Maalthiir]] used these chambers to host lavish parties where less acceptable forms of entertainment were offered.

==Inhabitants==
In addition to Maalthiir, the castle housed 32 of his elite guards as well as any honored guests or associates.

==Defenses==
The castle was accessible by a single gate that was well-guarded, making the structure practically impregnable. Maalthiir could call upon an additional force of a thousand [[Red Plumes]] housed in an adjacent barracks.
