        "Location": "This temple could be found in the [[Pilgrims' District]] of the City of Delights.",
        "Structure": "As with most mosques in Huzuz, the Mosque of Kor had two floors above ground and a basement below ground. The second floor was topped with a grand dome.\n\nThe ground floor served as the main area of worship. Displays from the dancing [[dervish]]es were common here. Seats were present for other worshipers, but all true believers of [[Kor]] joined in the dance. A huge tapestry hung from the wall showing Kor bestowing wisdom upon the other [[Zakharan pantheon|Zakharan gods]].\n\nAll of the clerical brethren of the mosque were quartered in the basement. Laymen lived outside of the mosque.\n\nThe second floor was open to the dome, providing an excellent view of an enchanted chandelier that hung from the top of dome. The chandelier was capable of playing music on command, though only the high priests were taught how to command the chandelier. Additionally, the chandelier would chime if an unenlightened individual entered the mosque.",
        "Inhabitants": "High Priest Imam [[Gogal]] was the head of the mosque. He supervised over 200 lesser ranking priests of Kor and laymen.",
        "Activities": "Since Kor was the god of wisdom, age was venerated within his mosque as their teachings dictated that one should always seek counsel from an elder."
