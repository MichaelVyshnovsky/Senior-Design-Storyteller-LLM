Arch Hold was a stronghold in Archendale that was a part of White Fords defensive system.
Arch Hold was named for its strategic position, overseeing the dark and perilous Arch Wood.
It stood close to the western edge of Arch Wood and bordered White Fords Wolfwall.
Arch Hold comprised a ring-shaped stone wall with a protective ditch. It had a dug-out sleeping quarters for the members of the one or two  Rides (sixty members each) garrisoned in White Ford and the Archenriders patrolling Archendale.
Its elevated location afforded a commanding view of the whole Wolfwall encircling White Ford and linking Arch Hold with the other local stronghold, Beacon Tor.
Around 1370 DR, the stronghold possessed some ballista emplacements scattered along its walls. Arch Holds arsenal had giant crossbow used by the garrison to target the edge of Arch Wood. The bolts were often treated with pitch and ignited to be used as fire arrows.
