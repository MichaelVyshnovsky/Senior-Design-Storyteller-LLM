'''Arch Hold''' was a stronghold in [[Archendale]] that was a part of [[White Ford]]'s defensive system.

==Name==
Arch Hold was named for its strategic position, overseeing the dark and perilous [[Arch Wood]].

==Location==
It stood close to the western edge of Arch Wood and bordered White Ford's [[Wolfwall]].

==Structure==
Arch Hold comprised a ring-shaped stone wall with a protective ditch. It had a dug-out sleeping quarters for the members of the one or two  [[Archenriders#Organization|Rides]] (sixty members each) garrisoned in White Ford and the Archenriders patrolling [[Archendale]].

Its elevated location afforded a commanding view of the whole Wolfwall encircling White Ford and linking Arch Hold with the other local stronghold, [[Beacon Tor]].

==Defenses==
Around [[1370 DR]], the stronghold possessed some [[ballista]] emplacements scattered along its walls. Arch Hold's arsenal had giant [[crossbow]] used by the garrison to target the edge of Arch Wood. The [[bolt]]s were often treated with [[pitch]] and ignited to be used as [[fire arrows]].
