        "mainbody": "'''Sangora Sanguinaries''' was a merchant stall at the [[Corpse Market]] in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]]. Its proprietor was the [[vampire]] [[Sangora]].",
        "Services": "The stall predominately sold cups of warm blood to vampire clientele. However, Sangora was a very well-informed resident of Evernight and so also sold \"ephemeral\" things like information and directions. She answered questions for 20 [[gp]] each, making her knowledge the more profitable side of her business."
