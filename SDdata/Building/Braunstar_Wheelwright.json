        "mainbody": "'''Braunstar Wheelwright''' was a [[wagon]] and [[carriage]] shop in [[Ashabenford]] in the late 1300's [[DR]]. It was run by the expert wainwright [[Elmo Braunstar]], a wise and beloved man within [[Mistledale]], who designed, sold and repaired wagons and carriages of all kinds.{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}}",
        "Services": "The shop offered extremely reasonable prices, so much so that traveling merchants passing through would often purchase a pair of wheels to ensure an even axle in case of a wheel break. As a result the shop was often low on wheels for sale.",
        "Products": "The shop featured a number of carriages and wagons of Braunstar's design, including the [[Swanswing (carriage)|Swanswing covered carriage]], which was very popular among nobles, and the [[Fleetrun (wagon)|Fleetrun long wagon]], which were a prideful means of conveyance for the merchants of the [[Dragon Reach]]. The latter were so popular they had a three-year-long back order, to the point where they were the target of thieves even when traveling empty."
