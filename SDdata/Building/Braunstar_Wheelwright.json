        "mainbody": "Braunstar Wheelwright was a wagon and carriage shop in Ashabenford in the late 1300s DR. It was run by the expert wainwright Elmo Braunstar, a wise and beloved man within Mistledale, who designed, sold and repaired wagons and carriages of all kinds.\nThe shop offered extremely reasonable prices, so much so that traveling merchants passing through would often purchase a pair of wheels to ensure an even axle in case of a wheel break. As a result the shop was often low on wheels for sale.\nThe shop featured a number of carriages and wagons of Braunstars design, including the Swanswing covered carriage, which was very popular among nobles, and the Fleetrun long wagon, which were a prideful means of conveyance for the merchants of the Dragon Reach. The latter were so popular they had a three-year-long back order, to the point where they were the target of thieves even when traveling empty."
