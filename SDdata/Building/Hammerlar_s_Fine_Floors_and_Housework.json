        "mainbody": "'''Hammerlar's Fine Floors and Housework''' was the woodshop of [[Olen Hammerlar]], the highly skilled house carpenter found within the city of [[Sundabar]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. \n\nHe would work throughout the [[Sundabar Vale]], taking his [[wagon]]-drawn, [[horse]]-driven sawmill anywhere within a six-day ride from the city.\n\nHammerlar prided himself on fast, efficient work in and around the city of Sundabar. Unless ordered during the winter months, Olen swore he only needed a single day to build the porch of a house, or a [[tenday]] for a palisade or entire cabin."
