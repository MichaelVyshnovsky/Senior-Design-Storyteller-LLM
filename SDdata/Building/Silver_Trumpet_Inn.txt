The Silver Trumpet Inn was an inn located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The Silver Trumpet Inn was located in Zhentil Keeps Common Quarter in the northwest section of the city. It was found along Wizards Way where Warrior Street terminated at the wall separating the Inner Quarter from the rest of the city.
The building resembled a castle more than an inn with its five towers and large size. The elongated side of the Silver Trumpet Inn stretched for an impressive .
The Silver Trumpet Inn had thirty separate rooms to rent for guests.
Not only was the Silver Trumpet Inn by far the highest quality inn found in the Common Quarter, it rivaled most of the inns found in "nicer" sections of the city as well. The quality of the inn was reflected in its prices, which far exceeded those of the other inns in this part of the city.
Nightly entertainment, usually in the form of performances by travelling bards or singers, was a staple of the inn.
Unbeknownst to most, the inn was owned by Manshoon of the Zhentarim, though he used an intermediary to handle the daily operations of the building. Manshoon would visit the Silver Trumpet Inn sometimes to listen to the whispers of the commoners.
