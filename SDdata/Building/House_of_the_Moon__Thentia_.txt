The '''House of the Moon''' was a large temple of [[Selûne]] in [[Thentia]].

==Location==
The temple was located towards the inland, northern side of Thentia, on a main road running towards the coast.

==Structure==
The temple was built from white marble and alabaster with silver trim. The domed, vaulted ceiling of the sanctuary was a painted midnight blue field with dramatic depictions of the lunar phases.

==History==
In [[1194 DR]], the temple performed an inquest into the deaths of three priestesses in [[Glister]] who were suspected of being part of the [[New Moon Pact|New Moon Heresy]]. The sisters [[Fela Thesk|Fela]], [[Iwna Thesk|Iwna]], and [[Mirela Thesk]] were cleared of all suspicions and declared innocent.

In [[1345 DR]] it became the sole major temple in Thentia when the [[Zhentarim]] blew up the temple of [[Waukeen]] during a heist.

Around [[1376 DR]], the temple experienced a surge in popularity as witnesses claimed to see [[Selûne]] gliding above the waves of the sea, and sailors who defended her name in brawls received a glowing boon on their weapons.

==Inhabitants==
In 1376 DR the temple was overseen by [[Sureene Aumratha]] and 34 lesser priests and priestesses. She was also assisted by two sorcerous sisters, [[Jannatha Goldenshield]] and [[Baerimel Dunnath]], who performed investigations for Sureene.
