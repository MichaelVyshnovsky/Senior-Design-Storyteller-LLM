        "mainbody": "'''The Dawn of Any Day''' was an instrument shop in [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], which also carried other goods that had minor [[Item enchantment|enchantments]] placed upon them. The shop had a distinctive sigil: the rays of the sun rising over a [[harp]] standing atop a [[lute]].",
        "Description": "The Dawn of Any Day was a small, dim building with simple wooden doors leading inside, which were only decorated by the store's sigil.\n\nThe wares inside were often in used or damaged conditions and were kept safe within floating orbs of glowing air, which could only be consistently opened by the shop's proprietor, [[Darthleene]]. Customers who tried to grab the orbs themselves would find them passing through their bodies harmlessly, item and all.",
        "Location": "The store was in Berdusk, nestled between the homes of wealthy merchants and the temples to [[Milil]], [[Oghma]], and [[Helm]]. It fronted many different streets in the city, including [[Lute Street]], the [[Minstrelride]], [[Danathar's Street]], and [[Amble Lane]]. The shop appeared to be open at all times.\n\nWards placed upon the shop allowed its many entrances to change, appearing as though they led into small private domiciles rather than the shop itself as protection against thieves.",
        "Services": "The shop specialized in the sale of musical instruments but also carried a number of items bearing minor enchantments. There was a persistent rumor around Berdusk that these magical items had spells imbued into them that allowed the [[Harpers]] to track the items' locations.\n\nAside from instruments, [[healing potion]]s, and items with glow-on-command enchantments, the store's stock changed constantly. The rarer items that passed through the store were often found to be more costly, as well as to have all manner of curses, conditions, or spells upon them."
