        "mainbody": "The '''Lathander Shrine''', also called the '''Shrine of Lathander''', was a temple to [[Lathander]] located in the town of [[Leilon]].",
        "Location": "The Shrine was located on the southern side of town overlooking the [[Barge Yard]].",
        "Services": "Worshipers of Lathander were welcome to come inside and pray at a small stone altar. The Shrine held services each morning at dawn.\n\nCurative [[magical]] services were available in exchange for donations. When the Shrine was rebuilt in the late 15{{th}} century DR, head priest [[Merrygold Brightshine]] provided ''[[cure wounds]]'' in thanks for donations of 10 [[gold pieces]] and ''[[lesser restoration]]'' for 20 gold pieces. For free, Merrygold was glad to provide advice to any who prayed at the Shrine's altar.",
        "History": "The Shrine that stood in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] was not the original as another Shrine to Lathander had been one of Leilon's first major temples prior to Leilon's destruction.\n\nWhen Leilon was rebuilt by [[Dagult Neverember]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[church of Lathander]] paid for the honor of having their ruined Shrine be the first temple to be rebuilt. Merrygold assisted in the refounding of the town on the church's behalf, and the staff of the Shrine used their spare time to care for and feed the workers rebuilding the town.\n\nDuring its reconstruction, the Shrine welcomed any faithful of Lathander who wished to help make the new temple bigger or better.\n\nWhen [[Jack Torver]] arrived to open the new town's first general store, he would attend each morning's service and share the wisdom from Merrygold's sermons with his customers.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Sleeping Dragon's Wake}}"
