'''Aladiam's Imports''' was a shop in [[Tegal's Mark]] that sold [[spices]] and [[silk]]s imported from [[Sembia]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The establishment was run by a retired [[Calishite]] adventurer named [[Aladiam]]. He was a known smuggler and fence

The shop was defended by some sort of invisible guardian. On one occasion it ripped through three Sembians who confronted Aladiam about some stolen goods.
