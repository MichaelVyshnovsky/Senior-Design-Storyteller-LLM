'''The Golden Lodge''' was a small shrine dedicated to the Merchant's Friend, the goddess [[Waukeen]], located in [[Lonelywood]], one of the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]].

{{quote|''Welcome, travelers, to the Golden Lodge, shrine to Waukeen. I am Grand Syndar Quinn Silverfinger... but my friends just call me Quinn. What can I do for you on this fine, chilly day?''|Grand Syndar Quinn Silverfinger}}

==Location==
The Golden Lodge stood close to the center of the settlement, just east of a well and south of the [[Weeping Willow Inn]].

==Structure==
The shrine was a simple wooden structure that consisted of two square sections connected by an elongated hallway. Like many other buildings in Lonelywood, The Golden Lodge was built on stilts, elevated over the frozen soil with a single stair leading toward its entrance.

==Interior==

The temple opened up into a small square chamber, lavishly decorated by Lonelywood's standards. The entrance was followed by a carpeted walkway across a tiny pool with statues of Waukeen on each side, depicting the goddess as a beautiful young woman with an outstretched arm. A decorative railing encircled the pool, and the chamber's floors and walls were tiled. The shrine's altar stood in the northern corner of the room. To its right was a long passageway with a red and black rug along its length that led to the priest's quarters hidden behind a curtain.

The cleric's quarters was a square room of the same size as the shrine with wooded floors and a single rug near the fireplace. Its walls held bookshelves stuffed to the brim with [[book]]s on the topic of trade and commerce, and the room's furnishing consisted of a desk, comfy chair, and a large bed.

==Services==
The shrine offered the usual array of [[cleric]]al services: healing, priestly spells and rituals, as well as some mercantile activities. The temple dealt with potions and some [[enchanted]] items available in exchange for a generous donation. [[Tymoran]] magic ''[[oil of second chances]]'' was one of the temple's most notable consumables. Magic items available there included ''[[Waukeen's Defender]]'' [[shield]], the ''[[kinetic spear]]'' created by [[Giddeon the Believer]], an [[Ilmatari]] ''[[Three White Doves]]'' [[mace]], the ''[[Flail of Mae]]'', ancient ''[[Amaunator's Legacy]]'', the nihilistic weapon called the ''[[Inconsequence]]'', exotic ''[[Sarutobi's Stone Breakers]]'' from [[Shou Lung]], and [[Mulhorandi]] ''[[scarab of goodwill]]''.

In addition to the priestly and mercantile activities, The Golden Lodge performed tasks common for the clergy of Waukeen â€“ it maintained relations with the crafters and artisans of Lonelywood, monitored trade, and aided upstart businesses and exporters.

==History==
The temple was established by Grand Syndar [[Quinn Silverfinger]] of [[Goldspires]] in [[Athkatla]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1281}}. Another notable member of the clergy who served under Quinn was [[Nolan the Healer]] who served the church at The Golden Lodge until he was shipped to [[Targos]] as a "penance" for greed running too thickly in Nolan's blood. He was tasked with establishing new trade with Lonelywood and traveled to other settlements in the area, trying to convert drunks and [[barbarian]]s into the Waukenaar faith. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Nolan of The Golden Lodge joined the [[Targos Guard]] as a healer to aid the town against the attacks of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that plagued the region.
