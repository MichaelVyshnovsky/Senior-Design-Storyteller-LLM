Baldurs Gate, Sword Coast
Scarbradros Haven was an inn catering to caravan crews in Baldurs Gate in the 14 century DR.
The Haven was situated within the city walls, almost directly next to its southernmost gate.
Old and drafty, the Haven resembled an oversized, unadorned stone barn stretching four stories tall.
The Havens furniture was uniformly massive and made from wood, utterly functional to its core with no thought spared for ornamentation or interior design. No paintings or rugs were used for decor, nor were any of the walls painted. The kitchen was open and dining guests were seated at trestle tables with bench seating attached.
In keeping with its exterior, the Havens guest rooms were functional yet spartan. Guests were provided with metal chamberpots and woollen blankets.
The inn seemed to always be filled with guests, with many stopping by just to eat a cheap meal.
The Haven served warm meals, usually consisting of stews, dark nutbread and their own ale. Hot broth was served in the winter and on cold days.
In addition to serving as an inn, Scarbradros Haven provided wagon crews with stables, storage for their coaches, and a warehouse.
The owner and operator of the inn, Horlo Scarbradro, was a scarred, burly man who had retired from his career as a caravan master. He was well loved by his patrons, who referred to him as "Our Scar". The staff was known for their skill in the art of violence. Additionally, Horlo employed a number of younger errand-boys who also served as his spies.
