Auroras Emporium was a chain of curio shops located throughout Faerûn. The shops sold exotic items sourced from all over world.
Aurora was a former adventurer who travelled the Realms. After retirement she sought a way to stave off boredom, so she founded the first shop in Waterdeep. Demand grew and she began to open shops across Faerûn with the help of her fellow retired adventurer, Jhegaan the Maestro, and a wizard/accountant, Thane of Westgate.
A deposit for an order was placed at one of the many locations that were connected through a network of teleportation spells and devices. A central warehouse was maintained that was moved in its entirety once per year. If an item was in stock, it would arrive in two to three days, although same-day delivery was often available for an extra fee.  Items were grouped together, reduced via magical spells, and sent all at once. The remainder of any payments were due upon pick-up at the outlet store. Items found unsatisfactory by the customer or that remained at the outlet for more than two tendays were returned to the central warehouse.
The businesss mission statement was based on three pillars
1) Acquire quality items at a good price
2) Sell said items at a good profit to customers
3) Maintain the good name of Auroras Emporiumthumb|right|Aurora, Jhegaan, and Thane.
