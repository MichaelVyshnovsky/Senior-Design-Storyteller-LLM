        "mainbody": "Heldartowers was an urban mansion and home of the noble Cormyrean Barelder family in Suzail.\nHeldartowers sat in the city block east of the Horngate and north of the Promenade in Suzail, in the northwestern corner of the city.\nThe house was tall with no grounds or garden, and was made of dark stone with a tile roof and leaded glass windows.\nHeldartowers was originally the home of the non-noble Vaerendur Heldar, who eventually sold it to the Barelder family in the late 15 century and moved to Marsember. The Barelders kept the name unchanged.\nThe place was the primary residence of the Barelder family, rather than their rural estate of Windcrag House on the Tun Shores. Lady Narnathra Barelder and her husband Varkander Heldruth lived there with their daughters Maereenra and Braeryl, keeping a quiet household together."
