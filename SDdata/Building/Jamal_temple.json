        "mainbody": "The '''Jamal temple''' was a small temple of [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightenment]] found at the [[Jamal Oasis]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}",
        "Description": "This cylindrical temple was made from [[granite]] that had been polished smooth by sand over time. The temple was crowned with dozens of minarets carved with enlightened proverbs. Though many of these etchings were unreadable from the passage of time, one at the base of the temple read: \"How can any man born of earth claim to divine the true purposes of the gods?\"",
        "Rumors & Legends": "[[Djinn]] were rumored to visit the Jamal temple periodically on the darkest nights to debate the carved words. Any [[human]]s presenting [[apple]]s to the djinn, a favorite treat of theirs, were allowed to join the debate. Participants who exhibited great wisdom stood the chance of being rewarded with [[Genie wish|wishes]] while those who were crass got slapped in the face."
