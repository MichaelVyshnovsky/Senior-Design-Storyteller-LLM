The '''Crypt of Imminent Death''' was a temple dedicated to [[Jergal]], the Forgotten One, found in [[Bezantur]] in [[Thay]].<ref name="PaP-p33" >

==Location==
The temple was located in north-central Bezantur, the so-called "City of a Thousand Temples." It sat across the street from the [[House of Entropy]].

==Structure==

==History==
Death was a fact of daily life in Thay, and as Jergal was a constant presence amidst the death of [[Myrkul]] and the subsequent replacement of [[Cyric]] by [[Kelemvor]] as the primary [[god]] of death following the [[Time of Troubles]], the congregation at the Crypt of Imminent Death steadily grew in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Inhabitants==
[[Dyhna Zhyborrin]] served as high priestess of the Crypt of Imminent Death as of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].
