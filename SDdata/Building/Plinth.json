        "mainbody": "The '''Plinth''' was a temple for all faiths and was the only temple located in the [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It collapsed as a result of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.",
        "Location": "[[File:VirginsSquare-Plinth-1372.png|thumb|right|270px|''Map showing the location of the Plinth (labeled <code>T38</code>) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]\nThe Plinth was located in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] between the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]] and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]. The structure was bordered by three minor streets. [[Lathin's Cut]] came west from the High Road and passed the southern face of the Plinth. It intersected with [[Jelabril Street]], which bordered the tower on the east, and [[Burdag Lane]], which demarked the western edge.\n[[File:VGtW-Plinth.png|thumb|right|270px|''Map showing the immediate surroundings of the Plinth (highlighted in red), ''circa'' 1367 DR.'']]",
        "Structure": "The Plinth was once the tallest building in the Trades Ward and frequently used as a landmark. It was a mighty needle-like tower, six stories tall, shaped as a slender four-sided pyramid with a flat top. Small balconies were placed around the tower at various levels. The flat roof of the tower was used as a landing site for [[griffon]]s and other aerial steeds belonging to private citizens and the [[Griffon Cavalry]].",
        "Activities": "The Plinth belonged to the city and was supported by the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] and private donations. In particular, during the [[Gods' Day]] celebration, merchants lowered prices to those that shared their faith and then donated the difference, either to a temple or to the city earmarked for Plinth upkeep. The Plinth provided worship space for all faiths, but the law prohibited sacrifice of any intelligent being to any god. Despite this, people did fall (or were tossed) from the balconies every year.\n\nThe Plinth was a refuge of warmth in the winter months for many of the city's poorer citizens. [[Adventurer]]s could almost certainly find a [[cleric]] willing to cast spells (perhaps for a price), or get married. At the other end of the social spectrum, the Plinth was selected by [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] as one of the locations for a secret ''[[portal]]'' that could be activated by someone carrying a ''[[Lord's ensemble#Powers|lord's amulet]]'' and speaking a command word. The destination of this ''gate'' was a well-kept secret.\n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[Lyratha Talltankard]] could often be found holding sunrise prayers to [[Lathander]] at the Plinth. [[Shaundakul|Shaundakul's]] priest, [[Juxril Thammarcast]], also used the edifice to hold services. The dwindling [[cult of Ao]] also met at the Plinth on rare occasions.",
        "Defenses": "The Plinth was guarded by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]] around the clock, and the rooftop was held by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Guard]] as a landing place for citizens with flying steeds.",
        "History": "The Plinth was originally owned by [[Lunaven Moonstar]], a [[half-elf]] [[wizard]] and a [[priest]] of [[Selûne]]. In the {{YearlinkName|985}} (the same year that the [[Moonstar (family)|Moonstar]] family was ennobled{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|6}}), he dedicated an altar and shrine to the Moonmaiden atop his tower outside the city walls. It was then known as the Plinth of the Moon and Stars.\n\nLunaven was ambushed and killed by [[Malar]]ites in the {{YearlinkName|1090}}, and, using items found on his body, they ransacked and burned his tower. The Selûnites got their revenge less than two [[tenday]]s later, but the Moonstar family decided to donate the ruined tower to the city in exchange for a plot of land where they would construct a new temple to Our Lady of Silver called the [[High House of Stars]].<ref group=\"note\">There is a discrepancy in the date of the Plinth exchange. ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' (page 154) indicates it was the same year as the Malarites' defeat (1090 DR), whereas ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' (page 44) states the House of the Moon was completed two years after donating the Plinth, which puts it at [[1095 DR]]. The [[Lords of Waterdeep]] rebuilt and refurbished the tower and opened it as an all-faiths temple simply called the Plinth.\n\nIn [[Tarsakh]] of 1367 DR, a dozen followers of [[Cyric]], the Dark Sun, disrupted all services at the Plinth by casting multiple ''[[darkness]]'' spells that engulfed the tower in complete darkness at [[highsun]]. Before they could be rounded up and escorted out of the city, they were attacked by followers of [[Tyr]]. In the skirmish, two Cyricists and four Tyrites lost their lives and the Plinth and a few adjacent buildings suffered some damage. The survivors (four Tyrites and ten Cyricists) were finally arrested and tried at the [[Lord's Court]]. The followers of Tyr were released after paying a fine and the followers of Cyric were banished.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the [[Spellplague]] caused many enchantments everywhere to fail and the Plinth collapsed as a result."
