        "mainbody": "The Eel Revealed was a popular eatery on the grand Promenade of the Cormyrean capital city of Suzail in 15 century DR.\nThe eatery stood on the westernmost part of the second block of buildings off Suzails Horngate. It was located across the Promenade from the crossing of the Mayhap Lane and the Hunt Bide.\nThe Eel Revealed was a popular restaurant famous for its cheese-and-eel pies, sausages, a selection of fortified wines, and strapping young jacks and wenches who served them while flexing their oiled bodies. Another dish served was a big platter of tender cooked morels and eels in sardragon sauce (disdainfully called \"Marsembian glop\" in Castle Obarskyrs kitchens).\nThe restaurant was open for the early dinner service and early hours of the dawn.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Suzailan Lord Arclath Delcastle was a loyal customer of the eatery. Two of the beautiful young oiled waitresses at the time was Emsra and Varimbra, and a cook named Laethla worked the Eels kitchens."
