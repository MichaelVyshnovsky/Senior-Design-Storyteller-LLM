        },

Each weighed {{SI|6000|lbs|k|long=yes}}.\n\nThe riches of Ysawis were housed within the [[Gallery of Antiquities]]. The treasury was warded from unwanted intruders with ''[[Symbol of insanity|symbols of insanity]]'' and a cadre of malevolent [[spectre]]s.\n\nAn overgrown mini jungle within the palace, called the [[King's Garden]], served as a morbid [[undead]] zoo for [[Sumulael]] to monitor is undead monstrous creations.",
        "Activities": "{{Sectstub}}",
        "Defenses": "An elite force of at least 1,000 undead guarded the Jade Palace including undead monsters, ju-ju zombies, and undead [[jungle giant]]s.\n\nThe [[necromancer]]s [[Kazerabet]] and Sumulael added [[Scrying (spell)|antiscrying]] and [[Teleport|antiteleportation]] [[ward]]s in their separate private chambers within the palace. Both necromancers utilized the ''[[improved skull watch]]'' spell to decorate the palace with magical skull sentries that they could communicate with telepathically. Each necromancer had sixteen such skull watchers.\n\nAll of the corridors and halls within the Palace were enchanted with ''[[continual light]]'' spells, making it extremely difficult to navigate the Palace by stealth. Furthermore, undead servants prowled the halls at all hours of the day carrying out their designated tasks.\n\nAn elite core of 300 ju-ju zombies were outfitted with ancient [[banded mail]] and [[shield]]s bearing the ancient symbols of Ysawisâ€“a [[griffon]] and [[vishap]]. The majority of ju-ju zombies wielded [[spear]]s or [[scimitar]]s as weapons, but some carried crossbows or some form of [[polearm]]. \n\nA dozen powerful undead jungle giant slaves, previously of the [[Silent Arrow Clan]], served as elite guards.",

        "Inhabitants": "The undead roaming the Palace would ignore approved visitors unless they turned hostile. Guests caught sneaking around in unauthorized areas would be detained by the undead and interrogated by lieutenants. Punishment for being caught unininvited within the private sections of the palace was meted out by either Sumulael or Kazerabet."
