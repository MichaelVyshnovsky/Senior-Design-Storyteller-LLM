        "mainbody": "The Temple of Sune in Bezantur, Thay, was a place of worship dedicated to Sune that was popular with the locals as a place to meet romantic prospects.\nThe temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". It was quite close to the Temple of Lliira,\nThe temple itself was an elegant palace well suited to events that provided opportunities for entertainment and indulgence.\nOwing to the lavish festivals and feasts hosted at the temple, it was a popular place to socialize and meet potential romantic partners, even or especially among those who did not actively worship Sune.\nThe congregation attracted individuals who were generally not well aligned with the beliefs and attitudes of the ruling Red Wizards of Thay, however they were largely left alone, owing to the fact that they also generally lacked any political power or ambition.\nFollowing the opening of the Temple of Sharess in Bezantur, Sunes following began to dwindle as worshipers flocked to the more openly hedonistic delights of Sharess. By the late 1360s DR, Sunes catty worshipers were actively spreading rumors to portray worshipers of Sharess as crude, uncivilized, and debauched."
