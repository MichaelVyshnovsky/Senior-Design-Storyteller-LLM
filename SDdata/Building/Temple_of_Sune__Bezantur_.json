        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Sune''' in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]], was a place of worship dedicated to [[Sune]] that was popular with the locals as a place to meet romantic prospects.",
        "Location": "The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". It was quite close to the [[Temple of Lliira (Bezantur)|Temple of Lliira]],",
        "Structure": "The temple itself was an elegant palace well suited to events that provided opportunities for entertainment and indulgence.",
        "Activities": "Owing to the lavish festivals and feasts hosted at the temple, it was a popular place to socialize and meet potential romantic partners, even or especially among those who did not actively worship Sune.\n\nThe [[Church of Sune|congregation]] attracted individuals who were generally not well aligned with the beliefs and attitudes of the ruling [[Red Wizards of Thay]], however they were largely left alone, owing to the fact that they also generally lacked any political power or ambition.",
        "History": "Following the opening of the [[Temple of Sharess (Bezantur)|Temple of Sharess]] in Bezantur, Sune's following began to dwindle as worshipers flocked to the more openly hedonistic delights of [[Sharess]]. By the late 1360s [[DR]], Sune's catty worshipers were actively spreading rumors to portray worshipers of Sharess as crude, uncivilized, and debauched."
