        "mainbody": "'''Elonia's Beauty Shoppe''' was a salon located within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "This store was found within the [[Swordspoint]] neighborhood, on [[Rhabie Promenade]], north of the [[Raven's Glory]].",
        "Services": "While the Starre's clientele would come to the salon for pampering and beautification, they would stay to catch up on the latest gossip within the city. Although rich Ravenian women were among their regulars, the motherâ€“daughter team offered haircuts, beauty enhancements (both material and illusory), shaving, manicures and pedicures, and even [[tattoo]]s, to both Ravenian men and women.\n\nIf someone were to make the request, Elonia could use her beautician and [[illusion]] skills to alter their appearance enough to act as a disguise.",
        "Inhabitants": "The salon was run by the strikingly attractive [[illusionist]] [[Elonia Starre]] and her equally beautiful and quite courageous daughter [[Salena Starre|Salena]], who had began a career embarking upon adventures. Their home was located in a room above the store.",
        "History": "Around the same century, the storefront of [[Traagor's Tours and Souvenir Shop]] sold a variety of objects that had slogans advertising local businesses embroidered or painted on them. One such slogan advertised the salon, stating, \"Elonia's Beauty Shoppe, the first step to a better you.\"<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/84/The Living City: Traagor's Tours and Souvenir Shop|11}}"
