Here, the staff bought, sold, and boarded horses in their stables. They could also provide training for horses. Their primary specialty, however, was in veterinary care for horses, mules, and donkeys. The staff could quickly and accurately diagnose a sickness or injury in an animal, and provide proper care for them. They could easily tell if a lame animal had been drugged to hide its condition. Horses in their care were kept in good health, fed well, and exercised appropriately. If they were not, then the owner would be granted a new and better horse in replacement. Sendevers Stables never sold a sick or lame horse.
