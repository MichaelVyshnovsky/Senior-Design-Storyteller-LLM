        "Activities": "Because of the beautiful decorations and intimate atmosphere, the third court was a favored spot for romantic meetings. Many of the bowers here were enchanted to block unwanted eavesdropping, making them ideal for these meetings. However, some were enchanted to relay messages to the [[Alyana al-Azzazi|Grand Vizier's]] attention.",
        "Inhabitants": "Priests of [[Selan]] grew the rarest flowers in all of [[Zakhara]] within the Court of Grandeur. A pair of [[singing tree]]s could also be found here."
