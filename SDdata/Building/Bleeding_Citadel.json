        "mainbody": "The '''Bleeding Citadel''' was a holy sanctuary that was found on the plane of [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|134}}\n\n{{Quote|Against evil, we stand united. Only the pure of heart can part these holy gates.|Inscription on the front doors of the Bleeding Citadel.}}",
        "Location": "The citadel sat atop and within the massive mound of unidentifiable mass of seemingly living tissue referred to as [[the Scab]]. Great [[chain]]s of [[infernal iron]] bound the citadel to the ground surrounding the living hill.",
        "Structure": "The [[alabaster]] temple was partially covered by the disgusting mass of the Scab, to the point where little more than its domed roof was still visible.{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|135}}\n\nThe citadel's absorption by the Scab was an ongoing process, believed by some to fully envelop it by some point. The temple's massive brass doors had been wholly enveloped within the depths of the Scab tissue.{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|138}}{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|139}}",

            "Atmosphere": "By some unknown means, a bright and restorative sunlight shone through the glass windows of the temple, regardless of the surrounding landscape. It removed grit and grime from possessions and offered a sense of rejuvenation to those within."

        "Purpose": "The citadel was created with one singular motivation, to house and keep safe the ''Sword of Zariel'' so that it could not be claimed by the forces of [[evil]].",
        "History": "The Bleeding Citadel was formed after the events of The Ride, when the Zariel led the [[Hellriders]] of [[Elturel]] into a losing battle in Avernus, offering her services to [[Asmodeus]], and becoming an [[archdevil]] herself. [[Yael]], Zariel's most loyal soldier, and [[Lulu]], her golden [[mastadon]] mount took Zariel's sword and made sacrifices of themselves to create a sanctuary for its safekeeping. Yael gave up her life and Lulu sacrificed both her memories and magical powers.{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|145}}",
        "Inhabitants": "The only known inhabitant of the Bleeding Citadel was the [[ghost]] of Yael, Zariel's most loyal follower.{{Template:Cite book/Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|140}}",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was believed that if a worthy individual [[attunement|attuned]] themself to the ''sword of Zariel'' and removed it from its dais the entire citadel would be destroyed in an explosion of light."
