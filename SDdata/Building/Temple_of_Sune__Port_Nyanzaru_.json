        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Sune''' in [[Port Nyanzaru]], [[Chult]] was a place of worship dedicated to [[Sune]], worshiped as the [[god]]ess of love and beauty.",
        "Location": "The temple sat on a small, rocky island in the [[Bay of Chult]] just off the coast of Port Nyanzaru, and was considered to be part of the city's [[Port Nyanzaru/Merchants' Ward|Merchants' Ward]]. It sat atop a cliff, and could only be accessed either by a small harbor at the base of a winding and steep staircase or via an elevated bridge between the island and the northside of [[Temple Hill (Port Nyanzaru)|Temple Hill]].",
        "Structure": "The outer walls of the temple were lined with [[mirror]]s, which could make it appear that the roof was floating in the air when seen from a distance.",
        "Services": "Visitors to the temple could visit the public baths or receive instruction from the [[Sunite]] devotees about improving their appearance, such as learning how to apply make-up, style their hair, or dress fashionably and appropriately for their station and body type. Both the temple's congregation as well as casual visitors could access the temple's many services, and those who the [[priest]]s saw as ugly or lacking charisma were dotted on with advice and sympathy.",
        "History": "In the century following the disappearance of [[Ubtao]], Sune became one of the more popular [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian gods]] among the people of Port Nyanzaru The temple also sponsored and operated the city's [[Public bathhouse (Port Nyanzaru)|public bathhouse]] in the [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city owing to a history of exploitation, and so the Sunite priesthood had come to be composed of native [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]]."
