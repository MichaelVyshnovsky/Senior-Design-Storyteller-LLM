        "mainbody": "The Temple of Sune in Port Nyanzaru, Chult was a place of worship dedicated to Sune, worshiped as the godess of love and beauty.\nThe temple sat on a small, rocky island in the Bay of Chult just off the coast of Port Nyanzaru, and was considered to be part of the citys Merchants Ward. It sat atop a cliff, and could only be accessed either by a small harbor at the base of a winding and steep staircase or via an elevated bridge between the island and the northside of Temple Hill.\nThe outer walls of the temple were lined with mirrors, which could make it appear that the roof was floating in the air when seen from a distance.\nVisitors to the temple could visit the public baths or receive instruction from the Sunite devotees about improving their appearance, such as learning how to apply make-up, style their hair, or dress fashionably and appropriately for their station and body type. Both the temples congregation as well as casual visitors could access the temples many services, and those who the priests saw as ugly or lacking charisma were dotted on with advice and sympathy.\nIn the century following the disappearance of Ubtao, Sune became one of the more popular Faer√ªnian gods among the people of Port Nyanzaru The temple also sponsored and operated the citys public bathhouse in the Market Ward.\nBy the late 15 century DR, foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city owing to a history of exploitation, and so the Sunite priesthood had come to be composed of native Chultans."
