        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Playhouse''' was a prominent landmark located in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Location": "The Grand Playhouse was located in central Daggerford along [[Duke's Way]], the [[High Road (Daggerford)|High Road]], and the [[Farmer's Road]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}",
        "Description": "The building was one of the largest structures in Daggerford, rivalling, if not surpassing, the [[Ducal Castle]] in size.",
        "Activities": "Despite its impressive scope, the Grand Playhouse was rarely used for its intended purpose. The entire building was enchanted with a ward that prevented sound from exiting any opening into the structure. This was set in place by the building's owner in order to prevent non-paying customers from enjoying music and theater for free. Given the number of bloodstains marring the surfaces of the Grand Playhouse's interior found after its abandonment, it appeared that [[assassin]]s and other violent criminals were using the ward to their nefarious advantage.",
        "History": "The Grand Playhouse was designed and constructed by Maestro [[Samous|Samous the Rapturous Songster]] with the intention of bringing culture to Daggerford. Samous recruited the brightest actors and opera singers from much larger cities to perform within the Grand Playhouse, but the citizens of Daggerford showed little to no interest in that form of entertainment. Samous eventually went broke and was forced to close the doors. He left the city shortly thereafter."
