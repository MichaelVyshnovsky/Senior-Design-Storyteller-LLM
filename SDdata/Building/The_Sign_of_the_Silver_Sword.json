        "mainbody": "he Sign of the Silver Sword was an inn in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe inn was located in Berdusks market quarter area, along the main road that entered the city via its southeastern gate.\nThe inn was large and well-built, with lush soundproof carpeting throughout and driftglobes used as lighting within the rooms. The place was extremely quiet, but well-furnished. Guest rooms each contained a bath, a writing table, a canopied bed, and a soft easy chair. Each room also had privacy bars that could be placed to block doors and windows from within.\nthumb|Hot river crabs from The Sign of the Silver Sword, which Volo reviewed very favorably during his visit.\nAside from lush living arrangements, the inn provided food of fair quality, often using very fresh ingredients sourced from the River Chionthar. However, service itself was almost nonexistent, with the staff speaking little and taking long periods of time to fulfill requests from guests."
