        "mainbody": "The '''Master's Library''' was a temple of [[Deneir]] on [[Iron Dragon Mountain]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] between [[Impiltur]] and [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. It was the greatest depository of books on [[Toril]] and the site where the [[Metatext]] was pieced together.",
        "History": "Iron Dragon Mountain was once the lair of the [[mist dragon]] [[Ouranalathra|Ouranalathra the Mistmaiden]], but later became the site of the Master's Library.",
        "Inhabitants": "The Master's Library was home to about sixty [[High Librarian]]s, the highest ranking and most ancient members of the Deneirrath clergy. In the late 1360s and 1370s DR, they were led by [[Librarian Supreme]] [[Haliduth Orspriir]]. He and the other High Librarians could read any known written language.\n\nThe greatest number of [[truenamer]]s devoted to Deneir could also be found here. Many of them worked on the Metatext.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Truenamers}}",
        "Defense": "The location of both Iron Dragon Mountain and the Master's Library was generally unknown. It was supported by the [[Reading Room]], a small stronghold far to the south that most pilgrims visited. \n\nFor defense of the temple, Haliduth called upon eight mist dragons that dwelled in neighboring mountains, ranging in [[dragon aging|age from mature adult to great wyrm]].",
        "Activities": "The Master's Library held more books than any other library in the world, including [[Candlekeep]], the [[Library of Curna]], and the biggest libraries of [[Shou Lung]]. It included samples of every known written language, even [[draconic language]]s.\n\nThe [[Metatext]], the mythical ideal text sought by Deneir and his faithful, was recorded and pieced together at the Master's Library. The most likely fragments of text discovered by Deneir's clerics were sent to the Library to be included. It was continually growing but incomplete, and kept by the Librarian Supreme himself.\n\nAt least once in their lives, every devout follower of Deneir made a pilgrimage to the Master's Library, though few got past the Reading Room. A nonliving matter–only ''[[gate]]'' spell allowed notes and texts to be passed between the two, so that copies of texts could be lent to visitors."
