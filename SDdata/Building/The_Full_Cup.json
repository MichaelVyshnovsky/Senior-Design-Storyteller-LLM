The interior was small and poorly lit. A long bar dominated the main room. An impressive array of bottles adorned the wall behind the bar. The bottles were covered by an equally impressive layer of dust.\nThe Full Cups patrons were mostly caravan drovers. Brawls were a common occurance in this seedy tavern.\nAside from the frequent brawls and frigid winter drafts, the Full Cup was known for serving delicious buttered mushrooms for 1 cp per bowl. The mushrooms were actually grown in-house in the dung cellars beneath the tavern. The dung pile was quite deep and the Full Cups proprietor would hide items beneath it for customers who knew how to ask for a fee of 5 gp for a month, after which time the items were forfeited if not claimed.\nThe Full Cup was owned by a man named Gulth Djanczo."
