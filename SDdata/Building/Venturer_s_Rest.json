The proprietor [[Juetta Bealcrest|Juetta]] was particularly welcoming, catering to those individuals that were new to the city.{{Template:Cite book/Neverwinter Campaign Setting|168}} Quite unfortunately the Dwarf did not cater to any [[spellscarred]] citizens of the city.\n\nBy the {{yearlinkName|1489}}, the renamed Venturer's Rest had become a favored stop for [[adventurer]]s that were staying at Helm's Hold.",
        "History": "While many businesses in Helm's Hold were forced to close down during difficult years that plagued Helm's Hold in the latter half of the 15{{th}} century, the Old Dirty Dwarf stood strong.\n\nWhen the Prophet [[Rohini]] rose to power in the Helm's Hold some time before the {{yearlinkName|1479}}, the inn became a point of interest for her [[foulspawn]] agents. They monitored all the out-of-towners who passed through its doors and reported their findings to their [[devil]]ish leader.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Helm's Hold]] that same year, the inn was used as a base of operations by Councilwoman [[Alisara Callum]] during her efforts to aid the reclamation of the city.\n\nYears after the Prophet's demise, sometime between [[1485 DR|1485]] and [[1489 DR]], the Old Dirty Dwarf came under the ownership of [[Kharissa Anuvien]], a [[paladin]] of [[Chauntea]] who was new to the city. She gave the inn the more dignified name the Venturer's Rest and it remained a favored establishment for the people of Helm's Hold."
