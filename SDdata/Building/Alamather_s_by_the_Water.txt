'''Almather's by the Water''' was a shop in [[Berdusk]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] that specialized in selling rare or unique weapons that were better suited for showmanship or worship than for actual battle.

==Location==
The small shop sits on the [[Gollahaer]], the shorter street that crossed the [[Clearspring]]. It was fairly close to the bookstore [[Ondraer's Fine Pages]].

==Services==
Almather's by the Water specialized in one-of-a-kind, rare, or unusual weaponry. Examples included [[sword cane|cane-swords]], [[gauntlet]]s fitted with hidden [[dagger]] blades in the fingers, and barbed-wire [[whip]]s. The shop also carried a wide array of [[trap]]ped items, many set up to deliver lethal doses of [[poison]], but the shop could not provide poisons by itself since the sale of venoms and toxins was banned within Berdusk.

Because of the nature of the store's wares, it was frequented by caravan merchants and professional killers.
