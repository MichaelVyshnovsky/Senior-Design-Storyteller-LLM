Almathers by the Water was a shop in Berdusk in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR that specialized in selling rare or unique weapons that were better suited for showmanship or worship than for actual battle.
The small shop sits on the Gollahaer, the shorter street that crossed the Clearspring. It was fairly close to the bookstore Ondraers Fine Pages.
Almathers by the Water specialized in one-of-a-kind, rare, or unusual weaponry. Examples included cane-swords, gauntlets fitted with hidden dagger blades in the fingers, and barbed-wire whips. The shop also carried a wide array of trapped items, many set up to deliver lethal doses of poison, but the shop could not provide poisons by itself since the sale of venoms and toxins was banned within Berdusk.
Because of the nature of the stores wares, it was frequented by caravan merchants and professional killers.
