'''Flora's Flower Shop''',{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3}} also known as '''Flora's Flowers''', was a flower shop in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Sometime around [[1370 DR]] it was bought by the [[Ampner]]s, torn down, and in its place an apartment complex was built. This building continued to house the shop on its ground floor, at no rental charge to the eponymous [[Flora (Ravenian)|Flora]].

==Location==
This shop stood along [[Blacktree Boulevard South]], in the [[Anvil (neighborhood)|Anvil]] neighborhood of the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] district. Prior to its buyout and demolition by the Ampners, it acted as the only entrance into the secretive market of [[Flask Circle]].

==Structure==
The original shop stood only a single story tall and lacked any exterior signage. Tall, brick walls stood on both sides of its exterior, filling the gaps between it and neighboring buildings. The apartment complex built in its place stood four stories tall and had a rooftop garden that was the envy of the Anvil neighborhood.
===Interior===
The original shop had long, black curtains covering much of its walls,{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|4}} A stone hung from the ceiling that emitted a strong ''[[continual light]]'' effect, which reflected off the multitude of colors exhibited by the flowers on display. These flowers were all housed within small water barrels.

==Services==
As its name implied, this shop sold a wide variety of flowers. Prices ranged from [[copper piece]]s for more common flowers, such as bunches of [[daisies]], to three [[silver piece]]s for a bloom of more exotic fare.

==Inhabitants==
The topmost floor of the revised building, the "penthouse suite", was kept aside by the Ampners for their own personal use. According to rumors, it was often used to house any adventurers the Ampners contracted to carry out unpleasant tasks on their behalf.

==History==
Around the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s wandered around the streets of Anvil for about an hour, having been spent by the [[alchemist]] [[Wendell]] in search of Flora's Flowers and the marketplace it concealed as he needed a number of ingredients for his latest [[potion]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|2-3}} Eventually they found the shop, which at the time had a [[bucket]] outside holding some wilting [[black-eyed susan]]s and sign above them, written in [[Common]], inviting customers to "Hep yoreselfs to a free flowa." When they entered the shop and inquired about the Flask Circle, Flora explained to the adventurers that they had to purchase and wear one of her flowers or wear one of the black-eyed susans outside, as wearing a flower acted as a sort of badge of official entry whilst in the hidden market.
