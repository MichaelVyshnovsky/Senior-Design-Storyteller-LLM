'''Kryptgarden Scrolls''' was the sole library located in [[Daggerford]]. It was said to contain over a thousand score [[book]]s, [[scroll]]s, and other individual documents.

==Location==
It was located on the north side of the town's [[Money Quarter]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Structure==
The three-story building was protected by a [[magic]]al [[ward]] that shielded the structure, and everything within, from any manner of fire and lightning.

==Activities==
The library catered to the scribes and scholars that were sanctioned by the [[Scribes' Friendship]] guild. They spent much of their time copying, chronicling, and categorizing all of the works contained within its shelves.

While anyone could spend time within the library's entrance hall, only guild scribes were allowed to access its archives. Members of the [[Thinkers' Fraternity]] were allowed to access its books free of charge.
