        "mainbody": "he Roving Dragon was an inn and restaurant in Suzail, Cormyr and owned by Caladarea Ithbeck.\nThe inn was located on the promenade above Braundlaes Best, a tavern run by Braundlae. \nThe establishment was created by knocking through doorways into several adjoining buildings on the upper floor. Customers entered via several staircases from the tavern below, and these bars served to bring the Roving Dragon customers in exchange for it not competing with their drink trade. Its prices are kept reasonable by serving simple but good food.\nThe sunny chamber at the eastern end of the Dragon was called the Snout Room, and afforded a good view of the Royal Gardens past the court buildings.\nThe restaurant served cider, meat tarts, soursweet fish tarts, and soups.\nCategoryBusinesses\nCategoryInns\nCategoryRestaurants\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in Suzail\nCategoryLocations in Cormyr\nCategoryLocations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\n7ktopjcdc0ts2o7orja3snvnot1whl7"
