The Jailgates was a civic building in Elversult that held its legal courthouse, jail cells, infirmary, and the barracks of the city guard known as the Maces.
It was located in the northern portion of the city, one block north of Elversult Hall, acting as a sort of border between the residences of wealthy Elversians and the surrounding cityscape.
The Jailgates was nothing short of a fortress, with dense foundations and well-protected underground chambers.
The infirmary of the Jailgates served as the resting place for the body of Lady Lord Yanseldara for a while in the , when she was put in a catatonic state for some time by the dracolich Hethcypressarvil.
