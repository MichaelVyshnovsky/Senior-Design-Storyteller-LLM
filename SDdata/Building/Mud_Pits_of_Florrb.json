        "mainbody": "The '''Mud Pits of Florrb''' were a set of three pits of mud on the [[Snout of Omgar]] overseen by a [[mud mephit]] named [[Florrb]].",
        "Usage": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[tortle]]s of [[Ahoyhoy]] liked to come to the mud pits to bathe and relax. They conversed with Florrb in [[Aquan]].",
        "Planar Portal": "Each of the pools was a planar ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. To be activated, the pools had to be exposed to an open flame, signifying all four elements: air and fire for the open flame, and water and earth for the mud. Once activated, a creature needed only to submerge themselves in the mud to be transported. A creature on the Elemental Plane of Earth did not need an open flame to travel to the [[material plane]]."
