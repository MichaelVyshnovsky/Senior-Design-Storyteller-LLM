        "mainbody": "lstearns Escorts was a hireling agency located on just north of Lolths Web, in the West Wall neighborhood of Menzoberranzan.\nElstearns offered the unrestricted services of smart, neat, charming, and attractive drow of either gender to its clientele. While many clients hired the escorts for simple, carnal pleasures, the business had a surprisingly expansive pool of hirelings with skill sets beyond these services, such as articulate and charismatic escorts for social functions, guides and interpreters for visitors to the city, and capable bodyguards who could escort clients in dangerous areas of Menzoberranzan and even on quick excursions into the tunnels just outside the city."
