'''Castle Morlin''' was the seat of power for the [[Barony of Steeping Falls]] until its collapse in the early 5{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was named after the [[vampire]] known as the Baron of Blood, [[Artor Morlin]].

==Location==
The castle was located on the side of a hill overlooking the [[Delimbiyr River]].

==Structure==
Beneath the castle was a winding network of dungeons. These remained for over a thousand years after the castle's destruction.

==History==
In the 3{{rd}} century DR, the castle stood at the eastern edge of the [[Halangorn Forest]] and its lord claimed the title Lord Protector of the [[Sword Hills]] in addition to Baron of Steeping Falls.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign}}

After the collapse of the barony, in the {{YearlinkName|403}} the castle became the lair of horrifying beasts and malevolent [[undead]]. Folks from the surrounding areas avoided the ruins of the fallen castle.

In the {{YearlinkName|931}}, the young merchant's son [[Tyndal]] famously defended his family from a band of [[lizardfolk]] armed with only a [[dagger]], very near the castle's former location. Some [[947 DR|16 years later]] he founded his own duchy, and began construction of [[Castle Daggerford]] directly over its ruins.
