        "Description": "The holy house was actually a series of short, stone buildings of dwarven architecture, with tall, spiked iron fences.\n\nWithin the ''abbai'' was a trading post where the dwarves dealt their precious [[gem]]s and [[magic item]]s. The friendly and amiable [[priest]]s of the Trove Lord were also unscrupulous merchants, who preyed upon the gullible and naive patrons who visited their mercantile house of worship."
