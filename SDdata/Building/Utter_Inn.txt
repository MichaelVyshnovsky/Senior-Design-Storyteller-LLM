The '''Utter Inn''' was found in the small settlement of [[Bogbrook]] in [[Cormyr]].

==Activities==
For those who'd visited this [[inn]], its name probably reminded them of the [[utterdark]] wine served there. In addition to the wine, the inn also served warm [[ale]] and [[cider]], which were both well received.

==Description==
The Utter Inn suffered from poor illumination, small rooms, and a damp atmosphere, making it a difficult place to spend the night. The smell of mildew permeated each and every room.
