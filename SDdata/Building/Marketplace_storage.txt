The '''marketplace storage''' was a large warehouse located in the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Description==
The building was made from stone and wood.

==Location==
The warehouse was located along [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] in northwest Daggerford next to the market and [[Caravan Gate]].

==Activities==
Merchants with stalls in the nearby market could use the storage shed to house their wares overnight without risk of them being stolen or damaged by the elements if left out in the market. Members of the [[Daggerford militia]] kept a constant vigil on the building making it very difficult for opportunistic [[thieves]] to snatch anything.
