'''Anaster's Leatherworks''' was a [[leather]]goods business in the city of [[Ordulin]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Services==
Anaster's sold a variety of different goods made of leather, including [[leather ball]]s that came in {{SIAdj|2|in|long=yes}}, {{SIAdj|4|in|long=yes}}, and {{SIAdj|8|in|long=yes}} sizes.

==History==
Sometime in the mid–14{{th}} century DR, having took notice that Anaster's leather balls were more durable than any others made in [[Faerûn]] at the time, [[Aurora]] struck up an exclusive licensing deal with Anaster's to have [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|her catalogue]] be the only business that could export their balls beyond the borders of [[Sembia]].
