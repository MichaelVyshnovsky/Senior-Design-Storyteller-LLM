The '''Sword and Sextant''' was a map shop located in the subterranean city of [[Skullport]] deep beneath the grand metropolis of [[Waterdeep]]. It could be found within the south-eastern region of the city's lowest level, known as [[Dredge|the Dredge]].

==History==
During the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Sword and Sextant was overseen by its owner, the [[Tethyrian]] map-maker [[Aekyl Dafyre]]. 

By the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} it was being run by a pair of [[Strongheart halfling|halfling]] brothers, [[Oleander]] and [[Will]]. They sought to procure any accurate maps that portrayed a precise layout of [[Undermountain]].
