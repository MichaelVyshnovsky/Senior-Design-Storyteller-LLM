The Plate of Eels was a restaurant in the village of Hultail that provided a good view over the nearby lake of Wyvernwater.
This restaurant served a variety of seafood. This included freshwater crayfish, eels, fish, and clams. They also served beer and roasted chicken with almonds.
This tavern was named for having once been the site of a wizard slaying a blue dragon.
Around 1368 DR, the Plate of Eels was visited by Volothamp Geddarm. The traveler noted in his book Volos Guide to Cormyr that the beer it served was rather good and strong.
