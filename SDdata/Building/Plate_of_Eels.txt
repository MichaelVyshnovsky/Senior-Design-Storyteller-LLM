The '''Plate of Eels''' was a restaurant in the village of [[Hultail]] that provided a good view over the nearby lake of [[Wyvernwater]].

==Services==
This restaurant served a variety of seafood. This included freshwater [[crayfish]], [[eel]]s, [[fish]], and [[clam]]s. They also served [[beer]] and roasted [[chicken]] with [[almond]]s.

==History==
This tavern was named for having once been the site of a [[wizard]] slaying a [[blue dragon]].

Around [[1368 DR]], the Plate of Eels was visited by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. The traveler noted in his book [[Volo's Guide to Cormyr (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to Cormyr'']] that the beer it served was rather good and strong.
