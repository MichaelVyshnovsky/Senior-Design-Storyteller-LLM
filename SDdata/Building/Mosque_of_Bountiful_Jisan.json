Generous donations guaranteed one a fine seat for a ceremony.\n\nThe bounty of Jisan concluded every ceremony. Priests summoned rain to moisten the faithful before servants brought food and wine for a feast. Proper form included only eating a little food during the feast. The faithful were encouraged to take food to give to beggars on their way home."
