One Foot in the Boat was a bustling tavern found in the city of Yartar. It was favored by merchants and adventurers alike, by both Yartarran residents and traders from neighboring settlements and beyond.
It was located just south of Yartars marketplace, known locally as the Fishyard.
The tavern was a noisy and outright exciting place to spend an evening. It often left its patrons with fond memories that were slightly better when remembered than when they actually played out.
It was a great place to hear outlandish stories and possibly even hear about some grand plot with which a group of adventurers could involve themselves.
