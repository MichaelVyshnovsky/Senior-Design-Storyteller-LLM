'''Multhimmer the Merchant''' was a general store located in [[Ashabenford]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}} The owner of the shop, [[Multhimmer]], preferred to deal in imported glassware, furniture and fine metal goods such as [[lamp]]s, [[platter]]s, [[wall hook]]s, adornments and ornamental pieces. The prices of the shop were set fairly high, about 20% higher than those found from streetside stalls in [[Sembia]].  

There were occasionally stolen goods that were offered in Multhimmer's shop but he never acquired pilfered goods as a fence.
