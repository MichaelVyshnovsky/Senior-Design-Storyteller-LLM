The '''Temple of the Red Mountain''' was a temple of the [[Red Mountain Sect]] in [[Manass]] in [[Khazari]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Description==
The Temple of the Red Mountain was a small structure constantly under threat from an assortment of attacks from rivals.

==Inhabitants==
The temple was home to nineteen [[shukenja]] of the Red Mountain Sect.

==Activities==
The temple was constantly attacked and harassed by [[sohei]] of the [[Yellow Mountain Sect]], and it had lost the governor's support. Though outnumbered, the shukenja of the Red Mountain Sect met these attacks with fierce resistance. Were it not for the favor of Prince [[Ogandi]], the temple and its followers would have surely been driven from Manass.
