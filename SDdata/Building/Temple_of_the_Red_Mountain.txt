The Temple of the Red Mountain was a temple of the Red Mountain Sect in Manass in Khazari in 1367 DR.
The Temple of the Red Mountain was a small structure constantly under threat from an assortment of attacks from rivals.
The temple was home to nineteen shukenja of the Red Mountain Sect.
The temple was constantly attacked and harassed by sohei of the Yellow Mountain Sect, and it had lost the governors support. Though outnumbered, the shukenja of the Red Mountain Sect met these attacks with fierce resistance. Were it not for the favor of Prince Ogandi, the temple and its followers would have surely been driven from Manass.
