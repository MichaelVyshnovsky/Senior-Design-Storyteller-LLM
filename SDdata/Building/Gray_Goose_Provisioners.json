        "mainbody": "'''Gray Goose Provisioners''' was a store in [[Eshpurta]] run by [[Carn Wittsome]] and his mistress, [[Nethris Perndle]]. The Gray Goose carried good trail [[ration]]s and other small supplies for those that needed or wanted to travel. Prices were very reasonable but sometimes it was awkward interrupting an argument between the two proprietors to make a purchase—the elderly couple bickered constantly on just about every topic. The shop was located next door to [[Bhamm's Herbs]] in the southern quarter of the city.",
