The '''Baths of Garimsharr''' were a bathhouse ruin in [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]].

==Structure==
The Baths of Garimsharr were a massive rose-colored building; it had three entrances, all of which led into a {{SI|10|foot|long=yes|adj=yes}}wide gallery {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} above the ground; on the ground level, there were three pairs of {{SI|70|foot|long=yes}} pillars leading to the ceiling. Those pillars were ornately carved to resemble legendary beasts; four pools lay between the pillars. Four more pools lay at the corners of the room, and there was a drain.

The drain led across a nest of [[spider|red spiders]] towards a manhole, which opened before a statue of [[Set]].

==Inhabitants==
About thirteen skeletons remained in reserve within the pools. A [[wraith]], the spirit of [[Krinos Pandipolous]], was hidden in the drain and would command the skeletons if it saw an opportunity to slay adventurers.
