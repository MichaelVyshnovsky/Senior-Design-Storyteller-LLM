Boonmoppets tower was a small wizards tower inherited occupied by a familiar named Boonmoppet sometime before 1372 DR.
Boonmoppets tower stood at a crossroads in the Western Farmlands outside the walls of Daggerford. Across the way from the tower stood an old mossy milestone, old enough for its markings to be weathered with time.
The structure itself was circular and only consisted of several floors with a single entrance door and small arrow-slit windows.
The true size of the tower was hidden behind its misleading humble appearance. The main room past the entrance door was adorned in a typical arcane fashion, filled with devices, bookshelves, and magical knickknacks. Another smaller room that was used as a lab was located directly across from the towers entrance.
The tower belonged to an evil conjurer with deep connections to the plane of Baator. Eventually, the wizard transformed himself into a lich. The lich traded with the local farmers and provided them with potions and ointments. Boonmoppet faithfully served the undead creature for several lifetimes before a group of do-gooders from Waterdeep discovered the lich and slew him, leaving the imp Boonmoppet alone and in charge of the tower.
By 1372 DR, Boonmoppet was still in charge of his deceased masters tower and his stock of magical curiosities. The imp opened the towers doors to anyone who was willing to trade with him without trying to slay poor Boonmoppet.
