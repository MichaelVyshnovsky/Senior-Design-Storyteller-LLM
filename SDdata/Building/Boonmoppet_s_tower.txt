'''Boonmoppet's tower''' was a small [[wizard]]'s tower inherited occupied by a [[familiar]] named [[Boonmoppet]] sometime before [[1372 DR]].

==Location==
Boonmoppet's tower stood at a crossroads in the [[Western Farmlands]] outside the walls of [[Daggerford]]. Across the way from the tower stood an old [[moss]]y milestone, old enough for its markings to be weathered with time.

==Structure==
The structure itself was circular and only consisted of several floors with a single entrance door and small arrow-slit windows.

==Interior==
The true size of the tower was hidden behind its misleading humble appearance. The main room past the entrance door was adorned in a typical arcane fashion, filled with devices, bookshelves, and magical knickknacks. Another smaller room that was used as a lab was located directly across from the tower's entrance.

==History==
The tower belonged to an evil [[conjurer]] with deep connections to the plane of [[Baator]]. Eventually, the wizard transformed himself into a [[lich]]. The lich traded with the local farmers and provided them with [[potion]]s and ointments. Boonmoppet faithfully served the [[undead]] creature for several lifetimes before a group of do-gooders from [[Waterdeep]] discovered the lich and slew him, leaving the [[imp]] Boonmoppet alone and in charge of the tower.

By 1372 DR, Boonmoppet was still in charge of his deceased master's tower and his stock of magical curiosities. The imp opened the tower's doors to anyone who was willing to trade with him without trying to slay poor Boonmoppet.
