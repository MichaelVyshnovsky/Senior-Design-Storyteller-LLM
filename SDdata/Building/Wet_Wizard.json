        "History": "It opened some time after the [[Zhentarim]] takeover of Llorkh in [[1357 DR]]. Townsfolk were pressed into the construction of two new but ugly taverns. The Wet Wizard was in business by [[1366 DR]] and through [[1370 DR]].",
        "Description": "The travelogue writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] presumed it to be a pretty poor place, but hadn't been able to visit to judge.\n\nLord [[Geildarr]], a mage and ruler of Llorkh, was uncertain if the name \"Wet Wizard\" was a mocking reference to him or not."
