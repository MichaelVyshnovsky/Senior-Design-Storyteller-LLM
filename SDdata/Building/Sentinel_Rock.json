        "mainbody": "'''Sentinel Rock''' was a small shrine to [[Helm]] found near [[Espar]] in [[Cormyr]]. It was overseen by the settlement's founder, and former clergyman [[church of Helm|Helm's church]], [[Hezom]].",
        "Location": "The shrine was situated within a cavern set inside a steep cliff, also named Sentinel Rock, that stood just west of the [[King's Forest]]. It was accessible by crawling through of a small passageway whose opening was located about halfway up Sentinel Rock's cliffside.",
        "Description": "The shrine's altar featured a magical [[sword of dancing|animated sword]] known as the ''[[Vigilant Blade]]'' that would awaken and defend any of Helm's faithful that came before it.\n\nThe altar itself was illuminated by light that shone through a single crack within the ceiling of the cavern within Sentinel Rock.",
        "Interior": "The cavern in Sentinel Rock also held a hidden cache containing a sister weapon to ''Vigilant Blade'', a ''+2 [[Holy (weapon quality)|holy]] [[keen]] sword'' that was blessed by Helm himself. This weapon could be adopted for a time by one of Helm's faithful to complete a quest in his name, but had to be returned for fear of invoking their god's ire.",
        "Activities": "Sentinel Rock was a destination for Helmite pilgrims from well beyond Espar."
