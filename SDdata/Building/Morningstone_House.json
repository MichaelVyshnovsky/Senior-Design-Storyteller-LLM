Both were situated in an out-of-the-way stretch of the [[Sunset Vale]], in the valley where the [[Dusk Road]] intersected with the [[Uldoon Trail]].\n\nIt was one of several smaller shrines, including those to [[A House of Joy|Lliira]] and [[Goldcoin House|Waukeen]], that encircled the larger, yet rundown [[House of the Suffering God|temple]] of [[Ilmater]]."
