The Lure of Jaws was a dwarven-built lair filled with an abundance of traps. 
It was situated deep within the Fang in the Forest, above where its draconic owner made its home.
Created for the ancient green dragon Aglaraerose, the Lure of Jaws was a lair built by a band of dwarves that were forced to construct it for the dragon. The lair itself was filled with numerous traps. After its construction, rumors were spread by the dwarven builders that a great treasure lied deep within its halls. This lead to the death of countless adventurers. Aglaraerose lurked beneath this set of rooms.
