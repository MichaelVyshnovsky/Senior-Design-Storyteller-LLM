The '''Fortress of the Five Vultures''' was a castle in the city of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]]. Calauntans jokingly called it '''"the Sevensroost"'''.

==Description==
It lay on the eastern end of Calaunt, and was the largest structure in the city. It was a massive baronial-style castle. The fortress was joined by a weathered, flying stone bridge to the Keep of the Scepter.

==Activities==
During the 14th century [[DR]], the fortress served as the headquarters of the [[Supreme Scepter]] and the [[Merchant Duke]]s, as well as a barracks and jail.

==History==
Prior to Calaunt's rise as a city, it was held by a band of robber-barons. They constructed the Fortress of the Five Vultures, and it was named for them.

Around the 1330s DR, [[Bellas's Band]], an [[adventuring company]], took over Calaunt, and occupied the Fortress as their headquarters. Thereafter, locals called it "the Sevensroost".

==Inhabitants==
Supreme Scepter [[Bellas Thanatar]] dwelled in the Keep of the Scepter. The Merchant Dukes lived in palatial houses close to the fortress.

The [[wizard]]s [[Thogaf]] and [[Yrlamar]] were once held in the dungeons below the fortress for a long time.{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|549|Thogaf}}
