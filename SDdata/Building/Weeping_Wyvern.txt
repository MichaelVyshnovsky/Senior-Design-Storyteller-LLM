The Weeping Wyvern was an inn in the city of Tantras in the Vast. 
The Weeping Wyvern lay close by the eastern wall of Tantras, at the end of Stumble Street.
It was a large, good-quality establishment, with high prices but often crowded.
The Weeping Wyvern was still fairly new in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. During the Time of Troubles of that year, it avoided being commandeered by the Guard of Tantras for use as an army barracks.
