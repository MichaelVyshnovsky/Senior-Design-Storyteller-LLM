Orochs Stride was a portal to the Abyss located in Scornubel.
For years, a human merchant Oroch controlled the portal which linked Scornubel to Morglon-Daar. After disappearing on an adventure, Tarnrose, a drow wizard and her gang took up residence over the gateway, charging 66 gp for all creatures who could pass through the gate within a two minute time-span.
