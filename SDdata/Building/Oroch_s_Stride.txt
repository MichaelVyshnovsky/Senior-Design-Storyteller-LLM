'''Oroch's Stride''' was a portal to the [[Abyss]] located in [[Scornubel]].

==History==
For years, a [[human]] merchant [[Oroch]] controlled the portal which linked [[Scornubel]] to [[Morglon-Daar]]. After disappearing on an adventure, [[Tarnrose]], a [[drow]] [[wizard]] and her gang took up residence over the gateway, charging 66 gp for all creatures who could pass through the gate within a two minute time-span.
