The '''Temple of Umberlee''' was the main place of worship of the Great Queen of the Sea [[Umberlee]] in the capital of [[Doegan]] – [[Eldrinpar]].

==Location==
The temple stood off the docks of Eldrinpar, connected to a large decorated plaza, aptly named the [[Plaza of Umberlee]]. A set of wooden harbors was built off it with many fishing boats attached and swaying in the waves of the [[Great Sea]]. A thin causeway led from the docks to the temple that rose about fifty yards away in the waters of the harbor.

==Structure==
Like all temples in the [[Five Kingdoms]], the Temple of Umberlee was erected in a shape of a pyramid. The structure was made out of black [[basalt]] and was reminiscent of a brooding spider to those accustomed to the Utter East architecture.

==Interior==
The main chamber of the temple was a grand domed hall, the public place of worship. The entrance doors were separated from it by a wide alcoved hallway. At the center of the domed hall stood the altar dedicated to Umberlee. Behind it stood a pedestal with a stature depicting the goddess. The hall's basalt walls had niches with more carved depictions of the Bitch Queen.

==History==
The temple was constructed by the [[Church of Umberlee]], one of the five churches that participated in the [[Ffolk]] colonization of the Utter East. As the faith of Umberly was one of the major religions in Doegan, her temple reflected it in its size. The [[True Believers]] were noticeable by their adorned [[robe]]s.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}},{{DDTS}} the city of Eldrinpar became consumed by a [[fiend]]ish invasion – the result of [[Artemis Entreri]]'s assassination of the Mage-Emperor of Doegan – [[Aetheric III]]. The assassin attempted to claim the ''[[bloodforge]]'' that belonged to Aetheric but he became overwhelmed by the invading demons. As a result, the ''bloodforge'' was claimed by the [[Fallen Temple]], depraved cannibalistic cult that devolved from the [[Church of Tyr]] in the Utter East. Using the chaos of invasion, the cultists slew the High Priest of the Temple of Umberlee as well as several other members of the clergy, desecrated statues of the goddess, and converted her altar into a ''bloodforge'' altar dedicated to [[Ysdar]]. The Fallen Temple attempted to perform the [[Rite of Investiture]] in order to summon the entity they venerated.

The ritual was stopped by the future emperor [[Ikavi Garkim]], young [[Waterdhavian]] nobleman [[Kastonoph Nesher]], a [[palading]] of Tyr [[Kern Desanea]], [[War Wizard]] [[Trandon]], and mercenary [[Sharessa Stagwood]]. In the process, the deity Tyr revealed himself through his new [[Chosen]] – blinded young pirate named [[Ingrar Welven]]. The deity manifested himself through ominous red skies and collapsed part of the temple's dome. Disgusted by the cult that claimed to be his worshipers, Tyr incinerated many, and forcing the survivors to flee.

Finally, the fiend invasion was culminated by reemergence of dying emperor Aetheric the Third. Driven mad by pain and the powers of a ''bloodforge'', the giant misshapen tentacled monstrosity of the emperor was slain at the gates of the temple.
