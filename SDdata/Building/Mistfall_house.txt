'''Mistfall House''' was an abandoned temple dedicated to [[Leira]] found in the village of [[Feather Falls (village)|Feather Falls]] in [[Featherdale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Description==
Once splendid, the temple sat empty in front of [[Feather Falls (waterfall)|Feather Falls]] on the [[River Ashaba]]. The interior was always damp courtesy of the mist from the waterfall. The temple contained six subterranean storage rooms, some of which connected to the [[Underdark]].

==Inhabitants==
The lower levels were home to several monsters despite efforts to clear them out.

==History==
During its prime, the temple appeared to have access to a variety of expensive wares that were transported to various Dales. The source of this wealth appeared to be from the Underdark, but it remained a mystery with whom the Leirans were trading with.
