Outside of the City of the Dead, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep, its exterior stood along Wall Way.\nThis tower stood four stories tall.\nBeing a torchtower, this structure had all the interior features that were common among them. This included a debriefing room, a small armory, holding cells, storage rooms for the holding of evidence or confiscated items, some bedchambers, and some garderobes.\nLike all other torchtowers, this structure had three beacon-fires that were constantly kept on standby.\nLike all torchtowers, this structure was manned by members of the City Watch. Four members of the Watch were always stationed inside of the tower, while one was posted outside to watch for any trouble in the nearby alleyways abutting the City of the Dead."
