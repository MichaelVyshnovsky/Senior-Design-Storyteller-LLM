The '''Iron Bull Smithy''' was blacksmith shop in [[Ravens Bluff]], during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], that specialized as the city's farrier. It was run by the siblings Smith, a brother and sister, whose work was of the utmost quality. They provided the finest [[horseshoe]]s, and took great care when shoeing their clients' steeds. 

==Location==
Originally located on [[Anvil Alley]] in the [[Holyhouses]] neighborhood, the Iron Bull was relocated to the corner of [[MacIntyre Path]] and [[Skulls Street]] within [[Swordspoint]] due to the construction of a temple.
