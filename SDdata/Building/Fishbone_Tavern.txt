'''Fishbone Tavern''' was a rough-and-tumble drinking establishment near [[Luskan]]'s [[Open Shore]] docks.

==Location==
The tavern was located a few blocks away from the Open Shore (an area of the [[Whitesails Harbor]]). It was close enough to smell the sea air and hear the [[sea gull]]s.

The building was easily recognized by the hanging sign above the door, which bore the establishment's name as well as a real, rotting [[fish]] that was [[nail]]ed to the board.

==Interior==
The inside was dark and cramped with only eight [[table]]s, each with [[stool]]s for sitting. The long, dark-stained wooden bar dominated one side of the room, with oval plaques bearing yellowed fish skeletons adorning the wall behind it. The wall opposite the bar had a small, smoky fireplace.

==Services==
The tavern catered to local laborers and fishers. It was also a popular haunt and thus a front for [[Dran Enterprises]].

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], every dockworker in Luskan was familiar with the Fishbone Tavern. 

By the {{Yearlink|1496}},{{AI-time}} both the owner, [[Fryer]], and bouncer, [[Zurb]], worked with Dran Enterprises. Fryer spied on her clientele on their behalf while Zurb kept their enemies out of the tavern. Members of Dran Enterprises frequented the tavern, while regulars who were not affiliated with that faction included [[Milo (fisher)|Milo]], [[Rakeem]], [[Tortuk]], and [[Velos]].
