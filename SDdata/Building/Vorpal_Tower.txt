The '''Vorpal Tower''' was a ruined tower in the [[Forest of Mir]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Location==
The Vorpal Tower stood 45 miles west of [[Magis Tor]] in the Forest of Mir, one mile north of the [[Marching Mountains]] and the settlement of [[Iskashyoll]].

==Structure==
The ruin was uninhabited and weathered by nature and time. Inside, one could only find [[lichen]]s and various plants.

==History==
When the tower was first discovered by a [[ranger]] from [[Survale Ford]], sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tower was already a ruin. It was distinctly damaged â€“ the tower was diagonally sliced in two, cleanly severing its two upper floors. The cut was what inspired the "Vorpal Tower" name.

By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the dungeons underneath the Vorpal Tower were used as a lair by the [[alhoon]] member of the [[Twisted Rune]] named [[Ralayn]] the Occultacle. The dungeon hid at east three ''[[gate]]s'' that led to the sinister organization's various rendezvous points.
