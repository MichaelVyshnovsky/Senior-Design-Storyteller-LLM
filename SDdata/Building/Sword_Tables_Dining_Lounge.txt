The '''Sword Tables Dining Lounge''' was a fine restaurant located on the ground floor of the [[Singing Sword Inn]] within the [[Temple District (Ravens Bluff)|Temple District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was a quiet eatery, that featured discreet booths and simple, but quite tasty, dishes served by an attendant and deft staff.

==Food & Drink==
The main attraction within the Sword Tables were a selection of [[soup]]s and [[stew]]s, but the they offered some of the more-commonly roasted meats and selection of [[beer]] and [[ale]]. The mixed-meat [[skewer]]s, which included [[boar]], [[lamb]], [[rabbit]] and [[quail]], each served with [[mustard]], [[gravy]] and/or [[mint]] jelly, were highly recommended among local Ravenians. Desserts included iced fruit and tasty cordials.
