        "mainbody": "he Drovers Last Drink was a unique tavern in Mosstone that lacked seating and provided drinks and snacks to arriving and departing caravaners while they waited for the wagons to be collected, readied, and outfitted for travel along the Trade Way.\nThe Drovers Last Drink was located just outside Mosstones gates to the Drovers Field on Rimmons Lane.\nThe Drink was a long and old dilapidated-looking building with a drooping roof. The structure was illuminated by the light of enchanted lanterns hanging from its rooftop that radiated insect-repelling magic. The bar did not have front walls, leaving it open to fresh air and ease of access for the customers on the road. The roof was held up at around  by the buildings extended porch.\nAnyone who peeked inside the tavern noticed its lack of amenities. The Drink had no furniture apart from two jakes at each side of the long bar and bolted down bar stools.\nThe tavern was always buzzing with clientele at all times of day and night. Dovers and travelers could be found inside waiting for their wagons to be outfitted and ready to travel. Some stopped for a refreshing drink after a long road on their way into Mosstone and to let the Drinks magic rid them of ticks, stinging ants, and other pests.\nOne might assume that the Drovers Last Drink could be flush with crime and conflict due to rough clientele frequenting it, but that could not be further from the truth. Such unpleasantness was almost unheard of at the Drink. Most clients were too tired from the road or caravan preparations to start trouble. Most of the clients were strong folks like drovers and sellswords who could easily stop a thief with a single punch or an expertly-thrown sturdy tankard. And the final reason for the peaceful atmosphere was the fact that the constable of Mosstone often stopped at the Drink to check on the arrival and departures.\nThe Drovers Last Drink offered good quality affordable libations as well as several types of handpies. The Drink was beloved for its portable foods. Three small pies went for a single copper coin, a single large pie was priced the same, at one copper. Dovers who departed Mosstone ordered a handful of smallpies to take on the road, while the ones who had time perched themselves on a barstool and were served a full-sized pie served in a bowl.\nThe variety of pies was notable. The Drovers Last Drink served chicken pies, pheasant pies, and quail pies, wrapped in the perfect golden crust and filled to the brim with deeply colored brown mushroom gravy that burst out once pies were cut into. Among sweet treats, the Drink had rhubarb and many-berry tarts, sold seven per copper piece. Similarly priced were delectable tamarind balls. The Calimshan and Tashalar-influenced sweet and sour pastry was ball-shaped, fried, then dusted with sugar.\nNewcomers to the Drovers Last Drink were often told a story of a human finger found in one of their large pies in some years past."
