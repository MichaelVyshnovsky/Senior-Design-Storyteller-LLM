The Whispering Witch was a dark yet cozy inn located in Tilverton in the 14 century DR.
The Witch was in the Old Town of Tilverton at the end of Haddock Row, off the Street of the Sorceress not far from the Market Stairs.
The inn was named for the unexplained sounds and spells that were often heard behind its closed doors.
The Witch was owned and operated by two sisters â€“ the mages Aluana and Jhansabella Nithrin. Both of the sisters, as well as the cook and stablemaster were secret agents of the Harpers.
