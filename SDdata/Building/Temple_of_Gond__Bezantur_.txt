This '''temple of Gond''' was the [[Church of Gond]]'s central temple within the nation of [[Thay]].

==Location==
This temple stood in the city of [[Bezantur]], situated near the [[Temple of Leira (Bezantur)|Temple of Leira]] and [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Temple of Tyr]].

==Structure==
This temple was a large structure of [[iron]] plates held together by large exposed [[rivet]]s. It had mechanical gates that clanked, as well as numerous chimneys and vents from which steam and strange smoke periodically bellowed out.

The temple as a whole was protected by a variety of [[trap]]s.

==Inhabitants==
Twenty [[priest]]s lived within this temple, all armed with [[Lantan]]na [[arquebus]]es.

==Reputation==
Due to very few people in Bezantur actively worshiping Gond, the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] speculated that this temple could merely be a spying station for the Church of Gond.

==Rumors & Legends==
This temple was rumored to be protected by clockwork automatons, ones that were allegedly so deadly that they could slay legions of [[warrior]]s.
