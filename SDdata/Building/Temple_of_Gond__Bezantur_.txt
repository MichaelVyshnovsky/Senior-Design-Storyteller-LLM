This temple of Gond was the Church of Gonds central temple within the nation of Thay.
This temple stood in the city of Bezantur, situated near the Temple of Leira and Temple of Tyr.
This temple was a large structure of iron plates held together by large exposed rivets. It had mechanical gates that clanked, as well as numerous chimneys and vents from which steam and strange smoke periodically bellowed out.
The temple as a whole was protected by a variety of traps.
Twenty priests lived within this temple, all armed with Lantanna arquebuses.
Due to very few people in Bezantur actively worshiping Gond, the Red Wizards of Thay speculated that this temple could merely be a spying station for the Church of Gond.
This temple was rumored to be protected by clockwork automatons, ones that were allegedly so deadly that they could slay legions of warriors.
