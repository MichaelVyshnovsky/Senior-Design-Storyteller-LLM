The '''Hall of the Ancients''' was a large tomb complex in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of [[Evermeet]] that was used to house the remains of [[elf|elven]] heroes.

==Description==
An extensive complex, it comprised long and echoing chambers joining countless crypts and shrines and filled with plaques and statues of deceased heroes of the elves. Among them, it contained the bodies of [[Lafarallinn]] and [[Kethryllia Amarillis]].

==Defenses==
The hall was protected both by magical wards and elven warriors.

==Rumors & Legends==
A rumor existed that the Hall of the Ancients also housed renowned elven [[magical item]]s and weaponry, though the rumor did not give specifics of these and the elves did not share any details with outsiders. [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and other experts believed this to be false, for the elves, unlike [[dwarves]], did not make a habit of locking away useful magical devices and would rather use them to protect the still-living.
