        "mainbody": "'''Undreir Facilitations''' was a second-hand shop and fence in [[Tilverton]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], operated by the unscrupulous merchant [[Phidalpar Undreir]].",
        "Location": "The shop sat in the southern edge of the Old Town of Tilverton on a side lane just off of [[Gateguard Road]], opposite the new location of the [[Windlord's Rest]].",
        "Defenses": "Phidalpar was not a member of the [[Rogues of Tilverton]], and protected himself and his business with a dozen or more guards on-hand armed with sleep-[[poison]]ed [[dart]]s and [[dagger]]s in case of trouble.",
        "Services": "Undreir Facilitations bought and sold all manner of goods, regardless of how questionable their origin or purpose. Phidalpar was always willing to take care of \"awkward\" items that [[adventurer]]s brought him, and offered them \"simple, little jobs\" that needed taking care of."
