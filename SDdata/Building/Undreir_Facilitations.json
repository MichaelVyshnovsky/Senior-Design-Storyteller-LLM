        "mainbody": "Undreir Facilitations was a second-hand shop and fence in Tilverton in the 14 century DR, operated by the unscrupulous merchant Phidalpar Undreir.\nThe shop sat in the southern edge of the Old Town of Tilverton on a side lane just off of Gateguard Road, opposite the new location of the Windlords Rest.\nPhidalpar was not a member of the Rogues of Tilverton, and protected himself and his business with a dozen or more guards on-hand armed with sleep-poisoned darts and daggers in case of trouble.\nUndreir Facilitations bought and sold all manner of goods, regardless of how questionable their origin or purpose. Phidalpar was always willing to take care of \"awkward\" items that adventurers brought him, and offered them \"simple, little jobs\" that needed taking care of."
