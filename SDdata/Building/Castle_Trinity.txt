'''Castle Trinity''' was the headquarters of a sect worshiping the goddess [[Talona]]. It was located in the [[Snowflake Mountains]] of [[Erlkazar]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Architecture==
Located high in the Snowflake Mountains and mainly built underground, Castle Trinity was shaped to look like a rocky outcropping,

==Inhabitants==
The castle was ruled by a triumvirate comprising the leaders of the orders of [[wizard]]s, [[cleric]]s, and [[warrior]]s in the castle.

[[Barjin]], a [[cleric]], was head of the clerical order as well as of the triumvirate. When Barjin died, Aballister Bonaduce took over the leadership.

Aballister Bonaduce was the head of the wizards. Another notable member was the mage [[Dorigen]].

The [[ogrillon]] [[Ragnor]] was the leader of the sect's warriors
