        "mainbody": "'''Candulhallow's Funeral Arrangements''', also referred to as '''Candulhallow's Tombstones''', was a city-sponsored business in [[Baldur's Gate]] that specialized in the transportation and occasionally sale of corpses to cemeteries or temples. It also aided in some smuggling endeavors and occasionally sold bodies to certain Baldurian enterprises.\n\n{{quote|''Remembering the deceased with sympathy and skill.''|A signboard outside.}}",
        "Location": "[[File:Heapside.jpg|thumb|''A map showing the location of Candulhallow's.''|360x360px]]\nThe business was located on the southern region of [[Heapside]], in the [[Lower City]] of Baldur's Gate.",
        "Staff": "As the name suggested, the business was run by the [[moon elf]] Candulhallow family and their staff of porters. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was led by the family matriarch, [[Leylenna Candulhallow|Leylenna]].",
        "Services": "Candulhallow's employed a small fleet of [[wagon]]s and [[hand cart]]s to haul recently deceased individuals from their location of passing to graveyards outside the city or, sometimes, the [[Shrine of the Suffering]] a few streets north. They received regular compensation from city officials and were regularly tipped by those who grieved the deaths of their \"clientele.\" Candulhallow's Tombstones also offered etching and engraving custom headstone for the recently deceased. Premium edition headstones were decorated with more complex and more expensive engraving of iconography.\n\nAdditionally, the family operated a discreet smuggling operation for [[the Guild]]. They often transported illicit goods within bundles dressed to look like bodies covered in burial shrouds while selling the actual corpses to cult members and [[necromancer]]s. These crimes against the Baldurian dead were not well known among the city's populace.",
        "History": "At some point in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Leylenna Candulhallow began to steal the freshest, least-desecrated cadavers for her own personal experiments. The shop also hid an entrance to a secret [[Bhaalist]] cabalâ€“the [[Murder Tribunal]] underneath the city. The door was hidden behind a cupboard that moved with a press of a button. The entrance was hidden at the very back of the worship behind the ''[[Butterfly on Skull]]'' painting. The door itself was marked and ensorcelled only to open to an utterance of the password \"Sicarius.\"\n\nAs of [[1492 DR]], Candulhallow's clients ordered tombstones for [[Fridrik Hhune]], [[Franc Peartree]], [[May Winfield]], [[Varri Vanthampur]], [[Reynald]], and [[Alexander Rainforest]] among others.\n\nUnder the control of the Murder Tribunal, or \"the Management,\" Candulhallow's was hardly much of a business. \"The Management\" ordered clerk [[Dravidge]] to keep all prices very high so only a bare minimum of the stock got sold."
