        "mainbody": "Candulhallows Funeral Arrangements, also referred to as Candulhallows Tombstones, was a city-sponsored business in Baldurs Gate that specialized in the transportation and occasionally sale of corpses to cemeteries or temples. It also aided in some smuggling endeavors and occasionally sold bodies to certain Baldurian enterprises.\nthumb|A map showing the location of Candulhallows.|360x360px\nThe business was located on the southern region of Heapside, in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate.\nAs the name suggested, the business was run by the moon elf Candulhallow family and their staff of porters. As of the late 15 century DR, it was led by the family matriarch, Leylenna.\nCandulhallows employed a small fleet of wagons and hand carts to haul recently deceased individuals from their location of passing to graveyards outside the city or, sometimes, the Shrine of the Suffering a few streets north. They received regular compensation from city officials and were regularly tipped by those who grieved the deaths of their \"clientele.\" Candulhallows Tombstones also offered etching and engraving custom headstone for the recently deceased. Premium edition headstones were decorated with more complex and more expensive engraving of iconography.\nAdditionally, the family operated a discreet smuggling operation for the Guild. They often transported illicit goods within bundles dressed to look like bodies covered in burial shrouds while selling the actual corpses to cult members and necromancers. These crimes against the Baldurian dead were not well known among the citys populace.\nAt some point in the , Leylenna Candulhallow began to steal the freshest, least-desecrated cadavers for her own personal experiments. The shop also hid an entrance to a secret Bhaalist cabalâ€“the Murder Tribunal underneath the city. The door was hidden behind a cupboard that moved with a press of a button. The entrance was hidden at the very back of the worship behind the Butterfly on Skull painting. The door itself was marked and ensorcelled only to open to an utterance of the password \"Sicarius.\"\nAs of 1492 DR, Candulhallows clients ordered tombstones for Fridrik Hhune, Franc Peartree, May Winfield, Varri Vanthampur, Reynald, and Alexander Rainforest among others.\nUnder the control of the Murder Tribunal, or \"the Management,\" Candulhallows was hardly much of a business. \"The Management\" ordered clerk Dravidge to keep all prices very high so only a bare minimum of the stock got sold."
