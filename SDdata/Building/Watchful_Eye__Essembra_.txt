The Watchful Eye was an inn in Essembra around 1368 DR.
The building was a huge and half-timbered converted manor house.
The inside of the Eye was a well furnished comfortable looking establishment with good rooms, as Volothamp Geddarm stated in Volos Guide to the Dalelands, "a trifle sparsely and simply decorated".
The Watchful Eye of Essembria was a relaxing establishment, but was famous for its kitchen.
The owner of the Watchful Eye was Chesduk Malrit and his three daughters, Aleesha Malrit, Baernysse Malrit, and Lathyleea Malrit.
The inn served served wonderful meat pies.
