The '''Iron Keep''' was a fortress located on [[Oman's Isle]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
The keep was located along the [[Iron Bay]] on the north side of the island.

==Inhabitants==
[[Thelgaar Ironhand]], a Jarl of [[Oman]] during the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ruled from the Iron Keep. After his death, Oman's Isle was overrun and ruled by [[giant]]s from the [[Grampalt Highlands]] and [[fomorian]]s of [[Vor Thomil]]. An [[ettin]] named [[Hathfell]] was tasked with keeping the Iron Keep out of enemy hands.{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}

==History==
The Iron Keep was the ancestral seat of power for the [[Northlander]] rulers of Oman. The structure was built on the foundation of a [[Ffolk]] castle. Much of the fortress was ruined when the giants took control of Oman's Isle.
