The Black Pits was a famous Underdark fighting pit in the 1300s DR, operated by the powerful drow sorcerer Baeloth Barrityl.
The Black Pits was located on an island somewhere in the Underdark. It was used to pit adventurers against monsters and other adventuring groups. When the contestants had won fifteen battles, they would fight the pit master themselves.

The structure was originally dug out by duergar. When Baeloth Barrityl seized control of the area, he enslaved the original builders and established the Black Pits as a fighting pit. When Baeloth was slain by the Champion of Baeloths Pits, the duergar reclaimed the area.
