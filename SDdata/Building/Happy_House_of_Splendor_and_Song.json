It was the biggest temple to Milil on the eastern side of the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe Happy House of Splendor and Song lay on the east side of the city.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the deity Torm resided at his temple in Tantras. Torms zealous priests began persecuting followers of other faiths in the city as \"unbelievers\". It is not known if or how the Happy House was affected by this religious persecution.\nNevertheless, the Happy House remained active through to 1367 DR and past 1370 DR.\nThe temple of Milil provided support and guidance to local members of the Harpers. The temple was considered by some to be a place to contact Those Who Harp.\nIn 1358 DR, the temple was led by High Mistress of Song Elassuara Narithan, with six priests and eleven lay-followers. These followers were all low- to mid-range bards."
