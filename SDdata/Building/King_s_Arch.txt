The Kings Arch was a famous and important bridge in Amn.
The bridge crossed the River Esmel with the South Road, halfway between Gambiton and Esmeltaran.
The bridge was made of solid stone in a simple design.
The bridge was built early in the reign of King Esmel Torlath I in the 5 century DR as part of the infrastructure development of the kingdom of Amn.
By the 14 century DR the bridge was in mild disrepair, and the flagstones needed replacing.
