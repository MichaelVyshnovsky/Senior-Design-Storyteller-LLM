        "mainbody": "The '''Sewer Keep''' was a tower complex located in the [[Seatower]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]]. While it was originally used to deal with the city's massive waste and sewage problem, by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] it had become a haven for a specialized band of thieves.",
        "Activities": "The civic facility was used to treat and purify the solid waste that left [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|the city's sewer system]] and emptied out into the [[River Chionthar]]. This was accomplished by several holding tanks, combined with flora that were [[magic]]ally altered to cleanse the sewage. Solids settled at the bottom of these holding tanks, where they eventually (after being treated & purified) were rodded or pumped out of the tanks and then carted away upriver to be spread upon agricultural fields as fertilizer.",
        "History": "Sewer Keep was part of a widescale update to the sewage system of Baldur's Gate that the [[Church of Gond]] had devised some years prior to [[1368 DR]] in order to confront the serious health issues that were arising from flaws in the then-current system.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-25 - Sewers of Baldur's Gate}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Year\">This had to have occurred prior to 1368 DR, the date in which the game [[Baldur's Gate (game)|''Baldur's Gate'']] takes place, since that game depicts the city's sewers with the updates that were conceived of by the Church of Gond. Its ultimate founding was a significant feat, accomplished by a partnership of [[druid]]s, civic engineers and wealthy Baldurian [[patriar]].\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{BG-DiA-time}} the facility had largely been taken over by [[Genamine Kopali]] and the [[Sewerkeepers]] crew."
