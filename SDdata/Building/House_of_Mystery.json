        "mainbody": "The House of Mystery, also known as the Reign of Night, was the largest temple to Shar and her most important holy site during the time of the Netherese Empire.\nThe temple was located in the logging port of Sepulcher, in the cold north of Low Netheril.\nThe House of Mystery was a vast, many-storied complex of odd exterior design.\nThe interior of the temple was equally confusing. So full it was with passageways, secret doors, hidden chambers, mysterious locking mechanisms, bizarre stairwells, and plunging drop chutes that even its own clerics often got lost or confused.\nThe temple was constructed sometime between around  and , when followers of Shar secretly and slowly migrated to the vicinity of Sepulcher. They did so in number because of the darkness of the northern latitudes in the winter and because the town was so remote, leaving them free from persecution to pursue their dark religion. The pilgrims built the temple in honor of their goddess.\nThe shade cleric Variance Amatick believed that among the treasures of the House of Mystery were The Leaves of One Night, a document that Shar believed so dangerous to her well-being that she cursed it to make it unreadable.\nThis could not have been possible, however, for the town of Sepulcher—and the entire empire of Netheril—fell long before the The Leaves of One Night were ever written.\nShar chose the high priestess of the House of Mystery to be the head of her entire faith, though with the remoteness of the temple, not all of the Church was aware of this fact."
