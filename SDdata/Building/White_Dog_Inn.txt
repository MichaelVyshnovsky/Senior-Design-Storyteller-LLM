The '''White Dog Inn''' was an inn in the [[T'u Lung]] city of [[Balanzia]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2310|SY}}.

==Location==
This inn was located in the southern portion of Balanzia, down the road from the homes and warehouse that were owned by a man named [[Xu]].

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|2403|SY}}, the White Dog was one of many buildings that were left intact in Balanzia as the city fell at the hands of the [[Shou Lung]] invasion of T'u Lung.The White Dog Inn is not explicitly stated in text to have not been destroyed in the incident that destroyed the city. However, on the "before-and-after" maps of Balanzia in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' the building is still present on the "after" version. Therefore, it can be inferred that it was likely not destroyed. Centuries later, around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, the building that once housed the White Dog Inn still stood within the abandoned cityand was recorded as such on a [[map]] made of the city in that year.<ref group="note" name="Year" />
