The Drum Tower was the main alarm system for the city of Manass in Khazari in 1367 DR.
Found in the center of the city near the Boylas Court, the Drum Tower sported red beams, a black-tiled roof, and shining brass fittings. The tower stood three stories high. A large drum hung from rafters at the top of the tower.
The drum tower was used to rouse the militia, served as a fire alarm, and announced special proclamations occurring in the courtyard below. The Master of the Drum lived in quarters found at the base of the tower.
