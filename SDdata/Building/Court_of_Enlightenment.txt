The Court of Enlightenment, or the first court, was part of the complex of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
This large court faced the Golden Mosque. Elaborate decorative tiles of red and blue covered many of the surfaces. When viewed from the upper levels these tiles formed an outline of the Golden Mosque.
The massive area in front of the Court could easily hold 50,000 people at one time.
The Grand Caliph would address his people on his Ascension Day from the Pavilion of the Enlightened Throne found within the Court.
The red and blue tiles used to depict past Grand Caliphs, but Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir had the tiles rearranged to show the Golden Mosque and demonstrate his devotion to the Enlightened Gods.
