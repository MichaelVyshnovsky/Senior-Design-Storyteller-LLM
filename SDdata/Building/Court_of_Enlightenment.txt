The '''Court of Enlightenment''', or the '''first court''', was part of the complex of the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
This large court faced the [[Golden Mosque]]. Elaborate decorative tiles of red and blue covered many of the surfaces. When viewed from the upper levels these tiles formed an outline of the Golden Mosque.

The massive area in front of the Court could easily hold 50,000 people at one time.

==Activities==
The Grand Caliph would address his people on his [[Ascension Day]] from the [[Pavilion of the Enlightened Throne]] found within the Court.

==History==
The red and blue tiles used to depict past [[Grand Caliph]]s, but [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]] had the tiles rearranged to show the Golden Mosque and demonstrate his devotion to the [[Zakharan pantheon|Enlightened Gods]].
