'''Halamor's Tower''' was a residential building that had been converted to offices and workshops, located in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

==Location==
Halamor's Tower was located on the northwest side [[Orntathtar Way]] just past [[Darrusktraal]], the duty-house for the Dubrinlar gate (the western gate through the walls surrounding Khôltar). An alley separated Darrusktraal from Halamor's Tower. Next door was [[Hindror House]] and across the street was [[Malgart House]], the seat of the judiciary in the Iron City.

==Structure==
This tower was known as a "fist" in local parlance, meaning that it was a medium-sized building compared to others in the city. The outer walls of stone were carved in relief with images of various hammers, anvils, and wagon wheels, all amidst a shower of hundreds of coins.

==Interior==
The floors of this former residence were converted to office and workshop space. It was occupied by at least forty workers.

==Services==
Rooms and floors of this tower were rented out to various finecrafters&mdash;laborers and artisans that finished, assembled and polished small items like hinges, doorknobs, and locks&mdash;either individuals, guilds, or businesses.

==History==
A human named [[Halamor]] once owned this fist and dwelled in it. He eventually decided to rent out some of his extra space to finecrafters and was quite successful. He left a large fortune to his heirs when he passed away.
