Halamor
Halamors Tower was a residential building that had been converted to offices and workshops, located in Khôltar, south Faerûn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Halamors Tower was located on the northwest side Orntathtar Way just past Darrusktraal, the duty-house for the Dubrinlar gate (the western gate through the walls surrounding Khôltar). An alley separated Darrusktraal from Halamors Tower. Next door was Hindror House and across the street was Malgart House, the seat of the judiciary in the Iron City.
This tower was known as a "fist" in local parlance, meaning that it was a medium-sized building compared to others in the city. The outer walls of stone were carved in relief with images of various hammers, anvils, and wagon wheels, all amidst a shower of hundreds of coins.
The floors of this former residence were converted to office and workshop space. It was occupied by at least forty workers.
Rooms and floors of this tower were rented out to various finecrafters&mdashlaborers and artisans that finished, assembled and polished small items like hinges, doorknobs, and locks&mdasheither individuals, guilds, or businesses.
A human named Halamor once owned this fist and dwelled in it. He eventually decided to rent out some of his extra space to finecrafters and was quite successful. He left a large fortune to his heirs when he passed away.
