        "Description": "Along with the [[Tower of Harmony]] atop the summit, a vast network of twelve tunnels within Mount Kus comprised this temple to [[Bimasara]]. The tunnels spiraled upward through the mountain from its base, emerging halfway up the slopes. Six roads from these tunnels continued up the mountain to the Tower of Harmony.",
        "Inhabitants": "Priests of Bimasara underwent dangerous tests within the tunnel to prove their worth.\n\nThe tunnels were abandoned for a long time since the destruction of Kushk during the [[War of the Purple Dragon]].\n\nSinister [[gaki]] took up residence within the tunnels after Kushk was sacked."
