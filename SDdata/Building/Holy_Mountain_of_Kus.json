The tunnels spiraled upward through the mountain from its base, emerging halfway up the slopes. Six roads from these tunnels continued up the mountain to the Tower of Harmony.\nPriests of Bimasara underwent dangerous tests within the tunnel to prove their worth.\nThe tunnels were abandoned for a long time since the destruction of Kushk during the War of the Purple Dragon.\nSinister gaki took up residence within the tunnels after Kushk was sacked."
