The Towers of the Vengeful Hand was a temple complex devoted to Tempus and located in the center of Eshpurta in Amn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The temple stood in the very center of the city.
As of 1367 DR, there were ten underpriests serving about 150 adherents and a large number of worshipers among the 28,000 garrisoned troops, instructors, trainees, and support personnel of Eshpurta.
As of 1370 DR, high priest Trusted Sword Jak Errins was getting on in years and two of his underpriests, Battlelady Peris Whallnsor and Lance of the Sword Niskam Tresdaap, were vying for the politically powerful leadership position.
