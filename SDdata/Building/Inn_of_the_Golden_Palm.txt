The '''Inn of the Golden Palm''' was an inn in [[Bralizzar]] in the [[Dustwall Mountains]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|16}}

==Location==
The Inn of the Golden Palm was at the intersection of the Boulevard and the Bazaar, opposite the latter.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|17}}

==Structure==
The inn was a building of brilliant white stone, with crossed palms growing in stone tubs to provide shade on the entrance; it had once been a temple, but a sign had been added when it was turned into an inn. The inside had a single common area with a stage.

==Staff==
[[Tekuna Chand]] was the proprietor.

==Services==
The [[House of Mirth]] was of middling quality between it and the [[Swayback Camel]]; given the latter's description, the Inn of the Golden Palm probably compared favorably to the others.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|18}} Its stage could be used for singing and dancing.
