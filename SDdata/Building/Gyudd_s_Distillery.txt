'''Gyudd's Distillery''' was a business located within the subterranean city of [[Skullport]] that specialized in the creation of certain spirits. It was run by the [[shield dwarf]] [[Gyudd]], after whom it was named.

The establishment could be found within the lowest level of the city, known as [[Dredge|the Dredge]] and was so tall that it extended beyond [[Venter|the Venter]].

==Services==
As of the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]], the distillery produced ''[[Goat's Head ale]]'', a sherry called ''[[Amberjack]]'', and the absolutely disgusting beverage known as ''[[Wyrmwizz]]''.

===Prices===
The different spirits were available in [[cask]]s of {{SI|5|gallon|l|long=yes}}. The prices were as follows:
* [[Amberjack]]: 20 [[gp]]
* [[Goat's Head ale]]: 10 gp
* [[Wyrmwizz]]: 5 gp
