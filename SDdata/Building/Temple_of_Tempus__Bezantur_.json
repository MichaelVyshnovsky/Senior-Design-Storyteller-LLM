        "mainbody": "The Temple of Tempus in Bezantur, Thay was a place of worship dedicated to Tempus, a god who was popular with the locals owing to his association with unrestrained violence.\nThe temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". Its immediate neighbors included the Temple of Sune to the west, the House of Cyric and the Temple of Bane to the north, the Temple of Tyr to the east, and the temples of Leira and Myrkul to the south.\nThe temple itself was a fortress of granite with the symbol of Tempus&mdasha fiery sword on a red field&mdashdisplayed prominently above the main gate. This gate was constructed of iron and was flanked by two enormous statues of Tempus the statue on the right depicted him astride his black steed Deiros while the one on the left rode his white steed Veiros.\nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Tempus remained a popular deity in Bezantur despite the fact that the church of Tempus was often at odds with the Red Wizards of Thay. The churchs representative at the Temple during this time was Priest-Captain Zeidero."
