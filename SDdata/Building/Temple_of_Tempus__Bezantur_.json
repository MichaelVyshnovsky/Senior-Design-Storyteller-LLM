        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Tempus''' in [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]] was a place of worship dedicated to [[Tempus]], a [[god]] who was popular with the locals owing to his association with unrestrained violence.",
        "Location": "The temple was located in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples\". Its immediate neighbors included the [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Temple of Sune]] to the west, the [[House of Cyric (Bezantur)|House of Cyric]] and the [[Temple of Bane (Bezantur)|Temple of Bane]] to the north, the [[Temple of Tyr (Bezantur)|Temple of Tyr]] to the east, and the temples of [[Temple of Leira (Bezantur)|Leira]] and [[Temple of Myrkul (Bezantur)|Myrkul]] to the south.",
        "Structure": "The temple itself was a fortress of [[granite]] with the symbol of Tempus&mdash;a fiery [[sword]] on a red field&mdash;displayed prominently above the main gate. This gate was constructed of [[iron]] and was flanked by two enormous statues of Tempus: the statue on the right depicted him astride his black steed [[Deiros]] while the one on the left rode his white steed [[Veiros]].",
        "History": "As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Tempus remained a popular deity in Bezantur despite the fact that the [[church of Tempus]] was often at odds with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. The church's representative at the Temple during this time was Priest-Captain [[Zeidero]]."
