'''The Bridge and Bow''' was an alehouse located in the city of [[Archenbridge]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was known for its peace and quiet.

==Location==
The shop was located on the northern part of town, well hidden down a side alley off [[Pelter's Street]].

==Structure==
The Bow was had two floors: a taproom on the first floor, and a meeting room above it. The latter was well suited for private meetings: it had thick tapestries and double walls keeping the noise from being heard outside, as well as a secret ladder in a closet that allowed access to the cellars and from there to the [[Archenbridge sewers|sewers]].

==Services==
Customers at the Bow could get served a varied selection of drinks such as [[ale]]s, stouts, and [[sherries]]. One could also get a light meal there, such as [[salted fish]], [[sausage]], [[cheese]], and buttered [[bread]]â€”for 5 [[gp]] a [[platter]].

The ''house special'' was called a "Liggins," and consisted of all of the menu items cooked together and served on a slab of hot bread with cheese holding everything together. It was named after a former proprietor.

The meeting room could be rented for the sum of 25 [[gp]] for an evening, a price which included some drinks for the guests.
