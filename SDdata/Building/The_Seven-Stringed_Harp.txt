The Seven-Stringed Harp was a ramshackle tavern that lay beside a pond in the lowest part of Secomber around 1366 DR.
On the exterior, this sprawling tavern looked like a jumbled mess of many wings, varying styles of roof, and small domes from which one could look out. There was a large hitching post outside to accommodate its many traveling clients. Floating above this was an intangible, glowing harp, which had been fabricated by Amelior Amanitas through use of a permanent spell.
The interior of the Harp was just as chaotic as the exterior. It was a cramped space with low-lying ceilings, full of odd corners, passages, and alcoves that one could easily get lost in. These many halls were dimly lit by wandering, blue driftglobes.
Branching out from the central taproom was a complex series of passages, hidden by tapestries, intended for use by the employees.
All the furniture and tapestries in the building were old and similarly eclectic, salvaged from over fifty dilapidated Waterdhavian villas.
The Harp used to be called the Stag, which lacked the popularity it later held. Around 1326 DR, it was visited one night by a half-elf bard named Talanthe Truesilver, who performed a new composition called The Ballad of the Dream Weaver. This song would grow to garner widespread acclaim across Faerûn and in turn the tavern it was first played in became widely known. Eventually the Stag took advantage of this newfound reputation and adopted its new name, the Seven-Stringed Harp.
This tavern was well known for serving many traveling minstrels and bards, who came from all across west and northwest Faerûn because of its ties to the famous Dream Weaver ballad. This pilgrimage for musicians was so common that a tradition of performing there free of charge developed. But beyond this traveling clientele the tavern was a popular destination for local townsmen as well as merchants seeking to conduct business.
