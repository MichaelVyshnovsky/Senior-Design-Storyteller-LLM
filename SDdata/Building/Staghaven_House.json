        "mainbody": "taghaven House was the residence of the Windstag noble family in Suzail in the late 15 century DR.\nThe manor was close to a tower on the north end of Suzail.\nThe front parlor had a long table, which was used for drinking.\nThe grounds were walled. A secret tunnel connected Staghaven Houses grounds with their luxury stables.\nIn the aftermath of the Council of the Dragon and ensuing massacre on late Mirtul of the , Broryn Windstag, who had remained at home for the event, had Irlin Stonestable as a guest when his servant Aereld informed him of the chaos in the wake of the killing. Though he felt it may have been exaggerated, a soon-arriving Sacrast Handragon confirmed Aereld and explained the situation was even more dire.\nOther guests arriving in that day included Traevyn Illance, who came to recruit the heirs into a plot to mind-control the King Osbur, with a warning for the young Windstag, and a desperate Marlin Stormserpent, fearing an unknown mind-controller, actually the vampire archmage Manshoon. Illance and Marlin plotted for a way to leverage Marlin Stormserpents blueflame ghosts to gain the Kings trust.\nLord Windstag and all his servants were murdered shortly after by an unknown, sorcerous assailant, who cast a spell on the corpses that drove insane anyone who used magic to interrogate them.\n* Broryn Windstag"
