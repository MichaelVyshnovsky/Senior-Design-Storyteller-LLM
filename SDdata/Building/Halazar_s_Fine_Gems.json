        "mainbody": "Halazars Fine Gems was a jewelry shop in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe shop was located on the west side of Shield Street, in the block between Hassantyrs Street and Julthoon Street.\nThis shop stood two stories tall. The front of the store was a glistening black surface, kept pristine by the use of magic. An illusory gemstone the size of a humans head decorated the central part of the façade. Touching the illusion drained a very small portion of a creatures life energy, which was then converted to maintain the illusion.\nThe finest gems could be found in the shop, expertly cut and presented in simple glass cases. Each gem was sold for four times the typical market value. This steep price was not an issue for the shops operation, as the nobility of Waterdeep enjoyed boasting how much they could afford to spend.\nThe exact security measures employed by Halazars Fine Gems were unclear.\nThere were not entirely unfounded rumors that gargoyles worked security at the shop.\nBy the mid‒14 century DR, the shop was owned by Stromquil Halazar, Guildmaster of Waterdeeps Jewelers Guild. He was known by his sneering posture and soft voice, as well as his watchful eyes."
