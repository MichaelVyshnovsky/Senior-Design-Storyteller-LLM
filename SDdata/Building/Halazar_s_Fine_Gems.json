        "mainbody": "'''Halazar's Fine Gems''' was a jewelry shop in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Location": "The shop was located on the west side of [[Shield Street]], in the block between [[Hassantyr's Street]] and [[Julthoon Street]].",
        "Structure": "This shop stood two stories tall. The front of the store was a glistening black surface, kept pristine by the use of [[magic]]. An [[illusion|illusory]] gemstone the size of a [[human]]'s head decorated the central part of the façade. Touching the illusion drained a very small portion of a creature's life energy, which was then converted to maintain the illusion.",
        "Services": "The finest [[gem]]s could be found in the shop, expertly cut and presented in simple glass cases. Each gem was sold for four times the typical market value. This steep price was not an issue for the shop's operation, as the [[nobility of Waterdeep]] enjoyed boasting how much they could afford to spend.",
        "Defenses": "The exact security measures employed by Halazar's Fine Gems were unclear.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were not entirely unfounded rumors that [[gargoyle]]s worked security at the shop.",
        "Inhabitants": "By the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], the shop was owned by [[Stromquil Halazar]], Guildmaster of Waterdeep's [[Jewelers' Guild]]. He was known by his sneering posture and soft voice, as well as his watchful eyes."
