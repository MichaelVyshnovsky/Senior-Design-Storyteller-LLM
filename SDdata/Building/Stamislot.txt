Stamislot was a keep in Amn that once belonged to Baron Relve Stamislothar, sometime before the late 14 century DR.
The keep stood in the rolling wilderlands to the northwest from the most northwestern end of the Snowflake Mountains.
At some point before the late 14 century DR, the keep was run by the infamous "robber baron" Relve Stamislothar, the strongholds namesake. With time, the keep came to be nothing more than abandoned ruins.
In the 14 century DR, Stamislot was home of the Two-Headed Wyvern of Stamislot. The strange beast was slain by the mercenary and adventuring duo of Talarenne and the person who would later become known as the Hero of Daggerford. The friends battled the dreaded wyvern under the cover of the night during a storm. At one point, Talarenne pulled the Hero of Daggerford out of the creatures maw but missed the second head that bit Tala on her backside. Eventually, it was slain. The deed was done sometime before the .
The ruins of Stamislot still stood as of the late 15 century DR.
