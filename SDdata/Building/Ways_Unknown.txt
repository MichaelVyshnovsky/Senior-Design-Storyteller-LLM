'''Ways Unknown''' was a wilderness guide business that operated out of the [[Uptown District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was run by the excitable, but experienced, [[half-elven]] outdoorsman [[Eryn Lashir]].

The business was headquartered in a short, thatched-roof building located on [[Manycoins Way]] in the city's [[Torchtown]] neighborhood.
