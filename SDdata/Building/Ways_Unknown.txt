Ways Unknown was a wilderness guide business that operated out of the Uptown District of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 century DR. It was run by the excitable, but experienced, half-elven outdoorsman Eryn Lashir.
The business was headquartered in a short, thatched-roof building located on Manycoins Way in the citys Torchtown neighborhood.
