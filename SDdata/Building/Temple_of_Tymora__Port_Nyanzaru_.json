        "mainbody": "he Temple of Tymora in Port Nyanzaru, Chult was a place of worship dedicated to Tymora, the goddess of good fortune.\nThe temple lay on the floor of the ravine that defined the slum district of Malars Throat.\nIt was a sturdy and fortified structure of heavy stone that emphasized safety over elegance.\nThe temple was known to reward those who protected or served the people of Malars Throat, such as with gifts of tej or healing potions.\nWhenever Malars Throat came under attack from undead or flooded during heavy rains, the Temple of Tymora served as a safe refuge for those who were not able to flee the ravine.\nIn the century following the disappearance of Ubtao, Tymora became one of the more popular Faer√ªnian gods among the people of Port Nyanzaru, and the poor folk of Malars Throat came to ascribe what little luck they had in life to her. By the late 15 century DR, foreign preachers were no longer widely welcome in the city owing to a history of exploitation, and so the Tymoran priesthood had come to be composed of native Chultans."
