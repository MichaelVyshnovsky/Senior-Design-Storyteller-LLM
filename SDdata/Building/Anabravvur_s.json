        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Anabravvur's shipbuilders were run by [[Alpharra Anabravvur]], the third generation of her family to helm the business. Alpharra's ships were huge and luxurious, elegantly designed out of superb materials. Anabravvur's received a lot of business but could afford to spend time on building, unaffected financially by the loss of one or more clients."
