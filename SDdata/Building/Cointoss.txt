'''The Cointoss''' was a run-of-the-mill tavern in [[Yartar]] that catered to the city's locals. As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, it was run by the former adventurer [[Tanataskar Moonwind]].

==Location==
It was located near the city's marketplace, known as the [[Fishyard]].

===Atmosphere===
The tavern was the locale of choice for Yartarrans. It was known for its quiet atmosphere and its cloistered clientele, who were adverse to rowdy or scheming activities.

It was poorly lit and unremarkable, just as Yartarrans preferred.

==Services==
The Cointoss earned its name from a standing wager set up by its proprietor. Any patron that could toss a [[coin]] through the eye slit of a [[helmet|helm]], earned a free drink.

==History==
The tavern's owner, Tanataskar Moonwind was once an cocky adventurer and a devout follower of [[Tempus]]. On one occasion, his pride got the better of him and Tempus took offense. The deity cursed Tanataskar to fly into an uncontrollable rage whenever he shed the blood of another.

Not wanting to hurt any companions or innocents, the devout warrior retired to run the Cointoss in Yartar. He was always eager to hear stories and adventures from his fellow Yartarrans.
