'''The Ice House''' was an icehouse business in [[Ravens Bluff]].

==Location==
This building was located on the fringes of the city's wealthier business district.

==Structure==
The Ice House was a rather large, white-painted building with a small shack outside of it. It was built above a series of cool, underground caverns that were used for the storing of its ice.
===Interior===
The interior spaces of this building were painted dark blue..

==Services==
This business created and stored ice through the use of [[spell]]s, which it then sold. Most of this ice was cut during the winter season and stored in its underground caverns, packed compactly into casks specially made by a local cooper to be insulated with sawdust.

The business sold {{SI|6|lb|k}} sacks of chipped ice at a cost of five [[gold piece]]s, which had been chipped through use of the ''[[shatter]]'' spell. They also sold ice blocks at a cost of one gold piece per {{SI|1|lb|k}} and their special casks at a price of five gold pieces. They supplied ice to most of the elite inns, noble households, and private clubs in Ravens Bluff. Having contracts with many of them to deliver ice to their doors each morning.

A side business of the Ice House during the hotter months was to sell flavor versions of its chipped ice from its shack. These cost two [[copper piece]]s, plus a three copper deposit for the returnable, earthenware cups and spoons they were served in.

Some time prior to [[1370 DR]], this establishment burned to the ground, forcing its proprietor to relocate the business to what would be named [[Winn's Ice House]].<ref>
