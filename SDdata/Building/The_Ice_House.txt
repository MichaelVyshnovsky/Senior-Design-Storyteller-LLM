The Ice House was an icehouse business in Ravens Bluff.
This building was located on the fringes of the citys wealthier business district.
The Ice House was a rather large, white-painted building with a small shack outside of it. It was built above a series of cool, underground caverns that were used for the storing of its ice.
The interior spaces of this building were painted dark blue..
This business created and stored ice through the use of spells, which it then sold. Most of this ice was cut during the winter season and stored in its underground caverns, packed compactly into casks specially made by a local cooper to be insulated with sawdust.
The business sold  sacks of chipped ice at a cost of five gold pieces, which had been chipped through use of the shatter spell. They also sold ice blocks at a cost of one gold piece per  and their special casks at a price of five gold pieces. They supplied ice to most of the elite inns, noble households, and private clubs in Ravens Bluff. Having contracts with many of them to deliver ice to their doors each morning.
A side business of the Ice House during the hotter months was to sell flavor versions of its chipped ice from its shack. These cost two copper pieces, plus a three copper deposit for the returnable, earthenware cups and spoons they were served in.
Some time prior to 1370 DR, this establishment burned to the ground, forcing its proprietor to relocate the business to what would be named Winns Ice House.
In the late 14 century DR, establishments that did business with the Ice house included Mothers Cupboard, the Vast Brewing Company, and the citys firefighting force the Red Ravens. Around this time one of the few businesses competing with them was the Two Brothers Butchery.
In the late 14 century DR, this establishment was run by the wizard Darra Winn and her three daughters, who inherited the business from her parents. In addition to Winns daughters, the business was staffed by Allston Salk and Ivo Durstan,
There were rumors that the caverns of this establishment had secret entrances connecting to catacombs and thieves hideouts underneath the city.
