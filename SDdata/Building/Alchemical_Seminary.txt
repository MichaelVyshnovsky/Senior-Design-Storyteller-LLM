The '''Alchemical Seminary''' was a famous school of [[alchemy]] and [[transmutation|transmutative]] magic in [[Eileanar]], the [[enclave]] of [[Karsus]].

==Location==
The school was found on the outer southeast edge of Eileanar, near [[the Ancient Scrolls]] group.

==Services==
The Seminary was the foremost institute in the fields of transformative magics and alchemical processes, being the finest in the enclave and all of [[Netheril]]. The master of the school was the venerable [[Quintus]], while fiery transmutations were taught by [[Hakewill]], watery subjects by [[Cujas]], airy magics by [[Thibauneau]], and earthy transformations by [[Fries (transmuter)|Fries]]. [[Delacroix]] was the master of [[potion]]s, [[oil]]s, and other liquid products, while [[Colombier]] was an expert in [[magical powder]]s and dusts.
