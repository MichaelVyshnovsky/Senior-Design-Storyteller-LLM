during Karsuss Folly
The Alchemical Seminary was a famous school of alchemy and transmutative magic in Eileanar, the enclave of Karsus.
The school was found on the outer southeast edge of Eileanar, near the Ancient Scrolls group.
The Seminary was the foremost institute in the fields of transformative magics and alchemical processes, being the finest in the enclave and all of Netheril. The master of the school was the venerable Quintus, while fiery transmutations were taught by Hakewill, watery subjects by Cujas, airy magics by Thibauneau, and earthy transformations by Fries. Delacroix was the master of potions, oils, and other liquid products, while Colombier was an expert in magical powders and dusts.
