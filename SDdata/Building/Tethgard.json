        "mainbody": "Tethgard was an ancient, ruined castle located in Hullack Forest.\nThe ruin was overgrown and mostly composed of isolated pillars, arches, half-arches, and stairs.\nThe watching spirit of Lady Duskreene, former ruler of Tethgard, resided there. She was an ancestor of Mirt.\nTethgard predated the realm of Cormyr.\nIn the 1360s DR, stories circulated in Cormyr of the ruins of legendary Tethgard, hidden in the depths of the Hullack Forest. These became a draw for adventurers operating out of Thunderstone.\nIn the , the ruins of Tethgard were the site of a bloody battle as, after failing to take Elminster, Storm Silverhand, and the Simbul into custody, a group of War Wizards and Purple Dragons unleashed their magics on the trio. Defending the three of them with a spell-shield that rebounded his opponents spells back at them, Elminster slew or maimed much of the group. The rest retreated."
