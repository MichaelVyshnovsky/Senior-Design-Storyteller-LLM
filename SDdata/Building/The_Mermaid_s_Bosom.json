Maalthiirs hoped visitors to the city would stop here first and kill each other, saving the Red Plumes the effort.\nBlood, ale, and saliva made the floor slick in the Mermaids Bosom.\nThe inn was situated on the coast of the Moonsea near the main docks.\nA room could be had for 3 gp per night. Murder and robbery were common occurrences in the Mermaids Bosom."
