        "Location": "The Black Eye was located in the center of the city on [[Silverpiece Way]], right off the [[Harbor Loop]].",
        "Activities": "The food at the Black Eye was not very good and cheap with most of the clientele were dockhands or whores.\n\nThe Black Eye was staffed with massive bouncers who were ready to break any of the fifths that were common at the tavern. Those who started trouble were tossed into the harbor, \"feeding the [[quelzarn]].\" Two bouncers who guarded the tavern ''circa'' [[1374]] were [[Gregory]] â€“ a giant of a man who loomed over any one customer, and [[Marv]], who was smaller than Gregory but was still an intimidatingly \"big man.\" Both were the tavern's co-owners and brothers of [[Little Davey]], the man who ran the establishment. At that time, the Black Eye had one hired dancer named [[Dimples]]. Little Davey allowed brawls, as long as the fighters cleaned up after themselves and did not use shivs or blades.\n\nThe tavern did not offer lodgings but had a selection of alcohol that included locally made [[Brother Tobias' 1368]], imported [[Night Masks' Nightmare]], as well as [[ale]], [[stout]], hard liquor, and [[wine]]. Despite the establishment being a tavern without any rental rooms, Little Davey allowed customers to just plunk themselves in the corner of the taproom along with other drunkards sleeping the revelry off.",
