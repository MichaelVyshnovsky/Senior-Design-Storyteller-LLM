'''Sharess' Caress''' was a [[festhall]] located on [[Wyrm's Crossing]] in the [[Outer City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Sharess' Caress stood on the eastern side of [[Wyrm's Crossing]] – the bridge that connected [[Rivington]] and the [[Twin Songs]] neighborhoods of the [[Outer City]], just past the checkpoint gate that allowed entrance to the bridge, across the street from [[Fraygo's Flophouse]].

==Structure==
The festhall was a structure of three stories and one sub-level. It opened into a thin taproom filled with seats at the bar, the hostess counter, and several booths. The taproom had one stair up to the second and third floors and two stairs to the sub-level – the kitchen and its large larder to the left from the entrance and a curtained entertainment chamber with a stage and musical instruments. The second and third floors had more seating and tables available for the guests, and the third floor expanded across the bridge to the western side and housed several thematic lodgings where guests met similarly thematic [[prostitute|escorts]].

The second entrance into the festhall was accessible from the bridge's walkways that overlooked the cliffs and the [[River Chionthar]] on the opposite side of the building. The walkway had several tables available to customers who preferred fresh river air to [[perfume]]s and [[incense]] of [[Sharess]].

The "Nymph's Grotto" room was decorated in a sylvan manner and had a sizable bath. "Elminster's Library" was styled after a [[wizard]]'s lair. The "Underdark Pleasures" room was quite self-explanatory. And lastly, "Devil's Den" was a lavish and splendorous room fit to satisfy some of the most posh devils.

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Mamzell [[Amira]], the festhall's proprietress, sought investigators who would be interested in seeking out the coinlass named [[Ffion Goldgrind]], better known as the "Stern Librarian," who disappeared and left her clients' bookings unattended. Ffion fell victim to the [[Murder Tribunal]] cultists of [[Bhaal]], and her body was discovered next door at Fraygo's Flophouse. During the same time, one special consort took residence in the festhall's "Devil's Den." This suave individual was [[Raphael]], who used the room to forge infernal contracts rather than offering sexual favors.

==Notable Inhabitants==

===Employees===
* [[Amira]], the festhall's over in the late 15{{th}} century DR and the owner of especially vain [[cat]] named [[Kira (cat)|Kira]].
*[[Ffion Goldgrind]], the dwarvish coinlass who entertained guests of "Elminster's Library."
*[[Hoots Hooligan]], a big and intimidating bartender. Her self-made drink – ''[[Hoots' Hooch]]'', was a potent mixture that possessed some peculiar effects on the imbibers.
*[[Naoise Nallinto]], the coinlass calling herself a "nymph," who entertained guests of the "Nymph's Grotto."
* [[Sorn Orlith]] and [[Nym Orlith]], [[drow]] twins who worked as expensive companions and escorts, servicing clients together. The twins laying together was harmless, according to them, as Sorn was magically rendered sterile.
