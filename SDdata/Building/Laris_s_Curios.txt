}}'''Laris's Curios''' was one of a few shops in all of [[Faer√ªn]] that bought and sold [[magic item]]s. It was located in [[Hillsfar]].

==Locations==
The shop was found in the south central part of the city.

==Defenses==
A pair of [[stone golem]]s shaped like [[gynosphinx]]s guarded the establishment.

==Services==
Though the prices were certainly high, the shop did indeed provide magic items for anyone with enough coin to purchase them. Other available items included [[Material component|spell components]], [[gem]]s, and artwork. The shopkeeper was known for mercilessly haggling with adventurers to get their prices down until they agreed to his terms.

==Inhabitants==
As the name would imply, the shop was owned by a gruff man named [[Laris]].
