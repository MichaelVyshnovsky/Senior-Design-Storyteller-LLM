        "mainbody": "'''Maglart House''' was the home of the judicial branch of government in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}",
        "Location": "This building was directly across from the Dubrinlar gate (the western gate into Khôltar, the Iron City) and was one of the first buildings seen as people entered the gate heading east. The other structure in direct view through the gate was its south-side neighbor, [[Manycoins Hall]]. Together, these two edifices occupied the blunted point of the intersection between [[Orntathtar Way]] (which ran to the north east) and [[Hael Way]] (which headed a little south of east). Across Orntathtar Way was the decoratively carved [[Halamor's Tower]] and, hard by the north side of the gate, [[Darrusktraal]]&mdash;the duty-house and guard station for Dubrinlar. On the south side of the gate was the [[Maerador House of Welcome]].",
        "Structure": "This functional government courthouse was large and solidly built of stone. It had several towers topped with spires.",
        "Services": "Cases that required a trial or at least an appearance before a judge were brought to Malgart House. The malgart (the local word for judge and judges) heard the testimony of all concerned parties in a courtroom and pronounced a verdict. Some malgart acted as \"guides\" &mdash;an intermediary between the judge and the accused&mdash;questioning the accused and presenting the city's case."
