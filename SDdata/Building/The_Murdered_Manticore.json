        "Description": "Heavy tapestries were prevalent through the Manticore, absorbing much of the sound from its occupants. Unbeknownst to the guests, secret passages connected every room.",
        "Activites": "Despite the activities occurring under the roof the inn, the Murdered Manticore was a great place to stay because of the reasonable pricing and privacy afforded.\n\nThough the Manticore did not serve food, drinks could be had aplenty."
