        "mainbody": "The Amberforge was a smithy in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.\nThe Amberforge was a one-story building in fair condition.\nThe owner of the Amberforge, Amber Smithkin was known for her no-nonsense demeanor and an intolerance for disrespect, particularly in regard to her craft. Her reputation as a master of her trade, combined with her physically imposing presence, discouraged most from challenging her. However, customers who approached her with proper respect were rewarded with high-quality metal goods, including nails, horseshoes, pots, cauldrons, and various ironworking tools. The products she forged were durable and reliable, offered at average prices that reflect their solid workmanship."
