        "mainbody": "The '''Amberforge''' was a smithy in the [[Skullport/Central Trade Lanes|Central Trade Lanes]] of [[Skullport]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The Amberforge was a one-story building in fair condition.",
        "Description": "The owner of the Amberforge, [[Amber Smithkin]] was known for her no-nonsense demeanor and an intolerance for disrespect, particularly in regard to her craft. Her reputation as a master of her trade, combined with her physically imposing presence, discouraged most from challenging her. However, customers who approached her with proper respect were rewarded with high-quality metal goods, including [[nail]]s, [[horseshoe]]s, [[pot]]s, [[cauldron]]s, and various ironworking tools. The products she forged were durable and reliable, offered at average prices that reflect their solid workmanship."
