Amalaes was a beauty shop in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.
This building stood at the northwestern end of the culdesac The Boomgarden.
The proprietors of this shop offered baths, hair-washing, hair-stylings, "touches" (manicures and pedicures), and other cosmetic applications within separate rooms of the building.
Additionally, those who worked here would offer patrons a fee to share a bed with them for the night or to rent out their attic. Some wizards were known to rent out this attic so they could conduct private spell-study.
This shop was lived in and run by Amalae and her six housemates.
