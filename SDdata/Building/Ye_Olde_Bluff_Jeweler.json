        "mainbody": "e Olde Bluff Jeweler was a jewelry shop in the city of Ravens Bluff during the mid-1300s DR, run by the extremely skilled Shorlock Revahl, who performed his craft with absolute enthusiasm and alacrity.\nThis store was located along MacIntyre Path, in the Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff.\nThis two-story building was a striking sight, being composed of polished white marble and having a roof of obsidian tiles.\nThe interior was just as impressive as the exterior, with a stunning showroom that featured Revahls fine pieces, as if they were works of art. The second story served as home to the old jeweler, featuring his personal collection of sculptures and paintings. Among these were an original from the renowned Ambrose Pistlewaite.\nAll sorts of gem-ornamented accessories were sold at this store. From rings, brooches and tiaras, predominantly crafted from gold, to bracers or amulets that would later be enchanted by arcane wizards."
