'''The Stag Triumphant''' was a sophisticated inn, the best in [[Mosstone]], second only to the popular and expensive [[Oak-Father's Boon]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Stag Triumphant was inside an elegant building of dark-wood panels. The establishment was nestled between the Oak-Father's Boon and the significantly cheaper [[Rumnthorygh's Welcoming House]] in the luxury and quality of services it provided.

==Interior==
The Stag's interior was filled with old but expensive high-quality dark leather furniture. The walls were draped in luscious curtains that stretched along seemingly endless dark-carpeted hallways and passages.

===Atmosphere===
The staff of the Stag wore pristine uniforms and were skilful and proper. They greeted travelers, guests, and unusual-looking foreigners with the same comfort and as they did familiar locals. The staff's polish was so they memorized guest's faces, names, and preferences even if they showed up every few years. The personal consisted of old and friendly faces recognizable by merchants that frequented the Stag on their travels. But the inn also annually hired fresh young attractive lads and lasses.

==Services==
The inn offered lodgings, three rich meals, snacks, as a multitude of alcoholic beverages. The typical morningfeast at the Stag Triumphant consisted of [[omelet]]s, stuffed with chopped [[sausage]], [[bacon]], and topped with [[onion]]s and [[pepper]]s. The inn's highsunfeast was a "meal in a bowl." The [[bowl]]s served were usually [[stew]]s accompanied by [[bread]]s, [[garlic]], and [[herb]] [[butter]]s. The stews varied from generously [[spice]]d [[eel]] and [[mushroom]] bowls, [[honey]] and [[lemon]] [[chicken]] drenched in thick [[greenshoot]]s [[soup]], or even especially exquisite [[oyster]] and [[almond]] stew. Evenfeasts were a sight to behold at the Stag. The dining hall was filled with [[spit-roast]]ing beasts, such as [[ox]]en, [[boar]]s, and [[turtle]]s. The main spectacle of evenfeasts, however, was the dish with the same name as the inn, "[[Stag triumphant (food)|stag triumphant]]," a fully roasted and stuffed young male [[deer]]. The dining continued late into the night.

To cap the night, the Stag offered platters of smoked and [[salt]]ed [[ham]] and accompanied with drinks. The alcohol selection at the Stag consisted of expensive [[sherries]], [[cordial]]s, [[zzar]], as well as [[wine]]s and [[beer]]s.
