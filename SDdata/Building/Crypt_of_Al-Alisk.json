        "mainbody": "The Crypt of Al-Alisk was an ancient mausoleum in the Desert of Al-Alisk. The wizard Martek used it as a trial for his Inner Sanctum.\nThe Crypt of Al-Alisk was located  northeast of the crystal pillar in the Desert of Al-Alisk.\nThe entrance of the crypt was a staircase leading into a cavern, which had pillars at the entrance. Once past the entrance, the tomb itself had a fourfold rotational symmetry. There were four rooms similar to the entrance of the crypt, complete with fake doors akin to the entrance. Each of those fake exits was a  room with an altar covered in black cloth in the middle, with a pair of bronze doors on the far end. One of the fake entrance rooms held the skeletons of a minotaur and a man wearing chain mail.\nAt the center of the crypt were four pillars, which maintained an enchantment over a crystal cylinder  in diameter. Within the cylinder lay a kneeling young woman, with one of Marteks miniature crystal minarets by her side. Only by destroying the pillars could she be freed, and the minaret retrieved.\nThere was a line of spectral minion guardians outside of the crypt at all times, except for three hours after midnight, when the Lancers of Death distracted them. The crypt proper was patrolled by wights and wraiths as well. Habrauk Al-Nirin, a spectre, protected the entrance himself, together with a group of moaning minions, capable of frightening people into fleeing the crypt. Two of the fake entrances were protected, one by a groaning spirit, and one by five cockatrices.\nThe only live inhabitants of the crypt were five cockatrices. Nothing else but undead were inside, including Habrauks spectre, a groaning spirit, wights, wraiths, and spectral minions. Princess Sithal Al-Husns spirit remained imprisoned inside.\nThe Crypt served as the sepulcher of the Al-Alisk clan until their destruction. Martek spirited away the crypt and a section of desert in order to use it as a trial for adventurers after its destruction. In , Marteks minaret was retrieved, releasing the princess in the process."
