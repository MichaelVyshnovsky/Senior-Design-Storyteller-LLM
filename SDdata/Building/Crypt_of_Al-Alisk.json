        "mainbody": "The '''Crypt of Al-Alisk''' was an ancient mausoleum in the [[Desert of Al-Alisk]]. The wizard [[Martek]] used it as a trial for his [[Inner Sanctum]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}",
        "Location": "The Crypt of Al-Alisk was located {{SI|15|miles|k}} northeast of the crystal pillar in the [[Desert of Al-Alisk]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation/Map}}",
        "Structure": "The entrance of the crypt was a staircase leading into a cavern, which had pillars at the entrance.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|124}} Once past the entrance, the tomb itself had a fourfold rotational symmetry. There were four rooms similar to the entrance of the crypt, complete with fake doors akin to the entrance. Each of those fake exits was a {{SIAdj|30|foot|long=yes|adj=wide}} room with an altar covered in black cloth in the middle, with a pair of [[bronze]] doors on the far end. One of the fake entrance rooms held the skeletons of a [[minotaur]] and a man wearing chain mail.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|125}}\n\nAt the center of the crypt were four pillars, which maintained an enchantment over a crystal cylinder {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. Within the cylinder lay a kneeling young woman, with one of Martek's miniature crystal minarets by her side. Only by destroying the pillars could she be freed, and the minaret retrieved.",
        "Defenses": "There was a line of [[spectral minion]] guardians outside of the crypt at all times, except for three hours after midnight, when the [[Lancers of Death]] distracted them. The crypt proper was patrolled by wights and wraiths as well. [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]], a spectre, protected the entrance himself, together with a group of moaning minions, capable of frightening people into fleeing the crypt. Two of the fake entrances were protected, one by a groaning spirit, and one by five cockatrices.",
        "Inhabitants": "The only live inhabitants of the crypt were five [[cockatrice]]s. Nothing else but [[undead]] were inside, including Habrauk's [[spectre]], a [[groaning spirit]], [[wights]], [[wraiths]], and spectral minions. Princess [[Sithal Al-Husn]]'s spirit remained imprisoned inside.",
        "History": "The Crypt served as the sepulcher of the Al-Alisk clan until their destruction. [[Martek]] spirited away the crypt and a section of desert in order to use it as a trial for adventurers after its destruction. In {{yearlink|1356}}, Martek's minaret was retrieved, releasing the princess in the process.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}"
