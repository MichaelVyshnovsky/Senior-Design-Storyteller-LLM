        "mainbody": "dermath Orchard was an apple orchard in Phandalin in the late 15 century DR.\nThe orchard was located on the northwest side of Phandalin, The trees surrounded a small group of buildings in which the orchards business took place, and the house of the owner, Daran Edermath, was nearby.\nThe orchard operated year-round, and thus always smelled strongly of apples. In the warmer months, the orchard produced fresh fruit and juice, while in the winter, fruit was processed into cider and other products. The orchard counted both visiting merchants and local food and drink establishments as customers.\nAs of 1491 DR, the land was kept by Daran Edermath, who would occasionally allow the orchard to be used as a place to rest. By 1496 DR, the orchard had grown into a successful business that provided employment for out-of-work miners."
