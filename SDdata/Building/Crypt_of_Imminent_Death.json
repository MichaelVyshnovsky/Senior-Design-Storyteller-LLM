        "mainbody": "The Crypt of Imminent Death was a temple dedicated to Jergal, the Forgotten One, found in Bezantur in Thay.\nThe temple was located in north-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" It sat across the street from the House of Entropy.\nIt was a small structure by the standards of Bezantur temples. The temple was constructed of black marble shot with gold veins. The temple also was capped with an onion dome.\nDeath was a fact of daily life in Thay, and as Jergal was a constant presence amidst the death of Myrkul and the subsequent replacement of Cyric by Kelemvor as the primary god of death following the Time of Troubles, the congregation at the Crypt of Imminent Death steadily grew in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDyhna Zhyborrin served as high priestess of the Crypt of Imminent Death as of the midâ€“14 century DR."
