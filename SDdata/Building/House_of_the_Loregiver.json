        "mainbody": "The House of the Loregiver was a sacred site to Enlightened Zakharans found within the Golden Mosque in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThis building could be found in the Pilgrims District of the City of Delights.\nThe actual physical structure of the House of the Loregiver was not impressive since it was a simple one-room house made from clay.\nSince pilgrims enjoyed taking souvenirs from the house, many magical protections were put in place to protect the remaining structure. A wall of force surrounded the house. Those who were able to circumvent the wall were met with a magical feeling of dread. Those who pressed further were confronted with four noble genies, one for each elemental type. Anyone able to strike the house with malicious intent was instantly paralyzed.\nAdditionally, an honor guard of priests guarded the house at all times.\nMany Zakharans believed that this house was the dwelling of the woman who would become the Loregiver. However, other opinions existed as well.\nA sect of radical Zannites believed the location was only a house that existed during the time of the Loregiver. All believed that the house was where the first Grand Caliph experienced a vision that led him to the Loregivers scrolls.\nMany believed that being near the house helped ease their pain, though sages thought this was simple superstition."
