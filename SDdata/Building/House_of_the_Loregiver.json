        "Location": "This building could be found in the [[Pilgrims' District]] of the City of Delights.",
        "Structure": "The actual physical structure of the House of the Loregiver was not impressive since it was a simple one-room house made from clay.",
        "Defenses": "Since pilgrims enjoyed taking souvenirs from the house, many magical protections were put in place to protect the remaining structure. A ''[[wall of force]]'' surrounded the house. Those who were able to circumvent the wall were met with a magical feeling of dread. Those who pressed further were confronted with four noble [[genie]]s, one for each elemental type. Anyone able to strike the house with malicious intent was instantly paralyzed.\n\nAdditionally, an honor guard of priests guarded the house at all times.",
        "History": "Many Zakharans believed that this house was the dwelling of the woman who would become the [[Loregiver]]. However, other opinions existed as well.\n\nA sect of radical [[Zann|Zannites]] believed the location was only a house that existed during the time of the Loregiver. All believed that the house was where the first [[Grand Caliph]] experienced a vision that led him to the [[Word of the Loregiver|Loregiver's scrolls]].\n\nMany believed that being near the house helped ease their pain, though sages thought this was simple superstition."
