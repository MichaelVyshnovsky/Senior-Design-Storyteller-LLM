The Old Stump was an expensive, but high quality, inn found within the town of Velarsburg in Harrowdale during the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Despite its price, it attracted outlanders who came to town shopping for furniture and other wooden crafts. It was known for its warm, caring atmosphere and good home-style cooking.
