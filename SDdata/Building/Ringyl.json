        "mainbody": "he Ringyl was a castle in Tressets Ringyl.\nTressets Ringyl was within a days march from Felmorel. The town holding the castle was itself nestled in a valley between six hills.\nThe castles towers were slender spires. It had tall battlements, and a wall.\nAcross one of the Ringyls crumbling walls, there was a room that resembled a chapel, with a high and vaulted ceiling the walls inside were painted to resemble trees with gilded fruit, and the floor had wavy bands of malachite. The far wall had a carving of a pair of lips, about as wide as a tall mans outstretched arms, surrounded by 12 or 14 irregular stars. Behind that carving was a hidden coffin on a catafalque. There was an underground level beneath the chapel.\nAs of , the castles walls were fallen.\nOnce, a bandit by the name of Tresset had raised the castle to anchor a realm hed dubbed Tressardon. The kingdom didnt survive him for more than a few days. As of the midâ€“8 century DR, the castle and town were deserted, during Elminster Aumars wanderings in service of Mystra.\nAfter the battle between Elminster and Silent Antlers, an obscure entity, the chapel inside the Ringyl crumbled apart, and the lips in the chapel shattered, a catafalque bursting out in tilting over, the coffin fell through the ground into the lower level. Then it exploded. One of the arms of the catafalque, actually an enchanted scepter, was then reclaimed by Dasumia somehow, despite having been turned into dust by the explosion."
