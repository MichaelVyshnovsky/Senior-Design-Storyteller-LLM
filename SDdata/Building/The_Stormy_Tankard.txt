'''The Stormy Tankard''' was an inn in [[Scornubel]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The Stormy Tankard stood on [[Hethbridle Street]].

==Structure==
The place had at least one side door. The stairs were narrow, and there was at least one narrow passageway leading to a secret door. Some of the rooms were accessible from that secret door.

==Interior==
The place was noisy and filthy, with minuscule rooms and rather rickety furniture.

==Services==
The inn served rooms, had a common taproom, and much "unclasped and uncloaked" merriment, strongly implied to be carnal, was negotiated there.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, [[Shandril Shessair]] and [[Narm Tamaraith]] were pointed to the Stormy Tankard by [[Tessaril Winter]] while on their way to [[Silverymoon]]. [[Marlel]], after rescuing them from [[the Sun Over Scornubel]], helped the two newlyweds to the place; they were ambushed inside the inn, thanks to Marlel, but he denied all knowledge of the ambush and helped them find [[Orthil Voldovan]] afterwards, who was downstairs in the taproom.
