'''Mulhorandi Portal''' was the name given to an extremely obscure [[Portal|portal]] in the [[Raurin]] Desert, the work of the ancient wizard-kings of [[Imaskar]].

==Description==
The portal lay in a ruin hidden beneath the [[sand]]s of the Raurin, close to a temple of [[Set]] as of {{yearlink|1372}}. It was momentarily revealed on occassion by the shifting of the winds, but it would always go back to being hidden by the sand shortly after.

==Portal==
The portal itself was keyed to a release of divine magic through a spell of evil or darkness, which would activate the portal for a few seconds. While activated, it rendered its surface a rippling sheet of darkness, giving no clue of what may lay on the other side.

The portal led to an unnamed [[Outer Planes|Outer Plane]] which resembled the Raurin, with the sun in perpetual twilight. There were no native creatures. Though the atmosphere was breathable, there was nothing to eat or drink. The portal on the returning side was malfunctioning, likely stranding visitors to the plane.

==Rumors & Legends==
The Outer Plane beyond the portal may have been a repository of ancient Imaskari magic, sure to draw the attention of [[Red Wizards]] or Imaskari [[lich|liches]]. Had the priests of Set uncovered it, they might have also used it as a retreat.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Racial Portals of Faer√ªn:Mulhorandi Portal}}
