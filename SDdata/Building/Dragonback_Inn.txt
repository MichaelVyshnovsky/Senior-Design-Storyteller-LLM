The Dragonback Inn was an inn in Daggerford.
The inn was located in the northwest corner of Daggerford along Wall Street, Fields Lane, and Horse Way.
The inn was a large building with fieldstone walls to chest height and wooden walls above, supported by thick timbers. The windows were made from dark-green, leaded glass, and above the door there hung a wooden sign. A dragon skull hung over the fireplace in the main room, and the walls were decorated with banners and shields.
The Dragonbacks owner was a heavyset dwarf with white whiskers and a red nose.
