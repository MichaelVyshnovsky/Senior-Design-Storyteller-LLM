The '''Gathering of Magicians''' was a school located in the city of [[Heldapan]] in [[Durpar]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The school focused on teaching young [[mage]]s the nature of [[magic]]. The Gathering of Magicians was a favored place for [[illusionist]]s to go to learn the ways of their craft. Given the acceptance of magic in Durparian society, the school was exceedingly popular, and a prospective student usually had to be on the waiting list for several years before being admitted. Money, of course, could speed this process up considerably.
