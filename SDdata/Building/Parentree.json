        "Location": "It was located in the northwestern part of the city's [[Sheshyrinnam]] district.{{Template:Cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves/Map}}",
        "Structure": "This breathtaking twelve-story [[cathedral]] was built within the hollowed-out form of a gigantic [[shadowtop]] tree that had been transformed into [[ivory]] by means of [[elven high magic]]. The great temple-tree was {{SI|100|ft}} wide at its base, and stood some {{SI|400|ft}} tall at its apex, which had been opened up to the skies above.",
        "Activities": "The Parentree was the site for the city's celebrations of the major holidays associated with the [[Seldarine]]. On occasion it did play host to private wedding ceremonies, but only for members of the noble Cormanthyrian families.\n\nCorellon's Choir sang from a position at the temple's ground floor, a position that allowed their choruses to echo throughout the concavity of the ivory tree's interior. Magical enhancements allowed for their songs to resonate far beyond the temple's walls to the People that listened outside."
