        "mainbody": "The Parentree was a monumental temple of Corellon built in the city of Cormanthor. It was considered to be the most-holy of temples in the entirety of the Cormanthyrian empire.\nIt was located in the northwestern part of the citys Sheshyrinnam district.\nThis breathtaking twelve-story cathedral was built within the hollowed-out form of a gigantic shadowtop tree that had been transformed into ivory by means of elven high magic. The great temple-tree was  wide at its base, and stood some  tall at its apex, which had been opened up to the skies above.\nThe Parentree was the site for the citys celebrations of the major holidays associated with the Seldarine. On occasion it did play host to private wedding ceremonies, but only for members of the noble Cormanthyrian families.\nCorellons Choir sang from a position at the temples ground floor, a position that allowed their choruses to echo throughout the concavity of the ivory trees interior. Magical enhancements allowed for their songs to resonate far beyond the temples walls to the People that listened outside."
