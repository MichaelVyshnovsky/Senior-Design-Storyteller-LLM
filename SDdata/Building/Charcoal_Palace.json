The basalt was so dark that it appeared to drain light from the flames surrounding the city. Gold, brass, and copper were used to cover many of the towers and domes of the palace.\nThe Charcoal Palace was perched atop a landrise overlooking the entire city. A huge fountain of purple fire, called the Breath of the Sultan, was found before the palace as the sign of the Sultans constant rule and vigilance.\nThe Charcoal Palace served as the seat of power for the Great Sultan of the Efreet, Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan and his court of efreeti tyrants."
