The Tower of Balance was a minor temple of Mystra in the city of Silverymoon.
This temple was located in the eastern part of the Northbank section of Silverymoon. It stood north of the High Palace.
From its outward appearance this temple was often mistaken for a wizards tower.
The Tower of Balance was often the site of many strange magical effects, which seemed to combine arcane and divine magic into unique new forms.
Sometime in 1366 DR, following a religious service the acting Magister Thukmuul Teleshann resigned from his position. With only the briefest of comments Thukmuul named his successor, Eriladar Leafsigil, before living the building.
In the mid-14 century DR, the Magister of the Tower of Balance was Thukmuul Teleshann. After resigning, he appointed Eriladar Leafsigil as his successor. Another notable member of the clergy was Brother Morgan Starfox, who ministered to worshipers in the afternoon.
