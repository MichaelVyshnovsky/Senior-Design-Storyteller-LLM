The '''Tower of Balance''' was a minor temple of [[Mystra]] in the city of [[Silverymoon]].

==Geography==
This temple was located in the eastern part of the [[Northbank]] section of Silverymoon. It stood north of the [[High Palace]].

==Description==
From its outward appearance this temple was often mistaken for a [[wizard]]s' tower.

==Activities==
The Tower of Balance was often the site of many strange magical effects, which seemed to combine [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]] into unique new forms.

==History==
Sometime in [[1366 DR]], following a religious service the acting Magister [[Thukmuul Teleshann]] resigned from his position. With only the briefest of comments Thukmuul named his successor, [[Eriladar Leafsigil]], before living the building.

==Inhabitants==
In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Magister of the Tower of Balance was Thukmuul Teleshann. After resigning, he appointed Eriladar Leafsigil as his successor. Another notable member of the clergy was Brother [[Morgan Starfox]], who ministered to worshipers in the afternoon.<ref>
