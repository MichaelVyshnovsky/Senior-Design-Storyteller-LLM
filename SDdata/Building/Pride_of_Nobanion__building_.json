        "mainbody": "he Pride of Nobanion was a large temple devoted to Nobanion, the King of Lions found within the city of Nathlekh on the Dragon Coast.\nThe temple was constructed to appear as if it rose from the granite of the acropolis upon which it was founded. Many pillars arranged in colonnades supported the Pride of Nobanions portico. The entire structure was decorated with statues of lions in various natural poses.\nNathlekhs judiciary, composed of a trio of greater lammasu, held court within the Pride of Nobanion on a weekly basis.\nMany lions wandered the halls and gardens of the temple, but only harassed others if provoked."
