        "Services": "The inn offered cozy, thoughtfully-decorated rooms that were kept very tidy. The staff was well-mannered and quite attentive.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The ''Maiden Dances'' was so named for the spectral [[elf]] woman who periodically appeared within the inn. While it was a beautiful sight it only appeared to those that were considerably inebriated.\n\nThe inn was actually constructed over the location where the elf-maiden was buried."
