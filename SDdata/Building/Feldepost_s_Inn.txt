'''Feldepost's Inn''' was an old establishment located in the town of [[Beregost]] on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Reeducation|6}}

==Atmosphere==
It was a quiet, comfortable inn that was a favorite among the elderly.

==Services==
The staff here was careful, considerate, and polite, though service did tend to be slow as a result. Except during days of warmer weather, each room provided a lit fire for the comfort of its guest. Every patron who booked a room was treated to a drawn bath, with water to the temperature of their choosing. Attendants were a handful of kindly old men who said little, but aided customers with bathing if they so requested. This made it appealing to the aged and infirm.

The inn hired entertainers such as minstrels, but could not pay them as well as the [[Jovial Juggler]].

In the 1480s DR, folk in Beregost liked to start the day with a quiet meal and casual conversation at Feldepost's Inn, making it popular in the mornings.

===Food and Drink===
The food served in Feldepost's was quite superior to that found in other establishments. Dishes included such highlights as [[cheese]]-and-[[cucumber]] buns and [[mushroom]] [[tart]]s, which were on the house with the purchase of beverages. These were served by the fireplace in the evenings. A fine [[sherry]] was also available; this was stored in the cellar. Meals were warm and hearty.

==History==
This old inn drew its name from its founder and first owner, who died sometime before [[1366 DR]].

In the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], the [[mage]] [[Tranzig]] stayed at the inn, while acting as an intermediary between the bandit-captain [[Tazok]] and the [[Cyric]]ist [[cleric]] [[Mulahey]]. When confronted by [[Abdel Adrian]], he attacked his party and was killed. Meanwhile, one of the patrons was [[Marl]], a farmer whose son became an adventurer and was killed; he got drunk and got into an argument with visiting adventurers. Another drunken patron was [[Gyllian]]. A wealthy guest known as [[Algernon]] also stayed there.

The inn remained in business in the late 1400s DR. One morning in the 1480s DR, the peaceful morningfeast was disrupted by the [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]] [[Hsing]], who met some [[adventurer]]s and enlisted them to search for his mistress [[SEER]] in the ruins of the [[Ulcaster School of Wizardry]].
