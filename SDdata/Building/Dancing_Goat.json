            "Atmosphere": "The Dancing Goat was busy, noisy, and full of raucous entertainment twenty-four-ten. It was ''not'' a place for peace and quiet. It catered to single folk hoping to flirt or find a partner, and professional escorts often went there too. Unfortunately, it also tended to attract pickpockets and other [[rogue]]s."
