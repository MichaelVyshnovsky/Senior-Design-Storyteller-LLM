        "mainbody": "he Dancing Goat was a bawdy tavern in Silverymoon.\nThe Dancing Goat was found on the right side of the Moonway in Northbank, just after one crossed the Moonbridge from the southern half of the city.\nThe tavern had a revelry-filled dance floor. The rest of the establishment contained dimly lit hallways and upstairs rooms.\nThe Dancing Goat was busy, noisy, and full of raucous entertainment twenty-four-ten. It was not a place for peace and quiet. It catered to single folk hoping to flirt or find a partner, and professional escorts often went there too. Unfortunately, it also tended to attract pickpockets and other rogues.\nThe tavern had a surprisingly good selection of beverages, with literally hundreds of vintages stored in its cellar.\nThe Dancing Goat had been in business since at least 1358 DR.\nA secret door somewhere in the tavern was said to connect with a network of subterranean passageways beneath the Silverglen and leading ultimately to Harper Hall.\nCategoryTaverns\nCategoryLocations on the Moonway\nCategoryLocations in Northbank\nCategoryLocations in Silverymoon\nCategoryLocations in Luruar\nCategoryLocations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nd8box0isux0tg4c614mo3tnmsxscnz8"
