'''Edermath Orchard''' was an [[apple]] orchard in [[Phandalin]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The orchard was located on the northwest side of Phandalin, The trees surrounded a small group of buildings in which the orchard's business took place, and the house of the owner, [[Daran Edermath]], was nearby.

==Services==
The orchard operated year-round, and thus always smelled strongly of apples. In the warmer months, the orchard produced fresh fruit and juice, while in the winter, fruit was processed into [[cider]] and other products. The orchard counted both visiting merchants and local food and drink establishments as customers.

==History==
As of [[1491 DR]],{{Phandelver-time}} the land was kept by [[Daran Edermath]], who would occasionally allow the orchard to be used as a place to rest. By [[1496 DR]],{{AI-time}} the orchard had grown into a successful business that provided employment for out-of-work miners.
