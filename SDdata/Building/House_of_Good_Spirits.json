        "mainbody": "The '''House of Good Spirits''' was the guildhall of the [[Guilds of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian guild]] known as the [[Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild]].<ref>",
        "Location": "The House of Good Spirits was located in the [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It stood on the northwest side of the [[Rising Ride]], between the mouths of [[Juth Alley]] and [[Robin's Way]], extending north and west along [[Tornsar Alley]] as far as [[Buckle Street]]. On that street one could find an alleyway leading to the back of the tavern, offering access to complex's inn and stables.",
        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "On the inside, the buildings that made up of the House of Good Spirits were directly joined and similarly had the look of a factory or warehouse to themâ€”large exposed beams and bare mud brick walls throughout. There were many small passages and nooks, odd doorways, and surprise steps. Furnishings in them were rather bare-bones and ordinary, yet comfortable.\n\nThe inn was comfortable, yet disorganized. Within the long windows of the tavern hung purple and white curtains, embroidered with the guild's mark.\n\nSome of the buildings had private meeting rooms that were available for conferences. One large building was dedicated to the storage of [[zzar]], which gave it a distinctive [[almond]] scent."
        },
        "Services": {
            "Provender": "In terms of food the inn had a rather basic menu. Serving patrons such things as roasted [[boar]], [[rabbit]]-and-smalls stew (vegetables and various small game, such as [[fowl]]s or [[squirrel]]s), and [[cheese]]-and-[[mustard]] [[salt]]bread melts (small, circular loaves of [[bread]]).\n\nThe specialties of the House of Good Spirits were zzar and [[sluth]], which were brewed on site. One could purchase sluth for two copper pieces a bottle, a lower rate than what was charged elsewhere, and six silver pieces for a [[bottle]] of zzar. Other beverages included [[Neverwinter black icewine]] for seven silver pieces, [[Best Old Mintarn whisky]] for one [[gold piece]], [[Wyvern whiskey]] for two gold pieces, [[elverquisst]], and [[blackthroat]]. With it notably being one of the few places in Waterdeep one could find elverquisst for sale."
        },
        "History": "In the 1300s [[DR]], this complex began as a small brewery on the corner of the Rising Ride and Tornsar Alley. Soon after the tavern was opened for business. Some time in the early 1360's the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild expanded the House of Spirits into an adjacent warehouse, which they repurposed as an inn for the convenience of visiting [[grape]] cultivators and wine merchants.",
        "Inhabitants": "Many members of the Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild considered the House of Good Spirits to be a secondary home, staying at it whenever their own homes were overcrowded or being worked upon. During daylight hours, there was always a representative of the guild present for those wanting to deal in spirits.\n\nThe overall staff of the House of Good Spirits numbered forty individuals. [[Simon Thrithyn]] acted as the innkeeper in the 14{{th}} century DR. [[Dlarna Suone]] and [[Gordrym Zhavall]] were the chief buyers and sellers for the guild. And there were seven burly bouncers, led by [[Mrorn Halduth]].",
        "Reputation": "The House of Good Spirits was among some of the more notable and recognizable inns in the Southern Ward, being considered a landmark.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "A widely spread rumor in Waterdeep was that the [[Guild Adventuring Company|Flying Flagons]], under sponsorship of the guild, slew a [[dragon]] and the large treasure hoard brought back remained hidden somewhere in or under the House of Good Spirits. Because of this rumor the staff had to warn visitors against digging or prying at the ceilings, floors, and walls."
