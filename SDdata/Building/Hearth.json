        "mainbody": "The Hearth was a festhall located in the castle-library of Candlekeep during the 15 century DR. It was located in the keeps Court of Air, between the House of Rest bunkhouse and the public bathhouse.\nThe hall had a number of shrines, dedicated to the deities of knowledge&mdashDeneir, Gond and Milil.\nThirty people could dine here comfortably at any time. The Hearth was always open, and its fire was never permitted to go out. A dozen patrons typically occupied the pub during the day, with more during lunch and supper.\nFrom an external perspective, the Hearth seemed like a humble tavern built solidly, its cozy glow streaming through a couple of tiny windows flanking the entrance. Inside, the building seemed three times larger within. The Hearth gained its larger dimensions courtesy of extradimensional magic crafted by devotees of Gond. Suspended in the ceiling over the bar was an intricate clockwork device encased within a two-foot-diameter crystal orb emitting a faint glow. Known as geometric amplifier among the Avowed, it served as the source of the magic necessary to uphold the expanded spaces integrity.\nThe pub had a low ceiling upheld by massive wooden crossbeams, with narrow, shuttered windows dotting the walls. In the center of the room stood a substantial fire pit, never permitted to go out.\nThe bar could accommodate up to twenty customers on its seats, while patrons could also find comfortable seating at round tables paired with sturdy wooden chairs or rectangular tables complemented by benches. A dozen soft, cushy armchairs had encircled the fireplace positioned at the rooms center.\nThe Hearth boasted numerous doors along its walls, visible to patrons in the taproom yet seemingly invisible from the exterior. These doors led to individual demiplanes, each measuring , designated either as private meeting spaces or shrines. While the shrines were open for anyone to enter, access to a private chamber necessitated a key from the barkeep and a payment of 5 gp.\nInside each meeting chamber, a modest setup greeted visitors, featuring a sizable round table surrounded by chairs, along with sideboards stocked with dishes and cutlery. A menu and beverage list adorned one wall, allowing those within to place orders for food and drinks as they convened.\nEach of the shrines was outfitted with a simple wooden altar, tables, and benches for study and reflection, along with suitable wall hangings. These adornments varied from deity to deity but generally included beautiful tapestries telling key stories of the relevant deity or framed, illuminated scriptures discussing and illustrating the gods key tenets."
