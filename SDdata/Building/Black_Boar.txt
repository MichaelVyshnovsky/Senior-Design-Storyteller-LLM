'''The Black Boar''' was an expensive and posh but crammed inn in [[Iriaebor]], known for its slow service, small rooms, and meager food.

==Services==
The inn employed too few staff for its abundant clientele, resulting in notoriously slow service and small-portioned meals.

By [[1357 DR]], the Black Boar put its name on ale commonly found in expensive inns and taverns across the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Location==
The Black BoarÂ inn stood to the southwest of the [[High Tower of Iriaebor]], on the road from the city's docks, right where it split in two to circle around the tower. It was a prime location for an expensive establishment, an envy of merchants, who even tried to murder for it on a few occasions. Because of that, the owner of the inn preferred to stay incognito, keeping his name from the general public.

==Structure==
The inn was a large twin-towered building.

==Interior==
The tiny rooms and halls of the inn were furnished in exquisite luxury. The snobbery of the clientele guaranteed the establishment's full occupancy by the nightfall every single day.
