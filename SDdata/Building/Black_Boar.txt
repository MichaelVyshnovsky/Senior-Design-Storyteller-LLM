The Black Boar was an expensive and posh but crammed inn in Iriaebor, known for its slow service, small rooms, and meager food.
The inn employed too few staff for its abundant clientele, resulting in notoriously slow service and small-portioned meals.
By 1357 DR, the Black Boar put its name on ale commonly found in expensive inns and taverns across the Western Heartlands.
The Black BoarÂ inn stood to the southwest of the High Tower of Iriaebor, on the road from the citys docks, right where it split in two to circle around the tower. It was a prime location for an expensive establishment, an envy of merchants, who even tried to murder for it on a few occasions. Because of that, the owner of the inn preferred to stay incognito, keeping his name from the general public.
The inn was a large twin-towered building.
The tiny rooms and halls of the inn were furnished in exquisite luxury. The snobbery of the clientele guaranteed the establishments full occupancy by the nightfall every single day.
