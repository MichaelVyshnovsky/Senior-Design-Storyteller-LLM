        "mainbody": "'''Dalath's Span''' was a bridge across the [[River Mirar]] in the city of [[Luskan]].",
        "Location": "Of the three bridges that crossed the River Mirar within Luskan (the other two being the [[Harbor Cross]] and the [[Upstream Span]]), Dalath's Span was situated in the middle.",
        "History": "There were no local legends to provide a clue as to whom or what the bridge was named after.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], there was a [[Harper]] symbol under a high window at the south end of the bridge, and those in search of a Harper could make a [[seal]] noise during the night to summon one. Any who abused this passphrase or used it unwarily risked not only their own life but also the life of any Harper agent who responded to the call.\n\nAfter Luskan descended into anarchy following the events of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Dalath's Span was destroyed and could no longer be used to cross the river. In the decades that followed, local gangs would occasionally try to make short-lived repairs to the bridge in hopes of charging tolls, sometimes by simply fashioning a makeshift crossing out of [[rope]]s. The bridge remained impassable through the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, however it had been restored by the {{YearlinkName|1489}}."
