The '''Inn of the Dripping Dagger''' was the favored bar and home to many adventurers, mercenaries, misfits and soldiers in the city of [[Waterdeep]]. the Dripping Dagger's prices always seemed to be a bit lower for those who were down on their luck. [[Steak and kidney pie]]s were staples of the inn's menu.

==Description==
The inn was a rectangle, approximately thirty feet wide by fifty feet long. It also had a separate stables in a nearby alley.

The inn was constructed of fieldstone on the first level which housed the tap room, the kitchen and a private meeting room. Stairs close to the end of the bar led up to two levels of guest rooms made of timber construction. A further set of stairs led up to an attic space where there was a small office, storage rooms, and a few hidden rooms for weapons, goods, or people. There was also a cellar with jakes, storage, and a strongroom.

The roof of the building was flat. It had several carved statues of griffons with rings set into them where one could tether a flying mount. The roof also had a small chicken coop.

==Location==
The tavern was located in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep on the [[High Road]] between [[Selduth Street]] and [[Coffinmarch]].

==Inhabitants==
In [[1372 DR]] the inn was run by the courteous ex-mercenary, [[Filiare]].  In [[1479 DR]] the [[Lohthuntle]] family ran the Dripping Dagger. 

==History==
The inn was best known for its seemingly haunted front door which would utter cryptic and seemingly menacing phrases such as 'His head will be found in a basket on Ship Street.'  The city guard enlisted the help of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] who investigated the phenomenon.  The [[mage]]s of the order were unable to reach a conclusion as to the cause of the strange utterances but several theories remained popular ranging from a prank to the belief that a rogue Voice of [[Oghma]] was responsible.

The [[Company of Crazed Venturers]] once called this place home, before they built their own keep. A famous mishap included a ''teleport'' gone awry which left the Company unarmed in the taproom with the bar itself destroyed and their foes close on their heels.

Another incident involved a young princess from [[Cormyr]], [[Alusair Obarskyr]], escaping her attendants and winding up here - play-wrestling and throwing daggers with the warriors in the taproom before a city watch patrol found her.

Throughout the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the inn became known as a place that turned no one away.
