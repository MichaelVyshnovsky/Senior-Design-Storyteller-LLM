'''Oldstone Hall''' was a [[manor]] house located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]] and home of the town's lords.

==Location==
The manor house lay in the center of town, on Wheloon Way, opposite the [[Wheloon Moothouse]].

==Description==
Oldstone Hall was the grandest building in Wheloon. Its façade was an impressive edifice of soot-darkened stone, intricately decorated with carved monsters: [[gargoyle]]s, [[gremlin]]s, [[jubbrawuk]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[wyvern]]s. It was built in the style of early Cormyrean manor houses, of palatial size and almost a [[castle]], suggesting old pride, old wealth, and old entitlement.

It was surrounded by large paddock of lush, well-groomed grass, dotted with many big and old [[duskwood (tree)|duskwood]], [[oak]], and [[shadowtop]] trees. This was, in turn, enclosed by high stone walls and a set of gates. Stone monsters on plinths also flanked the gates and rested on the walls.

==Defenses==
The gates were warded against unauthorized visitors by ''[[ring ward]]''s that triggered a warning alarm if contacted.

Of the stone monsters guarding the walls and manor, the gargoyles were said to animate if commanded by the lord of Wheloon or the [[Court Wizard]] of Cormyr.

==Inhabitants==
Oldstone Hall was the home of the lords of Wheloon. In the mid-to-late 14th century DR, this was Lord [[Sarp Redbeard]]. Other privileged guests could stay there, such as the king's messengers, [[War Wizards]], and some [[Harpers]]. Few others were allowed beyond the gates.
