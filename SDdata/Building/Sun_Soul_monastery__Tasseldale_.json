It was located in a re-purposed ruined freehold within the [[Dun Hills]]. The monks of this order, along with followers of [[Tyr]] from the [[Abbey of the Just Hammer]], contributed greatly to the pacification of monsters, particularly [[goblin]]s, in the region.",
        "Recruitment": "While the monks of this monastery freely opened their doors to prospective students of all nations and races, they were particularly uncompromising on those who hailed from [[Sembia]]."
