The Old Oak was an inn and tavern found in Marsember, Cormyr. It remained in business throughout the 14 and 15 centuries DR.
Previously it had been a noble house but was later somewhat run-down, with rotten wood and patches of mold.
It was fairly inexpensive and the cost of a room included stables. The food was bland but was prepared hygienically, and the tavern served a variety of ales and wines.
As the 1480s DR, the inn featured music by bards and other performers. One minstrel of note was the singer and lyrist Elbertina, an alias of the young noblewoman Arietta Seasilver.
