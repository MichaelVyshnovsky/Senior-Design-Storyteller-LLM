'''The Old Oak''' was an inn and tavern found in [[Marsember]], [[Cormyr]]. It remained in business throughout the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Description==
Previously it had been a noble house but was later somewhat run-down, with rotten wood and patches of mold.

==Services==
It was fairly inexpensive and the cost of a room included stables. The food was bland but was prepared hygienically, and the tavern served a variety of ales and wines.

As the 1480s DR, the inn featured music by [[bard]]s and other performers. One minstrel of note was the singer and lyrist Elbertina, an alias of the young noblewoman [[Arietta Seasilver]].{{Template:Cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|48}}
