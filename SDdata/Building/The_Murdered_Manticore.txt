The Murdered Manticore, or simply the Manticore, was a nice inn to visit in Arabel, Cormyr, particularly if you wanted to hear juicy gossip or participate in illicit activities such as forgery.
Heavy tapestries were prevalent through the Manticore, absorbing much of the sound from its occupants. Unbeknownst to the guests, secret passages connected every room.
Despite the activities occurring under the roof the inn, the Murdered Manticore was a great place to stay because of the reasonable pricing and privacy afforded.
Though the Manticore did not serve food, drinks could be had aplenty.
