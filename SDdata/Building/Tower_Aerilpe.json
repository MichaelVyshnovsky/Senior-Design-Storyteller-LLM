        "History": "When she returned to Sildëyuir in winter of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, it was an elegant tower of pale white stone and glass, ringed with a sturdy [[granite]] wall pierced by a [[mithral]] gate. The windows and treetops glowed with blue light. A silvered slope lay in the direction of [[Moonveil Citadel]]; the path there crossed a river with a glowing stone bridge. The location had been overrun by weeds, and the corpses of the half dozen guards were still rotting.{{cite book/Stardeep|222}}The still-rotting bodies in midwinter suggest that their deaths were relatively recent; thus, this article makes the assumption that their deaths could not have been more than a month old. Thus, the fortress' destruction is written as having occurred in 1375 DR."
