Emerald Fires was a shop in the Central Trade Lanes of Skullport in the late 14 century DR.
Emerald Fires was a one-story building of stone and wood in fair condition.
Emerald Fires was operated by Selantha, a skilled artisan. Since 1364 DR, Selantha has managed the business alone following the mysterious disappearance of her husband during a trading mission. She had established a reputation for creating intricate decorative filigree work, particularly on armor. Her designs, often featuring elegant patterns and fine detailing, cater to those seeking artistry alongside functionality.
While her specialty lay in enhancing armor, Selantha also undertook a wide range of projects, crafting items from copper, brass, and silver. Her work included everything from practical items, such as copper pots and pans, to ornate silver candlesticks shaped like fruit trees or branching vines. The cost of her creations ranged from above average to high, while their quality varied from average to good.
Among her regular customers was Sergeant Belan Kargis, a well-known local mercenary who was drawn to her shop through her armor work.
