The Axe and the Minotaur was a tavern located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR before that citys destruction.
The Axe and the Minotaur was located in the Common Quarter of western Zhentil Keep. The tavern was found along Cobble Road near the western Trail Gate.
The tavern was a popular spot for Zhentilar soldiers to blow off steam. Given its proximity to the Trail Gate, agents of power serving the Zhentarim were usually snooping around here as well in order to monitor who entered the city.
