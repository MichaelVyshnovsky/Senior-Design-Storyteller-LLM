The '''Needle''' was a water tower in [[Luskan]] situated on the north side of [[Setting Sun Street]], and was used during weekly flushes of the sewer system. 

==Structure==
The tower could also be used as a water supply in case fires broke out in the city. The Needle was fed from the [[River Mirar]] by a series of windmills that pumped water upwards into its tank.
