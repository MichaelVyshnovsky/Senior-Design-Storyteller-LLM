The Needle was a water tower in Luskan situated on the north side of Setting Sun Street, and was used during weekly flushes of the sewer system. 
The tower could also be used as a water supply in case fires broke out in the city. The Needle was fed from the River Mirar by a series of windmills that pumped water upwards into its tank.
