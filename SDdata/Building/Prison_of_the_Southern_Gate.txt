The Prison of the Southern Gate was a large dungeon located in the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Prison of the Southern Gate was located within the Furdah Rustauk District in southwest Dhaztanar. As its name implied, the prison stood just a stones throw from the Madinats southern gate. Only a small canal and several bridges separated the nobility of Dhaztanar from the criminals of the city.
The main exterior surrounding wall of the prison was hexagonal in shape.
