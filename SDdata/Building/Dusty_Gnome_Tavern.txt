The Dusty Gnome Tavern was an inn and a tavern located in the town of Leilon on the Sword Coast North.
The tavern stood just off the towns sleepy central square.
The Dusty Gnome catered to local miners who boisterously partook in ale-fueled revelries after their long hard shifts. Any visitor was greeted with laughter, loud voices, and clanking of ale flagons.
In the late 14 century DR, the establishment was ran by a middle-aged male human innkeeper who offered libations and cheap guest accommodations.
