'''Basult's Books''' was a bookshop located in the city of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]], on the western end of the city. ''Circa'' [[1374 DR]], it was the only bookseller in town, and was run by [[Amnic Basult|Amnic]] and [[Mela Basult]].

==History==
Early in the month of [[Eleint]] in the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], Amnic went missing; he was last seen in his shop, where signs of a scuffle could be found. Although distraught, Mela tried to manage the bookshop in Amnic's absence.

Eventually, on [[Eleint 6]], adventurers discovered that the new [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in town was actually a front for priests of [[Shar]] and [[Cyric]] to kidnap magic-users and spirit them away to the [[Vast Swamp]] for some nefarious purpose. Investigators found Amnic's body in a torture chamber beneath the false temple. Mela was informed of her husband's fate.
