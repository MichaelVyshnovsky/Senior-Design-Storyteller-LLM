        "mainbody": "'''Thorm's Mill''' was the only one of its kind in the city of [[Ashabenford]], a bustling [[gristmill]] that processed wheat, oat and other grains from all around the [[Dalelands]]. Due to the fact the [[River Ashaba]] became very shallow near [[Elven Crossing]] further downstream, the mill's owner [[Thorm Ubler]] was able to maintain a monopoly on milling within [[Mistledale]]. Thorm was known as a miserly man, and used his position to heavily overcharge the dalesfolk.{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}}\n\nThere were a number of attempts to build a rival mill on the river near the [[Yeven Trail]], each of which have ended with fire or bandit raids."
