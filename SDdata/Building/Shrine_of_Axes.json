        "mainbody": "he Shrine of Axes was a multi-faith shrine found in the small town of Parnast circa the late 15 century DR.\nIt comprised a simple woodmans shack, with statues of several deities found within.\nThe shrine featured a statue of the elven deity Angharradh, meant to represent the season of spring to the local townsfolk. The goddess likeness was surrounded by statues of four Faer√ªnian deities that represented three seasons of the year Auril for winter, Chauntea for summer, and Mielikki for autumn.\nAt some point in the 1480s DR, the statue of Angharradh had been vandalized and the hands of the goddess had been removed. The statue of Mielikki on the other hand had been well preserved and even refurbished."
