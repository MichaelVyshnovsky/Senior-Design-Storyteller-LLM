The Mosque of the Thirsty Jann was a religious structure dedicated to the worship of Jarmik, a local god.
This small mosque was located along the Pilgrims Route between Zayir and Hilm.
At full capacity, the Mosque of the Thirsty Jann could accommodate 100 worshipers.
The mosque was staffed by 10 priests and 22 laymen. Tufala min-Jarmik led the priests.
The servants of Jarmik provided food and water to the large multitude of pilgrims passing through the area. A sacred well provided water that cured disease and rejuvenated the body, but only if cupped into the hands and consumed. The water lost all of its magical properties if it touched anything other than flesh.
