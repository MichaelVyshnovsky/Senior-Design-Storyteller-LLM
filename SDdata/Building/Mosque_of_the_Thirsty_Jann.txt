The '''Mosque of the Thirsty Jann''' was a religious structure dedicated to the worship of [[Jarmik]], a local god.

==Description==
This small mosque was located along the [[Pilgrims' Route]] between [[Zayir]] and [[Hilm]].

At full capacity, the Mosque of the Thirsty [[Jann]] could accommodate 100 worshipers.

==Inhabitants==
The mosque was staffed by 10 priests and 22 laymen. [[Tufala min-Jarmik]] led the priests.

==Activities==
The servants of Jarmik provided food and water to the large multitude of [[pilgrim]]s passing through the area. A sacred well provided water that cured disease and rejuvenated the body, but only if cupped into the hands and consumed. The water lost all of its magical properties if it touched anything other than flesh.
