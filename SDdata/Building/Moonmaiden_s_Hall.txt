Moonmaidens Hall was a prominent and powerful temple of Selûne in Murann, on the coast of southern Amn.
The temple lay in the far southwestern corner of Murann, between the water of Tarseth Bay and the southern city gate.
The Hall was made from the bow of a ship, with the rear deck serving as the pulpit. The altar was located inside a huge, intricate armillary sphere, from inside which the priest performed their holy work.
The temple primarily represented Selûnes domain of navigation and sailing to the mercantile port city, though all her aspects were regarded and respected by her many worshipers in Murann. The churchs closest competition in the city were the temple of Umberlee and the Storm Horn temple of Valkur.
In 757 DR, the leader of the temple was High Moonmistress Zarran Tonnos, who condoned the destruction of the New Moon Pact, a holy order of lycanthropes.
By 1370 DR, the temple was overseen by Lunar Crister Flechan.
