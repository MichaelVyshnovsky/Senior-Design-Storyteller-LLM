'''Ollie's Discount Potions''' was a discount [[potion]]s shop in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Flask Circle]] market in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Hands of Mohammad|10}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|5}}

==Structure==
Several glass cases could be found within the store, displaying its vast array of potions. And a small [[bell]] hung above the entryway, ringing upon anyone entering the shop.

==Services==
Ollie's sold a wide variety of potions in all manners of color, shape, and size. The majority of these potions were unlabeled as a deterrent to [[thieves]], though a select few had stiff pieces of [[paper]] in front of them that had their name written down.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|6}}

Potions were not sold at a static price, but rather frequently individually adjusted in value based upon the local supply and demand.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}

Customers were typically limited to buying three potions at a time in order to ensure a moderate stock was maintained. Some of the potions on offer on a given day included potions of ''[[potion of animal control|animal control]]'', ''[[potion of clairaudience|clairaudience]]'', ''[[potion of clairvoyance|clairvoyance]]'', ''[[potion of climbing|climbing]]'', ''[[potion of diminution|diminution]]'', ''[[potion of ESP|ESP]]'', ''[[potion of healing|healing]]'' and ''[[potion of extra-healing|extra-healing]]'', ''[[potion of fire resistance|fire resistance]]'', ''[[potion of levitation|levitation]]'', ''[[potion of polymorph self|polymorph self]]'', ''[[potion of rainbow hues|rainbow hues]]'', ''[[potion of speed|speed]]'', ''[[potion of water breathing|water breathing]]'', and ''[[elixir of health|elixirs of health]]''.

==History==
Sometime in the late 14{{th}} century DR, a group of thieves called the [[Hands of Mohammad]] robbed Ollie's Discount Potions of nearly all its inventory while the owner was away and the nearby Practical Potions of its entire stock. Three days later a group of [[adventurer]]s came to the Flask Circle asking about both robberies, having been tasked by the [[City Watch (Ravens Bluff)|City Watch]] to track down the thieves, but the operator of Ollie's had nothing to share and the owner of Practical Potions had since fled from Ravens Bluff.

==Inhabitants==
This store was operated by an [[elf]] simply known as [[Ollie]].
