        "mainbody": "'''Thrymstone''' was an ancient fortress built by [[frost giant]]s in [[Dragonscar Gorge]] that was lost and buried beneath the snow for centuries as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Structure": "The architecture of the fortress were recognizably [[giant]] in origin. Elements of the ruined fortress spanned much of the Gorge, although the main citadel remained intact and buried.",
        "History": "The fortress was erected to challenge the [[white dragon]]s of the [[Frozenfar]]. According to legend, it was built by the frost giant [[Shattercrown]] using rocks that he wrested from the god [[Thrym]].\n\nThrymstone served as the site of many fierce battles between frost giants and white dragons, which ultimately caused so much damage as to create Dragonscar Gorge. The struggle exhausted the dragons and triggered an avalanche that scattered the giants and buried the fortress for centuries.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, Shattercrown launched a ruthless and tireless effort to excavate and claim the fortress.<ref group=\"note\">It is not clear whether this is the same Shattercrown who built the fortress or a successor using the same name. The dig was led by Shattercrown's lieutenant, [[Horrengar]], who forced the [[Frosthunger Horde]] to dig out the massive ruins. Soon, ruined arches and walls dotted Dragonscar Gorge, but they were unable to find any holes in the main walls and so were forced to try and dig out the main gates. After several years of hard labor, much of the Horde abandoned the dig and fled Dragonscar Gorge. As they did, they attacked neighboring [[Shimmersky Valley]], which attracted the attention of [[Waterdeep]] and led to the arrival of [[adventurer]]s. These adventurers averted a second war between giants and dragons by driving off the white dragon [[Kovanyrach]], and then defeated Horrengar and Shattercrown just as they succeeded in excavating the gates and reclaiming the fortress."
