        "mainbody": "The Temple of Odin in the city of Bral was perhaps the only shrine to the god Odin in Realmspace.\nThe Temple of Odin was actually a small shrine, but it was one of the oldest on the Rock of Bral and was well-respected.\nThe temple was located in the Low City on the starboard side of Grand Street, near the port-side entrance to the Lesser Market.\nIt was debatable whether or not the priest of Odin could even communicate with his god,â€”had a presence in Realmspace. However, by the end of the 14 century, the congregation of worshipers at the shrine numbered about 100.\nThe shrine was founded in the early 14 century DR by vikings from another world who were transported to Realmspace by an enigmatic space storm."
