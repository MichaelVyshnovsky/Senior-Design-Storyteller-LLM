        "mainbody": "3\nThe Font of Knowledge was a temple of Oghma in Waterdeep on the Sword Coast North in the late 14 century DR. It also included a library, known as the Great Library, and a monastery.\nThe temple stood in the citys Castle Ward, amongst a block of buildings just east of Swords Street and south of Tzochails Race. It lay roughly between the Halls of Justice, a temple of Tyr, to the east, and Blackstaff Tower, on the other side of Swords Street. Formerly, the site was used for a block of warehouses.\nIt was among the largest temples in the city and considered beautiful, From the street, stone steps led up to the double-doored entrance.\nIt was a three-story building, converted into a four-story building, and constructed of wood and stone.\nFrom the entrance, one stepped into the Hall of the Binder, a stone-walled entry chamber that rose three stories high. Within stood a mighty statue of Oghma carved from green marble. He was depicted as a muscular nude man, with very long hair and beard, posed as if about to take flight. Over  above the floor, his outstretched left arm clutched a golden scroll while apparently just gold sheeting, it was rumored to contain secrets of the gods. This statue had been donated by Khelben Arunsun, the Blackstaff, during the temples construction and was thought to have once stood in the grounds of Oghmas temple in Myth Drannor. Climbing it was considered blasphemous.\nOn either side of the Hall of the Binder, behind the statue, were two sets of double doors, themselves two stories in height. These led into the Great Library of the Binder, which covered four whole floors and included a scriptorium for writing and copying manuscripts.\nOn the second floor, a keyed two-way portal joined a library on the second floor of the Zoarstar, the guildhall of the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerks Guild, and to a secret library in a hidden chamber of the Maze Level of Undermountain.\nThe temples Great Library was of course the key service offered by the Font of Knowledge to Waterdeep. It housed the largest and best-quality collection of books and scrolls in the City of Splendors, rivaled only by the New Olamn bardic school the House of Wonder temple of Mystra the Tower of the Order, guildhall of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors and the House of the Moon, a temple of Sel没ne, and its own Great Library. Moreover, it was public library, wherein visitors could view any book. In the late 1400s DR, the temple maintained arrangements with local booksellers to get first pick on tomes on certain topics such as lost history, and would pay well for such texts.\nAn unofficial sideline was the so-called \"Council of Sages\", a kind of \"market square\" for sages, scholars, and experts of all kinds. Although Waterdeeps sages were famously independent, many had begun passing hours at a time in the library each day, so adventurers looking to consult one in a hurry took to finding them here. As a result, paid inquiries conducted at the library were taxed at 10% by Sandrew the Wise. The Council of Sages originated in the scholars and librarians recruited by Sandrew to build the Great Library.\nHence, either way, the Font of Knowledge was a good place to go to research all kinds of topics and to find maps, have texts translated, unearth secret lore, as well as to obtain clerical healing. On the side, the priests also produced wine from their own press.\nFinally, the Oghmanyte priests at the Font of Knowledge provided free lessons in reading to all who asked for it, helping Waterdeep to become one of the most literate cities in Faer没n as of the 1490s DR.\nThe temple was led by Savant Sandrew the Wise in the late 1300s DR.\nCirca 1372 DR, the church counted 172 members,This 172 number may count priests and lay worshipers, whereas the earlier number only counts priests. with 110 humans, 17 elves, 17 half-elves, 9 halflings, 9 gnomes, 5 dwarves, 3 half-orcs, and 2 of other races. They were clerics, bards, experts, rangers, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards. Senior clerics occasionally trained as bards as well.\nJoining the church required a demonstration of understanding of its teachings and a vow of devotion to Oghma. Though there was no fee to join, there were dues of 5 gp per month. Members were expected to follow the tenets of the faith and work in the libraries for about 10 hours a tenday.\nThe priests wore yellow robes.\nMembers trained in areas of diplomacy, speaking and deciphering languages, history, religious lore, spellcraft, and concentration.\nThose of strong faith and favored by the temple could achieve prodigious feats of research and recall of even the most obscure knowledge, albeit only rarely in their lives. To achieve this, they must conduct research or pray to the Binder for a period of 1 hour in any temple of Oghma.\nMany spellcasting members were initiated into the magical secrets of the church.\n* Loremaster Most High Sandrew the Wise, Savant of Oghma, high priest of the temple.\n* Hroman, a priest with a leadership position.\n* Loremaster Gustyl the Curious, a gnome priest and scholar of mages of the North.\n* Loremaster Phanar Manthar, assistant and later successor to Gustyl.\n* Jhasper Goldtoes, librarian and expert in trade and commerce.\n* Hycis Gentilore, librarian and expert in elven history and culture.\n* Aria Whucknolls, librarian, expert in religion and human deities, sister to Cera.\n* Cera Whucknolls, librarian, expert in demihuman languages, sister to Area.\n* Damlath, a wizard who helped in the temples construction.\n* Sangalor of the Secrets, a mind flayer cleric of Oghma living in Skullport who visited the temple on a regular basis and was potentially considering joining fully.\n* Sulphon, an expert in magical beasts and aberrations.\n* Ilighast Chamnabbar, an expert in magical traditions the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, and Elemental Planes and the histories of dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings in northwest Faer没n.\n* Blackrabbas Khuulthund, an expert in the flora and fauna of northwest Faer没n.\n* Alcedor Kolat, an enchanter and maker and researcher of staves, wands, and other magical items.\n* Javroun Lithkind, an expert in geography and human history, genealogy, and politics.\n* Touras Niveradon, leader of the Cult of Ao.\n* Geth Stormlight, an elderly sage and tutor.\nWhile Waterdhavian bards, sages, and wizards had a long tradition of venerating the Lord of Knowledge, the church of Oghma itself did not have a significant presence in the city. That changed when Savant Sandrew arrived in Waterdeep around 1362 DR with the vision to build a temple and library worthy of the Lord of Knowledge in the City of Splendors. He had come from Silverymoon with a small number of fellow priests and wizards, including Damlath and his master and they occupied a rowhouse on Swords Street, which served as their temporary temple. The ground-floor shop was used for worship and meetings, while the upper three floors housed the priests.\nOver the 1360s DR, Savant Sandrews hard work and delicate negotiations led to the construction of the Font of Knowledge and the Oghmanytes becoming established as a major faith in Waterdeep. and adding a fourth floor. among them, Raegar Stoneblade, a burglar who would join the church. A school for the citys children was also planned. However, this rise did steal some attention and support previously enjoyed by Gonds temple, the House of Inspired Hands.\nProjected to be finished before Midsummer, construction was completed in Midsummer in the . The clergy and books moved in and the Font of Knowledge opened that year with the largest and best collection of books in all of Waterdeep. It enjoyed a sharp increase in attendance and donations, as well as popularity across the North. However, certain folk back in Silvermoon disdained it for what they saw as attempts to replicate the achievements of their own city, while several Waterdhavian noble scions emigrated to Silverymoon.\nNevertheless, work on the temple continued through Ches of the following year, and the Swords Street rowhouse remained in use for housing.While Faiths & Avatars and City of Splendors Waterdeep have the temple completed on time in Midsummer of 1368 DR, the novel Rising Tide, published between the two, describes it as still under construction in 1369 DR. It seems likely that the temple is open and operational, but work continues on some parts, such as priest quarters. On Ches 30 of the , the priest Hroman allowed the old bard Pacys to stay at the rowhouse after he entertained the priests there.\nOn Uktar 29 of the , the lich Priamon \"Frostrune\" Rakesk dominated the Oghmanyte ex-thief Raegar Stoneblade and compelled him to steal the golden scroll from the statue of Oghma, in the belief it was an artifact of Rhaelnars Legacy. He burst into the Hall of the Binder and scaled the statue, while three pursuing sharn emerged from portals and slew those in the Hall who tried to stop them. Fortunately, Khelben the Blackstaff and Tsarra Chaadren, and her tressym Nameless intervened and rescued Raegar, when they came to meet with Sandrew. However, the golden scroll scroll was magically stolen.\nA century later, in the , the Font dispatched Brother Cieran to purchase a book, Lexicon on the History of Thay, from a local bookseller, Gannon. Unfortunately, devil agents of Asmodeus sought to suppress this work and got their hands on it first. Later that year, adventurers may have researched Morgan Estelmer at the library.\nAround 1492 DR, Halaster Blackcloak was scrying on the Font of Knowledge, amongst other Waterdhavian landmarks, via a false portrait kept in the Halasters Tower demiplane accessed from Undermountain.\nThe Font of Knowledge maintained a strong alliance with the New Olamn bardic college and close links with the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerks Guild. Further afield, there was a free flow of information between the Font of Knowledge, New Olamn, and the Vault of Stars and various libraries of Silverymoon.\nThe temple also received significant funding from two of Waterdeeps noble houses, House Estelmer and House Majarra.\nUnder High Harper Eather Heilean in the early 1370s DR, the Harpers of Waterdeep slowly began to work more closely with the clergy of Oghma, as well as those of Milil, Sune, and Tymora."
