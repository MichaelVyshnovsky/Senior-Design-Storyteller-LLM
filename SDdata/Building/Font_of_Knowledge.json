        "Location": "The temple stood in the city's [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]], amongst a block of buildings just east of [[Swords Street]] and south of [[Tzochail's Race]]. It lay roughly between the [[Halls of Justice]], a temple of [[Tyr]], to the east, and [[Blackstaff Tower]], on the other side of Swords Street. Formerly, the site was used for a block of warehouses.",
        "Description": "It was among the largest temples in the city<ref> and considered beautiful, From the street, stone steps led up to the double-doored entrance.",
        "Structure": "It was a three-story building, converted into a four-story building, and constructed of wood and stone.",
        "Interior": "From the entrance, one stepped into the Hall of the Binder, a stone-walled entry chamber that rose three stories high. Within stood a mighty statue of Oghma carved from green [[marble]]. He was depicted as a muscular nude man, with very long hair and beard, posed as if about to take flight. Over {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} above the floor, his outstretched left arm clutched a golden scroll; while apparently just gold sheeting, it was rumored to contain secrets of the gods. This statue had been donated by [[Khelben Arunsun]], the Blackstaff, during the temple's construction and was thought to have once stood in the grounds of Oghma's temple in [[Myth Drannor]]. Climbing it was considered blasphemous.\n\nOn either side of the Hall of the Binder, behind the statue, were two sets of double doors, themselves two stories in height. These led into the Great Library of the Binder, which covered four whole floors and included a scriptorium for writing and copying manuscripts.\n\nOn the second floor, a keyed two-way ''[[portal]]'' joined a library on the second floor of the [[Zoarstar]], the guildhall of the Scriveners', Scribes', and Clerks' Guild, and to a secret library in a hidden chamber of the [[Maze Level]] of [[Undermountain]].",
        "Activities": "The temple's Great Library was of course the key service offered by the Font of Knowledge to Waterdeep. It housed the largest and best-quality collection of books and scrolls in the City of Splendors, rivaled only by the New Olamn bardic school; the [[House of Wonder]] temple of [[Mystra]]; the [[Tower of the Order]], guildhall of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]]; and the [[House of the Moon]], a temple of [[Sel没ne]], and its own Great Library.<ref> Moreover, it was public library, wherein visitors could view any book. In the late 1400s DR, the temple maintained arrangements with local booksellers to get first pick on tomes on certain topics such as lost history, and would pay well for such texts.\n\nAn unofficial sideline was the so-called \"Council of Sages\", a kind of \"market square\" for sages, scholars, and experts of all kinds. Although Waterdeep's sages were famously independent, many had begun passing hours at a time in the library each day, so [[adventurer]]s looking to consult one in a hurry took to finding them here. As a result, paid inquiries conducted at the library were taxed at 10% by Sandrew the Wise. The Council of Sages originated in the scholars and librarians recruited by Sandrew to build the Great Library.\n\nHence, either way, the Font of Knowledge was a good place to go to research all kinds of topics and to find maps, have texts translated, unearth secret lore, as well as to obtain clerical healing. On the side, the priests also produced [[wine]] from their own press.\n\nFinally, the Oghmanyte priests at the Font of Knowledge provided free lessons in reading to all who asked for it, helping Waterdeep to become one of the most literate cities in Faer没n as of the 1490s DR.",

        "History": "{{fq\n| text   = We've not got an extra room at the moment.

That changed when Savant Sandrew arrived in Waterdeep around [[1362 DR]] with the vision to build a temple and library worthy of the Lord of Knowledge in the City of Splendors. He had come from [[Silverymoon]] with a small number of fellow priests and wizards, including [[Damlath]] and his master and they occupied a rowhouse on [[Swords Street]], which served as their temporary temple. The ground-floor shop was used for worship and meetings, while the upper three floors housed the priests.\n\nOver the 1360s DR, Savant Sandrew's hard work and delicate negotiations led to the construction of the Font of Knowledge and the Oghmanytes becoming established as a major faith in Waterdeep. and adding a fourth floor. among them, [[Raegar Stoneblade]], a burglar who would join the church. A school for the city's children was also planned. However, this rise did steal some attention and support previously enjoyed by [[Gond]]'s temple, the [[House of Inspired Hands]].<ref>\n\nProjected to be finished before [[Midsummer]], construction was completed in Midsummer in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. The clergy and books moved in and the Font of Knowledge opened that year with the largest and best collection of books in all of Waterdeep. It enjoyed a sharp increase in attendance and donations, as well as popularity across the North. However, certain folk back in Silvermoon disdained it for what they saw as attempts to replicate the achievements of their own city, while several Waterdhavian noble scions emigrated to Silverymoon.<ref>\n\nNevertheless, work on the temple continued through [[Ches]] of the following year, and the Swords Street rowhouse remained in use for housing.<ref group=\"note\">While ''Faiths & Avatars'' and ''City of Splendors: Waterdeep'' have the temple completed on time in Midsummer of 1368 DR, the novel ''Rising Tide'', published between the two, describes it as still under construction in 1369 DR. It seems likely that the temple is open and operational, but work continues on some parts, such as priest quarters. On [[Ches 30]] of the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the priest Hroman allowed the old bard Pacys to stay at the rowhouse after he entertained the priests there.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = Besides, don't you wish to learn more for those little scribes of the Font of Knowledge?
