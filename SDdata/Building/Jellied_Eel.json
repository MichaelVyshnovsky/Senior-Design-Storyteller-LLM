        "mainbody": "The Jellied Eel was one of the oldest and most well-regarded restaurants in the city of Ravens Bluff. It was owned and run by a group of Ravenian knights, who purchased it out from more seedier owners, who almost ran the establishment into the ground.\nThe dining area featured two long, and narrow halls, with a below-ground kitchen. These halls were decorated with a few oversized paintings and a number of large brass shields.\nThe Eel offered its patrons large platters with generous portions, so that no customer could ever possibly go hungry. Among their dishes were roast potatoes with lemon, cinnamon-infused rice, crispy-beaver-pie and roast stag, covered in gravy. Despite the name of the establishment, they offered no plates of eel.\nAlthough the Jellied Eel has long-been a favored, upscale establishment within the citys Temple District, it fell into ill-repute for a short time. Prior to being bought by the knights, the Eel had deteriorated into a dimly-lit eatery whose main attraction was its bevy of exotic dancers. Following its change of ownership, the landmark was returned to its former glory."
