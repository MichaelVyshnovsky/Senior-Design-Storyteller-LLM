The '''Blue Clam''' was a tavern located in the docks of [[Termalaine]], within the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]. It was the favored establishment of fishermen and its decor was a reflection of its clientele.

==Interior==
The Clam had a number of long hearths that were lined with engraved tables and benches. Its walls were decorated with [[scrimshaw]], carved from the bones of [[knucklehead trout]], and fish that were mounted as trophies.

==Services==
In addition to drinks, the tavern offered spiced chowder and the occasional roasted [[hare]] or [[moose]].
