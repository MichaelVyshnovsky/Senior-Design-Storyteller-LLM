The Blue Clam was a tavern located in the docks of Termalaine, within the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. It was the favored establishment of fishermen and its decor was a reflection of its clientele.
The Clam had a number of long hearths that were lined with engraved tables and benches. Its walls were decorated with scrimshaw, carved from the bones of knucklehead trout, and fish that were mounted as trophies.
In addition to drinks, the tavern offered spiced chowder and the occasional roasted hare or moose.
