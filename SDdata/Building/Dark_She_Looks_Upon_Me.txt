'''Dark She Looks Upon Me''' was a busy eatery, or ''aszraun'', located in the Mercantile District of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The ''aszraun'' was located in the Mercantile District that bordered the Government's District and was a short walkable distance from the glorious many-spired [[Temple of Waukeen (Arrabar)|Temple of Waukeen]].

==Interior==
Dark She Looks Upon Me was a large establishment that offered a busy common room with tables and private, comfortable dining alcoves. The restaurant's rear had several [[jake]]s available to its customers. Jakes were located at the back entrance to the ''aszraun'', in a long narrow hall with several private alcoves with [[chamberpot]]s. Straight from the jakes, the back door led to the often empty backyard.

===Atmosphere===
The place was always crowded, but an individual with a few extra [[gold]] coins placed in the right hands could find available tables or even a private dining area.

==Services==
Dark She Looks Upon Me was a well-known tavern that served [[roasted beef]] and [[lamb talthaek]], among other foods.

==History==
On [[Tarsakh 11]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, two members of the [[Order of the Sapphire Crescent]], [[Vambran Matrell]] and his uncle [[Kovrim Lazelle]] attended dinner at the Dark She Looks Upon Me. During this young Vambran was ambushed by a band of assassins, sent by [[Grozier Talricci]] in attempts to stop Matrell from investigating an assassination witnessed by Vambran a night prior. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Vambran Matrell serendipitously survived the assault.
