        "mainbody": "'''Harhallo's Warmhearth House''' was an inn located [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}}",
        "Location": "This establishment was located on the east side of [[North Way]], a short walk south of Handrornlar, the northern gate in the walls of the Iron City. It was just south of [[Oraundro Nempeth's]] rope and wire shop and [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]]. On its other side were hiring firms, a locator service, and a barrel maker.",
        "Structure": "This building was small compared to most buildings in Khôltar and showed its age. It was built by [[dwarves]], for dwarves, to have privacy and quiet&mdash;the walls were more than 3 ft (90 cm) thick.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "This inn was very popular in its heyday, but began a slow decline when [[Taurgaur's Tarjteir]] opened up just on the other side of the  wide intersection of North Way with [[Orntathtar Way]]. By 1372 DR, Harhallo's averaged about twice as many [[human]] patrons as dwarf, and the clientele was noticeably older and/or penurious."
        },
        "Services": "Room and board at Harhallo's was 9 [[sp]] per night. This included a room with a bed, a bath, and a meal for the traveler, and a stall with water and straw (and a wash, if needed) for one mount or beast of burden. The meal brought to the guest's room was typically slices of a plain roast, onion soup, and biscuits. Drinks in the common room could be had at extra cost. A tankard of beer or ale sold for 4 [[cp]]; the limited selection of inexpensive wines were a bit more.",
        "History": "This inn had passed down through the generations twice&mdash;[[Yontur Harhallo]] was the third Harhallo to own and operate this house of welcome."
