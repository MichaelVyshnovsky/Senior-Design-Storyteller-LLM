'''The Fine Gold Chain''' was a popular adventurers' club in [[Memnon]].<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

==Location==
This club was located in the northwestern [[drudach]] of the south-central [[sabban]] of Memnon.<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

==Structure==
The Fine Gold Chain was nearly impossible to miss for a visitor to Memnon, owing to its unique architecture. The [[sandstone]] building was constructed to look like a castle right out of a fairy tale. It had rounded balconies, precarious bridges, and narrow turrets.<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

==Interior==
The interior decor included carved [[gargoyle]]s, which were often used for hanging customers' hats.<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

===Atmosphere===
The club was open to current and future adventurers and those desiring to learn about an adventurer's lifestyle. It was bustling with activity both night and day.<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

==Services==
The club was expensive, but everything was of excellent quality. Foods included an assortment of rare monster meats. The location was a site for recruitment sessions for adventuring companies and caravans. The latter groups commonly were seeking folk willing to serve as caravan guards on the journey across the [[Calim Desert]]. Retired or jobless adventurers would put on performances here or model for painters, and one could usually find members on staff who could appraise or repair weapons and armor. The bards' tales told here were always of legendary proportions.<ref name=EotSS-p113/>

==Inhabitants==
The proprietor, [[Jalavaerra Ishtra]], was herself a retired adventuress.<ref name=EotSS-p114/>
