        "Location": "The Raven's Eye was situated close to [[Ravens Bluff]]'s protective outer stone wall. The back of the building faced an alley, where trash was strategically piled to ensure it was little trafficked.",
        "Structure": "The tavern was housed in a stout wooden building{{Cite organized play/LC/The Perils of Politics|20}} In addition to the front entrance, the building had an exit in its office and kitchen, the latter of which was aligned with the stairs to the basement.",
        "Atmosphere": "The business primarily catered to sailors and [[rogue]]s. It was considered rather standard as far as taverns went around Ravens bluff, but was always full of customers. Patrons could often be found playing card games or [[dart]]s.",
        "Activities": "Under its third owner the Raven's Eye was used as the center for a fencing and smuggling operation, a forgery racket, as well as a safehouse for wanted criminals. The criminals were mostly confined to the inn's basement in order to avoid detection, whilst its wanted \"guests\". Those wishing to conduct illicit business with the owner usually entered from the back entrance.",
        "Inhabitants": "The tavern was first owned and operated by [[Gov Landrum]],''The Perils of Politics'' makes reference to the events of the module ''[[Counterfeit Dreams]]'', stating they took place five years ago. That module has been estimated to take place in 1355 DR, based on the ages given therein of Lord [[Charles Blacktree]] and [[Vernon Condor]].\n\nVerity employed a number of tavern wenches, all attractive and buxom, as well as a watchmen who stood guard on the second floor, watching out from a boarded-up window.",
        "History": "On a foggy night around the spring or fall season of the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, a group of [[human]] hooligans posing as members of the [[Night Watch]] were trying to press a protection racket on Landrum, demanding he pay them 40 [[silver piece]]s. Luckily for Landrum, actual members of the Night Watch arrived on the scene alongside [[vampire]] hunter [[Jack Harker]] and chased off the imposters.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, a group of [[fire]] worshipers emerged in Crow's Foot{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|14}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"date1\">''Inferno in the Living City'' makes some references to the events of ''Nightwatch in the Living City'', referring to them as having happened four years prior. As that module has been estimated to be set in [[1355 DR]], that would place the events of ''Inferno'' in 1359 DR. called the [[Cult of Red Ruin]] and established [[Temple of Red Ruin|a temple]] close to the tavern. Its members frequented the Red Sail Inn quite often, giving Landrum the impression that their cult was an excuse to party.\n\nSometime later that year the cult found and trapped within an ''[[iron flask]]'' a [[pyre elemental]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|6-7}} Over the next two weeks the cultists caused several fires in Ravens Bluff,{{Cite organized play/LC/Inferno in the Living City|13}} A group of volunteer members of the city's firefighting service, the [[Red Ravens (Ravens Bluff)|Red Ravens]], later stopped by the Red Sail Inn on the night of the fires just as four members of the Cult of Red Ruin were stopping by to pick up eight bottles of [[wine]] for their evening services. The cultists would leave the establishment at around 11 and a half [[Bell (time)|bells]].\n\nIn 1360 DR, Gov Landrum suddenly had to leave Crow's Foot in a hurry and sold the Red Sail Inn to an old fisherman who renamed it \"The Bloated Crab\". Business floundered under the fisherman and it was not long before Verity Overinn convinced him to sell the building to her. She would go on to change the name to \"The Raven's Eye\" and start using it as a base for various criminal operations.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"date2\" />"
