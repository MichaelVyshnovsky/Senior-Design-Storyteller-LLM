The marble was stained with red rust to appear like blood. Each pillar of the mosque was woven with lines of red. \nAll of the priests inhabiting the Shrine of the Scimitar were outspoken Moralists who defended the various mamluk societies of Zakhara.\nThis mosque was rumored to house spies from Qudra."
