        "mainbody": "The Green Door, popularized as simply the Door, was an inn and festhall in Essembra, Battledale, in the midâ€“14 century DR, which also concealed a shrine to the forest goddess Mielikki.\nThe Door was located on the east side of Rauthauvyrs Road just north of Battle Court and the Silver Taproom.\nThe Green Door had a green-painted front entry door that most believed gave the inn its name.\nReflecting its name, the Green Door had wall tapestries displaying splendid forest scenes throughout the building. It was clean and simply furnished.\nThere was no common dining hall or taproom, but there were harping chambers on each floor at the hearth end for patrons to meet and talk in.\nThe Door was once the most riotous and notorious festhall in the Dales, until Lashan Aumersair of Scardale occupied Essembra and ordered troops to murder its ladies, after which it became officially just an inn.\nIn the 1360s DR, the Door was a place of pilgrimage for followers of Mielikki because it was the site of a pool of special waters, preserved in a wooded, backyard bower. The pool was the real \"Green Door\", whose tranquil waters held visions from Mielikki to her faithful.\nFollowers of Mielikki believed this is where their deity appeared in person to Florin Falconhand."
