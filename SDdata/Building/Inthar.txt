'''Inthar''' was a ruined fortress whose origins were unknown and that was avoided by almost all sailors.

==Location==
This fortress sat atop a rocky sea crag, It was roughly {{SI|35|miles|long=yes}} south of the ruined fortress [[Rethgaard]].

==Structure==
During the night time, eerie green lights would shine within this fortress, silhouetting shadowy shapes, and faint whispers could be heard from afar.

==History==
Some time prior to [[1361 DR]], an [[illithid]] named [[Vestress]] banished a [[drow]] [[banshee]] in [[Ascarle]] to this fortress by means of a portal. 

==Rumors & Legends==
Some tales spoke of there being a hidden shaft within the fortress that led straight down to [[Baator]].
