Inthar was a ruined fortress whose origins were unknown and that was avoided by almost all sailors.
This fortress sat atop a rocky sea crag, It was roughly  south of the ruined fortress Rethgaard.
During the night time, eerie green lights would shine within this fortress, silhouetting shadowy shapes, and faint whispers could be heard from afar.
Some time prior to 1361 DR, an illithid named Vestress banished a drow banshee in Ascarle to this fortress by means of a portal. 
Some tales spoke of there being a hidden shaft within the fortress that led straight down to Baator.
