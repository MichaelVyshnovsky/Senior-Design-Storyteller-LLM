Morningdawn Hall was a temple to Lathander in the town of Shadowdale in Shadowdale in the mid–14 century DR. It was shaped like a phoenix.
The temple was built in the shape of a phoenix, with each stone wing curving up to form two towers on either side of its double-door entrance.
For a time in the mid—14 century, temple services were led by High Morninglord Rewel Thunderstorm. During his tenure he was served by seven lesser priests.
During the Time of Troubles in the , the sage of Shadowdale Elminster took the young magic-user Midnight to the temple, in order to complete a ritual that would bring forth the Eye of Eternity. Due to the instability of the Weave he inadvertently opened a portal to the plane of Gehenna. Meanwhile, the avatar of the god Bane and an elemental form of Mystra fought a terrible battle at the temple, as Elminster attempted to close the otherworldly rift. As the Celestial Stairway opened up above them, Bane was destroyed, Elminster dove through the portal to close it from the other side, and Morningdawn Hall was leveled in the ensuing explosion.
Years later, after the Zhentarim invasion in Hammer of the , Morningdawn Hall destroyed for the second time, this time in a great fire. The clergy of Lathander were all killed or forced to flee the village of Shadowdale.
