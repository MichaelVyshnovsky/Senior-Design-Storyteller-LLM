The Theater of Joy was an old amphitheater complex repurposed as a temple dedicated to Lliira, Milil and Sune, located in the Crimmor.
The temple was built on the street known as The Dausann, and was located next to the southern city walls.The temple is explicitly referred as being on the north end of the city, but all published maps contradicts that information.
The temple is composed of an amphitheater used for services, and of a smaller building storing divine reliquaries.
By tradition and mutual agreements, the three clergies sharing the temple didnt officiate simultaneously.
* From dawn until highsun, the temple held services dedicated to Sune.
* From highsun until dusk, services were dedicated to Milil, including concerts.
* At night, the temple was dedicated to Lliira.
At special occasions, such as when caravanning season began, the temple held huge parties dedicated to Waukeen in addition to its three regular deities. On such occasions, Lliira aspect as the Regent of the Merchants Friend was celebrated.
The amphitheater was built by the Shoon Imperium.
The temple was inhabited by many priests
* Chynna Crytrapper, a priestess of Lliira.
* Tahrun and Shyrros Harpson, respectively bard and cleric, followers of Milil.
* Raven Sommersrace, a charismatic priestess of Sune.
