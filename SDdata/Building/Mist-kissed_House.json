        "mainbody": "ist-kissed House was an inn and festhall located in Suldolphor in far eastern Calimshan in the late 14 century DR.\nThe inn was located in the north section of Suldolphor along the perimeter wall.\nAppearing from the outside to be a simple home of modest decoration, the Mist-kissed House was actually a series of six joined homes that provided discretion for patrons.\nThe staff used secret passages to complete their duties in silence without disrupting guests. A doppelganger was kept on staff who, for an additional fee, could impersonate anyone a client desired."
