        "mainbody": "'''Hasklar's Arms & Armor''' was a shop in [[Yartar]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] that offered perhaps the highest–quality and most expensive [[armor]] in all of [[the North]]. It was run by [[Hasklar]].",
        "Services": "Hasklar's Arms & Armor boasted a wide variety of armaments, that came in many shapes and sizes. The prices were as expensive as any others found throughout the [[Sword Coast North]].\n\nUnlike some other armorers, Hasklar was not a smith and sold his wares \"as is\". He could not offer any wearer-specific modifications or alterations.\n\nAmong the items for sale were:\n* [[Throwing dagger]]s that could be uniquely joined together in pairs – 6 [[gp]] apiece\n* [[Buckler]]s with a removable center that could be placed over the grip of a [[lance]] – 1 gp\n* [[Gorget]]s with a small interior pouch – 4 gp",
        "Defenses": "The shop was well-protected by what appeared to be two animated weapons, that were diligent in their pursuit of shoplifters. In fact, these weapons were wielded by the [[watchghost]] that was dedicated to Hasklar, along with several other [[undead]] [[spirit]]s."
