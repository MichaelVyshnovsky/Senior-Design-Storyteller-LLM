'''The Master's Voice''' was a tavern that once stood in the town of [[Y没lash]] in the [[Moonsea]] region, ruined by [[1357 DR]].

==Location==
The Master's Voice stood at the heart of the ruined Y没lash with an occupying force of the [[Red Plumes]]' checkpoint to the northwest, stables across the street to the north, and a bakery next door to the east.

==History==
After the ruination of Y没lash, The Master's Voice only suggested its previous use through remnants of a bar and copious broken glass and pottery across its taproom. A sign outside read: "The Master's Voice, A Drinking Establishment of Quality." In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, an occasional Red Plume mercenary from the nearby checkpoint snuck into the Master's Voice for an unauthorized nap.
