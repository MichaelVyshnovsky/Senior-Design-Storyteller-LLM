The Hammer and Shield Inn stood at the central square of Thundertree, a logging community at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood in the late 14 century DR.
The establishment was frequented by Thundertree woodsmen and barge captains who transported lumber down the Neverwinter River.
The Hammer and Shield Inn offered a good meal and a good nights rest.
