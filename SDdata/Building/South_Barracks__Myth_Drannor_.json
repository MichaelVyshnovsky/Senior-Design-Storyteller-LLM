        "mainbody": "he South Barracks of Myth Drannor was a simple auxiliary structure of the Castle Cormanthor, located to the west from castle walls across the Street of the Evening Star.\nthumb|The layout of the South Barracks and its basement level.\nSouth Barracks was a small but sturdy stone building with just one floor and one basement level. The entryway was a heavy wooden double door.\nThe entryway was a small room, once decorated with dwarven furniture. To the west from the entry was a small office of the garrisons commanding officer. The main and the biggest part of the structure was the main barracks, an open floor with numerous guard beds, each had a chest for a guards personal belongings. The southern wall of the barracks had a small shelf-filled storage closet with the stairs leading down to the cellar right next to it.\nThe basement level had a big open floor plan, similar to the barracks area of the main floor. A wooden trapdoor in the north-western corner opened into the underground passage that led to Lyssics Crypt in Polyandrium. The door was barricaded by furniture and hidden from the casual eye and nailed shut. The basement was used for storage and had a strong mildew smell. The floor was littered with ale casks, boxes of leathers, and cloth.\nFollowing the ransacking and destruction of the city, the barracks doors were broken open, the interior was ransacked. The building was filled with broken furniture, graffitis, ancient guard documents, broken armor, and several dead dwarven skeletons.\nBefore the destruction of the Weeping War, the Southern Barracks housed the human troops under Commander Lyssic, a human hero of the City of Song. When Lyssic perished in battle and was laid to rest within Lyssics Crypt in Polyandrium, a rumor emerged among the AkhVelahr that the Commander was to one day return from the dead to defend Myth Drannor. With that legend in mind, his followers built a secret passage from the South Barracks to the heros crypt in Polyandrium. In the century that followed, the legend and the passage were both forgotten while the South Barracks were given to dwarven troops who thought the Lyssic return legend did not hold much water. The dwarves boarded up the passage to Lyssics Crypt. Because of that, the tunnels remained undiscovered during the looting and destruction of the city by the Army of Darkness.\nThe South Barracks tunnel remained undiscovered until 1369 DR. A group of adventurers ventured into the ruins of Myth Drannor in search of enslaved villagers and faced the Cult of the Dragon that was occupying the City of Song. With guidance from baelnorn Molostroi, the heroes were able to bypass garrisons and patrols of the Cilt moving undetected from Polyandrium to the Street of the Evening Star."
