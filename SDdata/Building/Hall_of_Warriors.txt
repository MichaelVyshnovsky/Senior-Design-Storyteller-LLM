The '''Hall of Warriors''' was a temple in [[Luskan]] dedicated to the worship of [[Tempus]].

==Location==
This temple stood on [[Aldever's Street]], across from the [[Captains' Court]].

==Activities==
The entrance of this temple was regularly guarded by Luskanite soldiers standing outside of it. Additionally, whenever the city-state went to war its soldiers were forced to march in formation to this temple to make prayer towards Tempus. Though the [[deity]] himself was displeased by such enforced worship and thus asked for pricey offerings in return.

==Rumors & Legends==
This temple regularly suffered an occasional burglary, something that was widely rumored among Luskan's citizens to be the doings of the local [[High Captains of Luskan|High Captains]] in an effort to reap back some of their offerings to the temple, which they were said to then offer back to the temple. The [[wizard]] [[Elminster]] also claimed that these rumors were true.
