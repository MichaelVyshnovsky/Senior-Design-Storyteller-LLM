        "mainbody": "he Merchants Home was a caravanserai located in Huzuz in 1367 DR.\nThe Merchants Home was regarded by many as being the finest caravanserai in all of Golden Huzuz.\nThis five-story structure held a paved central court.\nDue to its reputation, reservation for lodging at the Merchants Home needed to be made at least a year in advance. Several upstanding merchants held regular rooms here.\nThe Merchants Home often hired famous entertainers and even a skilled illusionist to dazzle their patrons.\nBarbers and rawuns could find gainful employment here since the proprietor was always looking to extend the comfort level of his guests.\nThough all caravanserai boasted that they offered everything a caravan needed, none could fulfil that promise compared to the Merchants Home. In addition to offering fine dining, splendid lodging, and grand entertainment, the Merchants Home could enlist outside help for fulfilling needs such as acquiring new horses or even hiring mercenaries or adventurers as caravan guards.\nTun Hayal owned the Merchants Home. His assistant, Gaitiyah al-Aranib handled the daily workings of the establishment."
