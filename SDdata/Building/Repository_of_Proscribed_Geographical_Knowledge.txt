The Repository of Proscribed Geographical Knowledge was located in the Potala in Saikhoi in the midâ€“14 century DR.
All of the volumes and scrolls found within this library were related to geography. A monk controlled access.
In 1360 DR, adventurers seeking information on the city of Solon were directed here. They had to convince the duty monk they had a real need before being permitted to examine a book about it.
