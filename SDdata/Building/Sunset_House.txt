'''Sunset House''' was a strange house located in the city of [[Zhentil Keep]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
The house was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the [[Zhentil Keep/Foreign Quarter|Foreign Quarter]] right next to the [[South Cemetery]]. 

==Description==
Stone [[gargoyle]]s sat atop the roof of Sunset House. All of the windows were covered with heavy black drapes for privacy.

==Interior==
A secret passage in the cellar connected to ancient ruins located beneath Zhentil Keep, which in turn connected to tunnels in the [[Underdark]].

==Defenses==
A ''[[glyph of warding]]'' sealed all of the doors and windows of Sunset House. It would trigger when any non-[[drow]] attempted to enter and turn them to stone.

==Inhabitants==
A group of drow from [[House Mizzrym]] dwelled within Sunset House following the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. Only Lord [[Orgauth]] and the clergy of [[Loviatar]] knew of their presence in the city. Lord Orgauth, who, unbeknownst to the drow, was actually a [[pit fiend]] in disguise at this time, sold undesirables as slaves to the dark elves. [[Kebella Mizzrym]] led the drow stationed here. A [[sorcerer]] named [[Taybar Rozziss]] and a [[mind flayer]] named [[Xog]] aided her.
