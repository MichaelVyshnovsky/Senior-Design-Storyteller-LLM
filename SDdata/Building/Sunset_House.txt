Sunset House was a strange house located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The house was located in south Zhentil Keep in the eastern section of the Foreign Quarter right next to the South Cemetery. 
Stone gargoyles sat atop the roof of Sunset House. All of the windows were covered with heavy black drapes for privacy.
A secret passage in the cellar connected to ancient ruins located beneath Zhentil Keep, which in turn connected to tunnels in the Underdark.
A glyph of warding sealed all of the doors and windows of Sunset House. It would trigger when any non-drow attempted to enter and turn them to stone.
A group of drow from House Mizzrym dwelled within Sunset House following the destruction of Zhentil Keep in the . Only Lord Orgauth and the clergy of Loviatar knew of their presence in the city. Lord Orgauth, who, unbeknownst to the drow, was actually a pit fiend in disguise at this time, sold undesirables as slaves to the dark elves. Kebella Mizzrym led the drow stationed here. A sorcerer named Taybar Rozziss and a mind flayer named Xog aided her.
