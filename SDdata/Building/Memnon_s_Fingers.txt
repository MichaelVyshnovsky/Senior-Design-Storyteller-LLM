Memnons FingersThe name of the hall presumably is a reference to an efreetis hands, which are able to produce flames. (Memnon was an infamous efreeti in Calishite history.) was the guildhall of the Illuminated Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters of Calimport.
This guildhall was located in Jhalal Drudach, in Jhaapir Sabban of Quill Ward.
The building was notable for its unique construction. It was pentagonal, with a four-story minaret at each of its five corners. The minarets were glazed in an off-white color with patterns in the brick to make them appear like candles. The tops of the "candles" contained everburning flames.
