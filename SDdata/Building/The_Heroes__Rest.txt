The Heroes Rest, which was also called the Rest
The inn was located in central Zhentil Keep within the southeast section of the Inner Quarter.
The Heroes Rest was a noisy place but quite comfortable if you could get past all the raucous. The interior accommodations were good and pricing was moderate. The inn was owned by the Zhentarim who made notes of anyone passing through the establishment.
