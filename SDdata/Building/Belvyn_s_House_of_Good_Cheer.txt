'''Belvyn's House of Good Cheer''' was a combined [[festhall]], all-faiths temple, and rental hall in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was owned and rented out by [[Belvyn]].

==Location==
It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the central northern side between [[Tabra's]] and [[Shondrin's Packsack of Plenty]] on the street known as the Rise.<ref><ref>

==Structure==
The building was a tall and slender hall, with a steep roof. The layout was simple and open. Along its high crossbeams ran catwalk galleries.

==Services==
The hall was available to hire for 25 [[gp]] for a night. Typically, it was used as either a festhall or a temple, as incongruous as those might seem. For the former, the hall was hired for revels by a variety of organizations, usually mercantile leagues, the [[guilds of Waterdeep]] getting out of the city, and [[adventuring companies]] passing through and look to celebrate some victory. Such groups regularly hired many of the escorts from the neighboring Tabra's for the evening.

If hired as temple, then worshipers were provided with a plain altar and [[brazier]]s if required. Any non-violent religion was permitted, as well as those of [[Helm]] and [[Tempus]], while that of [[Malar]] was expressed excluded.

Free of charge, one could also hold a funeral here.

==Rumors & Legends==
A recurring rumor in the area claimed that, hidden somewhere within or beneath the House of Good Cheer, were many chests filled with [[gold piece]]s. This was easily discredited, however: the building had no hiding places and not an errant [[copper piece]] was ever turned up.
