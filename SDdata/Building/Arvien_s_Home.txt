Arviens Home in Ashabenford was a building on the north side of town from which the towns tinsmith and pewterer, Arvien Blackhair, ran her business in the 14 century DR.
She worked out of the back rooms of her house and created high-quality items for a hefty price. Arvien specialized in crafting a large number of the same, identical items, a feat which required no small amount of skill. For example, she made dozens of matching beer steins all engraved with the coat-of-arms of the establishment for which they were ordered.
The parlor of Arviens home was used to showcase her work and would attract many passersby to stop, enter, and admire her works. She would offer them tea and/or wine while they examined the masterfully crafted goblets, dishes, bells, spice dishes and other finished goods she had on display.
