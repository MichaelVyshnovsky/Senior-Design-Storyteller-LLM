'''Arvien's Home''' in [[Ashabenford]] was a building on the north side of town from which the town's [[tin]]smith and [[pewter]]er, [[Arvien Blackhair]], ran her business in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3800 Ashabenford}}

==Services==
She worked out of the back rooms of her house and created high-quality items for a hefty price. Arvien specialized in crafting a large number of the same, identical items, a feat which required no small amount of skill. For example, she made dozens of matching beer [[stein]]s all engraved with the coat-of-arms of the establishment for which they were ordered.

The parlor of Arvien's home was used to showcase her work and would attract many passersby to stop, enter, and admire her works. She would offer them [[tea]] and/or [[wine]] while they examined the masterfully crafted [[goblet]]s, dishes, [[bell]]s, [[spice]] dishes and other finished goods she had on display.
