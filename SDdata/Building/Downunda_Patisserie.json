Jemima also didn't like [[adventurer]]s, so any customer who stood out as one was served politely and swiftly, so they could be out of the store sooner. Later, it was only \"the adventuring type\" that she worried about.\n\nRegardless, the Downunda Patisserie was one of the most popular places to visit for Ravenians from outside the Burnt Gables neighborhood.

Derek and Allison, the older children, were kept busy helping their mother in the business by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy,\n\nBy 1370 DR, Jemima had recently hired members of the neighboring Lontle family to run errands buying and fetching ingredients such as flour, [[fruit]]s, nuts, and sundry seasonings.

She would say nothing about where she'd come from, why she'd left, and especially where her husband was. If it wasn't baking, it wasn't anyone's business.\n\nThe bakery was opened around [[1364 DR]].\n\nJemima was once commissioned by a great [[wizard]] to bake an anniversary cake the likes of which had never before been seen in Ravens Bluff, and would never be seen there again. She did so with expert skill and the wizard gave her the magical oven, on the provision that she never make that cake again.\n\nDuring [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s war in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, raids on barges on the [[River Vesper]] interrupted goods getting into Ravens Bluff.
