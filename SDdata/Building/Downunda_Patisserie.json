        "mainbody": "he Downunda Patisserie, also written as the Downunder Patisserie, created grand cakes for the citys rich and powerful, and on two separate occasions was visited by planar beings.\nIt stood in the Burnt Gables neighborhood of the Crows End district of Ravens Bluff, on the corner of Khalamongre Street and Jossil Street. It was a middle-class business area, and nearer the upper-class area than the poor area.\nThe stone building was L-shaped, with the end of the long arm of the L facing the street with the shopfront. It had two stories, with the ground floor given over to the business and upper floor used as a family home. Sweet smells emanated from it throughout the day.\nThe ground floor had three main sections. The front of the building was the store and was open to the public. Here, an L-shaped counter ringed the room with large glass cabinets displaying the days wares\nBehind the kitchen, in the other arm of the L, was the familys private dining room and stairs up. Upstairs was a living room,\nAll were welcome in the Downunda Patisserie, but some more than others received especially polite and personal attention. That is, Jemima worried halflings would be too tempted by her baked goods and shoplift them when she wasnt looking, so she and her children made sure to attend to them personally and politely the whole time they were present. Jemima also didnt like adventurers, so any customer who stood out as one was served politely and swiftly, so they could be out of the store sooner. Later, it was only \"the adventuring type\" that she worried about.\nRegardless, the Downunda Patisserie was one of the most popular places to visit for Ravenians from outside the Burnt Gables neighborhood. City Watch officers making their rounds there always made sure to visit.\nThe Downunda Patisserie sold fresh breads, sweet breads, pastries, pies, tarts, cookies, hand cakes, and large high-quality cakes for special occasions. The other baked goods were only a little less popular. By closing time, the shelves were bare, leading some to affectionately call Jemima \"Mother Hubbard\" after a nursery rhyme from another world. There was typically a stock of one to four dozen of each item available.\nMany of the wealthier citizens of Ravens Bluff preferred to have Jemima Chisolm prepare grand cakes for their special occasions instead of relying on their own kitchen staff. They paid handsomely for her cakes, enough to put her youngest child through school and supply her with magical enhancements to her business.\nIt was rumored that Jemima regularly baked extra batches of cakes and delivered them to poorer parts of Ravens Bluff true or not, she was well known there, despite the fact that her wares were too expensive for poor folk.\nThe store opened just before dawn and closed at dusk.\nThe standard wares were as follows\nBreads\n Cheese loaves 1 gp\n Wholemeal loaves 7 sp\n Kibble loaves 10 sp\nSmall cakes\n Fruit slices, with apple, cherry, or apricot 2 sp\n Cup cakes 1 sp\n Cream puffs 3 sp\n Rock cakes, designed for dwarves 1 sp\n Mini sponges, designed for elves 2 sp\nLarge cakes\n Banana and walnut (when in season) 1 gp\n Orange or chocolate 15 sp\n With cream 1 gp\n Black forest 30 sp\nOn her whims, Jemima made batches of other cakes, like rock cakes with icing made from dwarven spirits, costing 3 gp, or sponge cakes with essence of pine. Such specials were sold out within the hour. She also took special orders, with prices starting at 10 gp and with no limit but the clients purse.\nThe Sixth Anniversary Specials in 1370 DR were\nBreads\n Loaf of cinnamon raisin bread, pre-sliced 1 cp\n Loaf of orange-pineapple bread with powder sugar 1 sp\n Loaf of butter-glazed peach bread with preserves glaze 2 sp\n Loaf of dark wheat bread with vanilla icing 4 sp\nCookies\n Sugar cookies shaped like vultures with candy eyes 6 sp for 1 dozen\n Frosted sugar cookies shaped like lighthouses 5 sp for 1 dozen\n Molasses and sugar cookies shaped like ravens 4 sp for 1 dozen\n Frosted sugar cookies shaped like farm animals 5 sp for 1 dozen\n Spice cookies decorated and shaped like shields 1 gp for 1 dozen\n Orange-almond cookies shaped like roosters 4 sp for 1 dozen\nCupcakes\n Pumpkin cupcakes, iced with orange sprinkles 4 cp for half a dozen\n Big chocolate cupcake with buttercream icing 1 cp\n Big golden cupcake with chocolate icing 1 cp\n Big vanilla cupcake with cherry-marshmallow icing 1 cp\nCakes\n Chocolate layer cake with wild cherry filling 2 gp\n Vanilla layer cake with pale blue buttercream icing 3 gp\n Five-layer black forest cake with rum-soaked cherries 7 gp\n Lemon chiffon cake with lemon-strawberry glaze 1 gp\nPies\n Giant-sized red-hot apple cream crumb pie 9 gp\n Cherry-walnut pie with banana and sugar glaze 6 sp\nMiscellaneous\n City Watch Apple and Berry Donut Delights 3 sp for 1 dozen\n Chocolate-covered strawberries 2 gp for a box of 36\n Chocolate-covered peanut and almond clusters 5 gp for a box of 48\n Cinnamon rolls with raisins and pecans 1 sp for half a dozen\n Cream cheese rolls with blueberry centers 4 sp for half a dozen\nDrinks\n Momma Dorsettis spiced apple cider 3 cp for a  jug\n Downunders Finest black cherry cider 1 gp for a  jug\n Pineapple-orange-banana juice 1 sp for a  jug\nThe Summer Specials in 1372 DR were\nBars\n Almond bars 3 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Raspberry frosted bars 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\nCookies\n Coconut creme cookies 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Strawberry-almond cookies 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\n Mint and green apple cookies 5 cp for one, 3 sp for a dozen\n Summer sugar cookies 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\n Date and raisin cookies 3 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Sugar wheel cookies 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Brandy spice cookies 3 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Grape pinwheel cookies 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\nDonuts\n Cherry donuts 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Blueberry donuts 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Apple-spice donuts 2 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Powder-sugared donuts 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n City Watch cinnamon donuts 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\n OKanes Favorite Donuts 3 sp for one, 3 gp for a dozen\nMiscellaneous\n Glazed large strawberries 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Sugared melon slices 2 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Walnut-apple roll-up 1 cp for one, 1 sp for a dozen\n Procampurian lime roll-up 2 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Cinnamon-peach cupcakes 2 cp for one, 2 sp for a dozen\n Walnut-lemon-spice cupcakes 1 sp for one, 1 gp for a dozen\nThe storage room was protected by a glyph of warding that affected trespassers with a charm person spell that made them leave the store and immediately turn themselves in to Ravens Bluffs Chief Constable of the City Watch, who was Rolf Sunriver around 1370 DR. Only Jemima and Derek knew the key to bypassing the glyph. This security measure was installed by a friendly cleric as payment for a birthday cake for her bishop.\nThe Downunda Patisserie was owned and run by Jemima Chisolm, who was becoming renowned for her culinary talents. She lived above the store with her three children, Derek, Allison, and Karl. Derek and Allison, the older children, were kept busy helping their mother in the business by putting out and selling goods and working second shifts at the ovens, and running the store when Jemima was busy,\nBy 1370 DR, Jemima had recently hired members of the neighboring Lontle family to run errands buying and fetching ingredients such as flour, fruits, nuts, and sundry seasonings. Around that time, a girl named Sulene also worked the counter.\nJemima Chisolm and her three children arrived in Ravens Bluff. She had but one item of value in her possession, a gem, which she would use to purchase the shop. She would say nothing about where shed come from, why shed left, and especially where her husband was. If it wasnt baking, it wasnt anyones business.\nThe bakery was opened around 1364 DR.\nJemima was once commissioned by a great wizard to bake an anniversary cake the likes of which had never before been seen in Ravens Bluff, and would never be seen there again. She did so with expert skill and the wizard gave her the magical oven, on the provision that she never make that cake again.\nDuring Myrkyssa Jelans war in the , raids on barges on the River Vesper interrupted goods getting into Ravens Bluff. Among other businesses, Dowunder Patisserie lost one crate of sugar,  red sugar,  each of blue and green sugar, 3 crates of flour,  nutmeg,  tumeric,  cinnamon,  vanilla,  lime extract,  cherry juice,  grape juice,  yeast,  baking soda,  baking powder,  sprinkles, and a jar each of anise, butterscotch, licorice, and peppermint, as well as twelve aprons. If anyone returned these, Jemima Chisolm would reward them with six-dozen double-chocolate-chip cookies.\nIn Kythorn of 1370 DR, the store had its Sixth Anniversary Celebration, with many new treats and drinks on sale. One day, whilst heading out of town to deal with kobold bandits, a group of adventurers stopped at the Downunder Patisserie for something to snack on on the way and were served by Sulene. But they were all interrupted by the appearance of Aethalynmur, a winged solar in a loincloth, who sought heroes to liberate Nimbus City in the demi-plane of Arrus. He did not require a cake. Later that year, Mijel Morigan visited to collect an order of two baskets of sweet bread loaves for his wife Jandras restaurant he may have had adventurers in tow. If they mentioned their help in arranging the wedding of famed Vast adventurers Despherion Wolf and Lady Fawn Sweetrose Moonray Thorin, then Jemima would be very interested and, if requested, eagerly baked a black forest chocolate cake as a gift for the couple.\nTwo years later, in Kythorn of the , the Dowunder Patisserie was again having a special event, this time to thank the heroic adventurers of the Living City with a free cup of pink lemonade and piece of sponge cake. The promotion was popular, bringing many adventurers to its door. It also brought the sylph Rahmare, riding a cloud down the street to the amazement of many, as she sought heroes to locate her lost friend Aethalynmur. And maybe some chocolate. and mightve found pastries helpful in bribing the frost giants holding Aethalynmur captive. Later, Aethalynmur would transport his saviors back to the street outside the Dowunder Patisserie, again stunning passersby.\nLater, adventurers were discreetly recruited via Spath Investigations to work for Lady Katharine Blacktree one was given a note requesting them to \"come alone to the entrance of the Downunder Patisserie at sunset.\" before being met an agent and directed elsewhere."
