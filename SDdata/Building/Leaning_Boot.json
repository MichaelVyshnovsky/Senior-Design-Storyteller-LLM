        "mainbody": "The '''Leaning Boot''' was an especially poor-quality tavern found in the city of [[Mulmaster]], that defied the odds by remaining in business for well over a century's time.{{Cite adventurers league/City of Danger|13-15}}",
        "Location": "It could be found within the [[Mulmaster/Docks Quarter|Docks Quarter]] of the city.While it is not explicitly stated this location is found in the [[Mulmaster/Docks Quarter|Docks Quarter]], they are located at or in the docks, which are considered a part of the Docks Quarter.",
        "Structure": "The Leaning Boot was found within the basement of dockside house, accessible by a set of rickety stairs. With no other identifiable markers, the entrance could be found by the old, [[salt]]-worn boot that had been nailed to a wooden post. The building above was an apartment building.",
        "Interior": {
            "Atmosphere": "The inn offered its patrons the unique ambiance that arose from the combination of discreet conversation; the aromatic bouquet of salt water, stale [[ale]], and sea-battered wood, as well the ever-present threat of being stabbed in the arm."
