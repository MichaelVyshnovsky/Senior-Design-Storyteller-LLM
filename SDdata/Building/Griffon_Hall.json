        "Description": "Perhaps the most striking in all of Swordspoint, this four-story hall featured magnificent architecture and decoration, featuring glorious statues of [[griffon]]s along its parapets and main entrance. The front doors were enchanted with a ''[[blade barrier]]'' [[spell]] that would trigger in the case of an open attack.\n\nThe roof of the hall was flat, allowing for the knights to take off and land when mounted atop their griffon steeds. These [[magical beast]]s were stabled in the tree-walled, makeshift-roost that was situated near the landing. Hitching rails and water troughs were readily available for convenient care and tacking."
