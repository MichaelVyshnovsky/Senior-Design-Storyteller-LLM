        "mainbody": "riffon Hall was a grand military hall, located on Griffon Trail in the Swordspoint neighborhood of Ravens Bluff, that served as the home to the Knights of the Griffon. \nPerhaps the most striking in all of Swordspoint, this four-story hall featured magnificent architecture and decoration, featuring glorious statues of griffons along its parapets and main entrance. The front doors were enchanted with a blade barrier spell that would trigger in the case of an open attack.\nThe roof of the hall was flat, allowing for the knights to take off and land when mounted atop their griffon steeds. These magical beasts were stabled in the tree-walled, makeshift-roost that was situated near the landing. Hitching rails and water troughs were readily available for convenient care and tacking."
