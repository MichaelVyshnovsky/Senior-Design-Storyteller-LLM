Derval Ironeater
Dervals Smithy was the most prominent blacksmiths shop found in the town of Daggerford during the 15 century DR. It was originally owned by the towns famous blacksmith, Derval of Clan Ironeater, and was eventually passed down to his grandson Ignal.
The building was located in the towns River Quarter.
While Ignal and his apprentice smiths forged weapons in the style of Derval for private sale, they focused most of their work to aid the town. They made many metal items, such as spear and arrow heads, for use by the Daggerford militia.
Dervals original business in Daggerford was the shop known as Dervals Bright Blade. He was known as the finest smith among those in Daggerford, and the weapons he made were of the finest quality.
At some point, the smithy was relocated from Daggerfords Money Quarter to the River Quarter on the south side of town.
