        "mainbody": "The '''Temple of Talona''' in [[Bezantur]] was a major temple of the goddess [[Talona]] and the headquarters of [[Church of Talona|her church]] in [[Thay]].",
        "Location": "The temple was located on the waterfront in south-central Bezantur, the so-called \"City of a Thousand Temples.\" Appropriately, it was surrounded by other temples, notably the [[Temple of Malar (Bezantur)|Temple of Malar]], the [[Temple of Sune (Bezantur)|Temple of Sune]], the [[Temple of Lliira (Bezantur)|Temple of Lliira]], and the [[Temple of Myrkul (Bezantur)|Temple of Myrkul]].",
        "Structure": "The temple was a short, gray structure built like a fortress.",
        "Activities": "The temple hosted a devoted following. Although Thay was one of the few realms in [[Faer√ªn]] where the worship of Talona was practiced openly, the commonfolk had a complicated relationship with the faith as they mistrusted the goddess while seeking to keep her appeased to prevent the possible outbreak of plague. The Bezantur temple was frequently suspected of being behind poisonings or disease outbreaks, and as such was periodically attacked by local mobs. The temple was known to bribe the city's authorities to stay out of its business and to send [[gnoll]]s to defend the temple when the citizenry attacked it.",
        "History": "Worship of Talona gained popularity in Thay following the [[Great Plague of the Inner Sea]] in the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, as the poor folk of Thay hoped to prevent future outbreaks. By the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, their faith had lapsed into an obligation, and popular among [[assassin]]s, [[noble]]s, and [[merchant]]s.",
        "Inhabitants": "The temple was home to [[priests]] and priestesses who adorned themselves with [[tattoo]]s and scarring and reveled in the suffering of the masses. In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the temple was headed by High Priestess [[Mynnsha]]."
