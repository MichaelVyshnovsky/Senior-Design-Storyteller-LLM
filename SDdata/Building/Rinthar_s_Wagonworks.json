        "mainbody": "'''Rinthar's Wagonworks''' was a workshop in the settlement of [[Bargewright Inn]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was run by the wheelwright [[Rinthar]] and his six apprentices.",
        "Location": "It stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the southern side of the road known as the Back, between the Stalls and [[Halduth Meer]]'s house.<ref><ref>",
        "Services": "A skilled wheelwright, Rinthar was most known for crafting plain sturdy wheels. He would steam and bend [[ash]] wood into shape out in the workshop's yard. These he sold for 15 [[gp]] for one wheel, 25 gp for two.\n\nIn addition, he and his six young apprentices repaired [[wagon]]s, usually to a rough but serviceable quality. A regular repair took about a full day and cost 10 gp for a wagon, while a quick repair could be done by evening or the next morning, but was pricy at 30 gp for a wagon.\n\nMoreover, Rinthar was an expert on wood and could identify even rare or ancient specimens, and furthermore could apply appropriate weatherproofing."
