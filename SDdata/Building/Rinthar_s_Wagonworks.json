        "mainbody": "inthars Wagonworks was a workshop in the settlement of Bargewright Inn in the Savage Frontier in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. It was run by the wheelwright Rinthar and his six apprentices.\nIt stood in the upper part of Bargewright Inn, on the southern side of the road known as the Back, between the Stalls and Halduth Meers house.\nA skilled wheelwright, Rinthar was most known for crafting plain sturdy wheels. He would steam and bend ash wood into shape out in the workshops yard. These he sold for 15 gp for one wheel, 25 gp for two.\nIn addition, he and his six young apprentices repaired wagons, usually to a rough but serviceable quality. A regular repair took about a full day and cost 10 gp for a wagon, while a quick repair could be done by evening or the next morning, but was pricy at 30 gp for a wagon.\nMoreover, Rinthar was an expert on wood and could identify even rare or ancient specimens, and furthermore could apply appropriate weatherproofing."
