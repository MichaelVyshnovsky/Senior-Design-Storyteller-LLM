        "Location": "The castle was built on the island's easternmost cliffs' southern edge.",
        "Structure": "By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tower castle was in ruins and mainly used as shelter by monsters and castaways. Most of its treasured had long been scavenged, but its stone-carved cellar hid secrets. A seemingly endless well shaft descended in a straight fall directly into the [[Underdark]]. It was unknown if the well was used for water by Askalath. If it was, it had to be done via magic. Somewhere in the lower parts of the shaft, one could access many short cellar complexes that his the wizard's treasures.",
        "History": "By the late 14{{th}} century DR, it was widely believed that Askalath's tower was once a pirate stronghold. However, [[Elminster Aumar]] stated that it was home of Askalath, whose corrupted name eventually became the island's name."
