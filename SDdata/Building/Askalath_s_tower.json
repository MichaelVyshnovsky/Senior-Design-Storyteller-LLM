        "mainbody": "castle, tower\nAskalaths tower was a ruined castle once owned by the mage Askalath on the isle of Askalet in Sea of Swords, just off the shores of Candlekeep.\nThe castle was built on the islands easternmost cliffs southern edge.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the tower castle was in ruins and mainly used as shelter by monsters and castaways. Most of its treasured had long been scavenged, but its stone-carved cellar hid secrets. A seemingly endless well shaft descended in a straight fall directly into the Underdark. It was unknown if the well was used for water by Askalath. If it was, it had to be done via magic. Somewhere in the lower parts of the shaft, one could access many short cellar complexes that his the wizards treasures.\nBy the late 14 century DR, it was widely believed that Askalaths tower was once a pirate stronghold. However, Elminster Aumar stated that it was home of Askalath, whose corrupted name eventually became the islands name."
