'''The Tavern O'er the Waters''' was a tavern in [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
Unusually, the tavern was built as a bridge over the [[Delimbiyr River]] itself, with entrances at each end. This made it a handy way of getting around. One end lay near [[The Woodlands Inn]].

==History==
When the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Zhentilar]] commanded by [[Vaalgamon]] invaded the streets of [[Loudwater]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[Heroes of Ascore]] were able to use The Tavern O'er the Waters to get around where they'd blocked the street for an ambush.
