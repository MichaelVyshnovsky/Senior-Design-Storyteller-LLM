        "Location": "It lay near the center of town.",
        "Services": "In the 1480s DR, the store sold foodstuffs, [[fishing rod]]s, [[candle]]s, [[lamp]] [[oil]], sackcloth, [[snowshoes]], [[wagon]] wheels, and everything in between. Despite Targos being a fishing town, it did not sell supplies and equipment for fishing and sailing, which were provided by specialty craftsmen and traders. For anything Triglio didn't have, Jestin could suggest another store."
