'''Talarkgates''' was the manor home of merchant [[Umbran Daerith]] in the city of [[Suzail]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021193611/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_080910-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Aug â€“ Oct 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Description==
The Talarkgates manor was surrounded by a high [[iron]] fence topped with [[spear]]s to dissuade unwanted visitors. Past the fence was a narrow pathway, overgrown with shrubbery, that led towards the main entrance.

==Location==
The manor was built on the western end of the Y-shaped [[Swordstars Lane]], with [[Montalar's Happy House]] being its immediate neighbor to the east and the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]] to the northwest.

==History==
Talarkgates's name came from the manor's first owner and its builder, [[Indrith Talark]], a merchant who ran a small fleet of trade vessels long before Umbran Daerith took residence in the mansion. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Talarkgates was showing signs of age and wear despite still being the grand mansion home of Umbran Daerith. By that time, Umbran had already retired from his merchant business in dealing in [[wool]] and [[ale]]. However, despite his advanced age, he still ran a moneylending business and invested in real estate across Suzail. Umbran rarely left Talarkgates unless leaving to attend a feast in the evenings or having to attend to business in person in the [[Court of Suzail]] or negotiate a deal in one of the many establishments along the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]].

==Inhabitants==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, Umbran still enjoyed the company of beautiful young women he hired as companions every [[tenday]]. Most of the time, the young women served as company and conservationists for the old man, with some of the women allegedly being undercover [[War Wizards]].
