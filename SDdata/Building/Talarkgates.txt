century DRIndrith Talark before the 14 century DR
Talarkgates was the manor home of merchant Umbran Daerith in the city of Suzail in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The Talarkgates manor was surrounded by a high iron fence topped with spears to dissuade unwanted visitors. Past the fence was a narrow pathway, overgrown with shrubbery, that led towards the main entrance.
The manor was built on the western end of the Y-shaped Swordstars Lane, with Montalars Happy House being its immediate neighbor to the east and the Society of Stalwart Adventurers to the northwest.
Talarkgatess name came from the manors first owner and its builder, Indrith Talark, a merchant who ran a small fleet of trade vessels long before Umbran Daerith took residence in the mansion. By the late 15 century DR, Talarkgates was showing signs of age and wear despite still being the grand mansion home of Umbran Daerith. By that time, Umbran had already retired from his merchant business in dealing in wool and ale. However, despite his advanced age, he still ran a moneylending business and invested in real estate across Suzail. Umbran rarely left Talarkgates unless leaving to attend a feast in the evenings or having to attend to business in person in the Court of Suzail or negotiate a deal in one of the many establishments along the Promenade.
In the late 15 century DR, Umbran still enjoyed the company of beautiful young women he hired as companions every tenday. Most of the time, the young women served as company and conservationists for the old man, with some of the women allegedly being undercover War Wizards.
