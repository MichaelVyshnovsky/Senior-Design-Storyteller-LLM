Spire of Stone
Shuldins Stonespire, formerly known as the Spire of Stone, was an inn located in the city of Myth Drannor in the years leading up to the 8 century DR.
It was located on the corner of Phelindra Street and Suldars Walk, in the district of Dlabraddath.
Like many buildings in Myth Drannor, Shuldins Stonespire was partially built within one of the massive trees of Myth Drannor, one that had been petrified, connected to a building of traditional construction built at the citys ground level. The fortified ground structure held the inns cellar, that served as a storeroom and vat storage. 
The Stonespire housed two separate taprooms, one located on the bottom floor of the structure at ground-level and another found nearer the inn rooms in the tree-bough structure. 
Stonespires inn offered rooms for rent while its taprooms provided drinks for its patrons.
