'''Shuldin's Stonespire''', formerly known as the '''Spire of Stone''', was an inn located in the city of [[Myth Drannor]] in the years leading up to the 8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Location==
It was located on the corner of [[Phelindra Street]] and [[Suldar's Walk]], in the district of [[Dlabraddath]].

==Structure==
Like many buildings in Myth Drannor, Shuldin's Stonespire was partially built within one of the massive trees of Myth Drannor, one that had been [[petrified]], connected to a building of traditional construction built at the city's ground level. The fortified ground structure held the inn's cellar, that served as a storeroom and vat storage. 

The Stonespire housed two separate taprooms, one located on the bottom floor of the structure at ground-level and another found nearer the inn rooms in the tree-bough structure. 

==Services==
Stonespire's inn offered rooms for rent while its taprooms provided drinks for its patrons.
