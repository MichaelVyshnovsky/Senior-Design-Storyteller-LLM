'''Jesters' Clubhouse''' was the guildhall of the [[Guilds of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian guild]] known as the [[Jesters' Guild]].

==Location==
Jesters' Clubhouse was located at the corner of [[Pressbow Lane]] and [[Shrimp Alley]],<ref>{{Cite comic/Night of the Moonpenguin|25}} in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Structure==
This guildhall stood only a single story tall.{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|24}}

==History==
In [[1357 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} the group that would later be known as the Jester's Guild robbed the corpse of a [[jester]] from the past century, [[Myyrth]], from the [[Anteos]] family crypt in the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] and brought it to the clubhouse<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|22}} as part of a plot planted in their minds by the [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers|Musicians' Guild]].<ref>{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|15-17}} A plot that their then-guildmaster [[Bazzle]] referred to as the greatest "practical joke" the city had ever seen.

On that same night the jesters went on to confront and knock out the [[heroes of Sel√ªne's Smile]] in the City of the Dead, as they had been looking into their graverobbing on behalf of the [[ghost]] of Myyrth. They then brought the unconscious [[adventurer]]s back to the Jesters' Clubhouse.<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|22}}

In front of the adventurers, the jesters relayed their plans before proceeding to cast a combination of [[spell]]s on Myyrth's corpse,{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|23-24}} One of the jesters then remarked that they probably should have conducted their plan outside of the building, before Myyrth's skeleton walked off and started wreaking havoc in the city.<ref>{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|1-3}}
