        "mainbody": "The Teshford Arms was run by Olavia Tsardruyn and was the only real inn in Dagger Falls.\nWhen the weather was good enough for prospecting, traders from various places around the Moonsea and Dragon Reach took up residence here and bought gems that miners brought out of the Desertsmouth Mountains.\nThe inn suffered from the fact that Olavias mint wine was the only thing to recommend it. There were reports that it improved after the Zhent occupation in 1369 DR, but was rarely full. \nCategoryInns\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in Dagger Falls\nCategoryLocations in Daggerdale\nCategoryLocations in the Dalelands\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations on the Tethyamar Trail\nCategoryLocations in the Eastern Heartlands\nmqcpknfcwd3msfry87s60046yu8knp8"
