        "mainbody": "The '''Dark Weavings Bazaar''' was the marketplace in the [[drow]] city of [[Sshamath]], at the bottom of the cave. In hundreds of tents and small shops in stalagmites, visitors could buy almost everything. If they did not find what they were looking for, they could hire someone to find it for them, even [[human]]s to go search for the item in the world above.\n\nIn the center of the bazaar lay the slave market. In most places such a market would consist of many tents and cages but in a city full of [[wizard]]s it was housed in one building. Magical glyphs on each side tried to encourage passersby to buy one or more slaves. The slaves were magically shrunk and held in magical clearstones, fist-sized cubes that could be easily stored on the shelves."
