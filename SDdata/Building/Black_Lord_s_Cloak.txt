The '''Black Lord's Cloak''', also known as the '''Black Lord's Altar''', was a temple-complex dedicated to [[Bane]] in the city of [[Mourktar]] within the [[Old Empires|Old Empire]] of [[Threskel]].

==Structure==
Even more so than his temples in [[Zhentil Keep]] and [[Mulmaster]], as the [[Moonsea]] region considered the "core region" of the god's faith, the Black Lord's Cloak was the largest and most-influential temple of Bane in all the Realms.

==Interior==
Described as being more of a palace than a traditional temple, the Black Lord's Cloak was the home to the vast riches of Threskel for a time.

==Activities==
Temple leaders sponsored excursions to pillage local ruins for wealth and riches in order to further fill the church's coffers.

For years the Mourktar cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] operated in secret within the ranks of the temple's clergy. While venerating the Dark Lord in one aspect, they also maintained a somewhat strained relationship with the [[church of Tiamat]]. They stressed following the dogma set forth by Bane's head priests, while trying to create new forms of [[undead]] [[draconic]] beings.

==Defenses==
Beyond the temple's massive congregation, the Banite priests commanded a formidable army of loyal Banite templars, equipped with [[magical item|magical]] weapons purchased from [[Thay]]an merchant-wizards.  Beyond their own forces, they also conscripted local adventuring companies such as [[Six Black Blades]] and the [[Crow Banners]] to carry out their grim directives.

==History==
Following the death of King [[Theris]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, along with the collapse of the [[Untheric pantheon]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] that same year, the local priests of Bane came to take over the entire city of Mourktar. Even with the death of Bane's [[avatar]], the faithful of the Black Cloak did not waver in their devotion. This fervent grab for power had the unintended effect of protecting Mourktar and Threskel alike from an invasion from [[Thay]] from across the [[Alamber Sea]]. In fact, Imperceptor Kabbarath believed he could leverage his power to take control of the entire nation of Threskel.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Imperceptor Kabarrath was afflicted with some sort of mental illness that was believed to be caused by the new god [[Cyric]].

Sometime during or before the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the soldiers of the Black Lord's Cloak changed the secondary color of their livery from red to green, hinting at some new association with [[Iyachtu Xvim]], though this wasn't concerned.

In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Mourktar's Banite soldiers were dispatched to [[Messemprar]] to aide in the city's defense against invading [[Mulhorand]]i forces.

==Rumors & Legends==
The temple was named after a holy [[relic]] of Bane that was kept within its walls. A black cloak once word by Bane in his mortal life that could forcibly constrict someone and relieved them of all their blood.
