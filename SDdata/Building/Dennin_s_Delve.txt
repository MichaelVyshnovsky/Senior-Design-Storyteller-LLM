Dennins Delve was an ancient dwarven stronghold found on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
Dennins Delve was located under the Trollclaw Range in northwestern Moray.
The stronghold was utterly destroyed by orcs, trolls, and goblins to the point where little remained of the dwarven stonework. A secret portal was located within the ruins that connected Moray to another portal within the Fairheight Range on Alaron on the other side of the Moonshae Isles. The portal in Dennins Delve was later the lair of a vicious beholder.
