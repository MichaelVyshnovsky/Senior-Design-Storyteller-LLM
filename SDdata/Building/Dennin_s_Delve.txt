'''Dennin's Delve''' was an ancient [[dwarven]] stronghold found on the isle of [[Moray]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles}}

==Geography==
Dennin's Delve was located under the [[Trollclaw Range]] in northwestern Moray.

==History==
The stronghold was utterly destroyed by [[orc]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[goblin]]s to the point where little remained of the dwarven stonework. A secret portal was located within the ruins that connected Moray to another portal within the [[Fairheight Range]] on [[Alaron]] on the other side of the Moonshae Isles. The portal in Dennin's Delve was later the lair of a vicious [[beholder]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|10}}
