The High Axes Hall was a non-denominational temple in Myth Drannor that was dedicated the dwarven gods collectively known as the Morndinsamman.
It was located on the southern edge of Myth Drannors Sheshyrinnam district, at the intersection between the Stroll of Minstrels and Withercloak Street.
The ground floor of the temple held a central place of worship that housed statues of each of the deities of the dwarven pantheon. Beyond this chamber separate chapels for each individual deity, along with an underground cavern for the worship of Dumathoin.
The top two floors housed the clerical rooms and residences for the dwarven priests.
The temple was built out of a renovated villa that once belonged to one of the citys noble families.
