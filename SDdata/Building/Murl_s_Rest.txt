'''Murl's Rest''' was a small strake, or an open plaza, of roughly triangular shape located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]] district of the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] in [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Location==
Murl's Rest stood on the crossing of several major streets: [[Stormshore Street]] came into the strake on the western side, crossed it, and continued in the southeast. On the opposite side of where Stormshore exited the strake, [[Hulkael Street]] ended after reaching Murl's Rest's southern side. And lastly, the [[Old Town Avenue]], that ran parallel a part of Stormshore Street and connected Murl's Rest to another strake just three city blocks south.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Sorcerous Sundries]], a famous shop of magical goods, located on the strake's southwestern corner.
*[[Bonecloak's Apothecary]], a [[potion]]-maker's shop, located across the street from Sorcerous Sundries, run by [[Derryth Bonecloak|Derryth]] and [[Baelen Bonecloak]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
*[[Highberry Home]], the sizable townhome neighboring Bonecloak's Apothecary, home of [[Cora Highberry|Cora]] and [[Roger Highberry]], as well as their adopted children, the site of [[wine]] festivals in the late 15{{th}} century DR.<ref group="note">The game's city map is representative and in no way accurate to the actual layout of Baldur's Gate. This article makes an educated guess that Highberry Home is located on the same plaza as Sorcerous Sundries, both found on the city map. Its position matches the plaza's northwestern block, which is just two buildings: the shop and the spacious Highberry family home.
*[[Keexie Tavern]], A simple tavern and inn that served as a front for Baldur's Gate's thieves' guild in the 14{{th}} century DR, located on the opposite side of the strake from Sorcerous Sundries.
