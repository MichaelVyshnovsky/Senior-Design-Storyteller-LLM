The Guts and Garters was an inn in Skullport.
The inn was located off Illithid Way in the Lower Heart district of Skullport near the Feathered Rat, the Thrown Gauntlet, and the Bindles Blade inn.
In 1370 DR, the Guts and Garters was an inn in fair condition, but the rooms were of poor quality.
In 1492 DR, the inn was in run-down condition, with windows almost opaque with grime.
Around 1370 DR, the inn was owned by Bolton Brimwell, who rented private rooms to those who had coin to spend.
By 1492 DR, it was run by a sullen, soft-spoken tiefling called Quietude and was Skullports last remaining inn. Quietude spied on guests for the Xanathar. The inn contained a secret door leading to a staircase that descended 20 feet to a magically lit rough-hewn tunnel that extended 300 feet west and connected to the Xanathars secret dungeon lair.
Bolton Brimwell provided the following services 
* Rooms per hour at 5 sp
* Rooms for 10 hours at 5 gp
For a few extra coins, Brimwell would show patrons a secret passage to the alley near the Feathered Rat pet shop and provide a guard for added protection. 
* Information on secret passage to alley outside Feathered Rat for 1 gp
* Services of guard for 1 gp
Quietude rented bedrooms for 5 gp per day.
