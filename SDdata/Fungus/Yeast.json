That export was the inspiration behind a common saying \"May your bread be sour, and your salt be fresh.\"{{Cite adventurers league/Breaking Umberlee's Resolve|6}}\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], a drink called [[Abyss' Alive and Kicking]] was made in [[Zelatar]] of [[Azzagrat]]. The dire [[wheat]] brew was made and consumed with living bubbling yeast.\n\nThe [[spell]] ''[[age wine]]'', used in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] required a pinch of yeast as a [[spell component]].{{Cite polyhedron/62/The Living City: As The Vine Twines|16}}",
        "Locations": "The [[Larawkan Lane]] in [[Selgaunt]] had a constant strong aroma of yeast and freshly baked bread. That pleasant aroma also was encountered in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. In the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], yeast was a trade commodity often carried by merchants alongside [[flour]] and [[spice]]s."
