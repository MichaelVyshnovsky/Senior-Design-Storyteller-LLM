'''Trillimac''' was a [[fungus]] that grew in the [[Underdark]], both domesticated{{Cite dragon/211/Fungi of the Underdark|25}} and in the wild.

==Description==
Wild trillimac stalks reached a height of about {{SI|3|ft|c}} while cultivated ones grew around {{SIrange|4|5|ft|long=yes}} tall. The stalks were a light gray color capped with a wide, flat gray-green hood anywhere from {{SIrange|14|33|in|c|long=yes}} across. It was rare to find these mushrooms growing wild near civilized areas, but in remote regions of the Underdark they were merely uncommon and grew in clusters of three to thirty. A fungus farm typically had twenty to fifty specimens.

==Uses==
The stems of the trillimac made a bread-like food once they were cleaned off, soaked in water for one hour, and then allowed to dry by a fire. A single stalk prepared this way yielded about {{SIrange|7|10|lbs|k|long=yes}} of food and sold for about 4 [[gold piece]]s per {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}}. This foodstuff stayed fresh for a whole month.

The cap had a leathery texture that held [[ink]]s and [[dye]]s well. After it was cut and cleaned, the cap of a trillimac could be used to make a map or a scroll. It was also just tough and flexible enough to be made into a hat, but was not appropriate for things that would suffer wear and tear. A square of trillimac cap leather, {{SI|2|ft|c}} on a side, typically sold for 50 gp.

==Trivia==
Trillimacs were sometimes called "corpse caps" because the [[drow]] and the [[derro]] often fertilized their crops with the bodies of dead slaves and fallen enemies. [[Dwarves]] and [[gnomes]] did not follow this practice, but used other waste instead.
