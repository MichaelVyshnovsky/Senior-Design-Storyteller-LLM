'''Acorn truffles''' were edible [[fungi]] found in the [[Underdark]] and damp forests of the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
Acorn truffles were sought after by [[ranger]]s and [[druid]]s. These mushrooms were a delicacy for many forest [[beast]]s.

Found in the [[Underdark]] and forest beds, these mushrooms were valued around 20 [[gold]] pieces per specimen.

==Usages==
These fungi were used to alchemically create the essence of acorn truffle. The substance had a vibrant color and enticing smell. This essence could be mixed with certain types of [[salt]]s to create ''[[potions of animal speaking]]''.
