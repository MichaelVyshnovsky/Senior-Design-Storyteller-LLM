        "mainbody": "Pygmywort fungus was a faerzress-infused mushroom found only in the Whorlstone Tunnels below the duergar city of Gracklstugh.\nPygmywort had a short stem topped by a blue cap with white speckles. Each one grew to only about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall.\nConsuming a pygmywort caused the consumer to be reduced in size by one-half and decrease in weight by one-eighth (as if affected by an reduce spell) for one hour. Consuming more than one of these mushrooms did not cause further decreases in size, but did extend the duration of the affects by another hour each. A few minutes before the effects wore off, the consumer would feel a slight tingling before growing back to normal size.\nThe effects could be reversed by consuming a bigwig mushroom or having an enlarge spell cast upon the affected being.\nPygmywort mushrooms lost their size-changing affects if taken from the Whorlstone Tunnels for more than an hour."
