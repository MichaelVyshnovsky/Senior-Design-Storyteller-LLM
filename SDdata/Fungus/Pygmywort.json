        "mainbody": "'''Pygmywort''' fungus was a ''[[faerzress]]''-infused mushroom found only in the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] below the [[duergar]] city of [[Gracklstugh]].",
        "Description": "Pygmywort had a short stem topped by a blue cap with white speckles. Each one grew to only about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) tall.",
        "Uses": "Consuming a pygmywort caused the consumer to be reduced in size by one-half and decrease in weight by one-eighth (as if affected by an ''[[reduce]]'' spell) for one hour. Consuming more than one of these mushrooms did not cause further decreases in size, but did extend the duration of the affects by another hour each. A few minutes before the effects wore off, the consumer would feel a slight tingling before growing back to normal size.\n\nThe effects could be reversed by consuming a [[bigwig]] mushroom or having an ''[[enlarge]]'' spell cast upon the affected being.\n\nPygmywort mushrooms lost their size-changing affects if taken from the Whorlstone Tunnels for more than an hour."
