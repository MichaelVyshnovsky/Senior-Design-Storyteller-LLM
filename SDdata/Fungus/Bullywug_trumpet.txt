'''Bullywug trumpet''' was a species of edible [[fungus]] that could be found in most dark and moist places.

==Description==
These mushrooms were shaped like trumpets and bluish green in color, expelling their name. They could be found in many subterranean wet locations. These mushrooms were valued at twenty [[gold]] [[coin]]s for a good-sized specimen.

Even though edible, [[bullywug]] trumpets were unappetizing and sour to taste.

==Usages==
A suspension could be extracted from bullywug trumpets through [[alchemy]]. The resulting substance was an acrid tincture that stung eyes if was left uncorked. When mixed with certain types of sublimates, suspension of bullywug trumpet formed a simple [[poison]].
