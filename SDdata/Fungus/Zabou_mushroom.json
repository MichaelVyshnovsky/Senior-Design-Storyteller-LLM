        "Description": "Zabou mushrooms were notorious for releasing poisonous spores when disturbed. Skilled gatherers knew how to handle the fungi, gathering them without triggering the spore release. If agitated, the mushrooms exploded with toxic spores in a radius of {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}}. Creatures that inhaled the spores suffered the poison's effects for up to one minute. As a side-effect, the spores caused itching when they contacted bare skin.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "If gathered with caution, zabou mushrooms could be used as projectile weapons. If hurled at one's enemy, the mushroom exploded with the poisonous spore cloud, akin to a ''[[thunderstone]]'' or a container of ''[[smokepowder]]''.\n\nA carefully harvested specimen was valued at 10 [[gold piece]]s."
