Nightlight was a fungus that grew in the Underdark. It glowed with bioluminescence and was sensitive to being touched by creatures or objects.
Nightlight had tall stalks ranging from five to ten feet (1.5&ndash3 meters) when mature. The tube-like stems glowed with a bright light out to a distance of  and provided dim illumination for another  beyond that. This mushroom was sensitive to touch and would extinguish its glow when first touched by a creature or an object. Touching it again caused the glow to reappear. If the fungi were uprooted, killed, or destroyed, the glow faded away forever after a few seconds.
Nightlight fronds could be used to create alchemical essence of nightlight. That substance, in turn, could be combined with certain types of alchemical suspension to make hearthlight bombs.
In his years before emerging from the Underdark, the famed drow hero Drizzt DoUrden purified nightlight fungi to extract their luminescence.
