'''Nightlight''' was a [[fungus]] that grew in the [[Underdark]]. It glowed with bioluminescence and was sensitive to being touched by creatures or objects.

==Description==
Nightlight had tall stalks ranging from five to ten feet (1.5&ndash;3 meters) when mature. The tube-like stems glowed with a bright light out to a distance of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} and provided dim illumination for another {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} beyond that. This mushroom was sensitive to touch and would extinguish its glow when first touched by a creature or an object. Touching it again caused the glow to reappear. If the fungi were uprooted, killed, or destroyed, the glow faded away forever after a few seconds.

==Usages==
Nightlight fronds could be used to create [[alchemical]] essence of nightlight. That substance, in turn, could be combined with certain types of alchemical suspension to make ''[[hearthlight bomb]]s''.

==History==
In his years before emerging from the [[Underdark]], the famed [[drow]] hero [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] purified nightlight fungi to extract their luminescence.
