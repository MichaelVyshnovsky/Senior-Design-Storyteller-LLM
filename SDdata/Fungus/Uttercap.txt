Uttercaps (or fairy clusters) were a kind of edible mushroom found mainly around Blustich in Cormyr.
Uttercaps were found in clusters of 5â€“8 nut-brown caps about the size of the end-joint of a human thumb, growing from very dark-brown slender stems about the length of a human hand. They tasted similar to roasted almonds, and were fortunately very visually distinct from local poisonous mushrooms.
Uttercaps grew prolifically around Blustich on the Cormyrean coast and were regularly harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with khondyn and thoud mushrooms, particularly before winter.
Uttercaps could be eaten raw, but were also fried in butter or boar fat, and were often eaten as snacks by the children of Blustich as they played outside the village. They were sometimes added to brandy, which imparted a nutty, buttery, near-cinnamon taste to the drink.
