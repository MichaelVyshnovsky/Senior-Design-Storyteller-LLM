'''Torchstalk''' was a fungus that grew in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
The torchstalk mushroom grew to a height of one to two feet (30 to 60 centimeters) and had a flammable, gas-filled orange round cap. Unfortunately, about one in six of these fungi exploded when lit, sending out flaming spores in a ten foot (three meter) radius, pelting all within range. Those that didn't burst ignited like a torch and could be used as such for 24 hours.

The deep-purple colored torchstalk were known to be less volatile and, on occasion, were used as slow-burning torches in the Underdark. Another way of identifying deadly explosive torchstalks was by paying attention to any of their victims' bones scattered nearby.

==Availability==
In [[Gatchorof]] and [[Gracklstugh]], torchstalks were cultivated by the civilized Underdark [[humanoids]], while they grew in the wild throughout the Northern [[Middledark]].
