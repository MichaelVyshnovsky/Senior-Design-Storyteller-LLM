'''Bonecaps''' were species of [[mushroom]]s often found growing on burial grounds.

==Description==
Bonecaps were a brown-grey variety of mushrooms of similar shape to regular [[morel]]s. Bonecaps were foul to taste and very acidic. They thrived on organic rot and decay, often found on the graves and burial sited of decomposing dead creatures.

They were valued at twenty [[gold]] [[coin]]s per mature mushroom.

These fungi could be processed into vitriol of bonecap. When mixed with special types of ash, the vitriol was turned into [[poison]].
