Browncap was a species of edible wild mushroom.
Browncaps were considered to be a staple of dwarven cuisine in the areas where these mushrooms were available. Dwarves served browncaps golden-panned, or fried. According to Elminster, their taste was reminiscent of portobello mushrooms found on Earth.
