        "Description": "Ormu favored warm, moist areas such as steam tunnels and steam vents and grew in mossy patches typically around {{SI|18|sq ft|long=yes}} in size, but could grow up to {{SI|48|sq ft|long=yes}}. It gave off a soft green glow that provided dim illumination in a {{SIAdj|5|ft|long=yes}} radius.",
        "Usage": "Ormu had a powdery surface and [[drow]] women sometimes used this powder as eye shadow (typical price, 5 [[cp]] per [[pouch]]). If harvested and dried, it yielded a phosphorescent powder that could be used to create a glowing pigment. This pigment was used in [[dye]]s for all types of cloth. It could be made into a paint by mixing it with [[glowworm]] juice and was used to make signs and flags that even surface-dwellers could see in the dark (typical price, 6 [[sp]] per jar). With special preparation, it could be made into an [[ink]] for inscribing [[scroll]]s and [[spellbook]]s (typical price, 25 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|ounce}}."
