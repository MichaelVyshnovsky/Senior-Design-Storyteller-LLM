Dragon egg mushrooms were medicinal fungi found in the Underdark.
Dragon egg mushrooms had distinctive patters on their heads that many considered to be beautiful. The mushrooms heads were sprinkled with vividly green dots. Sages speculated of the mushrooms origins, whether they were natural or product of magic.
Healers valued dragon egg mushrooms for their ability to draw out toxins. Smiths found dragon egg mushrooms to be an effective flame retardant and ground the fungi into paste that protected them from burns. Dragon egg mushrooms could be burned into ash, that, when mixed with certain types of salts, could be brewed into an elixir of fire resistance.
