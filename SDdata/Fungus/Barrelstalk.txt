'''Barrelstalk''' was a [[fungus]] that grew in the [[Underdark]], named for its barrel-like shape. 

==Description==
A barrelstalk could grow up to {{SI|8|feet|long=yes}} in height and {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in diameter. but the inside was hollow and could contain about 5 to 8 gallons (19 to 30 liters) of potable water, while the largest specimens could contain as much as 20 to 50 gallons. The inner rings of the barrelstalk were made from an edible pulp. A typical specimen yielded about 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kilograms) of food.

Some reports of this fungus said that it was only edible when young. Once matured (at about ten years of age), it produced spores and the flesh turned black and poisonous, making it useless as a source of food and water.
