'''Nimergan''' was a species of [[fungus]] that grew in the [[Underdark]].{{Cite dragon/211/Fungi of the Underdark|25-26}}

==Description==
Nimergan grew in irregular patches {{SIrange|8|12|ft}} in diameter and only {{SIrange|1|3|in|c}} tall. It resembled a beige, frayed umbrella with dark brown bumps on the stem.

==Uses==
Mature nimergan was sealed into a cask to die. The brown bumps were actually a parasitic fungus that fed upon the stem and fermented into a potent alcohol that could be consumed. Nimergan that was allowed to ferment too long could actually form an alcohol so potent that it could kill.

[[Duergar]] were especially fond of the drink, which was also known as nimergan. They were known to challenge outsiders to a drinking contest of the more potent version of the alcohol. Being more resistant to its effects, the duergar, more often than not, watched as their opponent went into a coma and sometimes died from over-indulgence.

Nimergan was sold for 1 [[electrum]] piece per glass, or 10 [[gold piece]]s per glass for the rarer, but more potent, version.
