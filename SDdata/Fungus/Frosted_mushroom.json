        "mainbody": "rosted mushrooms were a species of blue fungi, always covered in a thin icy layer of frost. These mushrooms were highly sought after for their use in combat and chilling properties.\nThese mushrooms released freezing cold spores when crushed in a burst. When they were used on the battlefield, they could leave targets frost-burned and slowed by the sheer cold released with the spore burst.\nIn the mid-to-late-15 century DR, frosted mushrooms could be purchased from the Mercenary Arms Depot in Neverwinter."
