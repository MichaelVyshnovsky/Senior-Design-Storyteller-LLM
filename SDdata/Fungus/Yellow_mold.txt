'''Yellow molds''' were a relatively common variety of underground [[fungus|fungal]] mold.

==Description==
Specimens of this mold were found to display a wide range of yellow hues, ranging from pale to golden. though far larger patches were known to exist.

==Behavior==
Being a fungus, yellow molds had no intellect. On rare occasions, colonies that grew to encompass at least {{SI|300|sq ft|long=yes}} would begin to form a collective intelligence.

==Biology==
Anything touched one of these molds had the chance of causing a patch to release a cloud of asphyxiating spores, in a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius. Sentient colonies could willingly project a spore cloud from as far away as they could sense a creature.

Yellow mold was very vulnerable to [[fire]], both natural and magical. Both natural and artificial sunlight, such as that produced by the spell ''[[continual light]]'', were known to drive yellow mold into a dormant state. In some cases, sunlight could outright destroy a patch of it.
===Senses===
Yellow mold colonies that had obtained a form of collective intelligence could sense creatures from varying degrees of distance, typically from {{SIrange|10|60|ft|long=yes}}.

==Abilities==
Yellow mold colonies that obtained collective intelligence displayed a number of unique abilities. They had a [[psionic sense]], allowing them to detect the use of [[psionics|psionic abilities]] at varying degrees, typically in a range of {{SIrange|20|120|ft|long=yes}}.

Twice per day they could psionically compel other creatures in a manner similar to the spell ''[[suggestion]]'', except those affected had a chance of being permanently drained of a small degree of their intellect. These yellow mold colonies also possessed the telepathic abilities of [[mindwipe]] and [[id insinuation]]. Scholars once believed that these colonies needed to rest for one to four days after using their psionic abilities before they could employ them again.

Yellow mold colonies could not be attacked psionically unless there were a third-party, such as a [[cleric]], who could telepathically communicate with plants. Said party was needed to channel psionic attacks into a form that could affect the colony's vegetable intelligence.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], yellow molds were one of the many fungal exports of the [[drow]] city of [[Ched Nasad]].

In [[1372 DR]], yellow mold could be found infesting the crypts of [[Dordrien]]..

==Variants==
A "golden mold" of the exact same hue as [[gold]] dwelt in a ruined temple in [[Myshella]]. This was in spite of a [[phaerimm]] ''[[lifedrain]]'' effect operating constantly, but it otherwise acted exactly the same as a normal yellow mold.{{Cite polyhedron UK/2/Just Deserts - Part 2|14}}

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
These creatures were typically found underground, Two such places were the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] beneath [[Gracklstugh]] and the Undermoor, the Underdark reaches beneath [[High Moor]].

Yellow mold could also be found growing in the [[sewers of Mulmaster]], the [[sewers of Waterdeep]], and in some of the many dungeons scattered throughout [[Kara-Tur]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], some encountered yellow mold growing in the land of [[Barovia]] and some parts of the [[Abyss]]. Especially those ruled over by the [[demon lord]] [[Zuggtmoy]] and [[Ghaunadaur]]'s aspect Jubilex. Such as [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]].

===Usages===
Some creatures would hide yellow mold inside a sack to act as a form of trap.

Some [[lich]]es would grow patches of yellow mold in the entrances of their secret lairs to act as a first line of defense against any potential intruders.{{Cite dragon/234/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Lich Magical Items|81}}
