'''Yeast''' was a species of microscopic [[fungus]] that received wide use in [[alcohol]]-making

==Description==
Yeast had a distinct smell often associated with baking. It flourished in warm areas but high temperature killed yeast.

==Uses==
In the days of ancient [[Netheril]], fruity yeast grew on grains cultivated by the empire.

In [[Eltabbar]],{{Cite adventurers league/Uncertain Scrutiny|8}} [[Berdusk]], and [[Zakhara]], yeast was used in [[wine]]-making, being added into [[jug]]s of juice from pulverized [[grape]]s and sealed to ferment.

[[Elminster's Choice]] was a type of dark [[beer]] from [[Immersea]] that was cloudy with yeast.

[[Ayakar]], a coastal town in [[Turmish]], was famed for its [[sourdough]] bread made with a type of naturally occurring yeast from the sea. That export was the inspiration behind a common saying "May your bread be sour, and your salt be fresh."{{Cite adventurers league/Breaking Umberlee's Resolve|6}}

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], a drink called [[Abyss' Alive and Kicking]] was made in [[Zelatar]] of [[Azzagrat]]. The dire [[wheat]] brew was made and consumed with living bubbling yeast.

The [[spell]] ''[[age wine]]'', used in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] required a pinch of yeast as a [[spell component]].{{Cite polyhedron/62/The Living City: As The Vine Twines|16}}

==Locations==
The [[Larawkan Lane]] in [[Selgaunt]] had a constant strong aroma of yeast and freshly baked bread. That pleasant aroma also was encountered in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. In the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]], yeast was a trade commodity often carried by merchants alongside [[flour]] and [[spice]]s.
