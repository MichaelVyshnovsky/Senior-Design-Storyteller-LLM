        "mainbody": "loudspore mushrooms were a peculiar species of fungus that typically grew in the Underdark.\nThis species of mushroom grew in patches and was so named for its propensity to unleash thick clouds of spores when disturbed. Once a cloud was discharged, a patch of cloudspores would not unleash another for 24 hours.\n* Beyond the Prime Material plane, it was not uncommon to encounter cloudspores in Molor, the 528 layer of the Abyss ruled by Juiblex.\nAt some point long before the 15 century DR, a Silvanus worshiping druid took up residence within a barrow in southern Unther and therein cultivated cloudspore mushrooms. Centuries later, when a young blue dragon took up residence in the abandoned barrow in 1479 DR, a few of the druids specimens still remained."
