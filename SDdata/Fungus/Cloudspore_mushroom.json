        "mainbody": "'''Cloudspore mushrooms''' were a peculiar species of [[fungus]] that typically grew in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Description": "This species of mushroom grew in patches and was so named for its propensity to unleash thick clouds of spores when disturbed. Once a cloud was discharged, a patch of cloudspores would not unleash another for 24 hours.",
        "Habitats": "* Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], it was not uncommon to encounter cloudspores in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer_528:_Molor|Molor, the 528{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]] ruled by [[Juiblex]].<ref>",
        "History": "At some point long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[Silvanus]] worshiping [[druid]] took up residence within a barrow in southern [[Unther]] and therein cultivated cloudspore mushrooms. Centuries later, when a young [[blue dragon]] took up residence in the abandoned barrow in [[1479 DR]], a few of the druid's specimens still remained.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Taking Stock of the Situation|25}}{{4e-time}}"
