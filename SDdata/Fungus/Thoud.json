        "mainbody": "'''Thoud''' ({{Pronounce|thood|refs=}}) were a kind of edible [[mushroom]] found around [[Blustich]].",
        "Description": "Thoud were unpleasant-looking mushrooms that looked like gray-white [[corn]]cobs growing up from the ground like spikes. The corn kernel bumps were in fact spore sacs, which eventually dried out, broke open, and released a thin stream of fine dark gray spores that resembled a thread of smoke trailing from the mushroom. Their stems were very short and thick and mostly hidden by the cap, and had the appearance and toughness of a gnarled [[pumpkin]] stem.",
        "Availability": "Thoud were rarely found around Blustich on the [[Cormyr/Coast|coast]] of [[Cormyr]] and even harder to find elsewhere, and harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with [[uttercap]]s and [[khondyn]] mushrooms, particularly before winter.",
        "Usages": "Raw thoud were edible and similar to eating a raw [[potato]], but when baked it became lighter and fluffy. Raw or cooked, the taste resembled [[butter]]ed popped corn with a variable taste of [[dill]], [[garlic]], or [[chives]] depending on where the mushroom had grown. In sandy soil the thoud had a stronger dill taste, rich soil tasted of garlic, and thoud from intermediate soil tasted like chives."
