'''Khondyn''' (or '''mushroom pies''') were a kind of edible [[mushroom]] found mainly around [[Blustich]].

==Description==
Khondyn mushrooms were wide, circular, dun-brown flat-capped mushrooms that looked like plates balanced on stalks. As they aged and started to rot they turned dark brown and eventually a glistening black, though they remained perfectly edible if not palatable.

==Availability==
Khondyn were common around Blustich on the [[Cormyr/Coast|coast]] of [[Cormyr]] but rare elsewhere, and regularly harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with [[uttercap]]s and [[thoud]] mushrooms, particularly before winter.

==Usages==
A single mushroom pie was large enough to be a full meal for an adult, and could be eaten raw with a taste similar to [[bread]]ed [[chicken]]. When fried the taste became similar to a sharp [[cheddar]] [[cheese]], and when baked atop [[bread]] or [[flatbread]] dough it imparted a broader cheesy taste.
