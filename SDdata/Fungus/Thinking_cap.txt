Thinking caps were a species of giant fungi that grew underground.
These fungi were not toxic to ingest, though they had a taste reminiscent of chlorine.
One of the known locations of these fungi was beneath the Misty Forest.
If removed carefully, the caps of these mushrooms could be used as makeshift rafts.
