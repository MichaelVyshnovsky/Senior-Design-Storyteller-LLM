'''Pearlspore bells''' were a species of huge mundane [[mushroom]]s that could be imbued with [[hag]]gish fell magics, found sometime growing in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Usages==
Pearlspore bells was known to be used by hags to avoid being slain. A hag could link herself with one of several clusters of pearlspore bells and, eventually, be reborn through the fungi after being slain. This was believed to be a speculation by some.

==History==
The book called ''[[Fastidious Fungi]]'' included some information on hags and the pearlspore bell mushrooms that could be used to return a slain hag to the land of the living. In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a copy of ''Fastidious Fungi'' was studied by [[Mayrina]] after forming the [[Anti-Hag Support Group]], in search of ways to stop hags' sinister and malicious plots. The same year, [[green hag]] [[Auntie Ethel]] imbued several pearlspore bells with her magics in attempts to keep herself alive. The mushrooms were planted in her subterranean lair under the [[Blushing Maiden Inn]].
