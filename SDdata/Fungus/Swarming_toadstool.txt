'''Swarming toadstool''' was a parasitic species of [[fungus]] that could be found almost anywhere, clustering bigger species of mushrooms.

==Description==
Swarming toadstools appeared to be a cluster of smaller mushroom heads sprouting from a single stem of a biter mushroom. These fungi were of sickly green and yellowish color.

Found in many underground locations and the [[Underdark]], these mushrooms were valued around 20 [[gold]] pieces per cluster.
