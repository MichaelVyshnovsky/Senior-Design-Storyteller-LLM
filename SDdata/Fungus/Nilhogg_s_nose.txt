'''Nilhogg's nose''' was a small fungus that grew in the [[Underdark]]. It was edible, but provided no nutrition. When consumed, it enhanced the sense of smell for one to four hours, improving the chance of detecting and/or identifying odors. However, under the influence of this mushroom, the consumer was also more vulnerable to the effects of smells, such as the nauseating stench of a [[ghast]], for example.
