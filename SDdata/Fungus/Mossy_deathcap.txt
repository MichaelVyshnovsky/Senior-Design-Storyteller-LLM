Mossy deathcap was a type of mushroom that was toxic to non-plant creatures.
These mushrooms were speckled with moss and grew in dense clusters. They were not only toxic but highly unstable walking across a patch without care caused a cloud of poisonous spores to be launched into the air. Destroying a mossy deathcap neutralized its toxic spores.
These mushrooms infested patches of moss, including oblivion moss.
They could be found underground, such as beneath the Delhalls in Vaasa.
