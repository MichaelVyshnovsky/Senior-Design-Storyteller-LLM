Bluecap fungus was the main staple grain of the Underdark, where they absorbed magics of faerzress, while a more mundane species of bluecaps was grown in the High Moor of the Western Heartlands.
Bluecaps were tall (up to 6 inches), slender white mushrooms with pale blue caps. These fungi were bland and tasteless.
Bluecaps found in the Underdark were inedible in their raw state, but the fungi could be ground into a bland flour and baked into nutritious sporebread (also called bluebread). Bluecap was known for its ease of cultivation (it could be grown with or without faerzress), and it was cultivated by nearly all of the Underdark races. A loaf of sporebread was equivalent to one pound (almost a half kilogram) of food.
The caps of bluecap mushrooms could be prepared by those with the correct herbalism knowledge to make a stew that would neutralize poison. If eaten raw, High Moor bluecap proved mild amount of nutrients. Because of that, omnivorous creature of the High Moor consumed the mushrooms as a dietary supplement.
Bluecap was cultivated nearly everywhere in the Underdark.
