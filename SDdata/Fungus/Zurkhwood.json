        "mainbody": "'''Zurkhwood''' was a fungus that grew in the [[Underdark]]. It had edible spores and the tree-like stems could be used as a building material.",
        "Description": "Zurkhwood mushrooms grew {{SIrange|30|40|ft}} tall when in a cavern with enough height. The stems were hard and sturdy like wood. When cut, it exhibited unique patterns, analogous to the grain found in lumber.",
        "Uses": "Zurkhwood was primarily used as a building material. Its long stems could be used to make bridges and skilled carpenters could use it to make furniture, shipping containers, and almost anything that could be made from wood. Zurkhwood floated in water and could also be used to make boats and rafts,  The woody substance could be sanded, stained, and polished to bring out the decorative patterns in the heart of the mushroom stem.\n\nThe spores of the zurkhwood were large, like grains of [[wheat]], and if harvested from a typical specimen, yielded {{SIrange|5|8|lb|k}} of food.\n\nThe [[kobold]] [[bard]] [[Deekin Scalesinger]] made the dubious claim that Zurkhwood bark balm was \"good for hair\"."
