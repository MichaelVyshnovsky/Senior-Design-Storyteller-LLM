'''Witchcap toadstools''' were a variety of fungus that were found in the [[Feywild]].{{Template:Cite game/Neverwinter: Fury of the Feywild}}

==Description==
These mushrooms were quite broad, wider across than they were tall. Even then, they could grow nearly as tall as [[humanoid]] figure.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[fomorian]] king [[Malabog]] conquered an expanse of the Feywild and twisted the land to better suit his own desires. He ordered the fomorian witches of his army to plant witchcap toadstools along a great river, transforming it into a twisted swamp known as the [[Putrid Fen]].

In response, [[Kehl Skywatcher]] of [[New Sharandar]] hired adventurers to set many of the large mushrooms aflame, in order to remove their taint on the natural world.
