'''Deathcap mushrooms''' were a species of unassuming but very [[poison]]ous [[fungi]] found in the [[Savage Frontier]] on the [[Northwest Faerûn]].

==Description==
Deathcaps appeared to be almost indistinguishable from the harmless varieties of mushrooms that grew in the cavers along the northern coast – grey stalk and skirt with a green cap atop. The only distinguishable feature was that deathcaps grew a bit bigger in size than their neighbors. Deathcap mushrooms were treacherous fungi – they tasted positively delicious but were a deadly poison.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Aleema Meddlebrook]], who traveled along the [[Trade Way]] from [[Neverwinter]] to the city of [[Luskan]] with [[Tollin]]'s caravan, sought to harvest deathcap mushrooms from a cave near to where the caravan was ambushed bu bandits. She asked the [[Champion of the Burning Dawn]] and their companions to retrieve the fungi if they were to stumble across some. Aleena advised the heroes not to eat any of the deathcaps.
