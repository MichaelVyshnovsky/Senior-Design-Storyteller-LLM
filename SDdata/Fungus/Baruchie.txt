The baruchie, also known as the crimson spitter, was a type of fungus found growing wild in the Underdark.
This type of fungus was luminescent, emitting a faint red glow.
Whenever a baruchie colony was disturbed, such as being stepped on, it released a cloud of spores that caused creatures to sputter and choke.
Baruchie colonies were the favored meal of grubbers.
