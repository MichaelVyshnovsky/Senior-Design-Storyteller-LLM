The '''baruchie''', also known as the '''crimson spitter''', was a type of fungus found growing wild in the [[Underdark]].

==Description==
This type of fungus was luminescent, emitting a faint red glow.

==Behavior==
Whenever a baruchie colony was disturbed, such as being stepped on, it released a cloud of spores that caused creatures to sputter and choke.

==Ecology==
Baruchie colonies were the favored meal of [[grubber]]s.
