        "mainbody": "'''Uttercaps''' (or '''fairy clusters''') were a kind of edible [[mushroom]] found mainly around [[Blustich]] in [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "Uttercaps were found in clusters of 5–8 nut-brown caps about the size of the end-joint of a [[human]] thumb, growing from very dark-brown slender stems about the length of a [[human]] hand. They tasted similar to roasted [[almond]]s, and were fortunately very visually distinct from local [[poison]]ous mushrooms.",
        "Availability": "Uttercaps grew prolifically around Blustich on the [[Cormyr/Coast|Cormyrean coast]] and were regularly harvested to supplement the food supply of the village along with [[khondyn]] and [[thoud]] mushrooms, particularly before winter.",
        "Usages": "Uttercaps could be eaten raw, but were also fried in [[butter]] or [[boar]] [[fat]], and were often eaten as snacks by the children of Blustich as they played outside the village. They were sometimes added to [[brandy]], which imparted a nutty, buttery, near-[[cinnamon]] taste to the drink."
