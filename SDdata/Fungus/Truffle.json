        "mainbody": "'''Truffles''' were a species of rare edible [[mushroom]]s found in several areas of the [[Realms]], including the marshy areas around the [[High Forest]] in [[Northwest Faerûn]], the [[Dalelands]], and in the [[Mhair Jungles]], west of the wizardly nation of [[Halruaa]] in [[South Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "Truffles were plump, fragrant, and meaty mushrooms that could grow the size of an adult [[elf]]'s fist. They had a savory taste. In a similar manner, [[wereboar]]s were sensitive to the aroma of truffles and could smell them in the humanoid form as deep as several feet underground.",
        "Uses": {
            "Culinary": "*Truffles could be found growing underneath [[oak]]s of the swampy areas in the High Forest. Travelers who crossed the forests were known to gather the savory mushrooms and cook them with [[herb]]s and [[rice]] steamed in [[kettle]]s.\n*In the Dalelands, [[River Ashaba]]'s [[trout]]s were filleted and served with black-truffle [[oil]] and warm [[apricot]]s. [[Old Tower Fowl]], a dish with truffles, could be found in [[The Rising Moon (inn)|The Rising Moon]] inn of [[Highmoon]] of [[Deepingdale]].\n*Truffles and other exotic mushrooms were gathered  and exported out of the [[Adhe Wood]] of [[the Vast]].",
            "Magic": "*The [[spell]] ''[[puffball]]'' affected mundane mushrooms, including truffles."
