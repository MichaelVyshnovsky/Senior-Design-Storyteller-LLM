        "mainbody": "Truffles were a species of rare edible mushrooms found in several areas of the Realms, including the marshy areas around the High Forest in Northwest Faerûn, the Dalelands, and in the Mhair Jungles, west of the wizardly nation of Halruaa in South Faerûn.\nTruffles were plump, fragrant, and meaty mushrooms that could grow the size of an adult elfs fist. They had a savory taste. In a similar manner, wereboars were sensitive to the aroma of truffles and could smell them in the humanoid form as deep as several feet underground.\n*Truffles could be found growing underneath oaks of the swampy areas in the High Forest. Travelers who crossed the forests were known to gather the savory mushrooms and cook them with herbs and rice steamed in kettles.\n*In the Dalelands, River Ashabas trouts were filleted and served with black-truffle oil and warm apricots. Old Tower Fowl, a dish with truffles, could be found in The Rising Moon inn of Highmoon of Deepingdale.\n*Truffles and other exotic mushrooms were gathered  and exported out of the Adhe Wood of the Vast.\n*The spell puffball affected mundane mushrooms, including truffles."
