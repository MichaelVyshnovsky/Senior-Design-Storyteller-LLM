        "mainbody": "'''Deathsbreath mushrooms''' were a variety of [[fungus]] that grew predominantly on the [[High Moor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. They had a large and speckled appearance.\n\nThough they were a delicacy for [[goblinoid]]s, most others found them toxic, suffering nausea for up to twenty minutes.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], deathsbreath mushrooms grew in abundance in a cave in the southern fringe of the [[High Forest]] used as a hideout by [[Hekkut]] and his [[goblin]] bandit gang."
