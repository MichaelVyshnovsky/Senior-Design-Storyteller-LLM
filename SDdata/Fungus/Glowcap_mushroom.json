        "Description": "''Glowcap mushrooms'' were popular among people traveling through the unwelcoming deep cavers of Underdark, providing them with much needed illumination and pleasant-tasting food.",
        "Availability": "Even though glowcaps grew only in the Underdark, they were a trade commodity. Merchants from the Underdark traded [[wine]]s and glowcap mushrooms for [[Calishite]] [[silk]]s, pitted [[date]]s, and metal-works of good quality. This trade was especially lucrative among surface expatriates from Underdark.\n\nGlowcaps were one of the ingredient in preparing [[duergar]] [[fragrant fungus stew]] that possessed a bright flavor and was popular in the [[Western Heartlands]]."
