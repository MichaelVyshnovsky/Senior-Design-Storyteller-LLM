        "mainbody": "lowcap mushrooms were edible luminescent fungi found in the depths of the Underdark.\nGlowcap mushrooms were popular among people traveling through the unwelcoming deep cavers of Underdark, providing them with much needed illumination and pleasant-tasting food.\nEven though glowcaps grew only in the Underdark, they were a trade commodity. Merchants from the Underdark traded wines and glowcap mushrooms for Calishite silks, pitted dates, and metal-works of good quality. This trade was especially lucrative among surface expatriates from Underdark.\nGlowcaps were one of the ingredient in preparing duergar fragrant fungus stew that possessed a bright flavor and was popular in the Western Heartlands."
