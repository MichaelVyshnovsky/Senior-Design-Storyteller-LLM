        "mainbody": "Rogues morsel was a species of edible mushrooms found in close proximity to trees, hiding in their shadows.\nThese small grey mushrooms had a reputation of helping rogues on the run to survive while hiding in the forests. They filled the bellies of those close to the ground, both humanoids and forest beasts.\nRogues morsels were valued at five gold coins.\nSweet-smelling salts of rogues morsel, alchemically extracted out of the mushrooms dried gills cold be mixed with a special type of suspension to brew a basic healing potion."
