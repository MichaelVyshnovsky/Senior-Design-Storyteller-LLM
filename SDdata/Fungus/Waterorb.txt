'''Waterorb''' was a type of [[fungus]] that grew in the [[Underdark]] in shallow water. When mature, it was bulbous in shape and bigger than a [[human]] head. If squeezed and wrung out, it yielded about a gallon (almost four liters) of potable water. The remaining husk was bland and chewy like a [[sponge]], but edible, providing about {{SI|1|lb|k}} of food.
