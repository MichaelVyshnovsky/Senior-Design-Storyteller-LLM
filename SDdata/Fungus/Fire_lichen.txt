'''Fire lichen''' was a type of [[lichen]] that grew in the [[Underdark]] near sources of geothermal heat. It was recognizable by its stalks of pale orange-white. When ground to powder and fermented, it formed a paste that was very spicy but edible, added to soups and stews or spread on [[sporebread]] for flavor.

[[Duergar]] were known to ferment fire lichen into an extremely hot alcoholic beverage.
