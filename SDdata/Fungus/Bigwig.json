        "mainbody": "'''Bigwig''' fungus was a ''[[faerzress]]''-infused mushroom found only in the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] below the [[duergar]] city of [[Gracklstugh]].",
        "Description": "Bigwigs had a thin stem topped by a purple cap. Each one grew to about 4 inches (10 centimeters) tall.",
        "Uses": "Consuming a bigwig caused the consumer to double in size and increase in weight eight-fold (as if affected by an ''[[enlarge]]'' spell) for one hour. Consuming more than one of these mushrooms did not cause further increases in size, but did extend the duration of the affects by another hour each. A few minutes before the effects wore off, the consumer would feel a slight tingling before reducing back to normal size.\n\nThe effects could be reversed by consuming a [[pygmywort]] mushroom or having a ''[[reduce]]'' spell cast upon the affected being.\n\nBigwig mushrooms lost their size-changing affects if taken from the Whorlstone Tunnels for more than an hour."
