Askume was a fungus that grew in the Underdark. 
Askume grew in patches on warm cavern walls. Each reddish-orange patch was  in diameter.
Each patch of askume, when crushed, could yield 2&ndash4 applications of a dust that could be blown into the face of an individual. The dust caused an allergic reaction making the recipients tongue and windpipe swell, leading to suffocation and possibly death.
Those who purposely grew askume and sold it were vigorous in their protection of the patches for a dose of the poison could sell for up to 150 gold pieces each.
