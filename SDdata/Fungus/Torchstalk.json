        "mainbody": "Torchstalk was a fungus that grew in the Underdark.\nThe torchstalk mushroom grew to a height of one to two feet (30 to 60 centimeters) and had a flammable, gas-filled orange round cap. Unfortunately, about one in six of these fungi exploded when lit, sending out flaming spores in a ten foot (three meter) radius, pelting all within range. Those that didnt burst ignited like a torch and could be used as such for 24 hours.\nThe deep-purple colored torchstalk were known to be less volatile and, on occasion, were used as slow-burning torches in the Underdark. Another way of identifying deadly explosive torchstalks was by paying attention to any of their victims bones scattered nearby.\nIn Gatchorof and Gracklstugh, torchstalks were cultivated by the civilized Underdark humanoids, while they grew in the wild throughout the Northern Middledark."
