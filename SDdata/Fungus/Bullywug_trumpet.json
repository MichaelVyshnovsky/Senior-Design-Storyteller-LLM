        "mainbody": "ullywug trumpet was a species of edible fungus that could be found in most dark and moist places.\nThese mushrooms were shaped like trumpets and bluish green in color, expelling their name. They could be found in many subterranean wet locations. These mushrooms were valued at twenty gold coins for a good-sized specimen.\nEven though edible, bullywug trumpets were unappetizing and sour to taste.\nA suspension could be extracted from bullywug trumpets through alchemy. The resulting substance was an acrid tincture that stung eyes if was left uncorked. When mixed with certain types of sublimates, suspension of bullywug trumpet formed a simple poison."
