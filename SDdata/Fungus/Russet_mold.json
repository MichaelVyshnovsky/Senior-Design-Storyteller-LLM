        "mainbody": "'''Russet molds''' were a very rare variety of underground [[fungus|fungal]] mold.",
        "Description": "Russet mold had an irregular texture and was covered in short growths that resembled hair. They stood upright and slowly wove back and forth. It varied in color from gold-brown to rust-red and appeared as a patch of rust from a distance of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} or more.",
        "Behavior": "Being a fungus, russet molds had no intellect.",
        "Biology": "Russet molds were always surrounded by a cloud of spores that was {{SI|3|ft|c|long=yes}} in radius. The spores were continuously emitted by the mold. Any creature that came into contact with these spores were stuck with a paralyzing illness and died unless treated with ''[[cure disease]]''.\n\nThe corpse of a creature killed by the spores became covered in new russet mold growths. These new growths were very hardy. A ''[[hold plant]]'' spell only stopped the growth for the duration of the spell, and if ''cure disease'' was cast within an hour of death, that was enough to destroy the new spread of mold. After an hour, only ''[[wish]]'' was capable of destroying the spread. Eventually, the corpse became a [[vegepygmy]].",
        "Abilities": "Russet mold was immune to damage from weapons and the effects of most [[spell]]s. The only mundane methods to kill a russet mold was with acid, alcohol or salt. The only magical means of killing a russet mold was with the ''[[continual light]]'' or ''cure disease'' spells.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Habitats": "Russet molds were typically found underground, in areas that were dark and moist.\n\nIn the [[Abyss]], russet molds could be found in [[Shedaklah]], the Slime Pits, [[Layers of the Abyss#222|222nd layer of the Abyss]]."
