        "mainbody": "rown mold was a variety of fungus that grew in response to warmth. So extremely did it absorb heat that it produced an area of cold around it.\nBrown mold often grew in subterranean or dungeon environments in large patches of about  in diameter. A patch of this size absorbed enough heat to cool the temperature of the air within a  radius. Within  of the patch of mold, it was cold enough to cause non-lethal injury to some creatures.\nBrown mold grew extremely quickly when exposed to great sources of heat such as a nearby flame, doubling in size in only a matter of seconds. In contrast, the mold could be annihilated almost immediately by the effects of a spell dealing cold damage\nBesides its natural existence as a dungeon hazard, some found practical uses for brown mold, such as using it to cool food pantries, as was done in the Cathedral of Emerald Scales in Hlondeth. In the House of the Moon in Waterdeep, in the west pantry, a small brown mold colony was carefully maintained in a sealed barrel in a small  pit, kept safely under a locked grate to keep people more than  way, and in the refrigerated pantry, a large brown mold colony was contained within a stone tub. Sign on the doors forbade anyone taking fire or any other heat source inside.\nBrown mold was also created by the spell mold touch, which was a unique spell available to followers of nature deities Eldath, Mielikki, and Silvanus.\nThe mind flayers were rumored to have developed varieties of brown mold that continued to cool the vicinity around them without harming other life. These varieties were said to grow on illithid homeworlds."
