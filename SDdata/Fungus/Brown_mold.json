        "mainbody": "'''Brown mold''' was a variety of [[fungus]] that grew in response to warmth. So extremely did it absorb heat that it produced an area of cold around it.",
        "Description": "Brown mold often grew in subterranean or dungeon environments in large patches of about {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. A patch of this size absorbed enough heat to cool the temperature of the air within a {{SIAdj|30|ft}} radius. Within {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} of the patch of mold, it was cold enough to cause non-lethal injury to some creatures.\n\nBrown mold grew extremely quickly when exposed to great sources of heat such as a nearby flame, doubling in size in only a matter of seconds. In contrast, the mold could be annihilated almost immediately by the effects of a spell dealing cold damage",
        "Usage": "Besides its natural existence as a dungeon hazard, some found practical uses for brown mold, such as using it to cool food pantries, as was done in the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]] in [[Hlondeth]]. In the [[House of the Moon]] in [[Waterdeep]], in the west pantry, a small brown mold colony was carefully maintained in a sealed barrel in a small {{SIAdj|8|ft|long=yes|adj=deep}} pit, kept safely under a locked grate to keep people more than {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} way, and in the refrigerated pantry, a large brown mold colony was contained within a stone tub. Sign on the doors forbade anyone taking fire or any other heat source inside.\n\nBrown mold was also created by the spell ''[[mold touch]]'', which was a unique spell available to followers of nature deities [[Eldath]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Silvanus]].",
        "Rumors": "The [[mind flayer]]s were rumored to have developed varieties of brown mold that continued to cool the vicinity around them without harming other life. These varieties were said to grow on illithid homeworlds.{{Cite dragon/150/The Dragon's Bestiary: All life crawls where mind flayers rule|12}}"
