        "Description": "These mushrooms were speckled with [[moss]] and grew in dense clusters. They were not only toxic but highly unstable: walking across a patch without care caused a cloud of poisonous spores to be launched into the air. Destroying a mossy deathcap neutralized its toxic spores.",
        "Ecology": "These mushrooms infested patches of moss, including [[oblivion moss]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|11}}\n\nThey could be found underground, such as beneath the [[Delhalls]] in [[Vaasa]]."
