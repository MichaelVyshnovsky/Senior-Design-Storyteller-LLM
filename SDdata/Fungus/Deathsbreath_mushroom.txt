Deathsbreath mushrooms were a variety of fungus that grew predominantly on the High Moor in the Western Heartlands. They had a large and speckled appearance.
Though they were a delicacy for goblinoids, most others found them toxic, suffering nausea for up to twenty minutes.
Circa 1372 DR, deathsbreath mushrooms grew in abundance in a cave in the southern fringe of the High Forest used as a hideout by Hekkut and his goblin bandit gang.
