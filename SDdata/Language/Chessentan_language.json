        "mainbody": "'''Chessentan''', also called '''Chessic''',{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} was the regional language of the confederation of [[Chessenta]], located in the [[Old Empires]] region of southern [[Faerûn]].",
        "Speakers": "It was spoken primarily by both [[Chessenta]]ns and [[Ixinos]]ians\n\n[[Lightfoot halfling]]s also sometimes learned Chessentan as a second language, and the [[Elf|elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]].\n\nThere were three major dialects&mdash;Western, Threskian, and Ixinosian.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}}",
        "Script": "Chessentan was usually written in the [[Thorass alphabet]], but as late as [[1357 DR]], in their written records, Chessentans employed a variant of [[Untheric]] runes, reduced to the form of an alphabet.",
        "History": "Chessentan was one of the [[Chessentic languages]], derived from [[Auld Chessic]] and related to [[Alambit]].\n\nWhilst they were a part of Unther's empire, the Chessentan people generally spoke [[Untheric]]. Following their liberation, they eventually abandoned this tongue some time around the mid–12th century [[DR]], adopting instead the [[Common]] language of the west",
        "Examples": "Typical surnames from this tongue included Aporos, Corynian, Heldeion, Morieth, Nathos, Sphaerideion, and Zora. Male children were given names such as Aeron, Daelric, Eurid, Nicos, Oriseus, Pharaxes, Thersos, or Xandos. Women might be named Ariadne, Cylla, Eriale, Halonya, Idriane, Mera, Numestra, or Sinylla."
