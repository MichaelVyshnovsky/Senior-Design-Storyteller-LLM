        "mainbody": "hessentan, also called Chessic, was the regional language of the confederation of Chessenta, located in the Old Empires region of southern Faerûn.\nIt was spoken primarily by both Chessentans and Ixinosians\nLightfoot halflings also sometimes learned Chessentan as a second language, and the elves of the Yuirwood.\nThere were three major dialects&mdashWestern, Threskian, and Ixinosian.\nChessentan was usually written in the Thorass alphabet, but as late as 1357 DR, in their written records, Chessentans employed a variant of Untheric runes, reduced to the form of an alphabet.\nChessentan was one of the Chessentic languages, derived from Auld Chessic and related to Alambit.\nWhilst they were a part of Unthers empire, the Chessentan people generally spoke Untheric. Following their liberation, they eventually abandoned this tongue some time around the mid–12th century DR, adopting instead the Common language of the west\nTypical surnames from this tongue included Aporos, Corynian, Heldeion, Morieth, Nathos, Sphaerideion, and Zora. Male children were given names such as Aeron, Daelric, Eurid, Nicos, Oriseus, Pharaxes, Thersos, or Xandos. Women might be named Ariadne, Cylla, Eriale, Halonya, Idriane, Mera, Numestra, or Sinylla."
