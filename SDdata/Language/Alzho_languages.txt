The '''Alzho languages''' was a sub-grouping of the [[Untheric languages]] group of [[Rauric languages]].<ref name=D:SiT-p29>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Languages==
The only surviving language in this category was [[Alzhedo|Calishite Alzhedo]].<ref name=D:SiT-p29 />

==History==
The Alzho languages branched off from the other Untheric languages by mixing with the [[Auran|tongue]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]],<ref name=D:SiT-p29 /> because of the influence of [[djinn]] on the earliest inhabitants of [[Calimshan]].
