'''Akalan''' was the original tongue of the [[Arkaiun]]s.

==Speakers==
By [[1367 DR]], Akalan was a language used by most of the population of [[Dambrath]].

The Arkaiuns of the outlaw [[Swagdar]] wastes spoke a Swag creole dialect of Akalan.

The language was used by traders across [[Durpar]] and [[Var the Golden]]<ref> and possibly even as far as [[Zakhara]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum | title = Rashemi & Jotun Languages| author = [[Thomas M.

Considering how Dambrath often traded with Zakhara, it may be that Akotan is an another dialect, alias, or mistranslation for Akalan. [[Thomas M. Costa|Tom Costa]] adds validity to this assumption in a post on the Candlekeep Forum. His post is cited here.
