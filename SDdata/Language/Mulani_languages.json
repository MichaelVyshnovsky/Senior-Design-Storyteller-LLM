This article attributes information provided about that language in later sources to the Mulani group as a whole, as the history of the people groups speaking these languages are also clearly outlined.\nThe Mulani languages were further subdivided into the Mulhorandi and Muhjuri branches.\nThe Mulani languages derived in part from a slave argot of one or more of the Imaskari languages. Over the millennia, the Mulani tongues remained more similar to their Rauric roots than did the Untheric languages."
