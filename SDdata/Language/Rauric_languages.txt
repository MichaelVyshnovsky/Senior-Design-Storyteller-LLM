The '''Rauric languages''' were a family of languages with an origin in the [[Old Empires]] and [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Language Groups==
Scholars divided the family into two major branches, the [[Mulani languages|Mulani]] and [[Untheric languages]]. but they were not truly related,{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|28}} although [[Untheric]] did strongly influence [[Chessentan language|Chessentan]].

==History==
The [[Imaskari languages]] strongly influenced the Rauric languages of [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]] and Untheric, through the [[Ancient Imask languages]] Rauran and Reian, which were spoken in the region before the coming of the [[Mulan]]. Slave argots of these tongues contributed in part to the development of both Mulhorandi and Untheric.
