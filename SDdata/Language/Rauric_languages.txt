The Rauric languages were a family of languages with an origin in the Old Empires and Zakhara.
Scholars divided the family into two major branches, the Mulani and Untheric languages. but they were not truly related, although Untheric did strongly influence Chessentan.
The Imaskari languages strongly influenced the Rauric languages of Mulhorandi and Untheric, through the Ancient Imask languages Rauran and Reian, which were spoken in the region before the coming of the Mulan. Slave argots of these tongues contributed in part to the development of both Mulhorandi and Untheric.
