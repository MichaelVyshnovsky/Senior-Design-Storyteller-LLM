        "mainbody": "he Gnoll language, also referred to as Gnollish, and flinds.\nThe language was not a complete one, only able to communicate basic concepts. It consisted of cackling, howling, and whining sounds and often relied on gestures and facial expressions. Such words were mixed with a broken version of the Abyssal language, allowing the leaders among them to communicate more complex thoughts.\nBeyond gnolls themselves, Gnoll was sometimes spoken as a second language by bugbears, elves (of the Chondalwood, the Forest of Lethyr, and the High Forest), feyri, forest gnomes, goblins, lizardfolk, orcs, half-orcs, and zebranaurs. Among elves it was typically learned by moon elves and wild elves.\nWhen it came to regions, Gnoll was somewhat common as a language in Anauroch, Dambrath, Lapaliiya, and among warriors in Thar. Gnomes of the Great Dale and halflings of Channath, the Chondalwood, and Luiren also occasionally spoke it.\nGnoll had no true script or written form, but some gnolls were shrewd enough to write in Abyssal.\nGnolls believed that their language was a gift to them from Yeenoghu.\nThe following were common names for males in the Gnoll tongue Brask, Dagnyr, Dhyrn, Doryc, Durrash, Faush, Ghyrryn, Gnasc, Gnoryc, Gnyrn, Hyrn, Lask, Lhoryn, Lhyr, Mognyr, Sorgnyn, Thovarr, Thyrn, Toryc, Wesk, Yrgnyn, and Yrych.

Translations of common Gnoll surnames included Blood-fang, Ear-taker, Face-ripper, and Spear-breaker. Sometimes, Yeenoghu would bless a follower with a special name. A few such names were Aargab, Alark, Andak, Ethak, Eyeth, Ignar, Immor, Oduk, Orrom, Otal, Ulthak, and Ustar.\n* Macon the Monkey Mage, a human wizard in the Vast who made a living off of cursed items in the 14 century DR.\n* Shazzelurt, a senient magical dagger."
