Each tribe on the Plateau had their own [[sign language]], which were distinct enough from one another that mixing them could not be done.{{Cite polyhedron/108/Jungle Lore|16}}",
        "History": "The various sign languages used by tribes on the Malatran Plateau developed over time from the necessity of hunters needing a way to communicate to one another without alerting their prey. In an effort to better facilitate communication, one form of sign language on the Plateau was developed by the [[lacerial]]s and taught to a select few tribes.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/129/More Living Jungle Races|33}}"
