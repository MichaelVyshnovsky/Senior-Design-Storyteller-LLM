Nexalan was a language considered to be the primary tongue of the people of Maztica, though in actuality was the native tongue of the Nexalan ethnic group of humans.
The Nexalan tongue was spoken primarily in the nations of Huacli, Nexal, Kultaka, and Pezelac. Beyond the Nexalans themselves, a crude form of the language was spoken by the orcs, ogres, and trolls that lived in the Valley of Nexal.
Beyond the land of Maztica, the Nexalan tongue had a few speakers in the nation of Amn, but was otherwise unknown to most Faer√ªnians.
Huacli A related, though distinct language spoken in the nation of Huacli. It had six dialects, each spoken in one of the nations six city-states. Huacli was the most divergent of the related languages, being the most difficult language for speakers of Nexalan to converse with.
