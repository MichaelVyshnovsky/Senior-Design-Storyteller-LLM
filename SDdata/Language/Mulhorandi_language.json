        "mainbody": "'''Mulhorandi''' was a regional tongue of the [[Old Empires]], and the official language of [[Mulhorand]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} A [[Thayan language|variation]] of Mulhorandi was the official language of Thay.",
        "Speakers": "Mulhorandi was commonly in use between the [[River Thazarim]] and the [[River of Swords]] and between the [[Alamber Sea]] and [[Gbor Nor]]. [[Rashemen]], and the [[elves]] from [[SildÃ«yuir]] and the [[Yuirwood]].",
        "Description": "Mulhorandi was highly inflected, that is, it relied on word affixes&mdash;suffixes or prefixes&mdash;instead of word order to convey grammatical meaning. To speakers of many other languages, it sounded slow and thick. It was a slowly evolving language and maintained much of the flavor of its earliest forms over time. Priestly rituals had a strong effect on everyday speech.",
        "Script": "In its earliest form, Mulhorandi used a [[wikipedia:en:Logogram|logographic system]] of writing, with pictographs to represent concepts. and in the ruins of the fortress [[Maskana]] in the [[Raurin Desert]].{{Cite web enhancement/Secrets of Imaskar|2}}) Over the millennia, the written form of the language was simplified yet still contained tens of thousands of pictographs. The average Mulhorandi citizen had about 3,000 of these pictographs memorized, while the priests knew far more.\n\nAt some stage in history, the god [[Thoth]] taught the [[Mulan]] the alphabet of the [[Celestial language]], and by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], in most areas where Mulhorandi was spoken, its speakers used this alphabet; however, the [[Thayan language|Thayan dialect]] used the [[Infernal language|Infernal]] alphabet instead, as a direct insult to the god-kings of Mulhorand, as does the cult of [[Set]].",
        "Related Languages": "Mulhorandi was in the [[Mulani languages]] group{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}} within the [[Rauric languages]] family. It was related to both Thayan and [[Muhjuri]].",
        "Examples": "Common Mulhorandi surnames included Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Siasobek, Uuthrakt, and Zianhur. Surnames starting with \"Sia\" or \"Zia\" indicated a bloodline from one of the gods.\n\nFirst names for males included Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, and Urhur. Example names for females included Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, and Zolis. [[Tiefling]]s from the Old Empires often had Mulhorandi given names.",
