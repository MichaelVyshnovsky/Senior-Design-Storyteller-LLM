The Drow language was the most common native language of the drow.
Deep Drow, also known as Low Drow or Drowic, was the normal language of the drow. Each isolated community had its own variant with a distinct accent. Deep Drow was read right to left in single-word columns with little punctuation.
High Drow was a more complex language than Deep Drow and had a larger, runic alphabet. This language was primarily used by priestesses in their rituals and by nobles who wished not to be understood by lower-born drow and slaves.
Drow Sign Language was a silent hand code used to communicate in the Underdark. Unlike other languages that must be heard to be comprehended, Drow Sign must be seen to gather meaning. It had no alphabet or written form.
