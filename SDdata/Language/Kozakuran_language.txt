'''Kozakuran''' was a language spoken by the [[Kozakuran]] people, inhabitants of the realm of [[Kozakura]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

Kozakuran descended from the ancient [[Han language]], as did [[Koryo language|Koryo]] and [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]], and possibly others.

It was considered a sophisticated language, thanks to the high level of literacy in Kozakura and the frequent publication of poetry and plays there. Popular plays regularly introduced new accents and phrasesâ€”within a few weeks, a popular new play could change common greetings across the country, which could just as quickly be replaced.
