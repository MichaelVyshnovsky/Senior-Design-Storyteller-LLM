'''Uluik''' was the language of the [[Ice Hunters]] of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Speakers==
Properly, Uluik was the [[High Ulutim languages|High Ulutim language]] spoken by the westernmost ethnic subgroup of [[Ulutiun]]s residing on the [[Sea of Moving Ice]], the [[Ice Peak]], and the [[Cold Run]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26/> These people were known as the [[Ice Hunters]] to distinguish them from the other Ulutiun tribes of the [[Great Glacier]].<ref name=RoF-p109> The easternmost Ulutiun tribes spoke the closely related [[Ulutiun language]],<ref name=D:SiT-p26/><ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}} although some scholars did not distinguish between the two tongues, calling both "Uluik".<ref name=RoF-p109/><ref name=FRCS-p85>

Folk of the [[Cold Lands]]&mdash;[[Damara]], [[Narfell]], and [[Vaasa]]&mdash;sometimes learned Uluik as a second language.<ref name=FRCS-pp30-32>

The [[Arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]], who had frequent contact with speakers of Uluik, often learned the language themselves.<ref name=RoF-p10>

==Script==
Uluik used the [[Thorass alphabet]]<ref name=FRCS-p85/>, but as of [[1372 DR]], this had only been a relatively recent acquisition.<ref name=RoF-p109/>

==Related languages==
Uluik, as was mentioned, was very closely related to the Ulutiun language. Being [[Ulou languages]], both were distantly related to [[Netherese language|Netherese]] and [[Damaran language|Damaran]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28/>

Uluik had strongly influenced the arctic dwarven dialect of [[Dwarvish#Kurit|Kurit]].<ref name=RoF-p10/>

==Examples==
Common examples of Uluik names for males included Aklar, Hilur, Liruk, Namiir, Selmik, Uknar, Tirmuk, and Wariik. An Ulutiun female might be named Chamuk, Iirkik, Kagiik, Lelchik, Nirval, Talchuk, Valiir, or Wenvik. The Ulutiun peoples did not use surnames.<ref name=FRCS-p12>
