In the Elemental Evil Players Companion, it is stated that Aarakocra player characters can "...speak, read, and write Common, Aarakocra, and Auran." This would imply that Aarakocra, much like the other two languages, has some form of writing script.
The Aarakocra language was the racial language of aarakocras, a race of intelligent bird-like people.
Beyond aarakocras themselves, Aarakocra was a common secondary language among jungle druids, specialty priests in the Church of Ubtao, who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived around the Chultan Peninsula.
This language consisted in part, though not entirely, of a variety of clicks, trills, and whistles.
Coliar Aarakocra A dialect spoken by the aarakocra of the planet Coliar. Beyond the native aarakocra themselves, it was a common secondary language among elves of the Elven Imperial Fleet.
Malatran Aarakocra A dialect spoken by the aarakocra of the Malatran Plateau.
The Aarakocra tongue included a word for "gargoyle", one of their sworn foes, that loosely translated to "flying rock".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
Aaarakocran names typically featured two to four syllables. Clicks, trills, or whistles acted as the connectors between these syllables.
