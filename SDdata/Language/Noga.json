        "mainbody": "oga was the language of the ancient kingdom of Nog in the Ruined Kingdoms.\nCompared to Midani, Noga had a cadence that seemed strange to those not fluent in it.\nAs late as 1367 DR, Noga could still be heard amidst the bazaars of the mainland Ruined Kingdoms, though Midani was the official language by that time.\nNoga was in the Midani languages subgroup, being related to the Midani tongue spoken in Zakhara. This placed it also in the Untheric group of Rauric languages."
