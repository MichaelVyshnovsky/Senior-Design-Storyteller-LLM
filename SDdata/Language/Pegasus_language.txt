The '''Pegasus language''' was the racial language of [[pegasi]].

==Speakers==
Beyond pegasi themselves, Pegasus was a common secondary language among many members of [[Faer√ªn]]'s land dwelling [[elf|elven]] subraces, such as the [[lythari]], [[moon elves]], [[sun elves]], and [[wood elves]].

Pegasus was also fairly common as a secondary language among [[druid]]s devoted to certain nature deities. [[Druid (Eldath)|druids]] of [[Eldath]], [[Druid (Mielikki)|druids]] and druid/[[ranger]]s of [[Mielikki]], and the druids of [[Silvanus]]. Other forms of [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms for whom Pegasus was a commonly known secondary language included the Eldathyn [[peacemen]].
