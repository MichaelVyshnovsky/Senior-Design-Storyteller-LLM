'''Halardrim''' was a dead language in the [[Raumtheran languages]] group by the 14th century [[DR]].<ref name=D:SiT-p29>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==History==
It was once spoken in the northlands of [[Rashemen]], and some of its words were still present in the [[Rashemi language]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Rashemi & Jotun Languages ... Need Some Help.|author=[[Thomas M. Costa]]|topicid=20231|postid=470450|whichpage=1|date=2015-06-13|accessdate=2015-08-24}} It was considered an ancient dialect of Rashemi.

Scholars observed that Halardrim had had a strong influence on [[Gurri]], the patois of the nomadic [[Gur]]s,<ref name=D:SiT-p29/> who were generally believed to be of [[Rashemi]] descent.
