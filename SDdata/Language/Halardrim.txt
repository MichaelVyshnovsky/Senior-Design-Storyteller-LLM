Halardrim was a dead language in the Raumtheran languages group by the 14th century DR.
It was once spoken in the northlands of Rashemen, and some of its words were still present in the Rashemi language. It was considered an ancient dialect of Rashemi.
Scholars observed that Halardrim had had a strong influence on Gurri, the patois of the nomadic Gurs, who were generally believed to be of Rashemi descent.
