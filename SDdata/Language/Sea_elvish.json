        "mainbody": "Sea elvish, or sea elven, was a distinct dialect of the Elven language spoken by sea elves.\nBeyond the sea elves themselves, and malenti. And though they could not speak it themselves, the dialect was comprehensible to some dolphins and whales.\nSome of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Sea Elvish. These included the waveservants of Umberlee and the waterwalkers of Istishia.\nWhile spoken Sea Elvish was quite recognizable as being related to Elvish, it was distinct enough to make the dialect not immediately understandable by the other elven races, which could result in momentary language barriers. However, like other Elvish dialects, most of it could usually be understood by the other elven subraces. It also incorporated interspersion of clicks, squeals, and whistles, similar to those used in the language of dolphins.\nJust like standard Elvish, Sea Elvish used the Espruar alphabet. It had a distinctive style to it, which displayed influences from Aquan.\nKarpri Sea Elvish A dialect of the language spoken by the sea elves of the planet Karpri. Beyond the native sea elves themselves, it was a common secondary language among elves of the Elven Imperial Fleet.\nSerusan a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Ser√¥s, featured elements of Sea Elvish.\nThe spell aura of the sea would automatically translate any spoken Sea Elvish into Common for those also standing within the aura.\n* Ashakar Piscelene, a triton wizard, was capable of speaking and understanding this language."
