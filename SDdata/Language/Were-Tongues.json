        "mainbody": "The Were-Tongues or Were-Tongues of Lycanthropy was a general term to refer collectively to the racial languages of lycanthropes.Though it is not outright stated in the text, it can be assumed that these racial languages belong to and are used by the natural or true lycanthropes, those who were born with the condition, rather than something thats inherently learned upon being infected or cursed with lycanthropy. Every type of lycanthrope had its own distinct racial language. These languages were not mutually intelligible, thus weretigers could not speak the language of werebears and vice-versa.\n* Sea druids, a type of specialty priest in the Church of Deep Sashelas, were known to learn various other aquatic languages. These included those of aquatic lycanthropes, such as weresharks."
