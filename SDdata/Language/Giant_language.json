        "mainbody": "The Giant language, or Giantish, also called Jotun by those who spoke it, was the ancient language of most giants. It was one of the oldest active languages. It was believed that the language shared some of its roots with Common and Thorass.\nBoth ancient and modern Giant was written with Dethek runes. although they were also used symbolically in art to represent or refer to related giant subraces and gods. These runes did not make up a true alphabet or syllabary, but rather they were diagrams or models of the relationships between cosmic forces and the deeper truths of the universe.\nJotun tended to follow a subject&ndashverb&ndashobject order, but there were exceptions. The copula, er, was often left out of sentences.\nThe plural forms of nouns varied depending on the declension. For example, the plural of jotun (\"giant\") was jotunen, while the plural of huslyd (\"family\") was huslyder.\nScholars have determined that verb forms in Jotun were inflected, that is, they changed form depending on the subject of the sentence. For example, the verb fer, \"to go\", was known to have at least the following forms\nThe participial form ferd derived from the verb and meant \"going\" or \"journey\".\nThe infinitive form, fer, was used in commands, e.g., Fer zu dun heim, \"Go to your home.\"\nThe subjective forms, as known, are shown below\nThe following were the known objective forms\nThe known possessive forms were as follows\nThe two demonstrative pronouns were i and det, \"this\" and \"that\", respectively. The interrogative pronouns included wo (\"what\"), wer (\"who\"), and wie (\"where\").\nThe cardinal numbers in Jotun are listed below\nNumbers after ten were formed simply by following ten with the next digit, as in tier et, that is, there was no separate word for eleven. 20 and 30 were represented with to tier and tre tier. Similarly, 2,345 would be represented as to tusen tre hund fir tier fem.\nThe only ordinal number known to scholars was stot, \"second\".\nBelieved by some to be derived from the Primordial language, the Giant tongue was taught to the giants by Annam All-Father. Not long after giant culture first began to flourish, the Dwarvish script Dethek was adopted for transcribing Giantish.\nJotunstein had strong Auld Dwarven influences. And both Thorass and, to an extent the, Common tongue of Faer√ªn were thought to share lingual roots with Jotun, possibly having evolved from an even more ancient giant language.\nOnly about 1% of giants had any significant knowledge of the ancient giant runes in 1366 DR. By the late 14th century DR, a few giants were familiar with the rune commonly associated with their subrace and the runes were still used by giant runecasters. Most ancient dragons were also familiar with the large majority of these runes. \nThere are several languages and dialects based on Jotun that have evolved from it.\nJogishk This is the patois spoken by ogres.\nJotunalder Similar enough to Jotun to be reasonably understood, this language has not changed in thousands of years and is used formally in ceremonies.\nJotunhaug Spoken by hill and mountain giants, and closely related to Jotunise.\nJotunild Spoken by fire giants.\nJotunise Spoken by frost giants and closely related to Jotunhaug.\nJotunskye The language used by cloud and fog giants.\nJotunstein Spoken by stone giants.\nJotunuvar Spoken by storm giants.\nKara-Turan hill giant A dialect spoken exclusively by the hill giants of Kara-Tur, such as the coombe giants."
