The gnomish language, also known as Gnim, was spoken by the gnomes.
Gnim had a simple structure and fluid tones. Most gnomes had a truly daunting vocabulary, however, with extremely fine degrees of distinction in, for example, kinds of love or shades of green. Their language was thus ideal for academic, artistic, and engineering pursuits, and it was widely used in academic circles even among other races. Many sages of many races considered Gnim to be a "scholars language."
Gnim utilized an adapted version of the Dethek alphabet, and gnomish writings and literature covered a staggering variety of topics.
