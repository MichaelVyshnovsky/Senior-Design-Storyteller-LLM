Roushoum, also called Imaskari, was the ancient language of the Imaskari people. 
Roushoum continued to be spoken deep in the Underdark by the survivors of the Imaskari Empire, the Deep Imaskari. It was subsequently spoken by the High Imaskari who ruled over Mulhorand in the 15 century DR.
Roushoum was the major language of the Imaskari languages family. Its many varied descendants included the languages of the Durpari and the various Tuigan dialects, including Raumvira. It had strong influences on the Rauric family of languages as well.
The modern variations of Roushoum spoken in the Hordelands were broken down into three subgroupings of languages for convenience the Northern, Southern, and Eastern Imaskari languages.
Roushoum was written using the Imaskari alphabet.
