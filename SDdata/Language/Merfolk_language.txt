The Merfolk language or Merman language was the language spoken by merfolk.
Beyond merfolks themselves, Merfolk was a common secondary language among sea elves and asrai, water sprites of the Upper Planes.
Some of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Merfolk. These included the sea druids of Deep Sashelas, the waveservants of Umberlee, and the waterwalkers of Istishia.
Serusan, a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Serôs, featured elements of the merfolk language.
The spell aura of the sea would automatically translate any spoken Merfolk into Common for those also standing within the aura.
