Aragrakh was the second oldest of the Draconic languages, emerging sometime before the First Sundering. It was descended from Auld Wyrmish and a precursor to the Draconic tongue spoken in the Present Age.In many of the cited sources author Ed Greenwood confusingly uses the term "Auld Wyrmish" interchangeably as another name Aragrakh or a distinct precursor language. In order to reconcile these discrepancies, Ed Greenwoods description of Aragrakh as the "later, more everyday and widespread language" is selectively used on this article to infer what sources using the term "Auld Wyrmish" are in fact referring to Aragrakh.
Aragrakh saw more widespread and everyday use than Auld Wyrmish, continuing to see use well into the mid-14 century DR. By 1372 DR, Aragrakh had become considered an "ancient" language that only saw use among wyrms and great wyrms, the oldest ages of dragons.
For much of history, this language was spoken by all varieties of dragons on Toril, acting as a sort of universal language to communicate across species. By the late 14 century DR, when the language had largely fallen into disuse outside of wyrms and great wyrms, among the few younger generations of dragons to study the language were the members of the blue dragon clan Blood of Morueme.
Beyond dragons themselves, Aragrakh was learned by most members of the Cult of the Dragon and sometimes known by sun elves, as many sun elves sought to learn dead languages like Aragrakh so as to increase their access to ancient works.
Auld Wyrmish was also somewhat common as a secondary language among some specialty priests in the Realms, more specifically those who tended towards learning the tongues of dragons or other monstrous creatures. These included the noroghor of Abbathor, the wyrmkeepers of Tiamat, and the wyrmlairds of Tchazzar.
Aragrakh lacked any regional dialects, but the various racial dialects that each dragon species possessed was derived from it.
Oum Kouram
"Peerless Ruler"
Oum Or
"Supreme One"
Osvithien
"Sanctuary"
Auld Wyrmish included a word for "mold".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
For much of its existence, Aragrakh was written in the same script as its precursor, Old Draconic. At some point the language transitioned into instead using the same draconic script alphabet used by modern Draconic.
