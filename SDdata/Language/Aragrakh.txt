'''Aragrakh''' was the second oldest of the [[:Category:Draconic languages|Draconic languages]],{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-02-24 - Draconic Language Tree Theory Confirmed & Draconic names for Draconic}} emerging sometime before the [[First Sundering]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-03-16 - Emergence of Aragrakh}} It was descended from [[Auld Wyrmish]] and a precursor to the [[Draconic language|Draconic tongue]] spoken in the [[Present Age]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-01-30 - Etymology of Abeir and Toril}}<ref group="note" name="identity">In many of the cited sources author [[Ed Greenwood]] confusingly uses the term "Auld Wyrmish" interchangeably as another name Aragrakh or a distinct precursor language. In order to reconcile these discrepancies, Ed Greenwood's description of Aragrakh as the "later, more everyday and widespread language" is selectively used on this article to infer what sources using the term "Auld Wyrmish" are in fact referring to Aragrakh.

Aragrakh saw more widespread and everyday use than Auld Wyrmish,{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-02-23 - Relation of Arragrakh to Auld High Wyrmish}} continuing to see use well into the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By [[1372 DR]], Aragrakh had become considered an "ancient" language that only saw use among [[wyrm]]s and [[great wyrm]]s, the oldest ages of dragons.<ref>

==Speakers==
For much of history, this language was spoken by all varieties of dragons on [[Toril]], acting as a sort of universal language to communicate across species. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, when the language had largely fallen into disuse outside of wyrms and great wyrms, among the few younger generations of dragons to study the language were the members of the [[blue dragon]] clan [[Blood of Morueme]].<ref>

Beyond dragons themselves, Aragrakh was learned by most members of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and sometimes known by [[sun elves]],<ref> as many sun elves sought to learn dead languages like Aragrakh so as to increase their access to ancient works.

Auld Wyrmish was also somewhat common as a secondary language among some [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms, more specifically those who tended towards learning the tongues of dragons or other monstrous creatures. These included the [[noroghor]] of [[Abbathor]], the [[wyrmkeeper]]s of [[Tiamat]], and the [[wyrmlaird]]s of [[Tchazzar]].

==Derivations==
Aragrakh lacked any regional dialects,{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-03-16 - Emergence of Aragrakh}} but the various racial dialects that each dragon species possessed was derived from it.

===Unknown Words===
Auld Wyrmish included a word for "[[mold]]".<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Twilight of the Dirty Turtles|8}}<ref group="note" name="word">What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.

==Writing System==
For much of its existence, Aragrakh was written in the same script as its precursor, [[Old Draconic]]. At some point the language transitioned into instead using the same [[draconic script]] alphabet used by modern Draconic.
