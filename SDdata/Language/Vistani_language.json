        "mainbody": "The '''Vistani language''', which was properly called the '''patterna''', was the common language spoken by most [[Vistani]]. It was a creole language, being a mixture of words from [[Common]], several [[humanoid]] languages, and unique slang. It was considered rather complex, owing to it being conveyed by context and intonation rather than by straight definitions or root words. It was also composed of many concepts,<ref> phrases, and words that had no direct translations into Common or other tongues. And many ordinary words in Common had no direct translations into patterna. Because of all this, there existed no comprehensive [[book]]s on Vistani vocabulary or translation.",
