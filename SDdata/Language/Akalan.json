        "mainbody": "Akalan was the original tongue of the Arkaiuns.\nBy 1367 DR, Akalan was a language used by most of the population of Dambrath.\nThe Arkaiuns of the outlaw Swagdar wastes spoke a Swag creole dialect of Akalan.\nThe language was used by traders across Durpar and Var the Golden and possibly even as far as Zakhara.The sourcebook Land of Fate says that the western trading posts of Zakhara use the language Akotan. Considering how Dambrath often traded with Zakhara, it may be that Akotan is an another dialect, alias, or mistranslation for Akalan. Tom Costa adds validity to this assumption in a post on the Candlekeep Forum. His post is cited here."
