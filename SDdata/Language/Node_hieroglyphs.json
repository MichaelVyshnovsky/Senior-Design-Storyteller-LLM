Far from a simple alphabet, hieroglyphs were closer to a complex cipher, the meaning of the symbols varying from one document to the other. Sages theorized that this was due to the alien way the spellweaver brain worked, encoding information in complex patterns incomprehensible to other creatures.\nThe spellweaver alphabet was made of at least 29 symbols.\nthumb|center|300px|The alphabet used to write words.\nSpellweavers used two different numeric systems.A senary number system, or \"base-6\" number system, only uses numbers from 0 to 5. Counting in base-6 looks like this \"0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, ...\"\nThey also developed a decimal numeral system to work with other races, such as the nerra.\nthumb|center|300px|Symbols of the senary (top) and decimal (bottom) numeric systems used by the spellweavers.\nthumb|center|300px|Example of numbers using both the senary system (left), the decimal system (center), and the common alphabet (right)."
