        "mainbody": "The Merfolk language or Merman language was the language spoken by merfolk.\nBeyond merfolks themselves, Merfolk was a common secondary language among sea elves and asrai, water sprites of the Upper Planes.\nSome of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Merfolk. These included the sea druids of Deep Sashelas, the waveservants of Umberlee, and the waterwalkers of Istishia.\nSerusan, a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Serôs, featured elements of the merfolk language.\nThe spell aura of the sea would automatically translate any spoken Merfolk into Common for those also standing within the aura.\nAmtola\n \"traveler\".\nHeumixumlis\nThe merfolk term for anguiliians. Translated literally, it meant \"eel man from the deep\".\nSerôs\n The undersea realms of the Inner Sea. Translates literally as \"the embracing life\".\n* Ashakar Piscelen, a triton wizard in Ravens bluff, was capable of speaking this language.\n* Clark Pebble, a half-elf fighter and former sea captain, was capable of speaking this language.\n* Kladdin Frivil, a human swashbuckler and wizard in Ravens bluff, was capable of speaking this language.\nThose standing within the aura of the aura of the sea spell would hear merfolk language translated into Common."
