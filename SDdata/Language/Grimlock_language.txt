The grimlock language was the spoken language seemingly unique to grimlocks, a species of underground-dwelling humanoids that isolated themselves from other races in the Underdark. It was technically a dialect of two other languages common among subterranean beings, Terran and Undercommon.
The parent languages of the grimlock dialect were commonly spoken throughout Fingerhome, an expansive series of caves the grimlock race regarded as their home.
