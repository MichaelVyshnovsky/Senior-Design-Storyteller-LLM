The Slaad language, also referred to as Slaadi, was the racial language of the slaadi.
Beyond the slaadi themselves, some githzerai and planewalkers learned the Slaadi tongue as a secondary language.
Slaadi had a runic writing system.
* The Slaad language included a word for "death", which was notably written in glowing runes across the slaad lord Ygorls scythe.The text states that the runes are written across the handle, yet the accompanying illustration shows them to be on the blade of Ygorls scythe.
* Grazzt, one of the demon princes of the Abyss.
* Loru, a death slaad who masqueraded in Daggerford as a monk of the Old Order.
* Worldwalker, a sentient sword of the planes, spoke the Slaad language.
