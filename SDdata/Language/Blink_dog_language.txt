The '''Blink Dog language''' was the racial language of [[blink dog]]s, an intelligent breed of [[dog|canines]].{{Cite dragon/228/Greater Familiars of Faer√ªn|81}}

==Phonology==
Blink Dog was an entirely verbal language, lacking any sort of writing system.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-01-27 - Blink Dog, Hook Horror, and Yeti Languages}} Being that blink dogs were canines, the language consisted largely of various barks, growls, whines, and yaps. Despite its outward simplicity, Blink Dog was considered to be a complex language, capable of communicating intricate information.
