The descriptive term "'''High Ulutim'''" referred to two closely related [[Ulou languages]]<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}} spoken in the northernmost ("high") reaches of [[Faerûn]] by the [[Ulutiun]] people.<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Languages==
The High Ulutim languages were [[Uluik]] and [[Ulutiun language|Ulutiun]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28/> Both languages were very closely related, and some scholars did not recognize Ulutiun as a language in its own right, calling both High Ulutim languages "Uluik".<ref name=FRCS-p85> The [[Ulutiun]] people could similarly be split into two distinct cultural groups&mdash;those living on the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] were called the "[[Ice Hunters]]"<ref name=RoF-p109> and spoke Uluik;<ref name=D:SiT-p26/> those living on the [[Great Glacier]] were the "Ulutiun"<ref name=RoF-p109/> and spoke Ulutiun.<ref name=D:SiT-p26/>

==Script==
By [[1372 DR]] Uluik and Ulutiun had only recently begun using the Thorass script, if writing was used at all.<ref name=FRCS-p85/><ref name=RoF-p109/>
