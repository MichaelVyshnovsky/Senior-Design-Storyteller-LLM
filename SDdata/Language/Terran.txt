'''Terran''' was the language of creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] or those otherwise related to the earth in some way. Many earthsoul [[genasi]] learned the language as well. When written, it used the [[Dethek]] script.

==Description==
Terran is a rumbling language with deep tones that reverberate through the listener.<ref name=MotP-p71>

It was considered a dialect of [[Primordial language|Primordial]], so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as [[Aquan]], [[Auran]] or [[Ignan]] could understand Terran and vice-versa.
