It comprised the Issacortae, Pazruki, and Wu-haltai languages, named for the nations that spoke them Issacortae, Pazruki, and Wu-haltai.Only the Issacortae and Pazruki languages are specified as part of the Amaese languages group. It is assumed that the language of the Wu-haltai people, also indigenous to the Ama Basin and sharing cultural similarities with the Issacortae and Pazruki, is also a part of the Amaese languages group.\nEach of these languages was a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The three nations had little writing or centralization, so each language developed independently.\nThese languages were considered to be \"only vaguely related\" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group."
