The Central Thorass language subgroup included Chondathan and Common and a large number of their lesser-known derivative languages and dialects.
Despite the name, the parent language of the languages in this group was Jhaamdathan, or "Old Chondathan". Modern Chondathan derived directly from Old Chondathan, while Thorass/Old Common, the original trade language of Faer√ªn, was a mixture of Alzhedo and Jhaamdathan. Common was simply a modern version of Thorass.
From Thorass sprang a number of lesser-known languages and dialects, including
* Northern
* Auld Cormanthan
* Cormanthan
* "Maidens Tongue"
All the languages in this group used the Thorass alphabet.
