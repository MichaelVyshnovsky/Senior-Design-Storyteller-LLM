The Jermlaine language was the racial language of jermlaines, a small malicious race of subterannean dwelling fey within the gremlin family of fey creatures.
Beyond jermlaines themselves, Jermlaine was somewhat common as a secondary language among the demihumans of Faer√ªn that tended to live subterranean or in the Underdark, such as drow, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and svirfneblin.
This language had a cadence reminiscent of bats or rats, characterized by high-pitched squeaks and twitters, a consequence of jermlaines having small vocals.
The Jermlaine tongue included a word for "footache".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
