        "mainbody": "Aglarondan was a regional tongue of East Faerûn and the official language of Aglarond.\nAglarondan was spoken from Dahst in the north to the Yuirwood in the south, and from Ingdals Arm in the west to Glarendar in the east. Elves of Sildëyuir and the Yuirwood spoke Aglarondan fluently.\nAglarondan used the elven alphabet of Espruar, which was rare for human languages.\nSome scholars placed Aglarondan in the broad Thorass language family, along with such languages as  was  as Common, Chondathan, and Turmic. Other scholars argued that Aglarondan had more similarities with Damaran, an Ulou language, than with the other Thorass tongues. (Nearly two-thirds of humans in Aglarond were Damarans.) All scholars were in agreement, however, that Aglarondan was strongly influenced by the Elven language, as it had many Elven loan words (especially of green elf origin) and used the Elven alphabet.\nCommon Aglarondan surnames included Aengrilor, Dulsaer, Gelebraes, Jacerryl, Telstaerr, and Uthelienn. Typical first names for men included Aelthas, Courynn, Folcoerr, Gaedynn, Mourgram, Sealmyd, and Yuiredd. Women might have names like Blaera, Courynna, Lynneth, Maera, Mourna, or Wydda.\n\"Simbul\", one of the other titles of Alassra Silverhand, the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, quite literally means \"watchful warrior-wizard\" in Aglarondan."
