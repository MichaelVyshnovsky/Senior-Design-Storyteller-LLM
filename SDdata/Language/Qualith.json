It could be written on [[parchment]], in [[book]]s, or carved into surfaces. Degradation of the material could cause the message to fade over time.\n\nQualith was extremely difficult to read for non-illithids and usually required [[magic]] such as a ''[[comprehend languages]]'' spell to decipher because each of the four lines of script modified the others and only when taken as a whole was the full meaning understandable. Readers attempting to non-magically decipher the message, if successful, could gain insight on the writer's thoughts, its meaning, and even who the message was intended for. Failure, however, could drive the reader mad, or at least leave them with a bad headache.\n\nSome specially trained [[dwarves]] known as ''caradhakers''{{Cite dragon/245/Mindstalkers|37}} (which loosely translates to \"mindstalker\") were said to be able to grasp the basic meaning (but not the nuances) by running four fingers over the striations.{{Cite dragon/245/Mindstalkers|41}}"
