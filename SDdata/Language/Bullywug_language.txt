The '''Bullywug language''' was the racial language of [[bullywug]]s, a race of [[frog]]-like [[humanoid]]s.

==Speakers==
Beyond bullywugs themselves, Bullywug was somewhat common as a secondary language among [[warrior]]s in [[Hlondeth]].<ref>  It was also a common secondary language among [[jungle druid]]s, [[specialty priest]]s in the [[Church of Ubtao]], who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived in [[Chult]]'s jungles and swamps.<ref>

==Phonology==
The Bullywug tongue consisted of a series of clicks, croaks, and staccato notes. Though considered by some to be a rather crude or primitive language, it allowed Bullywugs communicate over large distances, spreading news quickly across their territory.
