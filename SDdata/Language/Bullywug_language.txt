The Bullywug language was the racial language of bullywugs, a race of frog-like humanoids.
Beyond bullywugs themselves, Bullywug was somewhat common as a secondary language among warriors in Hlondeth.  It was also a common secondary language among jungle druids, specialty priests in the Church of Ubtao, who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived in Chults jungles and swamps.
The Bullywug tongue consisted of a series of clicks, croaks, and staccato notes. Though considered by some to be a rather crude or primitive language, it allowed Bullywugs communicate over large distances, spreading news quickly across their territory.
