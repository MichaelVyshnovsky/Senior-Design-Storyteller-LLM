While spoken Sea Elvish was quite recognizable as being related to Elvish, it was distinct enough to make the dialect not immediately understandable by the other elven races, which could result in momentary language barriers. However, like other Elvish dialects, most of it could usually be understood by the other elven subraces. It also incorporated interspersion of clicks, squeals, and whistles, similar to those used in the language of dolphins.
Just like standard Elvish, Sea Elvish used the Espruar alphabet. It had a distinctive style to it, which displayed influences from Aquan.
