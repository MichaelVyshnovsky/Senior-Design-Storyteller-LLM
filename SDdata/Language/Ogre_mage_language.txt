Ogre Magi was the racial language of ogre mages.
Beyond ogre mages themselves, Ogre Magi was the primary language spoken by ogres throughout Kara-Tur and in the Northern Wastes.
The Wu-haltai language, the native tongue of the Wu-haltai, had many points in common with Ogre Magi. These similarities likely arose from the proximity of ogre tribes within the Ama Basin region of the Northern Wastes.
Ogre Magi included a word for "dragons".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
