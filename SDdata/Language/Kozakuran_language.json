        "mainbody": "Kozakuran was a language spoken by the Kozakuran people, inhabitants of the realm of Kozakura in Kara-Tur.\nKozakuran descended from the ancient Han language, as did Koryo and Wa-an, and possibly others.\nIt was considered a sophisticated language, thanks to the high level of literacy in Kozakura and the frequent publication of poetry and plays there. Popular plays regularly introduced new accents and phrasesâ€”within a few weeks, a popular new play could change common greetings across the country, which could just as quickly be replaced."
