'''Thayan''' was a language spoken by the inhabitants of [[Thay]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} It was also known as '''Thayian'''.{{Cite comic/Converging Lines}}

==Description==
As one of the [[Mulhorandi languages]], Thayan was highly inflected, and word order was of only minor importance. It sounded thick and slow to speakers of many other languages.

==Script==
In their earliest forms, the Mulhorandi languages used a [[wikipedia:en:Logogram|logographic system]] of writing, which included pictographs to represent concepts. Over the millennia, the written forms of the languages were simplified yet still contained tens of thousands of pictographs. as a direct insult to the god-kings of neighboring [[Mulhorand]], who used the [[Celestial alphabet|Celestial]] script. A century later, they had switched to using the [[Thorass alphabet]].

==History==
Thayan was so closely related to [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]] that many scholars considered them a single language. Both languages were in the [[Mulani languages]] group within the [[Rauric languages]] family.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}
