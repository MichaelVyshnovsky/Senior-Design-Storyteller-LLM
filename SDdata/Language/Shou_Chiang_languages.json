The Shou Chiang languages group comprised the Kao te Shou, Tu Lung, Khazari, and Ra-Khati languages.The Tu Lung language is not mentioned as among the Shou Chiang languages in The Horde, but it may be assumed to be as Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms and other sources establish it to be closely related to the language of Shou Lung. Of them, Kao te Shou and Tu Lung came from same root tongue.This root language may be called \"Shou Chiang\", which is said in the The Horde to be the main language of Shou Lung, yet is used as the name of the group of languages that descend from it.\nThe languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.\nThe Shou Chiang languages heavily influenced the Eastern Imaskari languages.\nShou Chiang was also the name of the written language of Shou Lung."
