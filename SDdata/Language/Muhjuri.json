Each people group spoke its own dialect. It was associated with the Muhjein or Muhjari culture of Durpar and Semphar.\nThe Semphari dialect of Muhjuri utilized its own unique script.\nScholars classified the Muhjuri tongue as one of the Mulani languages, which implies that the language may have developed when Murghôm and Semphar were under the control of Mulhorand after the collapse of Imaskar. In any case, the language also influenced and was influenced by Naican and the two Southern Imaskari languages Tuigan and Dalat."
