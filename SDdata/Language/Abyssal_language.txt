The abyssal language was the language of demons. 
It was a form of the Primordial language warped and twisted by the evil of the Abyss. 
Lower-ranking demons spoke using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sounded like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of a swarm of angry hornets. As with everything involving the tanarri, however, their speech was unpredictable, and sometimes an elite balors words were rougher or a lowly bar-lguras words smoother.
Abyssal used the Infernal languages script or the Barazhad alphabet.
