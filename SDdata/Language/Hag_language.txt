Some scholars believed that hags were descended from ogres, or at the very least that annis hags and ogre mages were somehow related. As a consequence, it was believed by some scholars that Annis was an offshoot of Ogrish and that those knowledge in the latter could potentially understand bits and pieces of conversations conducted in Annis.
