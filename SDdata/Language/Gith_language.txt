The '''Gith language''' was the language spoken by all [[Gith (race)|gith]], both [[githyanki]] and [[githzerai]].

==Dialects==
Gith had two main dialects and accents: one spoken by the githyanki, and the other by the githzerai.

==Speakers==
Beyond the gith themselves, this language was commonly known by the [[lillendi]], though they spoke only the githyanki dialect.<ref> And some [[planewalker]]s learned either dialect of Gith as a secondary language.<ref>

==Writing System==
[[File:Vlaakith_tir'su.jpg|thumb|200px|''The tir'su for the word "[[Vlaakith]]", githyanki dialect.'']]
The main writing system of the Gith language was called [[tir'su]]. It consisted of arranging each word as a circular pattern, also called a tir'su, with each letter constituting a "spoke" of the wheel. Sentences and phrases were formed by connecting several individual tir'su.

The two Gith dialects differed not only in the accent, but also in the usage of the writing system. In the githyanki dialect, each word was written clockwise, starting from the top. The githzerai dialect started each word from the bottom, filling the wheel counter-clockwise.

==Notable Speakers==
* [[Graz'zt]], one of the [[demon prince]]s of the [[Abyss]], spoke both dialects of Gith.<ref>
* ''[[Worldwalker]]'', a [[sentient item|sentient]] ''[[sword of the planes]]'' that was owned by the githyanki hr'a'cknir [[Tropos]], spoke both dialects of Gith.{{Cite dungeon/43/Into The Silver Realm|69}}
