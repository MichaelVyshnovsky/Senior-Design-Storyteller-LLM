'''Loross''' was the [[Netherese]] noble tongue<ref name=FRCS85> and one of the languages of the people of the [[Thultanthar|City of Shade]].<ref name=LEoF-p96>

==Speakers==
During the empire of [[Netheril]], the [[Netherese]] people were divided by class. The nobles lived in High Netheril, in the floating cities above, while most commoners and the middle class lived in Low Netheril on the ground below. The nobles spoke Loross, while the commoners and inhabitants of Low Netheril spoke its sister language [[Netherese language|Netherese]].<ref name=RoF-p107>

High Netheril fell in {{Yearlink|-339}}, and the majority of Loross' speakers died in that catastrophe.<ref name=RoF-p107/> By [[1372 DR]], Loross was considered a dead language. It was considered unlikely that anyone alive at that time knew its proper pronunciation.<ref name=FRCS85/> However, in that same year, the [[Thultanthar|City of Shade]] returned from the [[Plane of Shadow]].<ref name=FRCS99> ("Thultanthar" meant "shade" in Loross.<ref name=LEoF-p109>) Its inhabitants were remnants of the ancient Netherese city of Thultanthar,<ref name=LEoF-p100> so presumably, its rulers, who became the [[shade]]s,<ref name=FRCS280-281> spoke Loross.<ref name=LEoF-p96/>

In addition to the shades, all members of the [[Cultist of the Shattered Peak|Cult of the Shattered Peak]], a secret society dedicated to preventing Netherese magic from being rediscovered, were required to speak Loross.<ref name=LEoF-p10>

==Script==
Loross, like Netherese, used the [[Draconic script]].<ref name=FRCS85/><ref name=LEoF-p96/> Outside the City of Shade, Loross could still be found in the tomes of archwizards found in the ruins of High Netheril in the desert.<ref name=LEoF-p96/>

==Related languages==
Like Netherese, Loross was related to the [[Halruaan language|Halruaan]] tongue.<ref name=LEoF-p96/>
