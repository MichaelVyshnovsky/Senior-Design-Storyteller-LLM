'''Primordial''' was the language of [[primordial]]s and [[elemental]]s. The [[Abyssal language]] was a form of Primordial warped and twisted by the evil of the [[Abyss]]. And some believed the [[Giant language]] was a debased form of it, though it had actually been taught to the [[giant]]s fully formed by their creator god [[Annam]].<ref>

It was also considered a language family, so that the elemental languages [[Aquan]], [[Auran]], [[Ignan]], and [[Terran]] were considered a group of dialects of Primordial. They were sufficiently similar that creatures who understood one of those dialects could understand the others as well.

Primordial used the [[Barazhad]] script or the [[Dethek|Dwarvish]] script.
