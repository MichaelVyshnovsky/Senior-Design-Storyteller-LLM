'''Naric''' was a language spoken by the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]], from [[Icelace Lake]] in the north to [[Rawlinswood]] in the south, and from the [[Giantspire Mountains]] in the west to the [[Icerim Mountains]] in the east.<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} It was one of the [[Low Ulutim languages]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}} It was presumably derived from the ancient language of [[Narfelli language|Narfelli]].<ref group="note">Narfelli is not mentioned in the "Speaking in Tongues" article of [[Dragon Magazine Annual 1999|''Dragon'' 1999 Annual]], yet Naric is. It is possible that Naric and Narfelli are the same, yet ''[[Races of Faerûn]]'' makes it clear that Narfelli is a dead language, while the ''Dragon'' article indicates that Naric is still spoken, so it is assumed here that they are considered distinct languages.

Most Nars also spoke [[Damaran language|Damaran]].<ref name=RoF-p107>
