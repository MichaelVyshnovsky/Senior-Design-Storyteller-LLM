The '''Will-o'-wisp language''' was an entirely optical language used by [[will-o'-wisp]]s, [[nyth (creature)|Nyths]], and variants found in the [[Domains of Dread]], such as [[will o'deep]]s and [[will o'sea]]s.

==Description==
Described by some as merely a "flickering light" language, will-o'-wisps and its other "speakers" conveyed ideas through changing the color and or the brightness or intensity of their light-based bodies.

The alien and subtle nature of this language made it largely incomprehensible to the average [[human]], [[demihuman]], and most other creatures. It was considered by many to be impossible to mimic, though some swamp-based [[druid]]s managed to somewhat communicate in the language through the use of light sources, such as a [[hooded lantern]].<ref>
