        "Relations and Education": "This language descended from the ancient [[Han language]], as did [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran]] and [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]], and possibly others. Its vocabulary comprised many words evolved from the old Han tongue, as well as loanwords from Wa-an and [[Kao te Shou]] that had been borrowed over centuries. Koryo's vocabulary was very different to that of Kozakuran, but its grammar was very similar. Koryo sounded more like Wa-an than Kao te Shou, but it was as simple to use as Shou.\n\nThus, most folk of [[Shou Lung]], [[Wa]], and even [[Kozakura]] found the Koryo language relatively easy to pick up, and most Koryoans in turn found Kao te Shou, Wa-an, and Kozakuran easy to learn as well. It was easy to find Koryoan translators for many languages, though few learned Kozakuran, owing to enmity between the peoples. The basics of Koryo could be taught in four to six weeks, and fluency could be acquired in three months if one was dedicated.",
