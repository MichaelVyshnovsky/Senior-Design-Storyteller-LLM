        "mainbody": "oryo was a language spoken by the Koryoan people, who were the inhabitants of the kingdom of Koryo in Kara-Tur.\nThis language descended from the ancient Han language, as did Kozakuran and Wa-an, and possibly others. Its vocabulary comprised many words evolved from the old Han tongue, as well as loanwords from Wa-an and Kao te Shou that had been borrowed over centuries. Koryos vocabulary was very different to that of Kozakuran, but its grammar was very similar. Koryo sounded more like Wa-an than Kao te Shou, but it was as simple to use as Shou.\nThus, most folk of Shou Lung, Wa, and even Kozakura found the Koryo language relatively easy to pick up, and most Koryoans in turn found Kao te Shou, Wa-an, and Kozakuran easy to learn as well. It was easy to find Koryoan translators for many languages, though few learned Kozakuran, owing to enmity between the peoples. The basics of Koryo could be taught in four to six weeks, and fluency could be acquired in three months if one was dedicated.\nchoson\nmorning calm (as in Choson)\ndo bak\n a type of training uniform\nhojyko yada\n mountain badger (nickname of So Golin-po)\nlui do-pah\n dragons teeth (as in the Dragons Teeth)\ntu ohmna\n evening mist (as in The Evening Mist Inn)\nvioontu\n evening swallow that calls death (as in the Vioontu)\nwhakai choun\n lord of high water (nickname of Crow Dz Pong)"
