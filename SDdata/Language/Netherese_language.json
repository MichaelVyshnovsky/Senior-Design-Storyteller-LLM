(Loross, its sister language, was spoken by the nobles of High Netheril.)\nWhile by 1374 DR, Netherese had not been commonly spoken for thousands of years, small pockets of Netherese speakers did still survive, particularly among the shades and Shadovar of the Anauroch desert.\nNetherese used the Draconic script known as Iokharic.\nThe Netherese language was one of the oldest known human languages, dating back to two or three thousand years before the beginning of the Dalereckoning. It was part of the Ulou language family, which also included Ulutiun and Damaran.\nThe term \"Netherese\" was also used by scholars to refer to Netherese and those languages derived from it, namely, Halruaan and Ruathlek.\nWhile Halruaan and Ruathlek were the direct linguistic descendents of Netherese, several other common languages bore traces of the Netherese tongue, including Chondathan, Damaran, Illuskan, and Tethyrian.\nThe ruins of Low Netheril in the Anauroch desert were covered in Netherese writing, and Netherese words were often used as \"command words\" for magic items.\nturodahel the power of discretion"
