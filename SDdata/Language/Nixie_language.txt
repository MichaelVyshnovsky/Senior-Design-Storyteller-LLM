The Nixie language was the racial language of nixies, a type of fey.
Beyond nixies themselves, Nixie was a common secondary language among asrai, water sprites of the Upper Planes. Nixie was also common among some druids, particularly druids devoted to the nature god Eldath. Other forms of specialty priests in the Realms for whom it was a commonly known secondary language were Eldathyn peacemen and the waterwalkers of Istishia.
