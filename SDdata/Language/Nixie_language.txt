The '''Nixie language''' was the racial language of [[nixie]]s, a type of [[fey]].

==Speakers==
Beyond nixies themselves, Nixie was a common secondary language among [[asrai]], water sprites of the [[Upper Planes]]. Nixie was also common among some [[druid]]s,<ref> particularly [[Druid (Eldath)|druids]] devoted to the nature god [[Eldath]]. Other forms of [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms for whom it was a commonly known secondary language were Eldathyn [[peacemen]] and the [[waterwalker]]s of [[Istishia]].
