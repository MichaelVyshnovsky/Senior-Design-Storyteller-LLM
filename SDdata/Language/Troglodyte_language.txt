The Troglodyte language, a simplified form of Draconic, was the racial language of troglodytes. Troglodytes themselves referred to the language as Glav, which meant "speech" in the Draconic tongue.
Troglodyte used a much simpler vocabulary than base Draconic.
Troglodyte was among the common racial languages of the Underdark. Thus it was not uncommon for there to be speakers among the demihumans of Faer√ªn that tended to live in the Underdark, such as drow, duergar, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and svirfneblin. It was also common among the hybrid race tren and gray druids, a variety of druids that were associated with the Underdark.
Above ground, Troglodyte was somewhat common as a secondary language among warriors in Hlondeth and in the Chultan Peninsula by the jungle druids of the the Church of Ubtao.
Tren Trens, being that they were crossbreeds between troglodytes and lizardfolk, occasionally spoke their own creole language derived from combining the Troglodyte and Lizardman tongues.
Uvech A word used when referring to something owned by troglodytes, made by troglodytes, or that was of troglodyte culture. Translates literally as "ours", "us", and "of us".
Vechrand The name troglodytes use to refer to themselves. It was derived from two words in the Draconic tongue, "versvech" and "arand", which meant "strong" and "core" or "heart of" respectively.
The Troglodyte tongue included a word for "broken glass".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
