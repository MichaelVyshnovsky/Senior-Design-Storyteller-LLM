The '''Giant language''', or '''Giantish''', also called '''Jotun''' by those who spoke it, was the ancient language of most [[giant]]s. It was one of the oldest active languages. It was believed that the language shared some of its roots with [[Common]] and [[Thorass language|Thorass]].

==Script==
Both ancient and modern Giant was written with [[Dethek]] runes. although they were also used symbolically in art to represent or refer to related giant subraces and gods. These runes did not make up a true alphabet or syllabary, but rather they were diagrams or models of the relationships between cosmic forces and the deeper truths of the universe.

==Grammar==
Jotun tended to follow a subject&ndash;verb&ndash;object order, but there were exceptions. The copula, ''er'', was often left out of sentences.

===Nouns===
The plural forms of nouns varied depending on the declension. For example, the plural of ''jotun'' ("giant") was ''jotunen'', while the plural of ''huslyd'' ("family") was ''huslyder''.

===Verbs===
Scholars have determined that verb forms in Jotun were inflected, that is, they changed form depending on the subject of the sentence. For example, the verb ''fer'', "to go", was known to have at least the following forms:
{|
! 
! sing.
! pl.
|-
| 1{{st}}
| &mdash;
| &mdash;
|-
| 2{{nd}}
| ''ferst''
| &mdash;
|-
| 3{{rd}}
| ''fers''
| &mdash;
|-
|}

The participial form ''ferd'' derived from the verb and meant "going" or "journey".

The infinitive form, ''fer'', was used in commands, ''e.g.'', ''Fer zu dun heim,'' "Go to your home."

===Pronouns===
The subjective forms, as known, are shown below:
{|
! 
! sing.
! pl.
|-
| 1{{st}}
| align="center" | ''Am''
| &mdash;
|-
| 2{{nd}}
| align="center" | ''du''
| ''deg''
|-
| 3{{rd}}
| 
{|
! masc.
! fem.
! neut.
|-
| ''han''
| ''hun''
| ''den''
|-
|}
| &mdash;
|-
|}

The following were the known objective forms:
{|
! 
! sing.
! pl.
|-
| 1{{st}}
| ''meg''
| &mdash;
|-
| 2{{nd}}
| ''du''
| &mdash;
|-
|}

The known possessive forms were as follows:
{|
! 
! sing.
! pl.
|-
| 1{{st}}
| ''meg''
| ''su''
|-
| 2{{nd}}
| ''dun''
| &mdash;
|-
|}

The two demonstrative pronouns were ''i'' and ''det'', "this" and "that", respectively. The interrogative pronouns included ''wo'' ("what"), ''wer'' ("who"), and ''wie'' ("where").

===Numbers===
The cardinal numbers in Jotun are listed below:
{|
| 1
| ''et''
|-
| 2
| ''to''
|-
| 3
| ''tre''
|-
| 4
| ''fir''
|-
| 5
| ''fem''
|-
| 6
| ''sek''
|-
| 7
| ''sju''
|-
| 8
| ''att''
|-
| 9
| ''ni''
|-
| 10
| ''tier''
|-
| 100
| ''hund''
|-
| 1,000
| ''tusen''
|-
|}

Numbers after ten were formed simply by following ten with the next digit, as in ''tier et'', that is, there was no separate word for eleven. 20 and 30 were represented with ''to tier'' and ''tre tier''. Similarly, 2,345 would be represented as ''to tusen tre hund fir tier fem''.

The only ordinal number known to scholars was ''stot'', "second".

==History==
Believed by some to be derived from the [[Primordial language]], the Giant tongue was taught to the giants by [[Annam All-Father]]. Not long after giant culture first began to flourish, the Dwarvish script Dethek was adopted for transcribing Giantish.

Jotunstein had strong [[Dwarvish|Auld Dwarven]] influences. And both Thorass and, to an extent the, Common tongue of Faer√ªn were thought to share lingual roots with Jotun, possibly having evolved from an even more ancient giant language.<ref>

Only about 1% of giants had any significant knowledge of the ancient giant runes in [[1366 DR]].{{Giantcraft date}}<ref> By the late 14th century DR, a few giants were familiar with the rune commonly associated with their subrace and the runes were still used by giant runecasters.<ref> Most ancient dragons were also familiar with the large majority of these runes. 

==Derivatives==
There are several languages and dialects based on Jotun that have evolved from it.

;[[Jogishk]]: This is the patois spoken by [[ogre]]s.{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|29}}
;Jotunalder: Similar enough to Jotun to be reasonably understood, this language has not changed in thousands of years and is used formally in ceremonies.
;[[Hill giant language|Jotunhaug]]: Spoken by [[hill giant|hill]] and [[mountain giant]]s, and closely related to Jotunise.
;Jotunild: Spoken by [[fire giant]]s.
;Jotunise: Spoken by [[frost giant]]s and closely related to Jotunhaug.
;Jotunskye: The language used by [[cloud giant|cloud]] and [[fog giant]]s.
