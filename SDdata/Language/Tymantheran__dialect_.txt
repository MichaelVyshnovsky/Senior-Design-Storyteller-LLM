'''Tymantheran'''  was a regional [[Draconic language|Draconic]] dialect spoken by the [[dragonborn]] of [[Tymanther]]. Tymantheran words sounded softer than normal Draconic, a little more nasal and with words that had elongated syllables.<ref group="note">As seen in the novels of the [[Brimstone Angels series]]. There were words in Tymantheran that had no direct translation in the [[Common]] tongue.

Tymantheran dialect was based on the '''Aklave''', the [[Draconic_language#Dialects|draconic dialect]] from [[Abeir]], rather than from its [[Toril]]ian variant.As, according to the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]], Tymantheran dragonborn were native from Abeir until the [[Spellplague]] brought them to Toril.

===History===
It was considered by the dragonborn that they had "stolen" the language of the [[dragon]]s during their years of slavery.
