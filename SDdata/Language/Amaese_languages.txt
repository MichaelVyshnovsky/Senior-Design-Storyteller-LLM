The Amaese languages were a group of languages spoken by the tribes of the Ama Basin in northern Kara-Tur, and were the primary languages there. It comprised the Issacortae, Pazruki, and Wu-haltai languages, named for the nations that spoke them Issacortae, Pazruki, and Wu-haltai.Only the Issacortae and Pazruki languages are specified as part of the Amaese languages group. It is assumed that the language of the Wu-haltai people, also indigenous to the Ama Basin and sharing cultural similarities with the Issacortae and Pazruki, is also a part of the Amaese languages group.
Each of these languages was a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The three nations had little writing or centralization, so each language developed independently.
These languages were considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.
