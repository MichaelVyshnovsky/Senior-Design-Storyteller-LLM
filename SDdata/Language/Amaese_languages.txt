The '''Amaese languages''' were a group of languages spoken by the tribes of the [[Ama Basin]] in northern [[Kara-Tur]], and were the primary languages there. It comprised the [[Issacortae language|Issacortae]], [[Pazruki language|Pazruki]], and [[Wu-haltai language|Wu-haltai]] languages, named for the nations that spoke them: [[Issacortae]], [[Pazruki]], and [[Wu-haltai]].<ref group="note">Only the Issacortae and Pazruki languages are specified as part of the Amaese languages group. It is assumed that the language of the Wu-haltai people, also indigenous to the Ama Basin and sharing cultural similarities with the Issacortae and Pazruki, is also a part of the Amaese languages group.

Each of these languages was a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The three nations had little writing or centralization, so each language developed independently.

These languages were considered to be "only vaguely related" to the [[Eastern Imaskari languages]] group.
