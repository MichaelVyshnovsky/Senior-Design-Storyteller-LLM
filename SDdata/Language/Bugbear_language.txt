The Bugbear language was the racial language of bugbears, one of the many races of goblinoids.
Perceived by other creatures as being a rather uncouth language, Bugbear consisted of a variety of different grunts, snarls, and gestures.
Beyond bugbears themselves, Bugbear was a common secondary language among some specialty priests, such as the Authlim of Iyachtu Xvim and the Dreadmasters of Bane.
