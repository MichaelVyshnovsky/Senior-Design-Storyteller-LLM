The '''Bugbear language''' was the racial language of [[bugbear]]s, one of the many races of [[goblinoid]]s.

==Description==
Perceived by other creatures as being a rather uncouth language, Bugbear consisted of a variety of different grunts, snarls, and gestures.

==Speakers==
Beyond bugbears themselves, Bugbear was a common secondary language among some [[specialty priest]]s, such as the [[Authlim]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] and the [[Dreadmaster]]s of [[Bane]].<ref>
