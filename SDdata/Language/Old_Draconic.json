        "Derivations": "* The trade tongue of the [[sarrukh]] used a script that utilized a smattering of [[Thorass language|Thorass]] and quite significantly Old Draconic. This same script was later used to write the ''[[Nether Scrolls]]''.\n* For much of [[Toril]]'s history, mages wrote their [[spell]]s in an everchanging \"pidgin language\" or \"jargon\" derived from Old Draconic, utilizing many of its articles and verbs. This script was augmented by various runes or sigils, which individually carried their own meanings and magical charges. Around 12% of the language in total consisted of words borrowed from Old Draconic.",
