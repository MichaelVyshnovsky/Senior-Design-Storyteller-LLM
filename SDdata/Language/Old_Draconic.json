This same script was later used to write the Nether Scrolls.\n* For much of Torils history, mages wrote their spells in an everchanging \"pidgin language\" or \"jargon\" derived from Old Draconic, utilizing many of its articles and verbs. This script was augmented by various runes or sigils, which individually carried their own meanings and magical charges. Around 12% of the language in total consisted of words borrowed from Old Draconic.\nDating back to as far as the Dawn Age, for much of Torils ancient history a variety of different cultures and creatures, including the giants, made some use of Old Draconic.This age can be inferred by Ed Greenwood naming \"the giant races, or the titans\" as the contemporary races that would have possibly utilized the Old Draconic script.\n* Filfaeril Obarskyr could read Old High Wyrm."
