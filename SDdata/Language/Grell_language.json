        "mainbody": "The Grell language was a bizzare language spoken exclusively by grells, a strange race of aberrations, though due to its alien nature other creatures considered it to be hardly recognizable as a language.\nThis language was exclusively known by grells,\nVerbally this language consisted of various buzzing rasps, clicks,In the Monstrous Manual, it is stated that grell utilize limited telepathy as part of their language. This aspect is not carried over in Lords of Madness The Book of Aberrations, however, the electrical component of Grell can be assumed to be mistaken for telepathy by other creatures due to its imperceptibly.\nIn order to conduct complex conversations in this language or to speak exclusively through its electrical component, grells had to be within  of one another. For communication from greater distances, only the audible component could be used. In ideal conditions, verbal speech in the Grell language could be carried for hundreds of feet.\nWhen it came to communicating exclusively through the audible or electrical component, grell typically did so in order to convey simple messages such as alarms, hunting signals, or calling for help. The electrical component component in particular was sometimes used to among grell to silently signal ambushes or to coordinate sudden attacks.\nThe word used to refer to \"lesser beings\" in Grell was synonymous with the word used to refer to \"food\".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text. Among colonial grell, that being the spacefaring grell of Wildspace, this same term was also used to refer to groundling grell, as they viewed themselves to be superior to their terrestrial cousins."
