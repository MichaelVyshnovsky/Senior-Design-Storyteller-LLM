The Ki-rin language was the racial language of ki-rins, a race of celestial creatures who otherwise spoke to all others through means of telepathy.
Beyond ki-rins themselves, this language was spoken in a rudimentary fashion by dragon horses.
The Ki-rin tongue included a word for "trap".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.
* Sir Emelyn the Gray, a human wizard who lived in the Bloodstone Lands in the 14 century DR, learned the ki-rin language in his old age sometime before the Bloodstone Wars.
