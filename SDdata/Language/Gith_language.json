And some planewalkers learned either dialect of Gith as a secondary language.\nthumb|200px|The tirsu for the word \"Vlaakith\", githyanki dialect.\nThe main writing system of the Gith language was called tirsu. It consisted of arranging each word as a circular pattern, also called a tirsu, with each letter constituting a \"spoke\" of the wheel. Sentences and phrases were formed by connecting several individual tirsu.\nThe two Gith dialects differed not only in the accent, but also in the usage of the writing system. In the githyanki dialect, each word was written clockwise, starting from the top. The githzerai dialect started each word from the bottom, filling the wheel counter-clockwise.\n* Grazzt, one of the demon princes of the Abyss, spoke both dialects of Gith.\n* Worldwalker, a sentient sword of the planes that was owned by the githyanki hracknir Tropos, spoke both dialects of Gith."
