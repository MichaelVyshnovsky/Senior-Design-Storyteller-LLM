Some of the elves of the Forest of Lethyr, Sildëyuir, and the Snow Eagle Aerie also spoke this tongue. Planetouched humans from Mulhorand sometimes learned the language as well. Even so, Rashemi was usually only spoken regularly within the borders of Rashemen, and in fact, of all those of the Rashemi ethnicity living in Faerûn, more spoke Thayan Mulhorandi than spoke Rashemi.\nIn addition to Sylvan, the spirit folk in the region of Lake Ashane spoke Rashemi as their primary language.\nRashemi employed the Thorass alphabet, which was introduced to Rashemen by Chondathan traders traveling along the Golden Way.\nRashemi was in the Raumtheran languages group, the collection of languages originating in the Raumathari Empire. It was derived primarily from Raumvira\nCommon female given names in Rashemi include Fyevarra, Hulmarra, Immith, Imzel, Navarra, Shevarra, Tammith, and Yuldra.
