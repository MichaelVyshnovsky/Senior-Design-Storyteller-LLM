'''Ra-Khati''', or '''Ra-Khatian''', was the language spoken by the people of [[Ra-Khati]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

It was of the [[Shou Chiang languages]] group, being related to the [[Kao te Shou]] and [[Khazari language]]s. The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.

Ra-Khati was slightly influenced by the Solonese dialect of [[Devic]], spoken in [[Solon]].

In Ra-Khatian, the title [[Dalai Lama]] meant "ocean spirit father" while the name [[Sandiraksiva]] translated to "He who refuses to carry the Dalai Lama". "Nyum" was a Ra-Khatian concept combining spirit, courage, and audaciousness, most similar to [[Wikipedia:Chutzpah|chutzpah]].
