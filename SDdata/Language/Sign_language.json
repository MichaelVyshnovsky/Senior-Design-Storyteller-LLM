        "mainbody": "A '''sign language''' was a system of communication involving hand and other gestures. They were used by [[deaf]] and mute people and those who learned it to communicate with them, and by people wishing to communicate in silence or secrecy. Several different forms of sign language were used on [[Toril]].<ref group=\"note\">Sign languages have been mentioned a number of times in ''Forgotten Realms'' sources, but have not always been named or described. As such, it is unclear if they should be treated as the same, similar, or unrelated sign languages, while some are confirmed to be unique. For convenience, this article collects these various unnamed sign languages together. Named and unrelated sign languages are detailed on their own pages. Basic signals and instances of improvised signing, such as by miming, are not included. Such forms of communication were also called '''silent languages'''.",
