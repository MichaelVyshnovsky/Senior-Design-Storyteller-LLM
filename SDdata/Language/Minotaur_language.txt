The '''Minotaur language''' was the racial language of [[minotaur]]s.

==Speakers==
Beyond minotaurs themselves, Minotaur was a common secondary language among some [[specialty priest]]s, such as the [[Authlim]] of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] and the [[Dreadmaster]]s of [[Bane]].<ref>

==Phonology==
Minotaur had some similarities to the [[Ogre language]], to such an extent that proficiency in either tongue could allow one to quickly pick up the intricacies of someone speaking the other.{{Cite dragon/116/Ecology of the Minotaur|32-35}}
