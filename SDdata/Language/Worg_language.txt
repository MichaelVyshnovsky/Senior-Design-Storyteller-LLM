The Worg language was the racial language of worgs, a species of magical canines with moderate intellect.
The Worg tongue was limited in many respects, being a primitive language.
Beyond worgs themselves, their primitive language was known by some fellow intelligent canine species, namely barghests and winter wolves.
* Holly Harrowslough, a paladin of Lathander, could speak Worg to a rudimentary degree.
