Thus it was not uncommon for there to be speakers among the demihumans of Faerûn that tended to live in the Underdark, such as drow, duergar, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and svirfneblin. On the surface, it was a common secondary language among sea elves of the Inner Sea.\nSome of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities, who were known to learn the languages of various aquatic races, commonly knew Kuo-toan. These included the waveservants of Umberlee and the waterwalkers of Istishia.\nSerusan, a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Serôs, featured elements of Kuo-toan.\nBa-Plagoop\n A title within kuo-toan society for those who were purely clerics roughly translated to \"Pincers of the Priest-King\".\nBa-Poolgol\n A  title within kuo-toan society for those who ruled kuo-toan cities roughly translated to \"Priest-Prince\".\nkaparl\n \"slave\".
