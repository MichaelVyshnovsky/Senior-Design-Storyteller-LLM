        "mainbody": "upernal was a language of the gods. It was a universal language, understandable by any sentient mind (which heard the words as if they were spoken in its own languages).\nThe gods shared the Supernal language with their servants, the angels, and devils spoke a version of it as well. Mortals were unable to learn the language completely, so the words of creation lacked power, and they were unable to use Supernal to make themselves understood by those who spoke only other languages.\nStrangely, despite being neither celestial nor infernal, astral dreadnoughts were capable of understanding and/or speaking the language.\nSupernal had its own hieroglyphic script."
