These included the sea druids of Deep Sashelas, the waveservants of Umberlee, and the waterwalkers of Istishia. It was also a common secondary language among jungle druids, specialty priests in the Church of Ubtao, who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived around the Chultan Peninsula.\nThe language of the sahuagins was difficult for most surface dwellers to understand without some magical aid, as it involved a combination of body language and sounds made through the gills.\nSerusan, a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Ser√¥s, featured elements of the sahuagin language.\nKuaumin\n \"malenti\".
