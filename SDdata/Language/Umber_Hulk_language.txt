The '''Umber Hulk language''', also known as '''Hulkish''',{{Cite dragon/152/Ecology of the Umber Hulk|11}} was the racial language of [[umber hulk]]s, a relatively intelligent subterannean race.

==Description==
Umber Hulk was a rather brutal language, conveying only limited information in a direct and concrete fashion. It was relatively easy for other creatures to learn and understand, but it was difficult to actually speak, as non-insectoids couldn't effectively reproduce the sounds made by umber hulks. Additionally, the language was often suplemented with various gestures, grunts, and hisses to add emphasis. Such gestures included movements of the mouth, mandibles, and eyes.

==Derivations==
