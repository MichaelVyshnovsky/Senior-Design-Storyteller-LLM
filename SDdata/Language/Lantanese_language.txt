Lantanese, also known as Lantanna,
Other regions where Lantanese was commonly spoken included the Nelanther Isles and Tethyr.
Literate Lantanese speakers used the Draconic alphabet. Scholars suspected that the Lantanna people learned of this language through trade with early Halruaan or Nimbrali traders.
Some scholars classified Lantanna as an Imaskari language,Tom Costa placed Lantanna in the Imaskari languages grouping in his "Speaking in Tongues" Dragon article based on the suggestions of Eric L. Boyd and others that the Lantanna people descended from the Imaskari, but this has not been established as canon. See 
Common female names in Lantanese were Avilda, Bersace, Charissa, Melsany, Phaerilda, Ravace, and Umbrasy. Male names might be Eberc, Fodoric, Koger, Lambrac, Midoc, Norbert, Samber, or Tibidoc. Common Lantanese surnames included Angalstrand, Decirc, Lamstrand, SeKorc, SeLangstra, and SeMilderic.
