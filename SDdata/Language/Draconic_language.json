        "mainbody": "Draconic was the language of dragons. It used its own distinct alphabet, called Iokharic. Other native speakers included members of draconic-related races, such as kobolds and dragonborn, and members of reptilian races such as lizardfolk and troglodytes. The language was commonly used for arcane writings, so it was commonly learned by elves and wizards.\nDraconic was one of the earliest languages, influencing or creating the language of kobolds and other races.  \nWhile believed by some to be a monolithic language that had remained almost unchanged since its creation, in reality the language had developed and changed over time. The oldest precursor to the language was known as Auld Wyrmish, followed by Aragrakh.\nEvery subspecies of dragon possessed their own dialects that could be considered separate languages in their own right. Slight variations in the dialect of Draconic were used among the different kinds of chromatic dragons, and were considered equivalent to regional accents. Metallic dragons on the other hand all had similar accents.\nThe dragons of Abeir (including those living in Laerakond) also had their own dialect, which they called Aklave ( Dracohydras also had their own dialect, derived from those of the chromatic dragons. There were enough similarities between these dialects that chromatics and dracohydras could understand roughly half of what the other was saying.\nDraconic was a language of hard consonants and sibilants that usually sounded like hissing when spoken, like sj, ss, and sv. It also included a sound similar to a creature clearing its throat, ach. \nDraconic words were emphasized on the first syllable, and speakers of Draconic expressed important ideas by stressing the beginnings and the ends of words. Dragons often used this when referring to themselves, or when they wanted to command, warn, threaten, or otherwise make their point clear.\nWords that modified other words were placed before or after the word they modified, with the most important modifier always placed before. Draconic speakers often placed it a second time directly after the word for additional emphasis. Draconic had no specific word for “my” or “mine,” instead using several prefixes that depended on the exact meaning.\nthumb|The Iokharic script.\nAll Draconic languages used a script known as Iokharic, though there existed a misconception among some that none but gold dragons had a written language. This script was likely created long after its spoken form was standardized, as dragons had little to no need to write when compared to other races.\nThe Iokharic alphabet was equivalent to that of human languages, with the same number of characters for letters and numbers."
