The Mulani languages group was one of the two major branches of the Rauric languages family and included languages spoken in East Faer√ªn by the Mulan people.In 3 edition, all of the Mulani languages are grouped together under Mulhorandi. This article attributes information provided about that language in later sources to the Mulani group as a whole, as the history of the people groups speaking these languages are also clearly outlined.
The Mulani languages were further subdivided into the Mulhorandi and Muhjuri branches.
The Mulani languages derived in part from a slave argot of one or more of the Imaskari languages. Over the millennia, the Mulani tongues remained more similar to their Rauric roots than did the Untheric languages.
