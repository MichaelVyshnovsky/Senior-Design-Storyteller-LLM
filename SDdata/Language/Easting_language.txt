Easting was a language spoken by the inhabitants of the Vast and Impiltur, from Mulmaster and the Icemelt Mountains in the north to Lyrabar in the south, and from Tantras in the west to Easting Reach in the east.
Many of the speakers of Easting also spoke Damaran, a closely related Chard language.
There were several dialects of Easting, including Impilturian (spoken in Impiltur), Mulman (from Mulmaster), Procampan (from Procampur), and Tantran (from Tantras).
