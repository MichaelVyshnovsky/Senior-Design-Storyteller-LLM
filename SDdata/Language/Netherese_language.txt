'''Netherese''' was a language spoken in [[Netheril]] both before and after [[Karsus's Folly]] in {{Yearlink|-339}}. Though it was considered a dead language by [[1372 DR]],<ref name=FRCS-p85> scholars believed that it evolved into the [[Halruaan language|Halruaan]] and [[Ruathlek]] languages.<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}}

==Speakers==
Netherese was the primary language of Low Netheril, but it was also spoken by commoners in High Netheril.<ref name=RoF> ([[Loross]], its sister language,<ref name=LEoF-p96> was spoken by the nobles of High Netheril.<ref name=RoF-p107/>)

While by [[1374 DR]], Netherese had not been commonly spoken for thousands of years,<ref name=FRCS-p85/> small pockets of Netherese speakers did still survive,<ref name=LEoF-p96/> particularly among the [[shade]]s and [[Shadovar]] of the [[Anauroch]] desert.<ref name=FRCS-p30><ref name=RoF-p148>

==Script==
Netherese used the [[Draconic language|Draconic]] script known as [[Iokharic]].<ref name=FRCS-p85/><ref name=RoF-p107/><ref name=LEoF-p96/>

==History and Legacy==
The Netherese language was one of the oldest known human languages, dating back to two or three thousand years before the beginning of the [[Marking the Years#Dalereckoning (DR)|Dalereckoning]].<ref name=FRCS-p84> It was part of the [[Ulou languages|Ulou language family]], which also included [[Ulutiun language|Ulutiun]] and [[Damaran language|Damaran]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28/>

The term "Netherese" was also used by scholars to refer to Netherese and those languages derived from it, namely, [[Halruaan language|Halruaan]] and [[Ruathlek]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28/>

While Halruaan and Ruathlek were the direct linguistic descendents of Netherese, several other common languages bore traces of the Netherese tongue, including [[Chondathan language|Chondathan]], Damaran, [[Illuskan language|Illuskan]], and [[Tethyrian dialects|Tethyrian]].<ref name=LEoF-p96/>

The ruins of Low Netheril in the [[Anauroch]] desert were covered in Netherese writing, and Netherese words were often used as "command words" for magic items.<ref name=LEoF-p96/>
