Pazruki, also called Pazruk, was a language spoken by the Pazruki of the Ama Basin. It was one of the chief languages of the region. 
Pazruki was related to Issacortae and Wu-haltai, other languages in the Amaese languages group.
As with the other Amaese languages, Pazruki was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.
It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Pazruki nation had little writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations. The two most prominent dialects were Tchaltin-Pazruk and Erla-Pazruk.
The Pazruki tongue was spoken largely by the Pazruki nation, who dwelled in the northern Koryaz Mountains. Other native speakers were the Pazruki-descended clans who inhabited the forests to the east and the forested hills lying further north.
A legendary race that ruled the land in ancient times was known as the Maraloi, which meant "ancient lords" in Pazruki.
