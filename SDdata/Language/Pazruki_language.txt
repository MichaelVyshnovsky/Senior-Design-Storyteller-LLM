'''Pazruki''', also called '''Pazruk''', was a language spoken by the [[Pazruki]] of the [[Ama Basin]]. It was one of the chief languages of the region. {{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Related languages==
Pazruki was related to [[Issacortae language|Issacortae]] and [[Wu-haltai language|Wu-haltai]], other languages in the [[Amaese languages]] group.

As with the other Amaese languages, Pazruki was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the [[Eastern Imaskari languages]] group.

==Dialects==
It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Pazruki nation had little writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations. The two most prominent dialects were Tchaltin-Pazruk and Erla-Pazruk.

==Speakers==
The Pazruki tongue was spoken largely by the Pazruki nation, who dwelled in the northern [[Koryaz Mountains]]. Other native speakers were the Pazruki-descended clans who inhabited the forests to the east and the forested hills lying further north.

==Terminology==
A legendary race that ruled the land in ancient times was known as the [[Maraloi]], which meant "ancient lords" in Pazruki.
