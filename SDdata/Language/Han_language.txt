Han was a language spoken by the ancient Han people of Kara-Tur.
Legend told that after the creation of the land of Kara-Tur, the gods themselves handed down the Han language to the Han people.
By the 14th century DR, Han was studied and employed only by philosophers and sages of Kara-Tur.
It was the root tongue for the Koryo, Kozakuran, and Wa-an languages, and possibly others.
