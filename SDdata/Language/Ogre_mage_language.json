        "mainbody": "gre Magi was the racial language of ogre mages.\nBeyond ogre mages themselves, Ogre Magi was the primary language spoken by ogres throughout Kara-Tur and in the Northern Wastes.\nThe Wu-haltai language, the native tongue of the Wu-haltai, had many points in common with Ogre Magi. These similarities likely arose from the proximity of ogre tribes within the Ama Basin region of the Northern Wastes.\nOgre Magi included a word for \"dragons\".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text."
