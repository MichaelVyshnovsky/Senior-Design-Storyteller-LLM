The '''Dolphin language''' was the language spoken by [[dolphin]]s, a highly intelligent aquatic species of mammal that inhabited the oceans of [[Toril]].

==Speakers==
Beyond dolphins themselves, the Dolphin was commonly known in the oceans of [[Zakhara]] by the [[pahari]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|32}} It was also a common secondary language among [[aquarian]]s and [[sea druid]]s, two types of [[specialty priest]]s in the [[Church of Deep Sashelas]]. Though of the two, it was the aquarians who specialized in the language.<ref>

==Phonology==
The dolphin language consisted of a series of clicks, squeals,

Much like [[whalesong]], the dolphin language was a pure-sound language. This was in contrast to the many languages based around verbal speech that were employed by [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, and [[humanoid]]s.&mdash;especially surface dwellers, who lacked the enhanced auditory and vocal capabilities of dolphins and whales.

==Derivative Languages==
[[Serusan]], a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of [[Serôs]], featured elements of both the dolphin language and [[elven language|aquatic elvish]]. The latter was not only noted for being somewhat akin to dolphin language, but many aquatic elvish poems and songs were said to mimic it in sound.

==Notable Speakers==
* [[Ashakar Piscelene]], a [[triton]] [[wizard]], was capable of speaking this language.<ref>
* [[Oel'yvia Reefglider]], a sea elven woman who worked as a barmaid at [[Bindle's Blade]], had an uncanny ability to sing in Dolphin and would occasionally entertain guests with her lyrical abilities.
* Some of the descendants of [[Selana]], a prophet among the [[merfolk]] of Serôs, were [[magic]]ally capable of understanding and speaking the Dolphin language.
