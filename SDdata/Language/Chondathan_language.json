        "Description": "Chondathan was similar to [[Common]], but it was far more expressive and complex in its grammar.",
        "Speakers": "The Chondathan tongue was spoken in and around [[Waterdeep]], in addition to the ubiquitous Common and the [[Sword Coast North|northern]] language of [[Illuskan language|Illuskan]]. Other regions where Chondathan was commonly spoken as a primary language included [[Amn]], [[Cormyr]], the [[Dalelands]], the [[Dragon Coast]], [[Sembia]], the [[Silver Marches]], [[Tethyr]], the [[Western Heartlands]], and the [[Vilhon Reach]]. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] of the [[Galena Mountains]] and the [[Spine of the World]] or within the [[Underdark]] sometimes spoke Chondathan, as did [[Elf|elves]] living in the [[Chondalwood]], [[Cormanthor]], the [[Elven Court]], [[Evereska]], [[Evermeet]], and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. [[Aarakocra]] from the [[Storm Horns]] also frequently spoke Chondathan as a second language.",
        "Dialects": "The variations of Chondathan spoken in different regions were sometimes named as distinct dialects.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note2\" /> Chondathan spoken in [[Northwest Faerûn]] was broadly termed '''Northern'''. It was spoken from the [[Ten Towns]] (Ten Towns [[wikipedia:en:Pidgin|pidgin]]/[[wikipedia:en:Patois|patois]]) in the north to [[The Way Inn]] in the south and from [[Neverwinter]] in the west to [[Llorkh]] in the east.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} Sub-dialects of Neveren-Waterdhavian, [[Nesmé]], [[Luruar]]an, and Llorkh were also named.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}}\n\nThe [[Shadow Thieves]] spoke a [[wikipedia:en:Cant (language)|secret language]] known as '''Shadow Cant''', which was an [[wikipedia:en:Argot|argot]] derived from the Northern dialect, from when the Shadow Thieves were based in Waterdeep. Shadow Cant included vocabulary from Amn, Tethyr, and the Underdark.\n\nThe '''Cormanthan''' dialect was the version of Chondathan spoken in Cormyr, the Dalelands, and Sembia, from [[Teshwave]] in the north to [[Proskur]] in the south, and from the [[Far Hills]] in the west to [[Elmwood]] in the east.\n\n'''Trade Pidgin''' was a mixture of Chondathan and other [[Thorass languages]] spoken in the Heartlands and around the Sea of Fallen Stars that integrated many military terms from Cormanthan after the invasion of the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]]. The version of Trade Pidgin spoken around the Inner Sea was strongly influenced by [[Easting language|Easting]]. The accent of the Heartlands speakers was so different from the accent of the Inner Sea speakers that the two groups had trouble understanding each other.\n\nAn older version of the Cormanthan dialect ('''Auld Cormanthan''') was spoken in the [[Great Dale]], from the [[Easting Reach]] in the west to [[Lake Ashane]] in the east and from the [[Dunwood]] in the north to the [[Forest of Lethyr]] in the south.\n\nFinally, '''Chondathian''' was the dialect of Chondathan actually spoken in the [[Chondath]] region, from [[Reth]] in the north to [[Elbulder]] in the south and from [[Arrabar]] in the west and [[Lotoli]] in the east.",
        "Script": "Like the majority of [[Faerûn]]'s regional tongues, it used the [[Thorass alphabet]].",
        "History": "Chondathan was a modern version of the ancient [[Jhaamdathan language]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note3\">[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' 3{{rd}} edition]] claims that Common derives from Chondathan, but this is overruled by the newer sourcebook, ''[[Races of Faerûn]]''. This made it a part of the [[Central Thorass languages|Central Thorass subgroup]] of languages.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\" />",
        "Examples": "Typical Chondathan surnames translated into such things as Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, and Tallstag. Girls might be named such things as Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, or Tessele, while boys might be named Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, or Stedd."
