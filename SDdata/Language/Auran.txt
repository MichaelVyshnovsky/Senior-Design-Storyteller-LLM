Auran was the language of the Elemental Plane of Air. It was also known as Old Alzhedo, as the modern Alzhedo language spoken in Calimshan derived from it.
Auran was a breathy, relaxed language that has been described as a slow exhaling of air.
It was considered a dialect of Primordial, so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as Aquan, Ignan or Terran could understand Auran and vice-versa.
Both Alzhedo and Midani derived from Auran.
In addition to creatures native to the Plane of Air, Auran was sometimes spoken by Air genasi and smoke drakes. Kenku could understand Auran, but could only produce speech through mimicry.
