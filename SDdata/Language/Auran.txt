'''Auran''' was the language of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].<ref name=MotP-p68> It was also known as '''Old Alzhedo''', as the modern [[Alzhedo]] language spoken in [[Calimshan]] derived from it.<ref name=D:SiT-p29>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Description==
Auran was a breathy, relaxed language that has been described as a slow exhaling of air.<ref name=MotP-p68/>

It was considered a dialect of [[Primordial language|Primordial]], so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as [[Aquan]], [[Ignan]] or [[Terran]] could understand Auran and vice-versa.

==Derivative Languages==
Both Alzhedo and [[Midani]] derived from Auran.<ref name=D:SiT-p29/>

==Speakers==
In addition to creatures native to the Plane of Air, Auran was sometimes spoken by [[Air genasi]]<ref name=FRCS-p9> and [[smoke drake]]s. [[Kenku]] could understand Auran, but could only produce speech through mimicry.
