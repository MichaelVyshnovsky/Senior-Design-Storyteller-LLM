The '''Tashalan''' language, called '''Akûrian''',{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} was a [[human]] language spoken in [[Tashalar]] and other parts of the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

==Speakers==
The Tashalan tongue was spoken in a region from [[Samarach]] in the west to the [[Mhair Jungle]]s in the east and from [[Narubel]] in the north to [[Mhairhetel]] in the south. This included such places as [[Thindol]], [[Tashluta]], and the [[Black Jungle]].{{cite book/Player's Guide to Faerûn|11-16}} and by some [[Wild elf|wild elves]].

Scholars counted at least three distinct dialects of Akûrian&mdash;'''Samarachian''', '''Tashlutar''', and '''Jungle Akûr'''.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Script==
Akûrian used the [[Dethek]] script of the [[Dwarf|dwarves]].

==History==
Akûrian was a member of the [[Akalaic languages]], a subgroup of the [[Chessan languages]] group. As such, it was related to such languages as [[Eshowan]], formerly spoken to the west in Chult, and [[Shaaran]], spoken in the east.

==Examples==
Female names in the Tashalan tongue might be Ayesha, Bhula, Lashela, Intingi, Mashai, Shevaya, Shesara, or Ushula. Common Akûrian male names were Angwe, Dumai, Gharbei, Indo, Masambe, Morife, Ngongwe, and Sepoto. For surnames, example names included Damarthe, Ghomposo, Ishivin, Jalamba, Konge, Maingwe, and Wasatho.
