'''Draconic''' was the language of [[dragon]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-02-24 - Draconic Language Tree Theory Confirmed & Draconic names for Draconic}} It used its own distinct alphabet, called [[Iokharic]]. Other native speakers included members of draconic-related races, such as [[kobold|kobolds]] and [[dragonborn]], and members of reptilian races such as [[lizardfolk]] and [[troglodyte]]s. The language was commonly used for arcane writings, so it was commonly learned by [[elves]] and [[wizard]]s.<ref>

==History==
Draconic was one of the earliest languages, influencing or creating the language of kobolds and other races.  

While believed by some to be a monolithic language that had remained almost unchanged since its creation, in reality the language had developed and changed over time. The oldest precursor to the language was known as [[Auld Wyrmish]], followed by [[Aragrakh]].

==Dialects==
Every subspecies of dragon possessed their own dialects that could be considered separate languages in their own right. Slight variations in the dialect of Draconic were used among the different kinds of chromatic dragons, and were considered equivalent to regional accents. Metallic dragons on the other hand all had similar accents.

The dragons of Abeir (including those living in [[Laerakond]]) also had their own dialect, which they called '''Aklave''' ({{Pronounce|AK|lavv|ref=As seen in the novels of the [[Brimstone Angels series]].

Dragonborn and kobolds had their own unique draconic dialects, the [[Tymantheran (dialect)|Tymantheran]] and the [[Yipyak]], respectively.{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|29}} [[Dracohydra]]s also had their own dialect, derived from those of the chromatic dragons. There were enough similarities between these dialects that chromatics and dracohydras could understand roughly half of what the other was saying.<ref>

==Phonology==
Draconic was a language of hard consonants and sibilants that usually sounded like hissing when spoken, like ''sj'', ''ss'', and ''sv''. It also included a sound similar to a creature clearing its throat, ''ach''. 

Draconic words were emphasized on the first syllable, and speakers of Draconic expressed important ideas by stressing the beginnings and the ends of words. Dragons often used this when referring to themselves, or when they wanted to command, warn, threaten, or otherwise make their point clear.

== Grammar ==
Words that modified other words were placed before or after the word they modified, with the most important modifier always placed before. Draconic speakers often placed it a second time directly after the word for additional emphasis. Draconic had no specific word for “my” or “mine,” instead using several prefixes that depended on the exact meaning.

==Writing system==

{{main|Iokharic}}
All Draconic languages used a script known as Iokharic, though there existed a misconception among some that none but [[gold dragon]]s had a written language.<ref> This script was likely created long after its spoken form was standardized, as dragons had little to no need to write when compared to other races.

===Alphabet===
The Iokharic alphabet was equivalent to that of human languages, with the same number of characters for letters and numbers.
