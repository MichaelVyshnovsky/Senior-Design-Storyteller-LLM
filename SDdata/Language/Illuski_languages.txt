The '''Illuski language group''' was a linguistic group that included the languages of the [[Northmen]]. Illuski languages were spoken in [[Ruathym]] and [[Luskan]] and from the islands as far north as the [[Uttersea]] south to the [[Moonshae Isles]] and [[Mintarn]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Languages==
Illuski languages included the following:<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}}
* [[Old Illuskan]] (dead language)<ref group=note>The "Speaking in Tongues" article in [[Dragon Magazine Annual 1999|''Dragon Annual'' #4]] includes a dead language called "Truskan" in its list of four Illuski languages, but nothing else is noted about it. ''[[Races of Faer没n]]'', however, goes into some detail about the dead parent language of Illuskan, called Old Illuskan. It is possible that Old Illuskan and Truskan are the same. In any case, Old Illuskan was certainly an Illuski language.

Like the majority of other [[Faer没nian languages]], modern Illuski languages made use of the [[Thorass alphabet]],<ref name=FRCS-p85>{{cite book/FRCS|85}} although Old Illuskan had its own script.<ref name=RoF-p94>
