Beyond sprites themselves, Sprite was a common secondary language in Faer√ªn among forest gnomes, lightfoot halflings, rock gnomes, and tallfellow halflings.

Non-sprite fey known for speaking the language included brownies, dobies, dryads and hamadryads, and gorse faeries. Beyond sylvan creatures, the Sprite language was commonly known by faerie dragons.
Sprite was also fairly common as a secondary language among most druids, including those devoted to certain nature deities. druids of Eldath, druids and druid/rangers of Mielikki, the druids of Silvanus, and the druids of Sheela Peryroyl. Other forms of specialty priests in the Realms for whom Sprite was a commonly known secondary language were the Eldathyn peacemen.
