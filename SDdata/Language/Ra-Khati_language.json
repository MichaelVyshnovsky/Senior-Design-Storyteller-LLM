        "mainbody": "Ra-Khati, or Ra-Khatian, was the language spoken by the people of Ra-Khati in Kara-Tur.\nIt was of the Shou Chiang languages group, being related to the Kao te Shou and Khazari languages. The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.\nRa-Khati was slightly influenced by the Solonese dialect of Devic, spoken in Solon.\nIn Ra-Khatian, the title Dalai Lama meant \"ocean spirit father\" while the name Sandiraksiva translated to \"He who refuses to carry the Dalai Lama\". \"Nyum\" was a Ra-Khatian concept combining spirit, courage, and audaciousness, most similar to chutzpah."
