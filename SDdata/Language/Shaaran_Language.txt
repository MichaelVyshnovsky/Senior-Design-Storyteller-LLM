Shaaran, also called Shaartan, was a regional language of Southern Faer√ªn, and the dominant language of the Shaaran people.
Besides the Shaar, other places where Shaaran was commonly spoken among humans included Amn, Calimshan, the Chondalwood, Chult, Dambrath, the Golden Water, Halruaa, the Lake of Steam, Lantan, Lapaliiya, the Nelanther Isles, Sembia, Sespech, Tashalar, Tethyr, Turmish, Unther, and the Vilhon Reach. It was also sometimes spoken among the gold dwarves of the Great Rift, the wild dwarves of Chult, the wild elves and wood elves of the Wealdath, and the halflings of Luiren.
Scholars divided Shaaran into several dialects, among them, Northern Laker, Southern Laker, True Shaartan, Reacher, Lapaliiyan, and Tharsult.
Speakers of the Shaaran tongue used the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves, which they learned from gold dwarven traders from the Great Rift before the rise of the Shoon Imperium.
According to some sources, Shaaran was one of the Akalaic languages, which were all part of the Chessan languages group. This made Shaaran distantly related to such languages as Chessentan.
Surnames in Shaaran were composed of multiple words. Common examples included Cor Marak, Hiaw Harr, Laumee Harr, Moq Qo Harr, Taw Harr, and Woraw Tarak. Common male names included Awar, Cohis, Damota, Gewar, Hapaw, Laskaw, Moktar, Senesaw, and Tokhis. A female might be named Anet, Bes, Dahvet, Faqem, Idim, Lenet, Moqem, Neghet, or Sihvet.
