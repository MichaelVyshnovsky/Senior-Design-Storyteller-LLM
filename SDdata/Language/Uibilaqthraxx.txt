'''Uibilaqthraxx''', also called '''the True Tongue''' by [[beholder]]s, was an ancient and disused language that influenced the modern [[Quevquel]] language of beholders.{{Cite dragon/418/Eye on the Realms: The High Priest of Beholders|56}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/01-28 - Miscellaneous Q&A}}

==History==
Uibilaqthraxx was one of several older beholder languages that fell into disuse. Much of Quevquel was derived from Uibilaqthraxx directly or indirectly, with lengthy and ornate True Tongue words shortened into their much quicker Speech forms.

The name of the beholder cult [[Daeth Haeromm]] was transliterated directly from Uibilaqthraxx, with the meaning of "Wise Gatherers."
