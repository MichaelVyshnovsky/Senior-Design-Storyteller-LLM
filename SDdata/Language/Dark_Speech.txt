'''Dark Speech''' was the secret language of evil [[god]]s, a language of such evil that even [[demon]]s and [[devil]]s avoided speaking it, for fear it might consume them. It was extremely difficult for mortals to learn even a single word of it, but each word was full of dread power that could be used to provoke emotions, empower magic, or corrupt physical objects. [[Fiend]]s found the language easier to learn than mortals did.
