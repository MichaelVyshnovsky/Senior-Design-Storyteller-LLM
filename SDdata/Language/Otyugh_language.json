        "mainbody": "he Otyugh language was the racial language of gulguthra, a variety of subterannean aberrations that included otyughs and neo-otyughs.\nMuch of this language was non-verbal in nature, with meanings being conveyed through such things as the movement of eye stalks, the movement of tentacles, or the emission of certain smells.\nBeyond otyughs and neo-otyughs, this tongue was somewhat common as a secondary language among the demihumans of Faer√ªn that tended to live subterranean or in the Underdark, such as drow, duergar, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and svirfneblin."
