The '''Otyugh language''' was the racial language of [[gulguthra]], a variety of subterannean [[aberration]]s that included [[otyugh]]s and [[neo-otyugh]]s.

==Description==
Much of this language was non-verbal in nature, with meanings being conveyed through such things as the movement of eye stalks, the movement of tentacles, or the emission of certain smells.

==Speakers==
Beyond otyughs and neo-otyughs, this tongue was somewhat common as a secondary language among the [[demihuman]]s of [[Faer√ªn]] that tended to live subterranean or in the [[Underdark]], such as [[drow]], [[duergar]], [[gold dwarves]], [[shield dwarves]], and [[svirfneblin]].<ref>
