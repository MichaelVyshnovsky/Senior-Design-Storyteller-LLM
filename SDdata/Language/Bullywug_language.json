It was also a common secondary language among jungle druids, specialty priests in the Church of Ubtao, who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived in Chults jungles and swamps.\nThe Bullywug tongue consisted of a series of clicks, croaks, and staccato notes. Though considered by some to be a rather crude or primitive language, it allowed Bullywugs communicate over large distances, spreading news quickly across their territory.\nYurk Yblorkflug\n\"Lord of fetid obliteration\" a name that the Blacktongue tribe of bullywugs used to refer to their leader, the death slaad Kuketh."
