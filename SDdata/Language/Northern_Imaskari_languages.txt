The Northern Imaskari languages were languages derived from Imaskari and spoken by the tribes of the northern parts of the Hordelands.
These languages rolled their rs and had broad, rounded vowels.
Most of the tribes speaking these languages were found along the westernmost edge of the Endless Waste.
This grouping usually included Commani, Khassidi, Naican, and Raumvira, but Naican was sometimes placed with the Southern Imaskari languages instead.
These languages were strongly influenced by the Raumatharan Empire,
