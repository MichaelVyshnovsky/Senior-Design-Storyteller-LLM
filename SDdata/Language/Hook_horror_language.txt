The '''hook horror language''' was a language spoken by [[hook horror]]s.

==Description==
The hook horror language consisted of a series of clicks and clacks that hook horrors made using their exoskeletons. The language sounded soft and gentle when "speaking" about friendship, but loud and frenzied when discussing food.{{Cite dragon/131/The Ecology of the Hook Horror|42-46}}
