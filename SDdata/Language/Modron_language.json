To humanoids, it sounded like a series of \"clicks and whirs\".\nSome planewalkers learned Modron as a secondary language, though it was considered to be more difficult to learn compared to some other planar languages.\nThere was no word in the Modron language for an individual to refer to itself in the single person. A modron always referred to itself as \"we\" or \"us\".\nThe Lawful Neutral tongue was believed to have derived from the Modron tongue."
