        "mainbody": "Mongrel was the pidgin language of mongrelfolk, derived from the Common tongue.The Monstrous Manual, The Complete Book of Humanoids, and Curse of Strahd describe mongrelfolk as not having their own \"distinct tongue\", but merely speaking a \"debased Common\" or \"fragmented Common\". However,  Drizzt DoUrdens Guide to the Underdark denotes them as having their own language.\nIn addition to elements of Common, Mongrel speech was interspersed with animalistic noises and cries, as well as gestures. These included growls, whistles, grunts, and howls. \nMongrelfolk given names often mimicked animal noises,"
