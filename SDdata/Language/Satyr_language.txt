The '''Satyr language''', sometimes referred to as the '''Faun language''', was the racial language of [[satyr]]s.<ref>

==Speakers==
Beyond satyrs themselves, Satyr was a common secondary language among many of [[Faer√ªn]]'s [[demihuman]] subraces. These included [[forest gnome]]s, [[lightfoot halfling]]s, [[lythari]], [[moon elves]], [[rock gnome]]s, [[sun elves]], [[tallfellow halfling]]s, and [[wood elves]].<ref> Beyond demihumans, Satyr was also commonly spoken by other [[fey]] creatures, such as [[hamadryad]]s, [[korred]]s, and the fey-associating [[bacchae]].

Satyr was also fairly common as a secondary language among most [[druid]]s,<ref> including those devoted to certain nature deities. [[Druid (Eldath)|druids]] of [[Eldath]], [[Druid (Mielikki)|druids]] and druid/[[ranger]]s of [[Mielikki]], the druids of [[Silvanus]], the druids of [[Sheela Peryroyl]], and the [[Druid (priest)|druids]] of [[Shiallia]]. Other forms of [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms for whom Satyr was a commonly known secondary language included the Eldathyn [[peacemen]] and the Shiallian [[woodwife|woodwives]].
