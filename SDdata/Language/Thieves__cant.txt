While some scholars believed thieves' cant was not a true language, it utilized a unique set of grammar,{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|7}} 

While it allowed for secret communication between rogues and thieves of the Realms, thieves' cant did not exist independent of other languages. It was impossible for two thieves to communicate in cant, if they did not have at least one shared language.

Thieves' cant was said to be somewhat similar in form to the language of the [[Vistani]] people.

===Syntax & Grammar===
Some iterations of thieves' cant had unique sets of rules that governed its word usage, syntax, modifiers and tenses. 

• A strict word order: words were placed in specific, except when the meaning of a sentence should be changed. The word order was: time — verb — subject — place — indirect object — direct object. <br />
• No use of adjectives: modifying words were used to alter the state of a noun or verb, in context to their place in a sentence, and the adjacent to them. Thieves' cant used pronouns as suffixes to modify a verb's subject, or to shift focus from the subject to the verb.<br />
• A unique form of pluralization and adjective magnitude: these were changed by repeating modifier words in rapid succession, in effect creating new words.<br />
• Specific rules regarding verb tense: tenses were changed by placing specific time modifiers at the front of a sentence or question.<br />

===Spoken===
Spoken thieves' cant utilized a narrower set of vowel sounds and elongated syllables. The first syllable of each word received primary stress, while odd syllables in longer words were given secondary stress.{{Cite dragon/66/Thieves' Cant|35-36}} Some variants of thieves' cant employed a series of animal noises.

===Written===
There was no unique alphabet for thieves cant, as it was rarely if-ever transcribed onto parchment or [[scroll]].

==Uses==
The main use of thieves' cant was to communicate illicit activities, such as banditry, burglary, finding marks, and the discussion of ill-gotten loot.
