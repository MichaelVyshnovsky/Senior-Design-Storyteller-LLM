'''Aglarondan''' was a regional tongue of [[East Faerûn]] and the official language of [[Aglarond]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Speakers==
Aglarondan was spoken from [[Dahst]] in the north to the [[Yuirwood]] in the south, and from [[Ingdal's Arm]] in the west to [[Glarendar]] in the east. [[Elf|Elves]] of [[Sildëyuir]] and the [[Yuirwood]] spoke Aglarondan fluently.

==Script==
Aglarondan used the elven alphabet of [[Espruar]], which was rare for human languages.

==History==
Some scholars placed Aglarondan in the broad [[Thorass languages|Thorass language family]], along with such languages as  was  as [[Common]], [[Chondathan]], and [[Turmic]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}} Other scholars argued that Aglarondan had more similarities with [[Damaran language|Damaran]], an [[Ulou languages|Ulou language]], than with the other Thorass tongues. (Nearly two-thirds of [[human]]s in Aglarond were [[Damaran]]s.) All scholars were in agreement, however, that Aglarondan was strongly influenced by the [[Elven language]], as it had many Elven loan words (especially of [[green elf]] origin) and used the Elven alphabet.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|27}}

==Examples==
Common Aglarondan surnames included Aengrilor, Dulsaer, Gelebraes, Jacerryl, Telstaerr, and Uthelienn. Typical first names for men included Aelthas, Courynn, Folcoerr, Gaedynn, Mourgram, Sealmyd, and Yuiredd. Women might have names like Blaera, Courynna, Lynneth, Maera, Mourna, or Wydda.

"Simbul", one of the other titles of [[Alassra Silverhand]], the Witch-Queen of Aglarond, quite literally means "watchful warrior-wizard" in Aglarondan.<ref>
