'''Untheric''' was a regional language of the [[Old Empires]], and the official language of [[Unther]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

==Speakers==
Untheric was spoken from [[Mourktar]] in the north to the [[Council Hills]] in the south, and from the [[Winding River]] in the west to [[Azulduth]] in the east. as well as [[Aglarond]], Elves in the Chondalwood and the [[Yuirwood]] sometimes could speak Untheric.

==Script==
The original written form of Untheric employed a runic [[wikipedia:Syllabary|syllabary]], with a rune representing each possible syllable in the language, as opposed to its cousin [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]], which had a [[wikipedia:en:Logogram|logographic system]] with a symbol for each word.

==History==
Unlike the [[Mulhorandi language]], which changed very slowly over the centuries, Untheric evolved rapidly to become a very different language from its [[Rauric languages|Rauric]] roots, being strongly influenced by [[Imaskari languages|Imaskari]] slave argot.

The runes used to write Untheric seem to have been invented before the Untherites migrated from [[Raurin]]. They were postulated to have had an influence on the later alphabet of [[Thorass alphabet|Thorass]]. Because of the relationship between the gold dwarves of the Great Rift and the earliest settlers of Unther, many speakers of the language began to use the simpler dwarven alphabet instead of the larger syllabary.

==Related Languages==
Untheric was in the greater [[Untheric languages]] group{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}} within the [[Rauric languages]] family, being distantly related to the languages of [[Alzhedo|Calimshan]] and [[Midani language|Zakhara]]. Untheric had a strong influence on the development of the [[Chessentan language]].

==Examples==
Female Untheric given names included Chadra, Ilzza, Jezzara, Marune, Saldashune, Xuthra, and Zeldara. Male first names included Azzedar, Chadrezzan, Gibbur, Horat, Kassur, Numer, Samar, and Ungred. Surnames were rarely used; if there was ambiguity, a [[wikipedia:Patronymic|patronym]] would be employed.
