        "mainbody": "amaran was a regional language of Northeast Faer√ªn and the official language of the kingdom of Damara. Damaran was the major dialect of Chardic.\nThe language was spoken in many lands and by many peoples including Aglarond, Altumbel, the Anauroch, Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Dragon Coast, the Great Dale, the Galena Mountains, the Great Glacier, Guidodale, the Hordelands, Icelace Lake, Impiltur, the Moonsea, Narfell, Rashemen, the Ride, Sembia, among the Shadovar, Thay, Thesk, Vaasa, the Vast, and the Vilhon Reach. It was also sometimes spoken among dwarves, elves, goblins, half-elves, orcs, half-orcs, planetouched, taers, and volodni.\nIn Vaasa, a creole of Chardic was often spoken in addition to the Damaran dialect.\nSpeakers of the Damaran tongue used the Dethek alphabet of the dwarves. This practice developed from the relationship between the people of Impiltur and the dwarves of the Earthfast Mountains.\nDamaran was in the Ulou language group, the language group to which Netherese belonged. Damaran was also closely related to Easting, another Chard language which was spoken in the Vast and Impiltur in addition to Damaran.\nDamaran had been strongly influenced by Common and had a relationship to Aglarondan as well.\nCommon Damaran human surnames included Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, and Starag. Women and girls had names such as Alethra, Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, and Zora. Males bore names such as Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, and Sergor."
