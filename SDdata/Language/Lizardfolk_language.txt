The Lizardfolk language, also known as Lizard man or Lizardman, was the racial language of lizardfolk, or "lizard men" as they were otherwise referred to, on both Toril and across Wildspace.
Beyond lizardfolk themselves, the Lizardfolk tongue was a common secondary language among hurwaeti, lizard kings, and trens.
The Lizardfolk tongue was also somewhat common as a secondary language among warriors in Hlondeth and fairly common among most druids, including the jungle druids of the the Church of Ubtao. These specialty priests, who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived around the Chultan Peninsula, commonly knew both the base tongue and its ptera-man dialect.
This language consisted of various growling vowels and sharp consonants. Meaning was typically conveyed through tonal qualities, as well as simple sound.
