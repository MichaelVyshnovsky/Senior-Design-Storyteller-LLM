'''Node hieroglyphs''' were the writing system used by the [[spellweaver]] race.{{Cite dragon/338/Ecology of the Spell Weaver}} Far from a simple alphabet, hieroglyphs were closer to a complex cipher, the meaning of the symbols varying from one document to the other. Sages theorized that this was due to the alien way the spellweaver brain worked, encoding information in complex patterns incomprehensible to other creatures.

===Alphabet===
The spellweaver alphabet was made of at least 29 symbols.

===Numeric system===
Spellweavers used two different numeric systems.A senary number system, or "base-6" number system, only uses numbers from 0 to 5. Counting in base-6 looks like this: ''"0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, ..."''
They also developed a decimal numeral system to work with other races, such as the [[nerra]].
