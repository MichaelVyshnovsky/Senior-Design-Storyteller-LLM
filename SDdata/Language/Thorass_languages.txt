The Thorass languages composed a large linguistic grouping of languages spoken throughout Faerûn, including Thorass, Chondathan, and Common.
The Thorass language group was broken down by scholars into five subgroups
* Central Thorass languages
* North Thorass languages
* East Thorass languages
* Turmic
* Aglarondan
Thorass languages shared the same script, with only a few exceptions.
By the late 15 century DR, the Thorass group was the most active language group in Faerûn.
