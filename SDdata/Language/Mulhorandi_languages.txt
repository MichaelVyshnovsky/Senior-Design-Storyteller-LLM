The '''Mulhorandi languages''' were a sub-grouping of the [[Mulani languages]]<ref name=D:SiT-p29>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}} and members of the [[Rauric languages]] family.<ref name=D:SiT-p29 />

==Languages==
This sub-grouping included the tightly related languages [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]] and [[Thayan language|Thayan]].<ref name=D:SiT-p29 /> Some scholars did not recognize these two languages as distinct and only recognized a single Mulhorandi language.

==Grammar==
The Mulhorandi languages were highly inflected, and word order was of only minor importance. The languages sounded thick and slow to speakers of many other languages.

==Scripts==
In their earliest forms, the Mulhorandi languages used a [[wikipedia:en:Logogram|logographic system]] of writing, which included pictographs to represent concepts. Over the millennia, the written form of the languages were simplified yet still contained tens of thousands of pictographs. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], speakers of Mulhorandi proper tended to use the [[Celestial alphabet]] instead, which was taught to them by the god [[Thoth]], while those speaking Thayan utilized [[Infernal alphabet|Infernal]] in their writing.

==History==
It has been theorized that priestly rituals played a strong role in the sound and cadence of these languages.
