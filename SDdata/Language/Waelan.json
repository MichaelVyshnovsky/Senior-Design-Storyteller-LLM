        "mainbody": "aelan was the native language of the Ffolk.\nWaelan was spoken by the Ffolk of the southern Moonshaes, although by 1372 DR the majority of Ffolk in the Isles spoke the Illuskan language of the Northlanders who had invaded their native home.\nThe Ffolk who had migrated to the Five Kingdoms of the Utter East also spoke Waelan.\nThere were two major dialects of Waelan, Proper (spoken in the Moonshaes) and Five Kingdoms (spoken in the Utter East). The two dialects were substantially different from each other as a result of their separation. Five Kingdoms Waelan was comparatively isolated by the Utter Easts mountainous borders, yet also influenced by the Northmen settlers whod accompanied the Ffolk and by corsairs and merchants from across south Faer√ªn and north Zakhara.\nThe term \"Waelan\" also referred to the group of languages including Waelan and Cosh, a little-known tongue spoken in the Nelanther Isles.\nThe two secret druidic languages, Drueidan and Daelic, were derived from Waelan.\nSome scholars believed that the ancient Talfir race spoke Waelan, which was itself derived from the Draconic language.\nWaelan and Cosh used the Thorass alphabet the druidic languages had their own secret script."
