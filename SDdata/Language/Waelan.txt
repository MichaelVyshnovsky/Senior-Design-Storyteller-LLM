'''Waelan''' was the native language of the [[Ffolk]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

==Speakers==
Waelan was spoken by the [[Ffolk]] of the southern [[Moonshae Isles|Moonshaes]],<ref name=D:SiT-p26/> although by [[1372 DR]] the majority of Ffolk in the Isles spoke the [[Illuskan language]] of the [[Northlander]]s who had invaded their native home.<ref name=RoF-p106>

The Ffolk who had migrated to the [[Five Kingdoms]] of the [[Utter East]] also spoke Waelan.<ref name=D:SiT-p26/>

==Dialects==
There were two major dialects of Waelan, Proper (spoken in the Moonshaes) and Five Kingdoms (spoken in the Utter East).<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}} The two dialects were substantially different from each other as a result of their separation. Five Kingdoms Waelan was comparatively isolated by the Utter East's mountainous borders, yet also influenced by the [[Northmen]] settlers who'd accompanied the Ffolk and by [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] and merchants from across [[south Faerûn]] and [[north Zakhara]].<ref name=D:SiT-p29>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Related Languages==
The term "Waelan" also referred to the group of languages including Waelan and [[Cosh]], a little-known tongue spoken in the [[Nelanther Isles]].<ref name=D:SiT-p28/>

The two secret [[druid]]ic languages, [[Druidic language|Drueidan]] and [[Druidic language|Daelic]], were derived from Waelan.<ref name=D:SiT-p28/>

Some scholars believed that the ancient [[Talfir]] race spoke Waelan, which was itself derived from the [[Draconic language]].

==Script==
Waelan and Cosh used the [[Thorass alphabet]]; the druidic languages had their own secret script.<ref name=PH-p35>
