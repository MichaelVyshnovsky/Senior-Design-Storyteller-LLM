Its alternative name stemmed from a belief that it had first originated among annis hags before becoming widely adopted by the other hag subraces.\nAnnis Hag The dialect spoken by annis hags.\nGreen Hag The dialect spoken by green hags. Some believed it derived from the dialect spoken by annis hags,\nNight Hag The dialect spoken by night hags and as a secondary language among some planewalkers.\nSea hag The dialect spoken by sea hags.\nGrahachi\n\"screams\"\nSome scholars believed that hags were descended from ogres, or at the very least that annis hags and ogre mages were somehow related.
