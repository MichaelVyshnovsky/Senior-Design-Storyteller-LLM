        "mainbody": "he Yeti language was the racial language of yetis.\nBeyond yetis themselves, this language was a common secondary language among the arctic dwarves, who lived within the distance of many yetis in the Great Glacier, and more rarely was known among people living in the Icewind Dale region.\nBeyond just being a verbal language, Yeti exhibited a sort of runic system that was used to mark trailside features, such as routes, whether water was safe to drink, or if an area held the risk of a rockslide occurring. They were also used to mark territories or to negotiate with other yetis, the latter of which would be answered by marking a rune beside the original and then in turn responded back to by the original mark-maker by scratching another rune below those two.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the frost giants of Svardborg stumbled upon a tribe of Northlanders were living on ice floes in the Sea of Moving Ice that spoke the Yeti language. The frost giants conquered the tribe, then brought then back to Svardborg, relying upon them to command a force of yetis.\n* Avarice, a tiefling member of the Arcane Brotherhood.\n* Bjornhild Solvigsdottir, queen of the Reghedmen Tribe of the Tiger during the late 15 century DR."
