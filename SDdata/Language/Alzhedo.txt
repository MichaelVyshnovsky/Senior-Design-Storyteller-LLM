'''Calishite Alzhedo''' was a regional tongue of [[Southwest Faerûn]], and the main language of [[Calimshan]]. Other regions where it was commonly spoken included: [[Amn]], [[Chult]], the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]], [[Lapaliiya]], [[Lantan]], the [[Nelanther Isles]], the [[Shaar]], [[Tashalar]], [[Tethyr]], [[Waterdeep]] (among [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[elf|elves]], and [[gnome]]s), the [[Western Heartlands]] (among [[halfling]]s and [[planetouched]]), the [[Wealdath]], [[Tharsult]], and the [[Old Shanatar]] region of the [[Underdark]].{{cite book/Player's Guide to Faerûn|11-31, Errata 1-2}}

Alzhedo, like most primarily [[human]] tongues, used the [[Thorass alphabet]].{{cite book/FRCS|85}}

Alzhedo was a derivative language of [[Untheric]] and was in the same language family as [[Midani]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues}}

Common Alzhedo surnames included Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, and Rein.{{cite book/FRCS|12}}

Calishite Alzhedo was very closely related to [[Auran|Old Alzhedo]], the language spoken on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], and this fact lends credence to the theory that the first civilizations in the Calimshan area were made up of travelers from that plane. Alzhedo was spoken at court, in all government and judicial proceedings, and throughout polite Calimshan society. It was a more guttural language than Old Alzhedo, and included many elements from [[Common]], [[Dwarvish]], and [[Elven language|Elvish]].<ref name=EotSS-p53> The majority of Calishites speak the High Calidrian dialect.
