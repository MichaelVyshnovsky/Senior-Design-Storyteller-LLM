        "mainbody": "'''Whalesong''' was the language spoken by all species of [[whale]]s, aquatic mammals that inhabited the oceans of [[Toril]] and whose high intelligence was often overlooked by surface dwellers.<ref>\n\nInstances of speech in this language were sometimes referred by other creatures as \"whale songs\" or \"whalesongs\".<ref> On other times, such instances of speech were given a prefix based on context, such as \"mournsongs\"<ref> or \"mourning songs\".<ref>",
        "Speakers": "Beyond whales themselves, Whalesong was commonly known in the oceans of [[Zakhara]] by the [[pahari]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/250/Heroes of the Sea|32}} It was also a common secondary language among [[sea druid]]s, a type of [[specialty priest]] in the [[Church of Deep Sashelas]].<ref>",
        "Phonology": "Whalesong consisted of a series of booming squeals, squeaks,<ref> buzzes, clicks, and whistles.\n\nMuch like the [[dolphin language]], Whalesong was a pure-sound language. This was in contrast to the many languages based around verbal speech that were employed by [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, and [[humanoid]]s. or even understand it&mdash;especially surface dwellers, who lacked the enhanced auditory and vocal capabilities of [[dolphin]]s and whales necessary for such higher sounds. Some referred to it as being part of the background noise of the ocean depths, the \"[[Hum of the Deep]]\".",
        "History": "When the [[mythal]] of the underwater city of [[Myth Nantar]] was raised in {{YearlinkConvert|-2932|TS}}, the [[Dukar]]s added a noise-cancellation effect to block out the constant Hum of the Deep. However, their attunement of the mythal made an exception for whalesong, allowing it to penetrate the city's magical barrier.\n\nOnce every four years, on the same day that the [[Aryselmalyr Empire]] fell, the whales of Serôs sang a notably distinct whalesong. This leap day would later come to be marked in the [[Timesong calendar]] as \"Sashelsong\".\n\nFollowing the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], the tragic death of [[Nahaal|Nahaal the Great Whale]] during the conflict led the [[Sorlyn]] of Myth Nantar to establish a new tradition of undertaking [[pilgrimage]]s to the deeper depths of the [[Inner Sea]] so that they could sing alongside whale pods in memorial of the great [[bard]]. This tradition was readily embraced by the Sorlyn faithful throughout Serôs.",
        "Notable Speakers": "* [[Oel'yvia Reefglider]], a sea elven woman who worked as a barmaid at [[Bindle's Blade]], had an uncanny ability to sing in Whalesong and would occasionally entertain guests with her lyrical abilities.\n* [[Samalli]], a [[witch]] rumored to live on [[Thordentor]], was according to legend capable of sending out whale songs and that it was for this reason upwards of thirty whales annually beached themselves on the island.\n* Among the people of Serôs, whalesong was counted as part of the divine [[portfolio]] of [[Milil]], a [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] and Serôsian [[deity]] of music. A few of the whales in Serôs were even worshipers of Milil, singing their language for the Sorlyn clergy in Myth Nantar.\n* Many of the [[humpback whale]]s of Serôs were [[bard]]s in the [[Church of Oghma]], who recited their ancient legends to the Oghmanytes through whalesong. These Oghmanyte whale bards also possessed a unique ability to temporarily translate whalesong into [[Common]]."
