Celestial was the language of celestials. It used the Celestial alphabet.
It was brought to Toril through contact with good folk from other planes. It was described as beautiful, yet alien in nature, since it developed among beings with thought patterns very unlike those of humanity. Clerics often took the time to learn it, and the Celestial alphabet was used to transcribe the Mulhorandi language, except in Thay, where they wrote their own dialect of Mulhorandi using the Infernal alphabet instead.
