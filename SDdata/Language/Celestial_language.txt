'''Celestial''' was the language of [[celestial]]s. It used the [[Celestial alphabet]].

It was brought to [[Toril]] through contact with good folk from other [[planes]]. It was described as beautiful, yet alien in nature, since it developed among beings with thought patterns very unlike those of [[human]]ity. [[Cleric]]s often took the time to learn it, and the Celestial alphabet was used to transcribe the [[Mulhorandi language]], except in [[Thay]], where they wrote their own [[Thayan language|dialect of Mulhorandi]] using the [[Infernal language|Infernal]] alphabet instead.{{cite book/FRCS|85}}
