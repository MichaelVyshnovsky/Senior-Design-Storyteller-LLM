        "mainbody": "'''Midani''' was the common tongue of [[Zakhara]]. It was spoken by all \"enlightened\" citizens of that region as well as by most unenlightened savages of that land. A version of Midani, known as '''Uloushinn''' by some scholars, was also spoken by the [[Bedine]].",
        "Variants": {
            "Dead Tongues": "Related to Midani were several forgotten languages no longer spoken by any living cultures. They included [[Noga]] and [[Kadari]] (from the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]]). Other dead languages once spoken in the Zakhara region, such as [[Affa]], [[Drow dictionary|Drow Elven]], and [[Chun]], were apparently not related to Midani."
        },
        "Gendered Nouns": "Midani had gender-neutral terms for the holy warriors, outcast thieves, nomadic bards, and idol priests of Zakhara in the form of [[faris]], [[matrud]], [[rawun]], and [[kahin]], respectively. Though these terms were predominantly preferred among Midani speakers, there did exist less commonly used, feminine versions for each. These included '''farisa''', '''matruda''', '''rawuna''', and '''kahina'''.<ref>",
        "History": "Midani had roots in all four elemental tongues.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-339}}, nomads migrated through a [[portal]] from Zakhara to the [[Anauroch]] Desert, intermingling with a handful of [[Netherese]] survivors, eventually becoming the [[Bedine]]. The Bedine retained their ancestral Midani tongue, but lost all knowledge of the written version of that tongue. Centuries later, traders from surrounding lands introduced the Thorass alphabet to the Bedine, which they adapted."
