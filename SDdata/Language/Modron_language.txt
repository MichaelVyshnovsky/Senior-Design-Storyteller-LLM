Modron was the language spoken byÂ all forms of modrons.
The Modron language was quite complex and precise. To humanoids, it sounded like a series of "clicks and whirs".
Some planewalkers learned Modron as a secondary language, though it was considered to be more difficult to learn compared to some other planar languages.
There was no word in the Modron language for an individual to refer to itself in the single person. A modron always referred to itself as "we" or "us".
The Lawful Neutral tongue was believed to have derived from the Modron tongue.
