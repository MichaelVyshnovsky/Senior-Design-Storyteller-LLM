Khazari was the language spoken by the people of Khazari in Kara-Tur.
It was of the Shou Chiang languages group, being related to the Kao te Shou and Ra-Khati languages. The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.
