'''Khazari''' was the language spoken by the people of [[Khazari]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

It was of the [[Shou Chiang languages]] group, being related to the [[Kao te Shou]] and [[Ra-Khati language]]s. The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.
