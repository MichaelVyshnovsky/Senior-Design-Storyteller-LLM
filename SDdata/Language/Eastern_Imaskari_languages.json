        "mainbody": "The Eastern Imaskari languages was a collection of languages derived from Imaskari and spoken by the tribes of the eastern parts of the Hordelands.\nThe Eastern Imaskari languages were nasal languages and spoken in the back of the throat. Long i and e sounds were drawn out.\nChuchian, Gurri, Oigur, Quirish, and Zamogedi were commonly placed in this grouping. Fankiang and Khaghun, were distinct enough to sometimes be considered full languages of this group. Oigur and Quirish were also sometimes grouped with the Southern Imaskari languages. Gurri, the language of the Gurs, was so influenced by Halardrim as to be considered a creole and not a true language of the Eastern Imaskari group.\nAll of the tribes speaking these languages were located along the border of Shou Lung, north of the Kora Shan.\nWhile Gurri made use of the Thorass script, most of the other Eastern Imaskari languages did not have a written alphabet.\nAll of these tongues had a common ancestor in ancient Imaskari, or Roushoum, and were strongly influenced by the Shou Chiang languages."
