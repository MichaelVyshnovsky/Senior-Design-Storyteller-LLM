        "Description": "The Eastern Imaskari languages were nasal languages and spoken in the back of the throat. Long i and e sounds were drawn out.",
        "Languages": "[[Chuchian]], [[Gurri]], [[Oigur language|Oigur]], [[Quirish language|Quirish]], and [[Zamogedi language|Zamogedi]] were commonly placed in this grouping. Fankiang and Khaghun, were distinct enough to sometimes be considered full languages of this group. Oigur and Quirish were also sometimes grouped with the [[Southern Imaskari languages]]. Gurri, the language of the [[Gur]]s, was so influenced by [[Halardrim]] as to be considered a [[wikipedia:en:Creole language|creole]] and not a true language of the Eastern Imaskari group.\n\nAll of the tribes speaking these languages were located along the border of [[Shou Lung]], north of the [[Kora Shan]].",
        "Scripts": "While Gurri made use of the [[Thorass alphabet|Thorass]] script, most of the other Eastern Imaskari languages did not have a written alphabet.",
        "History": "All of these tongues had a common ancestor in ancient Imaskari, or [[Roushoum]], and were strongly influenced by the [[Shou Chiang languages]]."
