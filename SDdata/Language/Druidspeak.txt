The so-called '''Druidspeak''' was the secret language of the [[Emerald Enclave]].

==Description==
"Druidspeak" was a special language that resembled the structure of the [[thieves' cant]]. Those who spoke "druidspeak" dotted their normal speech with ecological references and more special words and phrases. The language was extremely difficult to learn without a tutor by those uninitiated. On average, it took an individual a year or more to master the secret language.

The language was only taught to the members of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and never to the outsiders.
