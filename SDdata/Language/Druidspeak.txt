The so-called Druidspeak was the secret language of the Emerald Enclave.
"Druidspeak" was a special language that resembled the structure of the thieves cant. Those who spoke "druidspeak" dotted their normal speech with ecological references and more special words and phrases. The language was extremely difficult to learn without a tutor by those uninitiated. On average, it took an individual a year or more to master the secret language.
The language was only taught to the members of the Emerald Enclave and never to the outsiders.
