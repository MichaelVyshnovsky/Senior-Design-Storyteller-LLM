__NOTOC__
Jhaamdathan was the language of the old Jhaamdathan Empire.
Jhaamdathan was also known as "Old Chondathan", and as this name suggests, it was the direct precursor of the Chondathan language. The original "Common" tongue, Thorass ("Old Common"), came about as a mixture of Jhaamdathan and Alzhedo, and thus, Jhaamdathan was a progenitor of modern Common as well.
Jhaamdathans progenitors included Jotun, the language of giants.
