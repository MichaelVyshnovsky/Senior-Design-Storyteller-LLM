'''Thorass''', or '''Old (Auld) Common''' and the direct ancestor of [[Common]].

==Description==
Thorass was similar enough to modern Common that it could be directly translated into the latter language, though it would have a jarring form and archaic vocabulary. It had a base 10 numbering system.

==Speakers==
Thorass was spoken by the people native to the world of [[Abeir]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-09-16/Abeiran languages}}

By the second half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], few were literate in Thorass, with some exceptions in the southern parts of Faer没n.

Because the [[Shadovar]] who returned to [[Toril]] in [[1372 DR]] were from an earlier time, some of them still spoke Thorass as a second language.

==Script==
An unknown scribe eventually developed a [[Thorass alphabet|written alphabet]] for Thorass. While the language had almost fully died out from common use by the end of the 14{{th}} century, the alphabet survived and was used in languages such as Common, [[Chessentan language|Chessentan]], [[Rashemi language|Rashemi]], and [[Uluik language|Uluik]].

==History==
Thorass was thousands of years older than Common, having come about because of trade along the [[Lake of Steam]] from the early [[Calishite]]s and [[Jhaamdath]]ans. It was thus derived from the ancient [[Jhaamdathan language|language of Jhaamdathan]] mixed with [[Alzhedo]]. There was also a great deal of evidence that Thorass was derived in part from older incarnations of [[Jotun]], the language of [[giant]]s.

It was classified as belonging to the [[Central Thorass languages|Central Thorass]] subgroup of the [[Thorass languages|Thorass]] group of [[Faer没nian languages]].
