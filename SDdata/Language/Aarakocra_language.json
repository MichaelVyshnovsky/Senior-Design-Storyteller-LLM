Beyond the native aarakocra themselves, it was a common secondary language among elves of the Elven Imperial Fleet.\nMalatran Aarakocra A dialect spoken by the aarakocra of the Malatran Plateau.\nThe Aarakocra tongue included a word for \"gargoyle\", one of their sworn foes, that loosely translated to \"flying rock\".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text.\nAaarakocran names typically featured two to four syllables. Clicks, trills, or whistles acted as the connectors between these syllables.\nEither Gender Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, and Zeed."
