        "mainbody": "The '''Beholder language''' was the language spoken by the [[beholder|many-eyed monster]]s of the same name, as well as [[Beholder#Beholderkin|beholderkin]]. The beholders of [[Faerun]] knew their own language as '''Quevquel''' or '''\"Speech\"''', distinguishing it from telepathic communication.",
        "Speakers": "Beyond beholders and beholderkin, this was a common secondary language among some spacefaring races, such as the [[aartuk]] and [[space mimic]]s.\n\nBeholder was also somewhat common as a secondary language among some [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms, more specifically those who tended towards learning the tongues of monstrous creatures. These included the [[dreadmaster]]s of the [[Church of Bane]] and the [[noroghor]] of [[Abbathor]].",
        "Phonology": "The beholder language was difficult for most humanoids to understand and speak, but not impossible. It was a guttural tongue with much lip-smacking, gurgling, and slobbering. A long conversation between two beholders (assuming they didn't immediately try to kill each other) quickly covered their surroundings with spit.",

Quevquel was the swifter and simpler version of an elder, Faer√ªnian beholder language, the largely forgotten \"[[Uibilaqthraxx]]\" or the \"True Tongue\".\n\nFor example, the word \"sarruin\" in Quevquel, referred to tiny beholderkin (such as [[gazer]]s), and could be translated to mean \"little-kin\". This word was either descended or borrowed from the Uibilaqthraxx word \"lurl'uk'lok'lahassarruin\".{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/01-28 - Miscellaneous Q&A}}",
