The Vistani language, which was properly called the patterna, was the common language spoken by most Vistani. It was a creole language, being a mixture of words from Common, several humanoid languages, and unique slang. It was considered rather complex, owing to it being conveyed by context and intonation rather than by straight definitions or root words. It was also composed of many concepts, phrases, and words that had no direct translations into Common or other tongues. And many ordinary words in Common had no direct translations into patterna. Because of all this, there existed no comprehensive books on Vistani vocabulary or translation.

In the , a group of adventurers in the city of Ravens Bluff were informed by a local Vistani by the name of Madam Coth to go to the aid of High Priestess Morlain of the Palace of Passion, having foreseen in a nightmare that danger was coming for her. This quest took them beyond the city to a Sunite spa resort known as the Valley of Dolls, but on the way there they were waylaid by a trap set by a rival priestess, the Talontar Ivy Creeper. She set a trap for them in the form of six black disks, each inscribed with writing that helped to focus them into summoning spots for a variety of baatezu. These inscriptions were all written in the Vistani language.
