It was of the [[Shou Chiang languages]] group.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}<ref group=\"note\">The T'u Lung language is not mentioned as among the Shou Chiang languages in ''[[The Horde]]'', but it may be assumed to be as ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' and other sources establish it to be closely related to the language of Shou Lung.\n\nIt came from the same root tongue as [[Kao te Shou]], the language of [[Shou Lung]]. The grammar remained the same, but the dialects varied much more dramatically, as the feudal boundaries of T'u Lung were much more rigid. The regional variations and accents could make it sometimes difficult to understand."
