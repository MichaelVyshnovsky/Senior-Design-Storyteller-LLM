Oigur was a language spoken in the Hordelands.
Oigur was a nasal language. Vowels pronounced close and toward the front of the mouth were drawn out. It also had harsh consonant sounds, especially its Ks, and the sound of L was aspirated. Its grammar had a subject&ndashobject&ndashverb order.
Oigur was spoken primarily by the nomadic Oigur tribe.
Oigur did not have a written script.
Scholars classified Oigur as one of both the Southern and the Eastern Imaskari languages. It was strongly influenced by the Shou Chiang languages of Shou Lung and the tongue of Muhjuri.
