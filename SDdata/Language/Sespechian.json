Hlondethan creole was a mixture of Proper Sespechian with the [[Yuan-ti language|language]] of the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Hlondeth]], Western creole was mixed with the [[Lizardfolk language|tongue]] of the [[lizardfolk]] of [[Surkh]], and Plains Sespechian was strongly influenced by the [[wemic]]s of the Shining Plains. All of these dialects were distinct enough to make intercommunication difficult, because of both accent and vocabulary.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}",
