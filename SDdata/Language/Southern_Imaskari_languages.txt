The Southern Imaskari languages were a group derived from Imaskari and spoken by the tribes of the southern parts of the Hordelands.
The Southern Imaskari languages had hard, almost biting, consonants. The sound of l was strongly aspirated. The grammar followed a subject-object-verb word order.
Most of the tribes speaking these languages were found in the central regions of the Endless Waste, south of the Kora Shan.
This grouping included Dalat and Tuigan. Naican was sometimes placed in this grouping or sometimes with the Northern Imaskari languages. Oigur and Quirish shared classification here and with the Eastern Imaskari languages.
These languages shared most in common with ancient Imaskari but also had a strong Muhjuri influence.
