'''Jannti''', was the shared native language of all [[genie]]kind, including the [[djinn]], [[efreet]], [[marid]]s, [[dao]], and [[jann]].

==Speakers==
Beyond genies themselves, the various genie tongues were common as secondary languages among many [[planewalker]]s.<ref>

==Related Languages==
Jannti was one of the roots of the [[Midani language]], the common tongue of [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Derivatives==
While Jannti was effectively a single language, it had long been a matter of some debate among sages on the [[Prime Material]] as to whether or not the distinct tongues of each type of genie were separate elemental languages or merely dialects of Jannti.

;Dao: The dialect of the dao and [[noble dao]]. It was characterized as low-pitched and rumbling. Unlike the other dialects, Dao involved trilling vowels and the grinding of consonants.
;Djinni: The dialect of the djinn and [[noble djinn]]. It was characterized as sibilant and melodious, reminiscent of a breeze.
;Efreeti: The dialect of the efreet, [[noble efreeti|noble efreet]], and [[oathbinder genie]]s.<ref> It was characterzed as harsh and quite passionate. Unlike the other dialects it was spoken in a clipped, precise rhythm, and tended to over-stress syllables.
;Marid: The dialect of the marids and [[noble marid]]s. It was characterized as having an imperious tone.
