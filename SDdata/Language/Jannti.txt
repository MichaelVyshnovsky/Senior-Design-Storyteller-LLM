Jannti, was the shared native language of all geniekind, including the djinn, efreet, marids, dao, and jann.
Beyond genies themselves, the various genie tongues were common as secondary languages among many planewalkers.
Jannti was one of the roots of the Midani language, the common tongue of Zakhara.
While Jannti was effectively a single language, it had long been a matter of some debate among sages on the Prime Material as to whether or not the distinct tongues of each type of genie were separate elemental languages or merely dialects of Jannti.
Dao The dialect of the dao and noble dao. It was characterized as low-pitched and rumbling. Unlike the other dialects, Dao involved trilling vowels and the grinding of consonants.
Djinni The dialect of the djinn and noble djinn. It was characterized as sibilant and melodious, reminiscent of a breeze.
Efreeti The dialect of the efreet, noble efreet, and oathbinder genies. It was characterzed as harsh and quite passionate. Unlike the other dialects it was spoken in a clipped, precise rhythm, and tended to over-stress syllables.
Marid The dialect of the marids and noble marids. It was characterized as having an imperious tone.
