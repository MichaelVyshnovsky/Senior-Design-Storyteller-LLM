Arabic
Midani was the common tongue of Zakhara. It was spoken by all "enlightened" citizens of that region as well as by most unenlightened savages of that land. A version of Midani, known as Uloushinn by some scholars, was also spoken by the Bedine.
Zakhara had five regional dialects. which was known as the "Golden" dialect.
The Bedine spoke a dialect of Midani.
Thieves Cant was a choppy Midani lingo spoken only by rogues. It varied slightly from city to city.
Maran was a related language. 
Related to Midani were several forgotten languages no longer spoken by any living cultures. They included Noga and Kadari (from the Ruined Kingdoms). Other dead languages once spoken in the Zakhara region, such as Affa, Drow Elven, and Chun, were apparently not related to Midani.
Midani had gender-neutral terms for the holy warriors, outcast thieves, nomadic bards, and idol priests of Zakhara in the form of faris, matrud, rawun, and kahin, respectively. Though these terms were predominantly preferred among Midani speakers, there did exist less commonly used, feminine versions for each. These included farisa, matruda, rawuna, and kahina.
Midani had roots in all four elemental tongues.
In , nomads migrated through a portal from Zakhara to the Anauroch Desert, intermingling with a handful of Netherese survivors, eventually becoming the Bedine. The Bedine retained their ancestral Midani tongue, but lost all knowledge of the written version of that tongue. Centuries later, traders from surrounding lands introduced the Thorass alphabet to the Bedine, which they adapted.
