Elven (commonly called Elvish and sometimes referred to as the True Tongue) was the language (or language family) of the TelQuessir (e.g., eladrin, elves, and drow). Its script was known as Espruar.
 Grodd A dialect spoken exclusively by grodd goblins. This dialect was a corrupted form of Ancient Elvish, derived from an extensive period of servitude to the elven wizard Nalavarauthatoryl. This dialect was roughly 50% comprehensible to those fluent in contemporary Elvish, allowing for the general gist of meanings to be conveyed.
 Sea Elvish The dialect spoken by sea elves.
 Wild Elvish  This dialect, spoken by sylvan elves, was highly musical. It sounded strange to other elves, but could be understood by them with some difficulty.
