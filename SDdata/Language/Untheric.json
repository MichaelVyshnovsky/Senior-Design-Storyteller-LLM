They were postulated to have had an influence on the later alphabet of Thorass. Because of the relationship between the gold dwarves of the Great Rift and the earliest settlers of Unther, many speakers of the language began to use the simpler dwarven alphabet instead of the larger syllabary.\nUntheric was in the greater Untheric languages group within the Rauric languages family, being distantly related to the languages of Calimshan and Zakhara. Untheric had a strong influence on the development of the Chessentan language.\nFemale Untheric given names included Chadra, Ilzza, Jezzara, Marune, Saldashune, Xuthra, and Zeldara. Male first names included Azzedar, Chadrezzan, Gibbur, Horat, Kassur, Numer, Samar, and Ungred. Surnames were rarely used if there was ambiguity, a patronym would be employed."
