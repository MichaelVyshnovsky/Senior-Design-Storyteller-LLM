        "mainbody": "'''Wa-an''', or the '''Wa language''', was a language spoken by the [[Wanese]], inhabitants of [[Wa]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}\n\nWa-an descended from the ancient [[Han language]], as did [[Koryo language|Koryo]] and [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran]], and possibly others.\n\nWa-an was abundant with polite expressions and flowery terminology. Etiquette rather than grammar regulated the proper usage of many phrases.",
        "Derivation": "Wa-an was divided up into a number of dialects for each of the Wanese social classes, each with vocabulary most often employed by folk of that class and not necessarily used by others. For example, the farmers and fishermen of the No class spoke No Wa-an, which featured a great deal of agricultural terminology that was not to be found in, say, Lords Wa-an.<ref group=\"note\">Only the No Wa-an dialect has been named in the sources. The names of the other dialects were estimated based on the name \"No Wa-an\" and the names of the social classes given in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'', Volume II.",
        "History": "According to legends, the written form of the language was created by Wa's first emperor, [[Kochi]], the Master of the Peace Tree. In the first year of his reign, the first ever [[ch'i-lin]] rose from the waters of the [[Akano River]] and presented itself to Kochi. Upon the ch'i-lin's back were a series of characters, from which Kochi created the earliest written forms of Wa-an."
