The Treant language, also referred to as Treantish, was the racial language of treants.
Beyond treants themselves, Treantish was a common secondary language among a great variety of creatures with connections to the woodlands. These included hamadryads, forest gnomes, kercpas, moon elves, sun elves, voadkyn, and volodni.
Treantish was also fairly common as a secondary language among most forest-based druids, including those who devoted themselves to certain nature deities. the druids of Eldath, the druids and druid/rangers of Mielikki, the druids of Silvanus, the druids of Sheela Peryroyl, and the druids of Shiallia. Other forms of specialty priests in the Realms for whom Treantish was a commonly known secondary language included the Eldathyn peacemen and the Shiallian woodwives.
