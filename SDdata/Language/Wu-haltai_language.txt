Wu-haltai was a language spoken by the Wu-haltai people of the Ama Basin. It was one of the chief languages of the region.Only the Issacortae and Pazruki languages are specified as part of the Amaese languages group. It is assumed that the language of the Wu-haltai people, also indigenous to the Ama Basin and sharing cultural similarities with the Issacortae and Pazruki, is also a part of the Amaese languages group.
Wu-haltai was related to Issacortae and Pazruki, other languages in the Amaese languages group.
As with the other Amaese languages, Wu-haltai was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.
The Wu-haltai tongue had many points in common with the language of the ogre magi, presumably acquired from the ogre tribes of the region.
It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Wu-haltai nation had no writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations.
