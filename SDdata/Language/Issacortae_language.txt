'''Issacortae''', also spelled '''Isacorte''', was a language spoken by the [[Issacortae]] people of the northwestern [[Ama Basin]]. It was one of the chief languages of the region.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

Issacortae was related to [[Pazruki language|Pazruki]] and [[Wu-haltai language|Wu-haltai]], other languages in the [[Amaese languages]] group. Issacortae was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the [[Eastern Imaskari languages]] group.

It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Issacortae nation had little writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations.
