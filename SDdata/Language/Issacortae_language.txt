Issacortae, also spelled Isacorte, was a language spoken by the Issacortae people of the northwestern Ama Basin. It was one of the chief languages of the region.
Issacortae was related to Pazruki and Wu-haltai, other languages in the Amaese languages group. Issacortae was considered to be "only vaguely related" to the Eastern Imaskari languages group.
It comprised a family of dialects descending from a common ancestral tongue. The Issacortae nation had little writing or centralization, so the language developed independently of the other nations.
