The '''Beholder language''' was the language spoken by the [[beholder|many-eyed monster]]s of the same name, as well as [[Beholder#Beholderkin|beholderkin]]. The beholders of [[Faerun]] knew their own language as '''Quevquel''' or '''"Speech"''', distinguishing it from telepathic communication.

==Speakers==
Beyond beholders and beholderkin, this was a common secondary language among some spacefaring races, such as the [[aartuk]] and [[space mimic]]s.

Beholder was also somewhat common as a secondary language among some [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms, more specifically those who tended towards learning the tongues of monstrous creatures. These included the [[dreadmaster]]s of the [[Church of Bane]] and the [[noroghor]] of [[Abbathor]].

==Phonology==
The beholder language was difficult for most humanoids to understand and speak, but not impossible. It was a guttural tongue with much lip-smacking, gurgling, and slobbering. A long conversation between two beholders (assuming they didn't immediately try to kill each other) quickly covered their surroundings with spit.

==Beholder names==
Beholders normally named themselves within the first year of their lives, Their names were long and complicated, and pronouncing them produced much saliva. Beholders that could allow themselves to dwell in humanoid settlements, establishing themselves as the unseen leaders for guilds of lesser beings, adopted more easily pronounceable names in their minions' language.

==Grammar==
The beholder language had no word for the name of their species and the eye tyrants didn't even recognize the term "beholder" as anything more than the assigned label of inferior creatures. In the rare situations where a beholder befriended another, they normally called the other by its own name, perhaps the greatest form of respect they could show.

===Suffix===
The suffix -hurr or -urr indicated an illness. The suffix -rakk or -akk indicated a temporary condition, and could apply to something such as the weather.

==History==
Beholders had possessed many different languages over the long ages of their existence,{{Cite dragon/418/Eye on the Realms: The High Priest of Beholders}} although within minutes of being born, most could speak the beholder language. Quevquel was the swifter and simpler version of an elder, Faer√ªnian beholder language, the largely forgotten "[[Uibilaqthraxx]]" or the "True Tongue".

For example, the word "sarruin" in Quevquel, referred to tiny beholderkin (such as [[gazer]]s), and could be translated to mean "little-kin". This word was either descended or borrowed from the Uibilaqthraxx word "lurl'uk'lok'lahassarruin".{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/01-28 - Miscellaneous Q&A}}
