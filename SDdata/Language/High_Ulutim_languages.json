        "mainbody": "The descriptive term \"High Ulutim\" referred to two closely related Ulou languages spoken in the northernmost (\"high\") reaches of Faer√ªn by the Ulutiun people.\nThe High Ulutim languages were Uluik and Ulutiun. Both languages were very closely related, and some scholars did not recognize Ulutiun as a language in its own right, calling both High Ulutim languages \"Uluik\". The Ulutiun people could similarly be split into two distinct cultural groups&mdashthose living on the Sea of Moving Ice were called the \"Ice Hunters\" and spoke Uluik those living on the Great Glacier were the \"Ulutiun\" and spoke Ulutiun.\nBy 1372 DR Uluik and Ulutiun had only recently begun using the Thorass script, if writing was used at all."
