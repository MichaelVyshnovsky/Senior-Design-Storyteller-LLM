''Lords of Madness'' does reflect the design decision from 3{{rd}} edition onward of not giving the neogi their own language, however, pruning of racial languages was widespread post-2{{nd}} edition, therefore this cannot be taken as a sign that their language is in fact extinct within Realms canon.",
        "Speakers": "The Neogi language was a common secondary language among [[aartuk]], [[space mimic]]s, and [[elves]] of the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]]. In terms of geographical reach, Neogi was common among inhabitants of [[Realmspace]] and in much of the [[Astromundi Cluster]]. In the Cluster this language was so widespread as to have nearly as many speakers as Common.\n\nIt was generally discouraged for non-native speakers to attempt saying the names of the Neogi [[deities]], for an incorrect pronunciation was considered among neogi to be an egregious offense warranting torture and death.",
        "Phonology": "[[Wikipedia:sibilant|Sibilants]] were quite prominent in K'azz'jak'n,<ref>{{Cite dragon/214/The Ecology of the Neogi|55}} with speakers of the language producing sounds reminiscent of whirring [[thri-kreen]] or the hissing of [[snake]]s. And the way in which words were structured and ordered in the language was considered by other creatures to be complex.\n\nBeing the language of a sexless race, K'azz'jak'n lacked gendered words. For example, instead of \"god\" or \"goddess\" the language only had an equivalent of \"deity\".",
