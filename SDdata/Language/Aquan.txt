'''Aquan''' was the language of the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

==Description==
Aquan was a flowing language full of subtleties of meaning. [[Aquatic elf|Aquatic elves]], [[hadozee]], [[merfolk]], [[triton]]s, [[water genasi]], and locathah all spoke Aquan.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, it was considered a dialect of [[Primordial language|Primordial]], so that creatures who spoke one of the other elemental dialects such as [[Auran]], [[Ignan]] or [[Terran]] could understand Aquan and vice-versa.
