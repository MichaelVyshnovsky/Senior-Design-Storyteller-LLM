The '''Vegepygmy language''' was the racial language of [[Vegepygmies]]. 

==Phonology==
As vegepygmies could not speak in the conventional sense, their language consisted largely of hissing, gestures, and rhythmic body tapping.

==Notable Speakers==
* There was at least one non-vegepygmy speaker of the vegepygmy language: the [[weretiger]] [[Bwayes O'tamu]], who shared his dwelling with a tribe of vegepygmies in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
