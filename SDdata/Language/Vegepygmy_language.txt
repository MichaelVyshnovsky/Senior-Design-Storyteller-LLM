The Vegepygmy language was the racial language of Vegepygmies. 
As vegepygmies could not speak in the conventional sense, their language consisted largely of hissing, gestures, and rhythmic body tapping.
* There was at least one non-vegepygmy speaker of the vegepygmy language the weretiger Bwayes Otamu, who shared his dwelling with a tribe of vegepygmies in the late 15 century DR.
