The '''sahuagin language''' was the racial language of the [[sahuagin]].<ref><ref><ref>

==Speakers==
Beyond sahuagin themselves, this was a common secondary language was among [[sea elves]] of the [[Inner Sea]] and Outer Sea,<ref><ref><ref>{{Cite dragon/116/Children of the Deep|29}}  even though the two races were typically mortal enemies.

Some of the individual [[specialty priest]]s of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Sahuagin. These included the [[sea druid]]s of [[Deep Sashelas]], the [[waveservant]]s of [[Umberlee]], and the [[waterwalker]]s of [[Istishia]]. It was also a common secondary language among [[jungle druid]]s, specialty priests in the [[Church of Ubtao]], who sought to learn the exotic languages of the creatures that lived around the [[Chultan Peninsula]].<ref>

==Phonology==
The language of the sahuagins was difficult for most surface dwellers to understand without some [[magic]]al aid, as it involved a combination of body language and sounds made through the gills.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Dungeon of Sorrow|6}}

==Derivative Languages==
[[Serusan]], a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of [[Ser√¥s]], featured elements of the sahuagin language.
