'''Narfelli''' was the original language of the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] people of the ancient [[Narfell]]i Empire. It was strongly influenced by the [[Abyssal language]], as much of that empire's history was influenced by [[devil]]s and [[demon]]s.<ref name=RoF-p107>

By [[1372 DR]], Narfelli was a dead language, and the survivors of the Narfelli Empire, the Nars, spoke [[Damaran language|Damaran]]<ref name=RoF-p107/> and [[Naric]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} The language also had a strong influence on the modern [[Dambrathan language]].
