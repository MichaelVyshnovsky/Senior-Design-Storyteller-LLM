Raumvira was a language in the Imaskari languages group that was one of the predecessors to the Rashemi language of Rashemen.
Raumvira had round and broad vowel sounds. Its R sounds were rolled.
Raumvira was spoken by Raumvirans, the remnants of the Raumatharan Empire who resided in the Lake of Mists region.
Raumvira was written in the Dethek alphabet, which the Raumvirans learned from the Siremun dwarves long before even the founding of Raumathar.
Raumvira was strongly influenced by Dwarvish and the dialect of Imaskari (Roushoum) spoken in the northern parts of the Imaskari Empire.
