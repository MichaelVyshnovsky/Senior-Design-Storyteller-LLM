        "mainbody": "he Han languages were a group of languages spoken in Kara-Tur. No source has explicitly defined a \"Han languages\" linguistic group, though there is a group of languages descended from Han. This article follows the organization developed in the \"Speaking in Tongues\" article in Dragon Annual #4, used for other languages articles on this wiki.\nIt comprised a number of languages descended from the root Han language, including Koryo, Kozakuran, and Wa-an, and possibly others.\nKozakuran and Wa-an remained closely related some considered them only different dialects of the same language. There was perhaps 65% comprehension between the two.\nKoryos vocabulary comprised many words evolved from the old Han tongue, as well as loanwords from Wa-an and Kao te Shou that had been borrowed over centuries. Koryos vocabulary was very different to that of Kozakuran, but its grammar was very similar. Koryo sounded more like Wa-an than Kao te Shou, but it was as simple to use as Shou.\nThus most folk of Shou Lung, Wa, and even Kozakura found the Koryo language relatively easy to pick up, and most Koryoans in turn found Kao te Shou, Wa-an, and Kozakuran easy to learn as well."
