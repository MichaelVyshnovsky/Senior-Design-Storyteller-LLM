        "mainbody": "The '''Han languages''' were a group of languages spoken in [[Kara-Tur]]. <ref group=\"note\">No source has explicitly defined a \"Han languages\" linguistic group, though there is a group of languages descended from Han. This article follows the organization developed in the \"Speaking in Tongues\" article in ''[[Dragon Magazine Annual 1999|Dragon Annual #4]]'', used for other languages articles on this wiki.\n\nIt comprised a number of languages descended from the root [[Han language]], including [[Koryo language|Koryo]], [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran]], and [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]], and possibly others.\n\nKozakuran and Wa-an remained closely related; some considered them only different dialects of the same language. There was perhaps 65% comprehension between the two.\n\nKoryo's vocabulary comprised many words evolved from the old Han tongue, as well as loanwords from Wa-an and [[Kao te Shou]] that had been borrowed over centuries. Koryo's vocabulary was very different to that of Kozakuran, but its grammar was very similar. Koryo sounded more like Wa-an than Kao te Shou, but it was as simple to use as Shou.\n\nThus most folk of [[Shou Lung]], [[Wa]], and even [[Kozakura]] found the Koryo language relatively easy to pick up, and most Koryoans in turn found Kao te Shou, Wa-an, and Kozakuran easy to learn as well."
