The '''Shou Chiang languages''' were a group of languages spoken by the various nations of [[Kara-Tur]], namely [[Shou Lung]], [[T'u Lung]], [[Khazari]], and [[Ra-Khati]]. The Shou Chiang languages group comprised the [[Kao te Shou]], [[T'u Lung language|T'u Lung]], [[Khazari language|Khazari]], and [[Ra-Khati language|Ra-Khati]] languages.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}<ref group="note">The T'u Lung language is not mentioned as among the Shou Chiang languages in ''[[The Horde]]'', but it may be assumed to be as ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' and other sources establish it to be closely related to the language of Shou Lung. Of them, Kao te Shou and T'u Lung came from same root tongue.<ref group="note">This root language may be called "Shou Chiang", which is said in the ''The Horde'' to be the main language of Shou Lung, yet is used as the name of the group of languages that descend from it.

The languages were mutually intelligible, similar enough for a speaker of one to understand the other, yet different enough to count as separate languages.

The Shou Chiang languages heavily influenced the [[Eastern Imaskari languages]].

[[Shou Chiang]] was also the name of the written language of Shou Lung.
