        "Sound": "Lower-ranking demons spoke using sounds like the barking of canines, while the speech of more refined demons sounded like softly droning ocean waves mingled with the violence of a swarm of angry hornets. As with everything involving the [[tanar'ri]], however, their speech was unpredictable, and sometimes an elite [[balor|balor's]] words were rougher or a lowly [[bar-lgura|bar-lgura's]] words smoother.",
        "Script": "Abyssal used the [[Infernal language|Infernal language's]] script or the [[Barazhad]] alphabet."
