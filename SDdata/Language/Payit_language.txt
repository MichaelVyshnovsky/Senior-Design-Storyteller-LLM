Payit was the native language of the Payit and Itza, a human ethnic group and subgroup of East Maztica that lived in the nation of Payit and the Far Payit region.
Beyond the Payit themselves, the modern version of their native tongue was spoken by a few of the wild halflings of the Far Payit jungle.
A few creatures in Maztica spoke ancient forms of the Payit tongue. These included the plumazotl and the wild halflings. Most notably, the Tabaxi language was derived from an ancient form of Payit. Speakers of Modern Payit could comprehend roughly half of whatever was spoken in Tabaxi.
To modify most words into a plural form, one had to add the suffix "-ob". This was generally used when referring to a date. For example, when referring to the date of Cordells arrival to Maztica, the date would be given as "13 baktunob" or "5200 tunob".
The writing script of the Payit tongue was Maztican pictographs.
