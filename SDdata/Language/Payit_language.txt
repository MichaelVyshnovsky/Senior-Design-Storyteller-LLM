==Speakers==
Beyond the Payit themselves, the modern version of their native tongue was spoken by a few of the [[wild halfling]]s of the Far Payit jungle.<ref>

==Related Languages==
A few creatures in Maztica spoke ancient forms of the Payit tongue. These included the [[plumazotl]]<ref> and the wild halflings.
