''[[Races of Faerûn]]'', however, goes into some detail about the dead parent language of Illuskan, called Old Illuskan. Moreover, it is stated in ''Races of Faerûn'' that the Old Illuskans became the [[Reghedmen]], so it is reasonable to assume that Reghedjic derived from Old Illuskan as well. Thus, it is possible that Old Illuskan and Truskan are the same. In any case, Old Illuskan was certainly an Illuski language. It also influenced the modern language of [[Dambrathan language|Dambrathan]].",
        "Script": "Old Illuskan had its own alphabet. By [[1372 DR]], the only known samples of this script were located in the [[Green Library]] in [[Ruathym]] and in the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]].<ref name=RoF-p94/>"
