The '''Ogre language''',{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|29}} by [[Faerûn]]ian [[ogre]]s, [[Maztica]]n ogres, and [[Zakharan ogre]]s. The language was not spoken by the ogres of the [[Northern Wastes]] though, nor those found in most of [[Kara-Tur]], as they instead spoke the [[ogre mage language]].<ref>

==Speakers==
Beyond ogres themselves, Ogrish was commonly spoken as either a primary or secondary language among related races, such as [[half-ogre]]s, [[ogrillon]]s, [[ogre mage]]s, and [[sea ogre]]s.

Some [[specialty priest]]s in the Realms were known to learn Ogrish as a secondary language. These included the [[authlim]]s of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] and the [[dreadmaster]]s of the [[Church of Bane]]. In terms of regions, Ogrish was somewhat common as a secondary language among [[warrior]]s in [[Thar]].<ref>

==Derivatives==
;[[Hag language|Annis]]:
: Some believed that the language of [[hag]]s as a whole, referred to by many scholars as "Annis", was an offshoot of Ogrish.<ref>
;Merrow:
: Sea ogres possessed their own dialect of Ogrish that was similarly guttural.
;Zakharan:
: The Ogrish spoken by Zakharan ogres was far more robust than the base language spoken in Faerûn, having a far expanded vocabulary. Consequently, Faerûnian Ogrish was considered by Zakharan ogres to be primitive by comparison.

==Phonology==
Ogrish had some similarities to the [[Minotaur language]], to such an extent that proficiency in either tongue could allow one to quickly pick up the intricacies of someone speaking the other.{{Cite dragon/116/Ecology of the Minotaur|32-35}}

==Notable Speakers==
* [[Laurinda Brozik]], a [[human]] [[Thesk]]ian fortune teller at the [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]], counted Ogrish among her known secondary languages.
