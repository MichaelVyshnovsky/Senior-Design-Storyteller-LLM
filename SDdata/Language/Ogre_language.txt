The Ogre language, by Faerûnian ogres, Maztican ogres, and Zakharan ogres. The language was not spoken by the ogres of the Northern Wastes though, nor those found in most of Kara-Tur, as they instead spoke the ogre mage language.
Beyond ogres themselves, Ogrish was commonly spoken as either a primary or secondary language among related races, such as half-ogres, ogrillons, ogre mages, and sea ogres.
Some specialty priests in the Realms were known to learn Ogrish as a secondary language. These included the authlims of Iyachtu Xvim and the dreadmasters of the Church of Bane. In terms of regions, Ogrish was somewhat common as a secondary language among warriors in Thar.
Annis
 Some believed that the language of hags as a whole, referred to by many scholars as "Annis", was an offshoot of Ogrish.
Merrow
 Sea ogres possessed their own dialect of Ogrish that was similarly guttural.
Zakharan
 The Ogrish spoken by Zakharan ogres was far more robust than the base language spoken in Faerûn, having a far expanded vocabulary. Consequently, Faerûnian Ogrish was considered by Zakharan ogres to be primitive by comparison.
Ogrish had some similarities to the Minotaur language, to such an extent that proficiency in either tongue could allow one to quickly pick up the intricacies of someone speaking the other.
* Laurinda Brozik, a human Theskian fortune teller at the Jack Mooney & Sons Circus, counted Ogrish among her known secondary languages.
