Beyond elves, Dryadic was also commonly spoken by other [[fey]] creatures, such as [[satyr]]s<ref> (whom many sages speculated to be the male counterparts of dryads),

Dryadic was also fairly common as a secondary language among most [[druid]]s,<ref> including those devoted to certain nature deities.
