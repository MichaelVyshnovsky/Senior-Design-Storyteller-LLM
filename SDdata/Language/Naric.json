        "mainbody": "Naric was a language spoken by the Nars, from Icelace Lake in the north to Rawlinswood in the south, and from the Giantspire Mountains in the west to the Icerim Mountains in the east. It was one of the Low Ulutim languages. It was presumably derived from the ancient language of Narfelli.Narfelli is not mentioned in the \"Speaking in Tongues\" article of Dragon 1999 Annual, yet Naric is. It is possible that Naric and Narfelli are the same, yet Races of Faer√ªn makes it clear that Narfelli is a dead language, while the Dragon article indicates that Naric is still spoken, so it is assumed here that they are considered distinct languages.\nMost Nars also spoke Damaran."
