        "mainbody": "ymantheran  was a regional Draconic dialect spoken by the dragonborn of Tymanther. Tymantheran words sounded softer than normal Draconic, a little more nasal and with words that had elongated syllables.As seen in the novels of the Brimstone Angels series. There were words in Tymantheran that had no direct translation in the Common tongue.\nTymantheran dialect was based on the Aklave, the draconic dialect from Abeir, rather than from its Torilian variant.As, according to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide, Tymantheran dragonborn were native from Abeir until the Spellplague brought them to Toril.\nIt was considered by the dragonborn that they had \"stolen\" the language of the dragons during their years of slavery."
