The '''Untheric languages group''' was one of the two major branches of the [[Rauric languages]] family and included languages spoken in both [[Faerûn]] and [[Zakhara]].{{Cite dragon annual/1999/Speaking in Tongues|29}}

==Subgroups==
The Untheric languages included the [[Untheric]] language spoken in [[Unther]] and also those of two language subgroups, the [[Midani languages|Midani]] and [[Alzho languages]]. while the Midani and Alzho languages were shaped by the languages of [[genie]]s.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Untheric group had risen to become the third most active language group in [[Faerûn]].
