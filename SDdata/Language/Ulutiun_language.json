        "mainbody": "lutiun was a language spoken by the Ulutiun people of the Great Glacier.\nUlutiun was spoken by the easternmost branch of Ulutiuns who lived on the Great Glacier. The Ulutiuns known as \"Ice Hunters\", who lived on the Sea of Moving Ice, spoke Uluik, although some scholars did not differentiate between these two High Ulutim languages.\nThe three tribes of Ulutiuns&mdashthe Iulutiuns, the Angulutiuns, and the Nakulutiuns&mdashhad their own tribal dialects of Ulutiun, but these were mutually intelligible.\nUlutiun supposedly had about twelve different words for various kinds of snow and no words at all for sand.\nThe Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier had only been using the Thorass alphabet to write their language for a few centuries by 1372 DR.\nAs discussed above, Uluik was very closely related to the Ulutiun language. Both were distantly related to Damaran and Halruaan."
