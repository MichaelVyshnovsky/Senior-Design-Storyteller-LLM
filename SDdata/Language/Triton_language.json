        "mainbody": "The '''Triton language''' was the racial language of the [[triton]]s.",
        "Speakers": "Beyond tritons themselves, Triton was commonly a secondary language among [[asrai]], water sprites of the [[Upper Planes]].\n\nSome of the individual [[specialty priest]]s of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Triton. These included the [[sea druid]]s of [[Deep Sashelas]], the [[waveservant]]s of [[Umberlee]], and the [[waterwalker]]s of [[Istishia]].",
        "Grammar": "To modify a word to be a collective term, such as in order to refer to the members of a family or the various colonies surrounding the capital of one of their protectorates, tritons would add a \"(a)th\" to the interceding vowel where needed. For example, the [[Pumana Protectorate]] and [[Vuuvax Protectorate]] would be rendered as Pumanath and Vuuvaxath respectively.<ref> When used with a name, such as Numyn, depending upon the context it could refer to either possessions of the individual or their children.",

        },
        "Naming Conventions": "On average, a name in the Triton language had two to three syllables. Feminine names always ended in the letter \"n\", whilst masculine names always ended in the letter \"s\". Around the 9{{th}} century [[DR]], the customs of masculine names changed, with such names now taking on a vowel at their end.",
