        "mainbody": "he Triton language was the racial language of the tritons.\nBeyond tritons themselves, Triton was commonly a secondary language among asrai, water sprites of the Upper Planes.\nSome of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities were known to learn various other aquatic languages, such as Triton. These included the sea druids of Deep Sashelas, the waveservants of Umberlee, and the waterwalkers of Istishia.\nTo modify a word to be a collective term, such as in order to refer to the members of a family or the various colonies surrounding the capital of one of their protectorates, tritons would add a \"(a)th\" to the interceding vowel where needed. For example, the Pumana Protectorate and Vuuvax Protectorate would be rendered as Pumanath and Vuuvaxath respectively. When used with a name, such as Numyn, depending upon the context it could refer to either possessions of the individual or their children.\nkraknyth\n\"morkoth\". Translates literally as \"kin of the kraken\".\ntriton\n\"guardian\".\nOn average, a name in the Triton language had two to three syllables. Feminine names always ended in the letter \"n\", whilst masculine names always ended in the letter \"s\". Around the 9 century DR, the customs of masculine names changed, with such names now taking on a vowel at their end.\n* Veda Silas, a Ravenian half-elf wizard."
