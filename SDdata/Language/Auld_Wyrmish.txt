It was the precursor to the more widely spoken Aragrakh and the Draconic spoken in the Present Age.
Over time Auld Wyrmish developed and changed into having distinctly formal and casual (or "low") versions of the language. These versions were referred to by sages of other races as "Auld High Wyrmish" or "Old High Wyrmish" and "Wyrmish" respectively. The former was utilized in early draconic spells.
