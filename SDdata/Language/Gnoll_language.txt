The '''Gnoll language''', also referred to as '''Gnollish''', and [[flind]]s.

==Description==
The language was not a complete one, only able to communicate basic concepts. It consisted of cackling, howling, and whining sounds and often relied on gestures and facial expressions. Such words were mixed with a broken version of the [[Abyssal language]], allowing the leaders among them to communicate more complex thoughts.

==Speakers==
Beyond gnolls themselves, Gnoll was sometimes spoken as a second language by [[bugbear]]s, [[elves]] (of the [[Chondalwood]], the [[Forest of Lethyr]], and the [[High Forest]]), [[fey'ri]],<ref> [[forest gnome]]s,<ref> [[goblin]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[orc]]s, [[half-orc]]s,<ref> and [[zebranaur]]s.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/95/Four Legs Are Better Than Two|20}} Among elves it was typically learned by [[moon elves]] and [[wild elves]].<ref>

When it came to regions, Gnoll was somewhat common as a language in [[Anauroch]], [[Dambrath]], [[Lapaliiya]], and among [[warrior]]s in [[Thar]].<ref> [[Gnome]]s of the [[Great Dale]] and [[halfling]]s of [[Channath]], the Chondalwood, and [[Luiren]] also occasionally spoke it.

==Script==
Gnoll had no true script or written form, but some gnolls were shrewd enough to write in Abyssal.

==History==
Gnolls believed that their language was a gift to them from [[Yeenoghu]].{{Cite dragon/367/Playing Gnolls|50}}
