        "mainbody": "lluskan was an ethnic human language spoken in northwest Faerûn, largely by Illuskans.\nIlluskan was commonly used as a lingua franca along the Sword Coast North, in addition to the ubiquitous Common. Other regions where it was commonly spoken included Mintarn, the Moonshaes, Ruathym, and among the Uthgardt.\nThere were three major dialects of Illuskan. Moonshae was spoken by the Ffolk and the Northlanders of the Moonshae Isles. Ruathen was spoken in Ruathym, and True Luskan was the dialect of the city-state of Luskan. Bothii, the language of the Uthgardt, was treated by some as a dialect of Illuskan.\nLike the majority of Faerûns human tongues, Illuskan used the Thorass alphabet.\nIlluskan was in the Illuski language group, the same family language as Bothii and Reghedjic. It derived from Old Illuskan and was strongly influenced by Netherese.\nCommon Illuskan surnames included Brightwood, Helder, Hornraven, Lackman, Stonar, Stormwind, and Winddrivver. Common male names included Ander, Blath, Bran, Frath, Geth, Lander, Luth, Malcer, Stor, Taman, and Urth. Common female names were Amafrey, Betha, Cefrey, Kethra, Mara, Olga, Silifrey, and Westra.\nThe city of Neverwinter was originally called \"Eigersstor\", the Illuskan translation of the name.\n Dock-alfar  Dark elf\n Eigersstor  Neverwinter\n Hamfriggan  Lit. shapestrong, used to refer to the shapeshifters of Ruathym"
