Kuong was a language spoken by the Kuong people of the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra.
Coming from a different linguistic stock to the Laothan and Purang languages also spoken in Malatra, Kuong was distinctly unlike all other languages spoken in Kara-Tur. Because it was so unique, the Kuong people believed it to be specially blessed. However, most linguists observed that it was highly complex, followed no logic, and thought it weird. It was difficult to learn for even the most gifted minds.
