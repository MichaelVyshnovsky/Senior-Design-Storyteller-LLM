        "mainbody": "The Will-o-wisp language was an entirely optical language used by will-o-wisps, Nyths, and variants found in the Domains of Dread, such as will odeeps and will oseas.\nDescribed by some as merely a \"flickering light\" language, will-o-wisps and its other \"speakers\" conveyed ideas through changing the color and or the brightness or intensity of their light-based bodies.\nThe alien and subtle nature of this language made it largely incomprehensible to the average human, demihuman, and most other creatures. It was considered by many to be impossible to mimic, though some swamp-based druids managed to somewhat communicate in the language through the use of light sources, such as a hooded lantern."
