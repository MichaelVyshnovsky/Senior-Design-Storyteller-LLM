The '''Yeti language''' was the racial language of [[yeti]]s.<ref>{{Cite dragon/265/Primitive PCs|54}}

==Speakers==
Beyond yetis themselves, this language was a common secondary language among the [[arctic dwarves]], who lived within the distance of many yetis in the [[Great Glacier]],<ref><ref> and more rarely was known among people living in the [[Icewind Dale]] region.<ref>

==Description==
Beyond just being a verbal language, Yeti exhibited a sort of runic system that was used to mark trailside features,{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-01-27 - Yeti Trailmarks}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-01-27 - Blink Dog, Hook Horror, and Yeti Languages}} such as routes, whether water was safe to drink, or if an area held the risk of a rockslide occurring. They were also used to mark territories or to negotiate with other yetis, the latter of which would be answered by marking a rune beside the original and then in turn responded back to by the original mark-maker by scratching another rune below those two.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[frost giant]]s of [[Svardborg]] stumbled upon a tribe of [[Northlander]]s were living on ice floes in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] that spoke the Yeti language. The frost giants conquered the tribe, then brought then back to Svardborg, relying upon them to command a force of yetis.

==Notable Speakers==
* [[Avarice]], a [[tiefling]] member of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].
* [[Bjornhild Solvigsdottir]], queen of the [[Reghedmen]] [[Tribe of the Tiger]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR.
