The kuo-toa language, which was properly referred to as Kuo-toan, was the language spoken by kuo-toa.
Kuo-Toan was among the common racial languages of the Underdark. Thus it was not uncommon for there to be speakers among the demihumans of Faerûn that tended to live in the Underdark, such as drow, duergar, gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and svirfneblin. On the surface, it was a common secondary language among sea elves of the Inner Sea.
Some of the individual specialty priests of aquatic deities, who were known to learn the languages of various aquatic races, commonly knew Kuo-toan. These included the waveservants of Umberlee and the waterwalkers of Istishia.
Serusan, a pidgin language used by the various aquatic races of Serôs, featured elements of Kuo-toan.
