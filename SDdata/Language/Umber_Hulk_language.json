        "mainbody": "he Umber Hulk language, also known as Hulkish, was the racial language of umber hulks, a relatively intelligent subterannean race.\nUmber Hulk was a rather brutal language, conveying only limited information in a direct and concrete fashion. It was relatively easy for other creatures to learn and understand, but it was difficult to actually speak, as non-insectoids couldnt effectively reproduce the sounds made by umber hulks. Additionally, the language was often suplemented with various gestures, grunts, and hisses to add emphasis. Such gestures included movements of the mouth, mandibles, and eyes.\nVodyanoi The aquatic cousins of umber hulks, vodyanoi, spoke their own unique dialect of the language.\nThe Umber hulk tongue included a word for \"City Watch\".What exactly this word is was never stated within the cited text."
