        "mainbody": "aran or Mari was a language spoken by the Mar people of the Utter East. It was categorized in the Midani subgroup of the Untheric group of the Rauric languages family, and was most closely related to the languages of Zakhara. \nSounding strange yet melodious to Atreus Eleints ears, Maran was composed of many short syllables and employed throaty or guttural clicks. The Maran people often spoke it quite rapidly. The people of Langdarma spoke a dialect that was comparatively soft and delicate, and seemingly more ancient.\nThe phrase \"Ekckta reeto\" apparently meant \"She is telling the truth\" in Maran, but when Atreus tried it and could not manage the throat click, it came out as \"The yaks are very honest.\" However, since he had the deceitful Rishi Saubhari as a translator, it is hard to say for sure what either phrase truly meant.\nMar writers used the word \"parshan\" to refer to the foreigners (Ffolk) whod settled their lands in 621 DR.The word \"parshan\" may mean \"fighter\" or \"combatant\" in Persian, as mentioned [http//babynames.merschat.com/name-meaning.cgi?bn_key=78405 here] and [https//au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090114215741AA1T8KD here].\n\"Sahib\" was an honorific used in Maran."
