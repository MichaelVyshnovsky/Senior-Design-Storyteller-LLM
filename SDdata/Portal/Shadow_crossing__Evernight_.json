        "mainbody": "The '''shadow crossing''' in [[Neverdeath]] graveyard was a ''[[portal]]'' allowing for passage from [[Neverwinter]] in the [[Material Plane]] to [[Evernight]] in the [[Shadowfell]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was under the control of [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and her [[Thayan]] forces.",
        "Description": "The portal made use of [[circle magic]] A nearby ''[[teleportation circle]]'' granted easy access to the crossing for Valindra Shadowmantle and her apprentices.\n\nUnlike the many so-called [[Crevices of Dusk]] that connected Neverwinter and Evernight, this ''portal'' was not a naturally occurring gap in reality,",
        "Geography": "In Neverdeath, the crossing was located at the center of the graveyard in a section known as [[Craftsman's Rest]].\n\nIn Evernight, users of the crossing appeared between a pair of [[iron]] gates that otherwise appeared to lead nowhere. This site was located atop a small hill in a mostly abandoned neighborhood to the south. It lay within sight of the [[Thayan outpost (Evernight)|Thayan headquarters]].",
        "Defenses": "On the Evernight side of the crossing, hidden Thayan guards kept watch over the portal. These included [[undead]] who were loyal to Valindra rather than to the city's [[ghoul]] rulers.",
        "History": "As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, Valindra Shadowmantle and her Thayan forces were making use of the shadow crossing to prosecute their evil plans in Neverwinter, to establish a foothold in Evernight, and to secure access to the [[Shadowfell Road]]."
