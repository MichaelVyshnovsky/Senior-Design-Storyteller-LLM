        "mainbody": "revices of Dusk were portals, gateways, or otherwise \"gaps\" between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell that occurred throughout Neverwinter and its Shadowfell twin, Evernight.\nCrevices of Dusk were magical phenomena that connected a point in Neverwinter to the same point in Evernight, and vice versa. They could appear anywhere throughout Evernight but only appeared in places of darkness or shadow within Neverwinter. Under most circumstances, it was only possible to see or reach through a Crevice but not to travel through it. Even so, it was not unheard of for travelers to pass through one, whether intentionally, by accident, or after having been dragged through by a monster on the other side. Such Crevices were the primary source of food for the undead citizens of Evernight, namely by snatching away living citizens of Neverwinter.\nWhile it was said that there were countless Crevices throughout Neverwinter and Evernight, Such Crevices usually occurred within catacombs, tombs, coffins, abandoned buildings, back alleyways, unused cellars, or even dark corners of inhabited homes.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, Crevices of Dusk were not widely known or understood in Neverwinter, and were commonly sources of ghost stories and urban myths relating to hauntings and mysterious disappearances. Some of Neverwinters scholars (such as Eldon Keyward) were familiar with them and their nature, and were of course perturbed by their use. Within Evernight, indiscriminate use of the Crevices of Dusk was frowned upon, and stable Crevices were jealously guarded.\nIn the , Valindra Shadowmantle created a shadow crossing in Neverwinters Neverdeath Graveyard, which served as a more reliable means of travel from the Material Plane to the Shadowfell than the unpredictable Crevices of Dusk.\n* Evernights Corpse Market was well-known to be the site of many Crevices of Dusk, which were considered freely available for use by the hungry undead public.\n* The Dolindar Tomb had a stable Crevice connecting Evernights Graveyard to Neverwinters Neverdeath Graveyard.\n* A Crevice of Dusk located in Neverdeaths Paupers Field could be activated using a special coffer possessed by the lich Zarifrax."
