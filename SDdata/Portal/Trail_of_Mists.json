Nexus points could be found in or near the following places\n* Many locations throughout the High Forest\n* The Castle of Illusion\n* Myth Glaurach\n* The Citadel of the Mists\n* The ruins of Hellgate Keep\n* Dolblunde\n* Forharn\n* The Forgotten Forest\n* The Trollbark Forest\n* Stormpemhauder\n* Beldenshyn\n* The Trielta Hills\n* Hardbuckler\n* Tempuss Tears\n* Anga Vled\n* Skultan\n* The Friendly Arm\n* The taproom of the Thrashing Flail in Purskul\n* Elbencort\n* The Shinglefell Gnome Burrow, the location of which was lost.\n* Many cities in west Faerûn.\nThe Trail of Mists was a network of linked nexus points that allowed travel through the Border Ethereal from point to point. A given nexus point was connected to as little as one or as many as twelve other points. Nexus points were invisible and difficult to detect even by magical means. To step through a nexus point, a traveler would need to envelop it in a magical illusion and pass a part of their body through it while carrying a specific type of gemstone. Different nexus points were known to require different gemstones. Upon entering the Trail, a mistwalker could travel unimpeded by beings from the ethereal plane or obstructions on the material plane. Mistwalkers could cover many miles in an hour of travel along the Trail, and more intelligent creatures could travel at faster paces.\nThe Trail of Mists was founded around , when High Mages from the kingdom of Eaerlann helped gnome illusionists create a system of portals to allow safe passage of escaped gnome slaves from Netheril. A part of the abandoned elven fortress that would become the Citadel of the Mists was given to the gnomes to use as a waypoint in the Trail.\nAround , a demon that was bound in the Citadel of the Mists escaped, and the gnomes abandoned it as a stop on the Trail.\nThe famous gnome illusionist Fitzmilliyun Sparkledrim was one of many known to have extended the Trail.\nThe Keeper of the Vault of the Sages who annotated the gnome drinking song Ga Nomes as part of Mintipers Chapbook speculated that it had been written by Mintiper Moonsilver as thanks to gnomes who had helped him and his Moonlight Men travel through the High Forest by the Trail."
