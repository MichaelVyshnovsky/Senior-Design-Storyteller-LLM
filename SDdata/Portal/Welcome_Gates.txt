The Welcome Gates was a portal that provided a direct connection from the Lantan Embassy in Waterdeep to the Visitors Vale, a location situated just outside Anchoril on the southern island of Lantan.
The portal, at both entrances, measured  in height and  in width, and was encased in a metallic frame adorned with numerous intricate and buzzing mechanical devices.
Although it appeared to offer free and unrestricted passage, the reality of traveling through the Welcome Gates was intentionally complex and fraught with difficulties. Residents of Lantan and their families were granted the privilege to use the portals as per their need. To access this service, Lantanese residents were required to present a passport and proof of their residence.
Additionally, they could secure a gate pass for a nominal fee. Conversely, the procedure for non-Lantanese individuals to obtain a gate pass was considerably more complex and time-consuming. It encompassed a five-day process filled with extensive paperwork, necessitating daily visits to various official establishments throughout Waterdeep. Moreover, the process demanded the acquisition of signatures from three to six different city officials, with the exact number depending on the purpose of the visit as declared by the applicant.
The gate pass provided to visitors was designed as a whimsical, small wind-up toy, specifically a tin bird equipped with flapping wings. Portal wardens, interacting with the visitors, presented this toy as the essential key to activate the portal. However, in reality, the true key to the portal was the word "enjoy," pronounced in the Gnome language. This word was subtly incorporated into the conversation by the portal warden as the visitors stood at the threshold of the portal, poised to use their seemingly functional, yet actually symbolic, tin bird key. This clever ruse was part of the portals unique and intricate operation mechanism.
For nonresidents, the Welcome Gate operated exclusively during daylight hours, from dawn until dusk, with an exception the gate was closed between highsun and afternoon. The exact timing for these closures—when highsun ended and afternoon began—varied daily and was subject to the interpretation of the chief portal warden on duty that day. Additionally, according to the stipulations in the application handbook, visitors who were illiterate were categorically denied access to the gate. This policy was in place because Anchoril, the destination, was considered hazardous for those who were unable to read warning signs and other important notices.
The extensive paperwork and procedural hoops that visitors encountered at the Welcome Gate were largely superficial, serving as a facade for the true evaluative process employed by the portal wardens. This approach was characteristic of gnome practices, where the overt actions often masked the actual intent. Regardless of an applicants proficiency in completing forms and adhering to convoluted instructions, the wardens assessed applicants conduct and categorized them into one of three groups
* Keep Out This category was for individuals identified as known or potential troublemakers. The portal wardens possessed a plethora of tactics to indefinitely delay or obstruct the progress of such individuals through the application process.
* Tourist This designation was for applicants who appeared to pose minimal security risk and demonstrated genuine interest in visiting, evidenced by their partial progress through the application. These individuals either lacked the resources to navigate the entire application process or had a connection with someone deemed trustworthy by the wardens, who could vouch for them.
* Watch Carefully This category was reserved for those who navigated the bureaucratic maze with calm and determination. Such individuals, who persevered through all the required steps without showing signs of frustration or agitation, were often suspected of having ulterior motives. They were granted access, but their activities in Anchoril were closely monitored by a "Visitor Assistant"—effectively a government agent—assigned under the guise of helping them coordinate their visit.
This entire screening process was never overtly acknowledged as a security measure. Instead, it was presented under the pretense of ensuring that the visitor fully enjoyed and benefited from their experience in Anchoril.
When the portal wardens at the Welcome Gate wished to deter potential threats or thoroughly vet applicants, they employed a set of initial tasks designed to be time-consuming and complex. These tasks included
* Literacy Test Applicants were required to demonstrate their ability to read and write in Common. This was a fundamental step to ensure visitors understood and complied with local regulations and signs.
* Proof of Identification This step demanded substantial validation of the applicants identity. This part of the process alone spanned several weeks and involved multiple phases. It involved a variety of measures, such as
** Bringing five acquaintances to personally vouch for the applicant.
** Obtaining a written endorsement from a public official, delivered by a bonded messenger.
** Undergoing a magical test, specifically designed by the gnomes.
** Any other creative verification methods the gnomes conceived.
* Proof of Ability to Survive Portals To ensure the safety of travelers and avoid any liability for adverse effects, applicants must show they could safely traverse portals. This might include accompanying a gnome representative through an alternate portal for a health evaluation post-transit.
* Affidavits from Past Travelers to Lantan Applicants were tasked with locating various individuals who had previously visited Lantan. They had to obtain signed official affidavits from these past visitors, certified by a magistrate local to each past visitor.
These tasks, each potentially involving multiple stages, could significantly prolong the application process. Moreover, portal wardens had the discretion to introduce further requirements as they saw fit. This might include completing and notarizing a "Purpose of Visit" form by a gnome located in a different part of the world, or verifying the identities of individuals mentioned in previous documentation, among other potential stipulations. These layered and intricate procedures served both as a rigorous screening mechanism and a deterrent for those not genuinely committed to visiting Lantan.
