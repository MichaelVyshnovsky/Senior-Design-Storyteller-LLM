        "Production": "The main component of adamantine alloy was either pure adamant, or a mixed ferrous ore known as adamantite, found only in veins of ore in volcanic zones.{{cite book/Dwarves Deep|5}}{{Cite polyhedron/75/The Everwinking Eye: Sagely Secrets Made Known|11}}{{Cite dragon/265/Earthstokers|40}} Occasionally, small meteorites consisting of some adamantite would fall to [[Abeir-Toril]] as well.{{cite dungeon/176/Fantastic Terrain: Elemental Motes|71}} Adamantite ores came in brown-gold, blue-silver and green-silver hues; drow mostly mined black ores.
