It was found in many places throughout Toril and beyond.\nPure tin weighed  per , with its various alloys tending to weigh a little less. Tin had a very low melting point of , low enough to be melted down in most ovens, and flash-melted by fireball and lightning bolt spells. Prior to the Time of Troubles, tin required a significant amount of progress on a psionicists part before it could be synthesized through molecular rearrangement.\nWhen left submerged in seawater, tin gained a green patina, and collected coral and barnacle growth.\nAuroras Emporium sold pure tin in various forms. A customer could buy  bars (2 sp),  ingots (5 sp),  square sheets (2 sp),  by  strips (3 cp), and  of wire (1 cp).\nThe distant Winterspace world of Radole had seas of molten tin with islands of half-melted lead.\nthumb|A piece of tin-bearing ore.\nThe primary source of tin was the mineral ore cassiterite, known in the Realms as the precious stone raindrop and the ornamental stone woodtine, mined by folk called \"tinners\".\n* The dwarves of the Great Rift mined tin from the settlement of Rimmator.\n* The dwarves of Clan Herlinga mined tin from the Hagga Shan mountains and sold the metal ingots to merchants from Naupau in Sossal.\n* In Kozakura, the island of Tenmei had tin, copper, and silver mines operated by korobokuru, exported through Tanegawa. Nearby, the small island of Tanekashima also had a number of tin mines operated by korobokuru.\n* Gnomes often worked tin, especially when living among other races. They were skilled at etching and casting such metals.\nthumb|A piece of tinplate.\n* Tin was commonly alloyed with copper to make bronze,\n* Small, cheap items were made of tin, such as plates, buckets, cups, candle-holders, tankards, and lanterns.\n* Tinplate was a form of weather-resistant steel that was coated in a thin layer of tin dissolved in oil of vitriol.\n* Tin tuning forks could be used to access the Elemental Plane of Air, and the Quasi-Elemental Planes of Lightning and Vacuum.\n* Tin golems were a lesser form of golem. Metagolems could also be made of tin, but werent especially effective.\n* Gondar priests were fond of collecting little bits of material that might come in handy, such as tin.\n* Sembian governmental officials carried or wore licenses to prove their authority, usually made of tin but occasionally zinc or electrum.\nThe realm of Asram had access to iron and tin, but lacked copper and zinc completely.\nCirca 1367 DR, Ashabenford was home to a Zhentarim spy, Arvien Blackhair, who worked as a tinsmith and pewtersmith. \nA large number of the inhabitants of Tasseldale were craftsmen, and many of them were tinsmiths. They imported tin and other metals from places such as Sembia or Archendale and then exported the crafts made from them.\nAround the same year, in the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, tin was often mined by slaves under command of their efreeti masters.\nThe temples of UChan Gompa were decorated with hanging dragon sculptures made of tin."
