'''Zinc''' was a metal found in the [[Realms]].

==Properties==
Zinc weighed {{SI|445|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot|l|long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}} Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], zinc required some progress on a [[psionicist]]'s part before it could be synthesized through ''[[molecular rearrangement]]''. The metal melted at 420 degrees Celsius (788 degrees Fahrenheit).

It had such metaphysical properties that a properly calibrated [[tuning fork]] could be used to send a planar traveler to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], and to associated planes.{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|43}}

==Applications==
At least two known alloys of copper and zinc were considered brass: red brass with 20% zinc, and yellow brass with 30% zinc.{{Cite dragon/123/Fire for Effect!|35}} It was also used widely by apothecaries.{{cite book/Realms of Infamy/And Wringing of Hands|248}}

Zinc found much use in the making of [[material component]]s. The object needed for ''[[Bigby's clenched fist]]'' was made of an alloy of [[copper]] and zinc,{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume One|81}} as was the one for ''[[Mordenkainen's sword]]''.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2nd edition|235}}{{cite book/Player's Handbook 1st edition|88-89}}{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Three|599}}{{cite book/Player's Handbook v.3.5|257}} Pure zinc was instead used for ''[[magic mirror]]''.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2nd edition|203}}{{cite book/Player's Handbook v.3.5|235}}

==History==
Zinc was sold at [[Radman]], the enclave of [[Karsus]], at 7 [[gp]] for a brick weighing {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}}. After the fall of [[Netheril]], [[Anauria]]'s best forges in [[Anauril]] were plagued by a lack of the metal; [[Asram]], on the other hand, found its supply in secret places in the [[Great Sand Sea]]. By the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was available through [[Aurora's Emporium]], which sold a {{SI|1|inch|c|long=yes}} square as a [[material component]] for 1 [[sp]].

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], zinc was smelted at [[King's Reach]] in [[the Vast]].{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part Three|4}} [[Sembian]] licenses were sometimes made of zinc.{{Cite web/Realmslore/Melvos Hammerstars, Part Three}}

Zinc's use in the fashioning of [[brass]] was also known to the [[lacerials]] and [[oscray]] of [[Malatra]].{{cite web/Living Jungle/Jungle Stories|3}} Other alloys, called make-metals, were made of zinc.{{cite web/Waterdeep News/Sharp Rise in Silversheen}} Another zinc alloy was [[halduthra]].{{cite web/theedverse/2021-03-29 - Bloodstone trade bars}}

==Notable Mines==
The most important ore of zinc was [[Wikipedia:sphalerite|sphalerite]], a yellow-brown, hard yet brittle ore weighing about 250 pounds per cubic foot<!--There's no way to convert this correctly with the template. Leave it the way it is.--> (4 grams per cubic centimeter).{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}}

The mines at the [[Gnoll Peaks]] north of [[Hillmarch]] provided a modest amount of zinc.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to Cormyr|184}}

It was mined in [[Dis]], within the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|25}}
