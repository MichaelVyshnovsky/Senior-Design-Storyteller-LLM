        "mainbody": "'''Sealing wax''' was a type of [[wax]] used to make seals and insignia. As this adhesive wax was used to seal both letters and legal contracts, and forgers.",
        "Description": "This type of wax naturally grew on [[palm]]s native to the islands of the [[Djinni's Claws]] in [[Zakhara]].\n\nBeeswax was often used as sealing wax, and was sold in [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]. The wax could be colored for an additional cost. The same catalog sold proper sealing wax for scribes.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Hardbuckler]] [[gnome]]s produced a unique type of green seam-sealing wax. It was exported and sold in rolls of cloth. This type sold for 1 [[sp]] per tube. Later, an improved model was created, which functioned as long as [[oil]] was worked into it once per year. The green wax tube would turn purple if one tried to enchant it.",
        "Properties": "This sticky substance was sometimes scented. Scented sealing wax could be exchanged for tokens won at the [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]] of [[Ravens Bluff]].",
        "Applications": "This substance could be stamped by [[signet ring]]s worn by both nobles and knights. Sealing wax could be found in [[forgery kit]]s and [[diplomat's kits]].\n\nIn order to use a tube of sealing wax, one first had to unroll the bottom end of the protective cloth and squeeze the upper part. The wax could then be driven out of the tube and applied to a material.",
        "Production": "Sealing wax was mostly produced in settlements, as thus was in very poor supply in the wilderness.",
        "Notable Related Items": "* The ''[[Stamp of the Messenger]]'' was a [[Waterdhavian]] [[magic]] item that produced its own sealing wax. When the possessor of the artifact folded the envelope, it would automatically be sealed by the hot wax. The item came in both [[silver]] and [[gold]] varieties, and the latter could sell for up to 5,000 [[gp]]."
