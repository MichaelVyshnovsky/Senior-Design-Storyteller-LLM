Titansteel, sometimes known as relic iron, was a worked and surface-hardened alloy of iron known to be both stronger and lighter than common steel.
Titansteel was half the weight of regular steel, and was both harder and more resistant to corrosion.

Titansteel could be used to fashion weapons, armor, shields, and other metal items such as nails and bolts. Chainmail made of titansteel was deceptively strong for how lightweight it was.
As a commodity, titansteel was very expensive. It was most commonly traded in ingots, plates, and rings.
As of the late 15 century DR, ingots of ancient titansteel found throughout the North were more commonly referred to as "relic iron", and were used to produce modern titansteel. Such production methods often involved the use of gems in the smithing process, such as molybdenum or sphene.
During the events of the death curse, buyers in Port Nyanzaru became interested in importing titansteel weapons and armor. The guard captain Uponga Naodha recognized that metal armor was both desirable to protect his men, but heavy and cumbersome in the Chultan heat. Meanwhile, Silaha Mnunzi sought axes, claymores, and lances of titansteel on behalf of the merchant prince Ekene-Afa, who controlled the sale of weapons in the city.
