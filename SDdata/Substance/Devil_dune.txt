'''Devil dunes''' were a kind of animated [[magic]]al hazard made of [[sand]] that were found, albeit rarely, in sandy deserts and wastelands.

==Properties==
Mundane or even magically sped sand dunes could move at most several feet per hour, only threatening to smother sleeping creatures overnight and bury cities over long periods. By comparison, a devil dune possessed a kind of animosity towards interlopers, seeming to actively hunt down and destroy invaders inside its domain.

A typical devil dune was approximately {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} long, {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} wide, and {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} tall. When pursuing a victim, it could reach speeds of about {{SI|600|ft|long=yes}} per minute, or {{SI|6.8|mile|k|long=yes}} per hour. A devil dune had an intrinsic ability to know where a trespasser was in its domain, and was able to relentlessly pursue it for as long as it was present.

Once a devil dune "caught" a victim, it buried them alive inside its bulk, eventually smothering them if escape was not effected. There was no known means of permanently destroying or stopping a devil dune, with ''[[soften earth and stone]]'' slowing one down for a time, and ''[[earthquake]]'' shattering and dispersing its form for several weeks.

==Occurrences==
Devil dunes were thankfully rare, but were known to exist in the [[Anauroch]] desert.
