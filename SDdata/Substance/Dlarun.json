        "mainbody": "Dlarun, also known as icesteel, was a non-natural white metal that was unknown to most peoples of Faerûn, save for select groups of halflings. The \"good folk\" were quite secretive about their knowledge of dlarun, often giving misleading descriptions or feigning ignorance if it was ever brought up in conversation.\nThis lightweight metal was bone white in color with a high polish that shone green when illuminated by candles or magical sources of light. Considering it was a more esoteric substance, it could easily be mistaken for ivory.\nDlarun was often used in the creation of small figurines, engraved plates, or the pommels of weapons, often in the shape of an acorn, claw, or other symbols of nature. If a piece of magical jewelry or other decorative item made from dlarun came into contact with the wearers skin, it would confer to the wearer a limited ability allowing them to see through illusions and ignore certain psionic effects. Armor crafted from the metal offered limited protection from fire, and weapons would strike with an icy frost. \nThis unique metal was not suited for the creation of items that were intended to carry an enchantment related to flame, such as a flame tongue.\nFollowers of Urogalan sometimes gave unworked dlarun as offerings during an Earthrising ceremony and some priests of He Who Must Be used a statuette of a hound made of dlarun as their holy symbol.\nThe formation of dlarun involved digging up clay from certain river beds located throughout Faerûn, heating them up in a crucible and mixing the resulting white flakes with certain oils. The soft, malleable metal was then heated again in a fire whose fuel included specific, secret elements."
