'''Crumblestone''' was a very brittle type of rock.

==History==
Crumblestone was notorious for how brittle and therefore dangerous it was to miners and travelers in the [[Underdark]].

==Properties==
As mentioned above, crumblestone was brittle: it turned into powder when weight was applied, for example when a flying creature or a climber stepped on it. This might cause climbers to fall and die, but was mostly harmless for a flying creature. A larger problem occurred when this rock was part of a delicate balance with surrounding stone, which was upset once the crumblestone broke and might cause a fall or even a cave-in.

==Applications==
A suggested use of the [[spell]] ''[[stone metamorphosis]]'' was to turn crumblestone into something more stable like [[granite]] when encountered.

==Production==
Crumblestone was a [[magimorphic rock]]. This meant that this type of rock came into being as a result of magic and was not natural.
