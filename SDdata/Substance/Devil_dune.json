        "mainbody": "Devil dunes were a kind of animated magical hazard made of sand that were found, albeit rarely, in sandy deserts and wastelands.\nMundane or even magically sped sand dunes could move at most several feet per hour, only threatening to smother sleeping creatures overnight and bury cities over long periods. By comparison, a devil dune possessed a kind of animosity towards interlopers, seeming to actively hunt down and destroy invaders inside its domain.\nA typical devil dune was approximately  long,  wide, and  tall. When pursuing a victim, it could reach speeds of about  per minute, or  per hour. A devil dune had an intrinsic ability to know where a trespasser was in its domain, and was able to relentlessly pursue it for as long as it was present.\nOnce a devil dune \"caught\" a victim, it buried them alive inside its bulk, eventually smothering them if escape was not effected. There was no known means of permanently destroying or stopping a devil dune, with soften earth and stone slowing one down for a time, and earthquake shattering and dispersing its form for several weeks.\nDevil dunes were thankfully rare, but were known to exist in the Anauroch desert."
