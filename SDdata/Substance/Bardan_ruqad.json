        "mainbody": "'''''Bardan ruqad''''', which translated in [[Midani]] as \"cold sleep\", was a rare poison.",
        "Properties": "''Bardan ruqad'' was a strong poison capable of instantly paralyzing the victim. Victims under the poison's effect remained helplessly inert for up to ten minutes. They were completely aware of what was happening to them during this time, after which they fell into a deep slumber that lasted several hours. This poison did not cause any physical harm in the traditional sense.\n\n''Bardan ruqad'' even worked against all forms of [[undead]], though they were slightly resistant to its effects when initially taking root.",
        "Applications": "Though rarely encountered outside of their use of the poison, [[Tasked genie|tasked]] [[messenger genie]]s often applied ''bardan ruqad'' to their darts and daggers. The messenger genies used this to attack dangerous targets from a distance when delivering messages to them, allowing them to paralyze the target and safely deliver the message and escape before the target could retaliate."
