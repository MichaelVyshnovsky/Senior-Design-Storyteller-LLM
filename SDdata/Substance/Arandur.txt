'''Arandur''' was a naturally-occurring metal found within igneous rock throughout [[Toril]].

==Description==
Arandur was a blue-green streaked metal that appeared within pockets of [[hyaline]] glass. After refinement and final forging, it turned a silver-blue color

The metal bonded extremely well with others, so much so that the [[spell]] ''[[crown meld]]'' was not needed when [[Item enchantment|enchanting]] items that had a component made of arandur.

==Use==
The process of refining arandur ore was previously a secret of the [[gnome]]s, but has since been shared with the [[elves]] of [[Evereska]]. To prevent arandur from being brittle after it was mined, it was tempered with the blood of either [[red dragon|red]] or [[blue dragon]]s. As such, the extremely skilled smiths that were capable of working with the metal, used it in a diverse selection of items, from gnomish locks and tackle to the legendary elven [[warblades]]. 

Blades forged from arandur held a sharp edge even after much abuse. Armor and shields that were made from the metal were resistant to sonic waves, elemental forces, acid, [[magic]]al force and even ''[[Disintegrate|disintegration]]''. It was said that armament forged from arandur could even completely absorb the [[arcane]] released by a ''[[magic missile]]'' spell.
