        "mainbody": "Thistledown was a type of expensive elven textile, greatly valued in the Realms as the material used to create cloaks of elvenkind.\nThistledown was a fine quality grayish fabric. It was impressively light and seemingly immune to being snagged by the forest branches and shrubbery. Its light weight and color was the reason the material was named after plant down that carried seeds with the wind. The fabric was also predisposed for easy enchantment.\nApart from being used to weave cloaks of elvenkind, thistledown fabric was also used to make lightweight padded armor, such as thistledown suits, favored by arcane magicusers.\n* Lehland, an elven merchant who lived in the Hand of the Seldarine. He still sold moth-taten thistledown as a ghost, after the citadels fall."
