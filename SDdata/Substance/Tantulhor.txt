'''Tantulhor''' was a metal only found in the [[Nine Hells]].{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|26}} Seldom found outside the infernal planes, it reached very high prices when sold on the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Properties==
By itself, tantulhor was almost unbreakable. Weapons forged from this metal could cut about anything, except stone.

===Alloying===
Tantulhor could be alloyed with [[arjale]] and [[silver]] to create an extremely durable yet pliable metal, of untarnished silvery color with flecks of green.

==Applications==
Tantulhor was used in the creation of [[:category:magic items|magic items]] such as the [[demonshield]]s of the [[Shoon Imperium]] or the [[rod]] of [[Dispater]]. It was also used to create the [[talisman]] of many [[devil]]s such as [[Zagan]] or the [[hamatula]]s.

==Production==
Tantulhor was mined by [[nupperibo]]s and [[spinagon]]s in [[Phlegethos]]{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|28-29}} They could also be found in [[Malbolge]] and [[Maladomini]], where it was less abundant.
