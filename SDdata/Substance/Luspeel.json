        "mainbody": "Luspeel was the Realms name for a hardstone also known as magnetite or lodestone.\nLuspeel appeared as a hard, black metallic stone.\nLuspeel was an ore of iron, but was notable for being naturally magnetic. Though it held no magic, luspeel possessed a natural property to attract lightning, especially if mined from a particularly potent vein.\nLodestones were used or sold by chandlers, navigators, astronomers, and magical supply shops.\nA typical price for large quantities of this hardstone was three gold pieces per .\nAuroras Emporium sold reagent-quality lodestones through its catalogue for 5 sp per . Refined magnets could also be obtained in 1 inch (5 sp), 2 inch (1gp) and 3 inch (3 gp) cubes.\n* An enormous deposit of lodestone beneath the Crowded Sea near the Steaming Isles was strong enough to affect ships passing over the surface, potentially killing the crew as metal objects shifted and crushed them, or tearing the ship apart as they shattered the hull. This phenomenon was responsible for the typical nail-free shipbuilding of Zakhara.\n* The Mountain of Iron in the Hordelands possessed huge quantities of lodestone, and could pull and trap metal-clad travelers from the surrounding area.\n* A suspended lodestone would be gently pulled north, serving as a crude compass.\n* Lodestone magnets could be used in various spells, as well as mundane purposes such as holding ink pens, or esoteric purposes such as polarizing ionized liquids. They were broadly used in laboratories thanks to their versatility.\n* Luspeel was occasionally used in the floors of temples to subtly encourage pietyâ€”a kneeling worshiper felt his or her weapons and armor being gently stuck to the floor.\n* Gnomes devised simple locks that used an iron pin hidden behind a wooden door panel, only accessible if a lodestone was used to pull the pin into place.\n* Lodestones could be used with iron filings to investigate magical effects, looking for disturbances in the iron filings.\n* The affinity for lightning made luspeel useful in the manufacture of magical items and affixing enchantments. It was especially necessary for tempering swords that were intended to be bound with multiple enchantments.\n* The lightning-attracting property of this mundane stone made it invaluable in countering certain types of spells. One such spell was Obolds brightness. When a lodestone was tossed in the spells area of effect, the lightning sparks became focused on the stone, quickly draining brightness of its energy. This tool was used by Halruaan Jordaini.\n* An arrow of disintegration used an arrowhead made of lodestone.\n* The pieces of the Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre were carved from this stone so they would gently be attracted to a steel chessboard.\n* Chevics tracer required lodestone shaped into a cube in order to cast.\n* Disintegrate used a lodestone and a pinch of dust.\n* Some versions of the spell mending could be cast by using two lodestones.\n* Reverse gravity required a single lodestone to cast.\n* Sense direction used a small lodestone.\n* Storms swordfire required a lump of lodestone the size of its casters mouth to be cast.\n* Swordward required a bit of lodestone as one of its material components.\n* True compass used a lodestone and needle.\n* Web of lightning required four lodestones to cast.\n* Lodestone marauder were hulking creatures that devoured metal and had powerful magnetic abilities, allowing them to repulse and pull metal objects and people attached to them.\n* A rust monster lodestone was a rust monster that had consumed too much magnetized material and lost to ability to corrode metal, instead gaining the ability to manipulate magnetic fields.\nShaundakuls Tavern in Trailstone had a novel countertop made from a large lodestone slab, allegedly recovered from a ruined temple of Shaundakul by the brother of the owner Mier Ompson."
