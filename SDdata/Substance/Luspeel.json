        "Occurrences": "* An enormous deposit of lodestone beneath the [[Crowded Sea]] near the [[Steaming Isles]] was strong enough to affect ships passing over the surface, potentially killing the crew as metal objects shifted and crushed them, or tearing the ship apart as they shattered the hull. This phenomenon was responsible for the typical [[nail]]-free shipbuilding of [[Zakhara]].\n* The [[Mountain of Iron]] in the [[Hordelands]] possessed huge quantities of [[lodestone]], and could pull and trap metal-clad travelers from the surrounding area.",
        "Usage": {
            "Magic": "* Lodestones could be used with iron filings to investigate magical effects, looking for disturbances in the iron filings.\n* The affinity for lightning made luspeel useful in the manufacture of magical items and affixing [[enchantment]]s. It was especially necessary for tempering [[sword]]s that were intended to be bound with multiple enchantments.\n* The lightning-attracting property of this mundane stone made it invaluable in countering certain types of [[spell]]s. One such spell was ''[[Obold's brightness]]''. When a lodestone was tossed in the spell's area of effect, the lightning sparks became focused on the stone, quickly draining ''brightness'' of its energy. This tool was used by [[Halruaan]] [[Jordaini]].\n* An ''[[arrow of disintegration]]'' used an arrowhead made of lodestone.{{Cite dragon/135/Bazaar of the Bizarre|21}}\n* The pieces of the ''[[Magical Chessmen of Ultham-Urre]]'' were carved from this stone so they would gently be attracted to a steel [[Chess (game)|chessboard]].",
            "Spell Components": "* ''[[Chevic's tracer]]'' required lodestone shaped into a cube in order to cast.\n* ''[[Disintegrate]]'' used a lodestone and a pinch of dust.\n* Some versions of the spell ''[[mending]]'' could be cast by using two lodestones.\n* ''[[Reverse gravity]]'' required a single lodestone to cast.\n* ''[[Sense direction]]'' used a small lodestone.{{Cite dragon/142/Arcane Lore: Spells of the Wild Cult|63}}\n* ''[[Storm's swordfire]]'' required a lump of lodestone the size of its caster's mouth to be cast.\n* ''[[Swordward]]'' required a bit of lodestone as one of its material components.\n* ''[[True compass]]'' used a lodestone and needle.{{Cite dragon/235/Arcane Lore: Sea Spells|52}}\n* ''[[Web of lightning]]'' required four lodestones to cast."

        "Creatures": "* [[Lodestone marauder]] were hulking creatures that devoured metal and had powerful magnetic abilities, allowing them to repulse and pull metal objects and people attached to them.\n* A [[rust monster lodestone]] was a [[rust monster]] that had consumed too much magnetized material and lost to ability to corrode metal, instead gaining the ability to manipulate magnetic fields.{{Cite dragon/376/Ecology of the Rust Monster|30}}",
        "History": "[[Shaundakul's Tavern]] in [[Trailstone]] had a novel countertop made from a large lodestone slab, allegedly recovered from a ruined temple of [[Shaundakul]] by the brother of the owner [[Mier Ompson]]."
