==History==
Around the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s were tasked with obtaining a list of supplies for the [[alchemist]] [[Wendell]]. Among the listed ingredients was a single bottle of hydrochloric acid.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3,16}} When they approached the store [[Supreme Supplies]] they found a small sign on the front door that read "Closed due to Pest Infestation". Its owner, [[Syrondario]], was sitting on the bench outside and quickly approached them as they got close his shop, asking them politely to avoid his shop and explaining that earlier in the day some "clumsy oaf" had brought in a large jar full of [[bookworm]]s. The jar broke whilst they were inside and infested his shop.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|10}}<ref group="note" name="worm">The adventure claims on page 11 that Syrondario is unaware that the bugs within his shop are bookworms and thus does not inform players of the danger inside. Yet on the following page it's shown that he recognizes what they are, cause he knows what their value would be to the neighboring [[wizard]].

Once the adventurers succeeded in their extermination duties, they were able to buy a bottle of hydrochloric acid from the store for 30 [[gold piece]]s.{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|12}}<ref group="note" name="acid">On the page it is referred to only as "acid", but considering the shopping list provided it can be assumed that this is referring to the hydrochloric acid.
