Gorgon mud, referred to in Jotun as fjellblod by the stone giant thane Kayalithica, was a variety of magical mud that carried a petrification effect.
This substance was described by some as being viscous and green, forming pockets within areas of soft ground.
This substance behaved similar to quicksand, gradually dragging victims down into it. When a sinking creature became immersed in gorgon mud, it would become subject to petrification.
Gorgon mud radiated a detectable aura of transmutation magic. When removed from its pool, the substances magical properties became inert.
* Gorgon mud could be found within various alcoves of Deadstone Cleft, where it long acted as a defensive measure for the stone giants that lived there.
* Beyond the Prime Material plane, it was not uncommon to encounter gorgon mud in the Elemental Chaos and in Molor, the 528 layer of the Abyss ruled by Juiblex.
