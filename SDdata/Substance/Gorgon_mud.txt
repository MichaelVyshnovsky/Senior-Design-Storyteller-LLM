'''Gorgon mud''', referred to in [[Giant language|Jotun]] as '''fjellblod''' by the [[stone giant]] thane [[Kayalithica]], was a variety of [[magic]]al mud that carried a [[petrification]] effect.

==Description==
This substance was described by some as being viscous and green, forming pockets within areas of soft ground.

==Properties==
This substance behaved similar to [[quicksand]], gradually dragging victims down into it. When a sinking creature became immersed in gorgon mud, it would become subject to petrification.

Gorgon mud radiated a [[detect magic|detectable]] aura of [[transmutation]] magic. When removed from its pool, the substance's magical properties became inert.

==Availability==
* Gorgon mud could be found within various alcoves of [[Deadstone Cleft]], where it long acted as a defensive measure for the stone giants that lived there.
* Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], it was not uncommon to encounter gorgon mud in the [[Elemental Chaos]] and in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer_528:_Molor|Molor, the 528{{th}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]] ruled by [[Juiblex]].<ref>
