'''Myrrh''' was a natural plant [[resin]] extracted from the [[myrrh tree]].

==Description==
Myrrh was an aromatic resin, similar to [[frankincense]] and [[dragons' blood]].

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold myrrh for 10 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|oz}}, intended for the rituals and practices of [[priest]]s.

Myrrh trees were found in [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]], and harvested by the [[Bedine]]. A raw fist-sized lump of myrrh was worth about 3 gp to the Bedine, but after being exported to other lands the price increased precipitously. It was three times as expensive as frankincense, but one-fifth as popular.

Myrrh was also harvested in [[Zakhara]], with the [[Pearl Cities]] handling much of the trade, especially [[Gana]] and [[Ajayib]].

==Usage==
When heated, myrrh resin broke down into an aromatic oil. The oil of myrrh was used as for religious anointing ceremonies, burnt as a fumigant, and used in embalming processes. It could also be used in small amounts in cooking, and as a medicine by pregnant Bedine women. The resin could be formed into beads and worn on a necklace, allowing natural body warmth to slowly release the fragrance. Various medicinal oils and [[healing potion]]s also used myrrh as an ingredient.

Myrrh was used to make various [[perfume]]s, [[incense]]s, scented [[oil]]s and [[beeswax]].{{Cite dragon/137/Treasures of the Wilds|22}}

Myrrh was a common spice used in [[Turmish]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-10/Turmishan spices}}

Myrrh could be used to make magical candles that emanated ''[[disruption]]'' when lit, damaging and destroying nearby [[undead]]. If a [[cleric]] or [[paladin]] lit the candle, their ability to [[turn undead]] was improved.{{Cite dragon/179/Magic by Candlelight|19}}

Frankincense and myrrh were commonly used in the [[mummy|mummification]] process.{{Cite dragon/300/Shrouded in Death|78}}

==Creatures==
