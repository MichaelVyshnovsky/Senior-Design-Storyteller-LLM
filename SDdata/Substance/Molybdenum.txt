Molybdenum was a rare, useful metal found in the Realms.
The ore of molybdenum, molybdena, was a soft, lustrous black metallic mineral with an appearance similar to plumbago.
The Elemental Store of the Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental molybdenum for 10 gp per ounce.

Molybdenum was prized for its uses in alloys. It was alloyed with adamantine, steel, and titansteel to make strong and durable bolt, rivets, nails, wire, and blades. It improved the weldability of adamantine, and improved the lamination of steel as well as its resistance to rust and corrosion.
