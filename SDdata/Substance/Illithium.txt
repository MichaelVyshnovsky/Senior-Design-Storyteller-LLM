'''Illithium''' was a rare and expensive [[ore]] and a type of alloy sometimes available for purchase from the markets of [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

==Description==
Illithium ore was renowned for its luster and the unique property of never becoming soiled. In its pure form, illithium was exceedingly rare and next to impossible to find in huge quantities. In some usages, illithium was made into an alloy.

==Usages==
Illithium could be used to improve a ''[[mace of disruption]]'', strengthening its magics and making it more deadly to the [[undead]]. In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], such work was performed by [[Cromwell]], a blacksmith from Athkatla in Amn.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir [[Sarles]] of the [[Jysstev Estate]] sought {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}} of pure illithium ore to work on a piece commissioned by the [[Church of Helm]]. The only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who occasionally had access to the elusive material was [[Jerlia]], who ran her business from the [[Waukeen's Promenade]]. Despite Sir Sarles's demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to {{SI|50|lb|k|long=yes}} of illithium ore per season. She also revealed that her source of the substance was a [[duergar]] merchant, [[Unger Hilldark]], operating out of the [[Copper Coronet]]. Coincidentally, a serial killer named [[Neb]] stole a huge shipment of illithium from the duergar trader around the same time.

It is unknown if Sir Sarles was able to finish his commission. There were several possible outcomes of the events. Sarles may have been presented with a significantly less valuable illithium alloy instead, allowing him to finish the commission without realizing the metal's true nature, unless the fake illithium angered the sculptor and made him leave Athkatla in fury. Alternatively, true illithium could've been retrieved from Neb and used to sculpt the Church of Helm's commission.
