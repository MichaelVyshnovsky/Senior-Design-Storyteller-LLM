'''Leather''' was the processed hide or skin of an animal, widely used in [[Faerûn]] and beyond for various crafts. It was produced by tanners through the process of [[tanning]].

==Description==
Leather could be made from the skin of practically any animal, though each had their advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common hides used came from [[cow]]s, [[ox]]en, [[rothé]], [[horse]]s, and [[donkey]]s, which had large and durable skins. The hides of [[deer]], [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[lion]]s, [[manticore]]s, and other beasts were also desirable, though harder to obtain. Scaly hides such as from [[bulette]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[dragon]]s could also be used like leather, but the product was quite different.

==Production==
In some areas, the professions of skinners, tanners, and leatherworkers were controlled or regulated by trade [[guild]]s, like the [[League of Skinners and Tanners]] in [[Waterdeep]], which supplied the bulk of leather used by artisans of other guilds such as the [[Saddlers' and Harness-makers' Guild]], [[Order of Cobblers and Corvisers]], and [[Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers]].

Tools used in leatherworking included the [[round knife]], the [[swivel knife]], and the [[awl]], which were each highly specialized tools adapted for carefully cutting leather.

==Usage==
Leather was broadly used for all sorts of durable and flexible goods, ranging from practical heavy-duty waterproof gear to luxurious accoutrements. This included [[belt]]s, [[shoe]]s, [[boots]], [[gloves]], [[hat]]s, [[bracer]]s, [[breeches]], [[cloak]]s, [[apron]]s, [[riding tack]], [[saddle]]s, [[armor]], [[scabbard]]s, [[pouch]]s and [[bag]]s, [[shield]]s, [[waterskin]]s, [[Leather ball|balls]], [[strop]]s, [[baldric]]s, [[whip]]s, and more. Even when not the main material, leather was used as a flexible connective material or underlay for other materials like suits of [[plate armor]].

Smooth scaly hides from creatures like lizards or dragons were often brittle or slippery, making them inappropriate for items that required a firm grip like weapon handles.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}

[[Parchment]] was a writing surface made from thin sections of hide, carefully prepared. [[Vellum]] was a particularly thin and delicate high-quality surface made from calfskin.
