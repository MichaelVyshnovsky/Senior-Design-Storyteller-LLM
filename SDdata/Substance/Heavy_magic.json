To start with, they drained magic from the land, as well as nourishment from both raw and produced food. Karsus, however, discovered this drain, and tried to find a way to somehow counter the effects of the phaerimm. The mad [[arcanist]] would experiment with the uses of heavy magic, and even created a [[mouse]]-delivery system where mice transported globs of heavy magic to fill cracks in old walls. \n\nHeavy magic gained much experimental use throughout the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Karsus (enclave)|Karsus]]. The [[Museum of Heavy Magic]] was constructed, which showed off the various effects of heavy magic experimentation.",
