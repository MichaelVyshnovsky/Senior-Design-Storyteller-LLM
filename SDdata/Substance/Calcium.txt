* Hot springs contained mineral-rich water that left deposits of calcium carbonate behind.
* [[Gypsum]] was made of calcium [[sulfur|sulfate]], and created naturally-sculpted [[crystal flower]]s. Stalactites and stalagmites were made of "dripstone", calcium carbonate left behind by dripping water.{{Cite dragon/249/Dungeon Mastery: Deep Meanings|100}}
* The [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals]] turned to calcium near the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].{{Cite dragon/73/From the Sorcerer's Scroll: The Inner Planes|11}}
