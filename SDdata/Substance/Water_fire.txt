Water fire was a type of otherworldly substance known to the people of Kara-Tur that could be created by pan lungs and shen lungs whenever they were in contact with water, surrounding their bodies with it like a protective aura.
Water fire bore a resemblance to fire, but was more ghostly in appearance. It constantly flickered and shifted in color between multiple hues.
It was harmful to any creature that came into contact with it, except for lung dragons. The degree to which the flames harmed a creature differed depending upon which type of lung dragon created the water fire, with the flames of a shen lung being the more harmful of the two, as well as depending upon the age of the lung dragon that produced it. Older pan lungs and shen lungs were capable of creating more potently destructive water fire.
The substance could be dissipated by bringing it into contact with mundane fire or any sort of magical fire.
While some described their capacity to create this substance as limitless, others believed pan lungs and shen lungs could only create water fire three times per day. Accounts similarly differed on how much time had to pass before they could produce water fire again. The former put this period from anywhere between 20 to 120 minutes, while the latter put it around anywhere from 2 to 12 minutes.
