        "mainbody": "anguis Anima was an alchemical fluid that could be used as a conversion poison. It was first mentioned to be used to animate a flesh golem.\nThe poison was deadly to any mortal humanoid, as it coursed through his or her veins.\nSanguis Anima could be used to animate flesh golems, as a means of extending their lifespan or physically invigorating them. According to a treatise upon flesh golems, written by Imphraili Asserbai, it would enhance \"languid, wholly inefficient flesh golems of our day\". The golem had to then be electrocuted, and was then ready to serve its master(s). The golems, however, could not stand sunlight.\nAs a potent poison, it could be used to exploit weaknesses of monstrous creatures. A skilled alchemist or enchanter could concoct a specially tailored conversion poison capable of destroying the Viciscamera.\nImphraili stated that the procedure was insanely dangerous and that only a specialist transmutator could go ahead with it. It required the imbiber to alter the state of the substance by magical means. If the production of the Sanguis Anima went wrong, the producer would become poisoned. The use of an alchemical laboratory was needed to produce the substance.\nSome of the ingredients to produce such a substance could only be found in the Underdark. The proper chemicals to make up Sanguis Anima were\n* Giant myconid fungi spores, found in some regions of caverns in the Underdark.\n* A vial of silvery fluid found in pools in the Underdark. The fluid could be identified by its heatless molten metal and viscous liquid webbing appearance.\n* Other minor reagants."
