        "Availability": "* Bromine salts were refined from seawater alongside regular salt production.\n* Alkaline lakes in [[Zakhara]]'s deserts such as the [[Pit of the Ghuls]] were a source of [[alkaline salt]]s, bromine salts, and table salt, but were often too remote and dangerous to exploit.\n* [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold bromine salts for 1 [[gp]] per {{SI|12|oz}}.",
        "Usages": "* Bromine salts were used in wizard's laboratories for various processes.\n* ''[[Airy water]]'' could use a small handful of bromine salts as a [[material component]].\n* ''[[Otiluke's bubbling buoyancy]]'' used a small [[cork]] and a pinch of bromine salt for its material components."
