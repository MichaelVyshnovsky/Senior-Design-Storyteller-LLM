'''Mummy dust''' was a type of [[material component]] used in the casting of numerous spells. As its name suggested, it was the desiccated remnants of a [[mummy]].

==Applications==
Mummy dust was known to be used as a material component for at least three [[necromancy]] spells: ''[[mummy (spell)|mummy]]'', ''[[mummy touch]]'' and the eponymous ''[[mummy dust (spell)|mummy dust]]''.

It was also used in the creation of [[magical item]]s with powers related to [[disease]] and natural rot.

==Production==
Mummy dust gathered from a mummy who was slain by means of exposure to [[violine]] [[gemstone]] became inert and unusable for any arcane usage.

==Value==
A dosage of specially prepared mummy dust could fetch upwards of 10,000 [[gp]] as of the early [[Era of Upheaval]].

==History==
As of the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], mummy dust was available for purchase within [[Bendekar's Mercantile]] in the [[Ravens Bluff/Mortonbrace|Mortonbrace]] neighborhood of [[Ravens Bluff]].

==Notable Users==
* [[Skabatha Nightshade]], a [[hag]] of the [[Hourglass Coven]] kept at least one vial of mummy dust within her library in [[Motherhorn]].
