        "mainbody": "Milk of the Maiden was a strange substance that completely healed anyone submerged in it with the blessing of Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain, during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe mixture was made from a secret combination of tree saps and plant oils.\nThe high priestess within the House of Spires temple, Chalathra Nyndra, used an ancient draconic spell on the mixture of plant saps and oils to create the Milk of the Maiden. The Loviatans of the temple fiercely guarded the strange liquid, and would hunt down anyone who tried to steal it."
