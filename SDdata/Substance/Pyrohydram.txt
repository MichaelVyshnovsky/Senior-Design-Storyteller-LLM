'''Pyrohydram''' was a rare metal used by the [[janni]] to make musical pipe [[instruments]].

==Usages==
Pyrohydram ore was smelted into metal that possessed curious musical properties. When made into wind instruments, pyrohydram pipes were heated by the musician's breath during performances, producing a "sonorous and grandiose timbre" unique to the instruments made out of this metal.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, [[Eryk]], an adventuring friend of [[Thomas C. Quirkilious]], the proprietor of [[Chromatic Scale]] in the [[Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], was introduced to pyrohydram by a [[janni]] trader. Eryk believed that his friend would be able to make some unique [[flute]]s out of pyrohydram and procured a bagful of ore samples to bring back to the Gate.
