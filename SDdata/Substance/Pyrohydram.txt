Pyrohydram was a rare metal used by the janni to make musical pipe instruments.
Pyrohydram ore was smelted into metal that possessed curious musical properties. When made into wind instruments, pyrohydram pipes were heated by the musicians breath during performances, producing a "sonorous and grandiose timbre" unique to the instruments made out of this metal.
In the , Eryk, an adventuring friend of Thomas C. Quirkilious, the proprietor of Chromatic Scale in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate, was introduced to pyrohydram by a janni trader. Eryk believed that his friend would be able to make some unique flutes out of pyrohydram and procured a bagful of ore samples to bring back to the Gate.
