'''Lead''' was a versatile, cheap, and heavy metal produced and worked on [[Toril]].

==Properties==
Pure lead weighed {{SI|710|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot||long=yes}}, making it one of the heaviest metals in the [[Realms]].{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}} Lead had a low melting point at {{SI|621|F}}{{Cite dragon/123/Fire for Effect!|35}} and could be melted by most kilns, specialized ovens, or other sources of extreme heat such as the ''[[fireball]]'' and ''[[lightning bolt]]'' spells.

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold lead in many forms. A customer could buy {{SIAdj|1|lb|k|long=yes}} bars ( 5–7 [[cp]]),<ref group="note" name="Bar weight">The original text states 7 cp for 2 lb bars, but this is inconsistent with other metals sold, and also makes very poor business sense for [[Aurora]]. {{SIAdj|10|lb|k|long=yes}} ingots (5 [[sp]]), {{SIAdj|5|inch|c|long=yes}} square sheets (4 cp), {{SIAdj|4|inch|c|long=yes}} by {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} strips (3 cp), and {{SIAdj|1|foot|c|long=yes}} of wire (4 cp). Wizardly reagents were also supported, with 1-inch cubes of lead (6 cp).

In the time of ancient [[Netheril]], the [[Elemental Store]] of [[Karsus Enclave]] sold pure elemental lead for 21 [[gp]] per ounce.

The far-off [[Winterspace]] world of [[Radole]] had seas of molten [[tin]] metal, with islands of half-melted lead.

===Mining & Trade===
Lead was mined in the form of [[wikipedia:galena|galena]], a soft, gray, crystalline ore.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}}{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|7}}

* The [[Galena Mountains]] were home to rich deposits of galena and other minerals, as befitting their name.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-09-20 - Galena Mountains Geology}}
* The village of [[Auvandell]] mined lead as well as [[iron]] and [[copper]] that was sent to [[Sundabar]].
* The rocky tors of the [[Evermoors]] possessed rich veins of lead, [[silver]], and [[gold]], with some veins so soft that they could be dug out with a blunt [[sword]] or fire-hardened stick.
* The [[Great Rift]] settlement of [[Glitterdelve]] mined lead, iron, silver, gold, and copper.
* The [[Smoking Mountains]] in [[Unther]] had lead, iron, copper, and gold, mined by folk from [[Dalath]].

==Usage==
* [[Bullet]]s for [[sling]]s and [[firearm]]s were made from lead.{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|40}}
* [[Paint]]s could be made from lead, with red and white pigments.
* Fishing sinkers were often made of lead.
* Tools and weapons such as [[sap]]s and [[mallet]]s could be weighted with a lead core to give them extra heft.
* [[Glass]] windows were assembled from small panes of glass set in place with lead filler, making leaded windows.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/04-07 - Glass, Ceramics, & Hospitality}}
* Corked bottles could be sealed with lead to give an even more reliable seal.

===Spell Components===

|That leaded pigments and gilded decorations traditionally cover the walls in the quarters of ladies-in-waiting and other rooms of a castle cannot be taken either as proof or disproof of the ring’s original intent, but certainly it might thwart the fancies of an adventurer who found such a ring.

Lead generally blocked [[divination]] magic, even in thin sheets of foil. Spells affected in this manner included ''[[detect animals or plants]]'', ''[[detect chaos]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect poison]]'', ''[[detect snares and pits]]'', and ''[[message]]'', as well as the [[Church of Mask|Maskarran]] spells ''[[listening shadow]]'' and ''[[watching shadow]]''. The ''[[ring of X-ray vision]]'' was also blocked by lead sheeting. For this reason, buildings such as the [[House of the Moon]], a temple to [[Selûne]] in [[Waterdeep]], and the [[Diviner Guildhall]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] had lead lining, as well as [[gorgon]]'s blood [[mortar]] cementing their outer walls.{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}}

The [[philosopher's stone]] was renowned for its ability to transmute lead into gold and iron into silver.

===Magic Items===
* The ''[[Orcish lead mace]]'' was a powerful, heavy bludgeon.
* ''[[Sunderstone]]'' was made of lead encased in [[steel]].
* [[Tuning fork]]s made of lead were used to [[plane shift]] to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] and the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Salt|Quasi-Elemental Planes of Salt]] and [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Steam|Steam]]. A lead-[[zinc]] tuning fork allowed access to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze]].{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|43}}
