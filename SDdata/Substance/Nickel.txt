'''Nickel''' was a non-precious metal found in the [[Realms]], used for a variety of purposes.

==Properties==
Pure nickel weighed {{SI|555|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot||long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}} Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], nickel required a significant amount of progress on a [[psionicist]]'s part before it could be synthesized through ''[[molecular rearrangement]]''.

==Availability==
* The [[Elemental Store]] of [[Karsus enclave]] sold pure elemental nickel for 6 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}}.
* Deep-sea mineral nodules could contain concentrations of various metals, including nickel.{{Cite dragon/190/Deep Beneath the Waves|17}}
* [[Star metal]] was speculated to be made of nickel and [[iron]].

===Mining & Trade===
Nickel was obtained from the ore [[wikipedia:pentlandite|pentlandite]], a hard, brassy mineral that also contained iron.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}}

* On the [[Sword Coast]], [[Leilon]] mined especially rich deposits of nickel from the nearby [[Sword Mountains]], as well as [[copper]], iron, and [[silver]]. The metals were bought up cheaply by [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] merchants and then exported from the city.{{Cite dungeon/15/The Glass House|38}}<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-05-08 - Sword Mountains Metals}}
* [[King's Reach]] was the smelting center of [[the Vast]], where miners brought ore down from the mountains. The town exported nickel, copper, iron, silver, [[zinc]], and [[gold]].
* [[Cormyr]]ean mines in the [[Storm Horns]] at [[Skull Crag]] provided nickel, as did the mines of [[Hillmarch]] in the [[Gnoll Peaks]].
* In [[Amn]], [[Eshpurta]] was a center of metalworking and forging, and was supplied with nickel, iron, [[electrum]], and [[coal]] from mines in the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]].
* In the [[High Forest]], the [[Star Mounts]] had very pure nickel and iron deposits that were mined by the elves of [[Eaerlann]], but since the fall of the realm they went untouched.
* Around the [[Lake of Steam]] following the [[Second Sundering]], discoveries of nickel, iron, copper, and silver contributed to the growing wealth of the region.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-06 - Post-Second Sundering Lake of Steam}}

==Usages==
* Other metals were alloyed with nickel, including silver. [[Halduthra]] was a peculiar alloy of nickel, [[tin]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and other minerals.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-03-29 - Bloodstone Trade Bar & Halduthra}}
