'''Holy water''' was water blessed by a good deity that could damage [[undead]] and evil [[outsider]]s.

The priests of [[Helm]] called holy water the "Tears of Helm".

==Properties==
Holy water was infused with [[positive energy]], which gave it its properties. Unholy water, in contrast, was imbued with [[negative energy]].

==Applications==
Holy water acted much like acid against undead creatures and evil beings from other [[plane]]s. If contained in a flask, it could be thrown as a grenade weapon against corporeal creatures, or it could be splashed or poured on incorporeal ones. Unholy water instead damaged good outsiders.

Holy water was used in the powerful [[Resurrection (spell)|''resurrection'']] spell, as part of the ceremony to restore life to the dead.

Some users employed an instrument known as an [[aspergillum]] to spray holy water. A larger version of an aspergillum, the [[heavy aspergillum]], was also used as a weapon.

==Production==
To create a flask of holy water required the flask of water, five pounds (2.3 kilograms) of powdered silver, and the ability to [[bless water]]. The process took one minute per flask. The procedure was equivalent for unholy water, except that the water was [[curse water|cursed]] instead.

Temples dedicated to good deities usually sold holy water at cost to those who needed a defense against evil.

==Variations==
[[Elven]] holy water was blessed by the god [[Rillifane Rallathil]] and often used when fighting against [[vampire]]s.

==Notable Users==
* [[Lessa Amyselnar]], a priestess of [[Tymora]].{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}
* [[Brianna Burdun]], a priestess of [[Hiatea]].

==Rumors & Legends==
The plane of [[Celestia]] was said to contain an infinitely large sea of holy water from which [[Mount Celestia]] emerged.
