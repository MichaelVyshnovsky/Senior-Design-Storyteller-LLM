        "mainbody": "'''Hizagkuur''' was an extremely rare metal that was derived from mud-like clumps found deep within the [[Underdark]]. The method to refine the metal from its naturally-occurring [[clay]]-like form was a meticulous process, known to only a select few [[dwarven]] craftspeople.",
        "Description": "In its natural state, Hizagkuur appeared as a light, greenish-gray flecked ore that had the consistency of clay.\n\nWhen finished, this metal had the astonishing effect of reflecting back electricity as well as any and all [[magic]]al energy directed at its surface.",
        "Creation": "The process to refine raw hizagkuur was a complicated and unforgiving process. If a single mistake was made during its creation and forging, it remained as dormant mud. Once the metal was prepared in its molten form, it had to be cast or forged within 24 hours it was rendered inert and was completely useless to a smith. Only a properly worded ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]'' [[spell]] could make a botched mass of hizagkuur usable again.\n\nThe full procedure to refine and forge hizagkuur was a secret held by a small number of master smiths and dwarven elders.",
        "Uses": "* Due to its unique properties, hizagkuur could not be used to craft [[magical item]]s. It was however, perfect for the forging of vital safeguards, such as vault doors, chest seals and [[lock]]s or anything else that held items of great importance.\n* Suits of [[chainmail]] were sometimes forged from hizagkuur.\n* The [[rapier]] ''[[Betrayal]]'', carried by [[Fox-at-Twilight]], was made from hizagkuur."
