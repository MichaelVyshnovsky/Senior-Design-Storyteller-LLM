'''Prismatic ice''' was a mysterious magical substance thought to exhibit intense cold.

The legendary ''[[Calimemnon Crystal]]'' emanated great cold, so some theorized it was encased in or formed of some form of ice, such as exceptionally cold water ice or frozen air. However, the wildest theory put forward was that it might be composed of prismatic ice.
