        "Value and terminology": "Most of Faerûn used \"standard rates of exchange for coinage,\" based on the silver and gold standard, with 1&nbsp;cp worth 1/100&nbsp;gp, 1&nbsp;sp worth 1/10&nbsp;gp, 1&nbsp;ep worth 1/2&nbsp;gp, and 1&nbsp;pp worth 10&nbsp;gp..\n\nElectrum coins adopted various names throughout the Realms.\n* [[Amn]] minted coins called ''centaurs'' or ''decimes''\n* [[Calimport]] minted ''centarches'', ''tazos'', or ''zonths''\n* [[Cormanthyr]] minted ''thammarchs''\n* [[Cormyr]] minted ''blue eyes''\n* [[Sembia]] minted electrum coins called ''harmarks'' or ''electrums''\n** For a time, [[Sembia]] evidently went off the silver and gold standard, and they minted electrum coins called ''blue eyes'', valued at 5&nbsp;gp apiece\n* [[Waterdeep]] minted ''moons'', or ''harbor moons''\n* [[Silverymoon]] minted special coins called ''electrum moons''\n\nThroughout the [[Western Heartlands]], most electrum coins from abroad were called ''blue eyes'' regardless of origin.\n\nThere are two special coins valued more within the city they were minted in:\n* The original shining blue crescent-shaped [[moon (coin)|''electrum moon'']] of [[Silverymoon]], a coin worth 1&nbsp;ep throughout the Realms but twice that within the city itself.\n\n* The ''[[harbor moon]]'' of [[Waterdeep]], a cresent shaped Waterdhavian coin made of platinum, inset with electrum, and punched with a central hole. It was used for bulk transactions, one coin being worth 50&nbsp;gp within the city of Waterdeep anywhere else.\n\nElectrum currency was generally rare and not available in the [[Land of Fate]].",
        "Other uses": "The spell ''[[Khelben]]'s warding whip'' used a pinch of powdered electrum as a material component.\n\nThe spell ''[[Leomund secret chest]]'' could use a chest fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver with fittings of electrum or silver.\n\nMagical [[morning star]]s known as ''[[storm star]]''s were crafted from electrum-plated steel. They could unleash a ''[[chain lightning]]'' effect.\n\nAn electrum mounting allowed [[witherite]] to be worn as a protection to necromantic attacks.<ref>\n\nTwo notable tomes—''The [[Chambeeleon]]'' and ''The [[Tome of the Unicorn]]''—had electrum pages, with the latter also having electrum covers.\n\nIf one of the twisted bands of a ''[[shoonring]]'' was made of electrum, this usually indicated that the ring contained multiple powers and enhanced the effects of the magics involved."
