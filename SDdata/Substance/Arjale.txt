Arjale was a metal only found in the Nine Hells, and one of the component of the alloy known as dajavva. Seldom found outside the infernal planes, it reached very high prices when sold on the Prime Material plane.
By itself, arjale was a lightweight metal easy to polish and to sharpen into razor-like blades.
By alloying arjale with iron, smiths were able to create a material known as dajavva. Light green-gray in color, it was particularly flexible, to the point that Molochs whip was crafted using this alloy.
Arjale could also be alloyed with tantulhor and silver to create an extremely durable yet pliable metal, of untarnished silvery color with flecks of green.
Arjale was used in the creation of magic items such as the demonshields of the Shoon Imperium. It was also used to create the talisman of many devils such as Agares, Asmodeus, Barbatos and Buer.
Arjale was mined by nupperibos and spinagons in Phlegethos They could also be found in Malbolge and Maladomini, where it was less abundant.
