'''''Mercury''''', often called '''''quicksilver''''', was a heavy, white-silver metal refined from [[cinnabar]].

==History==
[[File:Cinnabar Sand.png|thumb|200px|''Raw cinnabar.'']]
The age-old [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[Dekanter|Mines of Dekanter]] were rich in mercury, as well as other metals, and the steady supply met the Netherese arcanists' demands. After the fall of Netheril, the mines became overrun by [[Dekanter goblin|goblin]]s but still had a rich abundance of metal.

A companionless [[duergar]] once believed he had come across a whole pool of mercury, but it actually turned out to be an [[Abyss]]al ''[[gate]]''. After touching the otherworldly gate, he fell under the control of [[Orcus]], who used him to conquer [[Deepearth]].

==Usages==

The [[divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] ''[[flame shield]]'' required a drop of mercury as one of its [[material component]]s. The extremely powerful [[arcane]] spell ''[[chain contingency]]'' needed 500 [[gp]] worth of quicksilver in order to be cast. Other arcane spells, such as ''[[Tenser's floating disk]]'' and ''[[maddening darkness]]'' only required a drop of the substance.

According to the [[imp]] [[Cespenar]], liquid mercury could be used to enhance the legendary [[Angurvadal]] sword known as the ''[[Stream of Anguish]]''.

==Trivia==
Some [[dragon]]s, known as [[mercury dragon]]s, had the ability to turn into liquid quicksilver, a form that allowed them to easily pass through difficult terrain.

The [[portal]] between the [[gate-town]] of [[Ecstasy]] and [[Elysium]] was a pool of mercury.{{Cite dragon/351/The Gatetown of Ecstasy|51}}
