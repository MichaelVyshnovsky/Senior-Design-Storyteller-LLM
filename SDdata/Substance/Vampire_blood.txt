Vampire blood or vampiric blood, also known as vampire ichor and referred to among some vampires as kin-nectar, was blood that flowed through the bodies of vampires.
Vampire blood typically had the same rich, red coloration as the blood of most living creatures. However, when viewed under transmitted light, such as in a vial held under a light,
Unlike the blood of living creatures, this blood absorbed nothing from the lungs of vampires as they ceased to require oxygen in their undead state. This also meant that any toxic chemicals within inhaled gas wouldnt crossover into the bloodstream. Once blood was extracted from the body of a vampire it could potentially exhibit one of a myriad of different properties. It was considered impossible to predict what property a vampires blood might have prior to extraction.
Some vampire blood was noted to be highly caustic, some would cause any creature that came into contact with it to fall under the sway of the vampire similar to charm person, and some was noted as violently bursting into flames upon exposure to sunlight.
In the Domains of Dread, it was observed that the moment a vampire was slain any samples of their blood would fall inert. Often times these samples would become corrupted and rancid within mere seconds of the host vampires death. However, on Toril, this was not the case, as blood could be obtained from slaying vampires without fear of it being rendered inert.
* Vampires were not only capable of obtaining sustenance from kin-nectar, but the substance was found to be more filling than the blood of mortals. However, most eschewed consuming the substance, far preferring the taste of demihuman and human blood.
* Drinking kin-nectar had two unique necrological effects on both parties. One was the creation of an intimate mental link between the two vampires, allowing them to telepathically communicate with each other. This telepathy was unlimited in range, functioned only so long as the two were on the same plane of existence, and lasted for around one to three hours. The second effect was that the imbiber of the blood had significant control over the vampire they had fed from, enabling them to issue telepathic orders that had to be obeyed, though within reason. These effects served as another reason for why most vampires eschewed consuming kin-nectar, as they found such telepathic links to be distasteful and the secondary effect to be downright dangerous for the one fed upon.Disclaimer Like many of the observations made by Rudolph Van Richten, it is uncertain how much of this information is applicable to vampires outside of the Domains of Dread.
* Vampire spawn could become full vampires by feeding upon the kin-nectar of their master.
* Vampire blood, in a certain complaint of other monster fluids, such as trolls, could be magically transferred into a humanoid through necromantic rituals to instill them with regenerative abilities.
