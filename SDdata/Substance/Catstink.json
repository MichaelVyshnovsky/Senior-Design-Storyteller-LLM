        "mainbody": "'''Catstink''' was a type of [[alchemical]] compound used by [[thieves]] to throw off the scent of [[dog]]s or any creature that may be tracking them.",
        "Properties": "Catstink was a liquid compound with a thick consistency and a brown-yellow hue. It had a particularly strong odor, specially designed to agitate the senses of dogs, that could be picked up by dogs as far away as {{SI|200|yard|long=yes}} or even {{SI|0.5|mile|long=yes}} if they were downwind of it. Any dog who caught a whiff of this compound, no matter how highly trained they were, would forgo all other commands as they frantically tried to search for the \"[[cat]]\" they were smelling.\n\nOnce thrown down, the odor of catstink would persist for a duration of 10 minutes.",
        "Applications": "This compound was used among thieves to throw off the scent of creatures that were tracking them, primarily dogs, or to distract guard dogs.",
        "Production": "Creating this compound required [[alchemical]]s to blend liquids obtained from various parts of cats with a select few secret ingredients.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Vanet Twingvine]], an [[elf]] thief that operated in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Living City: Misti's Moonlight Pawnshop|16}}"
