        "mainbody": "'''Titansteel''', sometimes known as '''relic iron''', was a worked and surface-hardened [[alloy]] of [[iron]] known to be both stronger and lighter than common [[steel]].",
        "Properties": "Titansteel was half the weight of regular steel, and was both harder and more resistant to corrosion.",
        "Applications": "[[File:Titansteel plate.webp|thumb]][[File:Titansteel rings.webp|thumb|''Titansteel plates and rings.'']]\nTitansteel could be used to fashion [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], [[shield]]s, and other [[metal]] items such as [[nail]]s and [[Bolt (fastener)|bolts]]. [[Chainmail]] made of titansteel was deceptively strong for how lightweight it was.\n\nAs a commodity, titansteel was very expensive. It was most commonly traded in [[ingot]]s, plates, and rings.",
        "History": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ingots of ancient titansteel found throughout the [[North]] were more commonly referred to as \"relic iron\", and were used to produce modern titansteel. Such production methods often involved the use of [[gem]]s in the smithing process, such as [[molybdenum]] or [[sphene]].\n\nDuring the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} buyers in [[Port Nyanzaru]] became interested in importing titansteel weapons and armor. The guard captain [[Uponga Naodha]] recognized that metal armor was both desirable to protect his men, but heavy and cumbersome in the [[Chult]]an heat. Meanwhile, [[Silaha Mnunzi]] sought [[axe]]s, [[claymore]]s, and [[lance]]s of titansteel on behalf of the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Ekene-Afa]], who controlled the sale of weapons in the city."
