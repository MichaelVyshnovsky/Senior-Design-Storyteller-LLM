        "Availability": "The [[Elemental Store]] of the [[Karsus Enclave]] sold pure elemental molybdenum for 10 [[gp]] per ounce.",
        "Usages": "[[File:Ship Bolts.png|thumb|''An alloyed bolt.'']]\nMolybdenum was prized for its uses in alloys. It was alloyed with [[adamantine]], [[steel]], and [[titansteel]] to make strong and durable [[Bolt (fastener)|bolt]], [[rivet]]s, [[nail]]s, [[wire]], and blades. It improved the weldability of adamantine, and improved the lamination of steel as well as its resistance to rust and corrosion."
