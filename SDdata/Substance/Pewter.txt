'''Pewter''' was a useful alloyed metal produced and worked on [[Toril]].

==Properties==
Pewter typically weighed {{SI|454|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot||long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}} It was mostly unaffected by the corrosion of salt water, but contact with [[iron]] while submerged caused it to dissolve.{{Cite dragon/250/Sunken Fortunes|65}}

==Usages==
* Pewter was used to make steins, [[mug]]s, and tankards, a more expensive option than [[brass]] but cheaper than [[silver]].
* A pewter [[tuning fork]] could be used to [[plane shift]] to the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]].{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|43}}
* [[Pewter golem]]s were a kind of [[golem]].
* [[Dung]]-carters collected metal scraps from the street to trade to metalsmiths, selling pewter, [[copper]], and brass for 4 cp per pound.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Stench Carts}}

==History==
[[Tasseldale]] had a high population of pewtersmiths and tinsmiths. Tin and other metals were imported from [[Sembia]] and [[Archendale]], then the finished crafts were exported, often to [[Arabel]]. The [[Tasselway Coster]] ran caravans that specialized in tin and pewter trade goods, among others.

[[Velarstown Silver and Jewelry]] in [[Harrowdale]] traded in pewterware, gems, and other fine metalwork.

Pewter goods were made in and exported from [[Saerloon]] in Sembia.
