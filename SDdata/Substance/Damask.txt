'''Damask''' was a type of luxury fabric in the Realms that had a pattern formed by weaving. It was usually made from either cotton or [[linen]].

==History==
In ancient times the empire of [[Raumathar]] used damask, having arras ([[tapestries]]) made of the fabric in their capital of [[Winterkeep]].

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], damask was among the many fine fabrics that one could be found used for clothing in [[Selgaunt]] and [[Waterdeep]]. 

In [[Baldur's Gate]] in the [[1482 DR]], the city's [[Council of Four]] with concurrence of the [[Parliament of Peers]] reinstated old sumptuary laws that made it illegal for anyone but the [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar]] to wear attire made of damask.
