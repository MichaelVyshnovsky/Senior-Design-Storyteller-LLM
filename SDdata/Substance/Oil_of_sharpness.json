        "mainbody": "Oil of sharpness, sometimes called oil of honing,\nOil of sharpness appeared as a gelatinous substance, speckled with shards of silver. Some believed that the oil was derived from the echoes of old battles.\nWhen applied, oil of sharpness granted weapons powers akin to those provided by the enchantment process. The effect lasted anywhere from a matter of minutes, up to an hours time.\nOne flask of oil allowed for between three to five applications. Depending on the quality of the formulation, an application granted a weapon anywhere from a +1 to +6 enhancement.\nDuring the early Era of Upheaval, a single flask of oil of sharpness ranged in price from 4,000 to 24,000 gp. As of the late 15 century DR, enough oil for a single application cost a mere 10 gp.\n* Arron, the halfling merchant who set up shop at the Emerald Grove.\n* Ugomech, a Thayan man and the long-lost love of the Red Wizard Lamantala."
