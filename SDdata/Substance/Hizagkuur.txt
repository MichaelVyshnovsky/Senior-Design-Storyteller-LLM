Hizagkuur was an extremely rare metal that was derived from mud-like clumps found deep within the Underdark. The method to refine the metal from its naturally-occurring clay-like form was a meticulous process, known to only a select few dwarven craftspeople.
In its natural state, Hizagkuur appeared as a light, greenish-gray flecked ore that had the consistency of clay.
When finished, this metal had the astonishing effect of reflecting back electricity as well as any and all magical energy directed at its surface.
The process to refine raw hizagkuur was a complicated and unforgiving process. If a single mistake was made during its creation and forging, it remained as dormant mud. Once the metal was prepared in its molten form, it had to be cast or forged within 24 hours it was rendered inert and was completely useless to a smith. Only a properly worded wish or limited wish spell could make a botched mass of hizagkuur usable again.
The full procedure to refine and forge hizagkuur was a secret held by a small number of master smiths and dwarven elders.
* Due to its unique properties, hizagkuur could not be used to craft magical items. It was however, perfect for the forging of vital safeguards, such as vault doors, chest seals and locks or anything else that held items of great importance.
* Suits of chainmail were sometimes forged from hizagkuur.
* The rapier Betrayal, carried by Fox-at-Twilight, was made from hizagkuur.
