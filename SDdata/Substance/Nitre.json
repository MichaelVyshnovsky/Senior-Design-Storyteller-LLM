        "mainbody": "Nitre, also known as saltpeter, was a common form of salt in the Realms.\nThis substance could be burned, but on Toril it would not combust.\n* Mount Hotenow.\n* Many within the Realms used nitre for curing meats.\n* Nitre was sometimes used in the distillation of caustic liquids. For instance, it could be distilled with alum and oil of vitriol to create the substance aqua fortis. It could also be distilled with aqua fortis and sal ammoniac to create aqua regia.\n* This substance could be mixed with charcoal and sulfur to create a substance known as gunpowder.\n* The alchemist Surero claimed to use a combination of 75% sulfur, 10% saltpeter and 15% charcoal mixed together in sacks to create the alchemical substance smokepowder.It should be noted though that Ed Greenwood stated in one [https//web.archive.org/web/20210517004301/https//twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953 tweet] that smokepowder had completely different ingredients from gunpowder.
