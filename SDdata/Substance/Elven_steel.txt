Elven steel was a metal produced by the elves of the Realms, used to forge bladed weapons and armor.
Elven steel was just as strong as the finest steel produced by other folk of the Realms, but with half the weight. It held the reputation of piercing through armor with ease.
Armor formed from elven steel could not be readily purchased by many, but was sometimes offered as a gift to non-elves.
Weapons wielded by the Tomb Guard of Evereska were forged from elven steel.
