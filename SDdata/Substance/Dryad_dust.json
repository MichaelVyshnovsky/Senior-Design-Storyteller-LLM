        "mainbody": "Dryad dust was a grey toxic powder in the post-Spellplague era that induced a form of insanity when ingested.It is never stated within the game Daggerdale what, if any, relation the powder had to actual dryads.\nIngestion of dryad dust induced a violent mad frenzy in creatures, one in which they were unable to discern friends from foes and would attack anyone that came near them.How long this insanity lasted for, whether it was a temporary or permanent condition, was never stated.\nIn the , Garbo Silvertongue, a dwarf living within the settlement of Granstone in the mines of Tethyamar grew impatient and fed up with the progress being made towards the dwarves reclaiming their ancestral home of Tethyamar. Garbo decided to betray his people to Rezlus, a Zhent wizard who was amassing an army to conquer Daggerdale and the greater Dalelands region and who was stationed in a tower above the mines, atop the Desertsmouth Mountains. In return for this betrayal, Rezlus promised Garbo dominion over the mines of Tethyamar.\nGarbo Silvertongue went on to poison some of Granstones water supply with dryad dust, driving dwarves in the eastern work camp into a frenzy that resulted in lots of damage to the surrounding area. These were initially mistaken by inhabitants as being some sort of curse afflicting their people. Garbo then planted the dryad dust within a satchel belonging to one of the settlements leaders, Master Paxton, in order to frame him.\nAround this time, a party of four Daggerdalesmen adventurers were traveling through the mines of Tethyamar to defeat Rezlus. Along the way, they traveled through Granstone and slew many of the dwarves that had been driven mad by dryad dust. They then consulted with Granstones other leader, Master Ayer, who revealed his discovery of dryad dust being involved. Ayer then ordered the adventurers to destroy Granstones reserves of barreled water before all the dwarves succumbed to madness and asked them to bring him any package that they might suspect to be holding the powder. Fighting through more crazed dwarves and Zhent-allied forces along the way, they eventually recovered a satchel and presented it to Master Ayer, discovering that it belonged to Master Paxton. Ayer was skeptical that Paxton would be responsible, but had no time to discuss the matter with him as a horde of Zhent-allied goblins launched an assault upon Granstone and captured Ayer.\nWhile caged, Ayer was confronted by Garbo, who admitted his responsibility for the dryad dust and further stated that he was planning kill the other dwarves by poisoning the rest of Granstones water reserves with the powder. However, before Garbo could carry out this plan Ayer was rescued by the four Daggerdalesmen and informed them of everything."
