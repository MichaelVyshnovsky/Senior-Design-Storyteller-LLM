Seldom found outside the infernal planes, it reached very high prices when sold on the Prime Material plane.\nBy itself, tantulhor was almost unbreakable. Weapons forged from this metal could cut about anything, except stone.\nTantulhor could be alloyed with arjale and silver to create an extremely durable yet pliable metal, of untarnished silvery color with flecks of green.\nTantulhor was used in the creation of magic items such as the demonshields of the Shoon Imperium or the rod of Dispater. It was also used to create the talisman of many devils such as Zagan or the hamatulas.\nTantulhor was mined by nupperibos and spinagons in Phlegethos They could also be found in Malbolge and Maladomini, where it was less abundant."
