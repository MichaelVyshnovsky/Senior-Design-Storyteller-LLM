        "mainbody": "Illithium was a rare and expensive ore and a type of alloy sometimes available for purchase from the markets of Athkatla in Amn.\nIllithium ore was renowned for its luster and the unique property of never becoming soiled. In its pure form, illithium was exceedingly rare and next to impossible to find in huge quantities. In some usages, illithium was made into an alloy.\nIllithium could be used to improve a mace of disruption, strengthening its magics and making it more deadly to the undead. In the late 14 century DR, such work was performed by Cromwell, a blacksmith from Athkatla in Amn.\nIn the , the famed Athkatlan sculptor Sir Sarles of the Jysstev Estate sought  of pure illithium ore to work on a piece commissioned by the Church of Helm. The only ore merchant in Athkatla at the time who occasionally had access to the elusive material was Jerlia, who ran her business from the Waukeens Promenade. Despite Sir Sarless demands, Jerlia could only get her hands on up to  of illithium ore per season. She also revealed that her source of the substance was a duergar merchant, Unger Hilldark, operating out of the Copper Coronet. Coincidentally, a serial killer named Neb stole a huge shipment of illithium from the duergar trader around the same time.\nIt is unknown if Sir Sarles was able to finish his commission. There were several possible outcomes of the events. Sarles may have been presented with a significantly less valuable illithium alloy instead, allowing him to finish the commission without realizing the metals true nature, unless the fake illithium angered the sculptor and made him leave Athkatla in fury. Alternatively, true illithium couldve been retrieved from Neb and used to sculpt the Church of Helms commission."
