Talcum was a fine white powdered substance with several uses.
*In the Blade Kingdoms, talcum powder was used as a tool against thieves and spellcasters. The powder was used to dust floors in high-security locations, such as the Palace of Manniccis in the city-state of Sumbria. Talcum made it extremely challenging for sneak thieves and creatures under the effects of the invisibility spells to move undetected. The powder was often used alongside caltrops and mines.
*Apart from security purposes, talcum powder was one of the material components for the see invisibility spell.
