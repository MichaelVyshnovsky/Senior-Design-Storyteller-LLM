'''Coal''' was a form of fossilized [[carbon]]-rich mineral used as a fuel, similar to [[coke]] and [[charcoal]] in function, and related to [[petroleum]] in origin.

==Properties==
The weight of coal varied on the type, usually between {{SI|87|pound|k|long=yes}} to {{SI|112|pound|k|long=yes}} per {{SI|1|cubic foot|l|long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|7}}

==Availability==

* [[Aurora's Emporium]] supplied chunks of anthracite coal for 1 [[gp]] per pound, and bituminous coal for 1 gp per 20 pounds.
* Coal was infrequently found and used on the surface of [[Toril]], with only shallow surface deposits mined. It was much more commonly mined by [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s of the [[Underdark]], who regularly used coal for forging and cooking.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/08-01 - Petroleum Oil in the Realms}}
* Coal was mined in large quantities from the rural lands north of [[Arabel]] using bell pits, including [[Gnoll Pass]].
* Coal and many other minerals were exported from [[Zhentil Keep]].
* The precious stone [[jet]] was an uncommon variant of bituminous coal.

==Usage==
[[File:Coal item BG2.png|thumb|''This is a pile of coal.'']]
* Coal was used to heat furnaces for the working of metals. Anthracite coal would ideally be used to fuel non-vented flames such as [[brazier]]s, while bituminous coal needed to be ventilated to burn properly. Both varieties of coal were needed to keep a [[wizard]]'s laboratory operational.
* Anthracite coal was used to fuel ovens and kilns, which used bellows to pump air in. With enough pumping, such a kiln could reach the temperatures needed to fire bisque [[clay]] and melt low-quality [[steel]].
* Common forges could be fuelled by anthracite or bituminous coal, reaching temperatures to melt [[iron]], steel, [[silver]], and [[gold]].
* The inventor [[Nadul DaRoni]] tested a self-propelled [[furnace wagon]] fuelled with coal. It consumed 25 pounds of coal per hour, and had only a small chance of spontaneously exploding (and one confirmed death).
* Carefully-applied coal dust was used in disguise kits and [[makeup]] kits.
* [[Coal golem]]s were made from animated burning coal.{{Cite web/Monster Mayhem/Coal Golem}}
* ''[[Trimia's catalogue of Outer Plane artifacts]]'' could manifest lumps of blood-red coal that could transport users to [[Avernus]] in the [[Nine Hells]].
* The [[Planar Sphere]] of the wizard [[Lavok Corthala]] had a [[golem]] laboratory powered by magical coal furnaces.
* ''[[Darkness]]'' could be cast using a chunk of coal.

==Other==

* When handling hot coals, [[tongs]] were recommended.
* Coal [[shovel]]s were specially made to handle large amounts of coal.
