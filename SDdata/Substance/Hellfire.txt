Hellfire was a kind of fire. It glowed white and was very hot. The temperature hellfire reached exceeded that of any other form of fire. It was so high that protection against heat, including complete immunity, was worthless against it. Hellfires destructive capabilities extended to objects too. No matter how the object in question was protected, no matter how well it could withstand heat, hellfire simply destroyed it.
One branch of warlocks that could use hellfire regardless of their ethical and moral outlook were the hellfire warlocks. They could enhance their magical abilities with hellfire. However, channeling hellfire was dangerous to the physical health of the user and could kill him or her with overuse.
Hellfire could be created by using the plane of Baator as a direct source of energy.
