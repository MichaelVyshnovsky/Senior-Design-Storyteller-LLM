        "mainbody": "'''Hardflow''', or '''concrete''', was a composite construction material used in the [[Realms]] alongside [[mortar]], [[cement]], and [[asphalt]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/06-15 - Marsember Defenses}}",
        "Availability": "While the base stone for hardflow was supplied by [[dwarf|dwarves]] from the crushed-up rubble of their mining excavation projects, it was usually processed by [[human]] [[wizard]]s who used [[magic]]al artifice to make the finished product. Concrete was most often handled and installed by dwarven architects, and was also commonly used by urban [[halfling]], [[gnome]], and human builders as well. It was sometimes used for the construction of large, solid forms such as floors and drains, but was most often used for sealing gaps.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-10-21 - Concrete and Cement}}\n\nConcrete and similar products were very common in [[Lantan]], which had also developed reinforced concrete. The recipes and methods involved in these materials were often closely-held family secrets for the Lantanna, as it was for other bespoke materials such as [[plastic]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-03-01 - Lantan in the 15th Century DR}}",
        "Notable Examples": "* The city walls of [[Marsember]] had large outward-facing storm drains made of concrete.\n* The [[Palace of Governance]] in [[Zazesspur]] had concrete front steps.\n* The colonial outpost fortresses of the [[City of Brass]] were made from a range of durable materials, including a kind of volcanic concrete.",
        "Magic": "* ''[[Transmute stone to sand]]'', ''[[clearstone]]'', and similar spells had no effect upon concrete, as it was sufficiently intermixed with other materials to no longer resemble natural stone."
