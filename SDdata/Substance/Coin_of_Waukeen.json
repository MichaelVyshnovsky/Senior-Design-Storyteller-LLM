        "Description": "These coins bore the holy symbol of Waukeen.  Multiple coins within shining, yellow coin purses manifested upon the bodies of powerful slain monsters, typically when such a death helped to protect merchants and trade routes.",
        "Price": "[[File:Gilded Waukeenar Equipment.png|thumb|250px|''A rack holding some gilded Waukeenar equipment next to some bars of gold. From left to right: [[bow]], [[holy symbol]], [[orb]], [[greatsword]], [[dagger]], [[longsword]], and [[shield]].'']]\nThe exact economic value of these coins was uncertain, but they could often be traded to devout merchants of Waukeen in return for special gilded equipment. These included [[bow]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[greatsword]]s, [[holy symbol]]s, [[longsword]]s, [[mace]]s, [[orb]]s, ''[[pact blade]]s'', and [[shield]]s. In rarer cases, they could receive [[cloak]]s or [[robe]]s sewed with golden thread, a gold crown, or even the notable [[golden pantaloons]].",
        "History": "During the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of [[adventurer]]s around [[Neverwinter]] and across the greater [[Sword Coast]] encountered coin purses containing coins of Waukeen and gold [[dye]]. Adventurers in Neverwinter often traded their coins to a merchant that hung around the [[Moonstone Mask]]. A select few adventurers were noted as receiving from the merchant a miniature, domesticated [[mimic]] that looked like a red, gilded strongbox."
