Iron was a common metal found across Faerûn and beyond as mineral sand, various ores, and pure native iron. limonite, magnetite, pyrite, and siderite. All of them were considered hard minerals and therefore work-intensive to extract by miners.
Iron could be found by how it stained soil and water, giving a distinctive color and taste.
* The massive Lake of Steam had unique properties from dissolved iron and other minerals.
* The soil around Redspring was rich in iron, giving the spring water a bloody color and taste.
* The Umber Marshes were tinted their unique color by veins of iron beneath them.
* The city of Solon had red geothermal hot springs, infused by rich iron veins.
The iron smelter of Black Dwarf Mine.
Iron ore was refined by laborious and filthy efforts at a bloomery furnace. One method involved dumping a layer of raw ore into a vertical furnace fed by forcefully pumped air, followed by a layer of limestone flux and then fuel such as charcoal, coal, or coke, then repeated until its own weight threatened to crush the burning coals. The limestone would bind with the non-metallic substance of the ore, separating from the iron into glassy slag tailings. As the ore melted, it would run to the bottom of the furnace and flow out into a crucible called the "hearth" where the slag would separate and float to the top, allowing it to be raked off and separated from the pure iron. The liquid iron was then poured into a series of channels dug into sand, the main "sow" channel lined with numerous "pig" cavities. After the sow and pigs solidified, they were broken apart with hammers and pulled out with hooks, clearing the channels for future castings. Alternatively, the iron could be poured into clay moulds that made specific products such as pots and pans, or into a clay-lined casting ladle that could dispense iron into smaller, more delicate project moulds.
The pig iron would then be further processed into wrought iron, the common form of worked iron. In this process the pig iron was purified of the excess carbon in charcoal fireboxes, making it more malleable and resilient.
Gracklstugh, the City of Blades, never stopped forging.
* The Frozenfar was famously rich in all manner of mineral wealth, including iron. The largest known iron deposit in Faerûn lay below Ironmaster, a dwarven settlement dedicated to the mining and smelting of iron, refined into pots, pans, and forge bars that were then exported through Fireshear and Mirabar. In the Underdark nearby, the dwarven city of Hammerkeep in the Underdark possessed mines of pure native iron, though long lost to drow and derro.
* The Silver Marches were rich in minerals, especially iron, gold, silver, and copper. On the edge of the Evermoors, natural clefts near Nesmé yielded much easily-accessible iron, leading to the town having a dedicated ironworking industry. The village of Auvandell near Sundabar supplied the city with iron, copper, and lead, and the folk of Deadsnows mined iron, copper, and silver from the nearby Nether Mountains. To the north, the orcs of Dark Arrow Keep mined plentiful iron from deeper in the Spine of the World mountains.
* In the Northdark, the duergar city of Gracklstugh processed huge amounts of iron, using Themberchauds fiery breath to heat their forges. Elsewhere in the Northdark, the earth node Nuur Throth was a gigantic black iron lode.
* The Star Mounts in the High Forest had remarkably pure iron and nickel deposits that were mined by the elves of Eaerlann, but since the fall of the realm it went untouched.
* On the Sword Coast, Leilon mined iron, copper, nickel, and silver from the Sword Mountains. The metals were bought at a cheap price by Waterdhavian merchants who then exported it from the city.
* Beneath Waterdeep in the Deep Mines of Undermountain, the duergar mined mithral and iron, the latest group led by prince Valtagar Steelshadow. A few miles west of Waterdeep, the Black Dwarf Mine exploited a very pure vein of iron ore, with Aldurghen Stormhammer and his crew mining and forging the metal.
* The granite Serpent Hills had rich deposits of iron, silver, salt, and marble.The Black Dwarf Mine dwarves forging iron.
* In the Moonshae Isles, Moray exported iron ore, while Callidyrr was a prominent center of iron mining and ironworking. One of the minining settlements in the Fairheight Range was Blackstone, source of some of the highest-quality iron in Faerûn. Nearby, the Northlander settlement of Gnarhelm also mined the Range.
* In Amn, the mines of Nashkel supplied iron to the entire region. Eshpurta was a center of metalworking and forged a great deal of iron, and was supplied by nearby iron and nickel mines in the Troll Mountains. The Gulf of Storms in the same mountains was a crystal- and iron-studded cleft that seemed to attract lightning bolts, and was actually a temple of Talos.
* In the desert of Anauroch, Aerithaes Rest in the Plain of Standing Stones had surface iron deposits that could be easily harvested with a hammer.
* Orc tribes mined iron in the Goblin Marches and Stonelands, using it to supply their own weapons and armor.
* Cormyrean mines in the Storm Horns at Old Axe and Skull Crag provided good amounts of iron.
* The Dalelands were generally poor in iron and other metals. Tasseldale harvested a small amount of iron ore from the depths of Glaun Bog, discovered by the human blacksmith Glaun.
* The hills south of the Tangled Forest in the Cormanthor had deposits of iron that supported the unorthodox diets of introduced aurumvorax.
* On the Moonsea, Mulmaster was the largest single exporter of iron, with the city perpetually shadowed by the foundry smoke. Nearby Point Iron was a fair iron mine, though it was seized by duergar from below. Further west, Ironfang Keep sat atop and was surrounded by rich iron deposits, though the mystery and danger of the site kept any prospectors away.
* The Galena Mountains in northeast Faerûn were rich in iron ore, and humans and dwarves established mining communities there. Iron ore was exported from nearby Glister, along with silver and copper.
* Chult had great mineral wealth, with iron among it. The dwarves of Hrakhamar mined and worked iron and adamantine from beneath the Kobold Mountains.
* Lapaliiya was poor in iron and was a great importer of it. One of the few mines was near the metalworking city of Lhazantal, the City of Smiths.
* In the Hazur Mountains, scattered iron and gold mines were operated by Tashalaran humans and Thindolese gold dwarves, and also served as passages to the Burning Rift in the Underdark.
* The dwarves of the Great Rift mined and worked a great deal of metals, with ironworking centered at Eartheart. The richest mines were found at Glitterdelve, where they found iron, silver, gold, copper, and lead, and lesser mines at Rimmator that produced iron, copper, and tin.A typical file made of iron.
* Shield dwarves were considered the masters of iron and steelworking above all other peoples.
* Steel was made by alloying iron with carbon, making a material that was stronger and kept a keener edge.
* Iron was commonly used for making simple, everyday items and tools such as caltrops, crowbars, hammers, pots, files, nails, hinges, locks, buckets, drills, chains, and manacles.
* Iron was the basic material used to make countless forms of weaponry and armor, though local circumstances affected how widely it was used. In much of Kara-Tur, the warmer, more humid climate made the use of heavy metal armor less common than in Faerûn. In Chult, iron and steel was rare but prized for weapons, while metal armor was completely unsuited for the tropical climate.
* Iron was used to make strong, resilient furnishings and constructions found in homes, castles, and dungeons. Timbers and stonework could be reinforced with iron, and doors, grates, and portcullises could be made partly or wholly of iron. Decorative yet functional elements such as railings and fences were also commonly made of iron.
* Particularly dark-colored iron was used in the construction of shoonrings that had combat or defensive properties.280px|Rust monsters werent malevolent, just hungry.
* Rust monsters could smell metal from long distances, and happily pursued such meals with enthusiasm even if they were carried or worn. Preferring iron or steel over others, a touch of its wiggling antennae caused metal to corrode and fall to pieces, followed by dining. Even magical creations such as magical weapons, armor, and iron golems were reduced to scraps by their touch.
* Iron dragons were the most powerful of the ferrous dragons. They hoarded and ate iron ore, the substance necessary for their reproduction.
* The Maraloi of northern Kara-Tur were poisoned by the touch of iron, and used bronze and stone instead. Certain human tribes in the region were suspected to have Maraloi ancestry due to their apparent refusal to use iron.
* Large iron deposits could interfere with location-finding spells.
* The rusting grasp spell corroded and destroyed iron and iron alloys.
* Thaolet was a dwarven-made oil that destroyed rust and protected iron from corrosion.
* Planetoid shards (the destroyed fragments of planets in Wildspace) often had a sharp end made of nickel or iron.
The Sarrukh were among the first to forge iron and steel, having mastered the metallurgy as their civilization rose in Okoth around , and used it to dominate the primitive humanoids of Faerûn.
The Second Age of Calimshan from  to  saw their armies marching forth to conquer surrounding lands, using a mix of iron and bronze weapons and armor.
In ancient Netheril, Kozah was depicted in art as holding three staves, made of the first iron forged, the first silver forged, and the first tree felled.
In , Netheril experienced an economic boom with the discovery of the rich mines of Dekanter, obtaining vast amounts of iron, platinum, mercury, silver, and gold. As the mines were worked out, the empty tunnels were used for magical research and secure storage. Despite their wealth and knowledge, a focus on magical enhancement over metallurgical techniques meant that the civilization made little progress, and advanced ironworking and steelmaking was never achieved.
The Netherese city of Scourge suffered from a strange environmental condition, as the salty wind blowing off the Narrow Sea rusted metal at an extraordinary rate, including magical items. The land around the city was even home to inordinate amounts of rust monsters. In , the city came under attack from Shining Tooth clan goblins, whose assault was shattered in part due to their metal weapons breaking.
The Netherese successor kingdom of Anauria was able to supply itself with iron and tin, but didnt have any copper and zinc.
Before the existence of Tethyr, dwarves delved around what would become Velen, finding a little iron ore but not enough to justify settlement.
Keczulla in Amn was founded in 575 DR by the Kczull family during a gold rush that also found iron deposits there. By 755 DR, the mines were played out and the settlement was abandoned.
Citadel Adbar had massive iron spikes atop it that threatened to impale any large, flying attackers (such as dragons) that attempted to land on it.
From about 1108 DR, the settlement of Dulgund mined iron on Drelvros in the Nelanther Isles. Founded by Dulgund Greatanvil, he and his followers were drowned when a fierce winter storm washed over the island in 1163 DR. The Dungeons of Torment were based in a failed iron mine on the same island.

The Mountain of Iron in Miyama Province of Kozakura was a rich source of iron in the otherwise metal-poor region. Around , the mines were tapped out and closed, with the mining settlements such as Chizu facing abandonment.
The town of Llorkh grew up around shallow iron and silver mines in the Greypeak Mountains. These mines soon ran out and the town began shrinking, with the Zhentarim appearing to take over the dying settlement shortly after.
In 1368 DR, the Iron Throne attempted to seize control of the iron trade on the Sword Coast by sending agents to sabotage the Nashkel iron mine. They also hired the Chill and Blacktalons mercenaries to disrupt overland caravan trade, and secretly exploited the secret Cloak Wood mine to create their own supply of iron.
