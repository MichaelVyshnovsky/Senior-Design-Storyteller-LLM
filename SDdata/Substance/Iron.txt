Pure iron weighed  per , while impure forms tended to weigh a little less. Iron had a relatively high melting point ranging from  to  depending on the impurities present, but could still be warped or melted by the heat flash of fireball and lightning bolt spells. Prior to the Time of Troubles, iron required a significant amount of progress on a psionicists part before it could be synthesized through molecular rearrangement.
Iron was found in several notable forms
* Pig iron was the raw, freshly-made product of smelting. It was extremely hard and brittle due to its high carbon content, and required further work to make the wrought iron that was the commonly-used form.
* Cold iron was a peculiar form of iron found deep underground. If carefully forged at low temperatures, it could be devastatingly deadly against fey and demons.
* Star metal, or meteoric iron, was usually made of iron and other metals in a strong natural alloy.
* Luspeel, or lodestone, was a concentration of magnetite iron ore that possessed magnetic properties that affected nearby metal objects in a non-magical manner.
* Pyrite was a notable form of iron ore that closely resembled raw gold, and caused prospectors great frustration.
Metals that resembled iron but were still distinctly different substances could also be found
* Infernal iron was found in the Nine Hells.
* Blackiron was a strong, dark metal that resembled iron.
* Titansteel was a light, resilient metal also known as relic iron.
Auroras Emporium sold iron through its catalogue in varying forms for use as magical reagents, such as strips, chunks, powders, and cubes, as well as pyrite. Ordinary iron for forging could be bought in 1 lb bars for 5 cp, and larger 10 lb ingots for 4 sp. The Emporium also offered pre-made  square sheets (5 cp),  of wire (5 cp), and  by  strips (4 cp) that could be used for a variety of purposes.
In , the Elemental Store of Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental iron for 6 gp per ounce.
Iron ore was often conveyed by cargo ships and barges, including spelljammers. Adventurers and other opportunists often overlooked heavy, bulky "treasure" such as iron ore, though in large enough quantities it could be worth their time to carry off.

Iron was a common metal found across Faerûn and beyond as mineral sand, various ores, and pure native iron. limonite, magnetite, pyrite, and siderite. All of them were considered hard minerals and therefore work-intensive to extract by miners.
Iron could be found by how it stained soil and water, giving a distinctive color and taste.
* The massive Lake of Steam had unique properties from dissolved iron and other minerals.
* The soil around Redspring was rich in iron, giving the spring water a bloody color and taste.
* The Umber Marshes were tinted their unique color by veins of iron beneath them.
* The city of Solon had red geothermal hot springs, infused by rich iron veins.

Iron ore was refined by laborious and filthy efforts at a bloomery furnace. One method involved dumping a layer of raw ore into a vertical furnace fed by forcefully pumped air, followed by a layer of limestone flux and then fuel such as charcoal, coal, or coke, then repeated until its own weight threatened to crush the burning coals. The limestone would bind with the non-metallic substance of the ore, separating from the iron into glassy slag tailings. As the ore melted, it would run to the bottom of the furnace and flow out into a crucible called the "hearth" where the slag would separate and float to the top, allowing it to be raked off and separated from the pure iron. The liquid iron was then poured into a series of channels dug into sand, the main "sow" channel lined with numerous "pig" cavities. After the sow and pigs solidified, they were broken apart with hammers and pulled out with hooks, clearing the channels for future castings. Alternatively, the iron could be poured into clay moulds that made specific products such as pots and pans, or into a clay-lined casting ladle that could dispense iron into smaller, more delicate project moulds.
The pig iron would then be further processed into wrought iron, the common form of worked iron. In this process the pig iron was purified of the excess carbon in charcoal fireboxes, making it more malleable and resilient.

* The Frozenfar was famously rich in all manner of mineral wealth, including iron. The largest known iron deposit in Faerûn lay below Ironmaster, a dwarven settlement dedicated to the mining and smelting of iron, refined into pots, pans, and forge bars that were then exported through Fireshear and Mirabar. In the Underdark nearby, the dwarven city of Hammerkeep in the Underdark possessed mines of pure native iron, though long lost to drow and derro.
* The Silver Marches were rich in minerals, especially iron, gold, silver, and copper. On the edge of the Evermoors, natural clefts near Nesmé yielded much easily-accessible iron, leading to the town having a dedicated ironworking industry. The village of Auvandell near Sundabar supplied the city with iron, copper, and lead, and the folk of Deadsnows mined iron, copper, and silver from the nearby Nether Mountains. To the north, the orcs of Dark Arrow Keep mined plentiful iron from deeper in the Spine of the World mountains.
* In the Northdark, the duergar city of Gracklstugh processed huge amounts of iron, using Themberchauds fiery breath to heat their forges. Elsewhere in the Northdark, the earth node Nuur Throth was a gigantic black iron lode.
* The Star Mounts in the High Forest had remarkably pure iron and nickel deposits that were mined by the elves of Eaerlann, but since the fall of the realm it went untouched.

* Beneath Waterdeep in the Deep Mines of Undermountain, the duergar mined mithral and iron, the latest group led by prince Valtagar Steelshadow. A few miles west of Waterdeep, the Black Dwarf Mine exploited a very pure vein of iron ore, with Aldurghen Stormhammer and his crew mining and forging the metal.
* The granite Serpent Hills had rich deposits of iron, silver, salt, and marble.thumb|250px|The Black Dwarf Mine dwarves forging iron.
* In the Moonshae Isles, Moray exported iron ore, while Callidyrr was a prominent center of iron mining and ironworking. One of the minining settlements in the Fairheight Range was Blackstone, source of some of the highest-quality iron in Faerûn. Nearby, the Northlander settlement of Gnarhelm also mined the Range.
* In Amn, the mines of Nashkel supplied iron to the entire region. Eshpurta was a center of metalworking and forged a great deal of iron, and was supplied by nearby iron and nickel mines in the Troll Mountains. The Gulf of Storms in the same mountains was a crystal- and iron-studded cleft that seemed to attract lightning bolts, and was actually a temple of Talos.
* In the desert of Anauroch, Aerithaes Rest in the Plain of Standing Stones had surface iron deposits that could be easily harvested with a hammer.
* Orc tribes mined iron in the Goblin Marches and Stonelands, using it to supply their own weapons and armor.

* The hills south of the Tangled Forest in the Cormanthor had deposits of iron that supported the unorthodox diets of introduced aurumvorax.
* On the Moonsea, Mulmaster was the largest single exporter of iron, with the city perpetually shadowed by the foundry smoke. Nearby Point Iron was a fair iron mine, though it was seized by duergar from below. Further west, Ironfang Keep sat atop and was surrounded by rich iron deposits, though the mystery and danger of the site kept any prospectors away.
* The Galena Mountains in northeast Faerûn were rich in iron ore, and humans and dwarves established mining communities there. Iron ore was exported from nearby Glister, along with silver and copper.
* Chult had great mineral wealth, with iron among it. The dwarves of Hrakhamar mined and worked iron and adamantine from beneath the Kobold Mountains.
* Lapaliiya was poor in iron and was a great importer of it. One of the few mines was near the metalworking city of Lhazantal, the City of Smiths.
* In the Hazur Mountains, scattered iron and gold mines were operated by Tashalaran humans and Thindolese gold dwarves, and also served as passages to the Burning Rift in the Underdark.
* The dwarves of the Great Rift mined and worked a great deal of metals, with ironworking centered at Eartheart. The richest mines were found at Glitterdelve, where they found iron, silver, gold, copper, and lead, and lesser mines at Rimmator that produced iron, copper, and tin.thumb|A piece of iron-bearing ore.
* Chessenta had large, untapped deposits of iron, copper, gold, and silver. The iron that it did produce was famously pure and high-quality, and was in wide demand in other lands. The nearby Akanapeaks had a good deal of iron that was mined by folk from Reth and Chessenta.

The dwarven realm of Ahruukar mined iron and hematite from beneath the Thesk Mountains, and exported the finished goods.
* Rashemen was quite iron-poor, with the duergar of Darzalstaukh competing with the surfacers for the limited sources. The lands most significant source of minerals were the Mines of Tethkel that provided a small but steady amount of iron.
* Solon in the Plains of Purple Dust was once famed for its iron mines, and they remained untapped after the citys abandonment.
* In the Shining Lands, iron was found in the surrounding mountains. In Durpar, the Dustwall Mountains were extremely rich in iron but almost entirely populated by hostile orcs, with ambitious dwarven expeditions managing to mine significant amounts. Adamas Tooth also had had fine iron and copper deposits, with the city of Sezilinta taking ore from the Tooth and Giants Belt Mountains to be worked and exported.

* Iron was commonly used for making simple, everyday items and tools such as caltrops, crowbars, hammers, pots, files, nails, hinges, locks, buckets, drills, chains, and manacles.
* Iron was the basic material used to make countless forms of weaponry and armor, though local circumstances affected how widely it was used. In much of Kara-Tur, the warmer, more humid climate made the use of heavy metal armor less common than in Faerûn. In Chult, iron and steel was rare but prized for weapons, while metal armor was completely unsuited for the tropical climate.
* Iron was used to make strong, resilient furnishings and constructions found in homes, castles, and dungeons. Timbers and stonework could be reinforced with iron, and doors, grates, and portcullises could be made partly or wholly of iron. Decorative yet functional elements such as railings and fences were also commonly made of iron.

* Rust monsters could smell metal from long distances, and happily pursued such meals with enthusiasm even if they were carried or worn. Preferring iron or steel over others, a touch of its wiggling antennae caused metal to corrode and fall to pieces, followed by dining. Even magical creations such as magical weapons, armor, and iron golems were reduced to scraps by their touch.
* Iron dragons were the most powerful of the ferrous dragons. They hoarded and ate iron ore, the substance necessary for their reproduction.

The Sarrukh were among the first to forge iron and steel, having mastered the metallurgy as their civilization rose in Okoth around , and used it to dominate the primitive humanoids of Faerûn.
The Second Age of Calimshan from  to  saw their armies marching forth to conquer surrounding lands, using a mix of iron and bronze weapons and armor.
In ancient Netheril, Kozah was depicted in art as holding three staves, made of the first iron forged, the first silver forged, and the first tree felled.
In , Netheril experienced an economic boom with the discovery of the rich mines of Dekanter, obtaining vast amounts of iron, platinum, mercury, silver, and gold. As the mines were worked out, the empty tunnels were used for magical research and secure storage. Despite their wealth and knowledge, a focus on magical enhancement over metallurgical techniques meant that the civilization made little progress, and advanced ironworking and steelmaking was never achieved.
The Netherese city of Scourge suffered from a strange environmental condition, as the salty wind blowing off the Narrow Sea rusted metal at an extraordinary rate, including magical items. The land around the city was even home to inordinate amounts of rust monsters. In , the city came under attack from Shining Tooth clan goblins, whose assault was shattered in part due to their metal weapons breaking.
The Netherese successor kingdom of Anauria was able to supply itself with iron and tin, but didnt have any copper and zinc.
Before the existence of Tethyr, dwarves delved around what would become Velen, finding a little iron ore but not enough to justify settlement.

The town of Llorkh grew up around shallow iron and silver mines in the Greypeak Mountains. These mines soon ran out and the town began shrinking, with the Zhentarim appearing to take over the dying settlement shortly after.
In 1368 DR, the Iron Throne attempted to seize control of the iron trade on the Sword Coast by sending agents to sabotage the Nashkel iron mine. They also hired the Chill and Blacktalons mercenaries to disrupt overland caravan trade, and secretly exploited the secret Cloak Wood mine to create their own supply of iron.
