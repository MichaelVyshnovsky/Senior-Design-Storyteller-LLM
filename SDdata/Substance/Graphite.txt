'''Graphite''' was a mineral form of [[carbon]], used as a [[material component]] and for making artwork.

==Description==
Graphite was a dark gray, lustrous mineral, very similar in appearance to molybdena, the ore of [[molybdenum]].

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold a graphite powder for 2 [[cp]] per {{SI|3|oz}} and solid chunks for 3 cp per {{SI|3|oz}}, which were suited for the rituals and practices of [[priest]]s. A pure graphitic carbon was also available for 3 [[gp]] per {{SI|6|oz}}, intended for the arcane experimentation of [[wizard]]s.

[[Cast iron]] left submerged in seawater would eventually corrode away, hiding the damage with a growing layer of graphite.{{Cite dragon/250/Sunken Fortunes|65}}

==Usages==
Graphite sticks were commonly used by artists for drawing.{{Cite dragon/104/Was it worth the risk?|18}}

Graphite powder was used as a lubricant for mechanical devices, especially for small and finely made locks.{{Cite dragon/271/Lock, Stock and Barrel|52}}

The ''[[write]]'' spell used graphite powder in its special [[ink]] when it was magically recorded in a [[spell scroll]] or [[spell book]].{{Cite dragon/62/Pages from the Mages|19}}

''[[Tanglefoot]]'' used a pinch of powdered graphite.
