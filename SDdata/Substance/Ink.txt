Ink was a substance used for drawing and writing.
Ink was usually black, but was often colored to be red.
Magically charged ink.
Ink could be used to scribe spells and spell scrolls, though this often required rare and special ink that apothecaries were unlikely to stock. Such ink could cost hundreds of gold pieces for a small flask, as they often required difficult-to-obtain ingredients, such as squid sepia, or ink from a giant octopus. Writing the fly spell required griffon feathers. The innards of behirs were able to be refined into inks for scribing magic scrolls, particularly for spells such as lightning bolt, neutralize poison, and protection from poison. The same was true for medusae, whose eyes and blood were valuable in inks used for scribing scrolls.
Cheap, effective paupers ink.
Some creatures naturally produced ink, such as giant octopuses, giant squids, and krakens.
Cheap ink could be made simply from soot or iron to give a dark pigment, combined with water or linseed oil, and bound together with dissolved glue.
