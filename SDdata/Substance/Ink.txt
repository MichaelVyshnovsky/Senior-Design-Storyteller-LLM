==Usage==
===Writing===

{{Quote
|I also bore a large [[brass]]-bound volume, [[quill]]s, and a supply of ink, intending to record my observations.
|[[Twick]] of [[Verdusk]]
}}
This liquid was used with [[ink pen]]s, which included quill pens and pens with ink reservoirs built in.

Ink was used all over [[Toril]], in continents such as [[Faerun]], [[Zakhara]], In [[Waterdeep]], {{SI|2|oz}} bottles of ink cost 1–4 [[gp]], though specialist [[gilt]] ink was used for illuminating [[paper]] records, which was made by the [[Stationers' Guild]].

{{Quote
|Disappearing ink is as indispensable as a mini-[[blade]] to a cutpurse.

[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] stocked a variety of inks, which came in different types and colors.<ref name=awrc-p68"> This catalogue also stocked [[disappearing ink]] that vanished some time after being applied to paper.<ref name=awrc-p19-20">

===Spells===
[[File:Magic Ink.png|thumb|''Magically charged ink.'']]
Ink could be used to scribe [[spell]]s and spell [[scroll]]s, though this often required rare and special ink that apothecaries were unlikely to stock. Such ink could cost hundreds of [[gold piece]]s for a small flask, as they often required difficult-to-obtain ingredients, such as [[squid sepia]], or ink from a [[giant octopus]]. Writing the ''[[fly]]'' spell required [[griffon]] feathers. The innards of [[behir]]s were able to be refined into inks for scribing magic scrolls, particularly for spells such as ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[neutralize poison]]'', and ''[[protection from poison]]''. The same was true for [[medusa]]e, whose eyes and blood were valuable in inks used for scribing scrolls.

[[File:Black Ink.png|thumb|''Common black ink.'']]
There were several spells that used ink as a part of the casting or as a [[material component]], such as ''[[write]]'', which required rare ink, ''[[illusory script]]'', which required [[lead]]-based ink, and ''[[Rary's mnemonic enhancer]]'', which required ink made of [[squid]] secretion combined with [[black dragon]] blood or [[giant slug]] intestinal fluid. ''[[Weapon bless]]'' also required ink made from [[dragon]]'s blood, ''[[invisibility to spirits]]'' required a jar of red ink, whilst ''[[spell immunity]]'', ''[[accuracy]]'', ''[[dream]]'', and ''[[memory]]'', and its counterpart ''[[erasement]]'', required standard ink. [[Asmiak]]'s variation of ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'' made use of ink. The ''[[unceasing vigilance of the holy sentinel]]'' spell needed a circle drawn in ink containing sapphire dust worth at least 1,000 [[gp]].

===Art===
The most popular style of art in Kara-Tur was the monochromatic "[[water]] and ink" style.

===Symbology===
{{Quote
|Red ink, friend. The tavern's closed.
|[[Amnian]] slang, where "red ink" meant bad news.
}}
Red ink was often used to symbolize bad news or worse scenarios in [[Amn]]. Saying "the ink couldn't be any redder" meant that things could not become any worse. In fact, red ink was also slang for [[fander]] (1 [[copper piece]]), the lowest form of currency in Amn.

==Production==
[[File:Pauper's Ink.png|thumb|''Cheap, effective pauper's ink.'']]
Some creatures naturally produced ink, such as giant octopuses, [[giant squid]]s, and [[kraken]]s.

Cheap ink could be made simply from [[soot]] or [[iron]] to give a dark pigment, combined with water or [[linseed oil]], and bound together with dissolved [[glue]].

==Notable Owners of Ink==
* The [[Paper Warrior]], a [[weapon master]] of [[Kara-Tur]], owned a dish full of ink. If it was interacted with, the ink flowed from its dish and formed words, which materialized as the Paper Warrior himself.

==Notable Types of Ink==
* [[Everdark]], a highly prized ink used by [[mage]]s in the [[Underdark]]. In order to make this specialist ink, [[deep dragon]] scales had to be placed in [[acid]].
* Squid ink was really common in [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|6}}
* Pauper's ink was a cheap, reliable type of ink.
