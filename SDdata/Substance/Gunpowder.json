        "Description": "Typically gunpowder would ignite (burn with an open flame), even explode (burn very rapidly){{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}} under the right conditions, but there were a number of [[crystal sphere]]s where this was not the case.<ref> And in some such worlds, gunpowder brought in them from another would be rendered inert. These differences in functionality across the Known Spheres was often written off as the whims of [[deities]], done to keep mortals in their place.<ref>\n\nGunpowder was typically sold within either small wooden [[powderkeg]]s or in [[powder horn]]s. The latter were typically water-proof, as gunpowder was rendered unusable when exposed to water.",

To reward his followers there for sheltering him, he revealed to them the secret of how to make the alchemical substance smokepowder as an alternative to gunpowder, which due to precise proportions of a magical ingredient could circumvent his magics, allowing it to ignite and explode. He also revealed to them how to create firearms utilizing the substance that were safe and reasonably accurate.\n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]], while Gond was in a weakened state and the nation of Lantan was in [[Abeir|another world]], the clergy of [[Kossuth]] tried to spread a claim that gunpowder's inert state on Toril was the doing of their god.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}}",

            "Weapons": "* On worlds where it was not inert, one of the primary uses for gunpowder was forming bombs.\n* On worlds where it was not inert, gunpowder was used in [[bombard]]s to propel heavy balls of cast [[iron]] or stones.\n* On worlds where it was not inert, gunpowder was primarily used for [[firearm]]s, propelling bullets out from their barrels.\n* [[Gunpowder wand]]s were one of the few firearms in the Realms that operated on specially enchanted gunpowder.",
            "Other Uses": "* In the Realms, some were known to use it as a powder, polishing ferrous metals with it to remove all rust.\n* Some in the Realms would encase metal items in a bucket, dish, or even larger cask of wetted gunpowder to thoroughly remove all corrosion."
