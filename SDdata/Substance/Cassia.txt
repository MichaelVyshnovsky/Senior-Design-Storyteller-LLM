'''Cassia''' was a natural plant [[resin]] extracted from the [[cassia tree]].

==Description==
Cassia was an aromatic, sweet-smelling resin, similar to [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]], and [[dragons' blood]].

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold cassia resin for 1 gp per {{SI|4|oz}}, intended for use by [[priest]]s as an aromatic ritual reagent.

Cassia trees were found in [[the Sword]] of [[Anauroch]], and harvested by the [[Bedine]]. The Bedine usually traded plant resins such as cassia, myrrh, frankincense, and dragons' blood to the [[D'tarig]] and other outsiders in exchange for metals they couldn't obtain otherwise. The D'tarig were their most common trade partner and also harvested cassia and other resins themselves, typically selling it on to [[Zhentarim]] merchants who then exported it to the rest of the [[Realms]].
