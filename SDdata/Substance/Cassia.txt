Cassia was a natural plant resin extracted from the cassia tree.
Cassia was an aromatic, sweet-smelling resin, similar to frankincense, myrrh, and dragons blood.
Auroras Emporium sold cassia resin for 1 gp per , intended for use by priests as an aromatic ritual reagent.
Cassia trees were found in the Sword of Anauroch, and harvested by the Bedine. The Bedine usually traded plant resins such as cassia, myrrh, frankincense, and dragons blood to the Dtarig and other outsiders in exchange for metals they couldnt obtain otherwise. The Dtarig were their most common trade partner and also harvested cassia and other resins themselves, typically selling it on to Zhentarim merchants who then exported it to the rest of the Realms.
