Vast amounts of sand could be found in the natural world, such as the deserts of Anauroch, and Raurin.
Wind could drive piles of sand into piles or hills called dunes, which could cover hundreds of square feet. The strongest of winds could blow dunes large distances in only several days. Dunes always had a steeper slope on the leeward side, where collapses were common. On occasion, a change of wind mid-formation caused a blowout, a hidden hollow cavity that collapsed under weight and sucked in people and animals. A sand crust could form from mud or salt residue, creating a thin, hard surface over a patch of deep, soft sand.
Sandstorms were harmful to most creatures, as the driving particles would reduce visibility and chafe skin.
Devil dunes were massive, malevolent forms of sand that resented trespassers, animated by magical power.
Quicksand was an area of treacherous ground, usually found in marshes or deserts. In marshes it was a waterlogged, near-liquid soil or sand, while in deserts it was formed from a fine, powdery sand that flowed like water. It was very dangerous to unprepared explorers, who could easily drown in it.
