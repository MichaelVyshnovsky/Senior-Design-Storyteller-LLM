'''Sand''' was a substance composed of small grains of finely ground up stone and other minerals. 

==Natural Occurrence==
[[File:Ascore.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''The ruins of [[Ascore]], buried in sand on the edge of Anauroch.'']]
Vast amounts of sand could be found in the natural world, such as the deserts of [[Anauroch]], and [[Raurin]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|28}}

Wind could drive piles of sand into piles or hills called dunes, which could cover hundreds of square feet. The strongest of winds could blow dunes large distances in only several days. Dunes always had a steeper slope on the leeward side, where collapses were common. On occasion, a change of wind mid-formation caused a blowout, a hidden hollow cavity that collapsed under weight and sucked in people and animals. A sand crust could form from mud or salt residue, creating a thin, hard surface over a patch of deep, soft sand.

Sandstorms were harmful to most creatures, as the driving particles would reduce visibility and chafe skin.

[[Devil dune]]s were massive, malevolent forms of sand that resented trespassers, animated by magical power.

[[Quicksand]] was an area of treacherous ground, usually found in marshes or deserts. In marshes it was a waterlogged, near-liquid soil or sand, while in deserts it was formed from a fine, powdery sand that flowed like water. It was very dangerous to unprepared explorers, who could easily drown in it.

==Availability==
* Fine sand could be bought from [[Aurora's Emporium]] for 1 [[sp]] per 10 lb.
* Fine sand was harvested from near [[Kirinwood]] for the glassmaking industry there.

==Usages==
[[File:Silex_Sand.png|thumb|''A bag of silex.'']]
* Silex was a fine, pure white sand, and was widely used for all manner of industrial purposes, including the production of [[potion]]s, [[glass]] and [[enamel]].
* [[Titania (material)|Titania]] was a white sand used to make brilliant white enamels, but had to be processed from [[ilmenite]].
* Sand was mixed with [[lime (material)|lime]] to make [[mortar]], used in construction.
* Exact measures of sand was used to fill [[hourglass]]es and minuteglasses for timekeeping.
* [[Hardsand]] was a dark, metallic sand derived from [[adamant]], used to surface harden metal for masterwork projects, or manufacture extremely strong [[putty]].
* Sand could bear high concentrations of metals, such as [[copper]], [[gold]], [[iron]], [[silver]], [[electrum]], [[quicksilver]], and even adamant or [[mithral]]. This sand could be used to make specialized potions, [[dye]]s, and [[ink]]s, or processed in large quantities to extract the metals in bulk.
* Sand was a potential material for [[golem]] construction, in particular the [[sand golem]].
* Sand was one of many materials used by the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] to fight fires in [[Waterdeep]].<ref>
* Zakharan artifice led to the creation of ''[[magical sand]]s'' used for various tasks. These included ''[[crystal sand|crystallizing]]'', ''[[thirsty sand|thirsty]]'', ''[[Sand cage|caging]]'', ''[[rasping sand|rasping]]'', ''[[sand of mirages|mirage]]'', ''[[sand of obscurement|obscuring]]'', ''[[Sand of sinking|sinking]]'', ''[[sand of restoration|restoring]]'', ''[[fire sand|fiery]]'', ''[[slow sand|slowing]]'', ''[[solid sand|solidifying]]'', and ''[[Sand of scintillation|scintillating]]'' varieties.{{Cite dragon/226/Campaign Classics: Magical Sands of Zakhara}} A similar but unrelated substance used in Zakhara was ''[[sand of truth]]''.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|6}}

===Spell Components===
Sand was used as a [[material component]] in many spells, many of which required no more than a pinch or handful of sand, though some demanded more complicated reagents. These included ''[[blast of sand]]'', ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[conjure sand lion]]'', ''[[cool strength]]'', ''[[dispel mirage]]'', ''[[dune]]'', ''[[dust curtain]]'', ''[[flowstone]]'', ''[[Leomund's secure shelter]]'', ''[[maskstone]]'', ''[[mirage wall]]'', ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[move dune]]'', ''[[persistent image]]'', ''[[river of sand]]'', ''[[sandcone]]'', ''[[sand form]]'', ''[[sand jambiya]]'', ''[[sand slumber]]'', ''[[sand shadow]]'', ''[[sandstorm (spell)|sandstorm]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[statue]]'', ''[[timewarp]]'', ''[[traceless travel]]'', ''[[transmute rock]]'', and ''[[watchware]]''.

[[Bedine]] magical traditions used sand or another elemental aspect of the desert as a component, and was known as "wind and sand magic". This included ''[[At'ar's fire]]'', ''[[sand worm]]'', and ''[[wind shadow]]''.<ref name="Anauroch-p76/>

==Creatures==
[[File:Brown dragon vs adventurers.png|thumb|''A brown dragon in its favored environment with its favored food.''|380x380px]]
* [[Blue dragon|Blue]], [[Brass dragon|brass]], [[Yellow dragon|yellow]], [[sand dragon|sand]], and [[brown dragon]]s preferred to make their homes in sandy deserts and wastelands, and were adept at burrowing through the material.
* [[Sandling]]s and [[Sandman|sandmen]] were [[elemental]]s made of sand. Other [[earth elemental]]s could be made of sand, but were somewhat weaker than those of soil or clay.
* [[Skriaxit]] were [[air elemental]]s also called ''living sandstorms'', and used sandstorms to tear apart their foes.
* Creatures such as [[sand flea]]s, [[sand cat]]s, [[sand giant]]s and [[Sand (individual)|Sand]] were not actually made of sand, nor was [[sand stew]], fortunately.

==Magic==
In the [[Zakhara]]n view of [[magic]], many spells related to the [[element of earth]] were grouped into the [[province of sand]]. [[Elemental mage]]s who specialized in sand were called sand mages.

Many spells existed that manipulated or affected sand in some way, especially from Bedine and Zakharan traditions.
* ''[[Awaken sand]]'' gave an amount of sand animus and intelligence.
* ''[[Black sand]]'' infused an area of sand with [[shadowstuff]] and [[negative energy]].
* ''[[Blast of sand]]'' sprayed a lethal blast of sand.
* ''[[Choking sands]]'' filled a target's lungs with sand.
* ''[[Control sand]]'' raised or lowered an area of sand.
* ''[[Desert fist]]'' animated an area of sand into a crushing fist.
* ''[[Dust curtain]]'' could create a small sandstorm.
* ''[[Hissing sand]]'' caused sand to flow as directed.
* ''[[Move dune]]'' moved a huge volume of sand.
* ''[[Move sand]]'' moved a large volume of sand.
* ''[[Part sand]]'' could form a passage through a mass of sand.
* ''[[Pillar of sand]]'' raised a pillar of sand up.
* ''[[Protection from normal missiles]]'' also extended protection against the effects of being caught in a sandstorm.
* ''[[River of sand]]'' created a destructive river of sand.
* ''[[Sandcone]]'' excavated a conical area of sand.
* ''[[Sand form]]'' created a sandy simulacrum of the target.

==Other==
* [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]]'s presence in the [[Calim Desert]] caused the ground to break apart into fine sand, spontaneously generating dry [[quicksand]].
* The [[Lands of Intrigue]] were also called the "Empires of the Sands", but this was a misnomer, as only [[Calimshan]] had deserts and neither [[Amn]] nor [[Tethyr]] had any deserts to speak of.
* The [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] contained a great deal of sand and other similar materials.
