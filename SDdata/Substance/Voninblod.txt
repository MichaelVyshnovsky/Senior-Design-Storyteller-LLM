Voninblod (meaning "titan blood" in Jotun), was a type of magical substance created by giants in the days of Ostoria.
This substance was blue in coloration.
Around the late-15 century DR, ancient containers of voninblod were occasionally found around Bryn Shander, Cold Run, and Lonelywood.
Voninblod was highly valued for use in enchanting items, such as relic armors.
