'''Halamda''' was the [[Faer√ªn]]ian form of [[Wikipedia:nitroglycerin|nitroglycerin]].

==Properties==
Halamda was a clear jelly.

Following its alteration, halamda no longer exploded, but rather healed and preserved. It easily permeated living or dead tissue, and cured infections, ended rot, and neutralized strong acids. It was used to clean and protect wounds, as well as stop flesh-eating diseases, natural decay, and similar phenomena. It could be used to preserve tissue samples or entire corpses for later examination, or protect severed limbs for later reattachment.

As it was non-toxic and did not taint or alter what it permeated, it was also used to preserve [[fish]] and meat for long-term storage and travel.

==History==
Halamda was invented by [[gnome]]s some time after the invention of [[gunpowder]], and was used as an explosive substance. Later, the god of invention [[Gond]] noted with dismay that his followers were continually blowing themselves up with it, killing those inside of his church and frightening away those outside of it. To solve the issue, he used his dominion over such inventions to alter the properties of halamda, allowing it to be used as a beneficial and benign invention.
