        "mainbody": "lood rock was a rare, magical variety of stone that would form at areas where great violence was committed, such as the site of a great slaughter, a site of ceremonial sacrifices, or the site of an ancient battlefield.\nThis stone was charged with necromantic energy, or what some described as being the very essence of war and violence. Its name was derived from the mineral streaks that ran through it, which were blood red in coloration.\nWhen carried around, blood rocks did not impart any special benefits. But when one stood upon it, a creature had a far greater chance of inflicting a significant wound upon a foe, making weapons strike harder and claws tear deeper than they would otherwise.\nA creature that died upon blood rock would have its life force pulled at by the necromantic energies that suffused it. This led to all fluids in a corpse quickly draining, leaving it as a shriveled husk within a matter of a few days.\nBlood rock naturally occurred on some Outer Planes. It could be found in parts of the Elemental Chaos. And on the Prime Material world of Toril, it could be found in parts of the Thunder Peaks and in some of the rubble of the Spellgard ruins.\nIf extracted, blood rock could be used to infuse the earth or stone of another location with the same violent essence it gave off. For every  of area that one wished to deliberately seed with blood rock,  of the material was required. Once set, it took a period of 48 hours or more before the presence of blood rock would permeate the area."
