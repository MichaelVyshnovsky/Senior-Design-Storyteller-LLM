'''Charcoal''' was a common form of processed wood used as a fuel, similar to [[coke]] and [[coal]].

==Properties==
Charcoal was a hard, black, ashy, [[carbon]]-rich mineral-like substance that burned readily.{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|61}}{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|7}} It was valued for how it burned hotter, faster, and cleaner than raw wood, making it a superior fuel for heating, cooking, forging, and other purposes.

==Availability==
Charcoal was the fuel of choice for much of [[Toril]]. Some regions were dependent on dried animal [[dung]], sheaves of [[straw]], or [[oil]] from [[whale]]s or [[fish]], but wood charcoal was the most widespread and convenient source of fuel to be found.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/08-01 - Petroleum Oil in the Realms}}

Sylvan [[elves]] limited their use of charcoal in industry by means of elaborate forges that used ''[[Wall of force|walls of force]]'' to contain and concentrate the heat, allowing for hot fires with far less fuel consumption and lessened risk of accidental fires.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/03-23 - Elven Forging}}

[[Aurora's Emporium]] supplied high-quality charcoal intended for [[priest]]ly rituals for 1 [[gp]] per pound.

===Crafting===
Charcoal was made by charcoal-burners, or "colliers", by slowly burning [[wood]] or [[peat]] over several days in a smouldering air-starved fire, such as in a specialized kiln, in a turf-covered mound, or in a fire choked with clay.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/06-05 - Fuel in the Realms}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/07-06 - Ulgoth's Beard, Part 1}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/01-26 - Drow of Ardeep}}

The sustainable long-term harvesting of tree limbs for fuel or carpentry, called "coppicing", was widely practiced in lands such as [[Cormyr]], [[Chessenta]], [[Tethyr]], [[Turmish]], and the [[Dales]], and most rural farming families, communities, and estates kept extensive woodlots for coppicing to ensure they were self-sufficient in fuel and timber. The wood was burned to charcoal locally, and the excess was exported to fuel-hungry cities in metal boxes. On occasion, charcoal was scented with various substances to produce pleasing aromas when burned.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/01-11 - Average Heartlands Farm}}

Priests of [[Silvanus]] helped to protect woodlands from over-exploitation by organizing the production of charcoal from downed wood, as well as the production of peat, manure, and oil-based fuels.
