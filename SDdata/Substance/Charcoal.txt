Charcoal was a common form of processed wood used as a fuel, similar to coke and coal.
Charcoal was a hard, black, ashy, carbon-rich mineral-like substance that burned readily. It was valued for how it burned hotter, faster, and cleaner than raw wood, making it a superior fuel for heating, cooking, forging, and other purposes.
Charcoal was the fuel of choice for much of Toril. Some regions were dependent on dried animal dung, sheaves of straw, or oil from whales or fish, but wood charcoal was the most widespread and convenient source of fuel to be found.
Sylvan elves limited their use of charcoal in industry by means of elaborate forges that used walls of force to contain and concentrate the heat, allowing for hot fires with far less fuel consumption and lessened risk of accidental fires.
Auroras Emporium supplied high-quality charcoal intended for priestly rituals for 1 gp per pound.
Charcoal was made by charcoal-burners, or "colliers", by slowly burning wood or peat over several days in a smouldering air-starved fire, such as in a specialized kiln, in a turf-covered mound, or in a fire choked with clay.
The sustainable long-term harvesting of tree limbs for fuel or carpentry, called "coppicing", was widely practiced in lands such as Cormyr, Chessenta, Tethyr, Turmish, and the Dales, and most rural farming families, communities, and estates kept extensive woodlots for coppicing to ensure they were self-sufficient in fuel and timber. The wood was burned to charcoal locally, and the excess was exported to fuel-hungry cities in metal boxes. On occasion, charcoal was scented with various substances to produce pleasing aromas when burned.
Priests of Silvanus helped to protect woodlands from over-exploitation by organizing the production of charcoal from downed wood, as well as the production of peat, manure, and oil-based fuels.
