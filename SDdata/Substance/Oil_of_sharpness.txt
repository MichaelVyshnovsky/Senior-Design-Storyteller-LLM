One flask of oil allowed for between three to five applications. Depending on the quality of the formulation, an application granted a weapon anywhere from a ''+1'' to ''+6'' enhancement.

During the early [[Era of Upheaval]], a single flask of ''oil of sharpness'' ranged in price from 4,000 to 24,000 [[gp]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], enough oil for a single application cost a mere 10 gp.
