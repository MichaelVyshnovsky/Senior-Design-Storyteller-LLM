'''Gunpowder''' or '''blackpowder'''{{Cite dragon/60/Firearms|26-27}} was a substance that existed across many worlds in the [[multiverse]] that was similar to the magic alchemical substance known as [[smokepowder]].<ref><ref>

==Description==
Typically gunpowder would ignite (burn with an open flame), even explode (burn very rapidly){{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}} under the right conditions, but there were a number of [[crystal sphere]]s where this was not the case.<ref> And in some such worlds, gunpowder brought in them from another would be rendered inert. These differences in functionality across the Known Spheres was often written off as the whims of [[deities]], done to keep mortals in their place.<ref>

Gunpowder was typically sold within either small wooden [[powderkeg]]s or in [[powder horn]]s. The latter were typically water-proof, as gunpowder was rendered unusable when exposed to water.

==Creation==
[[Charcoal]], [[nitre]], and [[sulfur]] were components of this substance.

==Availability==
* Gunpowder could be found on [[Toril]], but due to to powerful magics cast by the deity [[Gond]] the substance was inert.In 2017, [[Ed Greenwood]] stated in a [https://web.archive.org/web/20210517004301/https://twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953 tweet] that the reason gunpowder didn't work on Toril was because executives at [[TSR, Inc.]] didn't want it firearms in the setting and that [[Jeff Grubb]] later conceived of smokepowder for use with the giff. On rare occasions, Gond would allow high-ranking [[priest]]s of his [[Church of Gond|church]] to [[divine magic|divinely]] [[item enchantment|enchant]] gunpowder into a non-inert state, but never enough to threaten the dominance of smokepowder. These priests were willing to sell this gunpowder, but only to those that sought to use it for the greater glory of their deity.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-05-04 - Gunpowder Wand and Working Gunpowder}}
* In [[Loudwater]], the [[Loudwater Apothecary|local apothecary]] sold gunpowder.<ref>

===Beyond the Realms===
* [[Earth]], a planet where gunpowder functioned normally.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)/How Earth Tech Functions in the Realms}}
* [[Krynn]] was known to lack gunpowder.{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}}
* [[Oerth]] was a planet that had gunpowder, but its local magic and physics rendered the substance inert.{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|36}}
* Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], gunpowder could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]],<ref> such as [[Barovia]].<ref>

==History==
Over time, Gond witnessed many mortals dying in explosions from experimenting with gunpowder.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-08 - When Gunpowder Went Inert}}<ref><ref><ref><ref group="note" name="Years">The two dates presented are based on the sourcebooks ''[[Grand History of the Realms]]'' & [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' (2nd edition)]], which both state that the Lantanese first tested bombards in [[1246 DR]] (later explained by Ed to be using gunpowder), and ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'', which is set between [[1356 DR|1356]]&mdash;[[1357 DR]] and states that gunpowder does not function on Toril.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], Gond in his mortal [[avatar]] form washed up on the shores of [[Lantan]]. To reward his followers there for sheltering him, he revealed to them the secret of how to make the alchemical substance smokepowder as an alternative to gunpowder, which due to precise proportions of a magical ingredient could circumvent his magics, allowing it to ignite and explode. He also revealed to them how to create firearms utilizing the substance that were safe and reasonably accurate.

Following the [[Spellplague]], while Gond was in a weakened state and the nation of Lantan was in [[Abeir|another world]], the clergy of [[Kossuth]] tried to spread a claim that gunpowder's inert state on Toril was the doing of their god.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}}

==Usage==
===Weapons===
* On worlds where it was not inert, one of the primary uses for gunpowder was forming bombs.
* On worlds where it was not inert, gunpowder was used in [[bombard]]s to propel heavy balls of cast [[iron]] or stones.
* On worlds where it was not inert, gunpowder was primarily used for [[firearm]]s, propelling bullets out from their barrels.
* [[Gunpowder wand]]s were one of the few firearms in the Realms that operated on specially enchanted gunpowder.

===Other Uses===
* In the Realms, some were known to use it as a powder, polishing ferrous metals with it to remove all rust.
* Some in the Realms would encase metal items in a bucket, dish, or even larger cask of wetted gunpowder to thoroughly remove all corrosion.

==Trivia==
[[Wizard]]s could learn how to make gunpowder from the [[spell]] ''[[Alamir's fundamental breakdown]]''.<ref>
