'''Dragons' blood''' was a natural plant [[resin]] found in the [[Anauroch]] desert.

==Description==
Dragons' blood was an amber-hued, aromatic resin, similar to the better-known [[myrrh]] and [[frankincense]].

==Availability==
Trees that bore dragons' blood were found in the mountainous eastern and northeastern [[The Sword|Sword]], and in the foothills along the southern edge of the [[Plain of Standing Stones]]. It grew among the same trees that produced myrrh and frankincense, and was harvested by the [[Bedine]]. A raw fist-sized lump of dragons' blood was worth about 5 [[sp]] to the Bedine, but after being exported to other lands the price increased precipitously.
