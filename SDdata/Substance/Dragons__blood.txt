Dragons blood was a natural plant resin found in the Anauroch desert.
Dragons blood was an amber-hued, aromatic resin, similar to the better-known myrrh and frankincense.
Trees that bore dragons blood were found in the mountainous eastern and northeastern Sword, and in the foothills along the southern edge of the Plain of Standing Stones. It grew among the same trees that produced myrrh and frankincense, and was harvested by the Bedine. A raw fist-sized lump of dragons blood was worth about 5 sp to the Bedine, but after being exported to other lands the price increased precipitously.
