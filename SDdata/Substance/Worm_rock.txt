Worm rock was a special type of stone that was easier for burrowing creatures to dig through than normal stone.
These stones were highly porous and orange in coloration. Burrowing creatures found it easier to dig through than other stones, leaving them often riddled with thousands of tunnels, but any removed material would eventually grow back over the course of weeks or months. It also provided minimal nutrition to creatures that burrowed through it.
Worm rock could be found throughout the Feydark.
In the wake of the Second Era of Skyfire, worm rock could be found in parts of the Calim Desert.
Creatures unable to make their own burrows often made homes within the tunnels left by burrowing creatures.
