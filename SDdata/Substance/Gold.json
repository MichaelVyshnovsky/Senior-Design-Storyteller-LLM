        "mainbody": "Gold was a pure precious metal that was used in Faerûn as the baseline of most currency. Despite its high value it was fairly commonly found throughout Toril.\nGold was a soft, malleable and exceptionally conductive metal.\nthumb|A treasure chest filled with gold coins.\nMost coins in Faerûn worked off of the silver and gold standard, with copper pieces (cp) being worth  1/100th of a gold piece (gp) and silver pieces (sp) being worth 1/10 of a gp. and platinum coins were worth 10 gp.Unfortunately, for both of these statements to be true, a typical gold coin had very little gold in it and was either alloyed with a much lighter metal, like aluminum, or was made of a gold-clad wooden disk. The density of gold is 19.32 g/cm³ and a pure gold coin of those dimensions would weigh about  or over five times the weight of a \"standard\" coin. This suggests that the dimensions of a standard coin should be smaller and thinner. Any less than that and they were considered by most to be \"shaved\" and worth less than newly minted coins.\nThe metal was valuable to many artisans for its malleability and aesthetic qualities.\nGold was prized by many wizards for its magical properties. If refined and treated with the right magical processes, gold could become as hard as steel and used to forge effective armor and weapons, which could hold a number of enchantments, even those that conflicted one another. While it offered significant protection against fire and acid, golden armor was twice as heavy as steel and more encumbering.\nGold was specifically used in the crafting of shoonrings that had multiple magical properties.\nGold was favored by the gods Abbathor, Geb, Hanali Celanil, Thard Harr, Ubtao, and Vergadain and seen as a sign of their blessings.\nWaukeen, the goddess of wealth and trade, was known as Our Lady of Gold, and was said to wield a cloud of gold coins as a weapon."
