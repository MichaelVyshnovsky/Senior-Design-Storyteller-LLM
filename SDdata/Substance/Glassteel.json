It was stronger than iron but only half as heavy. Furthermore, it was fully translucent.\nIt was made with a complex metallurgical and alchemical process that also required extensive knowledge of glass-blowing. This technique was discovered by the sun elves and avariel.\nGlassteel cost ~100 gp per .\nIt was mostly used as a construction material in fantastic castles, Some also used it to create weapons and armor, though for most, the cost of doing this was prohibitively expensive, especially when crafting armor. Glassteel armor was much lighter than others of its kind, enabling greater ease of movement.\n*Cracker and Whacker, twin morning stars of the dwarf Athrogate. They were made of gray glassteel with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of adamantine chains.\n*Rods of frost were glassteel rods bound with iron bands, allowing the wielder to fire rays of freezing cold.\n*Storm armor was a specialty full plate from the Knights of the Flying Hunt in Halruaa, created by the Nimbral Lords.\n*Orbbcress, a shield that belonged to Tiago Baenre, spotted with diamonds.\n*Vidrinath, a sword that belonged to Tiago Baenre, imbued with diamonds..\n*Aerie of the Snow Eagles, the great temple of Aerdrie Faenya, was made of great sheets of glassteel."
