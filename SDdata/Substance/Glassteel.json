        "mainbody": "'''Glassteel''' was a material that was as strong as [[steel]] and as transparent as [[glass]].",
        "Properties": "Glassteel lacked the normal greenish tint of glass, instead gleaming a dullish and almost translucent gray.<ref> It was stronger than [[iron]] but only half as heavy. Furthermore, it was fully translucent.",
        "Fabrication": "It was made with a complex metallurgical and [[alchemical]] process that also required extensive knowledge of glass-blowing. This technique was discovered by the [[sun elves]] and [[avariel]].\n\nGlassteel cost ~100 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}.",
        "Application": "It was mostly used as a construction material in fantastic castles, Some also used it to create weapons and armor, though for most, the cost of doing this was prohibitively expensive, especially when crafting armor. Glassteel armor was much lighter than others of its kind, enabling greater ease of movement.",
        "Notable Crafts": "*''[[Cracker and Whacker]]'', twin [[morning star]]s of the [[dwarf]] [[Athrogate]]. They were made of gray [[glassteel]] with spiked metal heads attached to the ends of [[adamantine]] chains.\n*''[[Rods of frost]]'' were glassteel rods bound with [[iron]] bands, allowing the wielder to fire rays of freezing cold.\n*''[[Storm armor]]'' was a specialty [[full plate]] from the [[Knights of the Flying Hunt]] in [[Halruaa]], created by the [[Nimbral Lords]].\n*''[[Orbbcress]]'', a [[shield]] that belonged to [[Tiago Baenre]], spotted with [[diamond]]s.\n*''[[Vidrinath]]'', a [[sword]] that belonged to Tiago Baenre, imbued with diamonds..\n*[[Aerie of the Snow Eagles]], the great temple of [[Aerdrie Faenya]], was made of great sheets of glassteel."
