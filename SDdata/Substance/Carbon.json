        "mainbody": "Carbon was an elemental material found in the Realms.\nCarbon was commonly found in the near-pure forms of soot, charcoal, coke, and graphite. It was much more rarely encountered as diamonds, a pure and naturally forming kind of crystalline carbon.\nAuroras Emporium sold amorphous carbon for 1 gp per  and graphitic carbon for 3 gp per , which were intended for the arcane uses of wizards.\nThe Elemental Store of Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental carbon for 2 gp per .\n* Star metal was naturally composed of iron infused with carbon.\n* Iron and steel used carbon in the alloying process to improve the metal. Too much would render the metal brittle and useless.\n* The enchanted weapon weapon spell used some powdered carbon and lime."
