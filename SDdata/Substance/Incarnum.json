        "mainbody": "Incarnum was a form of raw magic, the ever-present magical energy that permeated all life and existence.\nIncarnum manifested as wisps of pure magical energy.\nLike other magical practices, such as the Art, the Power, or truename magic, incarnum was one of the numerous means to draw upon the power of the Weave. It was however radically different than those practices.\nIncarnum predominantly appeared in the Realms following profound events that altered or reshaped the Weave. The three deaths of the goddesses of magic were such notable events\n* Mystryl sacrificing her own life, following the events of Karsus Folly.\n* The death of Mystra by Helm during the Time of Troubles.\n* The murder of Midnight by Cyric and Shar, at the onset of the Blue Breath of Change.\nAdditionally, the presence of the gods as mortals during the Time of Troubles was itself significant enough to reshape the Weave and manifest incarnum.\nWielders of incarnum were known as meldshapers, but had other names depending on how they used their powers. Many incarnates wielded their powers with some ignorance as to their source of origin. They included\n* Incarnates, who embodied extreme principals in their practice of incarnum magic.\n* Soulborn, warriors of supernatural power that possessed strong moral tendencies towards good or evil.\n* Totemists, tribal shamans who viewed incarnum as a form of old spiritual energy.\nIn addition to standing within divine presence, incarnates could manifest their powers after being exposed to wild magic or powerful spells or magical phenomena.\nThe amount of accessible incarnum increased throughout the Realms drastically following the , and the Time of Troubles. As the deities of Toril walked upon the world as mortals, they attracted many mortal followers who absorbed the incarnum that manifested in their wake. Some of these followers developed the powers of meldshapers and focused on one extreme aspect of their deitys moral and ethical outlook.\nSome scholars that specialized in the study of magic theorized that meldshaping was a primordial form of heavy magic manipulation."
