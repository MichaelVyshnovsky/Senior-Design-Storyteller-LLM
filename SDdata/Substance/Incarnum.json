        "mainbody": "'''Incarnum''' was a form of [[raw magic]], the ever-present magical energy that permeated all life and existence.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Incarnum}}",
        "Description": "Incarnum manifested as wisps of pure magical energy.",
        "Properties": {
            "Availability": "Incarnum predominantly appeared in the Realms following profound events that altered or reshaped the Weave. The three deaths of the goddesses of magic were such notable events:\n* [[Mystryl]] sacrificing her own life, following the events of [[Karsus' Folly]].\n* The death of [[Mystra]] by [[Helm]] during the [[Time of Troubles]].\n* The murder of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]] by [[Cyric]] and [[Shar]], at the onset of the [[Blue Breath of Change]].\n\nAdditionally, the presence of the gods as mortals during the Time of Troubles was itself significant enough to reshape the Weave and manifest incarnum."
        },
        "Applications": "Wielders of incarnum were known as [[meldshaper]]s, but had other names depending on how they used their powers. Many incarnates wielded their powers with some ignorance as to their source of origin. They included:\n* [[incarnate (practitioner)|Incarnate]]s, who embodied extreme principals in their practice of incarnum magic.\n* [[Soulborn]], warriors of supernatural power that possessed strong moral tendencies towards [[good]] or [[evil]].\n* [[Totemist]]s, tribal [[shaman]]s who viewed incarnum as a form of old spiritual energy.\n\nIn addition to standing within divine presence, incarnates could manifest their powers after being exposed to [[wild magic]] or powerful [[spell]]s or magical phenomena.",
        "History": "The amount of accessible incarnum increased throughout the Realms drastically following the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, and the Time of Troubles. As the deities of [[Toril]] walked upon the world as mortals, they attracted many mortal followers who absorbed the incarnum that manifested in their wake. Some of these followers developed the powers of meldshapers and focused on one extreme aspect of their deity's [[alignment|moral and ethical outlook]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some scholars that specialized in the study of magic theorized that meldshaping was a primordial form of [[heavy magic]] manipulation."
