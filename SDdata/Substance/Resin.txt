'''Resin''' was a broad class of substances produced from the sap of plants and some animals, and used for a wide array of purposes. Depending on the type, it could also be known as '''gum'''.

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold a variety of high-quality gums and resins at reasonable prices, suited for the rituals and practices of [[priest]]s, the arcane experimentation of [[wizard]]s, as well as more common variants suited for everyday use.

==Usages==
Resins were widely used in the production of food, [[perfume]], [[candy]], [[adhesive]]s, and [[alchemical]] recipes. They were also used in medicine for their curative properties. Certain resins could also be used in the construction of furniture and buildings as [[glue]] and as [[varnish]].{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|7}}{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|62,64}}
