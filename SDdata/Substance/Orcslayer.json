        "mainbody": "rcslayer, or blood-metal, was an alloy of steel that was poisonous to orcs.The only known example of an orcslayer blade is Sarghathuld, which is simply an orc bane weapon, suggesting orcslayer is simply mechanically the orc bane weapon property. However, the ability to make bane weapons is apparently not lost in the 14 century. Sargathuld has additional enhancements, so its orc bane ability may be a much stronger version of orcslayer.\nOrcslayer was a dull gray metal.\nIn the late 6 and early 7 centuries DR, dwarves were determinedly expanding into the orcish kingdom of Vastar in the lands later known as the Vast, and attacking the orcs. Working secretly with a few humans and elves, they sought to develop a steel toxic to orcs, and succeeded with the metal they called \"orcslayer\". Deep King Tuir Stonebeard requested over a thousand orcslayer weapons and, working hard over several years, Master Smith Fyrfar Smokebeard forged them and High Old One Turbaern, aided by the human mage Beldossan the Short and the elven sorceress Aleratha Ilnatar, enchanted them. Among these was the short sword Sarghathuld, forged in the Year of the Many Serpents, 605 DR.\nIn the Year of the Spellfire, 610 DR, armed with their new orcslayer blades, the dwarves surged out of the mountains to slaughter the orcs of Vastar, quickly toppling the kingdom and driving the survivors into the mountains.\nThe sage Fairin Icemantle expressed great reservations about orcslayer metal, and wrote the Treatise Against Blood-Metal to protest its use. He feared that it would lead to the development of other alloys toxic to many races, and spread death and destruction.\nFortunately, the art of making orcslayer metals was long lost by 1370 DR."
