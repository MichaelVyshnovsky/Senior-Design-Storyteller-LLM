Coins of Waukeen were a special variety of currency that the deity Waukeen, a goddess of trade and wealth who was known to show her favor by manifesting money, would manifest before mortals on Toril.
These coins bore the holy symbol of Waukeen.  Multiple coins within shining, yellow coin purses manifested upon the bodies of powerful slain monsters, typically when such a death helped to protect merchants and trade routes.

The exact economic value of these coins was uncertain, but they could often be traded to devout merchants of Waukeen in return for special gilded equipment. These included bows, daggers, greatswords, holy symbols, longswords, maces, orbs, pact blades, and shields. In rarer cases, they could receive cloaks or robes sewed with golden thread, a gold crown, or even the notable golden pantaloons.
During the late 15 century DR, a number of adventurers around Neverwinter and across the greater Sword Coast encountered coin purses containing coins of Waukeen and gold dye. Adventurers in Neverwinter often traded their coins to a merchant that hung around the Moonstone Mask. A select few adventurers were noted as receiving from the merchant a miniature, domesticated mimic that looked like a red, gilded strongbox.
