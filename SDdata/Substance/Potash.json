        "mainbody": "otash was a manufactured substance that was widely used in the Realms.\nPotash was widely produced around Faerûn, in a process that involved soaking the ashes of wood fires.\nThe Bedine of Anauroch produced and exported large amounts of potash, as well as the derivative soap and glass. The processes to make these were held as secrets by certain Bedine tribes, who did not believe that wider Faerûn knew how to produce potash, glass, or soap. If an outlander professed to know such a process, they were killed to protect the \"secret\".\nPotash was used in a large array of techniques, including the production of glass, soap, and textiles, including felt, silk, and menga cloth."
