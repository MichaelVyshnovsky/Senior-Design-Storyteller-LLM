'''Dlarun''', also known as '''icesteel''', was a non-natural white metal that was unknown to most peoples of [[Faerûn]], save for select groups of [[halfling]]s. The "good folk" were quite secretive about their knowledge of dlarun, often giving misleading descriptions or feigning ignorance if it was ever brought up in conversation.

==Description==
This lightweight metal was bone white in color with a high polish that shone green when illuminated by candles or [[magic]]al sources of light. Considering it was a more esoteric substance, it could easily be mistaken for [[ivory]].

==Uses==
Dlarun was often used in the creation of small figurines, engraved plates, or the pommels of [[weapon]]s, often in the shape of an acorn, claw, or other symbols of nature. If a piece of [[magic]]al jewelry or other decorative item made from dlarun came into contact with the wearer's skin, it would confer to the wearer a limited ability allowing them to see through [[illusion]]s and ignore certain [[Psionics|psionic effects]]. [[Armor]] crafted from the metal offered limited protection from fire, and weapons would strike with an icy frost. 

This unique metal was not suited for the creation of items that were intended to carry an [[Item enchantment|enchantment]] related to flame, such as a ''[[flame tongue]]''.

Followers of [[Urogalan]] sometimes gave unworked dlarun as offerings during an [[Earthrising]] ceremony and some priests of He Who Must Be used a statuette of a hound made of dlarun as their [[holy symbol]].

==Creation==
The formation of dlarun involved digging up clay from certain river beds located throughout [[Faerûn]], heating them up in a crucible and mixing the resulting white flakes with certain oils. The soft, malleable metal was then heated again in a fire whose fuel included specific, secret elements.
