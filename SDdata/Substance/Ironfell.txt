Ironfell, also called "the iron" by the Warlock Knights of Vaasa, was a magical, metal-like substance mined from the constantly regenerating body of the fallen primordial Telos.
Worked ironfell was lusterless in color. It had a crystalline structure but otherwise had a similar appearance and hardness as steel, and accepted enchantment readily. 
A warlock who had made a star pact with Telos was able to use weapons and armor made from ironfell to channel the primordials power, which manifested as radiant light emanating from the weapons and protection from the same by the armor. Items made from the substance could also be used in ritual magic, such as the Pact of the Iron Ring.
Ironfell was used to make weapons, equipment, and magic items for the Warlock Knights. All Warlock Knights wore a simple ironfell ring to signify their status, and most Knights above a certain rank owned distinctive ceremonial armor also made of the substance.
By the late 15 century DR, the Warlock Knights were integrating ironfell into their realms currency by creating alloys of it with traditional precious metals the copper and ironfell alloyed coins were called nubs, silver and ironfell alloyed coins were called dirks, gold and ironfell alloyed coins were called anvils, and the platinum and ironfell alloy was minted into thin trade bars worth 50 anvils each.
Ironfell was also used to make golem-like constructs called shardsouls.
Telos fell to Faer√ªn during the Spellplague and landed in the wastes of Vaasa. After his body was discovered, ironfell began to be harvested from it, and it was soon determined that this material could be used to siphon the power of the comatose primordial for use in combat. This discovery led to the formation of the Warlock Knights, who would go on to use Telos power to conquer Vaasa in the mid-to-late 15 Century DR.
The Knights built their capital city on top of Telos which was named in his honor.
