'''Dragonhide''', also written '''dragon hide''', was the skin of a [[dragon]].

==Properties==
Dragonhide could be used to fashion masterful, meaning good enough to be enchanted, [[armor]]s and/or [[shield]]s from it. The resulting products were in no way different from ordinary ones, but with one exception: dragonhide could not be destroyed by the kind of energy that the dragon whose skin it was breathed. So it was entirely possible that the wearer of a dragonhide armor could die in a blast of a [[dragon breath|dragon's breath]], while the armor remained intact, if the breath weapon used the same energy as the dragonhide's dragon's breath weapon.

==Applications==
As mentioned above, dragonhide could be used for crafting armors and shields, and was highly valued by the [[:category:armorers|armorers]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. People used dragonhide armor for mostly ornamental reasons for it conferred no beneficial properties to them. There was no difference in time nor cost compared to the creation of ordinary armor and shield of masterful quality when creating a dragonhide armor or shield.

In order for a piece of dragon hide to used to craft armor, it had to be at least 3' (0.9 m) long on any side and free from puncture marks, slashes, burns or any other imperfections that weakened its integrity. As the renowned dragon-slayer [[Smerdiuk Dragonbane]] wrote in his [[book|manual]], ''[[The Compleat Dragon-Hunter]]'': ''"damage grevious enough to slay a dragon will often make its entire hide unusable"''.

A specifically trained person could create a [[dragoncraft item]] from dragonhide, which did indeed confer beneficial benefits in the form of a minor resistance against the donor-dragon's breath weapon's energy type.

==Production==
Dragonhide was produced by skinning a dragon.
