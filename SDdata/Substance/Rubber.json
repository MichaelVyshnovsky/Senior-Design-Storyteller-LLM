        "Properties": "Rubber was notable for its ability to bounce and to float.{{Cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |http://archive.today/2024.11.27-035741/https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1254254364014845952|title= Ed's Twitter |date=2020-04-25 |accessdate=2024-11-26}} Depending on the treatment and production, it could be flexible or stiff. Other valuable properties associated with rubber included its toughness and its ability to stretch and deform before returning to its original shape. It could also provide effective insulation (and thus protection) against [[electricity]]{{Cite dragon/94/Creature Catalog II|50}} and could accept [[magic]]al [[enchantment]]s.{{Cite dungeon/30/Elminster's Back Door|17}}\n\nBy weight, {{SI|1|cubic foot|long=yes}} of soft rubber was {{SI|69|pounds|k|long=yes}} while hard rubber was {{SI|74|pounds|k|long=yes}}.{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|6}}\n\nThe smell of burnt rubber was generally perceived as foul.<ref name=\"DragMag153-p48>{{Cite dragon/153/Game Wizards|48}}",
        "Applications": {
            "Games and Toys": "In [[Faer没n]], commonfolk in cities like [[Waterdeep]] had access to cheap rubber [[ball]]s which were used to play [[jacks]]. Similar rubber balls were used to play [[boule]], a casino game in which the ball was spun around a special numbered [[bowl]] and gamblers would bet on where it would land.{{Cite polyhedron/41/The Living City: Volodar's Stardust Inn|26}} \n\nAlso in Faer没n, rubber bath toys (including those shaped like [[duck]]s) were favored by the likes of [[Elminster]] and [[Mirt]].\n\nIn [[Malatra]], rubber was used exclusively to make balls for use in games and as [[:Category:Toys|children's toys]].{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 3}}\n\nIn [[Maztica]], rubber was most notably used to make the hard, {{SIAdj|6|inch|c|long-yes|adj=diameter}} balls for use in the Maztican [[ball game]], as well as to make the soles of [[sandal]]s used in playing that game.",
            "Apparel": "Rubber was used to fashion [[Mask (object)|masks]] and curvy [[corset]]s.{{Cite web/Ladies Night at the Yawning Portal}} At the [[Baths (Arabel)|Baths]] in [[Arabel]], hedonistic revelries sometimes included pink rubber [[dragon]] costumes.\n\nIn Waterdeep, rubber [[boots]] were not unheard of as part of a miner's outfit.",
            "Tools and Equipment": "Bouncy rubber balls were considered a useful tool for finding and neutralizing common [[trap]]s, and trap-wary [[adventurer]]s might be advised to carry several of them. Such a ball was simply thrown down a [[dungeon]] corridor and allowed to bounce and roll around, triggering traps or at least allowing the thrower to listen to the ball for information about the path ahead.\n\nRubber was useful for enhancing training environments and obstacle courses. Mock pit traps might include [[net]]s of rubber cords to catch and bounce fallen trainees,{{Cite dragon/64/The Assassins' Run|36}} while rubber [[paint-bomb dart]]s could be fired by [[bow]] to non-lethally hit and mark a target.{{Cite dragon/64/The Assassins' Run|34}} Such features were used in the [[Assassin's Run]] of Waterdeep.\n\nIn [[Ankhapur]], the [[Vorbel wagon wheel]] was a major trade product, which sometimes featured a layer of rubber wrapped around the rim.\n\nIn Maztica, rubber strips were sometimes used to weave [[hammock]]s and the like.\n\nIn [[Ravens Bluff]], rubber was used in the construction of [[slaker (tool)|slaker]]s, specialized flasks designed to extinguish fires. These were used by the [[Red Ravens (Ravens Bluff)|Red Ravens]] fire brigade as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/70/The Living City: The Red Ravens|27}}\n\nOn [[spelljammer]]s, rubber was sometimes used as a material for floor mats.{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|61}}",
            "Plugs and Seals": "Some [[vial]]s made use of rubber stoppers. An [[assassin]] could store [[poison]] in such a vial and simply poke or stab a weapon through the rubber in order to apply the poison without having to open the whole vial.\n\nNatural rubber might be mixed with [[gorgon]] blood to seal the interior of items like ''[[dead box]]es'' in order to disrupt detection magic.\n\nIn [[Durpar]], rubber was sometimes used to coat realistic [[prosthetic]]s, such as those sold by [[Orviir Kalgalast]].{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/So What Do Ye Do for a Living?}}\n\nIn [[Zakhara]], rubber plugs were sometimes used to stop drains in baths and pools.{{Cite dungeon/57/The Rose Of Jumlat|45}}",
            "Magic": "Rubber served as a [[material component]] in several [[spell]]s, including ''[[afterclap]]'', ''[[deadly dance]]'', ''[[erase]]'', ''[[false face]]'', ''[[insulation]]'' ''[[lightning shield]]'',{{Cite dragon/203/Arcane Lore: The Blue Books of Othyisar Du'Morde|36}} ''[[sacrosanct]]'', ''[[tentacle of withering]]'', and ''[[translocation shift]]''.{{Cite dragon/219/The Wizards Three: Warmer Than Expected|97-98}}\n\nSome versions of the ''[[wand of wonder]]'' could conjure hundreds of permanent rubber balls that rained down around the wielder."
        },
        "Production": "Rubber was produced using the congealed snd cured sap of the rubber tree.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|31}} This sap was melted and molded into usable shapes or sculpted into objects.\n\nRubber was known and used in Faer没n since at least the time of ancient [[Netheril]]. and was cultivated as an agricultural product by the tribes of Malatra. Rubber was also imported to Faer没n from Maztica."
