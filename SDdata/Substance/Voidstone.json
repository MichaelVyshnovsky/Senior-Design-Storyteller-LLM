        "mainbody": "Voidstone was a solid substance that originated on the Negative Energy Plane and destroyed anything it touched.\nCompletely black and featureless, voidstone was nearly unmeasurable by any known means. Rough estimates of size could be made by the black hole it formed in any region of illumination. Size could range from a few inches to dozens of feet in any dimension. Any material touching it, other than another voidstone, was quickly destroyed in a matter of seconds&mdasha being with great fortitude might last a little longer. Telekinesis or other forms of mental control did not work on voidstones. Some voidstones were attracted to life the medium-sized chunks would move in the direction of the nearest living creature while the very small and very large pieces remained motionless. Voidstones showed no reaction to undead.\nNo means of creating voidstone were known. It formed naturally on the Negative Energy Plane in major negative-dominant areas when the ebb and flow of the energy tides caused an intense concentration of negative energy, creating seemingly stable chunks of voidstone. Qarlynd Melarn mentioned that voidstone was a solidified piece of the Negative Material Plane.\nThere is speculation that voidstone was the basis for the creation of spheres of annihilation because of the similar destructive nature and utterly black appearance, but proof of an actual connection remains elusive."
