        "Description": {
            "Properties": "Whenever a [[magic]]al [[spell]] or spell-like ability struck an item forged from mithral the results were somewhat unpredictable. Seemingly half the time this occurred, the individual in possession of the mithral item became partially and temporarily protected from magic's harmful effects."
        },
        "Uses": "[[File:Mithral.png|thumb|''A slab of mithral.'']]\nItems cast from mithral weighed only half as much as similar items forged from steel. Since pieces of [[armor]] made from this valuable metal were very light, they allowed the wearer to make better use of their natural agility and were less restrictive on spellcasting.",
        "Rumors and legends": "Among some [[bard]]ic circles it was said that mithral combined with [[steel]] could create [[adamantine]], but according to [[dwarves]] this claim was laughable."
