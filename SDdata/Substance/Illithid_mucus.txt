Illithid mucous was just that, a mucous that was naturally secreted by illithids by glands located below the dermis layer of their skin.
This variety of mucous gave off a faint odor similar to onions, garlic, or even vanilla, although the smell was imperceptible from afar.
The most noteworthy feature of illithid mucous was its faint active psionic properties. Some sages theorized this mucous enhanced the innate psionic abilities of illithids, reduced the mental strain of psychoportation, and provided them their magic resistance. It was further conjectured that, if true, this meant loss of mucous would cause an illithids psionic powers and magic resistances to dampen.
Besides its psionic properties, illithid mucous was notably one of the few materials resistant to the corrosive enzyme produced by illithid tentacles.
* Non-illithid beings were mostly unaware of the psionic properties of illithid mucous, though some human mages were said to have developed formulas for potions of ESP that used it as an ingredient.
* Coating a weapon in illithid mucous could imbue it with offensive psionic energy.
* Illithids researched various methods by which they could use excess mucous to create psionic items, in part by means of the discipline known as imprint psionic circuitry.
* Illithids used their mucous in conjunction with a type of fungus found in the Underdark to create Nyraala golems.
* An oil of magic resistance could be derived from illithid mucous.
In the late 15 century DR, a group of adventurers traveling in and around Neverwinter found vials of illithid mucous within the Tarmalune Trade House and later harvested some themselves while adventuring in the vaults of Gauntlgrym.
