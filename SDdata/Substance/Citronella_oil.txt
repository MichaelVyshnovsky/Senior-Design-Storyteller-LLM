Citronella was an aromatic plant oil used in rituals and medical treatments.
Auroras Emporium sold citronella for 7 sp per , meant for priests to use as an aromatic ritual reagent. Insect-repelling citronella candles were also sold there for 3 gp per dozen.
Citronella oil could be used to make candles that acted as an insect repellent, similar to oil of pennyroyal. It could also mask odors and scents to avoid being tracked, by scattering the pungent oil about.
Citronella oil could be used to make magical candles whose flame could imbue arrows with flame arrow. A certain magically-imbued oil of citronella could be used to temporarily improve the users personal charisma and magnetism.
