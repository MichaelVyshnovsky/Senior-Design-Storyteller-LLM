Unholy water, in contrast, was imbued with negative energy.\nHoly water acted much like acid against undead creatures and evil beings from other planes. If contained in a flask, it could be thrown as a grenade weapon against corporeal creatures, or it could be splashed or poured on incorporeal ones. Unholy water instead damaged good outsiders.\nHoly water was used in the powerful resurrection spell, as part of the ceremony to restore life to the dead.\nSome users employed an instrument known as an aspergillum to spray holy water. A larger version of an aspergillum, the heavy aspergillum, was also used as a weapon.\nTo create a flask of holy water required the flask of water, five pounds (2.3 kilograms) of powdered silver, and the ability to bless water. The process took one minute per flask. The procedure was equivalent for unholy water, except that the water was cursed instead.\nTemples dedicated to good deities usually sold holy water at cost to those who needed a defense against evil.\nElven holy water was blessed by the god Rillifane Rallathil and often used when fighting against vampires.\n* Lessa Amyselnar, a priestess of Tymora.\n* Brianna Burdun, a priestess of Hiatea.\nThe plane of Celestia was said to contain an infinitely large sea of holy water from which Mount Celestia emerged."
