'''Blood rock''' was a rare, [[magic]]al variety of stone that would form at areas where great violence was committed, such as the site of a great slaughter, a site of ceremonial sacrifices, or the site of an ancient battlefield.

==Properties==
This stone was charged with [[Necrotic energy|necromantic energy]], or what some described as being the very essence of war and violence. Its name was derived from the mineral streaks that ran through it, which were blood red in coloration.

When carried around, blood rocks did not impart any special benefits. But when one stood upon it, a creature had a far greater chance of inflicting a significant wound upon a foe, making weapons strike harder and claws tear deeper than they would otherwise.

A creature that died upon blood rock would have its life force pulled at by the necromantic energies that suffused it. This led to all fluids in a corpse quickly draining, leaving it as a shriveled husk within a matter of a few days.

==Habitats==
Blood rock naturally occurred on some [[Outer Planes]]. It could be found in parts of the [[Elemental Chaos]].<ref> And on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]], it could be found in parts of the [[Thunder Peaks]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Escape from Sembia|10}} and in some of the rubble of the [[Spellgard]] ruins.<ref>

==Usage==
If extracted, blood rock could be used to infuse the earth or stone of another location with the same violent essence it gave off. For every {{SI|5|sq. ft|long=yes}} of area that one wished to deliberately seed with blood rock, {{SI|5|lb|k|long=yes}} of the material was required. Once set, it took a period of 48 hours or more before the presence of blood rock would permeate the area.
