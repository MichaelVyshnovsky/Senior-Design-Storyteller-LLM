        "Description": "''Moonfire'' was formed as a product of certain rituals conducted by the [[church of Selûne|Selûnite clergy]]. If the goddess was pleased by a ceremony, she bathed the milk or wine (or its combination''[[Magic of Faerûn]]'', page 17, has the Mystery of the Night ritual be a precursor to producing ''moonfire''. However, while the prior sources discuss ''moonfire'' immediately after the Mystery of the Night, it is not necessarily the case that the Mystery produces ''moonfire''. Instead, the conditions described for creating ''moonfire'' are the same as those of the night stalk ritual. This article treats ''moonfire'' as potentially being produced from any ritual.",
        "Effects": "This mass of ''moonfire'' crept away from the altar to touch or envelop whatever or whoever the goddess chose with a variety of results, such as enchanting items, empowering the faithful, and destroying [[undead]].\n\nSome common magical items produced by ''moonfire'' were:\n* ''[[Moon bracers]]'',\n* ''[[Mooncloak]]'',\n* ''[[Moon mote]]'',\n* ''[[Moondraught]]'',\n* ''[[Ring of shooting stars]]'',\nas well as various magical [[shield]]s. On a typical occurrence, magic items worth a total of 5000 to 10,000 [[gold piece]]s would be created. Any remaining ''moonfire'' fell inert but was still potent and collected by the priests as ''[[moonfire salve]]'', with up to six [[jar]]s. These items were intended for use by the clergy.\n\nIn certain circumstances, mortals who were faithful to Selûne and were touched by ''moonfire'' would receive a magical power. Some common examples were:\n* ''[[Dispel magic]]'', once a month;\n* ''[[Feather fall]]'', when in moonlight or falling uncontrolled;\n* ''[[Fly]]'', one night a month, but as often and as long as needed;\n* ''[[Identify]]'', on objects touched, seven times a month;\n* [[Infravision]], for up to 30 feet (9.1 meters);\n* ''[[Locate object]]'', once a month, but with no limit on time or space;\n* ''[[Telekinesis]], once a night and with no limit on duration, but only in moonlight;\n* The power to remove a ''[[curse]]'' with a touch, once a month;\n* Immunity to injury and powers from the [[moonblade]]s of the [[elves]]; and\n* Total control over transformations for [[lycanthrope]]s of any breed for seven months.\n\n''Moonfire'' would do these things only as Selûne willed it. No-one knew of a way to force it to produce a certain result, those who tried to steal it came away empty-handed, and it disappeared when the goddess desired.",

        "History": "Once, High Initiate [[Courynna Jacerryl]] and her followers once performed a \"night stalk\" ceremony in honor of the goddess, who was pleased and produced ''moonfire''. Courynna called this a blessing, and when it touched [[Maera (cleric)|Maera's]] hands, Courynna suggested the goddess had something special planned for her. She directed her followers to gather the sacred substance."
