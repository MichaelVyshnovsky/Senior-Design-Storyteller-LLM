'''Potash''' was a manufactured substance that was widely used in the Realms.

==Availability==
Potash was widely produced around [[Faerûn]], in a process that involved soaking the ashes of wood fires.

The [[Bedine]] of [[Anauroch]] produced and exported large amounts of potash, as well as the derivative [[soap]] and [[glass]]. The processes to make these were held as secrets by certain [[Bedine]] tribes, who did not believe that wider Faerûn knew how to produce potash, glass, or soap. If an outlander professed to know such a process, they were killed to protect the "secret".

==Usages==
Potash was used in a large array of techniques, including the production of glass, soap, and textiles, including [[felt]], [[silk]], and [[menga cloth]].
