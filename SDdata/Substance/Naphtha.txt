'''Naphtha''' was a volatile and dangerous liquid [[mineral oil]] refined from [[rock oil]], mainly used in flammable weapons.

==Description==
Naphtha was a thin, translucent yellow liquid.

==Availability==
Naphtha was refined from rock oil, usually obtained from naturally-occurring [[tar pit]]s and springs beneath the ground.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/08-01 - Petroleum Oil in the Realms}}{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/04-05 - Tar Pits in the Realms}} [[Ventdiver]] [[fish]] were noted for containing rock oil in their swim bladders, making them a handy source for making naphtha.

==Usage==
Naphtha was a useful flammable agent. [[Alchemist]]s used mineral oils such as naphtha to make sticky, burning concoctions like [[alchemist's fire]], [[everburning oil]], and ''[[oil of fiery burning]]'',{{Cite dragon/334/Fires of Alchemy|47}} which could be loaded into a [[flame thrower]], or delivered alongside another flammable weapon.{{Cite dungeon/80/The Frothing Miscreant|31,37}} Naphtha could be used as part of traps that sprayed intruders with the substance, ideally followed up by them being set aflame.

Naphtha could also be used for non-fire-related purposes including being used as a solvent for cleaning and maintenance, such as stripping [[paint]], grease, and oil from materials such as wood.

The ''[[image trap]]'' spell used a figurine of the caster soaked in naphtha.{{Cite dragon/243/Arcane Lore: Traveling Spellbooks|91}}
