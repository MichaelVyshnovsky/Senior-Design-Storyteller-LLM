        "mainbody": "Tar pits were a kind of naturally-occurring sinking hazard found throughout the Realms, made up of petroleum and bitumen, a kind of oil and tar separate from common plant and animal based varieties.\nTar pits were pools of glistening black liquid, and sticky to the touch.\nTar pits usually formed when petroleum welled up from deep underground and reached the surface, forming pools of noxious, stinking black liquid If the oil emerged in swampy terrain, it poisoned the area and became a \"dead marsh\".\nThey were especially prevalent in Var, Veldorn, Ulgarth, and the nearby Utter East, in Chult, the Alimir Mountains, and on islets within the Lake of Steam. Tar pits also formed within the Underdark, as the empty space of it interrupted the upward flow of the oil towards the surface. Tunnels and caverns could be home to entire lakes of tar, depending on the geology, and were especially prevalent under the Eastern Shaar, while rivers flowed near underground volcanism.\nTar pits began appearing in Myrloch Vale in the Moonshae Isles amid the supernatural destruction caused by Bhaal in 1346 DR.\nBubbling tar pits were a common hazard in Avernus of the Nine Hells.\nThe former Netherese arcanist Sysquemalyn knew a Hellish spell that summoned up tar from the ground, forming a kind of tar pit."
