It was extremely hard and brittle due to its high [[carbon]] content, and required further work to make the wrought iron that was the commonly-used form.\n* [[Cold iron]] was a peculiar form of iron found deep underground. If carefully forged at low temperatures, it could be devastatingly deadly against [[fey]] and [[demon]]s.\n* [[Star metal]], or meteoric iron, was usually made of iron and other metals in a strong natural alloy.\n* [[Luspeel]], or lodestone, was a concentration of [[wikipedia:magnetite|magnetite]] iron ore that possessed magnetic properties that affected nearby metal objects in a non-magical manner.{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|21}}\n* [[Pyrite]] was a notable form of iron ore that closely resembled raw [[gold]], and caused prospectors great frustration.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|23}}\n\nMetals that resembled iron but were still distinctly different substances could also be found:\n* [[Infernal iron]] was found in the [[Nine Hells]].\n* [[Blackiron]] was a strong, dark metal that resembled iron.\n* [[Titansteel]] was a light, resilient metal also known as relic iron.",

            "Refining": "[[File:BlackDwarfMine-furnace.jpg|thumb|200px|''The iron smelter of [[Black Dwarf Mine]].'']]\nIron ore was refined by laborious and filthy efforts at a bloomery furnace.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}} One method involved dumping a layer of raw ore into a vertical furnace fed by forcefully pumped air, followed by a layer of [[limestone]] [[flux]] and then fuel such as [[charcoal]], [[coal]], or [[coke]], then repeated until its own weight threatened to crush the burning coals. The limestone would bind with the non-metallic substance of the ore, separating from the iron into glassy [[slag]] tailings. As the ore melted, it would run to the bottom of the furnace and flow out into a [[crucible]] called the \"hearth\" where the slag would separate and float to the top, allowing it to be raked off and separated from the pure iron. The liquid iron was then poured into a series of channels dug into [[sand]], the main \"sow\" channel lined with numerous \"pig\" cavities. After the sow and pigs solidified, they were broken apart with [[hammer]]s and pulled out with [[hook]]s, clearing the channels for future castings. Alternatively, the iron could be poured into [[clay]] moulds that made specific products such as [[pot]]s and [[pan]]s, or into a clay-lined casting [[ladle]] that could dispense iron into smaller, more delicate project moulds.\n\nThe pig iron would then be further processed into wrought iron, the common form of worked iron. In this process the pig iron was purified of the excess carbon in charcoal fireboxes, making it more malleable and resilient.",
            "Mining & Trade": "[[File:Gracklstugh.jpg|thumb|280px|''Gracklstugh, the City of Blades, never stopped forging.'']]\n* The [[Frozenfar]] was famously rich in all manner of mineral wealth, including iron. The largest known iron deposit in Faerûn lay below [[Ironmaster]], a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] settlement dedicated to the mining and smelting of iron, refined into pots, pans, and forge bars that were then exported through [[Fireshear]] and [[Mirabar]]. In the [[Underdark]] nearby, the dwarven city of [[Hammerkeep]] in the [[Underdark]] possessed mines of pure native iron, though long lost to [[drow]] and [[derro]].{{Cite dungeon/20/The Ship of Night|16,19}}\n* The [[Silver Marches]] were rich in minerals, especially iron, gold, silver, and copper. On the edge of the [[Evermoors]], natural clefts near [[Nesmé]] yielded much easily-accessible iron, leading to the town having a dedicated ironworking industry. The village of [[Auvandell]] near [[Sundabar]] supplied the city with iron, copper, and lead, and the folk of [[Deadsnows]] mined iron, copper, and silver from the nearby [[Nether Mountains]]. To the north, the [[orc]]s of [[Dark Arrow Keep]] mined plentiful iron from deeper in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains.{{Cite dragon/429/History Check: Dark Arrow Keep|5}}\n* In the [[Northdark]], the [[duergar]] city of [[Gracklstugh]] processed huge amounts of iron, using [[Themberchaud]]'s fiery breath to heat their forges. Elsewhere in the Northdark, the [[earth node]] [[Nuur Throth]] was a gigantic black iron lode.\n* The [[Star Mounts]] in the [[High Forest]] had remarkably pure iron and [[nickel]] deposits that were mined by the elves of [[Eaerlann]], but since the fall of the realm it went untouched.\n* On the [[Sword Coast]], [[Leilon]] mined iron, copper, nickel, and silver from the [[Sword Mountains]]. The metals were bought at a cheap price by Waterdhavian merchants who then exported it from the city.{{Cite dungeon/15/The Glass House|38}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-05-08 - Sword Mountains Metals}}\n* Beneath [[Waterdeep]] in the [[Deep Mines]] of [[Undermountain]], the duergar mined [[mithral]] and iron, the latest group led by prince [[Valtagar Steelshadow]]. A few miles west of Waterdeep, the [[Black Dwarf Mine]] exploited a very pure vein of iron ore, with [[Aldurghen Stormhammer]] and his crew mining and forging the metal.{{Cite dragon/316/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Black Dwarf Mine|74-77}}\n* The [[granite]] [[Serpent Hills]] had rich deposits of iron, silver, [[salt]], and [[marble]].[[File:BlackDwarfMine-tongs.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Black Dwarf Mine dwarves forging iron.'']]\n* In the [[Moonshae Isles]], [[Moray]] exported iron ore, while [[Callidyrr]] was a prominent center of iron mining and ironworking. One of the minining settlements in the [[Fairheight Range]] was [[Blackstone]], source of some of the highest-quality iron in [[Faerûn]]. Nearby, the [[Northlander]] settlement of [[Gnarhelm (city)|Gnarhelm]] also mined the Range.\n* In [[Amn]], the mines of [[Nashkel]] supplied iron to the entire region. [[Eshpurta]] was a center of metalworking and forged a great deal of iron, and was supplied by nearby iron and [[nickel]] mines in the [[Troll Mountains (Amn)|Troll Mountains]]. The [[Gulf of Storms]] in the same mountains was a crystal- and iron-studded cleft that seemed to attract lightning bolts, and was actually a temple of [[Talos]].\n* In the desert of [[Anauroch]], [[Aerithae's Rest]] in the [[Plain of Standing Stones]] had surface iron deposits that could be easily harvested with a hammer.\n* [[Orc]] tribes mined iron in the [[Goblin Marches]] and [[Stonelands]], using it to supply their own weapons and armor.\n* [[Cormyr]]ean mines in the [[Storm Horns]] at [[Old Axe]] and [[Skull Crag]] provided good amounts of iron.\n* The [[Dalelands]] were generally poor in iron and other metals. [[Tasseldale]] harvested a small amount of iron ore from the depths of [[Glaun Bog]], discovered by the [[human]] blacksmith [[Glaun]].\n* The hills south of the [[Tangled Forest]] in the [[Cormanthor]] had deposits of iron that supported the unorthodox diets of introduced [[aurumvorax]].\n* On the [[Moonsea]], [[Mulmaster]] was the largest single exporter of iron, with the city perpetually shadowed by the foundry smoke. Nearby [[Point Iron]] was a fair iron mine, though it was seized by duergar from below. Further west, [[Ironfang Keep]] sat atop and was surrounded by rich iron deposits, though the mystery and danger of the site kept any prospectors away.\n* The [[Galena Mountains]] in [[northeast Faerûn]] were rich in iron ore, and [[human]]s and [[dwarves]] established mining communities there. Iron ore was exported from nearby [[Glister]], along with [[silver]] and [[copper]].\n* [[Chult]] had great mineral wealth, with iron among it.{{Cite web/theedverse/2018-02-01 - Minerals of Chult}} The dwarves of [[Hrakhamar]] mined and worked iron and adamantine from beneath the [[Kobold Mountains]].\n* [[Lapaliiya]] was poor in iron and was a great importer of it. One of the few mines was near the metalworking city of [[Lhazantal]], the City of Smiths.\n* In the [[Hazur Mountains]], scattered iron and [[gold]] mines were operated by [[Tashalar|Tashalaran]] humans and [[Thindol]]ese [[gold dwarves]], and also served as passages to the [[Burning Rift]] in the [[Underdark]].\n* The dwarves of the [[Great Rift]] mined and worked a great deal of metals, with ironworking centered at [[Eartheart]]. The richest mines were found at [[Glitterdelve]], where they found iron, silver, gold, [[copper]], and [[lead]], and lesser mines at [[Rimmator]] that produced iron, copper, and [[tin]].[[File:Iron Ore 2.png|thumb|''A piece of iron-bearing ore.'']]\n* [[Chessenta]] had large, untapped deposits of iron, copper, gold, and silver. The iron that it did produce was famously pure and high-quality, and was in wide demand in other lands. The nearby [[Akanapeaks]] had a good deal of iron that was mined by folk from [[Reth]] and Chessenta.\n* [[Unther]] exported a great deal of gold and iron to other regions. The volcanic [[Smoking Mountains]] were rich in iron, copper, gold, and lead, with the town of [[Dalath]] handling the mining. [[Ssintar]] performed iron and copper mining near the [[Methwood]], while [[Shussel]]'s iron mines suffered from depletion.\n* [[Mulhorand]], [[Aglarond]], and the [[Great Dale]] had to import iron to support their needs.\n* In [[Damara]], the receding [[Great Glacier]] revealed the old dwarven mines of [[Delhalls]] and [[Talagbar]], containing a profusion of mineral wealth including iron.\n* [[Impiltur]]an humans and dwarves mined iron and other minerals from the [[Earthfast Mountains]], exporting it to other realms.\n* [[Thesk]] exported iron to other realms, primarily from the [[Dragonjaw Mountains]], inhabited by [[gnome]]s that mined some copper and iron and a great deal of gems, while the [[Thesk Mountains]] were inhabited by [[orc]]s who primarily mined iron for themselves. The dwarven realm of [[Ahruukar]] mined iron and hematite from beneath the Thesk Mountains, and exported the finished goods.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Lost Dwarven Kingdoms}}\n* [[Rashemen]] was quite iron-poor, with the [[duergar]] of [[Darzalstaukh]] competing with the surfacers for the limited sources. The land's most significant source of minerals were the [[Mines of Tethkel]] that provided a small but steady amount of iron.\n* [[Solon]] in the [[Plains of Purple Dust]] was once famed for its iron mines, and they remained untapped after the city's abandonment.\n* In the [[Shining Lands]], iron was found in the surrounding mountains. In [[Durpar]], the [[Dustwall Mountains]] were extremely rich in iron but almost entirely populated by hostile orcs, with ambitious dwarven expeditions managing to mine significant amounts. [[Adama's Tooth]] also had had fine iron and copper deposits, with the city of [[Sezilinta]] taking ore from the Tooth and [[Giant's Belt Mountains]] to be worked and exported. The [[Gwarlor chaka]] of [[Flyndagol]] and [[Yanama chaka]] of [[Morvrar]] were particularly invested in iron mining and working. In [[Ulgarth]], gold and iron was taken from the [[Galuil Mountains]] through [[Surbar]] and [[Orvyltar]].\n* The [[Peqqir]] people mined the [[Koryaz Mountains]] for iron and [[jade]].\n* In [[Wa]], [[Rukimbaru]] had iron mines that supplemented its economy.\n* The arid plains of [[Ma' Yuan]] supplied [[Shou Lung]] with much of its iron, [[salt]], and other metals.\n* [[Balanzia]] in [[T'u Lung]] was a center of trade, including iron and steelwork. The [[Imperial Wai Mines]] on the north edge of the [[Hills of Quai]] mined iron, gold, and copper using slave labor."

As the mines were worked out, the empty tunnels were used for magical research and secure storage. Despite their wealth and knowledge, a focus on magical enhancement over metallurgical techniques meant that the civilization made little progress, and advanced ironworking and steelmaking was never achieved.\n\nThe Netherese city of [[Scourge (city)|Scourge]] suffered from a strange environmental condition, as the salty wind blowing off the [[Narrow Sea]] rusted metal at an extraordinary rate, including magical items. The land around the city was even home to inordinate amounts of [[rust monster]]s. In {{yearlinkConvert|1754|NY}}, the city came under attack from [[Shining Tooth]] clan [[goblin]]s, whose assault was shattered in part due to their metal weapons breaking.\n\nThe Netherese successor kingdom of [[Anauria]] was able to supply itself with iron and tin, but didn't have any copper and zinc.\n\nBefore the existence of [[Tethyr]], dwarves delved around what would become [[Velen]], finding a little iron ore but not enough to justify settlement.{{Cite dungeon/54/The Fiends of Tethyr|23,24}}\n\n[[Keczulla]] in [[Amn]] was founded in [[575 DR]] by the [[Kczull]] family during a gold rush that also found iron deposits there.
