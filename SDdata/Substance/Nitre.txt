'''Nitre''', also known as '''saltpeter''',{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|62}} was a common form of [[salt]] in the Realms.

==Description==
This substance could be burned, but on [[Toril]] it would not combust.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-24 - Gunpowder Mechanics and Smokepowder Origins}}

==Nitre Deposits in the Realms==
* [[Mount Hotenow]].

==Usages==
* Many within the Realms used nitre for curing meats.
* Nitre was sometimes used in the distillation of caustic liquids. For instance, it could be distilled with [[alum]] and [[oil of vitriol]] to create the substance [[aqua fortis]]. It could also be distilled with aqua fortis and [[sal ammoniac]] to create [[aqua regia]].
* This substance could be mixed with [[charcoal]] and [[sulfur]] to create a substance known as [[gunpowder]].{{Cite dragon/60/Firearms|26}}
* The [[alchemist]] [[Surero]] claimed to use a combination of 75% sulfur, 10% saltpeter and 15% charcoal mixed together in sacks to create the alchemical substance [[smokepowder]].<ref><ref group="note">It should be noted though that Ed Greenwood stated in one [https://web.archive.org/web/20210517004301/https://twitter.com/jvcparry/status/867391458827005953 tweet] that smokepowder had completely different ingredients from gunpowder. Though in actuality, this recipe required precise proportions of a secret, [[magic]]al ingredient to result in working smokepowder.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}}
