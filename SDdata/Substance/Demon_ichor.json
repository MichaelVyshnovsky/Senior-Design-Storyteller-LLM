If it came into contact with certain beings, aside from fiends, plants, and undead, demonic ichor could change their physical properties. Changes included increasing or decreasing in size, either wholly or a single appendage the growth of eyes, horns, or a tail or something as simple as a new hair color.\nMany devils and other fiendish creatures used demon ichor for certain rituals or as a means to improve their infernal war machines.\nStill others used it as a coating for their weapons. It also acted as a poison that caused weakness.\n* Spiritwrack required demon ichor as a material component."
