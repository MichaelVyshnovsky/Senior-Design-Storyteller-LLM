        "mainbody": "amite was a type of luxury fabric found in the Realms.\nThis type of fabric was thick and woven from high-quality threads of silk and golden thread.\nIn 1358 DR, samite was among the many fabrics that Hlethvagi Anteos kept within crates in their storeroom on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.\nSamite was used to weave a wide variety of products. These included caps, robes, rugs, sashes, and surcoats.\n* This fabric was considered such a luxury item that some nations outlawed the wearing of samite clothing by all but members of high society.\n* Camels of the Pearl were often outfitted with riding tack, such as bridles and saddles, that were made with samite.\n* The shair Akim al-Kalaas typically wore either dark green or maroon robes that were made of samite and silk.\n* In the City of Brass, the Palazzo of the Blue Horse had brocade cushions in its dining hall that were made of samite.\n* In the mid-14 century DR, samite was among the many fabrics that one could be found used in Waterdeep for fine fabrics."
