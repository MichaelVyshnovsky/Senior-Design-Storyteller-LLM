        "mainbody": "ivine miasma was a magical substance extracted from remnants of dead gods found floating in the Astral Plane.\nEven the smallest shards of bones from dead deities giant bodies floating in the Astral Sea sent hairs on the mortals arms stand from the divinity contained inside. When refined through alchemical extraction, these shards produced thick substance called divine miasma. Its power made creatures near it feel safe on a strange instinctual level.\nVitriol of divine miasma was a valuable alchemical component. When combined with certain types of sublimates, it created elixirs of universal resistance â€“ a magic potion that made the imbiber resistant to all mundane and magical harm for a period of time."
