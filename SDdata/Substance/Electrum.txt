}}'''Electrum''' was a naturally occurring [[silver]]-[[gold]] alloy

==Value and terminology==
Most of Faerûn used "standard rates of exchange for coinage," based on the silver and gold standard, with 1&nbsp;cp worth 1/100&nbsp;gp, 1&nbsp;sp worth 1/10&nbsp;gp, 1&nbsp;ep worth 1/2&nbsp;gp, and 1&nbsp;pp worth 10&nbsp;gp..

Electrum coins adopted various names throughout the Realms.
* [[Amn]] minted coins called ''centaurs'' or ''decimes''
* [[Calimport]] minted ''centarches'', ''tazos'', or ''zonths''
* [[Cormanthyr]] minted ''thammarchs''
* [[Cormyr]] minted ''blue eyes''
* [[Sembia]] minted electrum coins called ''harmarks'' or ''electrums''
** For a time, [[Sembia]] evidently went off the silver and gold standard, and they minted electrum coins called ''blue eyes'', valued at 5&nbsp;gp apiece
* [[Waterdeep]] minted ''moons'', or ''harbor moons''
* [[Silverymoon]] minted special coins called ''electrum moons''

Throughout the [[Western Heartlands]], most electrum coins from abroad were called ''blue eyes'' regardless of origin.

There are two special coins valued more within the city they were minted in:
* The original shining blue crescent-shaped [[moon (coin)|''electrum moon'']] of [[Silverymoon]], a coin worth 1&nbsp;ep throughout the Realms but twice that within the city itself.

* The ''[[harbor moon]]'' of [[Waterdeep]], a cresent shaped Waterdhavian coin made of platinum, inset with electrum, and punched with a central hole. It was used for bulk transactions, one coin being worth 50&nbsp;gp within the city of Waterdeep anywhere else.

Electrum currency was generally rare and not available in the [[Land of Fate]].

==Other uses==
The spell ''[[Khelben]]'s warding whip'' used a pinch of powdered electrum as a material component.

The spell ''[[Leomund secret chest]]'' could use a chest fashioned from bronze, copper, or silver with fittings of electrum or silver.

Magical [[morning star]]s known as ''[[storm star]]''s were crafted from electrum-plated steel. They could unleash a ''[[chain lightning]]'' effect.

An electrum mounting allowed [[witherite]] to be worn as a protection to necromantic attacks.<ref>

Two notable tomes—''The [[Chambeeleon]]'' and ''The [[Tome of the Unicorn]]''—had electrum pages, with the latter also having electrum covers.

If one of the twisted bands of a ''[[shoonring]]'' was made of electrum, this usually indicated that the ring contained multiple powers and enhanced the effects of the magics involved.
