Electrum was a naturally occurring silver-gold alloy
Most of Faerûn used "standard rates of exchange for coinage," based on the silver and gold standard, with 1&nbspcp worth 1/100&nbspgp, 1&nbspsp worth 1/10&nbspgp, 1&nbspep worth 1/2&nbspgp, and 1&nbsppp worth 10&nbspgp..
Electrum coins adopted various names throughout the Realms.
* Amn minted coins called centaurs or decimes
* Calimport minted centarches, tazos, or zonths
* Cormanthyr minted thammarchs
* Cormyr minted blue eyes
* Sembia minted electrum coins called harmarks or electrums
** For a time, Sembia evidently went off the silver and gold standard, and they minted electrum coins called blue eyes, valued at 5&nbspgp apiece
* Waterdeep minted moons, or harbor moons
* Silverymoon minted special coins called electrum moons
Throughout the Western Heartlands, most electrum coins from abroad were called blue eyes regardless of origin.
There are two special coins valued more within the city they were minted in
* The original shining blue crescent-shaped electrum moon of Silverymoon, a coin worth 1&nbspep throughout the Realms but twice that within the city itself.
* The harbor moon of Waterdeep, a cresent shaped Waterdhavian coin made of platinum, inset with electrum, and punched with a central hole. It was used for bulk transactions, one coin being worth 50&nbspgp within the city of Waterdeep anywhere else.
Electrum currency was generally rare and not available in the Land of Fate.
