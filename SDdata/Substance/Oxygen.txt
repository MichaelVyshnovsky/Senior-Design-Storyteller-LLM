'''Oxygen''' was an important elemental gas found in the [[Realms]].

==Availability==
In {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}, the [[Elemental Store]] of [[Karsus Enclave]] sold pure elemental oxygen gas for 2 [[gp]] per {{SI|1|cubic foot|l|long=yes}}.

==Usages==
* Living creatures ostensibly used oxygen in the air to stay alive, with the amount consumed based on the size of the creature and their level of exertion. Fire consumed it and could choke out confined spaces, and [[poison]]ous gases inflicted great harm upon those who sought to inhale oxygen. [[Spelljammer]]s carried oxygen with them in their [[air envelope]], allowing their crew to breathe.
* Oxygen was used as a [[material component]] for [[magic]] related to breathing.
