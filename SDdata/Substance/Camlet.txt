Camlet was a heavy and expensive form of fabric in the Realms, made from the hairs of camels.
In 1358 DR, camlet was among the many fabrics that Hlethvagi Anteos kept within crates in their storeroom on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.
* In the mid-14 century DR, camlet was among the many fabrics that one could be found used in Waterdeep for fine fabrics.
