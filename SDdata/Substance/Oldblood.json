        "Price": "The price of this dye was typically rather expensive, due to it being rather difficult and time-consuming to gather enough snails for a good batch.",
        "Creation": "This dye was produced by exposing the secretions of hunting knight sails to [[the sun|sunlight]]. Several species across the seas of [[Toril]] could be used for this purpose.\n\nTypically large numbers of hunting knight snails were gathered and crushed in order to form a batch of this dye, but as population numbers declined due to overhunting people would resort to instead keeping the snails alive and milking them. This took a lot of work and was usually done by young or aging members of fisherfolk families."
