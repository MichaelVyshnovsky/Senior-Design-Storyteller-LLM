The Church of Urogalan believed that these masks aided the dead spirits in their adjustment to afterlife. Some fanciful terra cotta funeral masks were decorated with bronze filigree and decorated with gems in place of eyes.\nIn the city of Myth Drannor, terra cotta was used to create diminutive magically animated constructs, the clay warriors, who were placed inside crypts of military heroes of the City of Song to represent the troops they commanded in life and to protect their tombs from grave robbers.\nMany of the rooftops of Ankhapur in the Lake of Steam, were covered in terra-cotta shingles and tiles, protecting the structures from rainfall. The shingles clacked loudly when stepped upon, laking the lives of burglars much harder then in other cities of the realms.\nOn the Island of Viledel, Korinn Archipelago, the islands ruler owned a lavish terra-cotta bath tub that outlived Viledel and his family.\nIn Chult, the Tomb of the Nine Gods, was guarded by forty eight magically animated terracotta warriors. These constructs guarded Shagambis part of the tomb and were activated by loud noise of intruders.\nIn 1369 DR a group of heroes who opposed the Cult of the Dragon occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, came across an army of terra cotta constructs, clay warrior, who guarded Lyssics Crypt in Polyandrium. Evident by some of the statues shattered and several bodies, these constructs were a deadly swarming force."
