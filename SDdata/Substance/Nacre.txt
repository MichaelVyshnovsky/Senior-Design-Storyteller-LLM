Nacre was a precious substance that made up pearl and mother of pearl, as well as some shells.
As a precious material, nacre was distinguished from mother of pearl by its "fire luster". Like other shells, ivory, and precious metals, nacre was used for decorative inlays on artistic objects.
* Giant clams were lined with mother of pearl and nacre, as their smaller cousins were.
* Turbo and trochus shells contained mother of pearl and nacre.
