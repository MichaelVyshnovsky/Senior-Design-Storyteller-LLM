Samite was a type of luxury fabric found in the Realms.
This type of fabric was thick and woven from high-quality threads of silk and golden thread.
In 1358 DR, samite was among the many fabrics that Hlethvagi Anteos kept within crates in their storeroom on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.
Samite was used to weave a wide variety of products. These included caps, robes, rugs, sashes, and surcoats.
