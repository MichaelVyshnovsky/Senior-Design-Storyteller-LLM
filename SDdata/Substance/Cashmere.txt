Cashmere was a tough yet soft, luxurious textile found in the Realms, produced from cashmere thread made out of highly prized eastern cashmere goats wool.
Cashmere gained popularity in Neverwinter in the late 15 century DR.
Cashmere threads were woven from cashmere wool and treated with oil of vitriol.
Cashmere wool was used to line aberrant leather clothing and armor, Calishite saddles, expensive upholstery, clothing, sashes, and rugs. Snowhare yarn was also weaved using cashmere wool, in part.
An enchanted variety called cashmere spellthread was made by treating cashmere thread with a magical substance called concentrated residuum. This high-quality cashmere helped in channeling enchantments.
* Atreus Eleint, a 14 century DR warrior from the Utter East, wore a cape of brocaded cashmere.
