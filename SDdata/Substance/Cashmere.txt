'''Cashmere''' was a tough yet soft, luxurious textile found in the [[Realms]], produced from cashmere thread made out of highly prized eastern [[cashmere goat]]s' [[wool]].

==Availability==
Cashmere gained popularity in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Creation==
Cashmere threads were woven from cashmere wool and treated with ''[[oil of vitriol]]''.

==Usage==
Cashmere wool was used to line [[aberrant leather]] clothing and [[armor]], [[Calishite]] [[saddle]]s, expensive upholstery, clothing, [[sash]]es, and rugs. [[Snowhare]] yarn was also weaved using cashmere wool, in part.

An [[enchanted]] variety called cashmere spellthread was made by treating cashmere thread with a magical substance called concentrated ''[[residuum]]''. This high-quality cashmere helped in channeling enchantments.

==Notable Users==
* [[Atreus Eleint]], a 14{{th}} century DR [[warrior]] from the [[Utter East]], wore a [[cape]] of brocaded cashmere.{{Cite dragon annual/1998/Rogues Gallery: Faces of Deception|113}}
