'''Everdark ink''', frequently called just '''everdark''', was a highly valuable magical [[ink]] used by [[drow]] [[mage]]s.

==Description==
The liquid had the strongest magical properties of all known inks. The drow [[wizard]]s used it to draw [[Drow rune|glyphs]], which amplified their effects in comparison to ones created with more mundane fluids.

The exact formula for creating everdark was a tightly guarded secret by a select few drow Houses in the cities of the [[Underdark]]. It is certain however, that part of the production process involved dissolving [[deep dragon]] scales in [[acid]]. It was known to be produced in [[Ched Nasad]] and [[Menzoberranzan]].
