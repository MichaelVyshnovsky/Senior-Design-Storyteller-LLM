Everdark ink, frequently called just everdark, was a highly valuable magical ink used by drow mages.
The liquid had the strongest magical properties of all known inks. The drow wizards used it to draw glyphs, which amplified their effects in comparison to ones created with more mundane fluids.
The exact formula for creating everdark was a tightly guarded secret by a select few drow Houses in the cities of the Underdark. It is certain however, that part of the production process involved dissolving deep dragon scales in acid. It was known to be produced in Ched Nasad and Menzoberranzan.
