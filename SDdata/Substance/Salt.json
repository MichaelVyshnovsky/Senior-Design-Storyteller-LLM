A common method was pouring the water across a flat surface and letting the water evaporate. It was harvested from a wide variety of sources in the Realms:\n* The [[Flooded Forest]] between [[the Vast]] and [[Moonsea]] regions.\n* The [[Adder Swamp]] in [[Chessenta]] was difficult to access, but gave Chessenta a sizable salt export.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|69}}\n* The [[Spider Swamp]] in [[Calimshan]].\n* The [[Great Swamp of Rethild]] in the [[Shining South]].\n* A tributary of the [[Deeping Stream]] in [[Featherdale]] infused with mineral salt was harvested by boiling the water.\n* The water from bogs beneath the salt pans of the [[the Sword]] could be harvested for salt, though it was difficult and risky.\n* The lakes fed by the [[Anai River]] in the [[Plain of Horses]] were harvested for salt, especially [[Lake Gusang]], with each lakebed's minerals producing a different color.\n* The [[Dwyvach Salt Flats]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n* The [[Moonsea]] provided a unique salt.\n\nSalt could also be found as naturally forming chunks on the shores of extremely salty bodies of water.\n* [[Lake of Salt|Azulduth, the Lake of Salt]], near [[Mulhorand]].\n* The [[Lake of Steam]] in [[southern Faerûn]].\n* [[Lake Lhespen]] in the [[Shaar]] had several communities that harvested from it.\n* Volcanic hot springs could produce special kinds of salt.\n\n[[File:ME-Salt.png|thumb|200px|''A small heap of salt.'']]\nSalt pans on the site of dried-up lakes and inland seas were also a source of salt:\n* The [[Anauroch]] desert had many salt pans that were mined by the [[Bedine]], especially in [[the Sword]] region. The Shoal of Thirst was an especially massive salt pan, formed from the basin of [[Hidden Lake]].\n* The [[Raurin]] desert.\n* The [[Lake of Salt]] contracted in summer, revealing expansive salt flats. They were mined by locals from the towns of [[Azun]] and [[Buldamar]].\n* A [[kavir]] was a salt flat in Zakhara which was actually a crust of salt over thick black mud, making a dangerous hazard for travelers. Similar formations existed in Anauroch covering saltwater bogs.\n\nExploratory salt mines were major producers of rock salt. Underground deposits could be located by the presence of a salty spring, as groundwater combined with the salt vein.{{Cite dragon/152/In a Cavern, In a Canyon...|19}}\n* The mountains around [[Amn]]\n* The mountains of [[Calimshan]].\n* The mountains of [[Chult]].\n* The [[Korinn Archipelago]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n* The northern islands of [[Mintarn]] in the [[Sea of Swords]].\n* The [[Orsraun Mountains]].\n* The [[Whiteshell Mine]] near [[Blingdenstone]] in the [[Underdark]].\n* The mountains of [[Samarach]] in the [[Chultan Peninsula]], including [[Torich]]'s [[Mines of Selgol]].\n* The [[Serpent Hills]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

These included the [[Buried Realms]] near [[Tethyamar]], the caves of [[Deep Raurin]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 52 Khôltar, Part 3, Third Impressions}}\n* [[Lake Luo]] was surrounded by salt flats.\n* The [[Sea of Salt]] near [[Moradask]] in [[Zakhara]] was a large salt pan, but was too inhospitable to harvest.\n* The alkaline lake in the [[Pit of the Ghuls]] in [[Zakhara]] was an untapped source of many types of salt thanks to its remote location and extreme danger.\n* The [[T'hai Salt Flats]] in [[Wai]] were a salt lake that drained away, but were inaccessible thanks to the necromancer [[Utwa So]]."
