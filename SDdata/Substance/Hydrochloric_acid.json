        "mainbody": "Hydrochloric acid was a type of acid in the Realms that could be found within the stomachs of some animals.\n* Chlorine gas could be produced by dripping hydrochloric acid upon the mineral pyrolusite.\n* By mixing this substance with nitric acid, a miner was capable of dissolving gold.\n* Some hedge wizards used hydrochloric acid in various chemistry experiments.\nAround the late 14 century DR, a group of adventurers were tasked with obtaining a list of supplies for the alchemist Wendell. Among the listed ingredients was a single bottle of hydrochloric acid. When they approached the store Supreme Supplies they found a small sign on the front door that read \"Closed due to Pest Infestation\". Its owner, Syrondario, was sitting on the bench outside and quickly approached them as they got close his shop, asking them politely to avoid his shop and explaining that earlier in the day some \"clumsy oaf\" had brought in a large jar full of bookworms. The jar broke whilst they were inside and infested his shop.The adventure claims on page 11 that Syrondario is unaware that the bugs within his shop are bookworms and thus does not inform players of the danger inside. Yet on the following page its shown that he recognizes what they are, cause he knows what their value would be to the neighboring wizard.\nOnce the adventurers succeeded in their extermination duties, they were able to buy a bottle of hydrochloric acid from the store for 30 gold pieces.On the page it is referred to only as \"acid\", but considering the shopping list provided it can be assumed that this is referring to the hydrochloric acid."
