Dragons blood was an alchemically derived form of liquid gold, with no relation to actual dragons or their blood.
Dragons blood was made by dissolving gold in aqua regia. If distilled further, it created red crystals in the mixture, inspiring the evocative name.
Dragons blood was used for gilting objects, such as vellum pages, delicate metalwork, and fine fabrics. It was also used to color certain enamels and stained glass.
