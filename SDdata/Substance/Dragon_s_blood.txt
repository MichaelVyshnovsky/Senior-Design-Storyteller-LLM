'''Dragon's blood''' was an alchemically derived form of liquid [[gold]], with no relation to actual [[dragon]]s or their blood.

==Crafting==
Dragon's blood was made by dissolving gold in [[aqua regia]]. If distilled further, it created red crystals in the mixture, inspiring the evocative name.

==Usages==
Dragon's blood was used for gilting objects, such as [[vellum]] pages, delicate [[metal]]work, and fine [[fabric]]s. It was also used to color certain enamels and stained glass.
