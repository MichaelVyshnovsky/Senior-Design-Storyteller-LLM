'''Silver''' was a precious metal that was used all across [[Toril]] for a vast variety of purposes.

==Properties==
[[:Category:Shapechangers|Shapechangers]] (most notably [[lycanthrope]]s) were vulnerable to silver. [[Vampire]]s,<ref name ="MM3.5-p251"> [[Devil|devils]],<ref name ="MM3.5-p52"> [[wraith]]s, and [[wight]]s were also vulnerable to silver. Wizards from [[Aglarond]] never wore silver and were rumored to be vulnerable to silver. 

==Applications==
Silver was widely used in [[currency]], weapons, armor, jewelry and [[magical item]]s. It was sought after for its purity and beauty.

===Currency===

Silver was commonly used in the form of coins all across the realm. The shape, size, and value of these coins varied depending on the time and place that they were from.

===Weapons & Armor===
To create a silver weapon, the silver was often bonded to a [[steel]] weapon. This was a complicated process combining both [[alchemy]] and [[metallurgy]] known as alchemical silvering; this form of silver was known as '''alchemical silver''' and such a weapon was said to be "silvered". It could not be performed with non-metal items, nor with exotic metals like [[adamantine]], [[cold iron]], and [[mithral]]. However, while a silvered weapon would harm lycanthropes and other creatures vulnerable to silver, it was more fragile and a little less injurious. Silvering also cost extra, from an additional 2 gp for a projectile, 20 gp for a small weapon, 90 gp for a one-handed weapon, and 180 gp for a two-handed weapon.<ref> Temporary silvering could be applied for an hour with a vial of ''[[silversheen]]''.<ref>

The soldiers who protected the [[High Palace]] of [[Silverymoon]] wore suits of silver [[plate mail]].

===Magic Items===
Silver was often used in the production of items that related to light and moon magic.

==Treatment==
Maintaining the shine on silver required polishing with a non-abrasive cloth. [[Scalewater Carp]] were known to be particularly good at polishing silver with their mouths. These rare fish could only be found in one pond, called [[Scalewater]], on the southern edge of the [[Thunder Peaks]].

===Enchanting===
If treated magically, silver weighed as much as steel. Magically treated silver also gained a level of resistance to electricity.

==History==
Following the conquest of [[Maztica]] by [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, treasures of the shattered [[Maztican Empire]] were melted into bars and transported back to [[Faer√ªn]] as trade ingots. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Maztican silver ingots were commonly encountered along the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Nelanther Islands]].

==Notable Mines==
Silver ore was mined all across the realm, often in mountains or deep underground.
; [[Galena Mountains]]:
: As of [[1359 DR]], the iron and silver mines in the Galena Mountains were some of the richest in [[Toril]]. 
; [[Lustrum]]:
: Not long before [[1360 DR]], the drow [[House Xorlarrin]] discovered rich silver seams outside of [[Menzoberranzan]].
; [[Glitterdelve]]:
: Glitterdelve was home to the some of the richest silver, iron, and copper mines of the [[Deep Realm]].
; [[Tannath Mountains]]
: The Tannath mountains were once full of numerous silver mines. By [[1479 DR]], they were all abandoned.
; [[Fireshear]]
: The copper and silver ores of Fireshear were exposed by a volcanic eruption or meteorite. The entire town was made up of miners.
