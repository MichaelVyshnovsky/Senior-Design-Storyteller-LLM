However, while a silvered weapon would harm lycanthropes and other creatures vulnerable to silver, it was more fragile and a little less injurious. Silvering also cost extra, from an additional 2 gp for a projectile, 20 gp for a small weapon, 90 gp for a one-handed weapon, and 180 gp for a two-handed weapon. Temporary silvering could be applied for an hour with a vial of silversheen.
