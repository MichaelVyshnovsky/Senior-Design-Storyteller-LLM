'''Terracotta''', also called '''terra-cotta''' or '''terra cotta''', was a type of [[clay]]-based [[ceramic]] found throughout the Realms.

==Uses==
In [[Zakhara]], terra-cotta was used to create intricately-decorated slender urns used to store [[gold]] and jewels, and was shaped into painted figurines.

[[Hin]] followers of [[Urogalan]] and the [[Church of Urogalan]], in the [[Purple Hills]], eastern [[Amn]], the [[Sunset Vale]], and the lower [[Delimbiyr Vale]], created terra cotta burial masks that depicted the faces of deceased frozen in eternal contented expression. The Church of Urogalan believed that these masks aided the dead spirits in their adjustment to afterlife. Some fanciful terra cotta funeral masks were decorated with [[bronze]] filigree and decorated with [[gem]]s in place of eyes.

In the city of [[Myth Drannor]], terra cotta was used to create diminutive magically animated [[construct]]s, the [[clay warrior]]s, who were placed inside crypts of military heroes of the City of Song to represent the troops they commanded in life and to protect their tombs from grave robbers.

Many of the rooftops of [[Ankhapur]] in the [[Lake of Steam]], were covered in terra-cotta shingles and tiles, protecting the structures from rainfall. The shingles clacked loudly when stepped upon, laking the lives of burglars much harder then in other cities of the realms.

On the [[Island of Viledel]], [[Korinn Archipelago]], the island's ruler owned a lavish terra-cotta bath tub that outlived [[Viledel]] and his family.

In [[Chult]], the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]], was guarded by forty eight magically animated terracotta warriors. These constructs guarded [[Shagambi]]'s part of the tomb and were activated by loud noise of intruders.

==History==
In [[1369 DR]] a group of heroes who opposed the [[Cult of the Dragon]] occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, came across an army of terra cotta constructs, clay warrior, who guarded [[Lyssic's Crypt]] in [[Polyandrium]]. Evident by some of the statues shattered and several bodies, these constructs were a deadly swarming force.
