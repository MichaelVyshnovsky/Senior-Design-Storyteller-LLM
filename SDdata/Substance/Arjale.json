        "Properties": {
            "Alloying": "By alloying arjale with [[iron]], smiths were able to create a material known as dajavva. Light green-gray in color, it was particularly flexible, to the point that [[Moloch]]'s [[whip]] was crafted using this alloy.\n\nArjale could also be alloyed with [[tantulhor]] and [[silver]] to create an extremely durable yet pliable metal, of untarnished silvery color with flecks of green."

        "Applications": "Arjale was used in the creation of [[:category:magic items|magic items]] such as the [[demonshield]]s of the [[Shoon Imperium]]. It was also used to create the [[talisman]] of many [[devil]]s such as [[Agares]], [[Asmodeus]], [[Barbatos]] and [[Buer]].",
        "Production": "Arjale was mined by [[nupperibo]]s and [[spinagon]]s in [[Phlegethos]]{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|28-29}} They could also be found in [[Malbolge]] and [[Maladomini]], where it was less abundant."
