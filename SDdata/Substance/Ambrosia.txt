'''Ambrosia''' was a liquid that was the physical manifestation of pure joy. It was the only thing on which the [[tome archon]]s of [[Mount Celestia]] subsisted.

==Properties==
Ambrosia acted as a druglike substance to mortals. It worked like a soothing pain-killer and healing agent. Beyond this, it helped to quench feelings of grief and sadness for a period of up to five hours. It was not addictive. Other scholars believed that repeated consumption&mdash;a dose every one to four days&mdash;would permit a mortal to live forever.

==Applications==
Ambrosia was used as food in the layers of the Seven Heavens.

If a spellcaster were casting a fundamentally good spell using ambrosia as an optional [[material component]], the resulting spell would behave as if the spellcaster were more powerful.

Ambrosia could also be used in the creation of more common magic items, substituting for a tiny portion of the life experience usually required of the item-creator. 

==Production==
Ambrosia could be created by mere mortals by use of a [[distilled joy|magic spell]] that could be cast by both [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcasters. The spell required the caster to touch someone in the thralls of pure bliss&mdash;be it from someone hopelessly in love, deep in a happy dream, creating an artistic masterpiece, or experiencing intense sexual satisfaction. Provided the spellcaster had a vial or other small container present, the joy would materialize within the container as ambrosia.

Vials of ambrosia could be purchased for between 200 and 300 [[gold piece]]s.

==History==
After the [[Time of Troubles]], when visiting [[Oghma]] in the [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]], [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] was offered a decanter of ambrosia to drink, but she refused it.
