        "mainbody": "'''Darksteel''' was a very hard alloy of [[star metal]] created by the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Ironstar]] that could be used to forge [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] of special properties and powers. It was also known as '''''dunchalcor''''', '''dark steel''' and '''ironstar steel'''.",
        "Description": "Darksteel had a silvery hue when it was cut or polished, while its exposed surfaces bore a deep purple gleaming luster.While ''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'' states darksteel is harder and lighter than steel, ''Magic of Faerûn'' gives it the same durability and weight. If not strictly a change in rules, it may be that the rediscovered darksteel is not yet as strong or light as the old.",
        "Powers": "It had the unique power to absorb all [[magic]]al and mundane electrical energy, including lightning, without transferring a charge or effect to its bearer, without even needing to be in contact with the energy.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Thieves' Gallery}} This did not extent to heat, ''[[magic missile]]s'', or forms of pure energy.\n\nDarksteel items were resistant to damage of all kinds, being unaffected by dropping and by natural flames, cold, or electricity; resistant to acid, magical fire, crushing, and even [[Disintegrate|disintegration]]; and highly resistant to lightning.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves darksteel sparks.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''The darksteel axe shocks on contact.'']]\nA weapon forged from darksteel struck with a slight electric shock.\n\nMoreover, a darksteel item took on new [[magic]]al [[Item enchantment|enchantments]] with relative ease, no matter how many enchantments it already carried. Most notably, melting it did not ruin, and only rarely altered, any enchantments already on the metal.",
        "Creation": "It was formed from [[star metal]], that is, [[wikipedia:en:meteorite|meteoric]] [[iron]]''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'' has darksteel coated in oils prior to melting, whereas ''Magic of Faerûn'' has it tempered with oils. While this may be just an unintended change in wording, tempering is a process that follows quenching of the finished product and actually reduces hardness to appropriate degrees in order to increase its toughness.",
        "Usage": "The dwarven forces of [[Iltkazar]] used darksteel arms and armor, among their [[mithral]] and ''[[hizagkuur]]''.<ref>\n\nIt was recommended to clean a darksteel blade with boiled [[linseed oil]] once every seven days or so to avoid rusting.",
        "Value": "For its special properties, a mass of darksteel was worth about 10–12 times the same mass of [[gold]]. A weapon forged from darksteel cost an extra 1,500 gp, while a suit of metal armor cost an additional 2,000 gp.",
        "History": "The exact composition of the alloy was once a closely guarded secret of the [[dwarven]] [[Clan Ironstar]], dating back to the 3{{rd}} century [[DR]], and they were thought to have gone extinct in the following centuries.\n\nDue to the secrecy surrounding the techniques of its creation, the process of making darksteel was thought to be have been lost by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, in the [[Underdark]], the [[deep gnome]]s of [[Blingdenstone]] drove a caravan to [[Mithral Hall]] escorted by a large force of guards and no less than four senior burrow wardens. The caravan was assaulted by [[umber hulk]]s, killing over two dozen svirfneblin and forcing the others to surrender the wagons and retreat. In the aftermath, rumors among the svirfneblin suggested the caravan was transporting darksteel armor, shields, and weapons to present to the Council of Twelve Peers in [[Silverymoon]], but none could say where such a trove could've come from, or who launched the attack, but they feared a faction of isolationists among their own or else surfacers sabotaging their political union. King [[Schnicktick]] declined to comment.\n\nFinally, revelatory [[dwarvish]] texts that described darksteel's formulation were uncovered by [[1372 DR]], leading to new darksteel items being made.\n\n[[File:Honor Among Thieves molten darksteel.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Darksteel melts quickly, but retains its strength and properties.'']]\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Ghelryn Foehammer]] of [[Triboar]] was a noted craftsman of new darksteel weapons, including the greataxe that came to be owned by Holga Kilgore.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} This weapon would survive brief immersion in molten metal during a battle in a blacksmith's forge.",
        "Variants": "The spell ''[[dark alloy]]'' transformed ordinary iron into a form of dark steel that was invisible in sunlight and glowed in darkness. This was used to make secret runes in dwarven shrines and filigrees in weapons that indicated the maker or wielder or the weapon's powers.{{Cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|31}}",
        "Notable Items": "* [[Ironstar mace]]s, [[footman's mace]]s forged entirely from darksteel and able to shatter armor in one blow.{{cite book/Dwarves Deep|44}}\n* ''[[Runehammer]]s'', enchanted darksteel [[warhammer]]s bearing runes of power.{{cite book/Dwarves Deep|45}}\n* [[Olar]] ([[Magekiller]]), a [[short sword]] crafted by [[Clan Brightblade]] and wielded by [[Dorn the Grim]] in hopes of slaying the mage-lord [[Colderan Morn]].\n* The ''[[darksteel greataxe]]'' wielded by [[Holga Kilgore]], which protected her from electricity and shocked its targets.\n* A miniature darksteel battleaxe was one part of the [[Tripartite Key]] in the [[Halls of the Sleeping Legion]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|57,62}}\n\nThe [[blue dragon]] [[Olothontor]], the Minstrel Wyrm, had in his hoard a number of masterwork darksteel weapons, among those of other rare metals.<ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the [[black dragon]] [[Ebondeath]] possessed a darksteel [[runestone]] inscribed on one side with the sign of Clan Ironstar and on the other with an account of the death of King [[Daurvos Frostbeard]] at the [[Stone Bridge]], written in [[Dwarvish]] with [[Dethek]] runes.{{Cite dungeon/73/Eye of Myrkul|47}}"
