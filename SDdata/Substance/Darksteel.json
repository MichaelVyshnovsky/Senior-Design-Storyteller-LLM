        "mainbody": "arksteel was a very hard alloy of star metal created by the dwarves of Clan Ironstar that could be used to forge weapons and armor of special properties and powers. It was also known as dunchalcor, dark steel and ironstar steel.\nDarksteel had a silvery hue when it was cut or polished, while its exposed surfaces bore a deep purple gleaming luster.While Volos Guide to All Things Magical states darksteel is harder and lighter than steel, Magic of Faerûn gives it the same durability and weight. If not strictly a change in rules, it may be that the rediscovered darksteel is not yet as strong or light as the old.\nIt had the unique power to absorb all magical and mundane electrical energy, including lightning, without transferring a charge or effect to its bearer, without even needing to be in contact with the energy. This did not extent to heat, magic missiles, or forms of pure energy.\nDarksteel items were resistant to damage of all kinds, being unaffected by dropping and by natural flames, cold, or electricity resistant to acid, magical fire, crushing, and even disintegration and highly resistant to lightning.\nthumb|right|350px|The darksteel axe shocks on contact.\nA weapon forged from darksteel struck with a slight electric shock.\nMoreover, a darksteel item took on new magical enchantments with relative ease, no matter how many enchantments it already carried. Most notably, melting it did not ruin, and only rarely altered, any enchantments already on the metal.\nIt was formed from star metal, that is, meteoric ironVolos Guide to All Things Magical has darksteel coated in oils prior to melting, whereas Magic of Faerûn has it tempered with oils. While this may be just an unintended change in wording, tempering is a process that follows quenching of the finished product and actually reduces hardness to appropriate degrees in order to increase its toughness.\nThe dwarven forces of Iltkazar used darksteel arms and armor, among their mithral and hizagkuur.\nIt was recommended to clean a darksteel blade with boiled linseed oil once every seven days or so to avoid rusting.\nFor its special properties, a mass of darksteel was worth about 10–12 times the same mass of gold. A weapon forged from darksteel cost an extra 1,500 gp, while a suit of metal armor cost an additional 2,000 gp.\nThe exact composition of the alloy was once a closely guarded secret of the dwarven Clan Ironstar, dating back to the 3 century DR, and they were thought to have gone extinct in the following centuries.\nDue to the secrecy surrounding the techniques of its creation, the process of making darksteel was thought to be have been lost by the 14 century DR\nIn the , in the Underdark, the deep gnomes of Blingdenstone drove a caravan to Mithral Hall escorted by a large force of guards and no less than four senior burrow wardens. The caravan was assaulted by umber hulks, killing over two dozen svirfneblin and forcing the others to surrender the wagons and retreat. In the aftermath, rumors among the svirfneblin suggested the caravan was transporting darksteel armor, shields, and weapons to present to the Council of Twelve Peers in Silverymoon, but none could say where such a trove couldve come from, or who launched the attack, but they feared a faction of isolationists among their own or else surfacers sabotaging their political union. King Schnicktick declined to comment.\nFinally, revelatory dwarvish texts that described darksteels formulation were uncovered by 1372 DR, leading to new darksteel items being made.\nthumb|right|350px|Darksteel melts quickly, but retains its strength and properties.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Ghelryn Foehammer of Triboar was a noted craftsman of new darksteel weapons, including the greataxe that came to be owned by Holga Kilgore. This weapon would survive brief immersion in molten metal during a battle in a blacksmiths forge.\nThe spell dark alloy transformed ordinary iron into a form of dark steel that was invisible in sunlight and glowed in darkness. This was used to make secret runes in dwarven shrines and filigrees in weapons that indicated the maker or wielder or the weapons powers.\n* Ironstar maces, footmans maces forged entirely from darksteel and able to shatter armor in one blow.\n* Runehammers, enchanted darksteel warhammers bearing runes of power.\n* Olar (Magekiller), a short sword crafted by Clan Brightblade and wielded by Dorn the Grim in hopes of slaying the mage-lord Colderan Morn.\n* The darksteel greataxe wielded by Holga Kilgore, which protected her from electricity and shocked its targets.\n* A miniature darksteel battleaxe was one part of the Tripartite Key in the Halls of the Sleeping Legion.\nThe blue dragon Olothontor, the Minstrel Wyrm, had in his hoard a number of masterwork darksteel weapons, among those of other rare metals.\nMeanwhile, the black dragon Ebondeath possessed a darksteel runestone inscribed on one side with the sign of Clan Ironstar and on the other with an account of the death of King Daurvos Frostbeard at the Stone Bridge, written in Dwarvish with Dethek runes."
