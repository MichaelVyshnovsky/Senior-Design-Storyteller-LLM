Infernal iron was a metallic substance that was found in the Nine Hells.
This type of metal was used to forge a variety of hellish items, including
* Battle standard of infernal power, hellish banners that imbued the weapons of its carriers allies with magical energy
* Hellfire weapons, those weapons that claimed the souls of those they slew and directed them to the Styx river
* Infernal war machine, soul-powered vehicles that were often ridden across the wastelands of Avernus
* Shattersticks, a nonâ€“magical rod that created small, concentrated earthquake
* Soul coins, a form of currency commonly used throughout the Nine Hells
* Steel watchers, constructs conceived of and created by Gondians of Baldurs Gate for Enver Gortash.
Among the unique objects made from infernal iron were
* The gargantuan spikes and chains that bound the city of Elturel to Avernus
Some of the locations where infernal iron was known to be mined was Cania, the 8 layer of the Nine Hells and Dis, the 2 layer.
