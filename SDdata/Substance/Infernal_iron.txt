'''Infernal iron''' was a [[:Category:metals|metallic]] substance that was found in the [[Nine Hells]].

{{quote|''I've sensed some during our travels. It has a pull to it - absolutely magnetic, once you know what you're looking for.''|[[Dammon]], a [[tiefling]] smith of [[Elturel]]}}

==Applications==
This type of metal was used to forge a variety of hellish items, including:
* ''[[Battle standard of infernal power]]'', hellish banners that imbued the weapons of its carrier's allies with [[magic]]al energy
* [[Hellfire weapon]]s, those weapons that claimed the souls of those they slew and directed them to the [[Styx]] river
* ''[[Infernal war machine]]'', soul-powered vehicles that were often ridden across the wastelands of [[Avernus]]
* ''[[Shatterstick]]s'', a nonâ€“magical rod that created small, concentrated earthquake
* ''[[Soul coin]]s'', a form of [[currency]] commonly used throughout the Nine Hells
* [[Steel watchers]], constructs conceived of and created by [[Gondian]]s of [[Baldur's Gate]] for [[Enver Gortash]].

Among the unique objects made from infernal iron were:
* The gargantuan spikes and [[chain]]s that bound the city of [[Elturel]] to Avernus

==Production==
Some of the locations where infernal iron was known to be mined was [[Cania]], the 8{{th}} layer of the Nine Hells and [[Dis]], the 2{{nd}} layer.<ref>
