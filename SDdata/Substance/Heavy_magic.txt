==Properties==
Heavy magic seemingly had many alterable properties, though it was particularly viscous. to green to blue.

==History==
===Discovery and Experimentation===
In the [[Shadowed Age]], the [[phaerimm]] wished to wipe out the [[Netherese]]. To start with, they drained magic from the land, as well as nourishment from both raw and produced food. Karsus, however, discovered this drain, and tried to find a way to somehow counter the effects of the phaerimm. The mad [[arcanist]] would experiment with the uses of heavy magic, and even created a [[mouse]]-delivery system where mice transported globs of heavy magic to fill cracks in old walls. 

Heavy magic gained much experimental use throughout the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Karsus (enclave)|Karsus]]. The [[Museum of Heavy Magic]] was constructed, which showed off the various effects of heavy magic experimentation.

===Enhancement===
{{Quote
|This new [[magic]] we've pulled from the sky will add more dweomer than ever before. Mountains of magic!<br/>
For an orgyâ€”a holocaust of magical energy!<br/>
But it will take time. Many revolutions of the [[sun]].<br/>
Not so many. Not so...
|The collective of phaerimm
}}
The phaerimm attempted to speed up their plan to destroy the Netherese by giving them "enough magic to choke". To do this, they spawned a monstrously heavy magical star and pulled it from the sky. The magical star was first discovered by the arcanist [[Candlemas]] and his [[barbarian]] companion [[Sunbright Steelshanks]]. Karsus travelled back in time 358 years to the spot where the two companions had located the star, acquired the star (as well as the companions), and travelled back to the future year of {{Yearlink|-340}}. After experimentation with the star-metal, Karsus created super heavy magic.

===Downfall===
{{Quote
|I, we, Karsus the One and Only, intend to infuse ourselves with super heavy magic!<br/>... With the power of the stars in me, I might become a [[god]]!
|Karsus
}}
In {{Yearlink|-339}}, Karsus infused himself with super heavy magic. He grew taller, and glowed in a white-silver radiance. Babbling incoherent [[arcane]] chants, the super heavy magic raged within him until he came into a state of being between a man and deity. This event lead to the collapse of the Netherese Empire, which was forever known as [[Karsus's Folly]].

Lingering heavy magic from the ''[[Karsestone]]'' was used nearly two millennia later, in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, by [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] to return the [[Princes of Shade]] onto [[Toril]].

==Applications==
{{Quote
|My invention! Heavy magic! It works for everything!
|Karsus
}}
As with magic, heavy magic was able to seemingly do anything. From creating rainbow-fountains, to turning others into liches, there seemed no limit to the applicability of heavy magic.

Applying (super) heavy magic to [[spell]]s appeared to mimic or amplify their effects. For example, applying it to a ''[[flaming sphere]]'' would create a [[fire]] that could not be quenched.

==Production==
{{Quote
|Karsus had made magic a commodity. That the mad mage could manufacture globs of wiggly, clear magic seemed absurd, like a child catching a jar of wind, or a man donning a cloud as a [[robe]]. Yet it worked. Karsus could bottle magic and sell it in the marketplace like [[olive oil]] if he so chose.
|Excerpt from ''[[Dangerous Games]]''
}}
It was not known how Karsus made the original form of heavy magic. However, super heavy magic could be made by storing heavy magic in a star-metal crucible.

==Rumors & Legends==
In {{Yearlink|-345}}, magically mutated creatures infiltrated the enclave of [[Unity]]. It was rumored that these anomalies were created by the use heavy magic.
