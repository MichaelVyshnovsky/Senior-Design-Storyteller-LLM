        "Natural Occurrence": "[[File:Ascore.jpg|thumb|300x300px|''The ruins of [[Ascore]], buried in sand on the edge of Anauroch.'']]\nVast amounts of sand could be found in the natural world, such as the deserts of [[Anauroch]], and [[Raurin]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|28}}\n\nWind could drive piles of sand into piles or hills called dunes, which could cover hundreds of square feet. The strongest of winds could blow dunes large distances in only several days. Dunes always had a steeper slope on the leeward side, where collapses were common. On occasion, a change of wind mid-formation caused a blowout, a hidden hollow cavity that collapsed under weight and sucked in people and animals. A sand crust could form from mud or salt residue, creating a thin, hard surface over a patch of deep, soft sand.\n\nSandstorms were harmful to most creatures, as the driving particles would reduce visibility and chafe skin.\n\n[[Devil dune]]s were massive, malevolent forms of sand that resented trespassers, animated by magical power.\n\n[[Quicksand]] was an area of treacherous ground, usually found in marshes or deserts. In marshes it was a waterlogged, near-liquid soil or sand, while in deserts it was formed from a fine, powdery sand that flowed like water. It was very dangerous to unprepared explorers, who could easily drown in it.",
        "Availability": "* Fine sand could be bought from [[Aurora's Emporium]] for 1 [[sp]] per 10 lb.\n* Fine sand was harvested from near [[Kirinwood]] for the glassmaking industry there.",
