Weapon-black was a useful substance used by some rogues and other nocturnal adventurers.
When smeared on metal this substance eliminated the chance of light reflecting off of a blade and alerting guards. Weapon-black was not harmful to metal and did nothing but dull a blade. Weapon-black was not flammable.
A vial of weapon-black contained enough of the substance for 25 applications.
