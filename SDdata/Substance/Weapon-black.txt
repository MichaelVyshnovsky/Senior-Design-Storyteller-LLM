'''Weapon-black''' was a useful substance used by some [[rogue]]s and other nocturnal adventurers.

==Uses==
When smeared on metal this substance eliminated the chance of light reflecting off of a blade and alerting guards. Weapon-black was not harmful to metal and did nothing but dull a blade. Weapon-black was not flammable.

A [[vial]] of weapon-black contained enough of the substance for 25 applications.
