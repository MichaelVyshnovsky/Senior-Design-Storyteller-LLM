'''Soot''' was a common material substance of the [[Realms]], a kind of impure [[carbon]] similar to [[lampblack]], [[coke]] and [[graphite]].

==Description==
Soot was a deep black, fine powder, similar to ash.

==Availability==
Soot was produced as a residue wherever fuel was burned, such as [[candle]]s, [[torch]]es, [[lamp]]s, fireplaces, [[Forge (item)|forge]]s, and wildfires.

[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold soot for 2 [[cp]] per {{SI|1|lb}}, intended for the arcane uses of [[wizard]]s.

==Usages==
Soot was a common ingredient in [[ink]]s and [[dye]]s for giving a strong black pigment.

Soot could be used to add carbon to an alloying process, such as making [[steel]].

===Spell Components===
Soot was an easily available magical [[material component]], but it could still take time and effort to find a supply with exactly the right properties required.
