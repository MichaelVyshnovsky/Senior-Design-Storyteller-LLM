'''''Deathly ichor''''' was a [[magic]] substance that corroded living things with [[death magic]].

==Description==
This substance was bottled in small breakable [[glass]] [[vial]]s. It was a foul-smelling ichor that was applied to weapons in battle.

==Powers==
When ''deathly ichor'' was applied to a weapon, it temporarily transformed it into an [[enchanted]] ''+3'' weapon that dealt [[necrotic energy]] damage to its targets.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''vials of deathly ichor'' were sometimes used by [[rogue]]s to make their blades more deadly. These concoctions were available for sale at [[Neverwinter]]'s [[Mercenary Arms Depot]] and used by rogues and bandits of the [[Sword Mountains]] and [[the Crags]] on the [[Sword Coast North]]. Servants of the [[vampire lord]] named [[Ozit]] in the ruins of [[Illefarn]] carried ''vials of deathly ichor'' as well as cultists who worshiped a [[beholder]] [[eye of flame]] from their lair in the the Crags.
