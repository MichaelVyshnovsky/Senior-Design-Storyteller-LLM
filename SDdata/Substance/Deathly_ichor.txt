Deathly ichor was a magic substance that corroded living things with death magic.
This substance was bottled in small breakable glass vials. It was a foul-smelling ichor that was applied to weapons in battle.
When deathly ichor was applied to a weapon, it temporarily transformed it into an enchanted +3 weapon that dealt necrotic energy damage to its targets.
In the late 15 century DR, vials of deathly ichor were sometimes used by rogues to make their blades more deadly. These concoctions were available for sale at Neverwinters Mercenary Arms Depot and used by rogues and bandits of the Sword Mountains and the Crags on the Sword Coast North. Servants of the vampire lord named Ozit in the ruins of Illefarn carried vials of deathly ichor as well as cultists who worshiped a beholder eye of flame from their lair in the the Crags.
