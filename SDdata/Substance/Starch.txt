'''Starch''' was a white tasteless powdered substance extracted from [[plant]]s like [[maize]] or [[potato]]s and used in both cooking and clothing presentably.

==Production==
In the [[Underdark]], starch-rich tubers were grown in the [[Great Garden (Fluvenilstra)]] of [[Fluvenilstra]] and were considered highly-prized luxury.

==Usages==
In [[Suzail]] nobles wore white collars that were starched stiff.

Stiff and scratchy lacy white collars were a common sight among the clerics of the [[Moonshadow Hall]] of [[Yhaunn]].

[[Luiren]] school teachers typically were dressed in long black divided skirts and heavily starched white tightly-buttoned blouses with high collars.

Dog-headed [[humanoid]]s from [[Chult]] were known to wear stiff starched white [[kilt]]s.

The uniforms of the [[Hall of Judgment]] in the Karsus Enclave ''circa'' [[âˆ’470 DR]] consisted of starched pleated kilts and long-sleeved black shirts embroidered with an image of golden scales.

In cooking, starch is used as a thickening and stabilizing agent. One of the culinary use examples was the recipe for ''[[the Bitnez Pavlova Extraordinaire!]]'' from ''[[101 Garlic Recipes]]'' cookbook.

==History==
In [[1364 DR]], [[Jill]], [[Arilyn Moonblade]]'s [[dwarvish]] companion suggested the use of starch to deal with an invisible opponent.

By the 1370s [[DR]], starched white shirts were considered a height of fashion in Waterdeep.
