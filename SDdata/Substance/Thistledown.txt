'''Thistledown''' was a type of expensive [[elf|elven]] textile, greatly valued in the [[Realms]] as the material used to create ''[[cloaks of elvenkind]]''.

==Description==
Thistledown was a fine quality grayish fabric. It was impressively light and seemingly immune to being snagged by the forest branches and shrubbery. Its light weight and color was the reason the material was named after plant down that carried seeds with the wind. The fabric was also predisposed for easy [[Item enchantment|enchantment]].

==Usage==
Apart from being used to weave ''cloaks of elvenkind'', thistledown fabric was also used to make lightweight [[padded armor]], such as ''[[thistledown suit]]s'', favored by [[arcane magic]]users.

==Notable Owners==
* [[Lehland]], an elven merchant who lived in the [[Hand of the Seldarine]]. He still sold [[moth]]-taten thistledown as a [[ghost]], after the citadel's fall.
