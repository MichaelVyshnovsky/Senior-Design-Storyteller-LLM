        "mainbody": "'''''Ironfell''''', also called \"'''the iron'''\" by the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]], was a [[magic]]al, [[metal]]-like substance mined from the constantly regenerating body of the fallen [[primordial]] [[Telos]].",
        "Properties": "Worked ''ironfell'' was lusterless in color. It had a crystalline structure but otherwise had a similar appearance and hardness as [[steel]], and accepted enchantment readily. \n\nA warlock who had made a [[Warlock#Star_Pact.2C_the_Great_Old_One|star pact]] with Telos was able to use weapons and armor made from ''ironfell'' to channel the primordial's power, which manifested as radiant light emanating from the weapons and protection from the same by the armor. Items made from the substance could also be used in [[ritual]] magic, such as the [[Pact of the Iron Ring]].",
        "Applications": "''Ironfell'' was used to make weapons, equipment, and magic items for the Warlock Knights. All Warlock Knights wore a simple ''[[ironfell ring]]'' to signify their status, and most Knights above a certain rank owned distinctive ceremonial armor also made of the substance.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Warlock Knights were integrating ''ironfell'' into their realm's [[currency]] by creating alloys of it with traditional precious metals: the [[copper]] and ''ironfell'' alloyed coins were called [[nub (coin)|nubs]], [[silver]] and ''ironfell'' alloyed coins were called [[dirk (coin)|dirks]], [[gold]] and ''ironfell'' alloyed coins were called [[anvil (coin)|anvils]], and the [[platinum]] and ''ironfell'' alloy was minted into thin [[trade bar]]s worth 50 anvils each.\n\n''Ironfell'' was also used to make [[golem]]-like constructs called [[shardsoul]]s.",
        "History": "[[Telos]] fell to [[Faerûn]] during the [[Spellplague]] and landed in the wastes of Vaasa. After his body was discovered, ''ironfell'' began to be harvested from it, and it was soon determined that this material could be used to siphon the power of the comatose primordial for use in combat. This discovery led to the formation of the Warlock Knights, who would go on to use Telos' power to conquer Vaasa in the mid-to-late 15{{th}} Century DR.\n\nThe Knights built [[Telos (city)|their capital city]] on top of Telos which was named in his honor.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}"
