Adamant was a pure, jet-black metal ore that was found on Toril. It was among the hardest, lightest, and most brittle ores on the planet, being used in the creation of the alloy adamantine. Adamant was extremely rare throughout the realms, materializing in spherical clusters within solidified volcanic flows.
Despite its extreme hardness, adamant was so brittle that a weapon or shield forged from the metal could be easily shattered by another metal weapon or even a hardwood staff or club. It offered great protection against both magical and natural flames, and was inherently immune to all elemental effects.
Adamant was glossy black in appearance and reflected images with a distinct rainbow outline.
As of the mid–14 century DR, the pure form of adamant was not used in the forging of weapons and armor in Faerûn, owing to its unique properties. However, adamant styluses were used to etch inscriptions and ornamental designs into other metal items.
It was often used in metallurgic experiments by dwarves as they constantly sought to create an alloy that was superior to the well-known adamantine. Some dwarves worked with wizards to create enchanted, adamant plate mail such that when shattered, the fragments of the black metal would remain magically bound to provide some imperfect form of protection for the wearer.
A quantity of adamant was worth five times the same amount of gold. An adamant stylus typically sold for 35–50 gp, but they were not commonly found across the Realms, save for in the Great Rift and perhaps the city of Waterdeep.
