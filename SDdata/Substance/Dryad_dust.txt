'''Dryad dust''' was a grey toxic powder in the post-[[Spellplague]] era that induced a form of insanity when ingested.<ref group="note" name="classification">It is never stated within the game ''Daggerdale'' what, if any, relation the powder had to actual [[dryad]]s.

==Effects==
Ingestion of dryad dust induced a violent mad frenzy in creatures, one in which they were unable to discern friends from foes and would attack anyone that came near them.How long this insanity lasted for, whether it was a temporary or permanent condition, was never stated.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, [[Garbo Silvertongue]], a [[dwarf]] living within the settlement of [[Granstone]] in the [[mines of Tethyamar]] grew impatient and fed up with the progress being made towards the dwarves reclaiming their ancestral home of Tethyamar. Garbo decided to betray his people to [[Rezlus]], a [[Zhent]] [[wizard]] who was amassing an army to conquer [[Daggerdale]] and the greater [[Dalelands]] region and who was stationed in a tower above the mines, atop the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]. In return for this betrayal, Rezlus promised Garbo dominion over the mines of Tethyamar.

Garbo Silvertongue went on to poison some of Granstone's water supply with dryad dust, driving dwarves in the eastern work camp into a frenzy that resulted in lots of damage to the surrounding area. These were initially mistaken by inhabitants as being some sort of [[curse]] afflicting their people. Garbo then planted the dryad dust within a satchel belonging to one of the settlement's leaders, Master [[Paxton]], in order to frame him.

Around this time, a party of four Daggerdalesmen [[adventurer]]s were traveling through the mines of Tethyamar to defeat Rezlus. Along the way, they traveled through Granstone and slew many of the dwarves that had been driven mad by dryad dust. They then consulted with Granstone's other leader, Master [[Ayer]], who revealed his discovery of dryad dust being involved. Ayer then ordered the adventurers to destroy Granstone's reserves of barreled water before all the dwarves succumbed to madness and asked them to bring him any package that they might suspect to be holding the powder. Fighting through more crazed dwarves and Zhent-allied forces along the way, they eventually recovered a satchel and presented it to Master Ayer, discovering that it belonged to Master Paxton. Ayer was skeptical that Paxton would be responsible, but had no time to discuss the matter with him as a horde of Zhent-allied [[goblin]]s launched an assault upon Granstone and captured Ayer.

While caged, Ayer was confronted by Garbo, who admitted his responsibility for the dryad dust and further stated that he was planning kill the other dwarves by [[poison]]ing the rest of Granstone's water reserves with the powder. However, before Garbo could carry out this plan Ayer was rescued by the four Daggerdalesmen and informed them of everything.
