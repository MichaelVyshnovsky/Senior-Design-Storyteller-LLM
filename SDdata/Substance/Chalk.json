        "History": "[[File:Skywrite.png|thumb|250px|''A mage uses chalk to cast the ''skywrite'' spell.'']]\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the southern ward of [[Kappiyan Flurmastyr]]'s home featured a round line of chalk, which acted as an arcane ward. Outside the ward were [[undead]] creatures, waiting to prey on those inside. [[Piergerion's Palace]] had a chalk circle on its landing, right in front of the doors, indicating the presence of [[magic]]al sigils, though it was unknown why.",
        "Applications": "Chalk was often powdered for a variety of purposes. It could be laid out by adventurers to form a thin white layer; creatures walking through the powdered chalk would leave tracks. Powdered chalk could also be thrown at invisible creatures or objects, exposing them.\n\nSticks of chalk were [[material component]]s for spells such as ''[[stone tell]]''. The [[mage]] had to draw a face with complete features, in order for the spell to function correctly. It was also required to cast ''[[friends]]'', ''[[protection from acid]]'', ''[[protection from the elements]]'', ''[[skywrite]]'', ''[[glyph of revealing]]'', and ''[[restore rune]]''.\n\n[[Builder genie]]s were almost always found carrying sticks of chalk. Chalk sticks were also found in [[disguise kit]]s, where it was used to lighten the skin. Slate and chalk were sold by [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]], and were used to preserve records. They were especially popular with [[wizard]]s and those that worked in laboratories. Colored sticks of chalk could also be purchased here, though they were often triple the price of standard sticks.\n\nResidents of [[Vilhon Reach]] were often marked with chalk on their heads. One dot of chalk meant that they could read, two meant they could write, and three mean that they were versed in [[the Art]].",
        "Production": "Several cliffs contained chalk, such as those of [[Shining White]].",
        "Notable Owners": "* King [[Pinch]] always kept chalk with him, in order to mark his way through new places.",
        "Notable Producers": "* The [[gnome]] village of [[Urbryur]] was a well-known producer of chalk.{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}"
