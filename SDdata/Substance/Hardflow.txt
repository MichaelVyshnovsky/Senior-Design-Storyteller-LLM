Hardflow, or concrete, was a composite construction material used in the Realms alongside mortar, cement, and asphalt.
While the base stone for hardflow was supplied by dwarves from the crushed-up rubble of their mining excavation projects, it was usually processed by human wizards who used magical artifice to make the finished product. Concrete was most often handled and installed by dwarven architects, and was also commonly used by urban halfling, gnome, and human builders as well. It was sometimes used for the construction of large, solid forms such as floors and drains, but was most often used for sealing gaps.
Concrete and similar products were very common in Lantan, which had also developed reinforced concrete. The recipes and methods involved in these materials were often closely-held family secrets for the Lantanna, as it was for other bespoke materials such as plastic.
* The city walls of Marsember had large outward-facing storm drains made of concrete.
* The Palace of Governance in Zazesspur had concrete front steps.
* The colonial outpost fortresses of the City of Brass were made from a range of durable materials, including a kind of volcanic concrete.
* Transmute stone to sand, clearstone, and similar spells had no effect upon concrete, as it was sufficiently intermixed with other materials to no longer resemble natural stone.
