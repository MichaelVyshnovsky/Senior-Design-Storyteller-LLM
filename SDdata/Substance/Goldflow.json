        "mainbody": "oldflow was the name given to a certain type of waste product.It is very likely that goldflow refers to urine, but this is never stated.\nThis waste product was useful in several different methods of manufacturing. In Baldurs Gate, it was often left out on the streets during the night or morning for collection as waste. Residents would pay fees to those who collected their goldflow and nightsoil.\nIn the 15 century DR, everyone who left Baldurs Gate with a handcart or litter of goldflow had to pay a silver piece. As opposed to nightsoil carriers, who only had to pay an extra copper piece charge, goldflow carriers had to pay triple.\nIn 1482 DR, Baldurs Gate had approximately 150 goldflow and nightsoil carriers. During this year, the Guild arranged for goldflow and nightsoil carriers to slow down their waste-hauling operations. This made the Upper and Lower City smell incredibly bad, which angered the residents."
