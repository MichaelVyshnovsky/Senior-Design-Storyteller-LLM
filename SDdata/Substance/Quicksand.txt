Quicksand was a naturally-occurring terrain feature and hazard made up of sand or dirt that took a near-liquid consistency.
Found in swamps, bogs, and low-lying wet areas, quicksand was a volume of waterlogged, near-liquid sand or dirt. Appearing innocuously as a patch of ground up to  across with little to no undergrowth, quicksand was hard to notice for inexperienced or inattentive creatures. A creature such as a human could unwittingly blunder into the quicksand, at which point they would begin sinking through the ground.
Sand-based quicksand was a treacherously thin mixture of water and sand, causing the victim to sink rapidly if they could not keep calm and tread water. Although it was possible to escape without drowning, the effort of swimming and climbing out of sandy water was exhausting, so being rescued by others using a pole or branch (or a strong, experienced swimmer) was highly recommended.
Dry quicksand in the desert.
Earthy, dirt-based quicksand was effectively a pit of thick mud, and could be water-treaded and swam out of with relative ease as long as the victim wasnt exhausted, overly encumbered, or injured. Mudslides formed similar hazards, potentially washing victims along into an area filled with mud.
In deserts, quicksand formed from large amounts of fine, powdery sand that gathered in depressions. Like watery quicksand, it could swallow people and animals easily if they were encumbered or responded with panicked movements that dug them in deeper.
