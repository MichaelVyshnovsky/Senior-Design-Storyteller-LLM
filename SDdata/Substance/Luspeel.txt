Luspeel was the Realms name for a hardstone also known as magnetite or lodestone.
Luspeel appeared as a hard, black metallic stone.
Luspeel was an ore of iron, but was notable for being naturally magnetic. Though it held no magic, luspeel possessed a natural property to attract lightning, especially if mined from a particularly potent vein.
Lodestones were used or sold by chandlers, navigators, astronomers, and magical supply shops.
A typical price for large quantities of this hardstone was three gold pieces per .
Auroras Emporium sold reagent-quality lodestones through its catalogue for 5 sp per . Refined magnets could also be obtained in 1 inch (5 sp), 2 inch (1gp) and 3 inch (3 gp) cubes.
* An enormous deposit of lodestone beneath the Crowded Sea near the Steaming Isles was strong enough to affect ships passing over the surface, potentially killing the crew as metal objects shifted and crushed them, or tearing the ship apart as they shattered the hull. This phenomenon was responsible for the typical nail-free shipbuilding of Zakhara.

* Gnomes devised simple locks that used an iron pin hidden behind a wooden door panel, only accessible if a lodestone was used to pull the pin into place.
* Lodestones could be used with iron filings to investigate magical effects, looking for disturbances in the iron filings.
* The affinity for lightning made luspeel useful in the manufacture of magical items and affixing enchantments. It was especially necessary for tempering swords that were intended to be bound with multiple enchantments.
* The lightning-attracting property of this mundane stone made it invaluable in countering certain types of spells. One such spell was Obolds brightness. When a lodestone was tossed in the spells area of effect, the lightning sparks became focused on the stone, quickly draining brightness of its energy. This tool was used by Halruaan Jordaini.
