'''Tar pits''' were a kind of naturally-occurring sinking hazard found throughout the [[Realms]], made up of [[petroleum]] and [[bitumen]], a kind of [[oil]] and [[tar]] separate from common plant and animal based varieties.

==Properties==
Tar pits were pools of glistening black liquid, and sticky to the touch.{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|61}}

==Occurrences==
Tar pits usually formed when petroleum welled up from deep underground and reached the surface, forming pools of noxious, stinking black liquid If the oil emerged in swampy terrain, it poisoned the area and became a "dead marsh".

They were especially prevalent in [[Var]], [[Veldorn]], [[Ulgarth]], and the nearby [[Utter East]], in [[Chult]], the [[Alimir Mountains]], and on islets within the [[Lake of Steam]]. Tar pits also formed within the [[Underdark]], as the empty space of it interrupted the upward flow of the oil towards the surface. Tunnels and caverns could be home to entire lakes of tar, depending on the geology, and were especially prevalent under the [[Eastern Shaar]], while rivers flowed near underground volcanism.

Tar pits began appearing in [[Myrloch Vale]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]] amid the supernatural destruction caused by [[Bhaal]] in [[1346 DR]].

Bubbling tar pits were a common hazard in [[Avernus]] of the [[Nine Hells]].

The former [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Sysquemalyn]] knew a Hellish spell that summoned up tar from the ground, forming a kind of tar pit.
