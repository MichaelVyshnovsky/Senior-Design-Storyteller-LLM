        "Usage": "*In the [[Blade Kingdoms]], talcum powder was used as a tool against thieves and spellcasters. The powder was used to dust floors in high-security locations, such as the [[Palace of Manniccis]] in the city-state of [[Sumbria]]. Talcum made it extremely challenging for sneak thieves and creatures under the effects of the ''[[invisibility]]'' spells to move undetected. The powder was often used alongside [[caltrop]]s and [[mine]]s.\n\n*Apart from security purposes, talcum powder was one of the [[material component]]s for the ''[[see invisibility]]'' spell.<ref>{{Cite book| author =Â Richard W. and Anne Brown| title = Falcon's Revenge| short_story = | date = 1990| editor = Timothy B.
