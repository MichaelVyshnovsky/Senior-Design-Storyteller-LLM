Arambarium was an extremely rare metal that resembled polished silver. It was tuned to primordial and elemental energy and could amplify magical effects. It also had mundane uses such as in armor.
The only known source of Arambarium around 1479 DR was Ithimir Isle off the coast of Akanûl. The Akanûlans mined the deposit and kept its location a closely guarded secret. In reality, the Arambarium mother lode was the preserved fist of the dead primordial Arambar.
