'''Goldflow''' was the name given to a certain type of waste product.<ref group="note">It is very likely that goldflow refers to urine, but this is never stated.

==Uses==
This waste product was useful in several different methods of manufacturing. In [[Baldur's Gate]], it was often left out on the streets during the night or morning for collection as waste. Residents would pay fees to those who collected their goldflow and [[nightsoil]].

==History==
In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], everyone who left Baldur's Gate with a handcart or litter of goldflow had to pay a [[silver piece]]. As opposed to nightsoil carriers, who only had to pay an extra [[copper piece]] charge, goldflow carriers had to pay triple.

In [[1482 DR]], Baldur's Gate had approximately 150 goldflow and nightsoil carriers. During this year, the [[Guild]] arranged for goldflow and nightsoil carriers to slow down their waste-hauling operations. This made the [[Upper City|Upper]] and [[Lower City]] smell incredibly bad, which angered the residents.
