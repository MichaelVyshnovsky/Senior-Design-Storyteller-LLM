Snowhare yarn was also weaved using cashmere wool, in part.\nAn enchanted variety called cashmere spellthread was made by treating cashmere thread with a magical substance called concentrated residuum. This high-quality cashmere helped in channeling enchantments.\n* Atreus Eleint, a 14 century DR warrior from the Utter East, wore a cape of brocaded cashmere."
