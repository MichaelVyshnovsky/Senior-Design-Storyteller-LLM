'''Copper''' was a common, precious pure metal used in [[Faerûn]] as the least-valued form of currency in most economies.

==Description==
In its natural form, copper had a distinct pink sheen. It was quite soft and famously easy to work in a forge. It had the same weight as [[steel]].

==Worth==
Most coins in Faerûn worked off of the [[silver]] and [[gold]] standard, with copper pieces (cp) being worth  1/100th of a gold piece (gp) and silver pieces (sp) being worth 1/10 of a GP. [[Electrum]] coins were worth 50 cp (1/2 gp), and [[platinum]] coins were worth between 500cp (5gp) and 1,000cp (10gp).

==Applications==

In addition to its use in the minting of coins, as well as the creation of ornamental items, copper was a well-known metallurgic amalgamator and neutralizer. Copper containers were never used to store [[holy water]] as it would gradually nullify any [[divine]] qualities of the solution within a matter of months.

Priests who planned on making an offering with a substance that was forbidden by their faith, could replace the offending item with an amount of copper equal to half its weight.
