'''Shimmerweave''' was a type of expensive textile in the [[Realms]].

==Description==
Clothes made of shimmerweave were slippery smooth like [[silk]]{{Cite dragon/390/Lord of the Darkways|72}} The reflection of a [[candle]]'s flame lent it a "shimmer," thus giving this fabric its name. Its texture was akin to [[satin]]. The fabric did not develop wrinkles as easily as [[cotton]], even though both weighed roughly the same. While waterproof, shimmerweave suffered from increased flammability.

The cloth woven of shimmerweave came in various colors, including the deepest black, shimmering [[silver]],

==Creation==
Shimmerweave was made of [[flax]] textile that was oiled early in its creation process, followed by two dyeing processes towards the end.

==Usage==
