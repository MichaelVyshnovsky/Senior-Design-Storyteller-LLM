It was intended for use in laboratories and by wizards.\nBitumen could be found in natural oil pools and tar pits, mined from the ground, or distilled from petroleum and coal. These rock oil and tar deposits were most common in the Shining Lands of Veldorn, Var, and Ulgarth, in Chult, and around the Lake of Steam. Huge pools of oil could also be found in the Underdark, especially under the Eastern Shaar.\n* Bitumen was used as a sealant by carpenters, shipwrights, and coopers, and was used in alchemical recipes.\n* Spider climb and improved spider climb used a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both eaten by the caster."
