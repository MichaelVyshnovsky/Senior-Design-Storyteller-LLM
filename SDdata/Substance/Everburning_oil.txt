'''Everburning oil''', also called '''Greek fire''' by knowledgable wizards, was a mixture of oil and other substances designed for use in combat. It was easy to ignite but difficult to extinguish, and had a tendency to stick to anything it hit.

==Use==
Everburning oil was sometimes employed in the defense of cities or as armament of ships in so-called Greek fire projectors or flame cannons.

==Distribution==
In [[Zakhara]] it went by the name '''oil of stars''' The city of [[Qudra]] produced this dangerous substance, while the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] banned it in [[1370 DR]] due to the risk it posed.
