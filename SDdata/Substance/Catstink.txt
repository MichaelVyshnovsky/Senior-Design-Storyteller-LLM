Catstink was a type of alchemical compound used by thieves to throw off the scent of dogs or any creature that may be tracking them.
Catstink was a liquid compound with a thick consistency and a brown-yellow hue. It had a particularly strong odor, specially designed to agitate the senses of dogs, that could be picked up by dogs as far away as  or even  if they were downwind of it. Any dog who caught a whiff of this compound, no matter how highly trained they were, would forgo all other commands as they frantically tried to search for the "cat" they were smelling.
Once thrown down, the odor of catstink would persist for a duration of 10 minutes.
This compound was used among thieves to throw off the scent of creatures that were tracking them, primarily dogs, or to distract guard dogs.
Creating this compound required alchemicals to blend liquids obtained from various parts of cats with a select few secret ingredients.
