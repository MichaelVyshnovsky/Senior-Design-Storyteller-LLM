'''Lime''' or '''quicklime''' was a substance used for a variety of purposes.

==Description==
Lime had a distinct mineral smell and could be found in solid chunks, ground into a white powder, or mixed with water to make a paste called '''slaked lime'''. In areas such as drains where water concentrated, the dissolved lime could leave a visible deposit.

==Availability==
* [[Aurora's Emporium]] sold pieces of lime for 1 [[sp]] per 12 oz, or powder for 2 [[sp]] per 12 oz.
* Lime was widely available throughout the Realms and was regularly traded and transported in bulk, in powdered, slaked, or chunk form.

==Usage==
* Lime was a popular material in construction projects. It was commonly used as a binder mixed with [[sand]] and water to produce [[mortar]], It was mixed with mud to make a kind of inexpensive cement for waterproofing drainpipes in warmer climates that didn't freeze,{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Drainpipes}}{{Cite web/Realmslore/Rural Realms Architecture (Part Three)}} and could be mixed into thatching for roofs.
* Slaked lime was made into whitewash, a bright white and hardy [[paint]] commonly used around the Realms to paint buildings white. It was used in traditional [[Maztican]], [[Shou]], and [[Calishite]] construction for thousands of years.
* Skins and hides were treated with lime along with [[vinegar]], [[beeswax]], and various other substances in the production of [[leather]],{{Cite dragon/98/Knowing what's in store|32}} while [[vellum]] was made by treating [[calfskin]].
* Lime could be used for pickling food, and was used in the production of many alchemical potions.
* When [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[battlerager]]s shaved their heads and beards, occasionally they left some hair that they stiffened with lime or [[grease]]. 
* [[Stinkpot]]s were often made to shower foes with quicklime.
* [[Brown mold oil]] was a dangerous flask of ground-up [[brown mold]], temporarily neutralized by a mix of lime and algae.{{Cite dragon/322/The Ecology of the Dark Ones|322}}
* Powdered lime was used to clean the privies of establishments such as the [[Masked Merfolk]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Privy Cleaning}} Powdered lime and dirt was also laid over dung pits to limit the stench.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-22/Dealing with poop}}
* Space-efficient burials were sometimes performed with multiple bodies stacked together with lime and dirt between them. Entire pits of lime were sometimes used for the disposal of bodies, such as for dealing with the mass-burial of plague victims.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Stench Carts}} the [[Dark Corner]],{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 58: Kh√¥ltar, Part 9, Tarrying Nigh Handrornlar}} [[Three Old Kegs]], the village of [[Urbryur]],{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}} and [[drow]].
