        "mainbody": "ellfire was a type of energy, which was also described as a magical substance.\nMephistopheles was the first one to invent the method to create it.\nThe use of hellfire became commonplace among the archdevils. However, Mephistopheles remained its best user\nHellfire was a kind of fire. It glowed white and was very hot. The temperature hellfire reached exceeded that of any other form of fire. It was so high that protection against heat, including complete immunity, was worthless against it. Hellfires destructive capabilities extended to objects too. No matter how the object in question was protected, no matter how well it could withstand heat, hellfire simply destroyed it.\nOne branch of warlocks that could use hellfire regardless of their ethical and moral outlook were the hellfire warlocks. They could enhance their magical abilities with hellfire. However, channeling hellfire was dangerous to the physical health of the user and could kill him or her with overuse.\nHellfire could be created by using the plane of Baator as a direct source of energy."
