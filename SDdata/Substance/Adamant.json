        "mainbody": "{{Wikipedia article|Adamant}}\n'''Adamant''' was a pure, jet-black metal ore that was found on [[Toril]]. It was among the hardest, lightest, and most brittle ores on the planet, being used in the creation of the alloy [[adamantine]]. Adamant was extremely rare throughout the realms, materializing in spherical clusters within solidified volcanic flows.",
        "Description": "Despite its extreme hardness, adamant was so brittle that a weapon or shield forged from the metal could be easily shattered by another metal weapon or even a [[:Category:Hardwood items|hardwood]] staff or club. It offered great protection against both [[magic]]al and natural flames, and was inherently immune to all elemental effects.\n\nAdamant was glossy black in appearance and reflected images with a distinct rainbow outline.",
        "Uses": "As of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the pure form of adamant was not used in the forging of [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] in [[Faerûn]], owing to its unique properties. However, adamant styluses were used to etch inscriptions and ornamental designs into other metal items.\n\nIt was often used in metallurgic experiments by [[dwarves]] as they constantly sought to create an alloy that was superior to the well-known adamantine. Some dwarves worked with [[wizards]] to create [[Item enchantment|enchanted]], adamant [[plate mail]] such that when shattered, the fragments of the black metal would remain magically bound to provide some imperfect form of protection for the wearer.",
        "Cost": "A quantity of adamant was worth five times the same amount of [[gold]]. An adamant stylus typically sold for 35–50 [[gp]], but they were not commonly found across the Realms, save for in the [[Great Rift]] and perhaps the city of [[Waterdeep]]."
