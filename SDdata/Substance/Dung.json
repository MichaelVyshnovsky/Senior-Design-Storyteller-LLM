        "mainbody": "'''Dung''' was a waste product commonly used as fuel for cooking and heating in the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]]. The word in [[Common]] was '''''naeth'''''.\n\nHeaps of dung were sometimes found within dungeons, and bat dung, known as '''guano''', was actively mined in many lands in [[Faerûn]].",
        "Properties": "[[Alchemist]]s claimed that the dung of certain [[dragon]]s had many special properties, such as quick ignition even in cold or wet conditions and the production of an intense blue flame. A [[red dragon]]'s dung contained significant quantities of [[potassium nitrate]] and [[sulfur]], making it potentially explosive, as well as metal and stone [[Wikipedia:gastrolith|stomach stones]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/134/The Ecology of the Red Dragon|36}}",
        "Applications": "In desert regions, dried [[camel]] dung (called '''''jalla''''' in [[Midani language|Midani]]) was often used as fuel; in the cold reaches of the far north, the dung of local pack animals was used instead, Some farmers used the dung of pack animals as fertilizer, including [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[mule]]s.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Horl, Breeder of Mules}}\n\nDung was a common [[material component]] of several [[spell]]s. A pinch of [[bull]]'s dung was used as one of the possible components required for the [[Arcane magic|arcane]] version of the ''[[bull's strength]]'' spell and its derivations. Similarly, [[fox]] dung was potentially used when casting the spell ''[[fox's cunning]]'', and [[eagle]]'s droppings were used for ''[[eagle's splendor]]''. (In all cases, hair or feathers from the respective animals could be used as an alternative material component.)\n\nDragon's dung was smeared on wounds as a medicine to quicken growth and healing.",
        "Reputation": "Words for dung in various languages were used as curses. ''Naeth'' was considered mild, but when pronounced '''''naed''''', the word was considered stronger language.",
        "Removal": "[[Sewer]]s were used to carry away dung from many cities, but in places without access to streams or where tidal changes were problematic, [[nightsoil wagon|dung wagons]] were used instead. In the cities of [[Suzail]] and [[Athkatla]], which did not have well-working sewer systems, the dung from people's chamber pots carried off by such wagons was called \"''''night soil''''\". Dung wagons were often used by smugglers to transport items or even people out of such cities. The job of carting away dung was often given to the disabled, poor, orphans, or others claiming sanctuary at various temples or [[monasteries]].\n\nA class of creatures known as [[gulguthra]]s were known to consume dung as part of their diet.{{Cite dragon/96/The Ecology of the Gulguthra|20-22}}\n\nIn [[Sumbria]], one of the city-states of the [[Blade Kingdoms]], daily offerings of all the town's \"seats of ease\" and outhouses were collected by honey carts every evening. The manure was carted to the shores of [[Akanamere]] and deposited onto a honey barge. From there, the odoriferous vessel traveled to distant farms on Akanamere shores, blessing them with quality fertilizer.",
        "Variations": "The dung produced by [[cow]]s was referred to as cow chips by inhabitants of [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Delimbiyr Vale]]. The cow dung scent was similar to the smell of [[Modovian dung beetle]]s.\n\n[[Mephit]] guano was a substance with some magical properties. It was used to [[enchant]] items and, if thrown, exploded in a deadly ''[[stinking cloud]]''. Carrying such items around was frowned upon and their stench was surely to scare people away.",
        "Trivia": "* One of the entrances to the city of [[Zazesspur]] was called the [[Dung Gate]].\n* Personal [[hygiene]] in regards of cleaning nightsoil off varied. Some used hand-scoop method, travelers could use sand along a river bank, others \"skidded their bum along in the snow,\" the wealthy were known to use scented [[thareea]] wipe cloths, as well as tough leaves of the [[thallow]] and [[yahllavur-fern]] plants.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240405041010/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jan – Mar 2006| accessdate = 5-4-2024| date = 23-1-2006}}"
