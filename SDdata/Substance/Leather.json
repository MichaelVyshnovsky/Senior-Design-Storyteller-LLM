        "mainbody": "'''Leather''' was the processed hide or skin of an animal, widely used in [[Faerûn]] and beyond for various crafts. It was produced by tanners through the process of [[tanning]].",
        "Description": "Leather could be made from the skin of practically any animal, though each had their advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common hides used came from [[cow]]s, [[ox]]en, [[rothé]], [[horse]]s, and [[donkey]]s, which had large and durable skins. The hides of [[deer]], [[wolves]], [[bear]]s, [[lion]]s, [[manticore]]s, and other beasts were also desirable, though harder to obtain. Scaly hides such as from [[bulette]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[dragon]]s could also be used like leather, but the product was quite different.",
        "Production": "In some areas, the professions of skinners, tanners, and leatherworkers were controlled or regulated by trade [[guild]]s, like the [[League of Skinners and Tanners]] in [[Waterdeep]], which supplied the bulk of leather used by artisans of other guilds such as the [[Saddlers' and Harness-makers' Guild]], [[Order of Cobblers and Corvisers]], and [[Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers]].\n\nTools used in leatherworking included the [[round knife]], the [[swivel knife]], and the [[awl]], which were each highly specialized tools adapted for carefully cutting leather.",
        "Usage": {
            "Spell Components": "* ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' and its variants used a leather glove as a component.\n* ''[[Displacement]]'' used a strip of [[displacer beast]] leather.\n* ''[[Freedom of movement]]'' used a leather thong.\n* ''[[Levitate]]'' could use a leather loop.\n* ''[[Mage armor]]'' used a piece of cured leather.\n* ''[[Suspension]]'' used a small leather loop hanging from a [[gold]] [[wire]]."
        },
        "Notable Leatherworkers": "* [[Anaster's Leatherworks]], a leather shop famed for its leather balls.\n* [[Eagleshield Fine Horse Leathers]], a luxury leathergoods shop in Waterdeep.\n* The [[Leatherworkers' Conglomerate]] in [[Daggerford]] was a guildhall and shop for leatherworkers.\n* [[Lhuin's Fine Leathers]], a tannery and leatherwork shop in [[Ashabenford]].\n* [[Old Dulwar's Leatherworks]], a tannery and leatherwork shop outside of [[Dagger Falls]].\n* [[Sorkryn's Soft Hides of Scornubel]], a trader in hides and animals in [[Scornubel]].\n* [[Telethar Leatherworks]] was a prominent Waterdhavian leathergoods shop.\n* [[Torpus's Tannery]], in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n* [[Whelanxdryn's of Elturel]], a tannery, leatherworking, and metalworking shop that specialized in scabbards."
