'''Gold''' was a pure precious metal that was used in [[Faerûn]] as the baseline of most currency. Despite its high value it was fairly commonly found throughout [[Toril]].

==Description==
Gold was a soft, malleable and exceptionally conductive metal.

==Worth==
[[File:Treasure AFRT.jpg|thumb|A treasure chest filled with gold coins.]]
Most coins in Faerûn worked off of the [[silver]] and gold standard, with [[copper]] pieces (cp) being worth  1/100th of a gold piece ([[gp]]) and silver pieces (sp) being worth 1/10 of a gp. and [[platinum]] coins were worth 10 gp.Unfortunately, for both of these statements to be true, a typical gold coin had very little gold in it and was either alloyed with a ''much'' lighter metal, like aluminum, or was made of a gold-clad wooden disk. The density of gold is 19.32 g/cm³ and a pure gold coin of those dimensions would weigh about {{SI|1.7|oz|long=yes}} or over five times the weight of a "standard" coin. This suggests that the dimensions of a standard coin should be smaller and thinner. Any less than that and they were considered by most to be "shaved" and worth less than newly minted coins.

The metal was valuable to many artisans for its malleability and aesthetic qualities.

==Uses==
Gold was prized by many [[wizards]] for its [[magic]]al properties. If refined and treated with the right magical processes, gold could become as hard as [[steel]] and used to forge effective [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, which could hold a number of [[Item enchantment|enchantments]], even those that conflicted one another. While it offered significant protection against fire and acid, golden armor was twice as heavy as steel and more encumbering.

Gold was specifically used in the crafting of ''[[shoonring]]s'' that had multiple magical properties.

Gold was favored by the gods [[Abbathor]], [[Geb]], [[Hanali Celanil]], [[Thard Harr]], [[Ubtao]], and [[Vergadain]] and seen as a sign of their blessings.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

[[Waukeen]], the goddess of wealth and trade, was known as Our Lady of Gold, and was said to wield a cloud of gold coins as a weapon.
