The metal melted at 420 degrees Celsius (788 degrees Fahrenheit).\nIt had such metaphysical properties that a properly calibrated tuning fork could be used to send a planar traveler to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and to associated planes.\nAt least two known alloys of copper and zinc were considered brass red brass with 20% zinc, and yellow brass with 30% zinc.

Another zinc alloy was halduthra.\nThe most important ore of zinc was sphalerite, a yellow-brown, hard yet brittle ore weighing about 250 pounds per cubic foot (4 grams per cubic centimeter).\nThe mines at the Gnoll Peaks north of Hillmarch provided a modest amount of zinc.\nIt was mined in Dis, within the Nine Hells."
