        "mainbody": "'''Zardazil''' was a rare soft-metal used to create alloyed [[weapon]]s that were undetectable and could be easily \"hidden inside\" a person. Because of the unique properties of zardazil-alloy weapons, they could be ''phased'' within a person and carried under complete concealment.",
        "Description": "In its raw state, zardazil was an amber to red color, similar to raw [[iron]] in some respects. It was also rather soft for a metal but extremely durable.",
        "Locations": "This metal was scarce and in the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], it was found only in mountains and mines around the [[Lake of Steam]] and in sandy fissures in the heart of the [[Raurin]] desert.",
        "Uses": "Any item partially or wholly composed of zardazil became [[body phase|intangible]] to the first being whose blood it spilled, similar to the [[Lesser ironguard|''ironguard'']] spell. When this was done deliberately, it allowed a person to carry it without detection, typically attached to a non-metallic necklace. While it was in this state it did not harm the \"carrier\" and could not be affected by any spells such as ''[[heat metal]]'' or ''[[enlarge]]'' in an attempt to damage their person.\n\n[[Ardrethra Laurindar]], a professional slayer, as well as at least three [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] noble ladies were said to have used zardazil [[blade]]s in this manner."
