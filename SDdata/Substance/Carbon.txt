Carbon was an elemental material found in the Realms.
Carbon was commonly found in the near-pure forms of soot, charcoal, coke, and graphite. It was much more rarely encountered as diamonds, a pure and naturally forming kind of crystalline carbon.
Auroras Emporium sold amorphous carbon for 1 gp per  and graphitic carbon for 3 gp per , which were intended for the arcane uses of wizards.
The Elemental Store of Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental carbon for 2 gp per .
* Star metal was naturally composed of iron infused with carbon.
* Iron and steel used carbon in the alloying process to improve the metal. Too much would render the metal brittle and useless.
* The enchanted weapon weapon spell used some powdered carbon and lime.
