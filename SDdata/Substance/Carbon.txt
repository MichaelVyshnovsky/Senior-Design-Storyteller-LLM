'''Carbon''' was an elemental material found in the [[Realms]].

==Availability==
Carbon was commonly found in the near-pure forms of [[soot]], [[charcoal]], [[coke]], and [[graphite]].{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|61}} It was much more rarely encountered as [[diamond]]s, a pure and naturally forming kind of crystalline carbon.{{Cite dragon/248/Crystal Confusion|45}}{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-03-10/Diamonds as spell components}}

[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold amorphous carbon for 1 [[gp]] per {{SI|6|oz}} and [[graphitic carbon]] for 3 gp per {{SI|6|oz}}, which were intended for the arcane uses of [[wizard]]s.

The [[Elemental Store]] of [[Karsus Enclave]] sold pure elemental carbon for 2 gp per {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}}.

==Usages==
* [[Star metal]] was naturally composed of [[iron]] infused with carbon.{{Cite dragon/148/Always Wear Your Best Suit|17}}{{Cite dragon/123/Fire for Effect!|35}}
* [[Iron]] and [[steel]] used carbon in the alloying process to improve the metal. Too much would render the metal brittle and useless.{{Cite dragon/316/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Black Dwarf Mine|74-77}}
* The ''[[enchanted weapon]]'' weapon spell used some powdered carbon and [[Lime (material)|lime]].
