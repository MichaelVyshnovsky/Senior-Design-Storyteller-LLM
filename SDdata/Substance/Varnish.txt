Varnish, or lacquer, was a manufactured substance used for sealing and finishing other materials, similar to wax, enamel, pitch, and paint.
Varnish could be made from resins such as propolis, lakh resin, and lacquer tree resin, often thinned with terebinth.
Varnishes and lacquers were widely used as sealants for wood and other substances, especially as protection against wet and humid conditions such as in Chult. The wooden components of weapons and armor were usually varnished, as well as furniture and common tools. Metal could also be varnished to give it protection or decoration, as could leather, cloth, and ceramics.
