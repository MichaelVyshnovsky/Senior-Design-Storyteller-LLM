        "mainbody": "'''Petroleum''', also known as '''oil''', '''rock oil''',{{Cite organized play/LFR/Building the Pyre|15}} was a noxious and dangerous liquid mineral substance found in the [[Realms]]. Vaguely similar to common [[pitch]] and [[oil]]s derived from plants and animals, it instead came from beneath the earth and was a [[mineral oil]].",
        "Description": "Rock oil was a thick black liquid that gave off stinking, deadly fumes, and ignited and exploded very easily when exposed to flames and sparks,{{Cite dungeon/209/Tears of the Crocodile God|24}} producing a watery-looking flame and thick, greasy, stinking smoke when burned. Petroleum was considered a tremendous hazard when encountered underground in mines, akin to finding raw [[magnesium]].",
        "Availability": "Rock oil existed in deep underground deposits scattered across [[Faer√ªn]], and included naturally formed [[bitumen]]. On occasion, these deposits welled up and made themselves known on the surface, forming [[tar pit]]s or floating atop water, poisoning the ground and water around it. More commonly, the empty spaces of the [[Underdark]] interrupted the upward flow of the liquid, and so most revealed oil deposits were found in these deep caverns.\n\nExtremely large deposits of pooled rock oil could be found in the Underdark beneath the [[Eastern Shaar]], as well as south and east towards the [[Raurin]] desert and the [[Shining Lands]].\n\nSurface tar pits could be found across the Realms, and these surface deposits had a tendency to trap and drown animals like [[goat]]s and [[sheep]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/04-05 - Tar Pits in the Realms}} Tar pits could also form due to great magical forces, such as in the [[Helmlands]] and in [[Myrloch Vale]].\n\n[[Ventdiver]] [[fish]] contained notable amounts of rock oil in their swim bladders, making them a useful source of the material.",
        "Usage": "Rock oil was mainly known for being a natural hazard thanks to its poisonous and flammable nature.{{Cite dragon/81/Living in a material world|61}} and a variety known as gasoline was developed in [[Halruaa]] around the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/The Underground|15}} A refined form of oil known as naphtha was a useful flammable agent, finding use in [[alchemist's fire]], [[everburning oil]], ''[[oil of fiery burning]]'',{{Cite dragon/334/Fires of Alchemy|47}} [[flame thrower]]s,{{Cite dungeon/80/The Frothing Miscreant|31,37}} and similar devices.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|9}}"
