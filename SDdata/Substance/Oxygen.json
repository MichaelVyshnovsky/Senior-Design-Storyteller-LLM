        "mainbody": "Oxygen was an important elemental gas found in the Realms.\nIn , the Elemental Store of Karsus Enclave sold pure elemental oxygen gas for 2 gp per .\n* Living creatures ostensibly used oxygen in the air to stay alive, with the amount consumed based on the size of the creature and their level of exertion. Fire consumed it and could choke out confined spaces, and poisonous gases inflicted great harm upon those who sought to inhale oxygen. Spelljammers carried oxygen with them in their air envelope, allowing their crew to breathe.\n* Oxygen was used as a material component for magic related to breathing."
