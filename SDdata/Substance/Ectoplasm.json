        "mainbody": "Ectoplasm was an insubstantial substance that resulted from the use of psionics and some magic spells. It also formed the bodies of ghostly undead. Ectoplasm originated from the Astral Plane.\nEctoplasm took various forms, depending on how it was manifested. In its original form, it could appear smoky, diaphanous, or as finely spun strands. Things made of this form of ectoplasm were visible only as wispy outlines, appearing ghost-like. There were also semi-solid and solidified forms that were partially translucent and rippling. A crystalline form was also possible.\nIt was often grayish or silvery in hue, but other colors were possible depending on how it was shaped. It sometimes shimmered if it carried or resulted from a psionic effect\nEctoplasm was completely inert. For example, using wall of ectoplasm created solid ectoplasm that could not be bypassed by ethereal or incorporeal creatures. However, using certain psionic powers, unstable ectoplasm could be created that dissipated explosively, initially producing \"hellish\" flames and later different kinds of energy fire, cold, electricity, or sonic. It was composed of particles but could be drawn into writhing strands.\nEctoplasm existed naturally on the Astral Plane, and could be part of the fundamental matter that went into the creation of demiplanes via the genesis power or spell. It was even part of the astral ecosystem the spiders of an ectoplasmic swarm, which were native to the Astral Plane, produced raw ectoplasm as their waste and used raw ectoplasm to spin their webs.\nThe souls of those whod died but not moved on to the Outer Planes could, over the course of days or months, gather incorporeal ectoplasm around them to give themselves form. In this way, they became undead, such as incorporeal ghosts or allips or corporeal bodaks, and other undead like the incorporeal quells and ghost brutes. The latters ectoplasmic drool existed in both ethereal and corporeal forms, and dissipated on contact with non-living matter.\nWhen a part of the astral medium was drawn into the Material Plane, it became raw ectoplasm.\nthumb|left|A shaper fashioning a creature out of ectoplasm.\nPowers of the metacreativity discipline pulled raw ectoplasm and other matter from the Astral Plane for a psionics-user such as a shaper to fashion into objects and even pseudo-living constructs of their choosing. Such things were solid or semi-solid and as durable as normal matter, being held together by psionic energy for their duration. When ended or dispelled, they disappeared, leaving a few drops of liquid ectoplasm or a thin film of glistening ectoplasm that swiftly evaporated.\nThe ectoplasmic form power turned a being and what they wore or carried into ectoplasm. Originally, they could pass through solid matter like it wasnt there.\nThe dismiss ectoplasm power caused all affected ectoplasmic objects and creatures that could not resist to dissipate to their constituent ectoplasm and subsequently evaporate in several seconds. A being in ectoplasmic form had a 50% chance of being obliterated or transported to a random spot in the Astral Plane.\n\"Sophisticated\" psions understood that the sheen left by a material display of psionic manifestation was ectoplasm from the Astral Plane.\nIn the Gith language, \"rzyduun\" meant \"ectoplasmic blast\"."
