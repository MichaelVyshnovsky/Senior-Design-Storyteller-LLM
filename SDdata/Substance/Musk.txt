'''Musk''' was a pungent [[oil]] used by and harvested from certain animals due its powerful smell.

==Availability==
[[Aurora's Emporium]] sold a high-quality musk for 4 gp per {{SI|2|oz}} and [[civet]] musk for 10 gp per {{SI|1|oz}}, intended for use by [[priest]]s as an aromatic ritual reagent.

In [[Zakhara]], musk was exported from the islands of the [[Crowded Sea]] and the jungles of the eastern [[Ruined Kingdoms]] and [[Afyal]], particularly from the isle of [[Harab]].

Some plants could produce a kind of musk, and were grown in the basements of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Usage==

==Creatures==
[[File:Witherstench.png|right|thumb|250px|Witherstenches were lesser-known, but no less effective, purveyors of musk.]]

* [[Yellow musk creeper]]s produced a soporific dust that smelled like animal musk.
