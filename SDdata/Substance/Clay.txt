'''Clay''' was a common naturally-occurring kind of soil in [[Faer√ªn]] and beyond, often used to make useful and beautiful [[ceramic]] objects.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/12-22 - Crockery Materials}}

==Description==
[[File:Elemental Clay.png|thumb|200px|''Magically-imbued clay.'']]
Clay resembled thick mud or soft stone depending on how dry it was,{{Cite dragon/13/How Heavy Is My Giant|7}} It was a particularly difficult kind of soil to handle with tools, with even [[hoe]]s and [[plow]]s struggling to break through the stiff and heavy mass.

==Availability==
High-quality raw clay for use in magical spells and rituals was available for purchase through the ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 1 [[gold piece]] per {{SIAdj|1|lb|k|long=yes}}. Another variety was available for only 1 [[silver piece]] per pound, as well as {{SIAdj|1|inch|c|long=yes}} fired spheres for 1 [[copper piece]].

==Clay Deposits in the Realms==
* In the [[Abyss]], the cavernous [[Worm Realm]] was made up of earth, stone, and clay.
* In the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], there were rich clay pits along the banks of the [[River Shining]].
* Around [[Corm Orp]].
* The [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] was made up of various minerals, stones, and soils, with clays included.
* The northern reaches of the [[Stonelands]] were largely made up of dry soil unsuited to agriculture.

==Usage==

* Clay was commonly fired in kilns to make ceramic objects such as crockery, [[jar]]s, sculptures, and tiles, in varieties such as stoneware, earthenware, [[terracotta]], and [[porcelain]].
* Clay was used by scholars such as [[alchemist]]s and [[wizard]]s in their experiments, as it was a nonreactive substance that could be shaped as desired. Moist clay could be used to make heat-absorbing pads for holding hot vessels, shaped into temporary joins for [[glass]] piping, or moulded onto skin to protect against heat and [[acid]].
* Protective gear such as [[canvas]] [[apron]]s and [[gloves]] were steeped in clay, making them extra effective against acids, [[poison]]s, heat, and other hazards. Canvas sailcloth for ships could also be imbued with clay to make it more resistant to wind, water, [[salt]], and other threats to their integrity.
* Clay could be used as part of [[disguise kit]]s to alter facial features.
* [[Clay golem]]s were among the cheaper and simpler [[golem]]s that could be made.
* On the island nation of [[Wa]], clay was one of the two common materials used in the construction of buildings.
===Food===
* [[Fensir]] were known to eat some forms of clay.
* [[Magma beast]]s subsisted on clay, among other things.
===Spell Components===
* ''[[Conjure elemental]]'' required a small amount of soft clay if the caster wanted to use it to conjure an [[earth elemental]].
* ''[[Distance distortion]]'' used a small amount of soft clay.
* ''[[Earthquake]]'' used a lump of clay.<ref>
* ''[[Maximilian's earthen grasp]]'' required a miniature hand sculpted from clay.<ref>
