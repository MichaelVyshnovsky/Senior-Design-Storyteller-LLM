'''Demon ichor''' was a combination of blood, fluids, organs, and other internal remains of a deceased [[demon]].

It was found in large pools on the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], [[Avernus]], as that served as the main battleground of the [[Blood War]], where many demons were regularly slain.

==Properties==
The ichor of demons was a sticky, adherent substance that seemingly resembled bile It was typically black in color.

While the substance was largely harmless on many planes of existence, on the [[lower planes]] it had several transformative properties. If it came into contact with certain beings, aside from [[fiend]]s, [[:Category:Plant creatures|plants]], and [[undead]], demonic ichor could change their physical properties. Changes included increasing or decreasing in size, either wholly or a single appendage; the growth of eyes, horns, or a tail; or something as simple as a new hair color.

==Usages==
Many [[devil]]s and other fiendish creatures used demon ichor for certain rituals or as a means to improve their [[infernal war machine]]s.

Still others used it as a coating for their [[weapon]]s. It also acted as a [[poison]] that caused weakness.
===Spell Components===
* ''[[Spiritwrack]]'' required demon ichor as a [[material component]].
