'''Arambar''' was one of the [[primordial]]s who fought against the [[god]]s before the [[Tearfall|sundering]] of [[Abeir-Toril]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|170}}

==Appareance==
Arambar was a gigantic primordial with the size of a mountain and a vaguely humanoid form.

==History==
Arambar fought against the gods and was killed during the [[Tearfall|conflict]] that took place before the world of Abeir-Toril was divided into two twin worlds, [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], Arambar's corpse was left in the world of Abeir after the two worlds were separated, in the continent of [[Laerakond]] in the lands that would later will be known as [[Skelkor]]. The stones that made its corpse rearranged themselves each night, and some believed the spirit of Arambar was the one who changed the position of the stones as a way to mark the time left for some great event to happen.

Not long after the [[Arambar (energy)|residual energy]] from his corpse enveloped Abeir, causing the ''Steelsky''. 

Eventually, a group of escaped slaves from Skelkor founded a village in the remains of Arambar named [[Wandering Stones]]. Dragons who knew the town was near the resting place of Arambar, shunned the place out of fear.

During the [[Spellplague]], a broken fist of Arambar buried in [[Ithimir Isle]] was transported to Toril along with the isle.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|35}}

In [[1479 DR]], the spirit of Arambar briefly awakened to protect the adventuress [[Jada Marlserpent]], the [[shaman]] [[Olothon]], and the inhabitants of the Wandering Stones village from the attack of the [[brown dragon]] [[Thovantareth]].
