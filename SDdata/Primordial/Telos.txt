'''Telos''', also known as the '''Master of the Iron Sky''', was a sleeping [[primordial]] located beneath [[Telos City]] in [[Vaasa]] during the 15th century [[DR]]. This entity was the [[warlock patron|source]] of the [[Warlock Knights]]' power.

==Description==
Publicly, Telos was venerated by the Warlock Knights during the 15th century DR, and some commonfolk believed that Telos was the Knights' enigmatic leader. In truth, Telos was comatose and immobile ever since its arrival on [[Toril]],

Telos' body was made of ''[[ironfell]]'', a [[magic]]al metal-like substance which would quickly regenerate if it was removed. This material was mined extensively by the Warlock Knights to make their weapons, armor, and [[ironfell ring|distinctive rings]].

==History==
Telos arrived on Toril by falling to the Vaasan tundra as a "[[meteor|shooting star]]" during the [[Spellplague]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} and left Telos in a seemingly permanent catatonic state. The one who first discovered the promordial ended up adopting the title of the [[Voice of Telos]], and founded the organization that would become the Warlock Knights. The Knights soon began to mine Telos's body for ''ironfell'' and learned how to siphon its power.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}} and ultimately seized control of the realm by the {{YearlinkName|1470}}.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

At some point in the 15th century DR, [[Telos City]] was constructed in the primordial's impact crater, with the [[Citadel of the Iron Sky]] built directly over the body. This city was the headquarters of the Warlock Knights and the home of the Voice of Telos, and it became the capital of Vaasa as well as the center of a growing religious-like veneration of the primordial. 

==Worshipers==
Under the Warlock Knights, veneration of Telos was practiced in Vaasa, and this was the only permissible faith in Telos City. Services were held in the Citadel of the Iron Sky, and a priest-like sect of warlocks called [[Luminaries]], led by the Voice of Telos, presided over the faith and maintained Telosian temples and shrines across the realm.

Despite this veneration, the Warlock Knights' relationship with Telos was decidedly more parasitic than pious. The Knights gained their powers by draining it form the unconscious primordial in order to wield it for their own. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a rift had begun to form among the Knights between those led by the Voice of Telos, who wished to heed the will of Telos as understood through the primordial's dreams, and those led by Knight-Vindicator [[Mansard Kanaoth]], who wished to use the primordial solely as a tool.

It was not unheard of for Warlock Knights to worship [[Bane]] secretly in addition to or instead of Telos.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|5,7}}

===Pacts===
The Warlock Knights tapped into Telos' power with the use of [[Warlock#Star_Pact.2C_the_Great_Old_One|star pacts]], of which there were two main types:

The more common pact&mdash;known as the [[Ironfell Pact]]{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|11}}&mdash;was the one used by the Warlock Knights themselves to steal the primordial's power. Those who took this Pact found themselves unable to divulge secrets about Telos or the [[Ironfell Council]].

Less common was the pact formed by the [[Nishaadhri]], also called the Bound Ones. These were often [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasters compelled to swear fealty to the Warlock Knights in order to be allowed to practice their [[Magic|Art]]. In addition, they formed a special pact with Telos which granted them powers more akin to [[wizards]] or [[priests]], and the most powerful of these warlocks would be recruited as Luminaries. The Bound Ones' powers manifested as glowing purple tendrils.

It was strongly implied that the [[Voice of Telos]] had a unique pact with the primordial which granted him seemingly unlimited ''[[telepathy]]'', extended his life, and generally bestowed him with sufficient power to rule the Warlock Knights.
