        "Description": "Originally, Achazar had the form of a swirling column of fire that burned so hot that even fire-breathing [[dragon]]s feared to come too close to him. After he fell asleep, he took the shape of a static, ever-burning cylindrical pillar of fire about 100 foot (30 meters) high.",
        "History": "After the primordials were sent to [[Abeir]], Achazar ruled over the lands later known as the Windrise Ports.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|50-52}}\n\nAs time passed on, Achazar began to move less and less, troubling his slaves on a few occasions. One day, centuries before the Spellplague, Achazar stopped completely and fell into a deep sleep and never woke again. When the slaves realized that Achazar didn't answer to their inquiries, they declared themselves free. Dragons still shunned the Windrise Ports out of fear of Achazar, who slept in the form of a giant pillar of fire amid [[Tarmalune]], allowing the Windrise Ports to grow in wealth and influence across Abeir. As of [[1479 DR]], most locals didn't know what the burning pillar in the center of Tarmalune really was, and sailors used Achazar as a sort of beacon to navigate the [[Dragon Sea (Abeir)|Dragon Sea]], since his light shone brightly day and night regardless of weather.\n\nHowever, although Achazar was sleeping, he was still somewhat aware of his surroundings. He was able to harm those he disliked or aid those he favored, no matter how distant those individuals were from the site of the fiery pillar.{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|53}} Some evil cults, such as the [[Cult of Reborn Flame]], paid homage to him and tried to awake him once more.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|35}}\n\nWithin Achazar's consciousness lived a mysterious [[sphinx]] named [[Firaleene]], who had been dwelling there since Achazar fell asleep and transformed into the pillar of fire.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Pyrophobia|18}}"
