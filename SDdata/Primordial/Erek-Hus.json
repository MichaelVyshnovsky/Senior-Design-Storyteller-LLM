        "mainbody": "rek-Hus, also known as The King of Terror, was one of the primordials who fought against the gods during the Dawn War.\nAccording to the few dragonborn of Abeir who believed in gods, the dragon god Asgorath (known in Abeir by the name of Io) fought alone against Erek-Hus during the Dawn War, and the primordial killed him by cutting Asgorath in twain with his giant adamantine axe. Some claim Asgorath died in that battle because the god Zehir betrayed him to Erek-Hus, because Zehir wanted to control the Dragon domain.\nZehirs plan was destined to fail, however, as no sooner Asgorath had died, his two halves rose up as the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who joined forces for the only time in their lives and killed Erek-Hus before the primordial had even a chance to celebrate his victory.\nHis primary weapon was an adamantine axe which was used to kill Io."
