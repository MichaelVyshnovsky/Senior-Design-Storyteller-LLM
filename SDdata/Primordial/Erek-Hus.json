        "History": "According to the few [[dragonborn]] of [[Abeir]] who believed in gods, the [[dragon]] god [[Asgorath]] (known in Abeir by the name of [[Io]]) fought alone against Erek-Hus during the Dawn War, and the primordial killed him by cutting Asgorath in twain with his giant [[adamantine]] axe. Some claim Asgorath died in that battle because the god [[Zehir]] betrayed him to Erek-Hus, because Zehir wanted to control the [[Dragon domain]].\n\nZehir's plan was destined to fail, however, as no sooner Asgorath had died, his two halves rose up as the dragon gods [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]], who joined forces for the only time in their lives and killed Erek-Hus before the primordial had even a chance to celebrate his victory.",
        "Possessions": "His primary weapon was an [[adamantine]] axe which was used to kill Io."
