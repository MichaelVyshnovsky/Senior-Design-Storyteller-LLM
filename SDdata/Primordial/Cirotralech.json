        "mainbody": "Cirotralech was an obscure primordial who slept in the caves beneath the section of Howling Mountains located in Fimbrul, Laerakond.\nIt was believed that Cirotralech had multiple heads. At least one was made of fire, and another of ice.\nCirotralech was entombed in Fimbrul alongside his consort, a titan known as the Bride, and his other servants.\nIn 1480 DR, a small cult of those madmen, known as the Sons of Winter, led by the scholar Rathloff, attempted to awaken Cirotralech, and there is a possibility that they may have succeeded."
