        "mainbody": "The primordials, or Dawn Titans, were god-like beings made of manifest entropy and elemental energy whose domains were the Elemental Chaos and Abeir, unlike the gods (Estelar), whose domains were the Astral Sea and Toril.\nAo created the multiverse from the raw material of the Phlogiston, and within the sphere several worlds drifted upon the Sea of Night. The worlds contained no life, but they were coveted by powerful beings who arose from the Elemental Chaos, known today as the primordials. The beautiful goddesses of light and dark, Selûne and Shar, formed from the ocean of silvery liquid left over from the realms creation (the Astral Sea), unbeknownst to the primordials. They defended the new worlds from the primordials, naturally as the primordials were beings of entropy and destruction. Thus began the Dawn War, and other gods were created from the residue of the conflict or summoned from other dimensions to help the native gods of Realmspace.\nDuring the time known as the Blue Age, a race of sea creatures were living on Abeir-Toril in the planets single vast ocean. The Blue Age came to an end when a primordial known as Dendar the Night Serpent swallowed the sun, giving way to the Shadow Epoch. Sarrukh myths and legends tell of great battles during this time between the primordials and the Elder Gods led by Ouroboros the World Serpent. The war turned in the gods favor when the primordial Ubtao the Deceiver assisted the elder gods in slaying, imprisoning, or driving away the remaining primordials.\nCirca , during the Days of Thunder and near the end of the Batrachi civilization, the amphibious creator race was waging a losing war against the titans descended from Annam All-Father. Desperate, the Batrachi summoned several primordials, which released them from their imprisonment. The gods quickly attacked their ancient foes, and the Dawn Titans were defeated, and a few even slaughtered, in a cataclysmic period known as the Tearfall. During the fighting, Ao himself intervened when the primordial Asgorath the World Shaper hurled an ice moon at Abeir-Toril, wanting to destroy the world she couldnt claim as her own. Ao then sundered the world into two new, twin worlds called Abeir and Toril. He granted the primordials control of the world of Abeir and the gods control of the original world, Toril.\nThe few primordials who survived retreated to Abeir, tired of conflict. Their dragon slave-steeds then rose on rebellion, igniting the War of Fang and Talon that killed even more primordials, Meanwhile, the remaining Dawn Titans retreated into the mountains of Abeir and fell silent. From that point on, Abeir was ruled by dragons until recent times, when the Spellplague transferred a continent called Laerakond from Abeir onto Toril. As of the , a few surviving Dawn Titans from Abeir were sleeping in the mountains of Laerakond called Fimbrul.\nThere were a few primordials who never fought the gods and chose to remain in Toril when Abeir split away. Five such primordials were elemental lords and ruled over the Inner Planes, worshiped like gods. All were true neutral in alignment except Bazim-Gorag, who was chaotic evil.\nAkadi\n Akadi, the Queen of the Air, was the ruler of the air element.\nBazim-Gorag\n Bazim-Gorag the Firebringer, Lord of the Pandemonium Stone, wasnt originally a primordial. He ascended to that status sometime after the Spellplague. His portfolios were chance and chaos, and he was invoked by gamblers and anyone who wanted the impossible.\nGrumbar\n Grumbar, the Lord of the Earth, was the ruler of the earth element. His domain was Root Hold.\nIstishia\n Istishia, the Lord of Water, was the ruler of the water element. He cared not about Umberlees storms or Valkurs sailors. His domain was the Cresting Spires.\nKossuth\n Kossuth, the Lord of Fire, was the ruler of the fire element. His domain was the Undying Pyre.\nThe \"Seven Lost Gods\" was a term used to describe various groups of powerful entities at different times. Some of these entities might have been primordials, and candidates included Dendar the Night Serpent, Kezef the Chaos Hound, Maram of the Great Spear, and Borem of the Boiling Mud.\nThere existed many other elemental beings who were confirmed as primordials\nAchazar the Pillar of Wrath\n A fire primordial that ruled Tarmalune in Abeir.

It was among the most hated and feared primordials before Ao twinned the world. It was defeated in Abeir by dragons sometime before the Battle of the Crippled Mountain, and went to hide in the Howling Mountains of Laerakond.\nBwimb\n An evil archomental of ooze, Bwimb was considered a great general of the planes in ages past.\n Cirotralech\n A multi-headed primordial who was sleeping in the Howling Mountains of Laerakond.\n Cryonax\n The Prince of evil creatures of elemental cold and ice. \nDur-baagal\n An ice primordial killed by Auril.\nDraunn\n An earth primordial.
