        "Description": "Nehushta was a massive being made of different metallic alloys who shined star-white when roused to fury. Over the years, she modified her own body with fantastic assemblages of gears, blades, and other [[golem]]-like improvements.",
        "History": "[[Genasi]] from the world of [[Abeir]] believed Nehushta was the creator of both Abeiran and [[Toril]]ian genasi, having created them in the dawn of time to serve as her slaves. Members of the [[Dominion of the Burned|Burned]] believed themselves to be direct descendants of the original genasi crafted by the primordial.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} The ancient [[artifact]] known as the [[Birthing Furnace]] was a creation of Nehushta as well, lending credence to those claims.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|79}} Nehushta was also credited as the creator of the dreaded [[anaxim]]s.{{Cite dragon/366/Gontal|51}}\n\nBefore the separation of [[Abeir-Toril]], Nehushta erected the fortress of [[Glaur]] in the northern lands of [[Gontal]] to serve as a central front during the Dawn War.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|84}}\n\nEven when she was reported as dead by the dragons of Abeir, scholars debated whether if this was actually true or not, and many believed  a living remnant of Nehushta herself was hidden in the ruins of Glaur."
