        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-359}}, Borem became active after long years of appearing as a simple muddy river. After a hot summer, the river broke its banks and became a lake in the space of a tenday of rainfall. In their quest for godhood, the adventurers [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]] and [[Myrkul]] attacked Borem in his home plane after making the connection between him and the river. Killing him, they stole his heart, which they bore to [[Mezeketh Isle]] and buried."
