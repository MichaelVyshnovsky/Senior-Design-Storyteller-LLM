'''Entropy''' was a [[primordial]],{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta}} who was for a time an aspect of [[Tiamat]].

==History==
When [[Ao]] banished the [[primordial]]s to [[Abeir]] he imprisoned '''Entropy''' in the form of a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' and placed him on [[Toril]] as a warning to the gods that they faced annihilation if they did not behave.

In [[1346 DR]], Entropy got a following in [[Chessenta]] when a ''sphere of annihilation'' appeared in [[House Karanok]]'s torture chamber and annihilated the [[wizard]] they were torturing there. House Karanok started worshiping it and by [[1370 DR]], [[Tiamat]] took the aspect of Entropy and the sphere didn't only create five smaller ones, but actually started to grant spells.

Entropy's faithful maintained a temple in [[Bezantur]] known as the [[House of Entropy]].

With [[Mystra]]'s death and the subsequent [[Spellplague]], Entropy was freed from his prison and grew stronger, threatening to devour the universe. He was worshiped in [[Chessenta]] by the [[Cult of Entropy]] and dwelt in the [[Maw of the God Swallower]] in southern Chessenta in [[1479 DR]].

==Notable followers==
* [[Entropist]]: These clerics of Entropy specialized in the usage of ''spheres of annihilation''.
