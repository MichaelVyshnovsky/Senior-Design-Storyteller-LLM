House Karanok started worshiping it and by 1370 DR, Tiamat took the aspect of Entropy and the sphere didnt only create five smaller ones, but actually started to grant spells.\nEntropys faithful maintained a temple in Bezantur known as the House of Entropy.\nWith Mystras death and the subsequent Spellplague, Entropy was freed from his prison and grew stronger, threatening to devour the universe. He was worshiped in Chessenta by the Cult of Entropy and dwelt in the Maw of the God Swallower in southern Chessenta in 1479 DR.\n* Entropist These clerics of Entropy specialized in the usage of spheres of annihilation."
