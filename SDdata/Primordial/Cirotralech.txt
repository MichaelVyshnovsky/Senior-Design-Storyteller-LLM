'''Cirotralech''' was an obscure [[primordial]] who slept in the caves beneath the section of [[Howling Mountains]] located in [[Fimbrul]], [[Laerakond]].

==Appearance==
It was believed that Cirotralech had multiple heads. At least one was made of fire, and another of ice.

==History==
Cirotralech was entombed in Fimbrul alongside his consort, a [[titan]] known as the [[Bride]], and his other servants.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|6}}

In [[1480 DR]], a small cult of those madmen, known as the [[Sons of Winter]], led by the scholar [[Rathloff]], attempted to awaken Cirotralech, and there is a possibility that they may have succeeded.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|36}}
