Karshimis was a primordial overlord of the land of Shyr, in the world of Abeir.
Karshimis was one of the primordials who went into hibernation during the War of Fang and Talon, and many years after that he awoke and became the despotic overlord of the continent of Shyr. He ruled his lands ruthlessly and both his slaves near the lands that were known in Toril as Akanûl.
After the Spellplague, with both Akanûl and Laerakond transported to Toril, what happened with Karshimis and his kingdom became a mystery.
