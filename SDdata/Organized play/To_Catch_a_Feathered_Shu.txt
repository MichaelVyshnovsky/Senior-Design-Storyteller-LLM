{{Quote|''The chief of the [[Jengi]] tribe, [[Futori]], puts out the word that the Jengi requires help. The heroes can come from any of the other tribes but they will find a village in terrible shape. Not only are the huts all broken, but the chief will explain that there are other problems as well. He would like the heroes to help the tribe solve the problems. During the entire encounter and introduction the [[shu]] will be visibly terrified of the heroes unless they are shu. They will
huddle in the wreckage of their village in small groups attempting to avoid the heroes.''|}}

==Summary==
After strange earth tremors, the [[witch doctor]] of the [[shu]] [[Jengi]] tribe, [[Kumon Ubok]], was gravely hurt and in need of magical healing, using the ''[[healing dream]]''. As the shu was laying hurt, less knowable shu attempted to harness the magic of the witch doctor's ''[[spell fetish]]es'' which led to the chaos of ''[[wild magic]]'' across the village: a giant tree that grew in the middle of the village, a shu sprouting feathers and flying around the hilltop nearby, among other magical disasters that took place. The heroes of the Living Jungle arrived from afar to aid the shu tribe in distress.
