        "mainbody": "Trembling Village is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. It was intended for a group of low/mid level heroes.\nTerrible earthquakes began rumbling across the Living Jungles. Bengoukee saw them as a terrible sign of dark things to come. The village of Kaltra was ruined in the tremors and the Lake of Many Fish on which it stood became a mud pit. The heroes of the Living Jungle were sent on a 300-mile journey across the Malatran Plateau to find the refugees and escort them to safety of the Koshiva tribe village. The refugees faced attacks from deinonychus, garuda dogs, and sailbacks on the journey but eventually reached their new home.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \nLocations\n •  •  •  • \n • \nOrganizations\n •  • \nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  • \nMiscellaneous\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •"
