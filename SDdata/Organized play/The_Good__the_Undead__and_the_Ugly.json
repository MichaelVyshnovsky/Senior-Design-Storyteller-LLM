It was published in March 2001, and is Part III of the Flight of Arrows series. It intended for adventurers of 3-12 levels.\nAfter the Zhentarim splinter dissident group – the Flight of Arrows, was granted asylum by the Lady Lord Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden of Ravens Bluff, the group was ambushed and ensorcelled with a deadly combination of a curse and geas that left the members of the Flight unable to fight nor defend themselves. The aide to the mayor, Karran Mystamere, tasked a group of hand-picked heroes to get aid from a powerful priest, secretly an archlich. The group traveled to Mossbridges and Kings Reach, eventually tracking Athoomb to the Troll Mountains. The heroes were able to secure the archlichs help via payment of magic items or a debt of servitude. Subsequently, the adventurers faced another ambush by the Zhentish Red Shadows, who sought to assassinate Athoomb before he could lift the geas.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials\n •  •  • \nWeapons\n •  •  • \nOther\n •"
