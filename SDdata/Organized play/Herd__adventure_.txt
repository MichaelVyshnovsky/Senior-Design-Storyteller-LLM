{{Quote|''A herd of [[garuda]] are trampling the jungle, heading straight for the village of the [[Rudra]], and [[Bengoukee]] asks you, the heroes of [[Malatra]], to stop them. But how ... now that's the strange part... An adventure for heroes of any level.''|}}

==Summary==
In the Year of Tigers Curse ([[1374 DR]]), the Chief of the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]], old [[Bengoukee]], contacted a group of heroes of the [[Living Jungle]] through a dream and asked for the help in stopping an unnatural [[garuda]] stampede that threatened the [[Rudra]] tribe. Heroes guided to the mysterious [[Spirit Cave]] where they were transformed into garuda, ready to infiltrate the deadly herd. Soon, the disguised heroes discovered that the herd was magically led by a massive [[flesh lizard]] wearing a seemingly indestructible [[amulet]] that belonged to ostracized [[sorcerer]] of the menaced tribe – [[Halussa]]. After removing ''[[Halussa's ruby]]'' from the flesh lizard, the herd quickly dispersed and the garuda heroes confronted the malicious sorcerer.
