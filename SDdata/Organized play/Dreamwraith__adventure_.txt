Dreamwraith is a one-round tournament adventure module designed by Richard L. Dold and set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1996, and intended for adventurers of all levels.
In 1369 DR, a group of adventurers returned to the Living City from the mysterious land of Ravenloft after being missing for five years. Soon, however, one of the Domains of Dread survivors fell victim to a creature called a dreamwraith. Emeline Carpenter, a bard of Ravens Bluff, was trapped in the world of dreams, fighting for her life, while several of the other survivors of Ravenloft fell prey to the wraith. Desperate for help, Emeline prayed to her deity – Oghma, who sent a vision and an animated dragon figurine to guide a group of adventurers to the bard. Subsequently, the adventurers realized that killing or removing the wraith from Emelines body in the real world would kill her. They had to venture into the dreaming and slay the creature and its servants there.
