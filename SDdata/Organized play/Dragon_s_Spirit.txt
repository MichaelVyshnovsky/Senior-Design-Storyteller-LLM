==Summary==
In winter [[1373 DR]], a group of goodly [[dragon]]s was ambushed and slaughtered by minions of [[Tiamat]]. One of the victims was [[Venthmansus]]. The [[geomancer]] from [[Ravens Bluff]] named [[Carmanstansos]] felt the dying dragon's essence and assembled a group of Living City adventurers to investigate the visions of death and destruction. They magically traveled to the village of [[Hidden Hollow]], ruined around three months earlier, via Carmanstansos' [[pseudodragon]]s. They were just in time to see Ven pass. The dying dragon begged the adventurers to take his ''Shen'' and deliver it to the [[Temple of Dragons]] dedicated to [[Bahamut]]. Along the way, the adventurers were pursued by a [[white dragon noble]] servant of Tiamat. [[Frostrage]] was not the only one who sought to steal Ven's ''Shen''. An ambitious member of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] – [[Grumman Talkon]] pursued them to the temple. Finally, the heroes were allowed entrance despite not being dragons. After the final confrontation, they delivered Ven to the draconic afterlife. Now, they had to find the [[Dragon Sage]] and inform him of the sinister threat of Tiamat.
