Dragons Spirit is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program, Part I of the Cycle of Dragons series. It was published in 2000, and intended for adventurers of all levels.
In winter 1373 DR, a group of goodly dragons was ambushed and slaughtered by minions of Tiamat. One of the victims was Venthmansus. The geomancer from Ravens Bluff named Carmanstansos felt the dying dragons essence and assembled a group of Living City adventurers to investigate the visions of death and destruction. They magically traveled to the village of Hidden Hollow, ruined around three months earlier, via Carmanstansos pseudodragons. They were just in time to see Ven pass. The dying dragon begged the adventurers to take his Shen and deliver it to the Temple of Dragons dedicated to Bahamut. Along the way, the adventurers were pursued by a white dragon noble servant of Tiamat. Frostrage was not the only one who sought to steal Vens Shen. An ambitious member of the Cult of the Dragon – Grumman Talkon pursued them to the temple. Finally, the heroes were allowed entrance despite not being dragons. After the final confrontation, they delivered Ven to the draconic afterlife. Now, they had to find the Dragon Sage and inform him of the sinister threat of Tiamat.
