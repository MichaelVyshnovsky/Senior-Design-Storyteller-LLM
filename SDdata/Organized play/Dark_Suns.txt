Dark Suns is an adventure module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 3 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network and a crossover with RPGA Dark Sun series of adventures.
In The Year of Despair, Roshink, an earth elemental noble transported a group of the heroes of the Living Jungle to the world of Athas. The dying world was the fate that was to become Malatras unless the Tamara were stopped. The heroes were to experience the horror firsthand. Right after transportation, they fell into the hands of that worlds slaver elves and had to figure a way out of the cages before the heroes would end up sold into slavery and never see Malatra ever again. They managed to escape with the help from a thri-kreen named Kacha and escaped as the elven caravan was ravaged by a sink worm. Kacha escorted the group to his tribe –  Windrunners, who gifted them supplies and pointed toward the way out of the dying world – a great tree in the Ringing Forest. Subsequently, they met Miralte the Wolf, the leader of a peaceful oasis town called The Last Oasis, and were ambushed by Athasian halfling cannibals. Luckily, the ambush in the Ringing Forest ended up transferring the heroes across the Dreamlands back to Malatra and to Roshink.
