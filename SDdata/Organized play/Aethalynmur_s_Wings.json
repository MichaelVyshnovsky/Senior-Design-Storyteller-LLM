        "mainbody": "Aethalynmurs Wings is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1997 and is intended for adventurers of all levels. The later module Aethalynmurs Plight is a sequel to this one.\nIts a slow day in Ravens Bluff, with no more than some kobold bandits to round up outside the city gate and the adventurers stopping by the Downunder Patisserie for snacks. But once there, the solar Aethalynmur appears and recruits them to save Nimbus City in a demi-plane of the Elemental Plane of Air, from being terrorized by two rogue clerics and twin brothers from Oerth, Alsgo and Pardo who seek components for a powerful spell with which to conquer Greyhawk. After arriving in Nimbus, the heroes explore the planar city, battle mephits and manticores, as well as chaggrin, meet a cloud-sculpting sylph and rescue a ki-rin, and more. Once done, they return via a third city, Harmony, and are transported back to Ravens Bluff."
