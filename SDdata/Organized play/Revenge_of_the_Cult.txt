Revenge of the Cult is a one-round tournament Planar Adventure module designed by Michael White and set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 2000, and intended for adventurers high levels.
In 1373 DR, a mighty dracolich was sent by the Cult of the Dragon to aid Myrkyssa Jelan in her war with the Vast. However, through a heroic sacrifice, the undead wyrm was bound to a valley east of Ravens Bluff, near the village of Grey Hills. In 1373 DR, two planar powers, gith named Ilkaren Tysor who served the Silver Mask, and planetar Lithuriel who served Garthiel, became aware of planar magics being worked in the valley. The Cult of the Dragon and the Church of Tiamat allied for some nefarious reason under the leadership of mage Bediss, who entered a pact with a powerful fiend Verigrim. The pacts payment was opening a gate into the Elemental Plane of Water. A group of heroes was sent to the eastern town to investigate the strange planar magic. Along the way, the adventurers looked into many disappearances of Grey Hillss children, who were massacred by the sadistic dracolich. The heroes faced mercenaries and forces of the Cult and, possibly, slew the undead wyrm. In the end, the intel on the Cult was delivered to the Silver Mask and to the city of Ravens Bluffs officials.
