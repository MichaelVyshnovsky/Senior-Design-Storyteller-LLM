        "mainbody": "he Curse of Red Death is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in March 1992 as the eighth Living City tournament module and is intended for adventurers of any level.\nIn the early-to-mid 14 century DR, Sir Ian Glae James Graham wed Lady Holly. To celebrate the event, the happy couple exchanged wedding gifts. The bride used stone shape to shape red marble into a sword. Eventually, Sir Graham met his doom fighting a group of clerics of Talos. As he laid dying in a ravine, Tyr decided to reward the paladin by merging his soul with the Red Death bastard sword. Ten years later, a drunken Talassan priest was heard bragging of a paladins death, and the rumor reached Holly Graham, who ran a cidery outside of Ravens Bluffs walls. She tracked a band of trustworthy adventurers and asked them to investigate the rumors and find out her long-lost husbands fate.\nThe adventurers followed the rumors of Talassan activity as it led them to the same ravine where Sir Graham died, where clerics established a stronghold and were planning to move against Ravens Bluff. Subsequently, the heroes defeated a group of evil priests after convincing an old hermit to return the magic sword he had hidden a decade before. With Red Deaths help, the adventurers persevered and returned the sentient weapon to Holly. Once the bastard sword met Hollys hand, her lost husband reappeared in flesh and blood, looking like he had not aged in a decade.\n •  •  • \n • \n •  •  •  •  • \n • \nItems\n • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drink\nMaterials\n •  • \nWeapons\n • \nOther\n •  •"
