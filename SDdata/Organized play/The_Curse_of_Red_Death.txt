'''''The Curse of Red Death''''' is a one round adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in March 1992 as the eighth Living City tournament module and is intended for adventurers of any level.

==Synopsis==
In the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Sir [[Ian Glae James Graham]] wed [[Holly Graham|Lady Holly]]. To celebrate the event, the happy couple exchanged wedding gifts. The bride used ''[[stone shape]]'' to shape [[red marble]] into a [[sword]]. Eventually, Sir Graham met his doom fighting a group of [[cleric]]s of [[Talos]]. As he laid dying in a ravine, [[Tyr]] decided to reward the [[paladin]] by merging his soul with the ''[[Red Death]]'' [[bastard sword]]. Ten years later, a drunken [[Talassan]] priest was heard bragging of a paladin's death, and the rumor reached Holly Graham, who ran a [[cider]]y outside of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s walls. She tracked a band of trustworthy adventurers and asked them to investigate the rumors and find out her long-lost husband's fate.
The adventurers followed the rumors of Talassan activity as it led them to the same ravine where Sir Graham died, where clerics established a stronghold and were planning to move against Ravens Bluff. Subsequently, the heroes defeated a group of evil priests after convincing an old hermit to return the magic sword he had hidden a decade before. With ''Red Death's'' help, the adventurers persevered and returned the sentient weapon to Holly. Once the bastard sword met Holly's hand, her lost husband reappeared in flesh and blood, looking like he had not aged in a decade.
