A Smugglers Life for Me is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program.  It debuted at Con Man 94 and was later reprinted in Polyhedron #113 under the title A Pirates Life for Me, though with heavy edits to remove all connections to the Forgotten Realms setting.
