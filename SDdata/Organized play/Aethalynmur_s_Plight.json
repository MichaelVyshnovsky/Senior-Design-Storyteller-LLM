        "mainbody": "ethalynmurs Plight is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1999 and is intended for adventurers of all levels. It is a sequel to Aethalynmurs Wings and uses material from The Great Glacier.\nA warm summers day in Ravens Bluff sees the adventurers stopping by the Downunder Patisserie for free cake and lemonade. But no sooner do they arrive than the sylph Rahmare appears and recruits them to search for the lost solar, Aethalynmur. Her blind teleportation spell puts them in a cold day on the Great Glacier, where they clash with a tirichik, avoid an avalanche, and are aided by arctic dwarves. They arrive in the Iulutiun village of Yinntut, where they receive information and supplies and participate in a traditional singdown contest. Afterward, their journey to Mount Akka takes them past a remorhaz, penguins, werebears, and polar bears. Finally, they reach the cave home of some frost giants, who are keeping Aethalynmur prisoner on behalf of a demon called Rek. By bribery or battle, they rescue Aethalynmur and return to Ravens Bluff."
