{{Quote|''In a city built on closely guarded secrets, nothing goes unnoticed—including the strange disappearance of some of the town's poorest residents. While some remain indifferent to the plight of the missing, a [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watchman]] is determined to give justice to those who have nothing else. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in [[Waterdeep]] for characters levels 4-7.''|}}
