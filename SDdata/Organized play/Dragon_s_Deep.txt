{{quote|''Heading home from a mission in the Moonshae Isles you pass through the fabled City of Splendors, Waterdeep. Struggling to understand the dragon prophecy your party finds themselves caught into the intrigue, suspense and murder that has made this city famous. With the way that your luck has been recently, you might even see the Under mountain before this leg of your journey is over. This is a 2 Time Unit event. Part 3 in the Cycle of Dragons Series for Tiers One through Six.''}}

==Summary==
[[Whisper (shadow dragon)|Whisper]], a [[shadow dragon]] prince servant of [[Tiamat]], was sent to the City of Splendors in the {{YearlinkName|1371}} to build a network of spies and thieves under the name of "The Shadowed Man." He aimed to discover the identities of the [[Masked Lords]] of Waterdeep. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the ambassador of [[Ravens Bluff]] in Waterdeep was killed. A group of heroes from the Living City was tasked with the delivery of his family's ''[[rod of resurrection]]'' to return [[Chalnath Tressoon]] to the land of the living. The ''rod'', however, was quickly snatched by Whisper and his [[Shadowhands (guild)|Shadowhands]]. The heroes embarked on a quest to find the elusive "Shadowed Man," aided by a secret Masked Lord, the [[bard]] named [[Danilo Thann]], and Lady Mage of Waterdeep in disguise. Eventually, the search brought them to [[Undermountain]], where the shadow dragon made his lair. After a confrontation, Whisper was slain, leaving behind the third of the fabled ''[[dragons stones]]'', taken from the bodies of Tiamat's princes. The next stop was the city of [[Westgate]] to find the ambassador's brother.
