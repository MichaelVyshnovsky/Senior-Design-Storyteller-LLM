Before you knew what was really happening, you wound up in the middle of an information exchange, and now you have to escape from the lands of Sembia to preserve your very lives! Off the beaten path to shake any pursuers, you take to the wilds in the hope that you'll reach a safe haven before you're captured. ''Escape from Sembia'' is a Forgotten Realms adventure for five 1{{st}}-level characters and is a preview of the 4{{th}} Edition D&D game. The adventure has several decision points, but mostly consists of linear encounters that allow players to try out their characters' abilities and learn the game.''}}",
