It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for low-level and mid-level characters.\nIn the Year of Gathering Darkness, late 14 century DR, a swarm of nocturnal carnivorous valley ants left the Valley of Spirits and started ravaging their way across the Malatran Plateau. The adventurers came across a group of jungle tamhi and recovered two saru children whose mother was consumed by her ravenous ants. The group agrees to deliver the children to their father, who lived in a nameless saru village on the shored of the Dreaming River. There, the group realized that the mysterious ravenous force was a swarm of ants that devoured all living things in their way and the saru village was their next target. Subsequently, the heroes of the Living Jungle repealed the insects, saving the village. As a reward, the saru chieftain Mokka offered the heroes the honor of naming the saru village.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nLocations\n •  •  • \nOrganizations\nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  • \nItems\n • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  • \n •"
