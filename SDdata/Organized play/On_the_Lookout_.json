        "mainbody": "'''''On the Lookout!''''' is a tournament module set in ''Malatra – Living Jungle'' using the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 2{{rd}} edition ruleset. It is part of the ''[[Living Jungle]]'' series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for low-level and mid-level characters.\n\n{{Quote|''Far below the [[Valley of Spirits]] has evolved a species of [[ant]] unlike any seen on the [[Malatran Plateau]]. Much\nlarger than common ants, they are single-minded carnivores who devour anything in their path. They poured into the Valley of the Spirits itself. Now they march across Malatra, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.''|}}",
        "Summary": "In the Year of Gathering Darkness, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a swarm of nocturnal carnivorous [[valley ant]]s left the Valley of Spirits and started ravaging their way across the Malatran Plateau. The adventurers came across a group of [[jungle tam'hi]] and recovered two [[saru]] children whose mother was consumed by her ravenous ants. The group agrees to deliver the children to their father, who lived in a nameless saru village on the shored of the [[Dreaming River]]. There, the group realized that the mysterious ravenous force was a swarm of ants that devoured all living things in their way and the saru village was their next target. Subsequently, the heroes of the Living Jungle repealed the insects, saving the village. As a reward, the saru chieftain [[Mokka]] offered the heroes the honor of naming the saru village.",
