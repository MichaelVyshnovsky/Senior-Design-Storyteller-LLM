The Voice of a Lyre is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in July 1995 and is intended for adventurers of any level.
By happenstance, a group of adventurers of the Living City came across a young performer, Eric Luffson, at the Sleepy Dwarf Tavern. The young man performed The Ends of the Brotherhood of Mann, a song he wrote about his fathers curse – the result of a misadventure and betrayal decades prior. The adventurers agreed to find all past members of the Brotherhood of Mann to assemble the Seal of Mystra and confront the betrayal who had been trapped within a Shrine of Mystra. Subsequently, the adventurers tracked down Knile, Leland, Mehail, Quillion, and Seejil, slaying the betrayer and returning bard Luffs lyre and lifting the curse.
