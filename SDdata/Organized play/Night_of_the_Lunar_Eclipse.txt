As a moon eclipse loomed over the city of Ravens Bluff, Armen Moonsilver of the Temple of Selûne assembled a group of heroes to find and return the fabled obsidian amulet of the Dark Maiden – the prison of Jessar, the demi-goddess of the dark side of the moon and the void, enemy of Selûne. The adventurers had a limited amount of time to find and retrieve the item before the goddess could break out. To make things even more complicated, the amulet could not be touched by a male as Jessar immediately destroyed a mans form and consumed his soul, while a female who touched it was immediately possessed. The heroes had to have a woman armed with a special silver gauntlet, contain the goddess within the items, and immediately return it to the Temple of Selûne to be destroyed. With the heroes best efforts, the goddess either was freed, or her amulet swept away by the undercover followers of Jessar.
