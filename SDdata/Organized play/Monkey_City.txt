Monkey City is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for mid-level and high-level characters.
In the Year of Sorrow and Hope (1372 DR), Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle, were summoned by the chieftain of Huroola – Ambeela. The villages of Tuwanne and Valapana became targeted by a horde of hungry little thunder garuda who took a liking to Nubari meat. The adventurers found the jungle lizards but became overwhelmed and forced to retreat. In the process, they made a discovery – the Lost City of the Ancients, now in ruins. The group spent some time exploring the ruins and encountered a somewhat intelligent ancient shambling mound who showed signs of an ability to communicate in a broken and simplistic semblance of the Malatran common after listening to the adventurers speak it around the Shambler. Finally, the heroes faced the garuda swarm in the Ancients ruins and emerged vicious. As a reward, one of the male Nubari heroes was offered marriage to the Chieftain Ambeela as she sought a capable and strong partner.
