'''''Once Broken''''' is a tournament module in the [[Living Jungle]] organized play campaign for [[Dungeons & Dragons]] 2{{nd}} edition.

{{Quote|''The wilds of the Malatra plateau are home to many unique races and creatures. And from the numerous [[Nubari]] to the shy and reclusive [[tam'hi]], all know that the Once Broken [[Village of Big Chief Bagoomba]] is the place to gather to hear stories of heroic deeds and to find rumors that hint of grand adventures.''|}}

==Summary==
A group of young heroes of [[Malatra]] was asked to travel to a distant [[saru]] village that fell under a strange deathly blight. [[Bengoukee]] of the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]] discovered the strongest saru warrior outside the village, who delivered a map and a plea for help with this final drying moments. The adventurers traveled past the [[Fire Mountain]] and towards the [[Sleepy Lake]], past dangers of the jungles, [[quick-thunderer]] [[garuda]], and [[quicksand]], only to discover a dying village of saru wasting away. The blight was caused by a fickle [[earth spirit]] [[Ligela]] after a young saru fell on a patch of flowers sacred to the spirit. The village's [[shaman]] [[Magilla]] sent the heroes to collect rare ingredients to build an idol to appease the spirit. The search brought them into a conflict with rare species of bird known as [[reeos]]. They recovered strange green stones from the birds' nests needed for the idol's competition. Next, they searched for the [[giant bee]] [[wax]] and were ambushed by a gang of stranded [[shan sao]] brigands from the land of [[Kara-Tur]]. Eventually, the heroes returned to the saru village and finished [[Ligela]]'s totem which looked like a young Nubari child. Even though many saru died, survivors were grateful. Magilla led his village's survivors to join another saru community.
