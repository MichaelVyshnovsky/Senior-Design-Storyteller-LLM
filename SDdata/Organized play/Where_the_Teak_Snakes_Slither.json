It was published in 1994, and is intended for adventurers of all levels.\nDuring a dinner, a group of adventurers was tracked down at Embrol Sludges Eatery and Shell Shop by a messenger from the distant Waterdeep, who was tasked with delivering a single magic item – the inheritance from one of the adventurers uncle. However, the items sorcery was accidentally unleashed, and it spirited the table, the adventurers, the messenger, and an impatient waitress to the distant land of Zakharas Grey Jungle. The group embarked on a short adventure to discover the connection between their uncle and the Land of Fate, an encounter with a sea djinn, and a trick to a dangerous segarran at the heart of the jungle. Eventually, the heroes defeated the malevolent cultists of Ragarra and gained passage back to Ravens Bluff, either through many long months, if not years, of travel or with the djinns help. Marid was interested in exploring the \"Bluff of the Raves\" for himself and flew the group back to the Vast.\n •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \nItems\n • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\nArmor & Clothing\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  • \nGems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nVegetation\n •  • \nWeapons\n • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •  •"
