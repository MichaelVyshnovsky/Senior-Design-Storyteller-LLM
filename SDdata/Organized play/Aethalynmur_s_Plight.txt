'''''Aethalynmur's Plight''''' is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in 1999 and is intended for adventurers of all levels. It is a sequel to ''[[Aethalynmur's Wings]]'' and uses material from ''[[The Great Glacier (sourcebook)|The Great Glacier]]''.

==Summary==
A warm summer's day in [[Ravens Bluff]] sees the [[adventurer]]s stopping by the [[Downunder Patisserie]] for free cake and lemonade. But no sooner do they arrive than the [[sylph]] [[Rahmare]] appears and recruits them to search for the lost [[solar]], [[Aethalynmur]]. Her blind teleportation spell puts them in a cold day on the [[Great Glacier]], where they clash with a [[tirichik]], avoid an avalanche, and are aided by [[arctic dwarves]]. They arrive in the [[Iulutiun]] village of [[Yinntut]], where they receive information and supplies and participate in a traditional [[singdown]] contest. Afterward, their journey to [[Mount Akka]] takes them past a [[remorhaz]], [[penguin]]s, [[werebear]]s, and [[polar bear]]s. Finally, they reach the cave home of some [[frost giant]]s, who are keeping Aethalynmur prisoner on behalf of a [[demon]] called [[R'ek]]. By bribery or battle, they rescue Aethalynmur and return to Ravens Bluff.
