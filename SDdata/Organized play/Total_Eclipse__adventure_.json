It was published in 1998, and intended for adventurers of all levels, featuring separate adventure paths for groups of different power levels. The adventure is part 4 of When Darkness Falls.\nOn Kythorn 20 of 1371 DR, the city of Ravens Bluff was consumed by the annual summer solstice festival. The festival was also the day of the wedding of two prolific adventurers Jean-Dorial Encarthan and Kima Greyleaf-Encarthan. Several groups of adventures were in attendance when the blushing bride was kidnapped by a hag coven who worshiped the Lady of Loss, Shar Amilani, Harven, and Betsy. Luckily, Harvens disguise was recognized. The hag was purchasing buildings in Ravens Bluff, so the heroes had several locations to search. The hags planned on sacrificing the bride to Sha during the eclipse. The ritual required a devoted follower of Mystra to plunge the entire city into eternal night. Groups of adventurers split and set out to search for the coven and faced unrest in the city, as the Sharran cultists forced were beast transformation on the lycanthropes from the Church of Selûne, turning the citizens against them. The cultists summoned monsters to stop the heroes, but eventually, the crisis was over after the heroes confronted the hags and their fire giant servants and saved the bride just in time, as the eclipse came to an end.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •"
