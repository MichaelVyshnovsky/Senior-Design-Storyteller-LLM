Masks of the Dohi-ri is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for heroes of all levels.
Heroes of the Living Jungle participated in the annual Dohi-ri celebration – the Festival of the Mask, Zurich which they embarked on a journey to assemble and decorate masks from the boon of the jungle. The heroes traveled to marked destinations to collect jungle dyes and other ornamentations. They confronted a tribe of slaver tasloi, a band of leopard katanga pretending to be fellow Festival Walkers, visited an ancient shrine to an ancestor grippli race, parleyed with an evil nereid and a peaceful water naga. Eventually, one of the heroes was named the new Masked One, and their mask was enchanted.
