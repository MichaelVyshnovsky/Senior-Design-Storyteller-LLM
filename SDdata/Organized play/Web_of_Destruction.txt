{{Quote|''To honor the 25{{th}} year of [[Big Chief Bagoomba]]'s reign, a [[Great Race]] is held that only those heroes both fleet of foot and sharp of mind will win. But one group of heroes doesn't return. Into what sort of tangled web will you great heroes stumble?''|}}

==Summary==
In the Year of Great Change ([[1373 DR]]), the heroes of the [[Living Jungle]] were invited to celebrate the 25{{th}} year of Big Chief Bagoomba's rule. They were separated into five groups and sent to race through jungles in hopes of winning delectable treats and, later – reveling into the night. One of the competing bands never returned, and later, it was revealed they were slain by evil [[spider katanga]] who worshiped the ancient and powerfully malicious ''[[Statue of K'lel'al]]'' the corrupted the Living Jungle's [[leopard katanga]]. Great [[witch doctor]] [[Bengoukee]] revealed that the statue was hidden many years ago when he was a young adventurer himself. Now it was time to return to the statue to destroy it once and for all. Along the way, Bengoukee and the new generation of heroes discovered all adventuring companions of the revered witch doctor dead. Fighting through spider katanga worshiping [[K'lel'al]] and seeking its return to the jungle, the adventurers were successful in destroying the powerful artifact.
