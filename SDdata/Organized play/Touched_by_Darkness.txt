{{Quote|''The eyes of the young behold the world in ways different than those of adults, but a child claiming to be chased by creatures of the night can alarm even the most steadfast soul. But between the Church of Shar and the Night Knives, the people of Saerloon have reason to fear the night. And uncommon is the soul in Saerloon that has not been touched by darkness. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Sembia for characters levels 4&ndash;7.''}}
