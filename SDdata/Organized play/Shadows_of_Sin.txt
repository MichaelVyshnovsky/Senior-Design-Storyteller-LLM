{{Quote|''The [[Council of Elders (Malatra)|Council of Elders]] is in disarray, many of its members dead or wounded. Without the council to stop them, the [[Rudra]] now go to attack the [[lacerial]]s. Are the Rudrans just holding on to old grudges? Or is there merit to their claims that the lacerials are not the friends they claim to be?''}}

==Summary==
In the Year of Great Change ([[1373 DR]]), a war between the [[Rudra]] tribe and their old enemies – [[lacerial]], was threatening the united people of the Living Jungle. Lacerials were accused of stealing the sacred [[vanilla]] plants from the unclaimed lands between the two territories. The heroes of Malatra were dispatched to broker peace between the xenophobic Rudra and the garuda-people. The heroes were joined by Rudra [[shaman]] [[Com'lak]] and Chief [[M't'lak]] in investigating the supposed crime. The group reached the vanilla grove, where they met minor [[Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)|nature spirit]] defenders of the grove – [[Timon]] and [[Pumba]]. After inspecting the "stolen" plants, it became obvious that they were removed with utmost care and respect and that one could not steal that which belonged to no one.

The group ventured to the lacerial village of [[Lilac (village)|Lilac]] where Rudra witnessed the garuda-people fraternizing with disliked [[yuan-ti]], despite being technically allied with the Nubari tribes, and hated evil [[hyena katanga]]. After meeting with the lacerial elders – [[Starr]], [[Swiftwing]], and [[Trueblood]], the heroes discovered that the vanilla plants were an attempt to cast a fertility spell on the dying out garuda-folk. Trueblood revealed that they attempted to ally with hyena katanga to gain passage through the [[Rayana Savanna]] to a crashed ''[[spelljammer]]'' ship to try and repair its ''helm''. The ''spelljammer'' was the only chance the lacerials had to return to their homeworld. The heroes and [[M't'lak]] eagerly agreed to travel to the savanna in order to lend aid.

Joined by several lacerials, Trueblood, and their yuan-ti allies, the heroes encountered [[In-Twy-Da-May-La]], a warrior of [[lion katanga]] with whom M't'lak locked in battle. Possibly surviving the ordeal, M't'lak and heroes reached the downed [[oscray]] ''spelljammer'' only to be ambushed by [[hyena katanga]] and their allies – [[spinning spider katanga]] and an army of deadly [[kretch]], warrior creatures of the extra-planar evil of the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]]. With some casualties, the heroes survived the battle only to discover that the ''spelljammer helm'' was beyond repair.
