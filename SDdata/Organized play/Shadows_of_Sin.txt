Shadows of Sin is a tournament adventure module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 3 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network and part one in The Lacerial Trilogy. It is an adventure designed for 1- to 5-level characters with conversion available for levels 6- to 10.
In the Year of Great Change (1373 DR), a war between the Rudra tribe and their old enemies – lacerial, was threatening the united people of the Living Jungle. Lacerials were accused of stealing the sacred vanilla plants from the unclaimed lands between the two territories. The heroes of Malatra were dispatched to broker peace between the xenophobic Rudra and the garuda-people. The heroes were joined by Rudra shaman Comlak and Chief Mtlak in investigating the supposed crime. The group reached the vanilla grove, where they met minor nature spirit defenders of the grove – Timon and Pumba. After inspecting the "stolen" plants, it became obvious that they were removed with utmost care and respect and that one could not steal that which belonged to no one.
The group ventured to the lacerial village of Lilac where Rudra witnessed the garuda-people fraternizing with disliked yuan-ti, despite being technically allied with the Nubari tribes, and hated evil hyena katanga. After meeting with the lacerial elders – Starr, Swiftwing, and Trueblood, the heroes discovered that the vanilla plants were an attempt to cast a fertility spell on the dying out garuda-folk. Trueblood revealed that they attempted to ally with hyena katanga to gain passage through the Rayana Savanna to a crashed spelljammer ship to try and repair its helm. The spelljammer was the only chance the lacerials had to return to their homeworld. The heroes and Mtlak eagerly agreed to travel to the savanna in order to lend aid.
Joined by several lacerials, Trueblood, and their yuan-ti allies, the heroes encountered In-Twy-Da-May-La, a warrior of lion katanga with whom Mtlak locked in battle. Possibly surviving the ordeal, Mtlak and heroes reached the downed oscray spelljammer only to be ambushed by hyena katanga and their allies – spinning spider katanga and an army of deadly kretch, warrior creatures of the extra-planar evil of the Tamara. With some casualties, the heroes survived the battle only to discover that the spelljammer helm was beyond repair.
