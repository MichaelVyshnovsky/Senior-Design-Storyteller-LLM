The Killing Grounds is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program and the third installment of the High Level Underdark Campaign. It was published in October 1998 and is intended for adventurers of any level.
Soon after Field General Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV led a settling expedition to the Underdark and established the settlement of Ravens Deep in The Great Passage, a band of heroes was tasked with charting the nearby dangerous cavern known as The Passages of Man due their peculiar layout. The adventurers set into the dangerous terrain where they faced drow patrols, an ancient dwarven construct that held the spirit of Stonefist Gemsplitter, established contact with a drow merchant from Menzoberranzan â€“ Talabrina Xorlarrin, and found themselves in the middle of a small scale war between Zorinca of Juiblex and monstrous humanoids of the Underdark.
