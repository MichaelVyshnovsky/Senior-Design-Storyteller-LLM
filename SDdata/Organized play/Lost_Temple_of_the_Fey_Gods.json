        "mainbody": "Lost Temple of the Fey Gods, designed by Bill W. Baldwin, is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 4th-edition ruleset. It focuses on the Yuirwood, fey, and the Cult of Voldini.\nThe adventure starts off in the village of Halendos, where adventurers investigate accounts of problems with fey creatures in the area. Upon venturing into the nearby woods, the adventurers encounter a group of pixies, who playfully test the group to either entertaining them or their pet ogre.\nWhen midnight falls, the Temple of the Yuir Gods emerges and the adventurers must battle past its guardians to gain access to the inner sanctum. There they find a dying dryad, Nimiwi, and eventually confront the source of the fey troubles, the Cult of Voldini.\n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n • \n •  •  • \n •"
