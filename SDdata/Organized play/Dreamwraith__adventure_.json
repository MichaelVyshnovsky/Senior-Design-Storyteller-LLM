        "mainbody": "'''''Dreamwraith''''' is a one-round tournament adventure module designed by [[Richard L. Dold]] and set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in 1996, and intended for adventurers of all levels.\n\n{{Quote|''When the mists that connect Ravens Bluff to the Demiplane of Ravenloft rolled over the city for the last time, many lost adventures returned home from Ravenloft. Emeline Carpenter, a high level bard from Ravens Bluff, was one of those lost adventures who returned from Ravenloft. At the same time a dreamwraith came through the mists. It has since moved around the city looking for appropriate prey to feed upon.''}}",
        "Summary": "In [[1369 DR]], a group of adventurers returned to the Living City from the mysterious land of [[Ravenloft]] after being missing for five years. Soon, however, one of the Domains of Dread survivors fell victim to a creature called a [[dreamwraith]]. [[Emeline Carpenter]], a [[bard]] of Ravens Bluff, was trapped in the world of dreams, fighting for her life, while several of the other survivors of Ravenloft fell prey to the wraith. Desperate for help, Emeline prayed to her deity – [[Oghma]], who sent a vision and an animated [[dragon]] figurine to guide a group of adventurers to the bard. Subsequently, the adventurers realized that killing or removing the wraith from Emeline's body in the real world would kill her. They had to venture into the dreaming and slay the creature and its servants there.",
