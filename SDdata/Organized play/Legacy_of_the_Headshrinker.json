        "mainbody": "Legacy of the Headshrinker is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network and is the Part 2 of the Natures Crisis adventure that began in a Living City series adventure.\nIn the Year of Great Change (1373 DR), an old enemy resurfaced in the Living Jungle – the Headshrinkers and their undead. To battle the threat, witch doctor Bengoukee communed with spirits of nature. They tasked the witch doctor with assembling a band of young heroes to be sent to the taboo lands known as Faerûn. A band of heroes were granted the ability to use the tongues spell and sent through a magical path to a land far away. The strange new arrivals to Faerûn came across a group of bards traveling to the town of Lions Crossing, not far from Ravens Bluff. Subsequently, the heroes of the Living Jungle found the secret lair where their goal was hidden – an enchanted obsidian orb, guarded by a powerful fire elemental sentry. There, heroes faced a gang of zombies and their master – Headshrinker, but the orb was eventually recovered, and heroes returned to Bengoukee via magic.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nLocations\n •  •  • \n • \nOrganizations\n • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •"
