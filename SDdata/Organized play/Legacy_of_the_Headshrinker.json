The nature spirit has asked Bengoukee for heroes from his lands to assist nature in the correction of the problem.

        "Summary": "In the Year of Great Change ([[1373 DR]]), an old enemy resurfaced in the Living Jungle – the [[Headshrinker]]s and their [[undead]]. To battle the threat, [[witch doctor]] [[Bengoukee]] communed with spirits of nature. They tasked the witch doctor with assembling a band of young heroes to be sent to the taboo lands known as [[Faerûn]]. A band of heroes were granted the ability to use the ''[[tongues]]'' spell and sent through a magical path to a land far away. The strange new arrivals to Faerûn came across a group of [[bard]]s traveling to the town of [[Lion's Crossing]], not far from [[Ravens Bluff]]. Subsequently, the heroes of the Living Jungle found the secret lair where their goal was hidden – an [[enchanted]] [[obsidian]] orb, guarded by a powerful [[fire elemental]] sentry. There, heroes faced a gang of [[zombie]]s and their master – Headshrinker, but the orb was eventually recovered, and heroes returned to Bengoukee via magic.",
