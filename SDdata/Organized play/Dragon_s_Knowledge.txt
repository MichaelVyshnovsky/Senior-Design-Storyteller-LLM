Dragons Knowledge is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program, Part II of the Cycle of Dragons series. It was published in 2000, and intended for adventurers of all levels.
Following the draconic massacre above Hidden Hollow in the winter of the 1373 DR, heroes of the Living City continued investigating the looming danger of the Dark Lady and searing for the fabled Dragon Sage. The mages and sages of the Ministry of Art found a reference to the mystic figure in one of the prophecies of Alaundo the Mad – the Sage was in the Moonshae Isles. With wizardly aid, they were transported to the Isle of Gwynneth, where they faced the sinister child-abducting Crimson Order, led by a massive brown dragon prince named Torilsbane. The heroes of the Living City offered help in finding missing children of Corwell Town. Subsequently, their search led the heroes to Sunken Caves and the children, ensorcelled with magical charm. When the adventurers promised to return the kids back to their parents, one of them – a child that looked to be a sun elf, revealed himself to be the Nether, the Dragon Sage. Nether and adventurers faced Torilsbane in battle and ended his life, saving the children of Caer Corwell. The Dragon Sage gave them the next destination in uncovering the truth behind the Dark Lady – the City of Splendors.
