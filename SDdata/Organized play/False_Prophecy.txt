False Prophecy is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in July 1993 and is intended for adventurers of any level. The module received a reprint as the Adventure I of the Fall Season 1998 Adventurers Guild.
A group of adventurers of the Living City found themselves amidst a conflict between the Church of Waukeen, who constructed a Shrine to Waukeen in the citys Harbor District, and the devote worshipers of Selûne, who believed the harbor to be their churchs territory. The Selûnites concocted a scheme to defraud the shrines money and undermine its stability with the help of Lar & Sons Imports, who supplied the construction with crumbly bricks. Adventurers followed a trail of clues and a false Selûnite prophesy when the shrine collapsed. Subsequently, they uncovered the corruption and helped Lady Lauren DeVillars to apprehend the perpetrators.
