{{Quote|''Long ago in [[Malatra]]'s golden age, there were even more strange and wondrous sights than there are today. There were strange flying creatures and the fantastic inventions of the [[Nubari (ancient)|Ancients]]. Today only ruins of those cities remain, and of those ruins, most are undiscovered and/or warded. The few that have been found are known to hold strange things--things that the primitive people of Malatra do not comprehend...''}}

==Summary==
In the Year of Sorrow and Hope ([[1372 DR]]), a group of heroes ventured into the Living Jungle in search of a perfect birthday gift to Big Chief [[Bagoomba]]. Their adventure led them to a [[plantman (Malatra)|Malatran plantmen]] village afflicted by a strange [[the sickness (disease)|sickness]]. They agreed to investigate its source and try to find a cure for the village's [[shaman]] [[Staedt]]. The tracks of the infection led them to a landed massive boat from the sky, a ''[[spelljammer]]'' ship, piloted by [[L'riyt]] of [[Gobi Bank]], an [[arcane (race)|arcane]]. The wasting sicken was unwittingly brought on the ''spelljammer's'' hull, microorganisms that infected the water source in the area. With the aid of a translation device, the heroes of the Living Jungle found out that the visitor from the stars was not malevolent, and L'riyt agreed to help them. Together, they ventured into the ruined city of [[Donen]] of the [[Nubari (ancient)|Ancients]], where the arcane's goal was. They faced an ancient petrifying monster, a [[guardian boalisk]], but prospered. When the expedition was over, L'riyt produced the cure for the withering plantmen and departed [[Toril]]. The heroes missed the grand celebration of the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]] but saving the lives of Malatran plantmen was worth it.
