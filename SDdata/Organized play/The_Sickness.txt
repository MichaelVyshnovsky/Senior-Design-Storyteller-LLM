The Sickness is a tournament adventure module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. It is an adventure designed for any level characters.
In the Year of Sorrow and Hope (1372 DR), a group of heroes ventured into the Living Jungle in search of a perfect birthday gift to Big Chief Bagoomba. Their adventure led them to a Malatran plantmen village afflicted by a strange sickness. They agreed to investigate its source and try to find a cure for the villages shaman Staedt. The tracks of the infection led them to a landed massive boat from the sky, a spelljammer ship, piloted by Lriyt of Gobi Bank, an arcane. The wasting sicken was unwittingly brought on the spelljammers hull, microorganisms that infected the water source in the area. With the aid of a translation device, the heroes of the Living Jungle found out that the visitor from the stars was not malevolent, and Lriyt agreed to help them. Together, they ventured into the ruined city of Donen of the Ancients, where the arcanes goal was. They faced an ancient petrifying monster, a guardian boalisk, but prospered. When the expedition was over, Lriyt produced the cure for the withering plantmen and departed Toril. The heroes missed the grand celebration of the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba but saving the lives of Malatran plantmen was worth it.
