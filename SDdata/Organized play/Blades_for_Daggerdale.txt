Blades for Daggerdale, designed by Matthias Schäfer, is an adventure module set in the Forgotten Realms using the Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition ruleset. It focuses on Daggerdale, the gnolls, and the zhents.
The adventure starts off as adventurers stumble across a merchant caravan bound for Dagger Falls under attack by gnolls. After the ambush, the adventurers learn rumors of the Zhent Headless Horseman of Daggerdale and soon arrive in Dagger Falls. In the town, they learn that Zhent mercenaries are helping to fight off gnoll raids but a concerned Constable Morn asks for the adventurers support in a meeting with the mayor. At the meeting, attempts are made to convince the mayor not to hire the Zhents and the adventurers are sent to seek out a gnoll hideout.
Along the way, they encounter a drowning dwarf who points them in the right direction to find the gnolls. Upon finding the gnoll cave, the adventurers locate proof of the Zhents involvement in the gnoll attacks. However, as they leave, a group of Zhents confront the adventurers but the sudden appearance of Swift Elyan disguised as the Zhent Headless Horseman scares most of them away. Finally, back in Dagger Falls, the adventurers are able to finish their meeting with the mayor with evidence of the Zhent plot.
