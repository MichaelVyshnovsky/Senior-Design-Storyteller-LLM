{{Quote|''They say that the speed of the jungle grapevine outpaces the wind in the sky or the speed of the river. Never has it been truer than now. [[Bengoukee]] has been wounded by servants of the [[Tamara (Malatra)|tiger]], and is not expected to live. Bengoukee is dying!''|}}

==Summary==
In the Year of Great Change ([[1373 DR]]), the revered [[witch doctor]] [[Bengoukee]] fell victim to a savage [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]] attack. He was dying, and the healers, witch doctors, and sages from across Malatran united tribes arrived at the [[Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba]] to find a cure. They selected a group of accomplished adventurers of the Living Jungle and sent them to collect the unique healing flower and a spirit named [[Amaranthus]] who resided on the far away [[Lake Kovo]]. The heroes traveled along the [[River of Laughing Idols]] and eventually came across a dead child of a fabled [[great white saru]], or [[Creci]]. The group helped the great white ape avenge his child against the treacherous [[kretch]]. The [[Creci]]'s name was [[Haniyya]], and he guided the adventurers to Amaranthus. The spirit spirited the heroes into the [[Dreamlands]] and tested their resolve with a set of trials. As they were successful, Amaranthus, now a flower, returned with them to the dying witch doctor. The heroes of the Living Jungle faced a faithful choice: use Amaranthus to save Bengoukee's life and break the prophecy, leaving the Lion Spirit [[Vizurathu]] vulnerable against the evil Tamara, or let Bengoukee die and save Amaranthus for the Lion's Return.
