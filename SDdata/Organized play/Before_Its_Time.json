It was published in 1999, and is intended for adventurers of all levels.\nAfter attending a grand opening party at the Tavern of the Garden in Ravens Bluff, a group of heroes of the Living City was approached by a young woman – the proprietor. Shauna Morden revealed to the group that she recently discovered a winery that her late father owned, and she needed hirelings to visit the property, find out about its state, and connect with the winerys keepers, if any. The group traveled up the Fire River aboard The Topside to the town of Dragon Falls, the nearest settlement to the winery. After interviewing locals and the renowned druid Keldar of the Forest, the heroes met the winerys new owner, a secret maedar – Vorlon, who took over the winery, alongside his wife- medusa Samanthiss. The duo found the winery almost a decade before that, taking it from a young Chauntean. After some investigation, the group discovered the true nature of the new owners and how they claimed the winery however, the media and her husband lacked malice and truly loved winemaking. Subsequently, the heroes resolved the ownership via one of several possible ways they likely connected Vorlon and Shauna Morden, making for a fruitful business. Another possibility was that heroes ended the serpentine winemaker and returned the winery to Larn, the young Chauntean who spent a decade petrified.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\n • \nArmor & Clothing\n •  • \nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nMusical Instruments\n •  • \nShips & Vehicles\n •  • \nWeapons\n •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •"
