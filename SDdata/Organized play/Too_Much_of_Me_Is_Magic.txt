Too Much of Me Is Magic is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 2001, and is intended for adventurers of 5&ndash13 levels.
During one summer evening, a group of heroes of the Living City was asked to embark on a political mission by the solar Aethylnmur of the Arrus demiplane. The group was tasked with escorting a new ambassador to the demiplane of Chertt however, there was one catch, no powerful magical creatures could pass through the planar gate and no hero of the living City could pass with more than ten magic items without suffering harm. The passage back was only possible for the heroes carrying up to ten magic items. The group traversed the planes and escorted ambassador Diaphany to the Regent of Stone – the planes ruler, and along the way, got involved with the so-called Big Boss – the corrupted ancient earth elemental named Bohuss, who sought to end the peace treaty between Chertt and Arrus.
