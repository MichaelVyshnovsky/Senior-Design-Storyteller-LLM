Quest for the Snake Mother is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. It was intended for a group of 1&ndash6 level characters.
In the Year of Gathering Darkness, Bengoukee, the great witch doctor, sent the heroes of the Living Jungle to forge a truce between the Nubari tribes of Malatra and the dreaded Snake Mother of the yuan-ti. Bengoukee had a vision of the looming threat to the jungle and the spirits communicated to him that the threat would be revealed by the Snake Mother. The adventurers reached the Snake Country, bordering the Kuomi village and swiftly became captured by the Snake People. However, the Snake Mother received visions of the adventurers and she spared them from becoming a yuan-ti feast. To the dismay of there worshipers, the great Snake Mother agreed to the truce in exchange for recovering the ancient artifact – the Stone of Seeing that held the answers Bengoukee sought. Subsequently, the truce was reached, yuan-ti received rulership of the jungles beyond Kuomi and the heroes were granted a vision of the looming threat – the Tiger, another name for the extra-dimensional evil of the Tamara.
