An Army of One Thousand is an adventure module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 3 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. It is an adventure designed for 1- to 5-level characters with conversion available for levels 6- to 10.
The events of the adventure took place in the Year of Tigers Curse (1374 DR). The spider katanga became a threat once again, amassing and filling the rivers flowing from Fire Mountain with poison. Two groups of heroes were sent to stop the evil spider creatures - one group to cause a distraction and rescue the recently captured scouting party, and another to venture into the spider katanga lair to kill the Mother of a Thousand Young before she can birth an army.
