It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network.\nThe adventure takes place after the events of The Sickness, in the Year of Despair (1375 DR), Malatran calendar. The spirits guided the heroes of the Ling Jungle toward the saurial village of Lilac, where Starr the Shaman and Trueblood the Witch-Doctor shared a vision with them of a ball of fire plummeting from the skies. The meteorite fell onto the Malatran Plateau, leaving fiery death and destruction within its crater. The jungle spirits contained the destruction and extinguished the fires. When they saw a local tree transformed through the meteors magic into Spirit Tree, they communed with laterals, prophesizing the tree to be used in the looming battle with the Tamara. The adventurers were tasked with digging the tree out and transporting it to Lilac. Subsequently, the Spirit Tree was delivered to the saurial witch doctor, and the group only needed to decide what kind of weapon they would craft using the wondrous tree.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nLocations\n •  •  •  •  • \nOrganizations\nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •"
