        "mainbody": "&ndash5 (LC)3&ndash5 (Polyhedron)\nEye of the Leviathan is a Living City adventure for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition, intended for 4-8 characters of levels 3-5, designed by Randall Lemon and Ed Peterson. It was originally printed for Winter Fantasy convention in January 1992 and widely published in Polyhedron 87, July 1993.\nLord Charles Frederick Blacktree IV sent a group of adventurers to recover an alleged heirloom recently stolen from him. The item in question was a powerful artifact – the Eye of the Leviathan, that itself was stolen from its rightful owners – tritons of the Sea of Fallen Stars. The hirelings tracked the criminals to Crackens Berth and Board and Embrol Sludges Eatery & Shell Shoppe and eventually, followed the pirate named Jud Jimson into the sea. There, the adventures joined a pirate attack on Lord Jonas Weatherbys vessel while a band of weresharks got away with the artifact. The last part of the adventure took the heroes to the bollox of the Sea of Fallen Stars, where they dealt with friendly sea elves, met a singing walrus, and tracked the Eye of the Leviathan to the aboleth who sent its thralls to capture the artifact. After it was recovered, the heroes faced a dilemma, return it to the tritons or slaughter the tritons and bring it back to Ravens Bluff.\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull \nSpells\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nItems\nPotions\n &bull  &bull \nOthers\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \n &bull \n &bull  &bull  &bull \nClothing & Armor\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nMaterials\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nShips\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nWeapons\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull \nOther\n &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull  &bull"
