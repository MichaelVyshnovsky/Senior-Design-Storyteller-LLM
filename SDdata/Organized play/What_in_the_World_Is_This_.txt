What in the World Is This? is an adventure in the Living City organized play campaign, originally designed for Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition but later updated for 3 edition. It is the first adventure in the The Menagerie of a Raven Lunatic series.
After its initial run as a tournament adventure, What in the World Is This? was reprinted twice, first as part of the Adventurers Guild program in 1998 (along with the rest of the The Menagerie of a Raven Lunatic series). A version of the adventure updated for 3 edition was released in 2002 by Organized Play that expanded upon various elements of the story and added stronger ties to the Living City setting.
