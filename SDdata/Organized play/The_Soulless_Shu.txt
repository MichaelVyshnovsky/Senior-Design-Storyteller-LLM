A group visiting heroes of the Living Jungle partook in the shu festival of the Sumbuki tribe. The festival was the competition for the title of the tribes new Shunin – the chieftain. Booda was the winner, and the crown passed from Wutuka to the new leader. During the crowning ceremony the next day, a deadly monsoon struck the shutdown village, resulting in the death of Wutuka and Boodas injury.
