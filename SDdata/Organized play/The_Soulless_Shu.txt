the air, what could possibly go wrong?''|}}

==Summary==
The events of the adventure take place directly after ''[[If the Shu Fits]]'', in the late summer of The Year of Gathering Darkness. A group visiting heroes of the Living Jungle partook in the [[shu]] festival of the [[Sumbuki]] tribe. The festival was the competition for the title of the tribe's new Shunin – the chieftain. [[Booda]] was the winner, and the crown passed from [[Wutuka]] to the new leader. During the crowning ceremony the next day, a deadly monsoon struck the shutdown village, resulting in the death of Wutuka and Booda's injury. The visiting heroes set out to investigate the occurrence, leading them to a confrontation with [[Fazook]] the [[Rakshasa]] and its [[leopard katanga]] minions. After the magically-summoned storm, Fazook stole the late chieftains body to ritualistically consume his heart and enslave his soul. Subsequently, the fiendish villain was stopped. Soon after, two of the tribe's young heroes – [[Tweek]] and [[Cenari]] became wed, thinking the rakshasa's defeat to be a blessing from the spirits of the jungle. During the ceremony, the earth rumbled. The she with doctors took it as a good sign of earth spirits' happiness, however, it was a warning of the terrible calamity for the Malatran Plateau that laid ahead.
