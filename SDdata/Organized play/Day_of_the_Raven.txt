'''''Day of the Raven''''' is a one round adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in August 1991 as the sixth Living City tournament module and is intended for adventurers of any level.

{{quote|''The PCs' main goal is to recover several stolen magic items that were taken from the temple of Waukeen. The first encounter will take place four days before the summer solstice.''}}

==Synopsis==
After the [[Temple of Waukeen (Ravens Bluff)|Temple of Waukeen]], under the supervision of [[Norval DeVillars]] was robbed of its treasures by the [[Four Ravens Thieves Guild]], the perpetrators, [[Sara Porter|Sara]] and [[Thomas Porter]] were captured and executed. With their deaths, Ravens Bluff believed the Four Ravens was gone and the guild's base was turned into the [[White Springs]] muses. Some times later, [[Lauren DeVillars]] of Waukeen assembled a band of adventurers of the Living City to track down the lost temple treasures. The group's investigation led them to uncovering a secret map to the thieves' vault, where the treasures were hidden.
