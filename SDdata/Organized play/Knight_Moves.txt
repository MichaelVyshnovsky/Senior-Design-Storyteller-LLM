'''''Knight Moves''''' is a special event adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program, created for knight and squire player characters only. It was published in 1997 for the 2{{nd}} edition, and intended for adventurers of all levels.

{{Quote|''The Consortium of the Bloody Fang is an evil organization with a long history and a very specific agenda. Thus far they have tried to execute their plans in secret and have had considerable success in keeping their activities unknown. The Bloody Fang’s presence in Ravens Bluff, while strong, is minimal.Most of their missions have been conducted in other cities in the Vast. Now that the war has ended, they have become concerned with the number of knights that Ravens Bluff has within its military ranks. Having so many knights without a war to fight is bound to be bad for the Bloody Fang.''}}

==Summary==
A grand reception for knights and paladins of Ravens Bluff took place in the [[Griffon Hall]] on the 7{{th}} of [[Flamerule 7|Flamerule]]. Unbeknown to all, [[wizard]] [[Carston Willows]] was ''[[charm]]ed'' into serving as an informant for a [[fiendish]] organization that threatened the Living City – the [[Consortium of the Bloody Fang]]. Using that intel, the powerful fiend named [[Charbane]] assassinated two ranking knights – [[Ian Graham]] and [[Carolyn Skyhawk]]. Using that as a way to lure a group of the strongest paladins and knights from the gala and challenge them to a duel. The challenge took place in Charbane's lair and aided by a devilish trap devised from Carston Willows's favorite game – [[Chess (game)|chess]].
