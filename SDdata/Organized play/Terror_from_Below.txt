Terror from Below is a tournament module set in Malatra – Living Jungle using the Dungeons & Dragons 2 edition ruleset. It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for low-level and mid-level characters.
In the Year of Gathering Darkness, late 14 century DR, a group of heroes joined a grand celebration of a tontor named Amanakis birthday, hosted by the tribe of The Wise Ones. During the celebrations, the tribes chieftain Arkari approached them with a request to investigate the taboo holy site – the tontor graveyard. The adventure brought the heroes of the Living Jungle to a maelephant, impressed underneath the tontor graveyard over a thousand years prior.
