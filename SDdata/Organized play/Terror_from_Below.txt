==Summary==
In the Year of Gathering Darkness, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes joined a grand celebration of a [[tontor]] named [[Amanaki]]'s birthday, hosted by the tribe of [[The Wise Ones]]. During the celebrations, the tribe's chieftain [[Arkari]] approached them with a request to investigate the taboo holy site – the tontor graveyard. The adventure brought the heroes of the Living Jungle to a [[maelephant]], impressed underneath the tontor graveyard over a thousand years prior.
