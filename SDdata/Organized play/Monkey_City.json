        "mainbody": "'''''Monkey City''''' is a tournament module set in ''Malatra – Living Jungle'' using the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 2{{rd}} edition ruleset. It is part of the ''[[Living Jungle]]'' series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for mid-level and high-level characters.\n\n{{Quote|''The characters are summoned to a [[Huroola]] village by its elders, who are having a serious problem. A pack of [[garuda]] has been systematically hunting the tribal members and the best warriors of the tribe have fallen. The leader of the tribe, [[Ambeela]], is so desperate that she has asked help of the heroes of [[Malatra]], female or male. She has put aside her personal taboo on males carrying and using weapons in this case, provided that the male weapon-wielders are not Huroola males.''|}}",
        "Summary": "In the Year of Sorrow and Hope ([[1372 DR]]), Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle, were summoned by the chieftain of [[Huroola]] – [[Ambeela]]. The villages of [[Tuwanne]] and [[Valapana]] became targeted by a horde of hungry [[little thunder]] [[garuda]] who took a liking to [[Nubari]] meat. The adventurers found the jungle lizards but became overwhelmed and forced to retreat. In the process, they made a discovery – the [[Lost City of the Ancients]], now in ruins. The group spent some time exploring the ruins and encountered a somewhat intelligent ancient [[shambling mound]] who showed signs of an ability to communicate in a broken and simplistic semblance of the [[Malatran common]] after listening to the adventurers speak it around the Shambler. Finally, the heroes faced the garuda swarm in the Ancient's ruins and emerged vicious. As a reward, one of the male Nubari heroes was offered marriage to the Chieftain Ambeela as she sought a capable and strong partner.",
