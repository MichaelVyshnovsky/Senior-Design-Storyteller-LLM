        "mainbody": "No firm date is present in any of the versions of Caravan. At Last, Ravens Bluff, which is set immediately after Caravan, makes it clear the adventure is set in the spring. The ages of certain NPCs in Counterfeit Dreams, which is set a few weeks later, agree with sourcebooks such as Gateway to Ravens Bluff, the Living City (which is set in 1355 DR) and Inside Ravens Bluff, the Living City (which can also be surmised to be set in 1355 DR). For more information, see here.\nCaravan is the first tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It debuted at Gen Con 20, which ran from August 20&ndash23, 1987, and was later published in Polyhedron #66, then later published once more as part of the Adventurers Guild organized play program in 1998. Its story is continued in At Last, Ravens Bluff.\nIndex based on the Polyhedron #66 edition.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \n •  • \n • \n •  •  •"
