Bengoukee of the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba discovered the strongest saru warrior outside the village, who delivered a map and a plea for help with this final drying moments. The adventurers traveled past the Fire Mountain and towards the Sleepy Lake, past dangers of the jungles, quick-thunderer garuda, and quicksand, only to discover a dying village of saru wasting away. The blight was caused by a fickle earth spirit Ligela after a young saru fell on a patch of flowers sacred to the spirit. The villages shaman Magilla sent the heroes to collect rare ingredients to build an idol to appease the spirit. The search brought them into a conflict with rare species of bird known as reeos. They recovered strange green stones from the birds nests needed for the idols competition. Next, they searched for the giant bee wax and were ambushed by a gang of stranded shan sao brigands from the land of Kara-Tur. Eventually, the heroes returned to the saru village and finished Ligelas totem which looked like a young Nubari child. Even though many saru died, survivors were grateful. Magilla led his villages survivors to join another saru community.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nLocations\n •  •  •  • \nOrganizations\nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  • \nMiscellaneous\nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterial\n •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •  •"
