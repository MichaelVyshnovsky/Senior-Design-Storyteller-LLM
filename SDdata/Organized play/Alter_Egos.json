        "mainbody": "'''''Alter Egos''''' is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in 1998, and intended for adventurers of all levels.\n\n{{Quote|''Four former members of the enemy army have infiltrated the city. Still bitter from their defeat, they have decided to gain the riches originally promised them by simply taking it from the citizens of Ravens Bluff. At the same time they can get revenge by discrediting those most responsible for their loss, the city's adventurers.''}}",
        "Summary": "The [[Merchant District]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] became a hotbed of thievery and illegal protection racket in [[1371 DR]]. Surprisingly, several well-known heroes of the Living City were the culprits. One group of heroes that were fingered for the crimes was away on a diplomatic mission to [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]]. The [[Merchant Watch]]'s believed that the heroes magically transported themselves to and from the Living City to use their mission to Kurth as an alibi. However, Judge [[Elias \"Deathstroke\" Mulgany]] knew better and intercepted the heroes as they returned to Ravens Bluff. He tasked them with investigation and clearing their name but warned them that the Merchant Watch would not be as kind if the adventurers were to be arrested. The group interrogated store owners who claimed that they were the racketeers. [[Bouquet Boutique]], [[Ephram's Antiquities]], [[Madame LaTachia's]], [[Malishar's Magicks]], [[The Baker Boys]], and [[Wycke's]] were the names of the shops. Eventually, the adventurers followed the evidence to a group of scoundrels who were part of [[Myrkyssa Jelan]]'s army during the war. They used a ''[[wand of alter self]]'' to extort, steal, and collect payments from across the district. After a confrontation, it was believed that the criminals were apprehended by the same adventurers they impersonated. However, some accords claimed that the criminals escaped justice in a commotion of a collapsing ruined temple of [[Cyric]].",
