It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. The adventure is intended for mid-level and high-level characters.\nIn the Year of Great Change (1373 DR), the revered witch doctor Bengoukee fell victim to a savage Tamara attack. He was dying, and the healers, witch doctors, and sages from across Malatran united tribes arrived at the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba to find a cure. They selected a group of accomplished adventurers of the Living Jungle and sent them to collect the unique healing flower and a spirit named Amaranthus who resided on the far away Lake Kovo. The heroes traveled along the River of Laughing Idols and eventually came across a dead child of a fabled great white saru, or Creci. The group helped the great white ape avenge his child against the treacherous kretch. The Crecis name was Haniyya, and he guided the adventurers to Amaranthus. The spirit spirited the heroes into the Dreamlands and tested their resolve with a set of trials. As they were successful, Amaranthus, now a flower, returned with them to the dying witch doctor. The heroes of the Living Jungle faced a faithful choice use Amaranthus to save Bengoukees life and break the prophecy, leaving the Lion Spirit Vizurathu vulnerable against the evil Tamara, or let Bengoukee die and save Amaranthus for the Lions Return.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \nLocations\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nOrganizations\n •  •  •  •  • \nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  • \nItems\nOther\n •  • \n •"
