        "mainbody": "Fools Luck is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1998, and is intended for adventurers of all levels.\nIn preparation for Victoria Vangos wedding, her twin brother, Victor Vango, hired an entertainer and organized a shipment of wines to arrive at Ravens Bluff. The entertainer was Hobart Hoppalong, a mortal who recently became a quasi-power. Along the way, the wine shipment, along with Hobart, was willingly taken by Donavil Grapevine, who became curious about Donavils powerful magical staff. To return back to Ravens Bluff, Hobart Hoppalong took on the magical guise of Victor Vango. He hired a group of adventurers of the Living City to venture into an abandoned Temple of Stillsong and retrieve the shipment, and in the process, allow the quasi-deity to absorb the magic of Donavils staff.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nMaterials\n •  •  • \nVegetation\n •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •  • \n •"
