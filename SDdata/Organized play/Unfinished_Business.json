        "mainbody": "Unfinished Business is a one round adventure module set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in May 1996 and was Part I of the Unfinished Business storyline. The module is intended for adventurers of any level.\nAs the High Murderer, once noble Anton DMagus, now known as the Dark Lord, was brought to justice, a group of adventurers of the Living City failed to stop the enemy of Ravens Bluff. Soon after, the heroes are confronted by the mysterious chronomancer named Terra Moortain from the Dimension of Time. She showed the adventurers visions of the future that they unleashed – the Dark Lord Anton DMagus would eventually come to claim Zhentil Keep as his own and lay waste to the Dalelands first, then to the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr, and eventually destroying the city of Ravens Bluff. To protect the Realms and fix the timeline, Terra sent the adventurers back in time to the very beginning of the adventure that led to Lord DMaguss escape. The heroes retained no memory of the meeting with the chronomancer but would experience strong feelings of deja vu as they retreaded their steps. Unbeknownst to all, Anton DMagus received a similar warning from another chronometer, and the future was already being changed. The adventurers of the Living City traveled to the Magus Keep to face the Dark Lord and bring him to justice. The confrontation went differently this way, and after a series of traps and an ambush, Anton was slain, the dark future of all Faerûn was undone.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  • \n • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nArmor & Clothing\n •  •  • \nFood & Drink\nMaterials\n •  • \nWeapons\n •  •  •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  • \n •"
