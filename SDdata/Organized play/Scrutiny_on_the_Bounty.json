It was published in May 1998 and is intended for adventurers of any level.\nOn 28 of Flamerule, the , Mayor Amber Lynn Thoden ordered a group of adventurers of Ravens Bluff to act as escort for the High Autharch Blaze Mythalanir, accompanying him and a legendary ship – Bounty, across the Sea of Fallen Stars to Bezantur. It was imperative adventurers did not interfere with the Thayan officials nor his slaves to avoid political repercussions. The adventurers sailed off, but unbeknownst to everyone onboard, the legendary ship held a pocket dimension that became home to a coven of bheur hags while the ship was lost at sea. The hags began killing the ships crew one at a time, causing fear and mistrust. Subsequently, the hags attacked Blaze Mythalanir himself, forcing him to teleport, abandoning the Bounty. Eventually, the hags were slain, and the heroes of the Living City were left with the ship and its slave crew. The Bounty was returned to its rightful owner – the nation of Aglarond. The slaves were granted freedom.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n • \n •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther\n • \nClothing & Armor\nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  • \n • \nMaterials\n •  • \nWeapons\n • \nOther\n •  •"
