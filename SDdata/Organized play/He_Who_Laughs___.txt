He Who Laughs... is a one-round tournament adventure module designed by Gail Reese and set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1996, and intended for adventurers of all levels.
In late fall-early winter of 1369 DR, the Jack Mooney and Sons Circus, in Procampur for the winter, was targeted by a monstrous elf vampire Aaron the Red. The bloodsucker took on a guise of a ranking Zhentarim and with fooled members of the Black Network, he set out to kill and transform most all employees of the circus, including Jack Mooney and his family, into undead and vampires. The allied cities of Procampur and Ravens Bluff enrolled a group of heroes to stop the undead invasion, as bth city were short on resources due to the war in the Vast. Temples of both cities volunteered their services to resurrect anyone who was not destroyed in the process. Subsequently, the threat was ended and Aaron the Red was scared off, slain, or arrested by the heroes.
