'''''Aethalynmur's Wings''''' is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the [[Living City]] organized play program. It was published in 1997 and is intended for adventurers of all levels. The later module ''[[Aethalynmur's Plight]]'' is a sequel to this one.

==Summary==
It's a slow day in [[Ravens Bluff]], with no more than some [[kobold]] bandits to round up outside the city gate and the [[adventurer]]s stopping by the [[Downunder Patisserie]] for snacks. But once there, the [[solar]] [[Aethalynmur]] appears and recruits them to save [[Nimbus City]] in a [[demi-plane]] of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], from being terrorized by two rogue [[cleric]]s and twin brothers from [[Oerth]], [[Alsgo]] and [[Pardo]]; who seek components for a powerful spell with which to conquer Greyhawk. After arriving in Nimbus, the heroes explore the planar city, battle [[mephit]]s and [[manticore]]s, as well as [[chaggrin]], meet a cloud-sculpting [[sylph]] and rescue a [[ki-rin]], and more. Once done, they return via a third city, [[Harmony (city)|Harmony]], and are transported back to Ravens Bluff.
