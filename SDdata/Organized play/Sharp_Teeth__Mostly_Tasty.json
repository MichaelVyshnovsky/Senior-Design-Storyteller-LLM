It is part of the Living Jungle series of adventures published for the RPGA Network. It is an adventure designed for characters of 1-3 levels with conversions available for 3-5 levels.\nThe adventure took place in the Year of New Peoples of the Malatran Calendar (1370 DR). After the Ootoongee Hairpin Festival of the Koshiva tribe, the chieftains wife lost her vision. Chieftain Katar sent a group of heroes of the Living Jungle to find a dangerous tribe – the cannibalistic Kukalatu of the Hebika River. After a trick through the jungles, the heroes met now reformed Kukalatu hunters who showed no ill will and had a streak of dark humor. The leader of the tribe was the Eldest One who offered the heroes a healing concoction, however, to prepare the medicine, she needed waters and unique blind cave fish of Nu-le Mi-se from within the Moaning Cave. The adventurers braved the dangerous caves and returned with a  gourd filled with fish and cave water. The Eldest One prepared the promised medicine, cooked a feast of the blind cave fish for her tribe, and happily opened trade relations with previously hostile Malatran tribes.\nCharacters\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nCreatures\n •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \nLocations\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOrganizations\n •  • \n •  •  • \nMagic\nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  • \nMiscellaneous\nFood & Drink\n •  •  •  •  •  • \nLanguages\n • \nEvents\n •  •  • \nOther\n •  •  •  •  •"
