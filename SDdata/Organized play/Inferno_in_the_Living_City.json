As that module has been estimated to be set in 1355 DR, that would place the events of Inferno in 1359 DR.\nInferno in the Living City is a one-round tournament adventure module set in the Living City organized play program and is the third installment of The Gathering Darkness series of modules. It was published in 1995, and intended for adventurers of all levels."
