        "mainbody": "aps! is a one-round tournament adventure module designed by Eugene Luster and set in the Living City organized play program. It was published in 1998, and intended for adventurers of all levels.\nIn 1371 DR, a group of heroes from the Living City enjoyed a meal at the newly opened Dancing Bear Inn when a group of wandering zombies attacked commoners in the streets. Volunteering to investigate the strange occurrence, the adventurers tracked the undead to Forrest Funeral Home. Its proprietor, Jonathan Forrest, succumbed to madness and, with the unwilling help of a jeweler mage, Felicia Cartier, and eager aid from the Talassan Stormlord named Electra Storm, he began accumulating an army of several hundred zombies and skeletons, stored around the funeral home. Subsequently, the Living City heroes ended the undead infestation by reasoning with the madman, slaying him, or arresting him on behalf of the City Watch of the Bluff.\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  • \n •  •  •  •  • \n •  • \n •  •  •  • \nSpells\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nItems\n •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n • \nFood & Drink\n •  • \nMaterials\n •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \nOther"
