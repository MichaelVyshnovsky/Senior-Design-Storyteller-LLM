        "mainbody": "Bloodfreeze arrow was a transmutation spell that transformed a projectiles tip into ice.\nAs mentioned above, bloodfreeze arrow was cast on a projectile like an arrow or a bolt. It could be cast on those of masterful quality. On successful casting, the tip of the arrow or bolt changed into blue ice. When the projectile was shot and hit somebody, the target did not just suffer from the cold, but could become paralyzed from the magic of the enchanted projectile.\nBloodfreeze arrow required verbal and material components. The latter was the arrow or bolt of masterful quality that was to be enchanted."
