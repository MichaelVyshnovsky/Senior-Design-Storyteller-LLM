        "mainbody": "Faithful mount was a charm spell, within the greater enchantment school of magic, that allowed a cleric to enjoy a strong and permanent bond with a mount of their choosing.\nUpon casting this spell, a specific mount was placed under the effects of the spells charm mammal and speak with animals. They became exceptionally loyal to the spells caster and could converse with and understand them as if they spoke the same language. While the effects of the spell were permanent, it was possible that the targeted animal could resist its effects, whereby it was permanently immune to any further castings by the same cleric or priest.\nThis spell affected a number of animals that could be ridden as mounts including mules, donkeys, ponies, horses, rhinoceroses, elephants, hippogriffs, griffons, pegasi, and even unicorns.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small lump of sugar in order to be cast."
