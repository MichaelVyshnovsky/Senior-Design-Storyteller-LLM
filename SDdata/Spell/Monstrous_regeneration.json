        "mainbody": "Monstrous regeneration was a conjuration spell used by clerics.\nThis spell allowed the caster to confer a regenerative ability to a touched creature. Though the spell duration was typically not long enough to usually allow the creature to regrow a severed limb, a severed limb could be held against the wound and reattach itself.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
