Portal stabilization was a transmutation spell that stabilized a magical portal.
Portals, those older than a century in particular, were susceptible to malfunction due to exposure to global magical catastrophes and simple wear. The portal stabilization spell made the usage of such malfunctioning portals safer to a degree. The level at which it stabilized was such that it could merely not work at all or send a person to the wrong place, but not necessarily hurt the user.
Portal stabilization required somatic and verbal components as well as a divine focus.
