        "mainbody": "Mass darkvision was a transmutation spell that allowed several people to gain access to darkvision.\nMass darkvision conferred benefits similar to the darkvision spell. The difference lay in scale. Mass darkvision allowed the caster to allow a number of creatures, which grew with the casters skill, within  to gain the benefits. There was a second version of this spell that gave any number of creatures the benefits, but only when they were within .\nThe  variant worked like the darkvision The 10-feet-version required different material components in the form of an entire dried carrot or three agates."
