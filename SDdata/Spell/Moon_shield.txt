Moon shield was a multi-school divine spell that conjured a incorporeal shield of shimmering lunar energy.
When this spell was cast, the moon shield materialized near the caster and floated beside them. It appeared to be made of pure moonlight and provided illumination as such.
The moon shield partially protected the caster from death magic, spells that fell under the sun sphere, and effects that emanated from the undead.
This spell was contained within the rings that composed the Moonweb.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material components of a small piece of silver and a moonstone of nearly any size.
