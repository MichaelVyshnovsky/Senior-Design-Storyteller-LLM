        "mainbody": "Istishias tsunami was a spell used by clerics of Istishia.\nWhen cast, this spell created a massive wall of water that raced towards a target at rapid speeds. The size and power of the wave was determined by the amount of water pressure, and the casters skill level. Its destructive effect on structures was similar to that of the earthquake spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of the caster and a small stone. The stone was thrown into the water during casting."
