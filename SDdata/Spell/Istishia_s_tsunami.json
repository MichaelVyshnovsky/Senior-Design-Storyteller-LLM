        "mainbody": "'''''Istishia's tsunami''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Istishia]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a massive wall of water that raced towards a target at rapid speeds. The size and power of the wave was determined by the amount of water pressure, and the caster's skill level. It's destructive effect on structures was similar to that of the ''[[earthquake]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of the caster and a small stone. The stone was thrown into the water during casting."
