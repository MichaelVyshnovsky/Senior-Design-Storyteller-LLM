'''''Danse macabre''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[warlock]]s and [[wizard]]s to raise the dead. 

==Effects==
When cast, up to five corpses within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} were reanimated as [[undead]]. The caster was able to command the creatures. If no command was given, the undead only defended themselves if attacked. The undead followed the caster's command until it was fulfilled. When the spell expired, the spell was lifted and the undead collapsed, becoming corpses once more. 

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
