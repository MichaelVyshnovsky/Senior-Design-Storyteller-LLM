        "mainbody": "'''''Eldritch rain''''' is an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] used most often by [[Warlock#Fey Pact Warlock|fey pact]] [[warlock]]s, though other warlocks sometimes learn to use it. Similar in some ways to the more basic ''[[eldritch blast]]'', ''eldritch rain'' creates a series of deadly purple rays of [[arcane magic|arcane]] power, hurling them at a creature within fifty feet or two within the same range, as well as within ten feet of one another. While a warlock's strength of personality is the key attribute powering ''eldritch rain'', fey pact warlocks also use their intellect to increase the lethality of each ray. The spell is not particularly complex, and warlocks require only a short rest of a few minutes between one casting and the next.",
