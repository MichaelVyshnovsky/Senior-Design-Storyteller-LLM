        "mainbody": "'''''Hoard servant''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that functioned in a similar manner to ''[[unseen servant]]'' but was only available to the [[dragon]]s of [[Toril]]. It was popular among [[Metallic dragon|metallic]] and [[gem dragon]]s, as they were much more preoccupied with the status of their horde of treasures.",
        "Effects": "By casting this spell, a dragon summoned an invisible ''unseen servant'' that was stronger and more hearty than its [[humanoid]]-conjured counterpart. The ''unseen servant'' stayed near the hoard of the summoning dragon, stacking coins, organizing chests, and polishing all the [[gem]]s and items cast from precious metals.\n\nThe duration of the spell lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] skill and experience of the caster."
