        "mainbody": "Rushing waters was a conjuration spell that pushed creatures away with conjured water.\nOn casting rushing waters, the caster designated a point within range of the spell. From this point, water started coming out. This water violently spread in a radius of 15 feet (4,6 meters) around and pushed those who were not strong enough to withstand the wave away and possibly even dragging them off their feet.\nRushing waters required only somatic and verbal components, but also a divine focus.\nRushing waters was a spell necessary in the creation of a watery grave and a spell that could be cast using the staff."
