        "Effects": "On casting ''rushing waters'', the caster designated a point within range of the spell. From this point, water started coming out. This water violently spread in a radius of 15 feet (4,6 meters) around and pushed those who were not strong enough to withstand the wave away and possibly even dragging them off their feet.",
        "Components": "''Rushing waters'' required only [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, but also a [[divine focus]].",
        "History": "''Rushing waters'' was a spell necessary in the [[item enchantment|creation]] of a ''[[watery grave]]'' and a spell that could be cast using the [[staff]]."
