        "mainbody": "Dweomerdeny was a wizard spell from the school of enchantment.\nThis spell permanently banished a specific spell from the mind of a spellcaster. The caster needed to touch the target while speaking the incantation. Dweomerdeny did not affect targets who did not use magic.\nThe spell selected by the caster to be erased needed to be memorized by the target when dweomerdeny was cast, otherwise the spell did nothing. In addition to erasing the spell from the targets repertoire, it also prevented them from learning that exact spell again in the future or from using scrolls of the same spell.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
