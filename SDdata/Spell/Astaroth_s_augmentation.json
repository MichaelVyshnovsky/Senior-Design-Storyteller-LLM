        "mainbody": "'''''Astaroth's augmentation''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Gargauth]] called [[Malefactor]]s.",
        "Effects": "Malefactors used this spell to permanently enhance their attributes by calling on Gargauth's divine power. Gargauth extracted a heavy price in exchange for this power, demanding the caster corrupt an individual in power or sacrifice a helpless sentient creature every three months in his name. If the caster ever broke this contract then Gargauth would not only remove the bestowed power for the appropriate attribute, but would proceed to weaken the caster in the same attribute. \n\nThe caster could enter into multiple pacts with Gargauth by casting this spell over and over again, but nothing short of a ''[[wish]]'' or divine intervention could separate the caster from the pact without incurring Gargauth's wrath.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s three yellow feathers, a [[ruby]] worth at least 25 [[gp]] and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
