'''''Sanctify crypt''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priestesses devoted to [[Nephthys]] called [[Goodwive]]s.

==Effects==
Used by Goodwives to seal a burial chamber for all time, ''sanctify crypt'' lasted until the crypt was despoiled by looters who took any valuable items found within or destroyed the mummified remains of the deceased. The looters would incur the terrible ''[[major curse]]'' upon entering the crypt. Furthermore, a member of each looters family would experience the same curse for each generation until the crypt was restored to its previous state.

The curse could be lifted with the ''[[remove major curse]]'' spell, which only affected the direct looter, or the looter's descendants could perform a special quest for the [[Church of Nephthys]] to clear their family's name and remove the curse forever.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] [[gold]] dust to cast. The gold dust needed to be valued at at least 1 [[gp]] per square foot of crypt floor to be sanctified. The gold dust was sprinkled on the floor during the casting.
