Sanctify crypt was a powerful divine abjuration spell used only by specialty priestesses devoted to Nephthys called Goodwives.
Used by Goodwives to seal a burial chamber for all time, sanctify crypt lasted until the crypt was despoiled by looters who took any valuable items found within or destroyed the mummified remains of the deceased. The looters would incur the terrible major curse upon entering the crypt. Furthermore, a member of each looters family would experience the same curse for each generation until the crypt was restored to its previous state.
The curse could be lifted with the remove major curse spell, which only affected the direct looter, or the looters descendants could perform a special quest for the Church of Nephthys to clear their familys name and remove the curse forever.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component gold dust to cast. The gold dust needed to be valued at at least 1 gp per square foot of crypt floor to be sanctified. The gold dust was sprinkled on the floor during the casting.
