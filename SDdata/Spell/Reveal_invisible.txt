Reveal invisibile was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell created an invisible sphere that revealed any invisible creatures and objects located within its range. This worked for natural and magical invisibility. The sphere did not detect planar creatures out of phase or displaced creatures. The caster could center the sphere on themselves or move it around.
This spell did not require material components to cast.
