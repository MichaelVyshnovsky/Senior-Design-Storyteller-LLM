'''''Sanctify spirit host''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Osiris]] called [[Divine Arbitrator]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was used during [[Mulhorandi]] burial rites to ensure the ''ba'', or life force, had safe haven and ''ka'', or spirit twin, traveled safely to the afterlife. The mummified body sanctified by this spell would rise by the power of Osiris if their crypt was ever disturbed, attacking anyone found within. The [[mummy]] was different from others of its kind in that it could only be turned by Divine Arbitrators, did not carry the typical [[mummy rot]] curse, was invulnerable to fire, and was only susceptible to [[holy water]] blessed by priests of [[Set]]. The mummy would return to its rest when the looters were killed or driven from its crypt.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
