Sanctify spirit host was a powerful divine necromancy spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Osiris called Divine Arbitrators.
This spell was used during Mulhorandi burial rites to ensure the ba, or life force, had safe haven and ka, or spirit twin, traveled safely to the afterlife. The mummified body sanctified by this spell would rise by the power of Osiris if their crypt was ever disturbed, attacking anyone found within. The mummy was different from others of its kind in that it could only be turned by Divine Arbitrators, did not carry the typical mummy rot curse, was invulnerable to fire, and was only susceptible to holy water blessed by priests of Set. The mummy would return to its rest when the looters were killed or driven from its crypt.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
