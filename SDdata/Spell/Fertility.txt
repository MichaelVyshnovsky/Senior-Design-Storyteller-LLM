'''''Fertility''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Shiallia]] called [[Woodwive]]s, that had two distinct effects.

==Effects==
The first use of this spell was similar to the ''[[plant growth]]'' spell but affecting {{SI|10|sq mi|k}} and increasing the general health and yields of the affected plants.

The second use of this spell was as a blessing to marriage, practically guaranteeing pregnancy, either by impregnating if cast upon a male target or becoming pregnant if cast upon a female target, within one full day of the spell's casting.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a seed to cast.
