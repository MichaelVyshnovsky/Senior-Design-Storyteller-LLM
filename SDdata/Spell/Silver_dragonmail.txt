'''''Silver dragonmail''''' was a type of [[conjuration]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a breastplate made from [[silver]] on the caster. Sketched on the plates were patterns of dragonscale. The caster also had a choice of either an image of a [[silver dragon]] or [[Torm]]'s [[holy symbol]] to be etched on the breastplate. If the [[armor]] was removed or destroyed, the spell expired. If the caster was already wearing armor, the spell had no effect.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required [[material component]]s including a piece of silver and a chunk of [[mithral]] in the shape of a dragonscale.
