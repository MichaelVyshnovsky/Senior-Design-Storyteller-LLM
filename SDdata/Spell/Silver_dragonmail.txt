Silver dragonmail was a type of conjuration spell.
When cast, this spell created a breastplate made from silver on the caster. Sketched on the plates were patterns of dragonscale. The caster also had a choice of either an image of a silver dragon or Torms holy symbol to be etched on the breastplate. If the armor was removed or destroyed, the spell expired. If the caster was already wearing armor, the spell had no effect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components including a piece of silver and a chunk of mithral in the shape of a dragonscale.
