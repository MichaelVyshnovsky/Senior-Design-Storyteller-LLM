Both the natural agiltity and speed of the undead creatures were temporarily increased. During casting, the caster had to touch the undead for the spell to take effect. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a single drop of quicksilver, three drops of water and the cartilage or sinew of any mammalian species."
