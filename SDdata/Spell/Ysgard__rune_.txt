'''''Ysgard''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune and was considered one of the most powerful.

==Effects==
Once activated, this rune was said to create in place of a doorway a temporary [[portal]] between [[Toril]] and [[Annam All-Father]]'s crystal palace [[Gudheim]] in [[Jotunheim]]. Once closed, this portal could not be re-opened from the [[Outer Planes]].

The number of minutes for which this portal remained open was equivalent to the level of the [[runecaster]] that activated it.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Annam's unblinking eye]]''. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to six weeks and it needed to be inscribed upon a closed doorway.
