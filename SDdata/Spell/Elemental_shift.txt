'''''Elemental shift''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s after the [[Spellplague]].

==Effects==
When sorcerers used ''elemental shift'', they realigned the elemental energies that flowed through them, thus losing their resistances to certain types of energy and replacing them resistance to another, dependent on whether they were [[Sorcerer#Dragon Sorcerer|dragon sorcerers]] or [[Sorcerer#Chaos Sorcerer|chaos sorcerers]]. They could even share this new resistance with an ally close to hand.
