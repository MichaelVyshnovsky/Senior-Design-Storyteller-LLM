Maztica was originally the name of the Maztican goddess of earth and life. It was believed that she, along with her husband and her children (the other deities of the Maztican pantheon), created the land, the plants and animals, and humans. Early in the continents history, the gods Qotal and Zaltec fought over it, until a crime against his sister caused Qotal to retreat from the land for ages.
Later on, the Payit people of Payit and Far Payit built a mighty civilization. They were a peaceful people, but they gained much knowledge and wisdom during their golden age. They also built great cities of stone and made wondrous works of art and pluma. However, the Golden Age of Payit eventually came to an end in treachery and murder.
Shortly after the golden age ended, a tribe of Dog People arrived in the western Valley of Nexal. The Valley of Nexal had its own people, and their own culture, but that small tribe eventually built a city-state of their own, Nexal. They went on to conquer and rule a mighty empire, the greatest in Maztica, for almost 300 years.
Maztica was discovered by Amnian explorers led by Captain Cordell and his Golden Legion in the . Amn was quick to lay its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of Helmsport. The invaders ruthlessly conquered the native peoples and extracted the lands natural resources. The church of Helm playing a key part in this, tainting its reputation back in Faerûn. Lantan also claimed some lands.
Some tlincallis from Maztica teleported to Oaxaptupa under Amn in the Underdark of Faerûn.
During the Spellplague of , Maztica was subsumed by the wild magic and sent to the world of Abeir. People mistakenly believed it was replaced by a continent of that world that was sent to Toril during the catastrophe, Laerakond.Something that cannot be possible, due to Laerakonds being located in the Great Sea, according to Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (page 201). Maztica was returned to Toril during the Second Sundering, around 1486 or . A few tabaxi emigrated to Faerûn after that, although the tabaxi never talked about what changes Maztica may have experienced in her century in another world, besides the fact that there were some strange changes.

Maztica was dominated by the nations of Nexal, Kultaka, Huacli, Kolan, Pezelac and Payit. However, there were many other groups and tribes within its mountains and jungles and deserts.
Maztica was primarily inhabited by humans. These humans were split into four basic ethnic groups, the Payits, the Nexalans, the Green Folk, and the North Ones (more commonly called the Dog People).
* The Payits tended to be short and muscular, and had a strong tradition of learning, art, and astronomy. They mainly occupied the eastern side of Maztica, in the nation of Payit and the jungles of Far Payit.
*The Nexalans were the inhabitants of Central Maztica, holding the nations of Nexal, Huacli, Pezelac, and Kultaka. They were leaner and taller than Payits, with angular features. Their culture was warlike, and they lacked the artistic and scholarly inclinations of their eastern neighbors.
*The Green Folk mostly lived far south of Central Maztica, in the jungles south of the House of Tezca. However, the Kolan people along the western coast was an offshoot of them. They protected their privacy fiercely, and were skilled archers with a tribal society.
*The North Ones, more commonly called the Dog People was another tribal society, but one that dwelled in the desert north of Central Maztica, the Sand of Itzcala. They were extremely loyal, and hardy enough that they could basically ignore pain and privation. They were renowned for their stealth and savage fighting.
In addition, wild halflings were said to live in the deepest jungles of Far Payit, and desert dwarves inhabited the House of Tezca desert.
Many unique monstrous races also lived in Maztica, including
*Chac
*Jagre
*Jaguar lord
*Tlalocoatl
*Kamatlan
