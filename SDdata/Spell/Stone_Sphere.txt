Stone sphere was an evocation spell that conjured a spherical stone that could crush others.
On casting stone sphere, a smooth stone sphere of 5 feet diameter (1,5 meters) appeared within range of this spell. This sphere could be moved around at the casters will. It was entirely possible for the sphere to run over somebody. This was more dangerous as smaller that somebody was, to creatures of truly gargantuan size, stone sphere was effectively harmless.
When the sphere rolled over somebody, it stopped moving until the caster renewed his or her mental effort to move it. It was possible to direct the sphere to merely threaten to run over somebody, forcing that person to make way and putting him or herself in other harms way.
Stone sphere required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a smooth marble sphere of 1 inch diameter (2,5 centimeters).
Stone sphere was one of those spells that beneficiaries of the undermaster spell could cast.
Liths could cast this spell once per day.
