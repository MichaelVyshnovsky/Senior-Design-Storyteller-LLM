Create mythal was an extremely powerful arcane spell that was used to create the mythals for elven locations such as Myth Drannor.
Nine incredibly powerful elven archmages were required to cast this spell in unison. Casting the spell permanently drained a portion of each casters health and vitality. The gods later decided that this spell was too powerful to be trusted to mere mortals and took away the knowledge of casting it.
