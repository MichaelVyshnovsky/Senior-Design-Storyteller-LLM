'''''Create mythal''''' was an extremely powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] that was used to create the [[mythal]]s for [[elven]] locations such as [[Myth Drannor]].

==History==
Nine incredibly powerful elven [[archmage]]s were required to cast this spell in unison. Casting the spell permanently drained a portion of each caster's health and vitality. The gods later decided that this spell was too powerful to be trusted to mere mortals and took away the knowledge of casting it.
