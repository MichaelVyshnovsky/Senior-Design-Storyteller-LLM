Duhlarks long reach was an arcane alteration and conjuration spell that created a magical arm under the casters control.
The arm created by this spell was formed out of any material present at the casting location and could be the size of a regular human arm or giant sized depending on the skill of the caster. However, once formed the arm was stationary and its size could not be changed.
The caster could direct the arm to hold objects or creatures, punch enemies, knock down walls, etc. The caster could even use the arm to deliver touch-based spells to a target. The durability of the arm depended on the material it was composed of. The arm would collapse into a pile of its raw materials if destroyed.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small piece of wood or stone and a pinch of sulphur to cast.
This spell was developed by Duhlark Kolat, a powerful mage from Waterdeep. Watch wizards of the Watch of Waterdeep were fond of using this spell to apprehend criminals, dubbing it the "Long Arm of the Law."
