        "mainbody": "Blur was an illusion spell that made the contours of a caster \"blurry\".\nWhen under this spell, the caster would become harder to hit as they did not appear to have a solid form any more.\nThe older versions of the spell needed verbal and somatic components, but the later version only needed a verbal component.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Smolyn in  and was originally called Smolyns blurring."
