        "mainbody": "Bladebane was a transmutation spell that caused a bladed weapon to be temporarily more harmful to a specific type of creature.\nBy use of this spell, the caster bestowed upon one bladed weapon with the bane quality, focused against a type of being of the casters choosing. The enhanced weapon struck these creatures more often, and inflicted more damage upon them. The cleric had to be able to touch the weapon, and the effect last only a short time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a drop of blood and an amount of ruby dust worth at least 500 gp."
