        "mainbody": "'''Bladebane''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that caused a [[blade|bladed weapon]] to be temporarily more harmful to a specific type of creature.",
        "Effect": "By use of this spell, the caster bestowed upon one bladed weapon with the ''[[bane (propery)|bane]]'' quality, focused against a type of being of the caster's choosing. The enhanced weapon struck these creatures more often, and inflicted more damage upon them. The cleric had to be able to touch the weapon, and the effect last only a short time.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a drop of blood and an amount of ''[[ruby]]'' dust worth at least 500 [[gp]]."
