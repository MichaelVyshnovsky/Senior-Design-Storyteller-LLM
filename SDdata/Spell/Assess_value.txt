Assess value was a southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Nephthys.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster hold an object and accurately determine the market value, but not the artistic or cultural value, of an object. The object had to be smaller than the caster. The spell was unable to determine an objects magical properties or to detect if an object had magical properties.
This spell required only somatic and verbal components.
