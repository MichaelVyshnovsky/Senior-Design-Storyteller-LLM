'''''Undead aides''''' was a rare [[spell]] used by [[necromancer]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell gave a [[skeleton]] or [[zombie]] limited sentience and the ability to perform simple tasks. The amount of skeletons or zombies affected was based on the caster's skill level. The targeted [[undead]] was able to speak, and could react to situations. The spell lasted as long as the skeleton or zombie was animated.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required [[material component]]s, a brain from a [[dragon]] and bone fragments from a [[human]].
==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
