Sphere of ultimate destruction is a very powerful sorcerer and wizard spell that conjures a featureless black sphere of nothingness that destroys everything in its path. 
Creatures who are struck by the sphere have a slim chance of surviving, but will most likely be disintegrated, along with any non-living matter. Upon striking a creature, the sphere will stop moving and wait to be directed to a new target by its caster. If the sphere moves beyond the range of the spell, it winks out of existence.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature.
The history of this spell is unknown, but it was in common use in the Unapproachable East some time around 1373 DR.
