Ray of sickness was a spell that poisoned a target.
When cast, a ray of energy erupted from the caster to the target creature. The ray was noxious green in color. It was able to target a single creature within 60 feet (18 meters) of the caster. As a result, the target creature became poisoned. It suffered the effects of poisoning until the spell expired. The strength of the poison was determined by the casters skill level.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
