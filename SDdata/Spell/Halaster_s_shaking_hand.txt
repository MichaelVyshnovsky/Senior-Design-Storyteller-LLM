'''''Halaster's shaking hand''''' was a [[evocation]] [[spell]] that functioned exactly like ''[[Bigby's interposing hand]]'', except that the hand was capable of grappling or otherwise wrestling with the effects of [[Bigby's hand]] spells that have been evoked. When two of these [[arcane]] hands wrestled with one another, it resembled a large disembodied handshake.

The spell was developed by the powerful [[archmage]] that dwelled within the [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].
