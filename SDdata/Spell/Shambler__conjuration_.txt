Shambler was a druidic conjuration spell that summoned a subservient shambling mound.
The shambler spell could summon a shambling mound anywhere within the casters sight and the creature disappeared eight hours later. Such shambling mounds were friendly toward the summoner druid and willingly fulfilled all orders and tasks they had capability to carry out.
