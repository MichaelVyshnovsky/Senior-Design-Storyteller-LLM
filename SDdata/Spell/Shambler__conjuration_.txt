'''''Shambler''''' was a [[druid]]ic [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that summoned a subservient [[shambling mound]].

==Effects==
The ''shambler'' spell could summon a shambling mound anywhere within the caster's sight and the creature disappeared eight hours later. Such shambling mounds were friendly toward the summoner druid and willingly fulfilled all orders and tasks they had capability to carry out.
