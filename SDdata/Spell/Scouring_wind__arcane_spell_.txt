'''''Scouring wind''''' was a [[spell]] that created a dangerous draft of wind with small projectiles in it.

==Effects==
The effect was rather similar to a ''[[gust of wind]]'', except it lasted for about four minutes. Furthermore, small teeth made of force tumbled along the current, stabbing, slicing, and hammering at all things caught there that harmed creatures in the area for the duration, and all objects were at risk of getting crushed.

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required as [[material component]]s a seed once blown by the wind and a small piece of glass.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
