        "Effects": "On casting ''Illumination'', the caster was surrounded by golden light. In this state, the caster was not affected by any [[magic]] that did not involve cold, darkness, or shadow.\n\nHow long this state persisted depended on perspective for the flow of time was altered. For the caster, the spell took seven minutes to end, for all others, the spell's duration was merely a minute. During those seven minutes, the caster could do nothing. He or she could not cast other spells, turn invisible, simply move, or do anything else except for asking up to seven yes-or-no questions to his or her [[deity]]. The deity, apart from answering \"yes, \"no\", and \"I don't know\", could give answers that would help the caster make decisions and were also tailored to furthering its own agenda.\n\nAnother way to use ''illumination'' was to convert its power into a one-shot ''[[cure blindness or deafness]]'', ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[prayer]]'', or ''[[free action]]'' or up to four ''[[cure light wounds]]'' all on the caster him- or herself, instead of asking questions. Doing this ended the spell.",
        "Components": "''Illumination'' required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s in the form of a [[holy symbol]] and [[holy water]]."
