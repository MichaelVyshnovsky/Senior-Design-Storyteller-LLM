        "mainbody": "'''''Mirror vestments''''' was a [[divine]] [[abjuration]] spell that surrounded the caster with a protective aura.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a reflective aura that outlined the caster's person. This barrier absorbed some of the [[spell]]s or spell-like abilities directed towards them and redirected them back to their respective sources. ''Mirror vestments'' did not reflect all spells, rather all of those those from a single [[sphere]] or [[school of magic]], as specified by the casting cleric.\n\nThe duration of this spell lasted at least 10 minutes, but increased with the experience of the caster.",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the holy [[relic]], the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]''.",
        "Components": "''Mirror vestments'' required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
