        "mainbody": "Mirror vestments was a divine abjuration spell that surrounded the caster with a protective aura.\nWhen cast, this spell created a reflective aura that outlined the casters person. This barrier absorbed some of the spells or spell-like abilities directed towards them and redirected them back to their respective sources. Mirror vestments did not reflect all spells, rather all of those those from a single sphere or school of magic, as specified by the casting cleric.\nThe duration of this spell lasted at least 10 minutes, but increased with the experience of the caster.\nThis spell was inscribed within the holy relic, the Tome of the Morning.\nMirror vestments required only verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
