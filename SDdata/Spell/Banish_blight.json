        "mainbody": "'''''Banish blight''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]] that enabled them to eradicate plant diseases. It was also available to priests of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]] and [[Rillifane Rallathil]].",
        "Effects": "When the caster touched and breathed on some part of a plant, this spell would cure it of all existing diseases on a lasting basis. The spell would also restore the plant to pristine condition, thus healing damage done by being partially eaten, frozen, scorched, wilted, or shriveled, causing flowers to bloom again and brown leaves to turn green, anything short of bringing a dead plant back to life or restoring missing pieces. This latter effect lasted for several days depending on the skill of the caster. If natural conditions were ideal for the plant's growth, then the restored condition would outlast the spell, with it returning to its natural growing cycle. However, it could not be used to make a natural plant grow larger or become hardier.\n\n''Banish blight'' would also heal damage done to animate [[plant creature]]s like [[shambling mound]]s and [[treant]]s, though it could not make them more resilient.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.",
        "Usage": "With this spell, a withered plant would became green and hale even in the coldest part of winter, a defoliated hedge could become a thick barrier, and a wilted flower made to bloom again could be plucked and kept fresh until the spell expired.",
        "History": "Mielikki created this spell as a gift to [[Silvanus]] to restore partially eaten vegetation and to encourage her faithful to feed forest creatures with nearly endless amounts of plant food.\n\nIt was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
