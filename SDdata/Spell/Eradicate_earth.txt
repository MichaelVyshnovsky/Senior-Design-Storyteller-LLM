Eradicate earth was an abjuration spell that was dangerous for creatures who had elemental earth as part of its being.
Eradicate earth was a very straightforward spell. On casting it, the caster released an inaudible explosion of force. This explosion had a radius of 40 feet (12 meters) and severely hurt creatures that had elemental earth as part of its being.As dangerous this spell was to these creatures, it was harmless to others.
Eradicate earth required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component took the form of a small stone. This stone was gripped and the gripping hand was thrust forward at the end of the casting. The stone disappeared and the explosion happened.
