        "mainbody": "Detect living was a divine necromancy and divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Jergal called Doomscribes.\nThis spell revealed the location of living things within a  sphere to the caster by marking them with an aura visible only to the caster. More intelligent creatures glowed with a brighter aura. The spell would mark targets that were even hidden by magical means.\nThe Scriveners of Doom developed this spell as a defense against ambush as well as to locate mortals attempting to flee from eternal rest.\nThis spell required only  verbal and somatic components to cast."
