        "mainbody": "'''''Spellstrike''''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] spell that could cancel another spell, even retroactively.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast instantly at any spell or spell-like ability that the caster could sense was happening within range. For example, he or she could see a ''[[fireball]]'' or hear a ''[[power word, blind]]'' spell and react with ''spellstrike'' to completely negate the targeted effect. The targeted spell had to be cast no more than one minute before ''spellstrike'' and be within 180 yd (165 m) of the caster (more experienced casters could extend this range). Knowledge of the type of magic being targeted was not required, only a noticeable effect. The energies of the targeted spell were not absorbed or deflected, they simply ceased to exist, even retroactively, such that it was as if the spell had never been cast. However, the memorized spell and any spell components used in casting the targeted spell were still lost.\n\n''Spellstrike'' did not work against magical items, nor did it negate ''[[wish]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', or ''[[contingency]]'' spells, but could prevent ''[[permanency]]''.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Three|851}}",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the famed [[transmuter]] [[Nezram]] and set down in his book ''[[Unique Mageries]]'', which he left behind and never returned to claim. ''Spellstrike'' was later published in \"[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]\" and became generally known to the magical community although it was rare to find it.\n\n[[Phaerimm]] knew this spell. The sword [[Tahlshara]] had the ability to invoke this magic.{{cite book/Elves of Evermeet|71}}"
