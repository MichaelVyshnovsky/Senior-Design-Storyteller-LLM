        "mainbody": "Spellstrike was an arcane alteration spell that could cancel another spell, even retroactively.\nThis spell could be cast instantly at any spell or spell-like ability that the caster could sense was happening within range. For example, he or she could see a fireball or hear a power word, blind spell and react with spellstrike to completely negate the targeted effect. The targeted spell had to be cast no more than one minute before spellstrike and be within 180 yd (165 m) of the caster (more experienced casters could extend this range). Knowledge of the type of magic being targeted was not required, only a noticeable effect. The energies of the targeted spell were not absorbed or deflected, they simply ceased to exist, even retroactively, such that it was as if the spell had never been cast. However, the memorized spell and any spell components used in casting the targeted spell were still lost.\nSpellstrike did not work against magical items, nor did it negate wish, limited wish, or contingency spells, but could prevent permanency.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nThis spell was invented by the famed transmuter Nezram and set down in his book Unique Mageries, which he left behind and never returned to claim. Spellstrike was later published in \"Volos Guide to All Things Magical\" and became generally known to the magical community although it was rare to find it.\nPhaerimm knew this spell. The sword Tahlshara had the ability to invoke this magic."
