Magic Circle against Law was an abjuration spell that created a sphere of warding against mental and physical attacks from lawful creatures.
This spell operated just like magic circle against evil except that it extended the area of effect for protection from law rather than protection from evil, and it could trap a nonchaotic summoned creature.
