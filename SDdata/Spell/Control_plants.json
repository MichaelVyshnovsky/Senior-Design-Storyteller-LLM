        "mainbody": "'''''Control plants''''' was a [[divine magic|divine spell]] that granted the caster control over plants and [[plant creature]]s. It was known to [[druids]] as well as to [[clerics]] with access to the [[Plant domain]].",
        "Effects": "The [[spell]] allowed the caster to exert direct control over one or more plant creatures for several minutes, although the plants would resist suicidal orders. Their actions had to be directed via verbal command, and the plants would obey regardless of whether they could understand the language. In the absence of any orders, the plants would avoid attacking the caster for the duration of the spell. At the end of the spell's effect, the plant creatures reverted to their normal behaviors.\n\nA weaker version of this spell was said to have broader effects. It granted the ability to communicate in simple terms with all manner of plant life&mdash;including [[fungi]], [[mold]]s, and plantlike monsters such as [[shambling mounds]]&mdash;as well as to command mundane plants to provide information, to clear or obstruct a path, or even to wrap around enemies (duplicating the effects of an ''[[entangle]]'' spell, and also serving as an effective counter to that spell). Commands could also be issued to plant creatures, although they had a chance of rejecting the caster's influence.<ref group=\"note\">This spell underwent a major revision between [[3rd edition]] and [[3.5 edition]] in which it may have been either confused for or remixed with ''[[command plants]]''.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s as well as a [[divine focus]]."
