It caused one target creature to briefly feel drowsy, which resulted in a yawn, and made them more susceptible to sleep spells.\nThis cantrip was had a range of  and could target one creature. If the target resisted the magic of this spell, then it had no effect. If they failed to resist, then the target involuntarily yawned and, depending on the size or toughness of the creature, was subject to enhanced effects of a sleep spell for the next minute or two. Specifically, the subject of yawn fell into a coma-like slumber instead of a light doze. The victim of yawn also did not count toward the total number of creatures that the sleep spell could affect.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster cupped both hands together and rocked them like a cradle while humming a lullaby."
