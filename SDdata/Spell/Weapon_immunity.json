        "mainbody": "Weapon immunity was a protection spell of the southern magic tradition that granted the caster immunity to a specific type of weapon for a short time.\nFor a few minutes (longer for more experienced casters), the caster became immune to damage from a specific type of weapon such as all longswords. This protection included magical versions of those weapons, but not other distinct types (e.g., not bastard swords or short swords). This spell did not function on natural weapons such as fists, claws, or fangs. Only one weapon immunity could be active at a time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of either amethyst, jade or lapis lazuli to cast."
