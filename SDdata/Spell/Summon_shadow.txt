Summon shadow was a necromancy spell that conjured shadows.
The shadows summoned by this spell were under the control of the caster, and could be used to attack foes. Such conjured creatures would remain for a length of time proportional to the power of the caster (a minimum of six minutes), or until they were turned or killed. The creatures appeared in a  cube at a range of up to  from the caster.
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material component was a small piece of smoky quartz.
The spell was invented in the , by the Netherese arcanist, known as Shadow, with the original name being Shadows summons.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast summon shadow within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
Summon shadows was used by casters with access to the Negative Energy plane in order to summon dread wolves, as well as—rarely—shairs of Zakhara.
