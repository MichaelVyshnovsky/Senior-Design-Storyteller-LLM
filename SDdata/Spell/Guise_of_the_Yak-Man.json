        "Effects": "The spell made the target appear as a vile [[yak-man]] as far as all of the physical senses were concerned. Only a ''[[true seeing]]'' spell could pierce this illusion. This spell could only be dispelled through a ''[[wish]]''. This illusion was so strong that even creatures, such as [[undead]], that were normally immune to illusions, were affected.\n\nWhile under the guise of a yak-man, the target would never be harmed or hindered by a [[dao]]. However, most civilized folk of Zakhara despised the yak-men, so the target could not encounter other [[humanoid]]s without being attacked on sight.",
        "Components": "This spell required a hair from a yak-man to cast."
