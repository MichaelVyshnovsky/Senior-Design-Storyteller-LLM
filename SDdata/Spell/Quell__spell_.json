        "mainbody": "'''''Quell''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "Wu jen used this spell to overpower a creature. The target creature instantly surrendered to the wu jen. Additionally, a wu jen could use this spell to compel the target creature into a period of service. This part of the spell was only effective if the creature understood the language spoken by the wu jen. The task a wu jen demanded was dependent on certain conditions. A wu jen was unable to compel the creature to do a deadly task, and the task had to be within the understanding of the creature. When the task was successfully completed, the spell expired.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. During casting, the wu jen uttered the verbal components while pointing at the target creature."
