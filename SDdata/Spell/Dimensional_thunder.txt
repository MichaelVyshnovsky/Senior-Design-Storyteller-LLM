Dimensional thunder was a teleportation spell used by swordmages, most often those of the raging storm path, who preferred to use the forces of thunder and lightning together. With dimensional thunder a swordmage could cut a hole in the fabric of the Prime, slipping through into to another location, how far away depending on the swordmages constitution. In the process, the swordmage brought with him or her a wake of thunderous sound, which could be deadly to nearby enemies and which boomed outward from the swordmages weapon. The sound echoed for some time afterward, causing continuous pain to a swordmages adversaries. It was not an easy spell to cast, however, and could only be used once per day.
