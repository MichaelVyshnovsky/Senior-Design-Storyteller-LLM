'''''Faith-magic zone''''', or '''''faith magic zone''''', was a [[divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that caused any non-divine [[magic]] to be less effective within a given area.

==Description==
The zone was not visible to any person or creature within the area of its casting. Only a small, silver radiance emanated from [[priest]]s upon the spell's casting.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a sphere, 180 feet (58.9 meters) in diameter that slowed down any spells that were cast by [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s, or other non-divine spellcasters. In addition, any [[magical item]]s that drew upon [[arcane]] or other non-clerical spells functioned with less effectiveness.

Any people or creatures within the zone that were targeted by arcane spells or similar abilities gained significant protection against these types of magic.

The zone lasted for a few minutes and could be readily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the [[holy symbol]] of the [[cleric]] casting it, as well as a vial of [[honey]] that had been collected from a honeycomb.

==Usage==
This spell was relatively well-known among the [[druid]]s and other members of the [[Emerald Enclave]].
