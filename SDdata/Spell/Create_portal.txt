Create portal was an alteration spell used by spelljamming mages to open a temporary opening in a crystal sphere to pass into or out of the phlogiston.
If the spellcaster was within  of the surface of a crystal sphere, this spell could cause an area of the sphere  in radius to become immaterial, allowing a spelljamming vessel to pass through. Such a portal would last for at least a couple minutes or as long as almost a quarter of an hour before dissipating, giving a ship plenty of time to pass through safely. However, if the duration ended while a ship were in transition&mdashor if the spells magic was dispelled&mdashthe reformation of the wall of the crystal sphere could cut a ship in half.
A crystal shell was in no way weakened by this temporary magic portal in fact, if any objects happened to be touching the area of effect, such objects would remain where they were. Multiple vessels could easily follow a first through a created portal.
Create portal required verbal and somatic components and a wire wrapped around a piece of amber.
