'''''Bane of Beshaba''''', also called '''''Beshaba's arsekick''''', was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Beshaba]].

This spell was similar, with negative impacts, to the ''[[Favor of Tymora]]'' spell. In fact, both of these spells would cancel each other out if used on the same target.

==Effects==
This spell cursed a single target touched by a priest of Beshaba. The curse could not be cancelled by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or other similar methods. The spell lasted either until its power was exhausted or the target perished. In a sense the spell made it more difficult for the target to resist negative effects from spells and similar situations. The curse weakened with each instance until it expired. A target could only be affected by one casting of this spell at a time.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of broken [[mirror]] and the cleric's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
