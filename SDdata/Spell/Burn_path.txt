'''''Burn path''''' was a very rare [[abjuration]]/[[necromancy]] [[spell]] that wiped out the knowledge of one [[Path magic|path of magic]] the victim followed.

==Effects==
This spell permanently erased the acquired ability to cast the spells of one path learned by a [[wizard]], as well as those spells already memorized. They could only be relearned as new spells in the future. If the victim withstood the magic of ''burn path'', she still suffered the effect of ''[[seal path]]'' instead.These limiting conditions were only introduced in the ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium]]'' and not part of the description in the original ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' article.

==Components==
In addition to using [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''burn path'' required a costly scroll of beaten [[gold]] bearing the formula of the first spell of the targeted path of magic.

==Relation==
''Burn path'', following ''[[close path]]'' and ''seal path'', was the culmination of the rarely found Path of Paths, dreaded by followers of [[path magic]] as it directly attacked their spellcasting ability.
