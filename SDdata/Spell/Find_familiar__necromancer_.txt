'''''Find familiar''''' was a common [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell was almost identical to ''[[find familiar]]'', except it could only be cast be [[necromancer]]s. Using this spell, a caster could gain a familiar of only certain species. These species were: a [[bat]], a [[cat|black cat]], a [[frog]], a [[giant centipede]], a [[giant rat]], an [[imp]], a [[large spider]], a [[quasit]] or a [[raven]]. Imps and quasits would only become familiars to a powerful necromancer. If the familiar was killed, the caster suffered extreme pain.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, which were the same as the ''find familiar'' spell: a high-quality charcoal, [[incense]] and [[herb]]s that needed to be burned in a [[brazier]] made of [[brass]] as part of the ritual. These materials cost at least 2,000 [[gp]]. The caster was only able to cast this spell once a month, during a full moon.

==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
