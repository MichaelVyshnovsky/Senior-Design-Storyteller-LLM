        "mainbody": "'''''Vampiric embrace''''' is a simple but deadly [[spell]] used most often by [[Warlock#Infernal Pact Warlock|infernal pact]] [[warlock]]s, though other warlocks may also learn it. When cast ''vampiric embrace'' allows its caster to extend a strand of [[necromancy|necrotic]] energy into the life force of a creature within twenty-five feet, sapping its vitality to temporarily fuel the warlock's own. The potency of the spell is largely determined by the warlock's regular health, and those of the infernal pact use an even deadlier version of the spell. The spell does not come easily, however, and a warlock must rest for a few minutes after using it if he or she wishes to cast it again. ''Vampiric embrace'' is similar, but not identical, to the ''[[devour magic]]'' spell.",
