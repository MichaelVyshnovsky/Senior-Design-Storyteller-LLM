'''''Dust''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It removed all fine particles and grit from a small area, sending it elsewhere.

==Effects==
The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and only worked on open surfaces within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the target point. All tiny dust and grit particles on shelves, walls, furniture, floors, ''etc.'' within the area of effect were transported to an unknown location. This cantrip could not remove dust-like substances from inside closed containers like a [[snuff box]] or a [[makeup]] [[jar]].

==Components==
The cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. A hand was waved back and forth while performing a slow inhalation of breath for a few seconds.
