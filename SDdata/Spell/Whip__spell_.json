        "mainbody": "Whip was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell conjured a powerful whip composed of magical force. A wu jen used this spell when they required a weapon for melee combat or to ward away an animal. The whip acted exactly like a normal whip, but with an added effect. When a creature was struck by the whip, their desire to continue fighting drained away.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a small whip made of silk."
