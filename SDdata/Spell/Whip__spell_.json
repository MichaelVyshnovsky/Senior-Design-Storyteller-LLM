        "mainbody": "'''''Whip''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "The spell conjured a powerful whip composed of magical force. A wu jen used this spell when they required a weapon for melee combat or to ward away an animal. The whip acted exactly like a normal whip, but with an added effect. When a creature was struck by the whip, their desire to continue fighting drained away.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a small whip made of [[silk]]."
