        "mainbody": "'''''Wall of shadow''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Eshowdow]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created a permanent wall or ring of twilight the size of which depended on the skill of the caster. The \"wall\" version of this spell was always oriented vertically. A ''wall of shadow'' acted like an impenetrable ''[[wall of force]]'' to anything connected to the [[Negative Energy plane]] or the [[Shadowfell]]. Any creature not connected to the Shadowfell or Negative Energy plane that passed through the ''wall of shadow'' would experience the effects of an ''[[enervation]]'' spell that lasted for several hours.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the priest's holy symbol and an area of shadow to cast."
