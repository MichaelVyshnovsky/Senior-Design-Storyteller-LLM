        "mainbody": "Tie was a useful cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It caused the end of a rope-like item to form a knot around another object of similar shape.\nThis spell worked on rope-like objects from as small as a thread to as large as a cable. The object to be connected had to be within  of the rope (with enough slack to form a knot) and had to resemble a rope in some fashion (a ring, loop, rod, another rope, or the end of the same rope) for the knot to be completed. Any common knot (square, half-hitch, bowline etc.) familiar to the caster could be tied.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The name of the knot was spoken as the caster held up three fingers.\nThe untitled book known as Briels Book of Shadows described this cantrip along with exterminate, wilt, and smokepuff.The four cantrips described in Dragon #97 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
