        "Description": "An [[evocation school|evocation]] spell, ''thunderwave'' created a blast of sonic energy that could cause bodily harm to any enemies within an area of {{SI|15|ft}} of the spell, in addition to pushing them backwards, away from the blast zone. The distance a creature caught in the blast was pushed depended upon the caster's degree of self-control and perception. The spell dissipated almost instantaneously."
