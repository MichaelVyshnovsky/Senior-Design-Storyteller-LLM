        "mainbody": "Flame arrows, sometimes known as flame arrow, was a transmutation spell that either ignited a certain number of arrows or bolts with fire,\nUpon touching a quiver containing arrows or bolts, the caster imbued the ammunition inside with fire for up to one hour, for as long as the caster kept concentrating on the spell. The power could affect each arrow only once per casting. Initially, a maximum of 12 arrows could be imbued each time, but more powerful castings could increase this number.\nAlternately, the caster could hurl launch one or more conjured magical bolts of flame towards their opponent. The number of projectiles they created was dependent on their experience and skill as a spellcaster.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Primidon in  and was originally known as Primidons arrow.\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast flame arrows within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization."
