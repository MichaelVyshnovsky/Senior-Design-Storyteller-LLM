        "mainbody": "'''''Maddening darkness''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created an area of darkness that caused psychic damage to those within.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created a sphere of darkness with a radius of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. The sphere was malleable, able to bend around corners and other obstacles. The darkness was nearly impenetrable, [[darkvision]] and mundane light sources were rendered useless within the sphere. Only light from the most powerful magical source or spell was able to penetrate the darkness, spells such as ''[[light]]'' did not. Creatures within the sphere heard disturbing sounds and were inflicted with severe psychic damage.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a minute amount of [[mercury]] and pitch. These were combined during casting."
