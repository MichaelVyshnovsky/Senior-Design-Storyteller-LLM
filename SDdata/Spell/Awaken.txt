'''''Awaken''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that awakened intelligence and ability in a creature or plant of little or no intelligence.

==Effects==
After eight hours of casting and touching a creature of little or no intelligence, the creature would gain average intelligence (compared to [[humanoids]]) and learn the language of the caster. Plants also gained the ability to move their "limbs". The creature was effectively [[charm]]ed by the caster for thirty days; after that, the creature could chose to stay or turn hostile to the caster.

==Components==
An [[agate]] worth at least 1,000 [[gp]].
