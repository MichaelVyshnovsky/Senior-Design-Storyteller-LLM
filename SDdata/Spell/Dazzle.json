        "Effects": "Any creature caught within the 12' (3.7 m) area of effect created by this spell was partially blinded for a matter of moments. As a result, they were less capable in combat and had difficulty performing skilled tasks. Those who could shake off the spell's effects overcame the blindness much more rapidly."
