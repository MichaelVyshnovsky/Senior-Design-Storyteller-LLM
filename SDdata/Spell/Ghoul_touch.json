        "mainbody": "'''''Ghoul touch''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that could paralyze a single target.",
        "Effects": "When ''ghoul touch'' was in effect, the touch of the caster had a chance to paralyze their victim. However, the deadly touch would only affect [[human]]s, [[halfling]]s, [[dwarves]], [[half-elves]], and [[gnomes]]. The more powerful the caster, the longer the duration of the paralysis was.\n\nAs well as paralyzing the target, the spell would make the target emit a nausea-inducing stench, causing those caught within {{SI|10|ft}} to have a higher chance to miss their attacks.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component|material]] components. The material component could either be a piece of cloth from the garments of a [[ghoul]] or some earth where the ghoul had made its lair."
