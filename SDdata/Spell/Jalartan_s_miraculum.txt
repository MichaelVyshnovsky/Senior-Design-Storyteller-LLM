Jalartans miraculum was an alteration wizard spell.
The caster would use this spell to alter another spell they had memorized. Jalartans miraculum allowed the caster to cast another spell without needing one of that spells primary components, allowing the caster to forgo either physical gestures, spoken incantations, or the need to use a physical spell component. If the spell only needed one of these components to cast then the caster would be able to cast the spell as a silent act of will.
There was no time limit that needed to be met after casting this spell for it to affect the casters next spell.
This spell only required somatic components to cast.
