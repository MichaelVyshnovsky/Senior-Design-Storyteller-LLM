Improved mage armor was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards. It was a more powerful version of mage armor. It is extremely similar to greater mage armor.
When cast, whomever the caster touched was enveloped in an invisible force field that protected the target in much the same way as mundane armor, yet without any of its penalties, such as restricted movement or weight. Because it was a force field, incorporeal creatures or objects could not pass through it.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small shield made from platinum with a value of at least 100 gp.
