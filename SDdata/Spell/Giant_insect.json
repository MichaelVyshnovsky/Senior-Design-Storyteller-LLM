        "mainbody": "Giant insect, also known as giant vermin,  was a transmutation or alteration spell that allowed the caster to grow centipedes, scorpions, spiders, beetles, flies, wasps or, similar creatures to much larger than their original size. The reverse of the spell, shrink insect, could reduce giant insects down to normal size.\nOnly one type of creature could be affected per casting of these spells. The older version only worked on true insects, not spiders or scorpions, which are arachnids. The giant bugs were not hostile toward the spellcaster and could follow simple commands to attack or defend, hold position, follow, etc.\nOnly verbal and somatic components, plus the priests holy symbol were required to cast these spells."
