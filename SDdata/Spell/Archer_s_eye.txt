Archers eye was an utterance from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used truespeak to allow a subject to strike true regardless of concealment, or protect them from ranged weapons, if reversed.
In its straight form, the utterance granted the target the power to strike true regardless of concealment with any ranged weapon they wielded. In its reversed form, it was akin to the protection from arrows spell, making arrows miss their mark, or fall from the air instead of striking.
The utterance was known to word archons.
