Ice blade was a divine magic spell given to specialty priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It produced whirling formation of ice crystals in the shape of a sword that the caster could wield with great skill.
When cast, a four-foot (1.2 meters) force blade, 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide, made up of swirling ice shards grew out of the casters hand to form a sword-like shape. It weighed nothing to the caster and was considered a +2 magical weapon. The flying shards moved around obstacles, like small shields, parrying weapons, or trees, giving the wielder an exceptionally high chance to hit any creature that it passed through. On a successful attack, it lacerated the target like a blizzard of sharp ice and did additional damage from magical cold. A sweeping maneuver could attack more than one creature in range of the blade with no combat penalties.
The ice blade lasted long enough to make seven consecutive attacks or actions (higher level casters could extend the duration) and then faded away.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component small shard of ice, glass, or crystal to cast.
