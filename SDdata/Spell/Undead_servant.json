        "mainbody": "Undead servant was a necromancy spell that allowed the caster to temporarily reanimate the remains of a humanoid creature.\nUpon casting this spell, a deceased person or creature was brought back as a skeleton or zombie. It affected the remains of any human-sized creature or smaller, as long as it was humanoid in form. The undead creature obeyed simple commands given by the caster for the duration of an hour or more, or until it was destroyed or dispelled.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as the material component of a pinch of dirt from a graveyard.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
