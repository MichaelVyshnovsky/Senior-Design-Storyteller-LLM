Fire touch was a spell that would provide extra fire damage to an allys attacks.
Once touched, the recipient would be surrounded by a blazing aura. The aura itself would lend its energy to every attack, causing an enemy to take additional fire damage. The blazing aura did not harm whoever it surrounded.
The spell was used by some powerful magic-users in north and northwest Faerûn, specifically in the Savage Frontier and Moonsea regions.
