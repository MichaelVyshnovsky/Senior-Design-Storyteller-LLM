        "mainbody": "Ahghairons dragonward was a powerful mythal cast by the famous mage Ahghairon over the city of Waterdeep. \nCentered under Ahghairons Tower, the mythal projected a permanent dome  in diameter, Undermountain, beneath the city, was unaffected by the Dragonward. In 1492DR, the effect did not extend to the harbor.\nthumb|The Borders of Aghairons Dragonward, positioned and drawn to scale.\nAny creature with draconic blood that tried to enter the city was overcome with an overwhelming urge to leave the area, never to return. However, any draconic creature that touched the Dragonstaff of Ahghairon was able to bypass the dragonward for as long as the staffs wielder allowed or until the creature was struck by the staff.\nIn the midâ€“11 century DR, Ranressa Shiard returned as a hero from her journeys to Waterdeep atop the mighty copper dragon Galadaeros. Although she was welcomed home, the appearance of her mount flying over the city unsettled the majority of the populace. Ahghairon crafted this mythal to allay their fears."
