        "mainbody": "'''''Sarcophagus of death''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Set]] called [[Nighthunter]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a ''[[cube of force]]'' in the shape of a coffin around a target chosen by the Nighthunter. The coffin was airtight and impervious to magic save for a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell. The only way to escape the coffin from the inside was via a ''[[Teleport|teleportation]]'' spell. Simply being inside the coffin caused physical harm as well as drained the target's overall constitution. Targets trapped within the ''sarcophagus of death'' stood a likely chance of death by asphyxiation.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and fragment of a sarcophagus consecrated by a priest of [[Osiris]] or [[Nephthys]] to cast."
