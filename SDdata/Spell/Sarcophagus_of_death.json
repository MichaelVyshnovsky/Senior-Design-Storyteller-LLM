        "mainbody": "Sarcophagus of death was a divine evocation spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Set called Nighthunters.\nThis spell created a cube of force in the shape of a coffin around a target chosen by the Nighthunter. The coffin was airtight and impervious to magic save for a dispel magic spell. The only way to escape the coffin from the inside was via a teleportation spell. Simply being inside the coffin caused physical harm as well as drained the targets overall constitution. Targets trapped within the sarcophagus of death stood a likely chance of death by asphyxiation.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and fragment of a sarcophagus consecrated by a priest of Osiris or Nephthys to cast."
