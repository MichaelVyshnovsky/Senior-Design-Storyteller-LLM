        "mainbody": "'''''Fire purge''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that prevented normal fires and dampened magical fires in an area.",
        "Effects": "Within the protected area, normal fires refused to burn and magical fires were reduced to half intensity. Note that this spell did not affect fires that were already burning at the time of casting, it simply prevented ignition of new fires. Magical fires, including ''[[burning hands]]'', ''[[fire seeds]]'', ''[[fireball]]'' and even fiery [[dragon breath]] were dampened, allowing the targets of a fire attack a better chance to resist or avoid the fire and reducing any resulting damage.\n\nThe area of effect was a {{SI|10|sq. yd|long=yes}} and lasted ten minutes. This spell could be cast cooperatively with other priests, increasing the protected area exponentially and prolonging the duration.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell as well as the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a sliver of wood that had been scorched by fire."
