        "mainbody": "Repel undead was a necromantic abjuration spell used to drive undead creatures away from the caster.\nThis spell created a powerful compulsion within undead creatures, prompting them to avoid the caster. If any kind of physical barrier prevented the undead from doing this then they simply kept as much distance between them and the caster as possible. This spell was centered on the caster and moved about with them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components this spell required a magnet with a drop of the casters blood placed at one end and a bone fragment placed at the other.\nRepel undead spell was originally developed by the tiefling Grand Vizar of Calimshan, known as Shangalar the Black, having been recorded in his personal spellbook."
