Revelation was a spell used to reveal hidden things. 
When cast, a burst of brilliant purple light covered an area around the caster. This purple light revealed the true state of creatures and objects in the affected area. It also revealed any hidden magical effects. If a creature traversed the affected area, any hidden items on their person were revealed. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a handful of dandelion seeds and other herbs with a total value of at least 50 gp.
