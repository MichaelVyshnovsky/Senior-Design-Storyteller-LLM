'''Antimineral shell''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that created a barrier of force that prevented all manner of elemental creatures and animated elements from entering the zone of effect.

==Effects==
The area protected by this spell was a 10 ft (3 m) radius hemisphere centered on the caster. The effect lasted over two hours at a minimum (longer for higher level casters). The invisible force field generated by this spell was impervious to animated stone and metals (such as armor or weapons), stone-based lifeforms such as [[galeb duhr]], [[xorn]], and [[xaren]], [[golem]]s and similar [[construct]]s, and creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. As an added bonus, it also prevented entrance of other creatures of elemental origin such as [[aerial servant]]s, [[djinn]], [[mephit]]s, and [[salamander]]s for example.

''Antimineral shell'' did not prevent entry of normal, non-animated stone or metal such as a thrown boulder or a rockslide. If the caster attempted to push the shell up against a warded creature in order to get it to move, the spell was soon broken.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a drop of an acidic compound, such as the caustic [[acid]] of a [[black dragon]].
