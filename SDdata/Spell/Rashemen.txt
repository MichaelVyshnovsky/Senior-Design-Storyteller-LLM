Rashemen (), also known as the Land of Berserkers, was a magocratic gynarchy in the Unapproachable East region of northeast Faerûn. It was a rugged and enigmatic land that could be considered nearly inhospitable by many folk. The native Rashemaar were a fierce and individualistic people that were renowned across the Realms for their great bravery and stunning power wielding the arcane arts.

The Rashemaar were quite superstitious, but also maintained a strong connection with the spirits of their land, particularly spirits of nature and house-spirits called domovoi.
The Dajemma (also spelled darjemma) was a type of coming-of-age tradition for young Rashemi men to travel to foreign lands to see and understand more of the world.
Vremyonni, male spellcasters, were traditionally hidden away from society at a young age to develop their magic in secrecy. This custom had fallen out of common practice by the time famed adventurer Minsc was born. He speculated that the practice may have originated either in response to a disaster caused by ancient male wizards, or to protect the boys from the attention of the goddess Mystra.
The smoky sjorl cheese originated in Rashemen, although foreigners often found it unpleasant. Other food commonly found in Rashemen included rabbit sausage, rothe cheese, and bread honeycake and scrump (a potent fermented cider) and boiled grains and berries for breakfast. A samovar of strong, bitter tea was used in ritual meetings.
While it did import some goods from abroad, Rashemen was entirely self-sufficient and did not require the import of any essentials from any nearby nations. It exported natural goods that could be found and processed in abundance including animal furs and wool, along with a few unique types of food and drink.
Rashemen had a strong tradition of berserker warriors, the most elite of which were organized into fangs or local lodges, such as the Black Bear, or the White Dragon lodge. The Wychlaran spellcasters supplemented the bands of fearsome warriors, wielding terrible and destructive magic to defend their nation whenever needed.
Rashemen was founded in  by the followers of Shemen, a chieftain of a Raumviran tribe, after his death.
Beginning in the 10 century DR and continuing on for centuries thereafter, Rashemen has repeatedly defended itself from multiple Thayan invasions.
During the Time of Troubles, in the , dead-magic zones sprung up around the land and the Wychlaran had trouble contacting the spirits. Some witches and artisans went mad and were slain some warriors also went mad, and it was thought they should also be slain. A few years later, Liriel Baenre utilized the Windwalker amulet to set free the spirits and the land to normal.
Years later, the Wychlaran fought a vicious civil war against the ruthless durthan witches, in the conflict known as the Witch War.
