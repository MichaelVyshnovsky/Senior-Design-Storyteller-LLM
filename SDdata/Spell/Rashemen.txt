'''Rashemen''' ({{Pronounce|rah|SHEH|men|refs=}}), also known as the '''Land of Berserkers''', was a [[Magocracy|magocratic]] [[Wikipedia:Matriarchy|gynarchy]] in the [[Unapproachable East]] region of [[northeast Faerûn]]. It was a rugged and enigmatic land that could be considered nearly inhospitable by many folk. The native [[Rashemaar]] were a fierce and individualistic people that were renowned across the Realms for their great bravery and stunning power wielding the [[arcane arts]].

{{Quote|To the north of [[Thay]] lies the cold beauty of Rashemen, land of [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserkers]]...Their land is a place both old and mysterious, harboring many strange spirits and magical places.|''The scribe [[Lhaeo]], in a letter to [[Alustriel Silverhand]].''}}

==Description==
[[File:Witch of rashemen.png|thumb|''A [[Wychlaran]] and her guards.''|420x420px]]
The northern lands of Rashemen were predominantly barren, ravaged by strong, harsh winds, while the south was cooler with a more placid environment that was considerably more hospitable for habitation. It was surrounded by numerous other mountain ranges along with vast lakes and rivers, all of which provided strong natural fortifications. These features made Rashemen an ideally defensible region against the forces of Thay to the south or the nearby great [[barbarian]] tribes. 

Rashemen was considered to be more closely connected to the [[Feywild]] than any other location in [[Faerûn]].{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3125}}

==Geography==
Rashemen was located just north of the [[Thayan Plateau]], between the [[Great Dale]] and [[Narfell]] to the west and the [[Sunrise Mountains]] to the east. The northern border of Rashemen lay at the base of the frigid [[Icerim Mountains]].

Rashemen claimed the western edge of the [[Hordelands]] between the [[Sunrise Mountains]] and [[Lake of Mists]], but had little real power in the region following the destruction of [[Citadel Rashemar]] in [[1360 DR]].

===Geographical Features=== 
;Bodies of Water:
*[[Falls of Erech]], the tremendous waterfall from the [[River Erech]] that marked Rashemen's northern border.
*[[Lake Ashane]], an icy body of water that was protected by various magical aquatic creatures.
*[[Lake Tirulag]], another frozen late that was rumored to be home to a [[ice dragon|dragon]] composed entirely of ice.
*[[River Ashan]], a minor river that sprung up within the Ashenwood from an underground waterway.
*[[River Rasha]], one of the most commercially important trade routes found in Rashemen.
*[[River Tir]], a wide and lazy river that allowed for sea travel to the country's eastern regions.
*[[River Fir]], a minor river that emptied into [[Lake Tirulag]].

;Forests:
*[[Ashenwood]], an ancient and unsettled forest that was home to great and powerful spirits.
*[[Erech Forest]], a  mysterious forest of dark spirits that housed the ruins of [[Citadel Tralkharn]]
*[[Urlingwood]], the magical "heart" of Rashemen, a favored of the enigmatic Wychlaran.

; Hills and Mountains:
*[[High Country (Rashemen)|High Country]], the wild and sparsely inhabited foothills on the western slopes of the Sunset Mountains.
*[[Running Rocks]], a range of solid [[granite]] peaks that housed many monstrous creatures such as [[troll]]s.

;Regions:
*[[Central Plains]], a stretch of picturesque farmland.
*[[Immil Vale]], a verdant valley that was said to be touched by the [[Mystra|Hidden One]] herself.
*[[North Country]], the serene yet harsh northern reaches of Rashemen that were dotted with centuries-old ruins.

==Government==
The nominal ruler of Rashemen was a mighty warrior-lord known as the ''huhrong'' or [[Iron Lord]], who was expected to rule with temperance and keep the nation safe with the aid of the [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserker lodges]]. The true power of the nation lay with the [[Wychlaran]], an all-female order of witches that wielded great and terrible magical powers. They appointed each and every Iron Lord and could replace the role whenever necessary. 

At the local level, each community or settlement was ruled over by a war leader known as a ''[[fyrra]]'', who exclusively controlled the armed forces under his command, and whose rule could be compared similarly to that of a mayor.

===Relationships===
Rashemen was at near-constant odds with the country of Thay. The [[Zulkir]]s and their fellow [[Red Wizard]]s tried to conquer the country and its magical wealth for around centuries.

==Society==
The Rashemaar renounced the advancing of civilization as was found in other lands across [[Faerûn]], preferring to hold on tight to what they referred to as the "warrior ideal."

Witches of the Wychlaran were treated with the greatest respect, as they were the leaders of communities and the nation. They were always given food and horses without question.

===Culture===
[[File:Rashemen side art.png|thumb|''The Rashemaar hunters.''|left|801x801px]]
The Rashemaar were quite superstitious, but also maintained a strong connection with the [[spirit]]s of their land, particularly spirits of nature and house-spirits called ''[[domovoi]]''.

The ''Dajemma'' (also spelled ''darjemma)'' was a type of coming-of-age tradition for young [[Rashemi]] men to travel to foreign lands to see and understand more of the world.

''[[Vremyonni]]'', male spellcasters, were traditionally hidden away from society at a young age to develop their magic in secrecy. This custom had fallen out of common practice by the time famed adventurer Minsc was born. He speculated that the practice may have originated either in response to a disaster caused by ancient male wizards, or to protect the boys from the attention of the goddess [[Mystra]].

===Food and Drink===
The smoky [[sjorl]] cheese originated in Rashemen, although foreigners often found it unpleasant. Other food commonly found in Rashemen included [[rabbit]] [[sausage]], [[rothe]] [[cheese]], and [[bread]]; honeycake and [[scrump]] (a potent fermented cider); and boiled grains and berries for breakfast. A samovar of strong, bitter tea was used in ritual meetings.

==Trade==
While it did import some goods from abroad, Rashemen was entirely self-sufficient and did not require the import of any essentials from any nearby nations. It exported natural goods that could be found and processed in abundance including animal furs and wool, along with a few unique types of food and drink.

==Defenses==
Rashemen had a strong tradition of [[Rashemaar berserker|berserker]] warriors, the most elite of which were organized into ''fangs'' or local lodges, such as the [[Black Bear Lodge|Black Bear]], or the [[White Dragon lodge]]. The Wychlaran spellcasters supplemented the bands of fearsome warriors, wielding terrible and destructive magic to defend their nation whenever needed.

==History==
{{Main|History of Rashemen}}
Rashemen was founded in {{Yearlink|-4963}} by the followers of [[Shemen]], a chieftain of a [[Raumviran]] tribe, after his death.

Beginning in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]] and continuing on for centuries thereafter, Rashemen has repeatedly defended itself from multiple Thayan invasions.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{yearlinkName|1358}}, [[dead-magic zone]]s sprung up around the land and the Wychlaran had trouble contacting the spirits. Some witches and artisans went mad and were slain; some warriors also went mad, and it was thought they should also be slain. A few years later, [[Liriel Baenre]] utilized the ''[[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]]'' amulet to set free the spirits and the land to normal.

Years later, the Wychlaran fought a vicious civil war against the ruthless [[durthan]] witches, in the conflict known as the [[Witch War of Rashemen|Witch War]].
