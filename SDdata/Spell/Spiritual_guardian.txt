Spiritual guardian is a spell that creates a translucent knight made of pure force within 5 (1.5m) of the caster. The holy warrior appears clad in heavy plate mail with the holy symbol of the casters deity embossed on its tunic and shield. The knight will fight by the side of the caster until it is let loose to fight on its own if so chosen.
