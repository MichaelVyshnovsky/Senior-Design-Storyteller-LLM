Wandering glyphs was a multi-school divine spell that created two glyphs that could be consciously moved, or would randomly wander, along a pre-determined set of surfaces.
The glyphs created by this spell had the same properties and powers as those conjured by the spell glyph of warding, the major difference being these were capable of movement.
While casting wandering glyphs, the priest would outline between two to six different surfaces with incense, and hence designate them as able to be traveled across. They all had to be within a one-mile radius of one another. When the casting was finished, and the caster created their glyphs they would be capable of travel along these surface types, taking either a path set by the caster, or completely random pathways.
This spell required the material components of incense, a drop of holy/unholy water for every selected surface, a black opal worth more than 250 gp and, if the surface area protected was greater than 50 square feet, powdered diamond with a minimum value of 1000 gp.
