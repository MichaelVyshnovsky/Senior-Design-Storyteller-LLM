        "mainbody": "Acid fog, also known as death fog,\nAcid fog could be cast by sorcerers and wizards, as well as clerics who commanded the Water domain.\nThe spell was similar in effect to a solid fog spell, but the mists it produced were also highly corrosive to any creature or item caught within it. The spell was able to damage the hull of a spelljammer.\nLike solid fog, a casting of acid fog required a mixture of a pinch of powdered hoof from some animal, and a pinch of powdered dried peas.\nThis spell was one of several that could be used in the crafting of acidic burst weapons.\nThis spell, together with the less powerful but similar stinking cloud, was invented by the Netherese arcanist Tolodine in , early in the history of Netheril."
