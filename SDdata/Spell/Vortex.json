        "Effects": "This spell created a ''vortex'' which was a swirling chaotic mass of pure energy barely controllable by the caster. A ''vortex'' stood {{SI|7|ft|long=yes}} tall with a diameter of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nOnce a ''vortex'' was created the caster needed to maintain concentration in order for it to remain. The caster could attempt to direct the movement of the ''vortex'', though half the time the ''vortex'' moved somewhere else. The ''vortex'' could easily pass through any object smaller than itself, but was redirect when contacting larger objects.\n\nAny non-magical creature touched by the ''vortex'' was injured, but magical creatures were harmed more because of the nature of the ''vortex''. There was a small chance that the ''vortex'' would violently explode in a wild surge each time it contacted a living creature.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a silk streamer and a handful of straw to cast."
