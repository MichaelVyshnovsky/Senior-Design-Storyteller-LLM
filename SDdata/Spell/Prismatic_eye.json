        "mainbody": "Prismatic eye was an alteration and evocation spell that caused a visible, directable orb, very much resembling a wizard eye, to appear over the shoulder of the caster. \nThe eye could be commanded by the caster to travel around and share its vision with them. At regular intervals,\nThe prismatic eye could be destroyed by normal, non-magical means.\nThe material components of this spell were a dried, or preserved, eyeball and a polished slice of abalone, oyster, or tortoise shell."
