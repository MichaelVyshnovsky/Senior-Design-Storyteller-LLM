The creature received the casters telepathic commands, as long as they were issued from within a range of  and followed them until their completion to the best of its ability. A tiny servant with no issued commands only fought in self-defense. Multiple creatures could be created at once by more experienced wizards, all of which could be commanded simultaneously.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
