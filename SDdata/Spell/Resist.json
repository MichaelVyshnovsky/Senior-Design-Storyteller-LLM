        "mainbody": "'''''Resist''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to strengthen a creature against the effects of cold, fatigue, heat and hunger. During the spell's duration, the creature was immune from damage caused by cold or heat, and damage from magical cold and heat spells was lessened. The spell invigorated a creature, giving them the same energy as if they received several hours of sleep. The feeling of hunger was suppressed.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a piece of rice cake or dumpling, a piece of cloth, a drop of water and a feather from a owl."
