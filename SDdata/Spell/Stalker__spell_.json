        "mainbody": "talker was a special divine conjuration quest spell from the creation, guardian, and plant spheres that essentially summoned a group of shambling mounds to serve the caster.\nWhen this spell was cast 3â€“7 plant creatures resembling shambling mounds were conjured to aid the caster. The conjured plant creatures would remain with the priest for a full week unless dismissed early. If summoned specifically for guard duty, the stalkers would stand guard for up to seven months provided their duties only included guarding a specific location.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind.\nThis spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power."
