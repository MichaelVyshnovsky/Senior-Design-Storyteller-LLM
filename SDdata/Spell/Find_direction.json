        "mainbody": "Find direction was a common divination spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell gave a ninja a temporary sense of direction, allowing them to find their position in relation to the cardinal points. For example, a lost ninja could cast this spell to find in what direction true north was. The spell functioned in all environments, such as underground. Lodestones did not have an affect on the spell.  \nThe spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures."
