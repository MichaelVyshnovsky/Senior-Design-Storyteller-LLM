Hand of Hoar, also called divine justice, was a divine albjuration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Hoar called Doombringers.
This spell punished someone who committed an act of cruelty upon another sentient creature. This spell would only end when it struck the target or the target died. During the casting the priest would touch the target and pronounce their injustice, triggering the spells magic. The exact effects of the hand of Hoar spell varied depending on the target, but the punishment always fit the crime.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small token once possessed by the one who committed the cruelty and the priests holy symbol to cast.
