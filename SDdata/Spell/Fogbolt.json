        "mainbody": "'''''Fogbolt''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell was used to temporarily blind a target creature. When cast, a thick vapor was released into the air. The vapor flew towards the targeted creature. The fog was so thick it was able to extinguish most flames, such as a [[torch]] or [[lantern]]. The targeted flame was unable to be relit for a short time afterwards. When surrounded by the fog, the targeted creature was unable to see and it also prevented some spells from being cast. If the targeted creature came into contact with another creature, the fog transferred to them. The fog was vulnerable to the environment: the duration of the fog was shortened if cast in a hot climate and strong winds, and wind-based spells, could dissipate the fog. If cast in a desert, the fog transformed into steam before vanishing. This spell did not function on phaerimm.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a drop of water. During casting, the drop of water had to fall onto smoke generated from any source."
