        "mainbody": "Portrait was a basic alteration spell used to capture a scene perfectly within another item. This spell was created by the famed wizard Darsson Spellmaker.\nWith this spell the caster was able to transfer an exact image of a specific scene into a sphere of crystal or glass. The size of the captured area depended on the skill of the caster, with extremely skilled wizards being able to capture an area of up to 1,000 ft. (305 m) in diameter.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small sphere of glass or crystal to cast.\nThis spell was developed at the behest of Jantz and Joli Thozzil, the owners and proprietors of the traveling business Portrait Balls."
