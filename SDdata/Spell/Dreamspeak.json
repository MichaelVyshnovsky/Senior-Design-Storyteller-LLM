        "Effects": "When a creature was affected by ''dreamspeak'', they would continuously babble in every language in which they were fluent, speaking about all manner of random and disconnected subjects. They would crack jokes and share dreams they had had, heartfelt opinions, stories about their lives and, quite possibly, sensitive information they would not normally release to others such as pass phrases, [[command word]]s, or other such secrets. The only information that would never be revealed in this manner was another being's [[true name]].\n\nIt was impossible to converse or pose questions to someone under the effects of ''dreamspeak'', as their communication was purely one-way.",
        "Casting": "If the affected creature was awakened during the duration of ''dreamspeak'', the spell was immediately broken.\n\nThe spell had [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material]] components involved in its casting. The material component for this spell was a small, [[brass]] or [[silver]] [[bell]] that was consumed in the process."
