'''''Ghosttalk''''' was a [[spell]] that allowed a [[wizard]] and a target to remain in earshot no matter what.

==Effects==
After casting the spell on a target, all sounds that generated from the caster's person (but not from implements they were wielding, or their surroundings) were repeated in the target's ear, and viceversa, for five minutes. Distance was no longer a factor, nor was background noise; the two could hear each other no matter what.

A second casting allowed for five more minutes, but third castings did not work.

==Components==
Just [[somatic]] components were required.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
