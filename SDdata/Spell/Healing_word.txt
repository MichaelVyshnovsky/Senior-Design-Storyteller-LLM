Healing word was a healing spell or prayer cast by bards, clerics, and druids. Among the most basic forms of magical healing, healing word uses some of one creatures life force to heal said creature a small amount. This creature must be within a nearby area of twenty-five feet in diameter or the caster themselves. As a cleric grows in power and skill, the power of healing word increases, to as much as six times its initial utility. Healing word is fairly basic in casting and can be cast twice without the need for a short rest, though it requires a short "cool off" time of several seconds before it can be recast.
