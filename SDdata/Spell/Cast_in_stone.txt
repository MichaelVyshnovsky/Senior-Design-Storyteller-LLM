Cast in stone was a powerful spell used by druids.
When the spell was in effect, any creature within  who met the eyes of the caster was permanently transformed into a statue. During casting, the caster selected a word of command, with which they were able to reverse the spell and release a creature.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
