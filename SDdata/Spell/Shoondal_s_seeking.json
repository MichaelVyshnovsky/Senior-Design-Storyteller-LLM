        "mainbody": "Shoondals seeking was a divination wizard spell.\nThis spell allowed the caster to visualize every key, lock, or other fastening device within . Such items glowed bright gold to the casters eyes even if concealed by materials up to  thick. The caster was able to see these items through magical disguises.\nAny enchanted locks or keys glowed red to the caster and traps or alarms glowed blue. If one of these items was both enchanted and trapped, then the red glow would overshadow the blue, thus hiding the trap from the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a key to cast. The key was consumed during the casting."
