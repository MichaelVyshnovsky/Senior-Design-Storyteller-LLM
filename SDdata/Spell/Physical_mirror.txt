'''''Physical mirror''''' was a common spell used by [[cleric]]s.

==Effects==
This spell functioned by folding local space into an invisible disk that could be up to {{SI|20|ft}} wide. The disk provided a powerful defensive shield, as any missile or spell it intercepted was sent back along its course. It was unidirectional, so the caster could send their own missiles or spells through it. During casting, the caster had to determine both the location and orientation of the disk. Once cast, the disk could not be moved. If two ''physical mirror'' disks come into contact with each other, a violent reaction occurred and both instantaneously vanished. It senr a destructive wave through space and time and any creature within {{SI|35|yd}}, including  the caster, were at risk.

A caster was unable to use this spell within the [[phlogiston]].

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a small [[mirror]] made from finished [[platinum]], which had to have a value of at least 500 [[gp]].
