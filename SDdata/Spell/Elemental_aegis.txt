'''''Elemental aegis''''' was a [[spell]] of the [[abjuration|abjuration school]] used by some [[swordmage]]s, particularly those with an elemental focus.

==Description==
When a mage cast ''elemental aegis'', they were able to extended their [[mythal]] to protect another. The target had to be within 25 feet (7.6 meters) in radius. The swordmage then infused the [[magic]]al shield with elemental energy, protecting the creature within it from either acid, electric, fire, cold, or sonic damage. 

This spell was similar to the ''[[fear no elements]]'' spell, in that the degree of protection provided was proportional to the caster's vitality. Unlike, the former, however, ''elemental aegis'' was easily recast after a short rest of a few minutes or more.{{Cite dragon/367/Class Acts: Primordial Paths|56}}
