Elemental aegis was a spell of the abjuration school used by some swordmages, particularly those with an elemental focus.
When a mage cast elemental aegis, they were able to extended their mythal to protect another. The target had to be within 25 feet (7.6 meters) in radius. The swordmage then infused the magical shield with elemental energy, protecting the creature within it from either acid, electric, fire, cold, or sonic damage. 
This spell was similar to the fear no elements spell, in that the degree of protection provided was proportional to the casters vitality. Unlike, the former, however, elemental aegis was easily recast after a short rest of a few minutes or more.
