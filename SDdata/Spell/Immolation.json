        "mainbody": "'''''Immolation''''' was a cruel [[evocation]] [[spell]] that consumed a creature in flames for a long period of time.",
        "Effects": "The spell targeted a creature within a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. If unable to dodge the effect, the creature was immediately enveloped by bright, magical [[fire|flames]] that could not be quenched by any non-magical means. The fire continued to burn for as long as 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating, or until the victim managed to successfully evade the flames. A creature killed by this spell was completely turned to ashes, leaving no body behind.",
        "Components": "The spell only required [[verbal component]]s.",
        "History": "''Immolation'' was favored by some members of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
