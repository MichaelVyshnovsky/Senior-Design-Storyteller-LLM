        "mainbody": "An alchemist was a craft profession.  At the most basic level, anyone who mixed substances together in a liquid form to create a wanted effect could be considered an alchemist. Alchemy required a fair amount of intelligence, as well as time and materials.  It could also be a very expensive pursuit. \nAn alchemist could craft mundane substances, such as oil, soap, perfume, antitoxin, acid, alchemists fire, sunrods, tanglefoot bags, and thunderstones, and other things such as the special brews that were used in the process of creating a dracolich. In the days of ancient Netheril, an entire school was dedicated to the study of alchemy. Scholars there were able to turn lead into gold, turn air into poisonous gas, make water explosive, and shape elemental fire.\nNot all alchemists were spellcasters, but many were, as spellcasting ability was needed to make magical potions. Dedicated practitioners could become master alchemists.\nOf all the races, gnomes were best known across the Realms as alchemists.\nIn addition to a clear space and workbench, a fully-stocked alchemical laboratory required many tools and implements, costing on average between 200-1000 gp.\nThe preparation of substances used tools like the common measuring cup and spoon, mortar and pestle, or quern. and separation of materials could be done with a centrifuge, on a funnel. A file was useful for taking small slivers off a solid chunk of material.\nFor storing supplies and finished products, alchemists used containers like bottles, flasks, jugs, and vials Preservation of non-stable ingredients could be helped with a cold ice chest filled with blocks of ice.\nTimekeeping for processes could be tracked with a minute or hourglass or large water clock. When taking quick notes, an alchemist could use an easel, drawing slate and chalk, or a handy papyrus pad. The examination of their work could require the use of various lens, concave and convex, to get a clearer view.\nWhen actively mixing and heating they used dishes, retorts, crucibles, while simple string had any number of uses holding things together.\nFor heating, some sort of fireplace or furnace was needed, with coal serving as an ideal fuel. The brazier was a common choice, while candles were used for smaller applications. Ovens and kilns provided large-scale, steady and high temperatures, making them a vital but bulky addition to a workspace. Bellows fed air into the flame to intensify the heat, while a vent could be used to safely evacuate dangerous gases from a chamber.\nFor handling their work, hazardous or otherwise, an alchemist was advised to use tongs, tweezers, heat mats, and magnets depending on the situation. They could also wear sturdy gloves and an apron to protect themselves further. Cleaning up could be made far easier with sponges, a washing basin and a water reservoir.\n* Almaestaddamir Auldcastle ran an alchemist shop in Ashabenford.\n* Amelior Amanitas alchemist and sage from Secomber.\n* Angrath Dree owner of Old Angraths Smokehouse in Red Larch.\n* Askrim \"the Bold\" of Neverwinter, co-author of The Making of a Homunculus.\n* Cordwainer a member of the Ministry of Art in Ravens Bluff.\n* Grollar Zarmshield of Tulmene.
