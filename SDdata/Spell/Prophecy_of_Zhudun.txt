'''''Prophecy of Zhudun''''' was an [[invocation]] used by [[warlock]]s of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], particularly those with the [[Warlock#Star Pact Warlock|star pact]].

==Effects==
With this invocation, the warlock whispered fragments of prophecy seen in the blank face of the dead star [[Zhudun]], and a creature of their choosing suffered a nightmarish vision. Distracted, they became dazed and unable to see foes if they lacked the willpower to resist it.
