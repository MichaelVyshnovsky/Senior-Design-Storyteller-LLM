'''''Spell thrust''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that stripped all [[magic]]al protections that were imbued by spells as powerful as ''[[minor spell turning]]'', or those less powerful.

==Effects==
''Spell thrust'' could only be cast upon a single target, from up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) away. That target instantly had their minor to moderate spell protections stripped, such as those granted from ''minor spell turning'', ''[[spell immunity]]'', and several others of the same power or lower.

Creatures with any degree of magic resistance would find that it did not help against this spell.
