Spell thrust was an arcane abjuration spell that stripped all magical protections that were imbued by spells as powerful as minor spell turning, or those less powerful.
Spell thrust could only be cast upon a single target, from up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) away. That target instantly had their minor to moderate spell protections stripped, such as those granted from minor spell turning, spell immunity, and several others of the same power or lower.
Creatures with any degree of magic resistance would find that it did not help against this spell.
