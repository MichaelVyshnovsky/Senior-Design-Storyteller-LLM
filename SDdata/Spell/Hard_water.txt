'''''Hard water''''' was a [[spell]] that manipulated the state of water.
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell transformed a body of water, or a section, into a substance that was hard as a rock. The amount of water that could be transformed was {{SI|10|cu ft|long=yes}}, or about {{SI|75|gal|long=yes}}. The caster could determine the depth of the affected water, with a minimum depth of at least {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}}. The water retained its color. Enchanted and magical water was unaffected by this spell, as was both [[holy water|holy]] and [[unholy water]].

Any creature within the water at the time of casting was unharmed. They were held in place until the spell expired or the caster cancelled the spell. ''Hard water'' was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a flask filled with water and a single stone.
