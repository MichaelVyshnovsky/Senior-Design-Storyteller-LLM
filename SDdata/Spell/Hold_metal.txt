Hold metal was an enchantment spell that caused any ferrous-metal items to immediately hold still within a specified area.
When this spell was cast, every metal item was held perfectly still as if it was bound by sovereign glue. Any weapons that were being swung were stopped in mid-air and any affected suits of armor kept their wearers in place as if they were affected by hold person.
For the duration of the spell, these metal objects could not be moved by non-magical means and any items entering the spells area-of-effect were similarly held in place. The size of the spells effects, along with its duration, were dependent on the skill and experience of the caster.
