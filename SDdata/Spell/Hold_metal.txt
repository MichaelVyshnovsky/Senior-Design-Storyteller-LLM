'''''Hold metal''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that caused any ferrous-metal items to immediately hold still within a specified area.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, every metal item was held perfectly still as if it was bound by ''[[sovereign glue]]''. Any [[weapon]]s that were being swung were stopped in mid-air and any affected suits of [[armor]] kept their wearers in place as if they were affected by ''[[hold person]]''.

For the duration of the spell, these metal objects could not be moved by non-magical means and any items entering the spell's area-of-effect were similarly held in place. The size of the spell's effects, along with its duration, were dependent on the skill and experience of the caster.
