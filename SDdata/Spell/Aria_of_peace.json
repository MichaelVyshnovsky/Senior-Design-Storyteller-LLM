        "mainbody": "Aria of peace was a powerful enchantment spell used to stop hostile interactions.\nThis spell created soothing melodies of different instruments within the area of effect around the caster. Listeners who were charmed by these sounds ceased all violent activities. The tunes could be kept up by the caster through concentration and then lasted some time longer, giving the caster the chance to settle the situation with more permanent means.\nThis spell required verbal components only.\nAria of peace was the most powerful of the \"magics of sight and sound\" collected by Faer√ªnian master bard Morion in his special spellbook. It saw widespread use within Zakhara, but had a different name there. Possibly the spell was invented in the Land of Fate.\nAria of peace was generally eschewed by evil spellcasters due to its nature."
