        "mainbody": "Zajimarns ice claw prison was an evocation spell used by wizards and sorcerers and by clerics with the Cold domain. This spell was created by Zajimarn.\nThis spell created a large reptilian icy claw that could be used to grasp at targets. Any creature grabbed by the claw would by physically harmed by both the extreme cold of the claw and by any crushing action.\nThe icy claw prison was immune to most magical effects that did not cause harm. Also, it could push through a wall of force or similar magical barriers. The claw was immune to cold-based attacks but was susceptible to fire or heat. It could be destroyed by a disintegrate or dispel magic spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a white leather glove and a piece of clear rock crystal to cast."
