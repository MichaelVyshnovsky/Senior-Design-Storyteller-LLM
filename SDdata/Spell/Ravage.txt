'''''Ravage''''' was a [[divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that conjured forth a column of vile energy that rendered the spirit and body of any people or creatures caught within.

==Effects==
The swirling, black energy that was created by this spell encompassed an area 10' (3 m) in radius and 40' (12.2 m) in height. Any living beings caught within received significant wounds that affected both their body and soul. These injuries could only be healed by [[magic]] cast within an area that had been ''[[consecrate]]d'' or was otherwise considered ''[[hallow]]ed'' ground.

Those who possessed a heroic resilience were able to resists this damage outright.

==Casting==
The casting of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as the use of a ''[[divine focus]]''.
