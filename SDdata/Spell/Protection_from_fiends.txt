Protection from fiends was an arcane and divine spell that functioned similarly to protection from evil, 10 radius, but specifically protected its users against fiends.
Upon a creature touched by the caster a  magical circle would be created. This magical circle was mobile, moving with the creature it was cast upon, and allowed the creatures within its confines to launch attacks at those outside of it. This magical circle protected against fiends, tieflings, or anything else from the Lower Planes, such as gehreleths, night hags, yugoloths, and more. It was impossible for them to enter this magical circle, attack those within, nor dispel the magical circle by any means. The circle remained active anywhere from five to forty minutes.
Casting this spell upon a trapped fiend would cancel out its effect, causing it to end immediately.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component in the form of required a powder containing a substance harmful to the types of fiends meant to be warded against. This meant something like iron in the case of tanarri or silver in the case of baatezu. This powder would be scattered in a circle around the spellcasters target.
