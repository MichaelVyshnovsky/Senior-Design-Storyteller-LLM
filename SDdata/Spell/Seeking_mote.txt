'''''Seeking mote''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured a bolt of light that streaked towards a target.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the ''mote'' appeared from the caster's body and streaked towards a targeted person or creature. If the ''mote'' wasn't destroyed or ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' en route to its target, it struck them and inflicted damage.

==History==
The specifications of ''seeking mote'' were inscribed upon one of the "inner petals" of the [[Chauntea]]n [[relic]], the ''[[Glarathra]]''.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and two [[material component]]s: a bit of dust and a speck of translucent [[gemstone]], both of which had to be exposed to direct sunlight.
