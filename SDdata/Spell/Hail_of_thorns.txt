Hail of thorns was a spell used by rangers.
A caster used this spell with a ranged weapon. After casting, the ammunition from the ranged weapon, such as an arrow, became infused with magical energy by the spell. When launched, a spray of sharp thorns erupted from the missile, which rained down upon a target area.
This spell required only a verbal component.
