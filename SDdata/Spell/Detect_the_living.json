        "mainbody": "Detect the living was a common spell used by ninjas. It was very rarely found outside Kara-Tur.\nWhile similar to detect undead, a ninja used this spell to identify the presence of living creatures. During casting, the ninja was required to remain motionless. The spell revealed the presence of living creatures with a faint glow that was only visible to the ninja, along a path 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 60 feet (18 meters) long. \nThe spell only showed the direction of a living creature, and did not reveal the species or alignment. The spell was able to penetrate walls, but certain barriers would block the spell, such as a thin layer of metal, solid stone, walls of loose earth, or thick wood. The spell was unable to detect the presence of small animals or plants.\nThe spell required only kuji-kiri hand gestures as the somatic component."
