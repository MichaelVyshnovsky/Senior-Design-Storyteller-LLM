'''''Wyrm''''' was a destructive type of [[giant]] rune that allowed its wielder to decay objects.

==Effects==
Any object inscribed with the ''wyrm'' rune would deteriorate over the course of one to ten days. This would cause wood to warp, metal to rust, and food to rot. However, this rune could not effect plants or [[animal]]s.

The only known ways to remove the effect of this rune were the [[spell]]s ''[[remove curse]]'' and ''[[dispel magic]]''.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Healing (rune)|healing]]''. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours. Due to limitations in its energy patterns, the rune could only be inscribed upon small objects.

==History==
The ''wyrm'' rune's name was derived from the fact that, in giant legends, dragons were often seen as synonymous with destruction and decay.
