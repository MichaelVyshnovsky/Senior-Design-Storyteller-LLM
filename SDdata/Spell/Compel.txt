'''''Compel''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Torm]], enabling them to command several creatures with a single word.

==Effects==
For the spell to function the targets needed to understand the language used during casting, and the caster needed to be able to see them. The targets would obey the command to the best of their ability provided the instructions given were clear and concise. ''Compel'' had no effect on [[undead]]. The effects of this spell lasted for two minutes, and the caster could utter a second command at the start of the second minute if they desired.

Torm quickly punished anyone who used this spell to render a foe helpless so they could be slain. He would assault them with a powerful ''[[flame strike]]'' and strip them of all divine powers before casting them out of the faith.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to cast.
