'''''Clone''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that created a [[clone]] of a [[human]], [[demihuman]], or [[humanoid]] creature. Following the [[Spellplague]] it became a [[ritual]], but after the [[Second Sundering]] it returned to being a necromantic spell.

{{Quote|As you intone the incantation, the bit of flesh you placed inside the alchemical bath twitches and writhes as the magical power takes effect. From the flesh, hairlike threads emerge, slowly forming the shape of the creature you intend to duplicate. In a matter of months, this bit of tissue will transform into a new body.}}

==Effect==
The ''clone'' spell effectively created an exact duplicate of a human, demihuman, or humanoid in mind and body from a chunk of their flesh, taking around 2 to 8 months to fully mature. This process could be done regardless of whether the original creature was still alive or had died in the interceding time. This duplicate possessed all the same memories, personality traits, and abilities they had at the time at which the chunk of flesh was taken, though obviously lacked any of their possessions and [[soul]]. Any memories, knowledge, or abilities that the original creature obtained afterwards would not be present.

Originally this spell was designed as such that the duplicate was active at the same time as the original creature. Both would be inherently aware of the other's existence and desire their respective destruction. If they could not accomplish this, either the clone or original creature were likely to go insane and kill themselves, though the majority of the time it was the clone that this occurred to.

Later iterations of the spell in the lateâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] reworked the functionality of the spell entirely. Instead of having the clone be active at the same time, the clone was a lifeless vessel that remained inert until the original creature's soul (if willing) could inhabit it. Until then the clone needed to be preserved within a special vessel to prevent it from rotting. The transference of soul would occur immediately upon the original creature's death, though if the original creature was already dead, then their soul would immediately transfer to the clone upon its reaching full maturity. If the original creature had died from natural causes, soul transference would not occur. Once the transfer occurred the original's remains would become inert, unable to be [[raise dead|raised from the dead]] or [[resurrection|resurrected]] by any means.

After the Second Sundering the ''clone'' spell changed further. Clones took only 120 days to mature and casters found that they were capable of creating clones that looked like the original creature when it was younger.

==Components==
In addition to [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, casting ''clone'' required [[material component]]s. Over the years some of the material components varied, but a key component was always a chunk of flesh from the creature to be cloned. This chunk of flesh usually had to be of a volume of {{SI|1|cubic inch}} and didn't need to be fresh for the spell to work. Other parts of a creature, such as its hair or nails, could not be substituted.

Later iterations of the spell required a specially prepared, appropriately sized vessel for the clone to be housed within as they developed and to keep them preserved until needed,In 1{{st}} and 2{{nd}} edition the spell was accompanied in the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' by a note stating that, if the DM so desired, the spell might require that "...some means of storing and preserving the sample must be devised and maintained." In later editions this was codified with the requirement of a vessel. which could be considered a necessary [[spell focus]]. The cost of an appropriate vessel could range from 500 [[gold piece]]s to as much as 2000 or 5000 gp. This vessel could be anything, ranging from a [[crystal]] container filled with seawater, to a [[coffin]], a huge urn, or even a mud-filled cyst in the ground. Regardless of what form the vessel took, it had to be filled with an [[alchemical]] solution, though one could substitute [[residuum]].

The ritual version of ''clone'' specifically required the vessel to be made of crystal and for seawater to be poured into the vessel, then mixed with the alchemical solution for a period of 1 hour. The Second Sundering version of ''clone'' additionally required a [[diamond]] that was worth at least 1000 gp.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Dethed]] in {{Yearlink|-1897}} and was originally known as ''Dethed's clone''.

Sometime after the {{YearlinkName|309}}, [[Halaster Blackcloak]] used ''clone'' to fake his own death (for the first time). He infected the clone with [[leprosy]] and left it to die where patrols from [[Waterdeep]] would discover it.
