'''''Mist of Eldath''''' was an [[Eldathyn]] [[spell]] from the lawful [[evocation]] school of magic, used by [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the ''mist of Eldath'' spell blanketed an area of {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} radius in sight of the caster with a green-blue haze. All creatures within the mist were immediately cured of all [[disease]]s or [[poison]]s and had their wounds closed and healed by Eldathyn magics. The ''mist of Eldath'' remained in place for six seconds and dissipated afterward.
