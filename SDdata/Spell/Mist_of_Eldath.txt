Mist of Eldath was an Eldathyn spell from the lawful evocation school of magic, used by druids.
When cast, the mist of Eldath spell blanketed an area of  radius in sight of the caster with a green-blue haze. All creatures within the mist were immediately cured of all diseases or poisons and had their wounds closed and healed by Eldathyn magics. The mist of Eldath remained in place for six seconds and dissipated afterward.
