'''''Genesis''''' was an extremely powerful spell that created [[demiplanes]].

==Effects==
The spell had to be cast in the [[ethereal plane]]. It immediately created a {{SI|1|foot|c|long=yes}} radius [[demiplane]], which grew in radius to {{SI|180|feet|long=yes}} over the course of about half a year, adding its initial radius every day. Repeated castings allowed the demiplane to continue growing by about {{SI|180|feet|long=yes}} of radius per casting, at the same rate as its initial creation.

The spell only created barren, lifeless demiplanes; life had to be added by other means. All that was created was land, atmosphere, water, and temperature.

==Components==
The spell called for [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, but also needed a significant fraction of the caster's lifeforce. The material component was a crystalline sphere.
