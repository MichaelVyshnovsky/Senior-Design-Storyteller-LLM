'''''Battletide''''' was a [[divine]] [[spell]] wielded by [[cleric]]s of [[Bane]] and [[Iyachtu Xvim]] that allowed a caster to sap the energy from nearby beings and transfer it to him- or herself

==Effects==
Any lifeforms near to the caster, at a radius of at least {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}, would be slowed
in their actions, feeling extremely lethargic. If any creatures or people who were hostile to the caster were within this area of effect, then the caster would be able to act with increased swiftness like under a ''[[haste]]'' spell without suffering the detrimental effect of that one.

The effects of ''battletide'' could be negated by an ''[[antimagic field]]'' or a successful casting of ''[[dispel magic]]''. Furthermore, resisting this spell became easier with time as this spell wore off.

==Components==
''Battletide'' required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and a [[divine focus]]. Older versions of this spell required [[material component]]s in the form of a piece of cobweb, [[human]] hair, or [[silk]] thread as long as the caster's hand.
