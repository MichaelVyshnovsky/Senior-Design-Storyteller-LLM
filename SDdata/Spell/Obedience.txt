Obedience was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A wu jen used this spell to force any creature into total obedience. The spell worked best on sentient creatures. During casting, the wu jen had to come into physical contact with the target creature and place a circlet made of gold on their head. Once the circlet was in place, it could not be removed by anyone except the wu jen. The spell had no affect on the personality of the target creature. When a creature under this spell tried to disobey or harm the wu jen, the caster was able to punish the creature with immense pain until the creature acquiesced. The spell had no maximum range and did not expire until the circlet was removed or the creature died. Spells such as dispel magic, limited wish and wish could be cast to remove the circlet from the creature. Very rarely, a deity would take pity on a creature and lift the spell.  
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a circlet made of gold valued at least 1,000 gp.
