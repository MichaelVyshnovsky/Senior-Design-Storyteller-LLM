        "mainbody": "Heal self was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, this powerful spell fully healed the caster. Broken bones and damaged organs were fully restored. The spell also healed illnesses, parasitic infestations, and conditions such as lycanthropy and mummy rot.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required several material components a single drop of the casters blood, two drops of water, and a gemstone worth at least 100 gp. During casting, the caster placed the material components in their hand and slapped them to their body.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimm of Myth Drannor."
