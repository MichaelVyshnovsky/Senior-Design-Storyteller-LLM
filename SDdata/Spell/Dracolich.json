        "History": "The process of becoming a dracolich was discovered by [[Sammaster|Sammaster the Mad]], a fallen [[Chosen of Mystra]], who was inspired after re-translating ''[[The Chronicle of Years to Come]]'' by the prophet [[Maglas]]. He was convinced that [[Toril]] would suffer a great apocalypse and \"naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers. But the dead dragons shall rule the world entire&hellip;\" Sammaster's first success was with the great red [[wyrm]] [[Shargrailar|Shargrailar the Dark]] in the {{YearlinkName|902}}. Since then, Sammaster and his followers, the [[Cult of the Dragon]], created many more, preparing for the apocalypse they \"knew\" would come.\"\n\nAfter his destruction in the {{YearlinkName|916}}, Sammaster somehow resurrected himself on the far-off world of [[Adenthia]], where he hoped to use necromancy and chaos power, a local form of magic, to achieve a chaotic state between life and death without the need for a phylactery for himself and his newly created dracoliches. Sammaster acquired the assistance of a local cult, Penultima, which he turned into a kind of Cult of the Dragon cell. However, their new dracoliches were weakened and prone to madness, rage, and spontaneous disintegration. [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] sent [[Elminster]] to Adenthia to investigate the \"diminished\" dracoliches terrorizing its southern lands; Elminster suspected that world's chaos power was infecting her own magic. Elminster enlisted the aid of a local adventurer, [[Gerana]], and they tracked the dracoliches to the cult's fortress, where they destroyed Sammaster again and ended the threat of dracoliches on Adenthia.",
