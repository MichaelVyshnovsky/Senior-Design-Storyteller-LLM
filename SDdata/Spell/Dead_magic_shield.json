        "mainbody": "'''''Dead magic shield''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Shaundakul]], enabling them to create a shield of force.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a {{SI|2|ft|c}} diameter shield of force attached to one of the caster's forearms. The ''dead magic shield'' could be used to block incoming magical attacks if the caster was not wielding a two-handed weapon, casting another spell, or carrying a regular [[shield]]. The shield would still function if the priest was wielding a weapon in their other hand.\n\nThe ''dead magic shield'' would dissipate any incoming magic directed at the caster. The shield had no effect against physical attacks.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
