'''Conjure woodland beings''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that summoned [[fey]] creatures.

==Effect==
Casting this spell, the caster could choose to summon up to four fey creatures. The spell's power would be divided among the summoned creatures so the more fey creatures there were, the less powerful they would be. The summoned creatures were friendly to the caster and their allies and followed orders. They would last for a hour.

If the creatures "died" or the hour was up, then the creature or creatures would simply disappear. If the spell was cast at specific higher spell level, then the number of summoned creatures could double or even triple but not decrease in strength with numbers.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, a [[material component]] in the form of one [[holly]] berry per creature being conjured, were necessary for the casting of this spell.
