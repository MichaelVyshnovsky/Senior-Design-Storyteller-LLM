        "mainbody": "'''''Skull eyes''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell available only to [[cleric]]s of [[Cyric]], the Prince of Lies. It was similar to the ''[[eyebite]]'' spell except it ''[[Charm|charmed]]'' or ''[[confusion|confused]]'' its targets.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to perform gaze attacks on three or more victims, one at a time. The intended targets had to be alive (not [[undead]]), in sight, and within 45 ft (14 m). More experienced casters could extend the range and duration, allowing more time to attack more targets. Each victim got a chance to resist the magic of this spell and, if successful, suffer no ill effects.\n\nThe caster could choose between a ''charm'' effect, very similar to the ''[[charm monster]]'' spell, or a ''[[confusion]]'' effect for each victim in turn, until the spell duration expired or until no more targets were available, whichever came first.\n\nAs a harmless but dramatic side-effect of this spell, the caster's eyes turned jet black with irises shaped like skulls.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell."
