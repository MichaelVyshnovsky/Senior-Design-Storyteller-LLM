        "mainbody": "Weave mythal was a spell that was commonly used in Myth Drannor and Netheril.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the magic of the caster or a targeted creature to be immune to the influence of a mythal. It also prevented power fluctuations, augmentations, and influence from wild magic. This spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.\nThe older version of this spell, used by arcanists in Netheril, had a different effect. This spell created an impenetrable sphere around an area. To gain access through the sphere, an individual required an activation key. The spheres barrier prevented any living creatures, constructs, and undead from crossing the perimeter. The caster was able to attach an additional spell to the mythal, which activated if a creature tried to cross the spheres barrier without the proper activation key. The width of the sphere was , which increased based on the casters skill level.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components. The spell used by arcanists required verbal and material components.\nThe spell was invented in  by Netherese arcanist Lefeber. It was thus known in Netheril as Lefebers weave mythal."
