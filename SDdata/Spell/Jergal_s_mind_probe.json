        "mainbody": "Jergals mind probe was a divine necromancy and divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Jergal called Doomscribes.\nThis bizarre spell combined the ESP spell with the paralyze spell, allowing the caster to attack a single target by touching them. The target would be paralyzed for several minutes, allowing the priest to probe every corner of their mind for information regarding the targets faith, adherence to that faith, how they dealt with their strengths and weaknesses, and their biggest failures and accomplishments. The spell would end if the priest attempted to cast another spell or stopped concentration on probing the targets mind. The casting of this spell was viewed as a violation significant enough for the victim to develop a strong hatred for the caster.\nThis spell had no effect upon creatures immune to paralysis, mindless creatures such as some undead and golems, and nonintelligent creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol to cast."
