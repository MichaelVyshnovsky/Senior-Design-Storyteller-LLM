'''''Filverel's doorward''''' was a [[spell]] developed by [[Filverel Donnathlascen]]. It was a [[combination spell]], which melded ''[[wizard lock]]'' with ''[[magic missile]]''.

==Effects==
The spell affected one doorway, hatch, or other entryway protected by some covering, and it affected all coverings on that doorway. When anyone touched the doorway, the spell unleashed a ''magic missile'' at them. The guarded surface could do this only once a minute, and was discharged after two such attacks. It did not attack nonliving creatures, nor those protected against spells. ''[[dispel magic]]'' was effective at breaking this spell; an untriggered ''doorward'' could easily endure for centuries.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]] components and [[somatic]] components, as well as a very complex series of [[material component]]s. It required a drop or three of the caster's saliva, and a pinch of dust that had once settled on a [[potion]] or some surface that was bearing an active ''[[symbol]]'' or ''[[glyph]]'' spell at the time. More importantly, and in a manner unique to this spell, it could only be cast by a mage who was already familiar with ''magic missile'' and ''wizard lock''.

==History==
The spell was developed by [[Filverel Donnathlascen]].
