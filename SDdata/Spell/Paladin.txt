A paladin was a holy crusader, sworn to an oath to promote and fight for their beliefs and values. As paragons of their beliefs, paladins were granted the ability to wield divine magic by deities or similar powers. So long as a paladin stayed true to their oath, they retained the ability to wield these powers. The life of a paladin more commonly attracted good persons to it than those with malice in their heart, but evil paladins were not unheard of.

The defining characteristic of a paladin was their oath, which most frequently called upon a paladin to battle the forces of evil and to defend justice wherever they could. Precisely how a paladin defined these values differed from one paladin to another and some swore their oath as a form of religious devotion, dedicating themselves to the values of a particular god. Others, however, simply held themselves to a particularly powerful sense of right and wrong, which was in of itself enough to attract the favor of the divine. Evil paladins sometimes served as champions of primordials or fiends, committing atrocities like the sacrifice of sapients in exchange for unholy power. All paladins, regardless of whom they served and how they acted, were expected to serve as sworn defenders of their beliefs, smiting those who would debase or devalue them.
Lawful or good individuals were more likely to feel the call to serve as a paladin than others, making most paladins lawful good. As a result, most commoners viewed the paladin to be, by default, lawful good, though this was not necessarily true. Paladins who did worship good or lawful gods tended towards the worship of deities such as Azuth, Bahamut, Chauntea or her aspect Yondalla, Helm, Ilmater, Kelemvor, Mystra, Jergal, Lathander, Moradin, Re-Horakhty, Sune, Torm, or Tyr. All paladins adhered to a code of conduct of some sort,, though the strictures of their oath often differed significantly from one paladin to another. It was from this code that paladins derived their nature as the purist champions of whatever cause they served.

Few paladins truly "chose" their career and for many becoming a paladin was more like answering a call to destiny, sometimes quite literally from a god or angel. A rare few felt compelled to the paladins path since their early youth, as though sent into the world with a divine purpose. It was often said that becoming a paladin was something that was either within ones nature or not and though an individual could reject the divine call that beckoned them, no one could become a paladin who did not have the necessary conviction. Most people who did feel the compulsion to become a paladin began their training early in life, often as adolescents. Many were squires or assistants to more experienced paladins, training for years before they came into their own as champions of their cause. Others heard or answered the call only late in life, after having pursued a different career, possibly in response to a terrible catastrophe like the destruction of their home.
The adventuring lifestyle came easily to most paladins, regardless of their origin. Although exceedingly rare among the general populace, paladins were disproportionately likely to pursue a life of adventure compared to most other warriors. Once a paladin swore their oath their loyalty to their was second to none, coming before crown or country. This strength of conviction gave many paladins a sense of common fellowship but did not always endear them to others. In many cases, paladins did not get along quite as well with other non-paladin adventurers, with the exception of clerics with similar beliefs.
Many paladins were humans or half-elves, whose shared sense of ambition and purpose made the two races excellent champions of an ideal or the divine. Dwarves were in some ways also well-suited for such a life, owing to their cultural tradition of discipline and religious devotion, though the oath of a paladin meant putting ideals before family and clan, which could be hard on dwarves. Among dwarves, shield dwarves made uncommonly good paladins. Dragonborn could also make for good paladins. Elven paladins were also relatively rare, partially due to the chaotic tendencies of both races. Among other races, paladins were far rarer still, with the exception of strongheart halflings. Paladins could also be found widely in the regions of Cormyr, the Dalelands, Damara, Impiltur, Luiren, Mulhorand, Silverymoon, and Waterdeep.
Paladins, like clerics, were granted their divine powers, known as prayers, through the strength of faith. Their access to the Weave of magic was mediated via a divine force, whether a deity or a paladins sacred oath. The unique aspect of paladins, was that the principal object of their devotion could be a cause, a philosophy of justice and chivalry, or a deity. Like clerics, paladins could enhance these prayers with a holy symbol. Paladins also possessed the ability to funnel the power of the gods through their own body in a special ability known as Channel Divinity. This power allowed paladins a number of abilities, such as turning the undead or other creatures or increasing the power of their attacks. Some paladins also had access to special variations of Channel Divinity dependent on the specific god or philosophy they adhere to for example, with a paladin of Bahamut and one of Oghma having different abilities.

In battle paladins were exceptionally good combatants, equivalent in power to fighters or swordmages, trained in the use of all forms of armor and all melee weapons. Like fighters, paladins trained themselves to master a particular fighting style, such as the use of armor, dueling with one weapon, fighting with a great weapon, or shielding allies from harm. With additional training, paladins could learn to attack more quickly, again much like fighters. Paladins could combine their martial and divine abilities for a powerful effect, expending some of their divine power to enhance an attack with a divine smite that channeled positive energy into the attack, an ability which improved as a paladin grew more powerful. Some paladins could also use similar, less powerful attacks known as strikes. Most if not all strikes and smites required a paladin to be wielding a weapon when casting. Paladins could also use their divine power to protect their allies, scorching foes who attacked their companions with radiant power that interfered with an enemys attacks.
Paladins were also trained in healing, though to a lesser extent than clerics. All paladins possessed an ability known as Lay on Hands, which instantly healed the minor wounds of a comrade and helped them get back on their feet. Their connection to the divine also gave them immunity to practically all disease and allowed them to exude auras of courage and protection that made them and allied creatures immune to fear and more resistant to the effects of mental or physical stress. The most experienced paladins could also use their divine magic to dispel the effect of any spell on themselves or another creature up to a number of times per day dependent upon their conviction and personal magnetism.

Many paladins had other abilities to aid them in their journey. Many good paladins, for instance, had the capacity to detect evil within their presence. It was also traditional for paladins to be trained in riding and several paladins owned mounts who were gifted with sapience and supernatural strength as a boon by the paladins divine patron.
All of these abilities were granted at the behest of the paladins patrons. If a paladin violated the code of conduct laid down by his or her patron, then they could be deprived of their divine abilities, particularly if they showed no sign of repentance. Once "fallen," a paladin could not regain their abilities without appealing to their patron and atoning for their “sins” in an appropriate manner. More minor transgressions could be forgiven through acts of atonement such as an all-night vigil of prayer or fasting.
All paladins swore a series of vows binding them to a particular ethos or set of beliefs that would guide their actions. The most important of these vows, taken after a paladin had some experience fighting and traveling under their belt, were known as a paladins oath and were the final capstone to all their prior preparations. The edicts of this oath differed significantly from one oath to the next, but some of the most commonly sworn oaths are listed below.

Strongly associated with both druids and elves, the Oath of the Ancients was a promise to defend the natural world and all of its creatures against the forces of death and decay. Paladins who swore the Oath of the Ancients — commonly known as fey knights, green knights, or horned knights — were commonly morally sound, ethically ambiguous, caring less for abstract principles like honor or freedom and more for deeply resonant sentiments like joy, kindness, and beauty. Above all else, paladins that took the Oath of Ancients valued the preservation of life. Its four main tenets were
* Kindle the Light. Perform acts of kindness and compassion to inspire hope in those that may otherwise become despondent.
* Shelter the Light. Cultivate goodness, beauty, and jubilation in the surrounding world, and remain a bulwark against the evilness of the world that may threaten it.
* Preserve Your Own Light. Take time to partake in the joys of life to ensure you can safeguard it for others.
* Be the Light. Share your inner spark and exemplify bravery in all your deeds, so that you may serve as an inspiration to those that have succumbed to hopelessness.
For their service, paladins sworn to the Oath of the Ancients were granted a number of potent boons. These paladins could use their Channel Divinity ability to turn fey or fiends and return them to their natural form if they were shapeshifted. The Oath of the Ancients allowed paladins to project from themselves a powerful sphere of warding across a radius of 10 feet or more, protecting themselves and other nearby creatures from enemy spells. The most experienced paladins could even transform themselves into a manifestation of natural fury, taking on such changes in appearance as bark-like skin, leafy hair, or newly grown antlers. This form made the paladins spells more potent and also allowed them to both heal and cast magic more quickly.
Paladins that took the Oath of Conquest sought to bring order to the Realms by means of righteous victory in battle. They devoted themselves to ridding the world from chaos and strife, by destroying them outright. Many Oath of Conquest paladins served gods of war or subscribed to tenets extolling the virtues of warfare. The oath was also often taken by knights of the Nine Hells, that served Bel the former Archduke of Avernus.
Oath of Conquest paladins inscribed the tenets of conquest upon their body
* Douse the flame of hope. Simple victory over an opponent was insufficient, you must crush their spirit to stop them from raising arms again.
* Rule with an iron fist. Yours is the word of law. Disobedience will not be tolerated and only those who obey will receive succor.
* Strength above all. Might makes right. You may only rule so long as you are not supplanted by someone mightier than you.
These paladins were nearly unequaled on the battlefield and projected auras of dread that terrified others.
Paladins that dedicated their service to queen and country, those who promised to uphold the ideals of civilized lands, swore the Oath of the Crown. They fought to uphold law and order in service to a regent, turning back any foe that threatened peace and order within their homeland. These paladins often held membership in one of the numerous knighthoods of the Realms. The oath to their monarch they swore was often one aspect of that organization.
While the specifics of each Oath of the Crown, each held common principles, including
* Law. The rule of law is that which binds the kingdom together, and it is a paladins duty to uphold that ideal.
* Loyalty. Maintain and stand by your word and each promise you make, for they are binding. Failure to do so undermines the rule of law.
* Courage. Take action whenever necessary to demonstrate your loyalty to the crown. There is no one else that will act in your place.
* Responsibility. Every action you take will be one of consequence. Take ownership of how your courage affects the realm.
These paladins were exceptionally selfless and steadfast in battle, shrugging off effects that would hinder others and redirecting attacks upon themselves, so that others were free from harm.

The favorite of paladins who imagined themselves knightly heroes, the Oath of Devotion called upon all those sworn to it to adhere to the highest principles of righteousness, foregoing all loyalties but to the pursuit of justice and the protection of the innocent. Paladins belonging to this oath were often known as cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors and were almost always lawful good. Idolizing angels as the servants of lawful or good deities, paladins sworn to the Oath of Devotion held themselves (and sometimes others) to an extremely high standard of behavior. The key principles of the Oath of Devotion were the following
* Honesty. A paladins oath is only as strong as their word. Their word shall never utter deceptions or falsehoods.
* Courage. Take warning with your actions, but never let those actions be halted by fright or panic.
* Compassion. Always offer succor and safe haven to those that cannot defend themselves. Stand strong against their tormentors and practice forbearance when wise to do so.
* Honor. Conduct your affairs in a manner that exemplifies virtuous integrity to the world. Ensure that the good deeds you perform always outweigh any inadvertent grief you may cause.
* Duty. Follow justly those to whom you serve, ensure ownership of all your deeds, and guard with your life those you are sworn to watch over.
Although the Oath of Devotion was not a path for the weak of spirit, it did have its reward. Paladins with the Oath of Devotion were as capable of turning the undead as any cleric and could turn fiends as well. The gods of law and good who favored those sworn to the Oath also granted them access to a number of potent spells, such as sanctuary, dispel magic, and flame strike. Additionally, the purity of a truly experienced paladin of Devotion was such that they were always under the effect of the protection from evil and good spell, even when it had not been cast.
While many paladins were paragons of virtue and honor, not all were. In some times and places, a different paladin was called upon, one who was willing to do what other paladins were not. These paladins — sometimes known as avengers or dark knights — were sworn to the Oath of Vengeance, a dark pact to utterly destroy the unrighteous by any means necessary. Unconcerned with honor or spiritual purity, paladins sworn to the Oath of Vengeance were often called upon to deal with those that broke legal bindings or otherwise failed to uphold their end of a bargain.
Oath of Vengeance paladins were sworn only to uphold the following values
* Fight the Greater Evil. When presented with the choice, always take up arms against the most malevolent foe possible.
* No Mercy for the Wicked. While some beings are too weak to earn my wrath, sworn foes deserve no such pity nor leniency.
* By Any Means Necessary. The eradication of evil requires singular purpose free from ethics or morality.
* Restitution. Failure to cease destruction caused by the wicked can only be atoned for by aiding their unfortunate victims.
In order to pursue their goal of divinely sanctioned retribution, paladins sworn to the Oath of Vengeance were granted access to a number of spells such as bane, haste, or scrying, as well as a number of other powerful abilities. With training these paladins became relentless hunters, possessed of a supernatural focus that let them close in on a fleeing foe after striking them once in flight. The most powerful of those who followed the Oath of Vengeance were also capable of shapeshifting into the form of an angel, sprouting fully functional wings from their back and radiating an aura of supernatural menace into a sphere of 60 feet in diameter, frightening all but the most strong-willed foes.
Though all paladins shared a number of abilities, some trained themselves to use more specialized techniques. Many paladins belonged to one of the following traditions.
thumb|left|148px|Paladins of the ardent and virtuous varieties.
By far the most martial of all the paladin variants, ardent paladins felt it was their sacred duty to represent the wrath of their god, much like an avenger. This extended to abandoning some of the caution and careful defense of most other paladins and, of all the varying paladin schools, ardent paladins acted with the least regard for their own safety, throwing themselves into the fray with righteous zeal, in order to punish the wicked. To assist them in this task, ardent paladins generally forsook their Lay on Hands ability for the ardent vow prayer, which increased the deadliness of their attacks. As might be expected, ardent paladins generally regarded physical strength as their most important attribute, with high perceptiveness and wisdom secondary features as a means by which to access their gods power. Ardent paladins were less concerned with exuding a charming personality than other paladins, however, instead honing their constitution. Many ardent paladins preferred two-handed weapons, in order to deal the most lethal blows possible.

Avenging paladins felt, more than anything, that it was literally their godsworn mission to vanquish those whose actions and goals opposed their deitys, either directly or indirectly. Enemies of the unholy, avenging paladins felt that the best way to protect the faithful was to ensure that their enemies were either destroyed or routed completely, and avenging paladins focused their training as such, preferring exceptionally deadly prayers over those that healed or defended. To become the deadliest holy soldiers possible, avenging paladins put their prime focus on training their physical strength, though like most paladins they considered willpower and strength of personality to be vital components towards serving their god faithfully. Most avenging paladins preferred large, two-handed weapons, with which they could cause the most possible damage to infidels. Goliaths were well suited to the role of the avenging paladin.
Protecting paladins took the “defender of the faithful” role of the paladin to its logical conclusion. Protecting paladins not only defended their friends and allies from enemy attack, but took on the role of a substitutional cleric, healing and bolstering the abilities of their allies as well. This comes at the cost of sheer lethality and prayers used by protecting paladins tended to be less deadly, though with the benefit of positive secondary effects. Inspiring leaders and possessed of a strong will beyond that of many other paladins, protecting paladins were less concerned with physical strength and of all the paladins tended to possess the least common sense, perhaps because they were so sure of their role and their gods commandments. Protecting paladins favored one-handed melee weapons used in concert with a shield, preferably a heavy shield, which lowered their capacity for damage while bolstering their defense.
While most paladins saw themselves as the champions of their faith through the way in which they acted, virtuous paladins believe it was just as important that a paladin look to inspire others to similar degrees of piety. Virtuous paladins used their holy symbols far more often than other paladins and worked to protect the faithful while also preserving their own lives. Unlike other paladins, virtuous paladins often used ranged attacks alongside melee ones. For virtuous paladins, a shield and melee weapon were the most common arms, though paladins more often preferred to hone their willpower or mental facilities than to train their physical power, though strength remained an important part of their livelihood.
