'''''Flamespin''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] used to create a flaming wheel.

==Effects==
This spell created a 2-foot diameter vertical wheel of fire in the air. The wheel remained stationary unless touched and directed by the caster. The caster alone could touch the wheel without being burned. The caster could interact with the flaming wheel as if it were a solid objectâ€”it could be thrown, bowled, towed, thrust, et cetera. The caster could not use the wheel as a weapon and cast another spell at the same time.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a pinch of either [[phosphorous]] or [[saltpeter]] to cast.
