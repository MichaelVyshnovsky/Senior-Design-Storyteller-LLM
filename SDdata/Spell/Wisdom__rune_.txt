'''''Wisdom''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that improved upon the mental abilities of whoever wielded its inscribed object.

==Effects==
Those who wore the inscribed [[helmet]] or girdle would be granted a mild improvement to both their intellect and wisdom. The duration of this effect was equal to the caster's level. Upon removal of the runed object this effect would instantly cease.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Healing (rune)|healing]]''. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours.
