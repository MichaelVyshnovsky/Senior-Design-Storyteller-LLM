'''''Battle tentacles''''' was a [[wizard]]ly spell that ''[[Conjuration|conjured]]'' deadly black tentacles that lashed at every creature within the spell's area of effect.

==Effects==
When cast, ''battle tentacles'' littered the area with sprouting black rubbery tentacles that emerged from any surface the spell targeted, including water and water surfaces. The tentacles were covered in sporadic fin-like razor-sharp spines. The magical appendages flailed angrily, slamming and cutting everything within their reach. The longer the spell remained active, the more slams these tentacles landed on the creatures trapped within their reach. The spell's range depended on the caster's arcane ability, but the summoned tentacles always covered an area with a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}. The length of the spell increased the stronger the spellcaster was as well. To their summoner, the tentacles were incorporeal, allowing them to move through the flailing limbs freely.

==Components==
''Battle tentacles'' required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. In order to cast this spell, the caster had to acquire a chunk of a tentacle from a [[giant octopus]] or a [[giant squid]], as well as a piece of a spine or bone of any aquatic creature.

==History==
''Battle tentacles'' were among the spells that were exchanged between [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Mordenkainen]], and [[Rautheene]], during one of the regular meetings of [[the Wizards Three]] in the home of [[Ed Greenwood]] of [[Earth]]. The topic of discussion of that particular assembly was "battle spells."
