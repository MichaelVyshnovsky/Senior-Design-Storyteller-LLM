Roots of the assassin was a powerful divine conjuration spell used by priests devoted to Moander, enabling them to create dangerous roots.
This spell created hundreds of vile black roots capable of springing from any surface and strangling whoever triggered the spell. The caster determined the specific trigger for the spell during its casting. The spell could not be triggered by undead or plant-based creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a rotting leaf or rotting piece of wood to cast.
