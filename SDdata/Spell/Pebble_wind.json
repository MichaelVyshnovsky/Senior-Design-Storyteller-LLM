        "mainbody": "'''''Pebble wind''''' was a spell that created a vertiginous mass of air.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell acted in a similar fashion as the ''[[gust of wind]]'' spell, but with a key difference. ''Pebble wind'' not only belted a target with a strong wind, but created a whirlwind that picked up debris such as rocks and [[sand]] and even small items. This created a swirling cloud of detritus. The damage inflicted upon a creature was dependent on what type of debris; loose soil inflicted little damage while pebbles and ricks inflicted more. If a creature was knocked over by the gusts of wind, they fell in a random direction.",
        "Components": "This spell required only a [[verbal component]]."
