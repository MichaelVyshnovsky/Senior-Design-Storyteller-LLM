Silent image, also known as phantasmal force, was an illusion spell that created the image of an object, a creature, or another visible manifestation.
The spell created an image no larger than a cube 15 ft (4.6 m) on a side within a range of 60 ft (18.3 m). The image lasted for as long as the caster kept concentrating on it, for a maximum of 10 minutes. The image did not produce any sound or smell, and objects could pass through it.
The image could also be moved at the casters command. Its form could be altered to be made consistent with its movement, such as the natural walking motion of a creature.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material required was a bit of fleece.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Carbury in  and was originally known as Carburys force.
