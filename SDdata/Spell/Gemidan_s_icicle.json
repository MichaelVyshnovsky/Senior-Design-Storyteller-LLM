        "mainbody": "'''''Gemidan's icicle''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that functioned as a variant of ''[[Snilloc's snowball]]''.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a ice-blue bolt that streaked forth towards a target person or creature. When it struck, a inch-thick (2.5 cm) patch of ice formed in a 3' (0.9 m) radius centered upon the point of collision. This effect had the potential of temporarily freezing an opponent's hands or blinding their eyes.\n\nWhen cast by more experienced [[mage]]s, the spell had a greater effective range.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''icicle'' required a small piece of [[ivory]] or a chuck of ice to be cast.",
        "History": "This spell was developed by the [[wizard]] [[Gemidan]], who served as apprentice to the original [[Blackstaff]], [[Khelben Arunsun]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. As of the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], it was known by a select few individuals, namely Gemidan, Khelben and [[Laeral Silverhand]]."
