'''''Echolocation''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[elemental water sphere]] that allowed the caster to perceive their underwater surroundings via sound.<ref name=SoFS-p114">

==Effects==
This spell provided the caster with a clear image of all surfaces and objects within {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} in any direction while they were underwater. Concealed doors were also revealed. The caster could perform other oral actions while the spell remained active provided they periodically sent out another blast of sound with their mouth.<ref name=SoFS-p114"/>

''Echolocation'' could also be used offensively by focusing the sound into a tight beam that physically harmed a single target and stunned them for several minutes.<ref name=SoFS-p114"/>

This spell was incredibly taxing on the caster's vocal chords, preventing any form of speech for one hour after following the spell's expiration.<ref name=SoFS-p114"/>

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to cast.<ref name=SoFS-p114"/>
