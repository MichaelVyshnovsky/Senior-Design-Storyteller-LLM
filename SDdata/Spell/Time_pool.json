        "mainbody": "'''''Time pool''''' was a [[divine]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to enchant a pool of water, revealing specific events from the past.",
        "Effects": "The spell could summon visions of the past when cast upon a [[mirror]], a pool of water, or any other reflective surface. The images created by the spell were of perfect clarity and realism, as if the cleric witnessed the past being present at the scene. The image lasted accordingly to the spell-caster's skills with magics. However, the spell had limitations and did not reveal events that transpired on other planes.\n\nTo divine the past via the ''time pool'' spell, the caster had to know some details about the event they wanted to witness. The spell was dependant on the verbal request uttered by the priest. The more detailed and eloquent the request was, the more chances the spell had to succeed. Needless to say, the wiser the caster was, the easier ''time pool'' was to cast. The success rate went up significantly if the caster observed the event through the spell before.\n\nThe spell was impossible to cast while traversing ''[[phlogiston]]''.",
        "Components": "''Time pool'' required verbal, somatic, and physical components to be cast. Physical components were a reflective surface and a pinch of powdered [[quartz]], while verbal component was the request with the description of the event divined.",
        "Notable Users": "*[[Labelasan]] specialty priests â€“ [[Chronologian]]s, when reached appropriate skill, gained access  to the ''time pool'' spell as well as other ''[[chronomancy]]'' magics.\n*Lady [[Shadowmoon Crystalembers]], also known as the Guardian of the [[Chondalwood]], an extraordinarily powerful [[elven]] [[druid]] of [[Silvanus]] and a member of the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n*''[[Mighty Rune of the Master]]'', an artifact ''[[spellbook]]'' associated with the [[Church of Deneir]] contained a written copy of the ''time pool'' spell."
