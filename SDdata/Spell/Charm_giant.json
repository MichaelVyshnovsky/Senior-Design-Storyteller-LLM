        "mainbody": "Charm giant was a spell identical to charm person except it only functioned on true giants.\nWhen cast, the targeted giant perceived the caster as a trusted and valued friend, someone to be respected, protected, and listened to. However, the spell did not grant the caster complete control over the charmed giant, as they retained their own agency. Nevertheless, every word and action of the caster was interpreted in the most favorable and positive light. As a result, a charmed giant would not blindly obey a command that lead to their own harm or demise, such as a suicidal act. However, they may genuinely believe the caster if they were assured that their actions were crucial for saving the casters life, even if it meant facing a formidable red dragon for just a brief period of time.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
