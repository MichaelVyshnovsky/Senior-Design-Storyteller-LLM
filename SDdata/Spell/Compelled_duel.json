        "mainbody": "Compelled duel was an enchantment spell that by divine command compelled a duel with a target.\nThe caster would compel a duel with a target within . If the target failed to resist, then it would have to try and engage with the caster. The target was at a disadvantage when attacking others and if the caster attacked someone else the spell would end.\nOnly a vocal component was needed for the casting.\nSome time during or before the late 1490s DR, the Thayan paladin Xenk Yendar compelled the elder brain Zuphelithid to a duel to the death. Xenk emerged as the victor."
