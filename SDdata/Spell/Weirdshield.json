        "mainbody": "Weirdshield was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, this spell created a powerful magical barrier in a location of the casters choosing. This barrier was triangular in shape and had tentacles along the edge, each with a humanoid hand at the end. Once cast, the caster was able to move the barrier. Swords created from magic, including swords of dancing within  were instantly drawn to this barrier, which then destroyed them. When the barrier was within  of the caster, it protected them from magical attacks, reflecting the spell back to the creature who cast it. The barrier was able to block incorporeal creatures. It was also immune to all physical attacks and nearly all magical attacks. If this barrier came into contact with another type of barrier spell, both spells instantly expired. The only other way the spell could be defeated was either by a dispel magic, limited wish, or wish spell, or if the caster was killed. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required several material components the casters saliva, a small shield, and an arm.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor."
