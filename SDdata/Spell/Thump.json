        "mainbody": "Thump was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell was used by geisha to rebuff an attacking creature. The spell summoned an ornamental fan which thumped the aggressive creature. The hostility was then turned onto the creature itself, which left it confused and incoherent. \nThe spell required somatic, verbal and material components."
