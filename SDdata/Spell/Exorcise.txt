'''''Exorcise''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that negated possession of a creature or object by an outside force.

==Effects==
Once begun, the casting of the ''exorcise'' spell could not be interrupted or else it would be ruined. The spell stood a greater chance of succeeding if the casting [[priest]] was more powerful than the controlling entity.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] and some [[holy water]] to cast. Possession of a religious artifact would greatly increase the chance of the spell's success.

==History==
''Exorcise'' was need to prevent a destroyed [[flameskull]] from reforming.
