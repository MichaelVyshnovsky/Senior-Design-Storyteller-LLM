Chariot of Sustarre was an evocation spell that tapped into the Elemental Plane of Fire, bringing forth a large, flaming chariot pulled by two flaming horses.
Upon being cast, the spells namesake chariot of Sustarre and the pair of steeds pulling it appeared from a cloud of smoke with the sound of a thunderclap. The chariot was large enough to seat 8 human-sized creatures, although in order to not be harmed by the flames that wreathed the vehicle and the horses, any additional passengers had to be "designated" by the caster through physical touch.
The chariot, which was moved by the casters verbal commands, could either move on the ground at a fairly fast pace or fly at double that speed. It and the horses pulling it were invulnerable to any fire-based attacks from outside, although these could still harm the caster and any other passengers as normal. Certain spells, like dispel magic and holy word, forced the chariot back to the Elemental Plane of Fire, leaving its passengers behind.
As the spell required a connection to the Ethereal plane in order to reach the Elemental Plane of Fire, this spell was impossible to cast on the Astral and Outer Planes.
The spell required a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a flame at least as big as a torch.
