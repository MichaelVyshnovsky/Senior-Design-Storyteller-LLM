'''''Chariot of Sustarre''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that tapped into the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], bringing forth a large, flaming [[chariot]] pulled by two flaming [[horse]]s.

==Effects==
Upon being cast, the spell's namesake ''chariot of Sustarre'' and the pair of steeds pulling it appeared from a cloud of smoke with the sound of a thunderclap. The chariot was large enough to seat 8 human-sized creatures, although in order to not be harmed by the flames that wreathed the vehicle and the horses, any additional passengers had to be "designated" by the caster through physical touch.

The chariot, which was moved by the caster's verbal commands, could either move on the ground at a fairly fast pace or fly at double that speed. It and the horses pulling it were invulnerable to any fire-based attacks from outside, although these could still harm the caster and any other passengers as normal. Certain spells, like ''[[dispel magic]]'' and ''[[holy word]]'', forced the chariot back to the Elemental Plane of Fire, leaving its passengers behind.

As the spell required a connection to the [[Ethereal plane]] in order to reach the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], this spell was impossible to cast on the [[Astral Plane|Astral]] and [[Outer Planes]].

==Components==
The spell required a small piece of [[wood]], two [[holly]] berries, and a flame at least as big as a torch.

==History==
Powerful [[Netheril|Netherese]] druids were known to use ''chariot of Sustarre''.

The [[Church of Lathander|Lathanderian]] artifact known as the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]'' contained a copy of this spell.

[[Alustriel Silverhand]] was well known for casting this spell. One time she cast this spell in order to allow [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] and [[Cattie-brie]] to quickly cover hundreds of miles in order to reach their friends [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Wulfgar]] in time to provide them aid against the pirates of the [[Sea Sprite]].

The [[Padhran religion|Padhran]] artifact ''[[Byubo's Lamp of Audacity]]'', which was kept in the Purple Priory of the [[Rainbow Monastery]], could grant adherents of the Padhran faith temporary access to any of a number of spells, including ''chariot of Sustarre''.

In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, the [[Church of Helm|Helmite]] Exalted Inquisitor [[Parell Hyath]] transported the wizard [[Keane]] from [[Baldur's Gate]] to the [[Moonshae Isles]] in a ''chariot of Sustarre''.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

The enigmatic Lady [[Shadowmoon Crystalembers]] of the [[Chondalwood]] was known to use ''chariot of Sustarre''.
