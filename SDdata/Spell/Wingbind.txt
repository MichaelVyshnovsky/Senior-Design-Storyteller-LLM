'''''Wingbind''''' was a very rare combat [[spell]]. It was originally useable only by dragons.

==Effects==
This spell was only effective against other dragons. When cast, a web of force wrapped around the target dragon. The spell prevented the dragon from flying. If cast on a dragon already in flight, the targeted dragon fell and slammed into the ground.

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.

==History==
A version available in {{yearlink|1367}} could only be cast by [[dragon]]s: supposedly, it would be akin to the highest magic if cast by anyone else. However, by {{yearlink|1372}}, a version with no such limitations was circulating.
