        "mainbody": "Tool was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA wu jen used this spell to create common items or tools. The desired item instantly appeared within the spells area of effect. The wu jen could create more than one item. The items remained afterwards, they did not vanish when the spell expired. The items a wu jen could create with this spell included armor, food or tools, and even large items such as boats and wagons. This spell even created a horse if the wu jen so desired. Money, however, could not be created with this spell.\nThis spell required only a verbal component to be cast."
