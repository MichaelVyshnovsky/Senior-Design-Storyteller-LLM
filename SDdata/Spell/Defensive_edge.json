When reversed, it hampered instead.\nIn its straight form, it granted the subject glimpses of coming blows, giving it an edge in defense. In its reversed form, the whispers served to mislead instead, hampering its defenses. Both lasted for roughly half a minute.\nThe utterance was known to garblers, who only used it in its reversed form."
