        "Usage": "In its straight form, it granted the subject glimpses of coming blows, giving it an edge in defense. In its reversed form, the whispers served to mislead instead, hampering its defenses. Both lasted for roughly half a minute.",
        "History": "The utterance was known to [[garbler]]s, who only used it in its reversed form.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|267}}"
