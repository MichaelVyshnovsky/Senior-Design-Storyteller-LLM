As an alternative, the spell could summon one to three ghouls, one to three huge skeletons, one to three large zombies, two to five large or medium-sized skeletons, or two to five medium-sized or small zombies&mdashprovided they were all within 30 feet of each other. \nIf a ghast or ghoul were summoned, the spell was considered a chaotic spell in addition to an evil one.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a lich, mummy or vampire.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
