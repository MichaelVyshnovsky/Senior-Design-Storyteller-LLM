        "Effects": "The spell created a barreling river of [[sand]] that was {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} in length. The caster cast the spell with a mouthful of sand and spat it in the direction they wished the river to flow. The caster could not control the length of the river; it always formed the same length. Nor could the caster change the direction of the river. Once formed, the river of sand rushed over anything in its path.\n\nThe river struck with enough force to rip clothing and hair from creatures, lift large [[wagon]]s, or batter objects like a ram. Living creatures engulfed by the river of sand risked suffocation.",
        "Components": "This spell required a mouthful of sand and a little spittle as [[material component]]s in order to cast."
