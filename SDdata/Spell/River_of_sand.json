        "mainbody": "River of sand was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThe spell created a barreling river of sand that was  in length. The caster cast the spell with a mouthful of sand and spat it in the direction they wished the river to flow. The caster could not control the length of the river it always formed the same length. Nor could the caster change the direction of the river. Once formed, the river of sand rushed over anything in its path.\nThe river struck with enough force to rip clothing and hair from creatures, lift large wagons, or batter objects like a ram. Living creatures engulfed by the river of sand risked suffocation.\nThis spell required a mouthful of sand and a little spittle as material components in order to cast."
