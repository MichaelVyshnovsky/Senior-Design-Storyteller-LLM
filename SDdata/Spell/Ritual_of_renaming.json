        "mainbody": "'''Ritual of renaming''' was a spell that forever transformed the creature's [[true name]].",
        "Effects": "A successful ritual of renaming completely removed all connection between the target and its prior [[true name]], giving it a new true name in its stead. This new truename was known only to the caster, the target, and those attending.",
        "Components": "Alongside [[verbal component]]s and [[somatic component]]s, the ritual called for a loss to the caster's self, their energy, their experience, and it demanded the subject's [[true name]] be spoken correctly, which was often a taxing [[truespeak]] task. If the true name was not spoken correctly, the spell failed.",
        "History": "This spell was necessary in order to become a [[bereft]].{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|208}}"
