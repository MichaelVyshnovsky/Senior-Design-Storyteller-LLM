        "mainbody": "Ritual of renaming was a spell that forever transformed the creatures true name.\nA successful ritual of renaming completely removed all connection between the target and its prior true name, giving it a new true name in its stead. This new truename was known only to the caster, the target, and those attending.\nAlongside verbal components and somatic components, the ritual called for a loss to the casters self, their energy, their experience, and it demanded the subjects true name be spoken correctly, which was often a taxing truespeak task. If the true name was not spoken correctly, the spell failed.\nThis spell was necessary in order to become a bereft."
