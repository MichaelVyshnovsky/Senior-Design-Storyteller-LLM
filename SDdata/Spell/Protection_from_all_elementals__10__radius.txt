Protection from all elementals, 10 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay
This spell created a spherical barrier which protected an area from elementals. Elementals were unable to get within 10 feet (3 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an elemental, nor ranged weapons.
The spell protected against
* Air elementals and similar creature such as djinn and invisible stalkers.
* Earth elementals and similar creature such as xorn.
* Fire elementals and similar creature such as efreet and salamanders.
* Water elementals and similar creature such as tritons and water weirds.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a material which is not found on either the Prime Material Plane or any of the Elemental Planes.
