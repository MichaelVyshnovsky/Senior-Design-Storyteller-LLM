'''''Spendelarde's chaser''''' was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] spell that alleviated pain and the undesirable side effects of drugs and alcohol, and provided significant protection against [[poison]]s.

==Effects==
This spell could be used on one creature no bigger than an [[ogre]], and maintained its efficacy for at least an hour, or longer depending on the skill of the caster. All unwanted effects due to drugs and alcohol, such as nausea, headache, degraded eye/hand coordination, mental impairment, or unconsciousness, were instantly cured or restored by this spell.

This spell did not heal damage to the mind or body, did not work against magical curses or effects, and did nothing for insanity&mdash;it merely assisted the metabolism to remove foreign chemicals.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a drop of [[holy water]] which had to be applied to the tongue or skin of the recipient.

==History==
Spendelard originally created this spell as a cure for hangovers, and its protection against poison was discovered later.
