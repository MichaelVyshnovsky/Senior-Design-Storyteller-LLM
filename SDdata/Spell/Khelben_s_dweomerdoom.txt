Khelbens dweomerdoom was a powerful arcane abjuration spell that countered an opponents spell before it was cast.
This spell removed the most powerful spell currently prepared and memorized by the casters target.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a crystal lens worth at least 1,000 gp to cast. The lens could be reused.
This spell was developed by Khelben Arunsun of Waterdeep.
