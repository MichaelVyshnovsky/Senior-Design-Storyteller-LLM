'''''Hold portal''''' was a low-level [[arcane]] [[spell]] that magically locked a door. It was formerly known as '''''Undine's hold portal'''''.

==Effects==
As the name said, ''hold portal'' magical held closed any door, gate, shutter, or window, whether it was fashioned of metal, stone, or wood. It could target only one such opening, but it could be up to 20 square feet (1.85 square meters) in area and up to 100 feet (30 meters) away at minimum casting, while more experienced casters could extend this. For all intents and purposes, the door was securely closed and locked as it would be under normal circumstances. It could still be forced open, but was rather harder to do so.

The spell could also be used on existing portals that went through [[crystal sphere]]s, as long as they were sufficiently small to fit within its area of effect.

The effect lasted for a number of minutes, or until the caster wished to dismiss it. However, a ''[[knock]]'' spell or ''[[dispel magic]]'' would end it.

==Components==
The required only a verbal component.

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Undine]] in [[-921 DR|2938 NY (âˆ’921 DR)]].
