'''''Vampiric lash''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was identical to ''[[forcelash]]'' but more powerful. When cast, a long whip of energy was created at the end of the caster's arm or other limb chosen during casting. This powerful whip was controlled by the caster's willpower and was able to attack a target within {{SI|80|ft}} of the caster. The whip was strong enough to penetrate most barrier or protection spells like ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]''. When struck, the targeted creature became immobile and was wracked with painful spasms as energy coursed through their body. In addition, the spell slowly drained the life force of the targeted creature.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s in the form of hair and three teeth from any creature.

==History==
This spell was originally created by the phaerimms of [[Myth Drannor]].
