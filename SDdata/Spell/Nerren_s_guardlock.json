        "Effects": "The ''guardlock'' spell operated as a version of ''[[arcane lock]]'' which unleashed a volley of ''[[magic missile]]s'' into the first unauthorized creature to touch it. However, every time someone failed to dispel it or cancel it with a ''[[knock]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell, the spell instead absorbed the magic and stored it as an additional volley of magic missiles.",
