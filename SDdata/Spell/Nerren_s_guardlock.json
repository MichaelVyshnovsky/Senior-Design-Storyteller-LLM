        "mainbody": "Nerrens guardlock was a combination spell attributed to Nerren Prentiyuel. It combined the effects of arcane lock with magic missile.\nThe guardlock spell operated as a version of arcane lock which unleashed a volley of magic missiles into the first unauthorized creature to touch it. However, every time someone failed to dispel it or cancel it with a knock or dispel magic spell, the spell instead absorbed the magic and stored it as an additional volley of magic missiles.\nThe material component for this spell was a spiders web and a strand of the casters hair.\nThe spell was attributed to Nerren Prentiyuel."
