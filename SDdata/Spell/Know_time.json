        "mainbody": "Know time was a divine divination spell from the time sphere that enabled the caster to determine the precise time of day.\nKnow time was particularly useful if the caster had lost time from a bout of unconsiousness or similar situations. Time determined was accurated to the exact year, month, day, and hour.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the know time spell."
