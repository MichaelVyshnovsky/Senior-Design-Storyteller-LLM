Knights move was a divine transmutation or alteration spell similar to blink that teleported the caster diagonally for a surprise attack or a surprise escape, making it a favorite of Red Knightist clerics.
When cast, this spell caused the caster to instantaneously transit the Astral Plane and reappear a short distance away, in the manner of a knight-errant chess move&mdashin a spot two-thirds the total distance in one direction and the remaining third in a perpendicular direction. The maximum linear distance that could be teleported was , broken into two steps  in one direction and  in a perpendicular direction. Higher level casters could extend this range but the movement was always in two-thirds/one-third proportion.
If the point of arrival was already occupied by a solid object, the spell fizzled.
An earlier version of this spell allowed the caster to make more than one knights move as desired, but in lieu of any other action, before the spell expired. It was also less constrained on the destination, allowing the caster to blink to any location in sight as long as it was within range (which was determined by the level of the caster, but no more than 120 feet or about 37 meters away).
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, as well as the clerics holy symbol or divine focus.
