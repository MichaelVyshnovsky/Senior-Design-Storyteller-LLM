'''''Lifequench''''' was a perilous [[spell]] that augmented another at the expense of a victim's life.

==Effects==
The spell first quenched a target's life, snuffing them out instantly, and then augmented a spell still in the caster's mind to double their normal power, increasing area, damage, and duration. It could be thwarted if the target survived.

==Components==
The first [[somatic]] component for the spell was grabbing the target; the spell also had a [[verbal]] component.

==History==
In [[Cormanthyr]], as of {{yearlink|261}}, the spell was meant only for use in protection of the [[Coronal]]; nonetheless, [[Llombaerth Starym]] taught it to [[Elminster]] and tricked him into casting it to slay [[Nacacia]], another of Llombaerth's apprentices, to augment an antimagic effect atop a hut. Through the scheme, he framed Elminster for [[Mythanthar]]'s death.
