        "mainbody": "Beltyns burning blood was a necromancy spell that caused blood flowing out of open wounds to become corrosive.Dreams of the Red Wizards refers to this spell as \"Beltens burning blood\". Spell Compendium simply calls it \"burning blood\". \nThe target of this spell was one creature that had open, bleeding wounds caused by an edged weapon or similar means (wounds from blunt weapons or those that had been dressed or healed did not produce enough blood). Alternatively, after the , the target could be uninjured, but the caster supplied the blood. The range of this spell was 10 yards (9.1 meters) per the casters level or  or more, and it did not require line of sight to the target. The target had to have blood (undead, elementals, plants, oozes, etc. were immune) and not be impervious to fire. The exposed blood was subtly and temporarily changed to become hot and corrosive to surrounding tissue. The burning lasted for some time, but the victim had several chances to resist before it ended.\nBeltyns burning blood could not be cast into the ethereal plane from the Prime Material Plane, but creatures that changed shape to hide wounds, or that melded with objects, such as trees or stones, could still be the target of this spell and suffer its effects.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pinch of saltpeter and blood, which could be that of a creature with open, bleeding wounds within range which they put the blood in their mouth and spat as they uttered the words of the spell.\nThe spell was created by, or at least attributed to, the early mage Beltyn. It was included in the Book of Bats some time before the mid–12 century DR.While a date is unknown, the chronology of the Book of Bats suggests Beltyn was alive a long time before the mid–12 century DR.\nThis spell was published in \"Volos Guide to All Things Magical\" and became generally known to the magical community, albeit still rare, by 1358 DR.\nThe spell was available to clerics of Karsus."
