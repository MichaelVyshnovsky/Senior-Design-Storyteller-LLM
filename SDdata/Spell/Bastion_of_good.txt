Bastion of good was a divine abjuration spell that conjured a mighty barrier against evil attacks.
The caster surrounded themselves in a nimbus of light, extending to 20 feet (6.1 meters) in all directions. This warded all those inside from the attacks and magic of evil creatures, shielding them as a magic circle against evil would, but at double strength, and excluding lesser spells just like a minor globe of invulnerability. Thus they gained a higher chance of deflecting attacks and were more likely to resist attacks by evil creatures. Moreover, they were immune to possession and mind control by summoned or conjured creatures and could not be touched by them.
In addition to verbal and somatic component, the caster must have fasted for 24 hours before casting in an act of abstinence.
