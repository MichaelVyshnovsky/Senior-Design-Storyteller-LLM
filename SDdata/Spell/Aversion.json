        "mainbody": "Aversion was a psionic power of the telepathy discipline that caused the subject to avoid a chosen action, place, or person.\nAfter contact was made, the manifester implanted in the mind of the subject a strong aversion to a certain action, event, location, object, person, or creature of the manifesters choosing. The subject would then do all they could to avoid the target of their aversion if a location, object, or person, they would not willingly approach within  or later of it, and would back away as soon as they could if they were too close if a word, they would not speak it if an action, they would not choose to do it and if an event, they would not become involved. While the subject did everything reasonable in their power to avoid the target of their aversion, they would not endanger themselves. For example, a fighter could be made to have an aversion to battle or her sword, but if forced to defend herself, she would fight or use the sword if no other weapon was available. If forced to perform an action they had an aversion to, their revulsion showed in reduced skill at the task.\nThe aversion could be maintained for ten minutes or as long as the manifester maintained it or later for three hours or longer for more experienced manifesters or those who could spend more psionic energy on it.\nIt could require contact and mindlink to learn.\nIt had standard auditory and material displays.\nAversion was known by hauns. They would give foes an aversion to worms (which they more-or-less were) while they escaped or drive trespassers away from their lairs. Brain moles used aversion to discourage attackers.\nIn psionics terms, aversion could be known by yuan-ti, particularly abominations, whod use it to give targets an aversion to snakes."
