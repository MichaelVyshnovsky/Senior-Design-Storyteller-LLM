The dilation group of spells were alteration spells used by wizards.
Dilation I and dilation II allowed the caster to increase the area of effect for the spell cast immediately after. If more than a minute passed before the second spell was cast then the dilation spell was wasted.
Dilation I increased the area of effect of basic spells by a quarter. Dilation II increased the area of effect of basic spells by half and intermediate spells by a quarter.
These spells only required verbal components to cast.
