The '''''dilation''''' group of [[spell]]s were [[alteration]] spells used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
''Dilation I'' and ''dilation II'' allowed the caster to increase the area of effect for the spell cast immediately after. If more than a minute passed before the second spell was cast then the ''dilation'' spell was wasted.

''Dilation I'' increased the area of effect of basic spells by a quarter. ''Dilation II'' increased the area of effect of basic spells by half and intermediate spells by a quarter.

==Components==
These spells only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] components to cast.
