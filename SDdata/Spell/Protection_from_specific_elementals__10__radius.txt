Protection from specific elementals, 10 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay
This spell was compromised of four sub-spells, each spell targeting a specific elemental. Each spell had to be memorized individually by the caster. Selected elementals were unable to get within 10 feet (3 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an elemental, nor ranged weapons.
The sub-spells protected against
* Air elementals and similar creature such as djinn and invisible stalkers.
* Earth elementals and similar creature such as xorn.
* Fire elementals and similar creature such as efreet and salamanders.
* Water elementals and similar creature such as tritons and water weirds.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component.
The material component was determined by what elemental the caster wished to defend against
* Air elemental a smouldering ember from a fire.
* Earth elemental a small fan.
* Fire elemental a vial of water.
* Water elemental a handful of dirt.
