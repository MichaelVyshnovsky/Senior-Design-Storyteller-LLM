Wealthtwist was a divine magic spell granted to specialty priests and other followers of Waukeen. It converted material wealth directly into a beneficial spell.
This spell could transform coins, gems, and/or trade bars into one of the following beneficial spells cure blindness or deafness, cure disease, cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, cure critical wounds, dimension door, heal, neutralize poison, or regenerate. The amount of wealth consumed was directly proportional to the level of the beneficial spell being cast, at a rate of 250 gold pieces per level of the spell.
The boon was chosen by the caster and he or she had to touch the payment as part of the casting of wealthtwist. If the value of the monetary sacrifice was insufficient for the spell effect chosen, the caster was immediately aware of this and either had to choose a lesser spell, or touch more funds within the two minute casting time. Otherwise, the wealthtwist spell was wasted. Upon receipt of sufficient payment, the beneficial spell was then cast on a person or creature (possibly the caster) by touch.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell consumed a quantity of coins, gems, and/or trade bars of sufficient value to cast the desired beneficial spell.
This spell was typically used on merchants that worshiped Waukeen and donated money to the church.
