        "mainbody": "'''''Khelben's suspended silence''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created a field of ''[[silence]]'' around any inanimate object that was smaller than the caster.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast on any item smaller than the caster, such as a stone, piece of furniture, [[weapon]] or even the corpse of a smaller-sized creature. Once cast, and a [[command word]] was chosen, the item was imbued with the magical effects of ''suspended silence'' bur remained inactive. This magic left a faint, but detectable aura that could be readily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''.\n\nWhen the item was touched and the command word spoken, a magical sphere of silence, 20' (6.1 m) in radius, emanated from the center-point of the affected object. The sphere moved with the object and remained for approximately 36 seconds.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a feather and a handful of dust.",
        "History": "This spell was developed by the first [[Blackstaff]], [[Khelben Arunsun]], sometime prior to the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].While no date is given for [[The Ruins of Undermountain]], it was a 2{{nd}} edition sourcebook that pre-dated the 3{{rd}} edition material that began in the year [[1372 DR]]."
