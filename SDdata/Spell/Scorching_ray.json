        "mainbody": "'''''Scorching ray''''' was a low-powered [[evocation]] [[spell]] that blasted opponents with rays of [[fire]].",
        "Effects": "Upon successfully completing the spell, the caster aimed his or her hands at a target or multiple targets within close range and projected a number of fiery bolts. The number of rays increased with the power of the caster; the most powerful casters were said to have been capable of shooting three such rays with a single casting. Whatever the number, the flaming bolts were fired simultaneously and were limited to striking targets no more than ten yards (nine meters) away from each other.",
        "Components": "The spell simply required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
