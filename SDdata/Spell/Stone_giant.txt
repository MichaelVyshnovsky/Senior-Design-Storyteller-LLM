'''Stone giants''', called '''''steinjotunen''''' in their own language,, were a reclusive and artistic race of [[giant|giants]] that lived in underground and mountainous environments.
{{Quote
|We all know of [[dwarf|dwarves]] who fell so deep in love with their craft, or the seeking of treasure or [[ale]], that that they forgot how to live in any other way but in pursuit of it. That's what stone giants do.

==Description==
The bodies of stone giants had a gray to grayish-brown skin tone, hair that ranged in a spectrum of dark grays and bluish-grays, and eyes of a silver or steel hue. They also tended to wear clothing that was of a similar color to nearby rocks, which altogether made it easy for their race to blend in with their environment when needed.

Adults averaged about {{SI|18|ft|long=yes}} in height, although fossilized stone giants from the era of [[Ostoria]] show that in the past their race was capable of reaching heights of up to {{SI|24|ft|long=yes}}. Though thinner and less bulky than [[fire giant]]s, who were about the same height on average, a stone giant's thicker, heavier flesh made them weigh significantly more, at about {{SI|9000|lb|k|long=yes}}.{{Giant vitals/Stone giant}}

==Abilities==
Stone giants had an excellent sense of smell and had [[infravision]] sight of up to {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}}. Stone giants were the longest living of the giants and generally considered among their peers to be the wisest of all giant races, despite their low position in the [[Ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']]. And their hearts were known to beat four times slower than that of a [[human]].

==Combat==
Stone giants preferred to fight using ranged weapons such as boulders, but if forced into melee they wielded gigantic stone [[club]]s.

==History==
The stone giant race began with an individual by the name of [[Obadai]], one of the mortal children of [[Annam All-Father]] and [[Othea]], who in the kingdom of [[Ostoria]] was ceded control of the Underdark.{{cite book/Giantcraft|7}} Within this mighty kingdom they created some of the greatest works of giant art. For example, they would regularly carve stalactites and pillars so that they resonated in the wind, thus creating a sort of song that was attuned to whoever stood before them.

==Sub-Races==
;[[Ash giant]]s: An offshoot of stone giants that lived in the [[Black Ash Plain]] of [[east Faer√ªn]]. Their size and skin tone was approximately the same, though their bodies were hairless and their eyes a deep-set black. They often smeared themselves with ash as camouflage and were known to be [[shaman]]s who specialized in controlling the ashes and embers common in their homeland.<ref>

;[[Phaerlin giant]]s: An offshoot that was created by the magic of the [[phaerimm]], sometime after those aberrations were imprisoned in the Underdark. While intelligent enough to speak, phaerlin giants were savage brutes and had little in common with their stone giant forebears. Their bodies were hairless, had hardened skin very similar to that of a [[beholder]], and were hunched from living in tight tunnels. They generally walked using both their feet and hands. They eschewed weapons, preferring to attack with their claws and the razor sharp teeth embedded in their protruding jaws.

;[[Craa'ghoran giant]]s: Stone giants who had been exposed long ago to [[Earth (element)|elemental energy]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] by [[Druid|druidic]] devotees of [[Gond]]. They were taller than stone giants, could live up to 8,000 years, and could weigh up to ten times more than them due to the massive chunks of rock that formed much of their bodies. They were cruel hunters who delighted in using their innate abilities to create a maze of [[trap]]s and blind corners for prey to get lost in. They did retain their ancestors love of art, creating massive and beautiful stone carvings with their magic.

==Society==
Stone giant family bonds were less important than the bonds between a master and his pupil.<ref>https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1534-giant-personalities-an-infographic-on-the

The strongest stone giant nation was [[Cairnheim]] in the [[Underdark]]. located in the western part of the [[Darklands]] in the [[Upperdark]] inside the [[Giant's Run Mountains]] under the rule of the stone giant [[lich]] [[Dodkong]].

Stone giants that spent too much time on the surface, either during their dream quests or as a result of banishment from their communities, became [[stone giant dreamwalker|dreamwalkers]], driven so far into madness by their isolation to the point that reality itself bent around them.
===Lycanthropy===
Due to the resilience of their skin, stone giants were known to be immune to all forms of [[lycanthropy]].{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}}
===Homelands===
These giants were typically found living in temperate mountain ranges, caves, or caverns.

Stone giants were powerful enough to survive and make a living in the [[Underdark]] in the face of competition. They had a tendency to gather in larger individual groups the deeper the given group was located, but were primarily denizens of the [[Upperdark]], though their numbers were small even there.

They carved their homes out of the rock and had a reputation as good artisans, though they generally maintained an uncaring stance towards other denizens of the Underdark and expected the same stance from the others.

===Languages===
Stone giants were known to speak the general giant language [[Jotun]] and their own dialect known as Jotunstein, which was derived from both Jotun and [[Auld Dwarvish]].
====Names====
Common given names among stone giants included the following:<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-25 - Common Giant Names
}}

;Males: Falkh, Hundar, Korlgar, Kuljarn, Sulfulkh, Valgusk, Vorold, and Yulhamur.
;Females: Beldra, Gillauga, Gurdis, Moada, Oskra, Ragnara, Rakra, Skarla, Woave, and Zarka.

===Religion===
Like all true giants, stone giants worshiped [[Annam All-Father]] as their chief deity, but unlike the other races they envisioned him as being an artist whose skills were perfection. Their patron deity among Annam's children was [[Skoraeus Stonebones]], though lesser deities [[Hiatea]] and [[Iallanis]] were also known to have a significant following among the stone giants.

[[Priest]]s of Skoraeus felt that their duty was to oversee their society's affairs and ensure that the stone giants as a whole continued to progress towards greater achievements in art and intellectual thought. But in order to accomplish this goal, they believed that their race needed to isolate itself from others, with the exception of individuals who might help expand upon their mastery of craftsmanship.

===Relationships===
Animal domestication was not common among them, though many were known to raise colonies of [[giant bat|giant bats]] as a warning system and source of food. and [[cave bear]]s.

==Usages==
Stone giants' finger bones were used by crafters from the [[Old Empires]] to create more powerful versions of ''[[ring of strength|rings of strength]]''.

==Notable Stone Giants==
* [[Dodkong]], a stone giant [[lich]] and chieftain of [[Cairnheim]].
* [[Kayalithica]], ruler of the stone giants during the time of the ordning shattering.
* [[Yauln]]

==Trivia==
* Historians gave the year [[-160 DR]] the epithet ''"Year of the Stone Giant."''
