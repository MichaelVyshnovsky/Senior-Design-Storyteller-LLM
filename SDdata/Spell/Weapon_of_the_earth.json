        "mainbody": "Weapon of the earth was a spell used by dwarven clerics.\nWhen cast, this spell transformed a piece of stone into a weapon. The stone had to be of the same volume as the weapon. The weapon that was created was associated with the weapon of the casters deity. The weapon acted as its mundane equivalent, however it was immune to spells and effects the targeted metal. It was also immune to corrosion and rusting. The weapon was vulnerable to spells and effects that targeted stone. The weapon returned to its natural state once the spell expired.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components. It required the casters holy symbol, the targeted chunk of stone and a piece of iron ore. The iron ore was consumed by the spell."
