'''''Detect weapons''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Haela Brightaxe]]. A version named '''''detect weaponry''''' was a spell, which was more broadly available.<ref name=CS/>

==Effects==
When cast, the caster was capable of detecting the presence of weapons. The detection area was up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} in front of the caster, with a width of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. The spell could not penetrate barriers or walls that were too thick. The caster could not detect weapons on the other side of a stone wall that was more than {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} thick, nor a wooden wall more than {{SI|1|yd|c|long=yes}} thick. A metal barrier of just {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} or more in width blocked the spell.

The spell was capable of detecting weapons concealed with magic such as ''[[invisibility]]''. It could also detect an object that was used as an improvised weapon. It could detect damaged weapons but only if they were still functional. There was also a small chance the caster was capable of detecting the exact kind of weapon. To hide from the spell an opponent needed to cast spells like ''[[secret weapon]]'' on the weapon itself, or ''[[nondetection]]'' on their person.<ref name=CS/>

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the holy symbol of Haela Brightaxe.
