Detect weapons was a spell used by clerics of Haela Brightaxe. A version named detect weaponry was a spell, which was more broadly available.
When cast, the caster was capable of detecting the presence of weapons. The detection area was up to  in front of the caster, with a width of . The spell could not penetrate barriers or walls that were too thick. The caster could not detect weapons on the other side of a stone wall that was more than  thick, nor a wooden wall more than  thick. A metal barrier of just  or more in width blocked the spell.
The spell was capable of detecting weapons concealed with magic such as invisibility. It could also detect an object that was used as an improvised weapon. It could detect damaged weapons but only if they were still functional. There was also a small chance the caster was capable of detecting the exact kind of weapon. To hide from the spell an opponent needed to cast spells like secret weapon on the weapon itself, or nondetection on their person.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Haela Brightaxe.
