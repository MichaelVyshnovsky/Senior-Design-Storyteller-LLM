        "mainbody": "'''''Burning blade''''' is among the most complex [[spell]]s learned by [[swordmage]] initiates and is used most commonly by those who invoke the [[Swordmage#Assault Swordmage|assault]] style of [[arcane magic|arcane]] swordplay. When a swordmage casts ''burning blade'' he or she [[transmutation|transmutes]] their sword's surface into flames, making it more deadly upon contact with the flesh of a swordmage's foe. The initial power of the spell is largely determined by a swordmage's intellect but the effect of the spell can continue for up to several minutes, during which time the intensity of the flames is dependent instead upon the swordmage's physical strength. ''Burning blade'' is fairly difficult to cast and, as such, can only be used once per day.",
