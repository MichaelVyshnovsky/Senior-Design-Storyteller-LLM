        "mainbody": "Leaf into dagger was a divine alteration spell that transformed a single leaf into a dagger that could be wielded by the cleric.\nWhen cast, this spell transformed a single leaf, taken from a plant of any species, into an unbreakable, non-metallic dagger. It was exceptionally sharp, didnt reflect light, and possessed a +2 enchantment.\nThe dagger immediately disappeared if it was intentionally let go by the casting cleric or if thrown as a projectile weapon.\nThe specifications of leaf into dagger were inscribed upon one of the \"inner petals\" of the Chauntean relic, the Glarathra.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast, along with a single leaf taken from any plant."
