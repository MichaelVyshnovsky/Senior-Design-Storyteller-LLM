        "mainbody": "Glowglory was a spell unique to dwarven clerics.\nWhen this spell was cast upon a normal stone it caused the affected item to radiate a continual light and emit a mild degree of heat. This latter effect was known to be useful in staving off the affects of exposure in cold climates.\nWhen cast upon a glowstone, this spell caused a bright beam of radiant force to be unleashed from it. This beam could be directed by the caster as either a continuous or pulsating stream. It was capable of cutting through all manner of wood, stone, and even flesh.  Though this beam could be used offensively as a weapon, it was often used to quarry or create passages within solid stone.\nThe effects of glowglory would cease upon the caster dying, falling unconscious, or casting another spell.\nA cleric needed either a glowstone or a regular stone to cast the spell upon. They also required a pinch of either gold-dust or gem-dust."
