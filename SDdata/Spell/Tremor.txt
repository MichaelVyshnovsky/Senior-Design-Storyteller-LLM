'''''Tremor''''' was a destructive [[spell]] from the [[transmutation]] [[school of magic]], used by some [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s and and granted by [[Talos]] to his [[Stormlord]]s.

==Effects==
The ''tremor'' spell was only limited by the caster's eyesight. The spell was virtually instantaneous to cast, and once activated, it generated a localized ''tremor'' that wrenched the soil and ground within its area of effect. The ground was ripped and torn, while all those who were not quick enough â€“ were crushed and bludgeoned by rocks and soil. Those who received the spell's full punishment also were knocked out for 18 seconds.
