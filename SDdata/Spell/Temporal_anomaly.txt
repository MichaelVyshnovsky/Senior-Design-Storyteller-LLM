When cast, this spell created ripple in time. It caused physical effects without a physical cause. For example, the caster could cause a [[Throwing knife|throwing dagger]] to appear in a target's chest as out of nowhere. While casting, the caster actually enters an alternate timestream where they committed the desired action.
