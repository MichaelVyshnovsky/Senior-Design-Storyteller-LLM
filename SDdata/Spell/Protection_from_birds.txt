Protection from birds was a spell unique to Halruaa.
This spell protected the caster from birds, or creatures that had feathers. Weaker birds were completely blocked from being able to attack the caster when they approached. Birds of medium strength found it more difficult to actually hit the caster. The strongest birds were not affected by this spell.
This spell required a bird feather to cast. If a feather from a roc or giant eagle was used, then spells duration was doubled.
