'''''Protection from birds''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
This spell protected the caster from birds, or creatures that had feathers. Weaker birds were completely blocked from being able to attack the caster when they approached. Birds of medium strength found it more difficult to actually hit the caster. The strongest birds were not affected by this spell.

==Components==
This spell required a bird feather to cast. If a feather from a [[roc]] or [[giant eagle]] was used, then spell's duration was doubled.
