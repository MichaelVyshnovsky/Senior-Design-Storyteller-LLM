'''Greyspace''' was the [[crystal sphere]] that contained the planet [[Oerth]] and the other planets of its system. Unlike [[Realmspace]], which had [[the sun]] as the sphere's primary celestial body, Oerth was Greyspace's primary, sitting at the center of the sphere and orbited by its sun and other planets.

==Geography==
Greyspace was part of a triangular configuration in the flow of the [[phlogiston]] that also included Realmspace and [[Krynnspace]]. The flow allowed two-way [[spelljammer]] travel between Realmspace and Greyspace, as well as one-way travel from Greyspace to Krynnspace.
