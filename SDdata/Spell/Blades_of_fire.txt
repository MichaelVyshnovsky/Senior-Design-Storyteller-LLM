'''''Blades of fire''''' was an [[arcane]] and [[divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] from the first circles of magic that lit a weapon aflame. The spell could be used by [[ranger]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[warmage]]s.

==Effects==
After uttering the spell's words, the caster touched a target weapon that immediately became sheathed in flames. The fire did not damage the wielder or caster, nor the weapon itself, but dealt additional fiery damage to the targets of the weapon's attacks. The spell could be cast on a weapon that already possessed other [[item enchantment]]s, making them even more deadly.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]].
