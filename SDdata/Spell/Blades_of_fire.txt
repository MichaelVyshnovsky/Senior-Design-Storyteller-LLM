Blades of fire was an arcane and divine conjuration spell from the first circles of magic that lit a weapon aflame. The spell could be used by rangers, sorcerers, wizards, and warmages.
After uttering the spells words, the caster touched a target weapon that immediately became sheathed in flames. The fire did not damage the wielder or caster, nor the weapon itself, but dealt additional fiery damage to the targets of the weapons attacks. The spell could be cast on a weapon that already possessed other item enchantments, making them even more deadly.
The spell required only a verbal component.
