Gem tracer was a powerful spell commonly used by dragons. 
This spell was used to create a permanent link to an object or item by using a focus. The focus acted like a locate object spell but with unlimited range. It also allowed the creature holding the focus to scry the enspelled object. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a focus, a gem with a value of 100 gp or more.
According to legend, this spell was created by the dragon whose hoard was first raided.
