'''''Spider climb''''', sometimes known as ''spiderwalk'' or ''spider scuttle'', was a [[transmutation]] spell used by [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s, [[wizard]]s and some [[druid]]s. It was also an [[invocation]] used by some [[warlock]]s, particularly those of the [[Warlock#Dark Pact Warlock|dark pact]].

==Effects==

When cast, ''spider climb'' allowed its caster to walk along the walls of a cavern like a [[spider]], giving them shadowy legs that allowed them to move with unnatural ease and speed. ''Spider scuttle'' was a somewhat complex spell, but warlocks required only a short rest between castings in order to regain the power necessary to cast it again.

Prior to the [[Spellplague]] and after the [[Second Sundering]], ''spider scuttle'' was more commonly known as ''spider climb'', and was usable by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s as well as warlocks. For the former two, ''spider climb'' was like any other spell, the number of castings allowed dependent upon a degree of preparation by the wizard or power of the sorcerer. [[Druid]]s also used a similar [[evocation]].

The duration of the spell could be doubled by consuming a potion made from powdered [[datchas]].

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and material components. The materials required were a drop of [[bitumen]] and a live [[spider]],

==History==

The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Quantoul]] in {{Yearlink|-2027}} and was originally called '''''Quantoul's climber'''''.
