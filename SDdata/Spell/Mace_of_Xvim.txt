Mace of Xvim was a divine evocation spell used by priests devoted to Iyachtu Xvim, enabling them to conjure an enchanted mace.
This spell created a weightless glowing mace for the caster to wield. The force behind the mace could easily shatter objects. The mace would vanish if it left the casters hand for any reason.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a fragment of iron, steel, or silver to cast.
