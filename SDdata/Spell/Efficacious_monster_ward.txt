'''''Efficacious monster ward''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that could keep some undesirable creatures out of a large area<ref group="note">The source states the area of effect in two different ways. In the spell summary it says "10-foot cube/level" but in the spell description it says "a cubic area whose sides equal the caster's level times 10 feet", and gives an example calculation. Using the second definition, a 10th level priest could ward a million cubic feet, a volume almost as big as the [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070519114542AAxtdWo Washington Monument]. for a few minutes.The duration is given as one minute per level which seems very short compared to the weaker ''[[antivermin barrier]]'' which has a duration of one hour per level.

This spell require a pinch of salt in addition to verbal and somatic components.
