Sentry of Helm was a divine conjuration spell used by priests devoted to Helm, enabling them to aid in guard duty.
This spell created a shapeless face that assisted in guard duty while others were sleeping. The caster sprinkled sand around a  perimeter while casting this spell then promptly fell asleep. The conjured sentry would wake the caster if any visible object not present when the spell was cast larger than  in length crossed the perimeter. This would also end the spell, but the caster would awaken alert and knowledgeable that something had crossed the perimeter. Sentries conjured by a caster with a degree of skill also had infravision to aid them.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a small bag of fine sand to cast.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , Chief Prelate Dayspring of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff declared it illegal for priests to cast Sentry of Helm within the city due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm, threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.
