}}'''''Ship of fools''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell had similar effects of the ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell, but instead of targeting [[wizard]]s, this spell made an entire ship's crew lose their knowledge of the sea.

Any naval action attempted by a crew member under the influence of this spell would fail.

This spell could only affect one sailing vessel at a time.

==Components==
This spell required a finger bone or nonmagical ring taken from someone who lived a good life to cast. This component was reusable.
