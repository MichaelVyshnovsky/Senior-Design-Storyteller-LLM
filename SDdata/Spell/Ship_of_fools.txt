Ship of fools was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell had similar effects of the feeblemind spell, but instead of targeting wizards, this spell made an entire ships crew lose their knowledge of the sea.
Any naval action attempted by a crew member under the influence of this spell would fail.
This spell could only affect one sailing vessel at a time.
This spell required a finger bone or nonmagical ring taken from someone who lived a good life to cast. This component was reusable.
