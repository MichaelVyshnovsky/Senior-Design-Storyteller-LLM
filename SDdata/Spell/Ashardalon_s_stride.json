        "mainbody": "Ashardalons stride was a spell used by artificers, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards to increase their speed. \nWhen cast, this spell caused flames to burst from the feet of the caster, which massively increased their speed and allowed them to move unrestricted. Anyone who got too close to the caster while this spell was active would likely be burned. \nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
