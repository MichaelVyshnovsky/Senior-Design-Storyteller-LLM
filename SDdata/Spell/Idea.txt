Idea was a divination spell that monks could use to gain a burst of inspiration toward solving a problem.
This spell induced a clarity of thought in the caster that could be used to prompt a memory of a forgotten detail or overlooked clue that was relevant to solving a conundrum. This spell had a cool-down period of six hours before it could be cast again.
One gold piece was required to cast this spell, in addition to verbal and somatic components.
