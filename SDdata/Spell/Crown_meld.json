        "Effects": "This spell would link a series of preexisting fusions, such as those created by ''[[Merald's meld]]'', in items that were composed of four or more substances. This new shell was considered completely whole, continuous and flawless and ready to receive ''dweomers'' from ''[[focal stone]]s'' or existing enchanted items.",
        "Components": "The material components for this spell were a thumb-sized lump of resin, an [[iron]] nail, a strand of [[spider silk]], paste made from legumes and a flawless diamond, worth at least 2000 [[gp]]."
