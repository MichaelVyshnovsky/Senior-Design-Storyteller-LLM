        "mainbody": "Shadow well was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.\nWhen cast, this spell caused a targeted creatures shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the Plane of Shadow. The targeted creature then fell into this pocket realm. Within, it was a desolate place filled with phantasms made from shadow. These phantasms would pursue and mock the creature, but did not cause any physical harm. The only way for a creature to escape the pocket realm was with a plane shift spell. Once the spell expired, the targeted creature was returned to the location they were in when the spell was cast, filled with fear and dread.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
