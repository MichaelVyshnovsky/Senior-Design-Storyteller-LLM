        "Effects": "Upon completion of the casting, the spellcaster fell immediately into a deep sleep for several minutes; the ultimate duration of the sleep depending on the power of the caster. While the caster's body slept, her or his spirit left the body behind and traveled incorporeally.\n\nIn this spirit form, the caster could see and hear as normal but otherwise behaved as a spirit or [[ghost]] and could not interact with the material world. If moving continuously, the caster could traverse a distance of a 1,000 feet (300 meters) each minute. The scenes seen by the sleeping caster were events occurring in the present, never those of the past or future.\n\nWhen the duration of the spell ended or if the sleeping body was disturbed in any way, the spirit of the caster immediately returned to the body, and the caster woke up from the dream.\n\nThe spell took a full six seconds to cast and could not be cast within the [[phlogiston]] between the [[crystal sphere]]s.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[somatic component]]s and either a [[material component]] or [[divine focus]]. Shamans casting the spell used a stick of [[incense]] during the casting. ''Dream sight'' did not require [[verbal component]]s."
