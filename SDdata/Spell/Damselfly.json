        "mainbody": "A '''damselfly''' was a [[spelljammer]] similar in design to a [[Dragonfly (spelljammer)|dragonfly]], but including several modifications that resulted in a sturdier vessel that could operate with a much smaller crew.",
        "Description": "The damselfly's hull was made of enameled metal. All its decks were covered, including a weapon compartment behind the wings that had a sliding hatch, which could be opened to reveal a single heavy weapon (typically a [[ballista]], a [[catapult]] or a [[jettison]]).\n\nThe ship's efficient wing design allowed it to be operated by an extremely small crew: only two people were required to crew a damselfly. The ship could hold a compliment of up to ten creatures without compromising its air supply. This trait made damselflies the favorite choice of hermits and smugglers, as well as solitary monsters such as [[rakshasa]]s and [[lich]]es.\n\nDamselflies could be modified to suit a variety of purposes. Some had the cargo compartment converted to carry a second weapon, while others had the [[spelljamming helm]] replaced by a non-magical engine in order to operate like a shuttle and carry out landings and short-range reconnaissance missions. Other changes sometimes consisted of heavier hull armoring and the use of different materials.",
        "History": "In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], damselflies were being tested by [[mind flayer]] crews as a possible addition to their spelljamming fleets. The ships possessed qualities that illithids valued, such as covered decks and a safe, sturdy structure.\n\nDamselflies were used as support vessels in the Imperial [[Radole]] Navy, charged with protecting the planet and challenging any approaching vessels."
