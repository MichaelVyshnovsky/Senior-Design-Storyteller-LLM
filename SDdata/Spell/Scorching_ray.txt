Scorching ray was a low-powered evocation spell that blasted opponents with rays of fire.
Upon successfully completing the spell, the caster aimed his or her hands at a target or multiple targets within close range and projected a number of fiery bolts. The number of rays increased with the power of the caster the most powerful casters were said to have been capable of shooting three such rays with a single casting. Whatever the number, the flaming bolts were fired simultaneously and were limited to striking targets no more than ten yards (nine meters) away from each other.
The spell simply required verbal and somatic components.
