Abeyance was an alteration spell that delayed the release of magical effects from magical items.
This spell had two major effects, depending on its use. If abeyance was cast on a focal stone with a stored spell inside, it would delay its release, or transference, up to months or years, until otherwise altered by another spell or destroyed outright. If the focal stone was affected by dweomerflow, wondrous web or holy vesting the spell within would dissipate or be transferred to another spell-storing object. Destruction of the stone would negate the abeyance and cause the spell to immediately take effect.
If abeyance was cast by a mage or priest while touching a non-artifact magical item, it would temporarily delay the released effect upon the items next activation.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
