'''''Summon monster I''''', or '''''monster summoning I''''', (originally called '''''Lucke's 1{{st}} monster summons''''') was one of the series of ''[[summon monster]]'' spells available to spellcasters.

[[Cleric]]s whose gods had an interest in [[portal]]s, such as [[Eilistraee]] and [[Shaundakul]], often prayed for this spell.

==Effects==
This spell functioned just as all ''summon monster'' spells. It could summon a [[badger]], [[dog]], [[giant fire beetle]], [[monkey]], [[owl]], or [[porpoise]] from one of the [[celestial planes]] or a [[dire rat]], [[hawk]], medium-sized [[monstrous centipede]], small [[monstrous scorpion]], small [[monstrous spider]], [[octopus]], [[raven]], or small [[viper]] from one of the [[fiendish planes]].

The best-known version prior to the {{yearlinkName|1372}} summoned different beings, in a number from two to eight.{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|377}} In salt water, it could summon instead small [[barracuda]]s, common [[lamprey]]s, [[merfolk]], sea [[otter]]s, or black [[urchin]]s. It could also summon up to a dozen [[piranha]]s. In fresh water, its possible summons were [[giant frog]]s, [[koalinth]]s, common [[lamprey]]s, common [[otter]]s, or up to a dozen [[nixie]]s or [[piranha]]s.{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|378}}

==History==
This was the first ''summon monster'' spell developed by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Lucke]]. He completed it in {{Yearlink|-1994}}.
