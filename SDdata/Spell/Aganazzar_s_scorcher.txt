Aganazzars scorcher was an arcane evocation spell that created a destructive jet of flame.
Aganazzars scorcher was created by the wizard Aganazzar. This spell was originally known to have been inscribed on the first page of the Tome of the Covenant, a spellbook created by the four founders of the Covenant, and Aganazzar was known to have given the spell to his apprentices.
The church of Kossuth managed by 1374 DR to convert this spell into one that clerics who were introduced to their faiths secrets could cast.
The Red Wizards also got their hands on it and were known to use it shortly after Aganazzars death. It saw widespread use by the Red Wizards of Thay and battle mages across Faer√ªn.
The spell was known among elven mages, who were known to craft magic rings of fire with it included with command word of fete, meaning "fire". One of these rings was used by Dorigen Kel Lamond to cause havoc in Shilmista and, after taking it from Dorigen, Cadderly Bonaduce later used the same ring to slay the assassin Ghost.
This spell was found in the pamphlet Volos Guide to All Things Magical, published in 1359 DR.
Magelord Rimmen of the Scarlet Eye, the sun elf wizard Meraera, the energetic explorer known as Xara Tantlor, the Moonstar Kyriani Agrivar, Gromph Baenre, and Pharaun Mizzrym knew how to cast this spell.
