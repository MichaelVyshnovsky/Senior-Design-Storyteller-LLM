        "mainbody": "Permanent image, also known as permanent illusion, was an arcane illusion spell that conjured an illusion more convincing than its lesser image cousins.\nThis spell functioned in the same manner as silent image, but in addition to providing an image it also included elements of sound, smell and temperature. Furthermore, its duration was unlimited. The caster could let the image move while concentrating, otherwise it remained still.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, permanent image required a material component a small piece of fleece and jade powder of a value of 100 gold pieces in the casting.\nThe spell was credited to the Netherese arcanist Toscudlo in  and was originally called Toscudlos permanent illusion."
