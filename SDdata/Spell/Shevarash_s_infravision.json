        "mainbody": "'''''Shevarash's infravision''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Shevarash]].",
        "Effects": "This spell gave the caster or targeted creature the ability to see clearly in normal darkness without any light. The maximum distance one could see clearly was {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. A downside of this spell was that, while it was in effect, bright sources of light, such as [[lantern]]s and [[torch|torches]], could temporarily blind the recipient. This spell was unable to detect invisible creatures.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Shevarash and a pinch of dried [[carrot]]. A single [[agate]] was also an acceptable material component."
