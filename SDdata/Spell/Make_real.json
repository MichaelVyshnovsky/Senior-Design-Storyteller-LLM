        "mainbody": "Make real was an alteration spell that allowed a cleric to make permanent any magical alterations that had been placed upon an object. It was one of several spells created by the Balance of Belaros, a holy relic to the Church of Tyr.\nWhen this spell was cast, it made permanent any spells or magical effects that were imbued into an item, such as a weapon or tool.\nMake real was used by clerics of Tyr to create various magic items for their temples. Alternately, it was used by Tyrran clergy to \"modify\" the properties of those they sought to punish.\nTyr looked poorly on his priests that used this spell in a trivial manner.\nThe casting of make real required verbal, somatic, and material components."
