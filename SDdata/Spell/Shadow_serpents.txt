Shadow serpents was a spell that created shadow-like serpents.
When cast, the caster weaved together a multitude of shadow-like serpents. These serpents were ephemeral, existing solely as manifestations of darkness. Each individual shadow serpent possessed a degree of autonomy and could only be dispelled by magic such as dispel magic or by exposing them to direct, unobstructed bright light with no surrounding shadows or darkness within a  radius of their current location. The spell could create a maximum of one hundred shadow serpents at a time.
Shadow serpents lacked intelligence, life, and physical form, rendering them incapable of attacking or defending. They aimlessly flitted about within areas of shadow or total darkness, attentively observing their surroundings. Without direction, they congregated in a fixed location, typically forming a circular or spherical cluster with a radius of approximately .
The caster had the ability to command their horde of serpents as a collective entity, but not individually.
Furthermore, the spell allowed the caster to scry upon a scene from a remote location through the countless eyes of their shadow serpents. This scrying had an unlimited range as long as it remained within the same plane of existence. However, due to the shifting and overlapping nature of the serpents observations, it became challenging to comprehend the visual information obtained.
This spell only required a verbal component.
The shadow dragon Aurgloroasa was known to use shadow serpents.
