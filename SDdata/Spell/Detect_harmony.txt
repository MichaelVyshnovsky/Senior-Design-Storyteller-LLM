'''''Detect disease''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell gave a shugenja vague knowledge on the balance of forces in an area. Forces such as chaotic, evil, good or lawful were detectable. The spell did not reveal the alignment of any creature or item in the area of effect of the spell. If the spell was cast directly on a creature, the spell revealed vague information about their [[alignment]] and past deeds. The spell could also be cast on a building, which revealed whether the building was a holy place or occupied by spirits.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a scroll of sutras. This scroll had to cost at least 5 [[ch'ien]].
