        "mainbody": "'''''Fist of Gond''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that was available to the [[church of Gond|Gondsmen]] of [[Faerûn]]. It was an extremely rare spell, even among the faithful of [[Gond]] in [[Lantan]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell encased the caster's arms in a field of force energy. This energy field granted the cleric tremendous strength, comparable to that of a [[fire giant]].<ref group=\"note\">[[Prayers from the Faithful]] lists in an increase to the caster's strength at a level that was equivalent to [[fire giant]]s, as per the item ''[[girdle of giant strength]]'' as listed in the [[Dungeon Master's Guide 2nd edition|DMG 2e]]. Their punches increased in power and they were capable of punching through [[armor]] or stone with ease. The caster's body was protected from any stress or damage that came as a result of the extraneous force.\n\nThe duration of the spell lasted for just over half a minute.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell existed within certain select [[book]]s in some holy Gondar libraries scattered across [[Faerûn]]. One of these tomes, ''[[The Argyr]]'', only revealed the secrets of its casting upon the utterance of the secret names of Gond, spoken in a correct order. Upon the correct delivery, illuminated appeared at the top of the tome's last page, outlining how ''fist of Gond'' could be cast.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''Fist of Gond'' required a solid [[adamantine]] cube, no side of which was shorter than 1\" (2.5 cm) in length, and a [[diamond]] worth no less than 500 [[gp]]."
