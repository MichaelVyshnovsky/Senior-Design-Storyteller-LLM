        "mainbody": "Fist of Gond was an evocation spell that was available to the Gondsmen of Faerûn. It was an extremely rare spell, even among the faithful of Gond in Lantan.\nWhen cast, this spell encased the casters arms in a field of force energy. This energy field granted the cleric tremendous strength, comparable to that of a fire giant.Prayers from the Faithful lists in an increase to the casters strength at a level that was equivalent to fire giants, as per the item girdle of giant strength as listed in the DMG 2e. Their punches increased in power and they were capable of punching through armor or stone with ease. The casters body was protected from any stress or damage that came as a result of the extraneous force.\nThe duration of the spell lasted for just over half a minute.\nThe specifications of this spell existed within certain select books in some holy Gondar libraries scattered across Faerûn. One of these tomes, The Argyr, only revealed the secrets of its casting upon the utterance of the secret names of Gond, spoken in a correct order. Upon the correct delivery, illuminated appeared at the top of the tomes last page, outlining how fist of Gond could be cast.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, Fist of Gond required a solid adamantine cube, no side of which was shorter than 1\" (2.5 cm) in length, and a diamond worth no less than 500 gp."
