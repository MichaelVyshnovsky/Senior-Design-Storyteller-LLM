        "mainbody": "'''''Skywrite''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that created a short message composed of clouds in the sky.",
        "Effects": "The spell created a stationary message that appeared to be made of clouds and consisted of up to ten words at any point in the sky within sight. The message lasted for up to 1 hour, unless a strong wind dissipated the clouds early.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "''Skywrite'' was among the spells contained in the last chapter of ''[[Myrl's Text]]'', written some time in the [[12th century]] [[DR]]. There was some indiction that this chapter was not written by the wizard [[Myrl]] alone, and it remained unclear if the spell was his creation.<ref>"
