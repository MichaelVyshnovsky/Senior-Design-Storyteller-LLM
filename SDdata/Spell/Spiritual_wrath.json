        "mainbody": "Spiritual wrath was a cooperative evocation spell that brought down a mighty blow able to smash objects, creatures, and buildings alike.\nBetween six and twelve priests were required to cast this spell and it cost them sorely to do so. All casters had to be within a 15 ft (4.6 m) radius circle for their efforts to combine. Before casting, the priests had to agree on the area of effect. The minimum area was a circle of radius 60 ft (18.3) with each additional priest increasing the radius by 10 ft (3.1 m) up to the maximum radius of 120 ft (36.6 m). The center of the area of destruction could be up to 300 yd (274 m) away from the center of the casting circle. Additional priests also increased the average damage done by spiritual wrath.\nWhen cast, a great wave of force like a gargantuan hammer came down from above and crushed the target area. All creatures in the area of effect had a chance to partially resist the spell, but not objects or structures, so the destruction was great. Building and structures were smashed as if they had been hit by a heavy catapult. Depending on the composition of the target area, it was likely obscured by a large cloud of dust for a few minutes afterward.\nThe effort to cast this spell caused each participating caster to suffer a loss of health on the order of a critical wound. There was no way to avoid this cost.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The casting had to be done simultaneously by all priests in proximity to each other as described above."
