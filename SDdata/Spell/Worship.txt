Worship was an uncommon spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell increased the natural charisma of the caster. Weak-willed creatures who had a clear view of the caster fell to their knees and worshiped the caster. Use of this spell to impersonate a deity was incredibly dangerous. 
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
