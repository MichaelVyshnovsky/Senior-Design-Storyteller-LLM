'''''Stormrage''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[evocation]] [[spell]] that granted an individual storm-related powers for a short duration of time.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, a [[cleric]] was able to imbue themself or another individual a number of powers for matter of seconds. The affected person was granted the ability of flight, immunity to magical and mundane lightning along with resilience to strong gusts of wind. Additionally, a person in a ''storm rage'' was able to discharge pairs of ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' every few seconds.

The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the [[Talassan]] [[relic]], the ''[[Chanting Chain]]''.

In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''stormrage'' required a number of [[material component]]s, including: a feather taken from a bird capable of flight, a single piece of flint and a small amount of ash taken from any living being that had been struck by lightning.
