        "mainbody": "'''''Final struggle''''' was a contingency [[evocation]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] of the 8{{th}} circle of magic used by evil [[wizard]]s to avoid a certain demise and take over a new body.",
        "Effects": "After the spell was prepared and cast, it remained dormant until the caster was killed. Just like the ''[[contingency]]'' spell, it activated in a specific circumstanceâ€”the caster's death. Once they passed, the caster's spirit lingered in the area where their dead body was found. This spirit had one chance at returning to life: through a single use of a ''[[magic jar]]'' spell ingrained in their mind after the transformation into a spirit. The ''magic jar'' spell could be cast at any sentient creature within a distance of {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}}, or more if the caster was more powerful. If ''magic jar'' was successful, then the spirit immediately gained full possession of the victim, while the victim's life force was forcefully ejected and lost. In case the target resisted the ''magic jar'' spell, the necromancer simply died and went on into their [[afterlife]].\n\nMost successful castings of the ''final struggle'' were acts of true [[evil]] and turned any [[good]]- and [[neutral]]-aligned wizard towards a life of malice and destruction. However, in some rare cases that fate was avoided, for example, if the possessed sentient creature was hollow or fully willing to sacrifice themselves for the caster.",
        "Components": "The spell called for [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s worth at least 1,600 [[gp]] that were consumed by the casting. The spell was prepared and incanted over a period of eight hours.",
        "History": "The ''final struggle'' spells were foul works of evil and were used by villainous [[necromancer]]s who were enemies of the [[Harper]]s. The knowledge of the spell was deemed dangerous and a copy of the spell was hidden away in one of the many secret Harper vaults. Being a [[bard]]ic organization, they were unwilling to destroy knowledge, even such vile and evil knowledge. Harpers elected to hide the wondrous items and dark magics away and keep them under lock and key."
