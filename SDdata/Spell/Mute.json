        "mainbody": "Mute (in the sense of \"mutate\") was a legerdemain cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It was an analog of the change cantrip that worked on minerals, temporarily altering the shape of a small object, or changing one mineral into another.\nThis cantrip operated on minerals in a fashion similar to how change worked on animals or vegetables. The target had to be palm-sized or smaller, and be of a mineral nature, such as glass, stone, metal, etc. Examples of possible mutations included changing a coin into a ring, a sheet of foil into a rod, or a piece of broken glass into a crystal. This spell could also change one substance into another somewhat similar substance, such as lead into silver or copper into gold. The change lasted for one minute but could be dispelled if someone other than the caster examined the object by touching it and successfully resisted the dweomer.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast in the same fashion as change. The caster passed a hand over the target object and uttered a magic word."
