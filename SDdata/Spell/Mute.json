        "mainbody": "'''''Mute''''' (in the sense of \"mutate\") was a legerdemain [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was an analog of the ''[[change]]'' cantrip that worked on minerals, temporarily altering the shape of a small object, or changing one mineral into another.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip operated on minerals in a fashion similar to how ''change'' worked on animals or vegetables. The target had to be palm-sized or smaller, and be of a mineral nature, such as glass, stone, metal, ''etc.'' Examples of possible mutations included changing a coin into a ring, a sheet of foil into a rod, or a piece of broken glass into a crystal. This spell could also change one substance into another somewhat similar substance, such as lead into [[silver]] or [[copper]] into [[gold]]. The change lasted for one minute but could be dispelled if someone other than the caster examined the object by touching it and successfully resisted the dweomer.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast in the same fashion as ''change''. The caster passed a hand over the target object and uttered a magic word."
