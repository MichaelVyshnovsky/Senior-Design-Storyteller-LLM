        "mainbody": "'''Know School''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] known to the [[magic]]-using community in [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Effects": "By means of this spell, a curious [[mage]] could find out the [[Schools of Magic|school]] another wizard specialized in, if any. This was mainly used to determine if a spell caster was a genuine representative of, or expert in, his or her school of magic. Nothing was learned if the target was not a specialist in their school, or was a [[priest]], or had no spell casting ability. This spell could be cast on a subject without them noticing, but most mages would be offended if they found out they were being spied upon.",
        "Usage": "The [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] found this spell invaluable, and regularly cast it before dealing with other wizards with whom they were not familiar.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were necessary for the casting of ''know school'', as well as a small tube made of [[paper]] or [[vellum]].",
