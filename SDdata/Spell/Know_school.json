        "mainbody": "Know School was a divination spell known to the magic-using community in Faer√ªn.\nBy means of this spell, a curious mage could find out the school another wizard specialized in, if any. This was mainly used to determine if a spell caster was a genuine representative of, or expert in, his or her school of magic. Nothing was learned if the target was not a specialist in their school, or was a priest, or had no spell casting ability. This spell could be cast on a subject without them noticing, but most mages would be offended if they found out they were being spied upon.\nThe Red Wizards of Thay found this spell invaluable, and regularly cast it before dealing with other wizards with whom they were not familiar.\nVerbal and somatic components were necessary for the casting of know school, as well as a small tube made of paper or vellum.\nCategoryDivination spells\nCategoryWizard spells\n9i7ox0kxdwf870s9whuo4sblvcqd1qy"
