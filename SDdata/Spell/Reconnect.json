        "mainbody": "Reconnect was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was a closely guarded secret weapon used by members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nWizards used this spell to re-attune themselves to their magical powers after spellslaying. The reconnection lasted for the spells duration. If the wizard performed a spellslaying that kept them from casting spells longer than the reconnection spells duration, then the wizard would not be able to cast spells after the reconnection spell ended.\nThis spell did not require physical components to cast."
