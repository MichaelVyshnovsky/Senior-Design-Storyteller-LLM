'''''Whisper blade''''' was an [[evocation]] [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell created a translucent force that extended from one of the caster's hands in the shape of a [[longsword]]. A spellcaster wielding a ''whisper blade'' did so as a proficient warrior and not a feeble mage. These magic blades never grew dull and could not be damaged regardless of what happened to them. The blade could not be taken from the caster's hand by another, nor could the caster be forced to drop the blade. However, the caster could dismiss the blade with only a thought whenever they wanted.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.

==History==
Many [[mage]]s would whisper the incantation to activate this spell in order to surprise others, leading to the spell's name.
