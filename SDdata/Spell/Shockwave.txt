'''''Shockwave''''' was an [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Perfected Map that used [[truespeak]] to induce the air to push all targets to their feet.

==Usage==
Through the ''shockwave'' utterance, all those within a {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} radius of a given point were pushed off-balance, likely into the ground, by the air. The effects lasted a few seconds.

==History==
The recitation was known to [[word archon]]s and [[loquasphinx]]es.
