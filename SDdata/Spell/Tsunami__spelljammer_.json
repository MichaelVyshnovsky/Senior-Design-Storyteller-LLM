        "mainbody": "The '''tsunami''' were enormous serpentine-shaped [[spelljammer]]s, designed and operated by [[human]]s from [[Wa]]. They were the largest ships constructed in [[Realmspace]].",
        "Description": "Tsunami were huge centipede-looking flying ships. They moved through air and space in a winding and graceful motion and were also capable of moving on solid ground on leg-looking appendages in order to reach protective bunkers.\n\nThe decks were constantly illuminated by ''[[continual light]]'' spells, which served as a scare tactic for enemies and also illuminated the gardens designed to increase the ship's autonomy.\n\nEach ship carried in its cargo hold a compliment of 36 [[Locust (spelljammer)|locust]]s, which were commonly referred to as a \"plague\".\n\nThe ship had enough room and air to support a crew of 200 individuals for up to ten months, but could support almost twice as many if needed. The large crew, required to operate the ship's [[Spelljamming helm|helm]], its numerous weapons, and its compliment of locusts, was held under a strict hierarchy.",
        "History": "Wa's fleet of tsunami was developed and built over the course of a decade in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The ships were developed as a reaction to [[Shou Lung]] and [[elven]] presence in space, as the Wa government feared an invasion by either of those forces. During the early period of Wa spelljammer development, many elven raiders stole and stripped Wa ships in order to use their helms to power their [[flitter]]s. To prevent further stealing of their helms, Wa developed the [[ki-helm]], which could not be used by elves at the time. The large tsunami were developed to match the elven [[armada (spelljammer)|armada]]s and [[Man-o-war|men-o-war]], basically emulating the armada's capability of carrying flitters.\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century DR, six tsunami existed, of which only two were deployed at any given time."
