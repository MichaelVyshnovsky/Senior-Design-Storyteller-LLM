'''''Erupt''''' was a [[divine]] [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that caused a massive eruption of lava to spew forth from the ground, at a location of the caster's choosing.

==Effects==
The burst of molten earth encompassed an area hundreds of feet in diameter. Those caught within the molten eruption were severely burned, caught fire and, if they were wearing [[armor|metal armor]], were seared as if they were affected by the ''[[heat metal]]'' spell. The effects of the spell were catastrophic on the face of [[Toril]]; the land beneath the eruption was left charred and incapable of supporting natural life for a year's time.
