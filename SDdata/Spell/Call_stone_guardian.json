        "mainbody": "'''''Call stone guardian''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priest]]s of [[Segojan Earthcaller]], Earthfriend. It created a [[stone guardian]] out of solid rock that did the bidding of the caster until the spell expired.",
        "Effects": "This spell required a special pure [[quartz]] rod, crafted over the course of ten days and having a value of not less than 1,000 [[gold piece]]s. The rod was used to control the stone guardian, allowing the caster to give the creature simple commands. The priest had to touch a block of solid stone at least {{SI|3000|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight, and the spell lasted for at least 90 minutes (longer for more experienced casters). The crystal rod shattered into worthless shards when the spell expired. The spell also ended if the rod was prematurely broken.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a fine rock crystal rod crafted as described above. The priest's [[holy symbol]] was also required in the casting."
