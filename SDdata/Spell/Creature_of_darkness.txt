Creature of darkness was a divine alteration and illusion spell used by priests devoted to Shar, enabling them to create a human-shaped field of magical darkness.
This spell created a vaguely human-shaped field of magical darkness that quenched magical light and continual light on contact. The caster controlled the creature and could perceive the creatures surroundings. The creature of darkness could not interact with physical objects. Living creatures could walk into the creature of darkness and cloak themselves in its shadows. If the caster did this they could use the magic to levitate or feather fall for up to four minutes.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pinch of soot, a strand of spider web, and a bit of black fur or down from a flying creature to cast.
