'''''Creature of darkness''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Shar]], enabling them to create a [[human]]-shaped field of magical darkness.

==Effects==
This spell created a vaguely human-shaped field of magical darkness that quenched magical ''[[light]]'' and ''[[continual light]]'' on contact. The caster controlled the creature and could perceive the creature's surroundings. The ''creature of darkness'' could not interact with physical objects. Living creatures could walk into the ''creature of darkness'' and cloak themselves in its shadows. If the caster did this they could use the magic to ''[[levitate]]'' or ''[[feather fall]]'' for up to four minutes.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pinch of soot, a strand of [[spider]] web, and a bit of black fur or down from a flying creature to cast.
