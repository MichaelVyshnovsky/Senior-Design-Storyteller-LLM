        "mainbody": "Shadowcloak was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Mask, enabling them to cloak themselves in fog.\nThis spell created a semisolid fog around the caster or a touched target that obscured them from sight. The shadowcloak moved with the target and made it difficult to identify them in direct sunlight. However, the target was practically invisible at night or under heavy shadows. The shadowcloak also confused any attackers with its swirling haze, making it more difficult for them to strike the target. All sounds from the target were muffled as well, regardless of whether or not they wanted to be heard. Normal and magical light sources were not affected by a shadowcloak, but they also did not cause the shadow to dissipate. The targets visibility was not hindered while within a shadowcloak.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
