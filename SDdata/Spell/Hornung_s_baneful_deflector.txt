Hornungs baneful deflector was a wild magic evocation spell used by wild mages. This spell was developed by Hornung, a mage originally from Toril.
This spell partially surrounded the caster in a shimmering hemisphere of transparent force that moved with the caster. The hemisphere served to protect the caster against magical and non-magical missile attacks targeted specifically at them, but it did not protect against explosions from nearby missile attacks.
When a missile struck the baneful defelctor it would deflect and randomly strike a different living target within . The original target was a possible target for this random deflection. If the original target was struck by the deflection then the spell would instantly fail.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small prism to cast. The prism was shattered during the casting.
