'''''Hornung's baneful deflector''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s. This spell was developed by [[Hornung]], a mage originally from [[Toril]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993 rare set|22|[[Hornung|Hornung the Anarch]]}}

==Effects==
This spell partially surrounded the caster in a shimmering hemisphere of transparent force that moved with the caster. The hemisphere served to protect the caster against magical and non-magical missile attacks targeted specifically at them, but it did not protect against explosions from nearby missile attacks.

When a missile struck the ''baneful defelctor'' it would deflect and randomly strike a different living target within {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}}. The original target was a possible target for this random deflection. If the original target was struck by the deflection then the spell would instantly fail.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a small prism to cast. The prism was shattered during the casting.
