'''''Jungle avatar''''' was a potent [[divine magic]] spell available to [[priest]]s of the [[Zakhara]]n [[Zakharan pantheon|savage goddess]] [[Ragarra]], and some specialized [[kahin]]s. It temporally changed the caster into a [[greater segarran]].

==Effects==
This dangerous spell physically transformed a priest into a [[huge]] [[crocodile]]-headed [[divine minion]] of the goddess Ragarra called a greater segarran, but kept their magic items, their wits, and most of their spellcasting ability intact. If the priest was powerful enough, the magic also provided [[bat]]-like wings to fly.<ref> When an enemy was slain by this form, the segarran was compelled to consume the victim at once. The priest could change back before the spell had run its course, but if no opponent had been overwhelmed and devoured, the lethal danger of the shapechange was increased, showing Ragarra's disfavor.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of specially blessed water, some blood, bitter [[herb]]s, and ground scales from a [[giant crocodile]], mixed and drunk by the priest.
