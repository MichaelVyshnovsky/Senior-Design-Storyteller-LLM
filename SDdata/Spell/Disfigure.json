        "mainbody": "Disfigure was an alteration spell that permanently transformed the appearance of a person or creature in such a way they were completely repulsive to those they encountered.\nUnless the target could resist the disfigures effects, their appearance was so completely deformed that others could hardly stand their presence. Their face and skin became covered in welts, boils, scars and other malformations. Those who met the affected individual were often disgusted with the mere sight of them, turning away if they did not attack them with hostility outright.\nThe effects of disfigure could be reversed with a casting of remove curse, limited wish or wish.\nDisfigure was open used as a punishment, when spellcasters sought to ensure the loyalty of their followers or when they wished to send a message to their rivals."
