        "mainbody": "'''''Wizard gong''''' was a rare [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[schools of magic]] that was used as a silent alarm by [[wizard]]s on the world of [[Oerth]].",
        "Effects": "The spell's target was a door, window, portal, lid, or similar egress that was touched by the spellcaster in the process. Once ''wizard gong'' was cast, it remained active indefinitely until the alarm went off or until the caster left the same plane of existence as the ensorcelled object. Whilst the ''wizard gong'' remained active, the wizard could not access the portion of their memory where the spell was stored, even with rest, study, or through magical recovery. Only one ''wizard gong'' could be active at a time. When active, the ''wizard gong'' spell was undetectable and unremovable, could not be disrupted by any means, and radiated no magic.\n\nOnce the ensorcelled egress was opened, breached, broken, or destroyed, the wizard received the feeling of silent alarm in the form of vibration.",
        "Components": "''Wizard gong'' required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. The material component for the spell was a clear and colorless [[gemstone]] worth not less than 1,000 [[gp]]. The gem was not consumed in the process.",
        "History": "The ''wizard gong'' spell was known to [[Rautheene]] of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of [[the Wizards Three]] during their visit to [[Earth]] and raiding the larders of [[Ed Greenwood]] of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of [[Toril]] by [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], a member of the same group.{{Cite dragon/242/Jest the Wizards Three|50}}"
