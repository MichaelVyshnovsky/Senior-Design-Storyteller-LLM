        "mainbody": "Wizard gong was a rare arcane spell from the alteration and evocation schools of magic that was used as a silent alarm by wizards on the world of Oerth.\nThe spells target was a door, window, portal, lid, or similar egress that was touched by the spellcaster in the process. Once wizard gong was cast, it remained active indefinitely until the alarm went off or until the caster left the same plane of existence as the ensorcelled object. Whilst the wizard gong remained active, the wizard could not access the portion of their memory where the spell was stored, even with rest, study, or through magical recovery. Only one wizard gong could be active at a time. When active, the wizard gong spell was undetectable and unremovable, could not be disrupted by any means, and radiated no magic.\nOnce the ensorcelled egress was opened, breached, broken, or destroyed, the wizard received the feeling of silent alarm in the form of vibration.\nWizard gong required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. The material component for the spell was a clear and colorless gemstone worth not less than 1,000 gp. The gem was not consumed in the process.\nThe wizard gong spell was known to Rautheene of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of the Wizards Three during their visit to Earth and raiding the larders of Ed Greenwood of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of Toril by Elminster of Shadowdale, a member of the same group."
