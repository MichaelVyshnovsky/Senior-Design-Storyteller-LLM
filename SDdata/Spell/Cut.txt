'''''Cut''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that neophyte wizards could learn. It sliced relatively thin or soft material with a quick gesture.

==Effects==
This spell only worked on non-living, non-magical materials that were thin and relatively susceptible to cutting, such as [[rope]], cord, twine, [[sausage]], cloth, [[parchment]], a [[wax]] [[candle]], a slender [[wire]], or a delicate [[chain]]. The target of this spell had to be in sight and within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. For severing objects such as rope, the object could not be more than {{SI|0.5|in|c|long=yes}} thick. For cutting objects like cloth, a slice up to {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} long could be made.The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' reduced the range and limited the thickness of what could be cut with this spell. When cast, this spell gave off a small cloud of harmless blue sparks.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components. The caster gestured with two adjacent fingers of one hand in a scissor motion while softly making a sound of a cut, like ''"snikt"''.

==History==
The description of this cantrip was recorded in the infamous spellbook known as ''[[The Alcaister]]'', along with two others.The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
