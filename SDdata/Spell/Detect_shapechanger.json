        "mainbody": "Detect shapechanger was a common spell used by shugenja and wu jen. It was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell allowed the caster to see the true form of a shape-changing creature but did not reveal its alignment. If the creature was already in its true form when the spell was cast, the spell revealed if the creature had shape-changing abilities, but not the form or forms into which it could change. The spell could only be cast on one creature at a time, and the creature had to be within 60 yards (54 meters) of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component. When cast, the caster had to apply a balm made of honey and lotus flower on the subjects eyelids."
