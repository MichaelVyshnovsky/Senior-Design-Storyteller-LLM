        "mainbody": "'''''Detect shapechanger''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wu jen]]. It was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "The spell allowed the caster to see the true form of a shape-changing creature but did not reveal its alignment. If the creature was already in its true form when the spell was cast, the spell revealed if the creature had shape-changing abilities, but not the form or forms into which it could change. The spell could only be cast on one creature at a time, and the creature had to be within 60 yards (54 meters) of the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]. When cast, the caster had to apply a balm made of honey and lotus flower on the subject's eyelids."
