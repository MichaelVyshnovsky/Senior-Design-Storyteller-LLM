        "mainbody": "Sanctified marker was a divine invocation spell from the creation sphere that created a permanent stone obelisk that served several purposes.\nThe sanctified marker was any size, shape, and color the caster desired, so long as it did not exceed twice their body length. Multiple sanctified markers could be stacked upon each other, and the marker would stand wherever it was set during casting, floating in midair if need be if there was no solid ground. A marker could be blank, bear a single symbol, or bear a single symbol and an inscription. None of the symbols or inscriptions could be magical in nature. A sanctified marker could be designed to explode the moment it was attacked with magic or a magic item.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components three drops of holy water and a stone the size of the casters palm to cast.\nSanctified marker was granted to priests of Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs."
