        "mainbody": "'''''Sanctified marker''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[invocation]] [[spell]] from the [[creation sphere]] that created a permanent stone obelisk that served several purposes.",
        "Effects": "The ''sanctified marker'' was any size, shape, and color the caster desired, so long as it did not exceed twice their body length. Multiple ''sanctified markers'' could be stacked upon each other, and the marker would stand wherever it was set during casting, floating in midair if need be if there was no solid ground. A marker could be blank, bear a single symbol, or bear a single symbol and an inscription. None of the symbols or inscriptions could be magical in nature. A ''sanctified marker'' could be designed to explode the moment it was attacked with magic or a [[magic item]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s three drops of [[holy water]] and a stone the size of the caster's palm to cast.",
        "History": "''Sanctified marker'' was granted to [[priest]]s of [[Deneir]], the Lord of All Glyphs."
