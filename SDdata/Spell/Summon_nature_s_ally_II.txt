Summon natures ally II was one of the series of summon natures ally spells available to druid and ranger spellcasters.
This spell functioned just like all summon natures ally spells, which in turn resembled the summon monster spells. It could summon a single black bear, crocodile, dire badger, dire bat, small elemental of any type, hippogriff, shark, viper, squid, or wolverine. It could also be used to summon up to three creatures that the summon natures ally I spell could summon.
The spell required a divine focus and both verbal and somatic components.
