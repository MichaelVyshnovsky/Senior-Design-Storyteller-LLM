Turn pebble to boulder was an alteration spell used by wizards.
This spell transformed a hurled pebble into a massive boulder as it moved through the air to a target. The pebble would both grow in size and increase its speed when thrown. A caster of intermediate skill could only affect a single stone with this spell, but those with more expertise could toss more. Regardless, only a single pebble could be thrown at a time.
The reverse of this spell, turn boulder to pebble, had the opposite effect and could only be used on naturally occurring boulders. Statues and other objects made from stone were not affected.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pebble to cast. The pebble reverted to its original size when the spell ended.
