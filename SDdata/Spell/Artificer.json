        "mainbody": "Artificers were a rare kind of arcane spellcaster who treated magic in the same manner as a mason might see a chisel as a tool for the creation of marvels. An artificer learned to wield their magic through the mastering of sigils and diagrams that they etched into that which they enchanted, as well as magical ingredients. Artificers infused objects of the world, be they inanimate or alive, with the power of the arcane, making them both powerful crafters and healers.\nthumb|left|125px|A wrench bearing the symbol of the artificer.\nArtificers were also prominent in Lantan.\nRegardless of their race or origin, artificers were generally known to worship the god Gond. Though some were known to worship deities related to their pursuits of crafting or knowledge, such as Moradin, Oghma, or Torm. Others were known to worship gods of magic, such as Corellon or Mystra. But there were also some who saw little use for gods, instead aligning themselves with universities or wizard enclaves.\nthumb|right|150px|A well-equipped artificer\nArtificers, like swordmages or wizards, gained their ability to wield arcane magic through training and practice. However, unlike either, artificers approached magic in an almost scientific way, and manipulated arcane energy through complex patterns of arcane power known as sigils, which they etched onto their weapons, implements (such as rods, staffs, or wands), and other such items for use as components for their spellcasting. If they lacked these components, artificers could simply etch sigils onto a different item for use over a period of extended rest.\nThrough these sigils, artificers could craft magical items, brew potions, or even infuse themselves or allies with magically enhanced abilities. It was this latter ability that was the most directly applicable to combat, as artificers could use the healing infusion spell to heal the wounds or boost the morale of their allies. Artificers might also call their powers rotes or infusions, though the term \"spell\" remained the technically correct term for all varieties. An artificers sigils and training also allowed them to cast rituals, much like wizards or clerics.\nAnother ability gained by artificers from their unique approach to magic was their ability to replenish a magical items energy without additional materials. Artificers could do this over a short rest by using their body as a channel for arcane energy, with which they then replenished the item. Their ability to do this was directly proportional to their own experience and intelligence.\nThe spell-like effects that were closest to the artificers view of magic were collectively called the school of artifice. As these spells were produced in way very different from conventional casting, it was considered a school of thaumaturgy. It was opposed to the schools of necromancy and enchantment/charm.\nArtificers often focused on specific technological pursuits, preferring to work more exclusively in one field or another. Depending on an artificers specialization they could develop more fantastic inventions of a given type.\nThese artificers specialized in combining various substances, compounds, and reagents in order to create spectacular effects. It was one of the more adaptable of artificery disciplines as well as the one practiced furthest back in history. An alchemists concoctions would often grant amazing powers to themselves or their allies, but could also sap the life force away from their opponents.\nNovice alchemists regularly achieved some level of proficiency with their required supplies and learned how to brew experimental elixirs. These draughts granted one of numerous boons to the imbiber and could even heal them of their wounds. Over the course of their career, more experienced alchemists developed more potent version of their elixirs and learned how to incorporate various restorative techniques to heal and restore their fellows. Master alchemists gained superior understanding of revitalization techniques, and had exposed themselves to so many chemicals, over time developed resistances and immunities to acids and poisons.\nthumb|right|300px|A rather ingenious artillerist developing new weapons of war in his workshop.\nSome artificers explored more direct methods to solving their problems through invention, by crafting devices that would launch energy projectiles, explosives, and other volatile missiles at others. Their industrious efforts produced spectacular ordnance that were sought out by wagers of war from across the planes.\nArtillerists utilized woodcarvers tools to develop and craft spectacular and volatile weaponry. Novice artillerists first learned how to construct and wield eldritch cannons, technological conduits of arcane energy that more–or–less resembled oversized firearms. These magic-infused bombards varied in size and form, ranging from hand-held devices the size of a pistol, to cannons the height of a goblin that had to rest on fabricated legs. In function, eldritch cannons could be made to spout a cone of flame, discharge bolts of force energy, or a blast of rejuvenating positive energy.\nBeyond their eldritch cannons, more experienced artillerists developed techniques to repurpose arcane implements―that is wands, rods, and staves―into magical firearms. By utilizing unique sets of sigils, these arcane firearms would function as an artillerists arcane focus, bolstering the potency of their chosen spells.\nAs they continued to hone their craft, skillful artillerists fine-tuned their eldritch cannons to make them more explosive. Master artillerists learned how to strategically place their cannons behind forms of cover and even operate two cannons simultaneously.\nthumb|right|250px|A kenku artificer, crafting some happy little friends.\nFollowing the destruction of Lantan during the Spellplague, many of the fallen nations artificers scattered throughout Faerûn.\nMany traveled to the East Rift to explore the ruins that had been unearthed in the wake of the Underchasms creation, becoming engineers for the dwarven city of Eartheart. Others took to exploring the Underdark for ancient relics and competing against artificers of factions rival to the Church of Gond.\nOthers became obsessed with studying the fallen civilization of Lantan and sought to recreate its lost technological wonders. Some were so bold as to aspire to one day defeat the sea monster that guarded its flooded ruins."
