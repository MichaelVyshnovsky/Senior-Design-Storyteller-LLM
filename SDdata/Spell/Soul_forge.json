        "mainbody": "Soul forge was a spell used by clerics of Moradin.\nWhen cast on a creature, this spell allowed said creature to be temporarily immune to fear and fear-based effects. This spell could only be cast on lawful good creatures, and there was a chance the spell could fail if cast on creatures other than dwarves.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Moradin."
