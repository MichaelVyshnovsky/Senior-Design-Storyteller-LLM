Contact other plane was a divination ritual or spell that mentally connected the caster to a another powerful mind.
Functioning similarly to the commune spell, this allowed the caster to contact another powerful mind. Unlike commune, the mind could be of anything from a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or even an unknown entity from another plane. The caster could ask five questions of the contact, and the contact could only answer with simple words like yes, no, maybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear. If an answer would be misleading then the entity might respond with a short phrase.
However, unlike the divine variant, this spell could cause massive damage and insanity to the caster as the other intellect might be too great and could break the casters mind. The insanity would last until the caster had a long rest or they were affected by a greater restoration. A caster was unable to use this spell in the phlogiston.
Only a vocal component was needed for the casting.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Chever in  and was originally called Chevers contact other plane.
