'''''Contact other plane''''' was a [[divination]] [[ritual]] or [[spell]] that mentally connected the caster to a another powerful mind.

==Effect==
Functioning similarly to the ''[[commune]]'' spell, this allowed the caster to contact another powerful mind. Unlike ''commune'', the mind could be of anything from a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or even an unknown entity from another plane. The caster could ask five questions of the contact, and the contact could only answer with simple words like ''yes'', ''no'', ''maybe'', ''never'', ''irrelevant'', or ''unclear''. If an answer would be misleading then the entity might respond with a short phrase.

However, unlike the divine variant, this spell could cause massive damage and insanity to the caster as the other intellect might be too great and could break the caster's mind. The insanity would last until the caster had a long rest or they were affected by a ''[[greater restoration]]''. A caster was unable to use this spell in the [[phlogiston]].

==Components==
Only a vocal component was needed for the casting.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Chever]] in {{Yearlink|-1914}} and was originally called '''''Chever's contact other plane'''''.
