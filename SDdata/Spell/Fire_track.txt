Fire track was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell created a spark that followed a target just like a hound on the scent. The target was identified by the caster either by name or physical description. If the target was not within the spells range for the last 24 hours, then the spark would fall to the ground and extinguish. If the target was within range, then the spark would land on the trail and begin to follow the target like a lit fuse. Scorch marks upon the ground clearly marked the path of the spark for the caster to see but these were easily swept clean.
Anything that got in the way of the spark would get burned as if contacted by a torch. Flammable surfaces were also susceptible to the spark as it passed. The fire track could not cross water and would extinguish as soon as it made contact. Strong wind, rain, or sand could also extinguish the fire track if it was covered. Targets who escape via teleportation caused the fire track to circle the area where the target disappeared until the spell ended.
This spell required hair or a drop of blood from a saluqi, or desert greyhound, that was wrapped in wax to cast.
