        "mainbody": "'''''Freshen''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn. It temporarily renewed or restored some shelf life to food, drink, or vegetable matter.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip had a {{SIAdj|30|ft}} range<ref group=\"note\">In 1{{st}}-edition terms, the range was <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the longer range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and could be used on things like [[milk]], alcoholic beverages, meat, raw vegetables, cut flowers, [[herb]]s, and similar items. The quantity that could be affected was about a bushel of vegetables, the meat of one [[sheep]], or a cask of liquid of similar size. The effects of ''freshen'' only lasted one hour. Creatures susceptible to damage from spells such as ''[[purify food and drink]]'' could suffer a minor injury from this cantrip.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. With one hand, the caster made a circle with the thumb and index finger and extended and splayed the remaining fingers while while making an appreciative \"mmmmmm\" sound.",
        "History": "This cantrip was recorded in the magical tome known as ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]''.{{Cite dragon/100/Pages from the Mages V|12}}<ref group=\"note\">The cantrips mentioned in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] and ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume III]]'' were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''."
