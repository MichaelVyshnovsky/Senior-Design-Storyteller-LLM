        "mainbody": "Wildshield was a wild magic alteration spell used by wild mages.\nThis spell enveloped the caster in a swirling mass of colors, completely concealing them from view outside of the shield though the caster could still view their surroundings normally. A wildshield completely absorbed incoming spell energy targeted at the caster, effects from magic items such as wands, and wild surges. The shield would also absorb energy from explosive magical attacks that detonated near the caster such as a fireball. \nA wildshield would remain until cancelled by the caster or when it reached its capacity for absorbing magical energy. If the capacity was met exactly then the shield would vanish, but if the final magical absorption exceeded the capacity of the shield then it would explode in a wild surge, negating the final incoming spell in the process. The caster within the shield was subjected to the effects of the exploding wild surge.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small sponge to cast. The glass tube was shattered during the casting."
