        "mainbody": "'''Cantrip''' was a [[universal spell]] that all wizards learned to cast during their apprenticeship. By means of this spell, all manner of very limited magical effects could be manifested at the will of the caster.",
        "Effects": "The effects that could be created were very minor, very brief, and mostly harmless, intended to entertain children or impress commoners. Effects included causing a puff of air to make candles flicker; briefly freshening plants and flowers; producing an ambient musical tune; enhancing odors and aromas; creating tiny [[dust devil]]s to clean a small area, and so on.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast cantrips.",
        "History": "In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''cantrip'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}",
        "Notable Users": "* The mage [[Sabirine]] was well known to have had a special interest in cantrips, and was an enthusiastic advocate of the continued use and refinement of them. Sabirine was known to have created several unique cantrips.{{LCRB}}"
