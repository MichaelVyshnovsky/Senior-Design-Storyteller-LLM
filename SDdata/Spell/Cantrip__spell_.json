        "mainbody": "Cantrip was a universal spell that all wizards learned to cast during their apprenticeship. By means of this spell, all manner of very limited magical effects could be manifested at the will of the caster.\nThe effects that could be created were very minor, very brief, and mostly harmless, intended to entertain children or impress commoners. Effects included causing a puff of air to make candles flicker briefly freshening plants and flowers producing an ambient musical tune enhancing odors and aromas creating tiny dust devils to clean a small area, and so on.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast cantrips.\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast cantrip within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.\n* The mage Sabirine was well known to have had a special interest in cantrips, and was an enthusiastic advocate of the continued use and refinement of them. Sabirine was known to have created several unique cantrips."
