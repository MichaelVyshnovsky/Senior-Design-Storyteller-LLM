        "mainbody": "'''''Vision of heaven''''' was a simple [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that granted a subject a tiny glimpse of the joy of the [[Seven Heavens]]. or who had dedicated themselves to the ideals of the [[celestial paragon]]s [[Domiel]] or [[Pistis Sophia]]. [[Mystra]] also might grant this spell to those who had been blessed by one of the [[Seven Sisters]].",
        "Effects": "Upon hearing the words of the caster, one evil subject within a short range would see a short vision of joyous [[Mount Celestia]] and would be overcome by a temporary sense of regret at her or his own deeds. So strong were such feelings that the weak-willed would be dazed for several seconds. While the dazing effect was brief, for the next day, he or she was more susceptible to repentance and redemption.",
        "Components": "''Vision of heaven'' required only [[verbal component]]s."
