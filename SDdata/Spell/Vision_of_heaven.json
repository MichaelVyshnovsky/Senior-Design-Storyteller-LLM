        "mainbody": "Vision of heaven was a simple divine enchantment spell that granted a subject a tiny glimpse of the joy of the Seven Heavens. or who had dedicated themselves to the ideals of the celestial paragons Domiel or Pistis Sophia. Mystra also might grant this spell to those who had been blessed by one of the Seven Sisters.\nUpon hearing the words of the caster, one evil subject within a short range would see a short vision of joyous Mount Celestia and would be overcome by a temporary sense of regret at her or his own deeds. So strong were such feelings that the weak-willed would be dazed for several seconds. While the dazing effect was brief, for the next day, he or she was more susceptible to repentance and redemption.\nVision of heaven required only verbal components."
