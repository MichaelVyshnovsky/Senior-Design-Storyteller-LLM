'''''Transcribe symbol''''' or '''''Transcribe''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s.{{cite book/Spell Compendium|222}}

==Effects==
This spell protected the caster's hand from any harmful effects that would trigger when touching a ''[[symbol]]'' or other such spell. The touched magical symbol was removed from its placement and held in the caster's hand, allowing the caster to place the magical symbol in an appropriate location of their choosing. The magical symbol would function normally after being moved in this manner.

The magical symbol would instantly trigger on the caster, and only the caster, if their concentration was broken while holding the symbol.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a piece of slate that had been scoured bare and smooth on one side to cast.
