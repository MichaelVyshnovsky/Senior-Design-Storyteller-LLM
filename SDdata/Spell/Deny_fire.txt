'''''Deny fire''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that protected the recipient from natural and [[magic]]al fire.

==Effects==
While ''deny fire'' had the same effect as the [[divine]] [[spell]] ''[[resist fire]]'', it actually repelled heat and flames rather than strengthened the body of the spell's recipient.

==Casting==
The casting of the spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components as well as a small piece of hide taken from a [[Red dragon|red]] or [[gold dragon]].
