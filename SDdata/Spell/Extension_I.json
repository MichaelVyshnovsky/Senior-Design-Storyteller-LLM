        "mainbody": "Extension I was an alteration and metamagic spell that increased the time another spell lasted.\nIf cast directly after another spell requiring less magical power, extension I prolonged that spell to one and a half times its original duration.\nExtension I required verbal components only.\nThis spell was created by Netherese arcanist Zwei in −2579 DR (1280 NY), then known as Zweis 1st extension. It was the first spell of Netherese origin to survive into the Present Age.\nBy the 1360s DR, it was considered uncommon in the magical community in Faerûn, and also only rarely found in Zakhara.\nIt fell out of use after the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, when experienced spellcasters developed the talent to modify some aspects of their spells, like extending the duration.3rd edition introduced metamagic feats, including \"Extend spell\". The extension spells, however, did not appear after 2nd edition."
