        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow skeleton''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to create semi-real illusions of [[humanoid]] skeletons.",
        "Effects": "The number of skeletons created by this spell was determined by the caster's skill, but all of the skeletons had to be the same type. The ''shadow skeletons'' were murky forms that could not grasp objects, though the caster could have the skeletons equipped however they desired.\n\nSince they were mere illusions, the ''shadow skeletons'' were not harmed by any magic meant to hurt [[undead]] or any other physical form of attack. Nor could they be turned. Living creatures who came into contact with a ''shadow skeleton'' had a chance of being temporarily stunned.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of bone to cast. The bone served as a focal point for the caster's concentration and was not consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "This spell was found in the [[tome]] ''[[Tasso's Arcanabula]]''."
