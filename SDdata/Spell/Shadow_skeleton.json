        "mainbody": "Shadow skeleton was an arcane illusion spell that allowed the caster to create semi-real illusions of humanoid skeletons.\nThe number of skeletons created by this spell was determined by the casters skill, but all of the skeletons had to be the same type. The shadow skeletons were murky forms that could not grasp objects, though the caster could have the skeletons equipped however they desired.\nSince they were mere illusions, the shadow skeletons were not harmed by any magic meant to hurt undead or any other physical form of attack. Nor could they be turned. Living creatures who came into contact with a shadow skeleton had a chance of being temporarily stunned.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of bone to cast. The bone served as a focal point for the casters concentration and was not consumed during the casting.\nThis spell was found in the tome Tassos Arcanabula."
