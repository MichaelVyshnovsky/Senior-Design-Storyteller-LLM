        "mainbody": "lso known as a sword slug, the metalmaster was a carnivore that could magnetically attract, repulse and crudely manipulate metal objects.\nThe metalmaster was an amorphous creature with slimy purple skin, four eyes on stalks, and a round mouth of sharp teeth. Pieces of metal adhered to its skin and smaller metallic bits formed a rusty entourage as it moved.\nSword slugs were not much for conversation and tended to be rather single-minded about their next meal.\nMetalmasters could detect a pound (0.45 kg) of metal within 60 ft (18 m) and know its general direction. It could then magnetically attract or repel them, making weapons feel like they were entangled or deflecting them from hitting. Metal shields and armor that could not be dropped quickly pulled or pushed their owners with a strong constant force.\nThe metal shards stuck to its body formed additional armor for the creature, but it could also be used to create a storm of razor-like shrapnel that swirled in a 20 ft (6 m) radius. This removed the extra armor plating, making the sword slug easier to hit but more difficult to approach.\nThe metalmaster could pick one metal object or creature within its detection range and manipulate it as if by telekinesis, with the same strength as its repulsion/attraction ability.\nMetalmaster were solitary or traveled in groups of up to four."
