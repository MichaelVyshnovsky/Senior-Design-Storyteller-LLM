        "mainbody": "Minor illusion was a cantrip used by bards, sorcerers, and wizards.\nThis spell allowed the caster to create a auditory or visual illusion within 30 feet (9 meters) from them. The visual illusion could not be larger than cube 5 feet (1.5 meters) per side. It could not generate any sensory output such as light or sound. The illusion was not solid. The caster was able to manipulate the auditory illusions volume and type. It could be anything from a human voice speaking at a normal tone to the roar of a large creature. The duration of the sound could also be determined by the caster. This spell was vulnerable to detection if examined closely.\nIn addition to a somatic component, the spell required a material component a small piece of fleece."
