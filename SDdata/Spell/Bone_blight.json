        "mainbody": "Bone blight was an arcane spell from the schools of alteration and necromancy that allowed a wizard to erode the victims bones.\nThe spells magic caused the victims bones to slowly melt away, turning them into a mound of flesh. This spell had no effect on the undead. The victims bones became brittle and susceptible to breaking during the first day after casting. After the first week the victim experienced painful bone fractures until eventually the bones dissolved, leaving the victim as a mound of flesh and dying painfully. Naturally healing was impossible while under the effect of bone blight, and magical healing merely slowed the excruciating process.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a drop of aqua regia to cast.\nThis spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara."
