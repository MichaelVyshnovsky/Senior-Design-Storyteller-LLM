        "mainbody": "'''''Bone blight''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to erode the victim's bones.",
        "Powers": "The spell's magic caused the victim's bones to slowly melt away, turning them into a mound of flesh. This spell had no effect on the [[undead]]. The victim's bones became brittle and susceptible to breaking during the first day after casting. After the first week the victim experienced painful bone fractures until eventually the bones dissolved, leaving the victim as a mound of flesh and dying painfully. Naturally healing was impossible while under the effect of ''bone blight,'' and magical healing merely slowed the excruciating process.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a drop of aqua regia to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]]."
