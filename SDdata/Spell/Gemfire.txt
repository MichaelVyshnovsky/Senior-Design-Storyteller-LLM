Gemfire was an alteration spell that caused all of the gems and rock crystals within a certain area to explode.
The area effect of gemfire was a circle centered upon the caster, that extended out in a radius of 20 (6.1 m). Any natural, non-enchanted gems stones or rock crystal within this area burst into dust, which then proceeded to catch fire. Any person or creature caught within the blast could be significantly damaged.
A more powerful version of this spell, known as Gharradins slow gemfire had been developed.
This spell only required verbal components in order to be cast.
Like many arcane spells from throughout the realms, gemfire traced its origins to the ancient Netheril.
