'''''Gemfire''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that caused all of the [[gem]]s and rock crystals within a certain area to explode.{{Cite dragon/255/Wyrms of the North: Thalagyrt}}

==Effects==
The area effect of ''gemfire'' was a circle centered upon the caster, that extended out in a radius of 20' (6.1 m). Any natural, non-[[Item enchantment|enchanted]] gems stones or [[rock crystal]] within this area burst into dust, which then proceeded to catch fire. Any person or creature caught within the blast could be significantly damaged.

==Variants==
A more powerful version of this spell, known as ''[[Gharradin's slow gemfire]]'' had been developed.

==Components==
This spell only required [[verbal component]]s in order to be cast.

==History==
Like many [[arcane]] spells from throughout the realms, ''gemfire'' traced its origins to the ancient [[Netheril]].
