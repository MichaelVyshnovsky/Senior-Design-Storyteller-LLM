'''''Castigate''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A shugenja used this spell to deliver a scathing condemnation upon a creature. Creatures of the same [[alignment]] as the shugenja were temporarily deafened, while creatures of a different alignment suffered damage, especially creatures of an opposite alignment.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], the ''[[holy symbol]]'' of the shugenja.
