        "mainbody": "'''''Hatch the stone from the egg''''' was a bizarre [[spell]] combining [[alteration]], [[enchantment]], and [[evocation]] [[arcane magic]] that was used by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell was used to create a [[magic item]] known as a ''[[philosopher's stone]]''. After researching the required alchemical formula and gathering the necessary ingredients, the caster enchanted the mixture with the ''[[enchant an item]]'' spell followed by the ''hatch the stone from the egg'' spell which slowly transformed the mixture into the ''philosopher's stone''. A ''[[permanency]]'' spell completed the process.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a ''[[philosopher's egg]]'' to cast. The egg was not destroyed when casting the spell."
