        "mainbody": "Withdraw was an alteration spell that allowed the caster to slow time as he or she experienced it in order to contemplate a problem or cast a personal spell.\nThis spell bent time around the caster so that a few minutes (based on the casters level) passed for the caster while only one minute passed for everyone else. During the time spent withdrawn from the time stream, the caster could use this extra time to ponder his or her next move, solve a problem, cast a divination spell, or cast a heal or cure on himself or herself. The caster could not move from the spot where withdraw was cast, nor interact with others, nor perform any actions other than those listed above&mdashattempting to do so canceled the spell. A successful attack on the caster also broke the spell.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. In Kara-Tur, a material component was required, a scroll made from rice paper."
