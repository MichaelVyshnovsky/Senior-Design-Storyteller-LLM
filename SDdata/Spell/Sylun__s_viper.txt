Sylunés viper was an offensive wizard spell created by Syluné Silverhand.
This spell changed one of the casters arm into a snake. The caster could execute a fanged bite attack with the snake and could even see through the snakes eyes if they desired. Each bite had a chance to make the victim breakout in convulsions. The snake arm was weightless and the caster could extend the arm for up to . The snake ignored all armor when biting. Spells designed to affect snakes had no effect on the arm.
The caster could not use the snake arm to constrict enemies. The caster could climb walls with the arm by affixing the head at a summit within range and then pulling the caster upwards. The caster was unable to cast other spells requiring the use of both hands while this spell was active, but they could dismiss the spell at any time.
The snake arm was susceptible to physical harm and would vanish when "killed." In fact, any damage directed at the caster in general was absorbed by the snake arm until it was destroyed, allowing the caster to avoid harm for a time being.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a scale and tooth from a snake to cast.
