        "mainbody": "'''''Sand whisper''''' was a spell used by [[wizard]]s in [[Anauroch]]. It was very rare outside Anauroch.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created a small area of silence around a target creature or item. Any sound emitted by the target was transmitted to distant and random locations up to 24 miles (39 kilometers) distant. Additionally, if the target creature was attacked by a creature whose primary weapon were noise-based, such as a [[banshee]], their attack was also transmitted. The spell did not prevent a targeted creature from speaking vocal components of a spell or words of activation for a magical item.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell had a [[material component]]. The caster sprinkled two handfuls of [[sand]] on the target during casting."
