        "mainbody": "Alter breath weapon was a spell used by dragons.\nA dragon used this spell to alter the appearance and properties of their breath weapons. They were able to mimic the breath weapon of another species of dragon. This was not an illusion, the alteration was very real, and the damage inflicted matched the original breath weapon of the dragon. If the dragon had multiple breath weapons, only one was changed. The dragon was unable to use this spell more than once at a time, they could not switch breath weapons as they pleased. If the dragon attempted to cast this spell again immediately after casting it, in an attempt to alter more than one breath weapon, it failed and the original spell collapsed. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
