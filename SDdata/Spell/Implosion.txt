Implosion was a powerful divine evocation spell that slew creatures outright.
By creating a destructive resonance effect in the body of a creature, implosion made the target collapse into itself and die. The effect was instantaneous it could not be dispelled, but could be resisted by fantastic fortitude. While only one creature could be targeted within several seconds, and none could be targeted twice, it lasted up to 102 seconds, longer for more experienced casters. Only corporeal creatures could be slain gaseous and incorporeal creatures were unaffected.
It needed only verbal and somatic components.
