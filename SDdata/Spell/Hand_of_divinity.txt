Hand of divinity was a protective spell.
When cast, the spell created an aura of protective divine energy around a targeted creature. It could only be cast if the targeted creature worshiped the same patron as the caster. If the spell was cast by an evil cleric or paladin, it was considered an evil spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus.
