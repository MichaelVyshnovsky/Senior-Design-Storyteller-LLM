        "mainbody": "Speeding trident was a divine evocation spell that conjured forth a trident-shaped projectile of water.\nWhen cast, a speeding trident of solidified water launched forth from the cleric towards its target. The trident was strong enough that its tines could pierce normal armor.\nThe name of this spell appeared on the surface of the Umberlant relic, the Orglara.\nThere was an improved version of this spell, called battle trident.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three drops of water and three points made up of ferrous metal."
