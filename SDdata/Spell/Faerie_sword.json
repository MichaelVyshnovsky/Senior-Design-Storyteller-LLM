        "mainbody": "Faerie sword was an elven wizard spell from the school of evocation.\nThis spell created a shimmering sword for the caster to use. The magic of the sword made it easier for the caster to strike their foes. Additionally, the caster could choose for their enemy to experience a random effect instead of physical harm if struck by the sword. Examples of these random effects are listed below\n* Instant death,\n* Target teleported away,\n* Target imprisoned in a forcecage,\n* Target suffered greater harm,\n* Target petrified, or\n* Target randomly polymorphed.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small gold or crystal sword to cast. The small sword was consumed during the casting."
