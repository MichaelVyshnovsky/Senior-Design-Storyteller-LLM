        "mainbody": "Float was an arcane spell unique to Zakhara that was only usable by wizards. The undersea realm of Ser√¥s had a divine version of this spell, that the clerics of the elemental water and traveler spheres were able to cast.\nThis spell was used to make a recipient more buoyant in water, similar to a cork. Unless prevented from rising to the surface, air-breathing recipients were immune to drowning while under the influence of this spell. This spell could also be used on items to bring them to the surface of a body of water.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as a material component in the form of bit of cork that the wizard champed on when casting. The divine version of this spell required only a verbal component and a material one in the form of a clerics holy symbol."
