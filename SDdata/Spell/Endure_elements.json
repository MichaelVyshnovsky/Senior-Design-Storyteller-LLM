The recipient and all they were wearing or carrying were insulated from cold or heat in the &ndash;50&deg; F to 140&deg; F (&ndash;46&deg; C to 60&deg; C) temperature range and instead perceived a comfortable temperature for the duration of the spell. ''Endure elements'' did not protect against magically generated weather, fire, cold-based attacks, smoke, suffocation, etc.",
