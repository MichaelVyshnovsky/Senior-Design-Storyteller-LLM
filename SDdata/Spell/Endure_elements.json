        "mainbody": "Endure elements was an abjuration spell that allowed the recipient to ignore normal extremes of non-magical heat or cold.\nThis spell lasted for 24 hours. The recipient and all they were wearing or carrying were insulated from cold or heat in the &ndash50&deg F to 140&deg F (&ndash46&deg C to 60&deg C) temperature range and instead perceived a comfortable temperature for the duration of the spell. Endure elements did not protect against magically generated weather, fire, cold-based attacks, smoke, suffocation, etc.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell."
