Draincone was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.
This spell was identical to dweomer vortex but more powerful. When cast, the spell summoned a conical vortex in the air. The vortex was a cone  in length with a  wide opening. The vortex glimmered and floated freely in the air. The spell drained up to twelve spells from another creature. The vortex was immune to most spells cast against it, but a dispel magic spell caused the vortex to collapse. The spell had no effect on the effects of antimagic shell, globe of invulnerability, and similar spells. The caster did not absorb the powers of a destroyed spell.
This spell required only a verbal component.
This spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor.
