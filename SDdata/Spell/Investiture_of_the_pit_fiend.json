The power caused some physical changes to the target. The targets mouth widened and gained fangs that could not be used as a weapon. The target also gained operational wings. The target also became immune to poison and gained some resistance against fire it was possible to enhance the latter with additional investiture magic except another investiture of the pit fiend. Every six seconds, the target could choose one additional power called an aspect. The three aspects were called aspect of pestilence, aspect of terror, and aspect of tyranny. Only one aspect could be activated at a time.\nOn choosing the aspect of pestilence, the beneficiary of the spell could pollute the air within 10 feet (3 meters) of him or her with disease. People without sturdy bodies could suffer from deterioration of heir physical strength from it.\nOn choosing the aspect of terror, the beneficiary of the spell could exude an aura of fear that caused people to flee from the beneficiary.\nOn choosing the aspect of tyranny, the beneficiary could enhance their physical combat prowess. The target gained claws and the ability to attack with them as well as with the wings.\nInvestiture of the pit fiend had two downsides. First, while under the influence of this spell, the beneficiary was as susceptible to bane weapons as an evil outsider was. Furthermore, when the duration of this spell ran out, the beneficiary was physically exhausted for one minute from the spell.\nInvestiture of the pit fiend required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a fist-sized piece of brimstone.\nInvestiture of the pit fiend was a spell granted to clerics with access to the Diabolic domain, meaning they were always worshipers of archdevils such as Asmodeus, Baalzebul, etc.."
