'''''Bones of the earth''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that raised pillars of stone from the ground.

==Effects==
The spell caused up to six pillars to rise within a range of {{SI|120|feet|long=yes}}. The pillars had a diameter of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} and rose up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. A pillar could lift up a creature that could not move away quickly enough and could crush and pin a creature to a sufficiently low ceiling. Once emerged, the pillars could be attacked and destroyed, but were otherwise permanent. More powerful casters could create a larger number of pillars.

==Components==
The spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
