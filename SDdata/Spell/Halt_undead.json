        "Effects": "When cast, it affected up to three individual undead creatures, stopping them in their steps as if affected by the ''[[paralyze]]'' spell. The less intelligent undead creatures were, the less likely they were to resist the ''halt undead'' spell. Non-intelligent monsters such as [[zombie]]s and [[skeleton]]s could never resist the spell.\n\n''Halt undead'' affected undead within {{SI|100'|'\"|long=yes}} from the caster (with a longer distance when used by more powerful spellcasters), and the affected creatures could not be more than {{SI|30'8|'\"|long=yes}} away from each other. The spell lasted for 10 minutes or until the ''halted'' creature was attacked or harmed in any way.",
        "Components": "The ''halt undead'' spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[Material component|material]] components to be cast. The spell's material component was a pinch of [[sulphur]] and powdered [[garlic]].",
