'''''Mass jump''''' was an [[arcane]]/[[divine]] [[alteration]] or [[transmutation]] spell that gave a group of creatures the ability to leap great distances for a short time.

==Effects==
All creatures within 10 ft (3 m) of the caster received this ability when ''mass jump'' was cast. For the next few minutes, they could leap 30 ft (9.1 m) straight up or forward in a low arc. Backward jumps were limited to 10 ft (3 m). Landing safely or grabbing onto something was the responsibility of the jumper.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the hind leg of a grasshopper to be broken at the time of casting.

==History==
This spell was associated with the pirates roaming the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] where they used it in boarding actions, jumping from ship to ship before they were close enough to grapple and heave to, giving the element of surprise against those that hadn't seen the maneuver before.
