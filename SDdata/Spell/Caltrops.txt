'''''Caltrops''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the [[war sphere]] that planted a target area with [[caltrop]]s.

==Effects==
The caster could choose between caltrops designed to hinder either infantry or cavalry. The caltrops designed for cavalry also worked to hinder larger creatures. Once placed, anyone entering the area with caltrops could be hindered by them.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a [[gold]] [[caltrop]] to cast.

==History==
The ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', a holy [[spellbook]] from the [[Church of Ilmater]], contained the ''caltrops'' spell.
