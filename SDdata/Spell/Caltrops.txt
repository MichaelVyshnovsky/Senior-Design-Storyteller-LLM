Caltrops was a divine evocation spell from the war sphere that planted a target area with caltrops.
The caster could choose between caltrops designed to hinder either infantry or cavalry. The caltrops designed for cavalry also worked to hinder larger creatures. Once placed, anyone entering the area with caltrops could be hindered by them.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a gold caltrop to cast.
The Tome of Torment, a holy spellbook from the Church of Ilmater, contained the caltrops spell.
