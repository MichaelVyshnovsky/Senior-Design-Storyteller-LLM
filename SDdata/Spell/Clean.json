        "mainbody": "'''''Clean''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn. It removed dirt, mud, heavy soil, and similar earthy substances from various surfaces.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip effectively cleaned one type of surface up to {{SI|4|sq yd|long=yes}} in area. It could be applied to walls, floors, ceilings, windows, curtains, clothing, mirrors, dishes, ''etc.'' The caster had to be careful about the target of the spell because it could also remove certain pigments used in paint.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The caster made a circular waving motion while softly but forcefully exhaling.",
        "History": "This cantrip was described on the first page of ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'', penned by the famous [[Bowgentle|mage from Silverymoon]].{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|30}}<ref group=\"note\">The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''. It also appeared in ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]''.{{Cite dragon/100/Pages from the Mages V|12}}"
