        "mainbody": "Clean was a useful cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It removed dirt, mud, heavy soil, and similar earthy substances from various surfaces.\nThis cantrip effectively cleaned one type of surface up to  in area. It could be applied to walls, floors, ceilings, windows, curtains, clothing, mirrors, dishes, etc. The caster had to be careful about the target of the spell because it could also remove certain pigments used in paint.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components. The caster made a circular waving motion while softly but forcefully exhaling.\nThis cantrip was described on the first page of Bowgentles Book, penned by the famous mage from Silverymoon.The three cantrips described in Dragon #97 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip. It also appeared in Sabirines Specular."
