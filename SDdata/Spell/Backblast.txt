'''''Backblast''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell surrounded the caster or target creature with an invisible aura. If the individual was targeted by a [[fire]]-based spell, that spell was automatically thrown back to the source. Distance was not a limiting factor with this spell, so if the targeted creature was struck by a time-delayed fire-based spell, such as ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', the fireball was sent back to the person who cast it, even if they have left the area. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' was able to cancel this spell. This spell only protected a single creature at a time. 

==Components==
This spell required only a [[verbal]] component.

==History==
It was stolen by magic-users of other races and could later be found in many [[spellbook]]s across [[Faerûn]].
