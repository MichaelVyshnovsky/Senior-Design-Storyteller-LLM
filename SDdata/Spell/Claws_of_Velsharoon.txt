Claws of Velsharoon was an arcane and divine spell used by necromancers and priests devoted to Velsharoon.
This spell allowed the caster to animate and control crawling claws. The claws were controlled via a telepathic link. The number of crawling claws that could be animated depended on the skill of the caster, but if one of the casters crawling claws was destroyed then another could be animated to take its place. The magic animating the crawling claws was permanent unless the claw was destroyed.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a severed limb for each crawling claw that the caster intended to animate.
