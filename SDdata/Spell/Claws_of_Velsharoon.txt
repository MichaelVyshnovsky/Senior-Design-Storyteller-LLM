'''''Claws of Velsharoon''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] used by [[necromancer]]s and priests devoted to [[Velsharoon]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to [[Animate dead|animate]] and control [[crawling claw]]s. The claws were controlled via a telepathic link. The number of crawling claws that could be animated depended on the skill of the caster, but if one of the caster's crawling claws was destroyed then another could be animated to take its place. The magic animating the crawling claws was permanent unless the claw was destroyed.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a severed limb for each crawling claw that the caster intended to animate.
