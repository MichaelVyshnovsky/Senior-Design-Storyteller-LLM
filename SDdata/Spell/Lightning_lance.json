        "mainbody": "'''''Lightning lance''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a bolt of corporeal lightning that could be wielded or thrown as a weapon or discharged at will.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, a 4-foot-long (1.2 meters) shaft of lightning appeared in the caster's hand. If they wished, the [[cleric]] could discharge the ''lance'' upon an object or surface, throw it in a manner similar to a ''[[javelin]]'', or wield it as a [[polearm]].\n\nIf the ''lightning lance'' was thrown, it flew through the air and damaged any person or creature it struck, similar to a ''[[lightning bolt]]''. When wielded as a melee weapon, the ''lance'' functioned as if it possessed a ''+1 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the [[Talassan]] [[relic]], the ''[[Chanting Chain]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
