'''''Maladweomer''''' was a [[spell]] utilized by [[wizard]]s to manipulate the effectiveness of spells and magical powers cast by targeted creatures.
 
==Effects==
When cast, the spell imposed a state of diminished effectiveness on all spells and spell-like powers used by the targeted creature. Offensive magical attacks inflicted only minimal damage. Additionally, any ongoing spells or enchantments active on the target at the time of spell's effect were modified in efficacy. 

The reverse of this spell, '''''[[dweomerboost]]''''', was also known as '''''empradweomer'''''. Dweomerboost empowered the recipient creature to cast or wield magic at its maximum efficiency.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a small clear glass or crystal prism that was forcefully shattered during the spellcasting process. However, when ''dweomerboost'' was cast, the crystal or glass simply vanished upon the completion of the spellcasting
