'''''Acorn barrage''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Rillifane Rallathil]], the Great Oak. It allowed the caster to pelt one or more targets with [[acorn]]s.

==Effects==
Casting this spell required a source of acorns, either in the caster's hand, on the ground, or from an [[oak]] tree within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. The acorns became projectiles as if the caster had hurled them individually using a [[sling]], with a maximum range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. The missiles could be aimed at any targets in any combination within this range as long as the caster could see the targets. A novice could hurl two acorns, but more experienced priests could throw increasing numbers of missiles. A single successful attack did a modicum of damage and the projectiles themselves were not magical.

The caster's dexterity with a sling was irrelevant unless the acorns were held in the hand. This spell was useless if cast under water.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a source of acorns.
