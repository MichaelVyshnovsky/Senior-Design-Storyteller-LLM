        "mainbody": "Hurl rock was a divine spell that allowed a cleric to launch a single stone in the air towards a desired target. The reverse of this spell, rock shield, allowed the caster to deflect any stones or that were launched in their direction.\nWhen cast, hurl rock allowed the caster to use a form of telekinesis to launch a stone towards a target creature, item or location. Any loose rock, boulder or even part of a rock face was suitable so long as it was under a certain size. This size, along with the distance the projectile could travel, was dependent on the skill and power of the caster. The hurled stone could be destroyed in flight, after impact, and had a chance of releasing rocky shrapnel that damaged anyone nearby.\nRock shield created a magical barrier around the caster that deflected any rocky projectiles launched at them. It remained in effect for a matter of seconds, depending on the skill and power of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the hurl rock spell required a single pebble and the desired rocky projectile. The material components for rock shield were two spell pebbles and a piece of semi-transparent material such as glass, ice, or even a small gem.\nHigh-ranking dwarven priests of Haela Brightaxe were typically known to have this spell bestowed upon them."
