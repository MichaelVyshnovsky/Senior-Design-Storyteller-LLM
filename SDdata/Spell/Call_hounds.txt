'''''Call hounds''''' was a [[divine]] [[cleric]] spell granted by the [[hin]] deity [[Urogalan]] the Protector.{{Cite dragon/236/Arcane Lore: Demihuman Priest Spells|40}}

==Effects==
Upon being cast, the spell ''[[summoning|summoned]]'' a pair of black [[hound]]s that materialized anywhere within {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}} from the caster. Sent by Urogalan, these dogs were completely loyal to the cleric who summoned them. These fearsome black wards were smarter than an average beast and were intelligent enough to follow complex commands and instructions. The only way to break the caster's control over the jet hounds was by means of the ''[[wish]]'' spell or the meddling of another [[deity]]. The more powerful the caster was, the longer the spell lasted.

''Call hounds'' could not be ''[[Dispelling|dispelled]]'' and the only way of ending it was by slaying the summoned dogs, via the ''[[banishment]]'' spell, or by killing or knocking the caster out.

The summoned hounds could not perform any tasks that went against the teachings and dogma of Urogalan, and if ordered to do so, they simply vanished.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material components were the caster's [[holy symbol]] and a [[silver]] [[whistle (item)|whistle]], priced at at least 50 [[gold]] pieces. The cleric had to blow the whistle to perform the spell and it did not consume this material component.

==Notable Users==
* [[Grimwarden]]s, specialty priests of Urogalan, were given the ability to cast the spell.
