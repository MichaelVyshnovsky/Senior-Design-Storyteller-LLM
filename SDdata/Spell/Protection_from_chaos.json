        "mainbody": "'''''Protection from chaos''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that created an aura around the target that shielded against mental and physical attacks by chaotic creatures. This spell was not reversible, but a counterpart called ''[[protection from law]]'' was known.",
        "Effects": "The newer version of this spell functioned exactly like ''[[protection from evil]]'' except the bonuses and benefits applied to attacks from the minions of chaos. The older version of this spell treated summoned creatures slightly differently; they specifically had to be chaotic in alignment, so this version of the spell did not protect against all summoned and extraplanar creatures, just the chaotic ones.",
        "Components": "For the newest version of the spell, in addition to verbal and somatic components, the caster had to draw a 3 ft (91 cm) circle around the recipient using powdered silver. For the older version, the caster needed a small ring of [[gold]] or [[lead]] that had been tempered by a chaotic smith."
