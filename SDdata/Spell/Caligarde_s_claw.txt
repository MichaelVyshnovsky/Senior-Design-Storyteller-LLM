'''''Caligarde's claw''''' was an [[arcane]] [[conjuration]] spell that created an invisible claw made of pure force, similar to the various ''Bigby's hand'' spells.

==Effects==
This spell could be cast at a target up to {{SI|60|yd|long=yes}} away. The target could be a particular entity or a 20-ft (6.1 m) diameter circular area. If the target was an individual, then that person had a chance to resist the spell, in which case the claw was created {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} away in a random direction, as if it were a missed grenade-like missile attack.

Once cast on an area, either intentionally or by missing the intended target, the claw attacked the nearest being within its {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} reach. ''Caligarde's claw'' attacked once per minute for a duration equal to the caster's level, and with the same skill as the caster, but with the added feature that once it hit, it never missed again. If this spell successfully targeted an individual, then it was not fixed in place but continued to attack that being even if they moved more than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} away. A person taking damage from ''Caligarde's claw'' could not engage in normal spellcasting,<ref group="note">The 1st edition description is somewhat at odds with this statement. It says that the ''claw'' "did not necessarily physically interfere" with the target and therefore would not prevent spellcasting, but taking constant damage would certainly make it difficult to concentrate. but items that did not require an intricate activation sequence could be used.

Only magical barriers, such as ''[[anti-magic shell]]'', ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'', ''[[Bigby's interposing hand]]'', and the like, could block the claw attack. Physical counterattacks had no effect. ''Caligarde's claw'' could be destroyed by ''[[dispel magic]]'' and similar effects.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a dried or preserved foot or claw as a [[material component]].

==History==
This spell was first published in the ''[[Workbook]]'', a tome thought to have been written at the behest of the [[Mentor]] of the [[Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor]]. This spell was later published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community.

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''Caligarde's claws'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
