Caligardes claw was an arcane conjuration spell that created an invisible claw made of pure force, similar to the various Bigbys hand spells.
This spell could be cast at a target up to  away. The target could be a particular entity or a 20-ft (6.1 m) diameter circular area. If the target was an individual, then that person had a chance to resist the spell, in which case the claw was created  away in a random direction, as if it were a missed grenade-like missile attack.
Once cast on an area, either intentionally or by missing the intended target, the claw attacked the nearest being within its  reach. Caligardes claw attacked once per minute for a duration equal to the casters level, and with the same skill as the caster, but with the added feature that once it hit, it never missed again. If this spell successfully targeted an individual, then it was not fixed in place but continued to attack that being even if they moved more than  away. A person taking damage from Caligardes claw could not engage in normal spellcasting,The 1st edition description is somewhat at odds with this statement. It says that the claw "did not necessarily physically interfere" with the target and therefore would not prevent spellcasting, but taking constant damage would certainly make it difficult to concentrate. but items that did not require an intricate activation sequence could be used.
Only magical barriers, such as anti-magic shell, shield, Bigbys interposing hand, and the like, could block the claw attack. Physical counterattacks had no effect. Caligardes claw could be destroyed by dispel magic and similar effects.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a dried or preserved foot or claw as a material component.
This spell was first published in the Workbook, a tome thought to have been written at the behest of the Mentor of the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor. This spell was later published in "Volos Guide to All Things Magical" and became generally known to the magical community.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast Caligardes claws within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
