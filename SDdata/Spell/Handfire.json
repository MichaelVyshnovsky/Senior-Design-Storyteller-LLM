        "mainbody": "'''''Handfire''''' was a divine [[alteration]] or [[evocation]] [[spell]] that made the caster's hand glow with sparking lights.",
        "Users": "Originally, the spell could be cast by [[cleric]]s with access to the [[Combat sphere]], though it was actually granted by the goddess [[Sune]], Lady of Love.\n\n''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the basic form of the spell could be available to beginning clerics of [[Selûne]], as well as [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[Harper scout]]s and [[hathran]]sTwo versions of this spell were printed for 3{{rd}} edition: ''[[Magic of Faerûn]]'' presents one that any of these classes can cast, while ''[[Player's Guide to Faerûn]]'' presents one only available through the Initiate of Selûne feat, with hathrans removed in errata. The rules for Initiate feats state that these spells replace the existing spells ''if'' the feats are allowed in one's game. This wiki considers both to exist in the setting.",
        "Effect": "The caster's hand (or end of a selected limb) was surrounded by tiny winking motes of light, in the form of a cluster of sparks that continually renewed. They could be of any color (such as for use as a signal), but this was fixed after casting. They gave off light equivalent to a candle, enough to read by if held close. However, they emitted no heat and could not start a fire or damage inanimate matter.Based on artwork.\n\nIf struck against a foe, ''handfire'' caused a little damage to living creatures, and slightly more damage to [[undead]], though it had no effect against [[construct]]s and others that were not living but not undead. Originally, it could be used twice, then after the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a number of times according to the user's spellcasting skill. Initiates of Selûne could use it half as often as others, but it dealt twice as much damage. Furthermore, this version could be held for some minutes until discharged, like it could originally, whereas the later basic version only lasted several seconds. The hand had to directly touch another creature, and discharged automatically, even if the caster was asleep, so it was potentially hazardous to both allies and attackers. Some priests gripped their valuables with a ''handfire''-ready hand when they slept as a guard against theft.\n\n''Handfire'' did not alter or disrupt the casting of other spells. The charge would not conduct through a weapon or other item in the hand, but no armor in [[Faerûn]] was known to block it. Some magical barriers would stop it, however.\n\nIf not used, the ''handfire'' could be mentally dispelled, and sputtered out and faded in seconds. One use of the original ''handfire'' was to first strike another creature, then will the second charge into the caster's own body for some slight healing.",
        "Components": "Both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required, in addition to the caster's hand.",
        "Items": "A ''[[Sunite sash]]'' could create ''handfire'', and the spell was required for its creation.",
        "Notable Uses": "In [[767 DR]], [[Elminster]] readied ''handfire'' when exploring [[Scorchstone Hall]], and nearly used it when discovering Lady [[Sharindala]].<ref>\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was found only in a few incredibly rare tomes.\n\nIn [[1365 DR]] in [[Cormyr]], at the funeral of the murdered noble [[Athlan Summerstar]], his grandmother Dowager Lady [[Pheirauze Summerstar]] ordered his body burned on a pyre with \"holy handfire\" by a priest of [[Chauntea]], in order to banish any harmful magic.<ref><ref group=\"note\">It is unclear if this \"holy handfire\" is the same spell, as it can light a pyre, whereas ''handfire'' cannot ignite a fire. This might be artistic license or a description for another spell."
