'''''Spectacles of true seeing''''' were magical [[spectacles]] that allowed the wearer to see through magical [[illusion]]s and disguises and to ascertain the true nature of creatures who had their shape changed.

==Description==
The ''spectacles'' consisted of a pair of round [[Optic aid|glass lenses]] with a frame that could be fit around the ears when worn.

==Powers==
Upon speaking the ''spectacles''' command word, the wearer gained the ability to detect non-magical disguises, including [[makeup]], as well as magical illusions out to a range of {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. They were powerful enough to see through any illusion, except only for those cast by a [[deity]].

The ''spectacles'' were also capable of discerning the true nature of [[lycanthrope]]s and other [[:Category:Shapechangers|shapechanging]] creatures, as well as those under the effects of ''[[shapechange]]'' spells.

==History==
In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''spectacles of true seeing'' were employed by customs agents at [[The Resort]], a [[spelljamming]] port in [[Rauthaven]]. Their primary application was to detect and prevent the return of travalers who had been banned from visiting the premises as punishment for committing a serious crime on the island.
