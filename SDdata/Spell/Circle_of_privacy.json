        "mainbody": "Circle of privacy was an alteration spell that masked scent and muffled sound within the area of effect to better hide from predators or trespassers.\nAn area up to 50 ft (15 m) in diameter could be protected by this spell. All sounds and scents such as from talking, working, cooking, etc. were muted by circle of privacy, making it half as likely that creatures outside the area would notice activity within the area. The spell did not prevent light from escaping (so a campfire could be seen) nor prevent any sort of magical detection.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a skunk hair, a mouse whisker, and enough salt to draw a line surrounding the area (up to a 50 ft/15 m diameter circle).\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
