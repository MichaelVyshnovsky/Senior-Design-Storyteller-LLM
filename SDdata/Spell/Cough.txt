'''''Cough''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a target creature to suffer a brief fit of coughing.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could target a single person or creature. If the target did not resist the spell, then it experienced a loud bout of coughing for a duration of one to three seconds. If the spell was resisted, the target's breathing was only momentarily disrupted by a small cough that, in most circumstances (other than singing, perhaps), did not adversely affect any activity.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a gasping noise while placing a hand on their throat as if they were choking.
