Cough was a person-affecting cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It caused a target creature to suffer a brief fit of coughing.
This cantrip had a range of  and could target a single person or creature. If the target did not resist the spell, then it experienced a loud bout of coughing for a duration of one to three seconds. If the spell was resisted, the targets breathing was only momentarily disrupted by a small cough that, in most circumstances (other than singing, perhaps), did not adversely affect any activity.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a gasping noise while placing a hand on their throat as if they were choking.
