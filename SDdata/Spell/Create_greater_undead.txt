Create greater undead was a necromancy spell that created more powerful undead than the lesser create undead spell.
Working in the same manner as create undead, this spell allowed the caster to raise additional types of undead of greater power and intelligence. The type of undead created was based on how powerful the caster was. In order of magnitude, these types were shadows,
wraiths, spectres, and devourers.
