        "mainbody": "Mindkiller was a powerful divine enchantment and necromancy spell from the thought and necromantic spheres that placed the subjects personality into stasis, effectively turning them into a mindless automaton.\nOnce under the control of the spell, the subject would follow any telepathic commands issued by the caster regardless of any language barriers. Elf and half-elf magic resistance did not apply to the mindkiller spell. The caster could see the world through the subjects eyes while the spell was active. The subjects personality remained in stasis for the duration of the spell or until the caster released it, or a wish, limited wish or specific heal spell was used. The casters control ceased if the subjects body died. The death also wracked the caster with intense pain that had the potential drive them insane.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a gemstone worth at least 500 gp to cast. The gemstone was consumed during the casting.\nMindkiller was included within the Testament of Vraer, a spellbook written by a cleric of Kelemvor named Vraer."
