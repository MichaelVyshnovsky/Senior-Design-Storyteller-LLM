Darkvision, also known as infravision
This spell allowed either the spellcaster or the touched target to see in absolute darkness up to . The duration of the bestowed vision scaled with the experience of the caster. Most versions of the spell permitted vision only in black and white, although post-Second Sundering, sages reported that the spell could grant color vision. The spell did not function in magical darkness.
For some variations of the spell, highly luminous sources, such as torches or a blazing fire, essentially blinded this vision. Thus, the spell was usually used in dark areas only, since it would have hindered the recipient in well-lit areas.
Darkvision could be made permanent with permanency spell.
The spell required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component could either be an agate stone or a pinch of dried carrot.
The spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist, Nalevac, in . Infravision was also detailed in Bowgentles Book, as well as The Alcaister, and the Book of the Silver Talon.
