        "mainbody": "'''''Shimmer script''''' was a name given to a [[cantrip]] that obscured magical writings.",
        "Effects": "The shimmer script [[spell]] made magical writings impossible to clearly read using a ''[[wizard eyes]]'' spell or other form of [[scrying]], for the purposes of casting, copying, or memorizing. It applied to both the incantations and to the glyphs, runes, and symbols. It could be cast on either the [[ink]] that would be used to write the spell, or on a freshly written spell.",
        "History": "[[Inhil Lauthdryn|Inhil \"Hurler-of-Stars\" Lauthdryn]], the [[Magister]] from [[1282 DR|1282]] to [[1294 DR]], had a special love of blowing up castles, a hobby that had many others spying upon him. He developed the ''shimmer script'' spell to conceal his spells from them. The spell became widely used."
