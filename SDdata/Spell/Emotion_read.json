        "mainbody": "'''''Emotion read''''' was a simple [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to receive an instant read on a target's emotional state.",
        "Effects": "The spell was limited to reading the emotions of only one individual within {{SI|5|yards|long=yes}} or greater&mdash;and only the strongest of that individual's emotions. Targets with powerful strength of will could resist the read or even cause the spell to provide an opposite read from the true one. The spell gave no indication about the cause or topic of the emotion felt.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and an unmarked square of white wax."
