        "mainbody": "Emotion read was a simple divine spell that allowed a cleric to receive an instant read on a targets emotional state.\nThe spell was limited to reading the emotions of only one individual within  or greater&mdashand only the strongest of that individuals emotions. Targets with powerful strength of will could resist the read or even cause the spell to provide an opposite read from the true one. The spell gave no indication about the cause or topic of the emotion felt.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components and an unmarked square of white wax."
