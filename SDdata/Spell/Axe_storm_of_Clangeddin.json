        "mainbody": "'''''Axe storm of Clangeddin''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Clanggedin Silverbeard]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell increased an [[axe]]-wielding [[dwarf]]'s skill in melee combat. Their strikes were faster and more powerful, and axes thrown at a target never missed. The amount of individuals this spell affected was based on the caster's skill level. This spell was not cumulative, and ''[[slow]]'' cancelled out the effects of the spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Clanggedin Silverbeard and a small vial of air that was capped during a thunderstorm."
