Weird, originally known as Trebbes weird, Typically an arcane spell, it was also used by some clerics of the derro god Diirinka and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.
This spell functioned in the same manner as phantasmal killer, except that it could affect more than one target. The older version of this spell could affect all creatures within a 20 ft (6.1 m) radius. After the Time of Troubles and before the Spellplague, the radius shrank to 15 ft (4.6 m). Against this version of the spell, subjects with strong constitutions could survive the shock to their system, but would still be harmed and stunned for several seconds. They would also be weakened physically for ten minutes. After the Second Sundering, the radius grew to 30 ft (9.1 m) and the victims were continually assaulted for one minute by their worst nightmare beasts until they individually managed to disbelieve the illusion, the spell expired, or they died of psychic damage.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
This spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Trebbe in &ndash2240 DR (1619 NY, during Netherils Silver Age). It was known as Trebbes weird and was a ninth level spell in the school of mentalism magic.
