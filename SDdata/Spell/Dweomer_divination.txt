'''''Dweomer divination''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that revealed information about a touched item to the spell's caster over a short period of time. This knowledge was wide-ranging in scope and depth, covering a wealth of information.

==Effects==
''Dweomer divination'' revealed information about the nature of [[magic]] within the item in stages until the spell expired. Over a course of minutes, until the duration of ''dweomer divination'' ended, a variety of information regarding a select item was divulged to the caster. In order of succession, this information consisted of:
* All ''dweomers'' presently on or otherwise linked to the item and
* Any [[Alignment|morality]]- or skill-based restrictions or boons that either precluded or enhanced its use by certain individuals.

If an item was imbued with [[magic]]al [[Item enchantment|enchantments]], the following information was revealed. It was repeated for each specific dweomer:
* The complete functionality of how the item's most powerful dweomer worked,
* Any associated [[command word]]s, phrases of activation or lack thereof, and
* All errors or imperfections of the dweomer's function.

These last three revelations were repeated for every dweomer the item possessed, a process that continued until all information regarding the item was made clear. The spell could be used more than once on the same item to gain new information, but subsequent castings of the spell skipped over information already revealed to the caster and began where the last ''divination'' previously "left off".

If the item had no inherent dweomers, the caster became aware of that fact.

Once all the information regarding the dweomers the item possessed, if any, was made clear, the spell offered the some final particulars:
* Any special-purpose control words,
* Specific links to certain individuals,
* Methods to regain the item's charges or lack thereof, and
* Mental images of how the item was created.

===Errant Dweomers===
This spell not only revealed powers that were imbued into an item, either during its creation or possible subsequent enchantment, but also residual dweomers caused by powerful spells. ''Dweomer divination'' revealed general information about these magics, but not their exact specifications.

==Casting==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast, along with near-continuous contact between the caster and item. The spell ended prematurely if the caster failed to touch the item for over a minute, or if it held no dweomers.

==History==
This was an extremely rare spell used by [[priest]]s on [[Toril]].
