        "mainbody": "yrm was a destructive type of giant rune that allowed its wielder to decay objects.\nAny object inscribed with the wyrm rune would deteriorate over the course of one to ten days. This would cause wood to warp, metal to rust, and food to rot. However, this rune could not effect plants or animals.\nThe only known ways to remove the effect of this rune were the spells remove curse and dispel magic.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours. Due to limitations in its energy patterns, the rune could only be inscribed upon small objects.\nThe wyrm runes name was derived from the fact that, in giant legends, dragons were often seen as synonymous with destruction and decay."
