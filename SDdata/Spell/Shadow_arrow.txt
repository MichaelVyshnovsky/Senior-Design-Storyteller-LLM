'''''Shadow arrow''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that transformed a normal ''[[arrow]]'' into a missile of pure [[shadow]].

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, the ''arrow'' was consumed and transmogrified into a bolt of shadow that was shot forth from the caster. Rather than inflict a normal wound, the ''shadow arrow'' greatly weakened the person or creature it struck.

==Casting==
In addition to a [[verbal component]], the casting of this spell required a single ''masterwork arrow''.
