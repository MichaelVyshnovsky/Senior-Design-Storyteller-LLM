'''''Protection from specific lycanthropes, 10' radius''''' was a [[spell]] that protected the recipient from a specific type of [[lycanthrope]].

==Effects==
This spell protected the caster or another individual from only a specified type of lycanthrope. The specified lycanthrope was unable to get within 10 feet (3 meters) of the recipient. The caster had to learn the spell for each separate type of lycanthrope. Lycanthropes of a type not targeted by this spell could cross the protection barrier.

==Casting==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], [[wolfsbane]]. During casting, the wolfsbane was crushed and then cast in a circle around the caster.
