        "mainbody": "Tremorsense was a transmutation spell that temporarily gave the caster tremorsense.\nOn casting tremorsense, the caster gained tremorsense that had a range of up to 30 feet (9 meters).\nTremorsense required somatic and verbal components. When an arcane caster tried to cast the spell, a bit of skin from a creature with natural tremorsense was required as focus, while divine casters needed their divine focus.\nCreatures from the Underdark used boots of tremorsense, which could only be built by people with access to the tremorsense spell."
