Cloudburst was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell turned all moisture in the air into a heavy rain. This rain was able to extinguish normal and magical fire. If the fire was large enough, the rain would turn to steam, lasting up to four times longer than the original duration of the spell. The spell was affected by the local climate and temperature in the area.  
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required two material components, a small kite and rock salt.
