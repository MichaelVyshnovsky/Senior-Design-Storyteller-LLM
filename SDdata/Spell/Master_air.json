        "mainbody": "Master earth was a transmutation spell used by druids.\nThis spell caused the caster to sprout a pair of feathery or bony wings from their back, allowing them to fly about. Flying in this manner required the same amount of concentration as walking, so the caster could perform any additional act while flying that they could normally do while walking.\nThe magic of the spell failed slowly when the spell ended, allowing the caster ample time to get back to solid ground before being stranded in the air. The spell would also end slowly if cancelled by a dispel magic spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a wing feather from a bird or a wing bone from a bat to cast."
