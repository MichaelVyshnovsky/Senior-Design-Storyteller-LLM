        "mainbody": "'''''Arboreal scamper''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], the Forest Gnome. It allowed one or more creatures to climb, hang, and jump through the trees like a [[squirrel]].",
        "Effects": "The caster had to touch the target(s) of this spell during casting. The duration for a single creature was three hours (longer for more experienced casters). Bestowing ''arboreal scamper'' on more creatures reduced the duration for each, divided equally, with a minimum of thirty minutes per target. The targets had to be [[human]]-sized or smaller (no scampering [[ogre]]s, sorry) and have bare hands and feet with which to grip trees. The unencumbered movement rate was half that of a real squirrel, and encumbrance slowed a creature by half again. Jumping from limb to limb was a test of agility limited to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}, but even if a bespelled creature missed a branch, they could easily grab any other tree limb with which they came in contact, hopefully preventing a disastrous fall. Recipients of this spell could end its effects before they expired by uttering a certain command word.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s plus the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]]."
