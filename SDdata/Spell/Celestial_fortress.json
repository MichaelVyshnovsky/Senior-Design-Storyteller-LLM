        "mainbody": "'''''Celestial fortress''''' was a type of [[sanctified]] [[spell]].",
        "Effects": "This spell was similar to ''[[Leomund's secure shelter]]'' spell but with some key differences. When cast, the spell created a secure fort with a flat roof, strong door and no windows. It has a fireplace and a strong hatch to give access to the roof.\n\nThe fort vibrated with the energy of the home plane of the caster's [[deity]]. The physical appearance of the fort depended on the deity of the caster. In addition to being phsyically secure, it was protected against attacks with ''[[consecrate]]'' and ''[[magic circle against evil]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[divine focus]] and a sacrifice of the caster's health."
