        "mainbody": "Celestial fortress was a type of sanctified spell.\nThis spell was similar to Leomunds secure shelter spell but with some key differences. When cast, the spell created a secure fort with a flat roof, strong door and no windows. It has a fireplace and a strong hatch to give access to the roof.\nThe fort vibrated with the energy of the home plane of the casters deity. The physical appearance of the fort depended on the deity of the caster. In addition to being phsyically secure, it was protected against attacks with consecrate and magic circle against evil.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus and a sacrifice of the casters health."
