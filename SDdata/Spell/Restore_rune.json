        "mainbody": "Restore rune was a divine alteration and abjuration spell from the divination and guardian spheres that caused writings to appear.\nWhen placed upon a large surface restore rune caused all normal and magical writings that had ever been placed upon the surface to appear clearly. If multiple writings appeared the caster selected one to read and study and the others vanished. The caster could choose to restore any triggers for revealed writings.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pinch of powdered gemstone, a piece of chalk, and three twigs from any plant bound together to form a triangle to cast.\nRestore rune was granted to priests of Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs."
