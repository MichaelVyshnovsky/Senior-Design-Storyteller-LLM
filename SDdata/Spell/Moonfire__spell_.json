        "mainbody": "Moonfire was a divine necromancy spell that released a blast of lunar energy that was particularly harmful to the undead.\nWhen this spell was cast, the cleric shot forth a broad beam of \"white fire\". The blast of moonfire was cold, rather than hot, and shot forth in 10-foot-wide (3.0 meter) arc that extended out for 30 feet (9.1 meters).\nIn addition to damaging and chilling those caught in its blast, moonfire revealed any magical auras, repelled electrical bolts, and greatly damaged the undead.\nThis spell was contained within the rings that composed the Moonweb.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
