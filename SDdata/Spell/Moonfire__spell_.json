        "mainbody": "'''''Moonfire''''' was a [[divine]] [[necromancy]] spell that released a blast of lunar energy that was particularly harmful to the [[undead]].",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the [[cleric]] shot forth a broad beam of \"white fire\". The blast of ''moonfire'' was cold, rather than hot, and shot forth in 10-foot-wide (3.0 meter) arc that extended out for 30 feet (9.1 meters).\n\nIn addition to damaging and chilling those caught in its blast, ''moonfire'' revealed any [[magic]]al [[aura]]s, repelled electrical bolts, and greatly damaged the [[undead]].",
        "History": "This spell was contained within the [[ring]]s that composed ''[[the Moonweb]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
