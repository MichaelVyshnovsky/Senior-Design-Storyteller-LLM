Bless was an enchantment or conjuration spell that temporarily increased the morale and combat skill of allies. The conjuration version of this spell was reversible and was called curse, also known as bane, and temporarily lowered the morale and combat skill of enemies.
Those allies blessed were granted a brief boost to their morale in the face of fear and a slight improvement in combat skill that increased their chance to strike a blow or aim true.
The conjuration version of this spell had to be cast just before the recipients engaged in combat. It could also be used to enhance a single weapon or item, such as a sword, an arrow, or a sling bullet, improving the chance to hit an enemy.
Bless countered and dispelled bane or curse, and vice versa.
The sundering version of the spell could only effect 3 allies and gave a minor bonus to attacks and recistence to effects. If used with more skill the spell could effect a higher number of targets. Unlike the earlier versions this does effect the Bane spell
The enchantment version of this spell required verbal and somatic components and the casters holy symbol or divine focus. The conjuration version also required (un)holy water. The sundering version required a sprinkle of holy water.
