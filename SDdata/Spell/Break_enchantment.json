        "mainbody": "'''''Break enchantment''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that released a subject from detrimental effects.",
        "Effects": "''Break enchantment'' released the target from the effects of [[enchantment]]s, [[transmutation]]s, and [[curse]]s. Special about this spell was that it could also reverse effects that had no time of expiration, such as petrification by means of ''[[flesh to stone]]'', provided the caster was skilled enough and the magic to be reversed not of too high complexity.\n\nApart from those limits, ''break enchantment'' was useless when it came to breaking a curse on [[magic item]]s. It could only break a curse on a person. However, it conferred no immunity from the same or other curses. Therefore, if the target was exposed to the same cursed object, he or she could be cursed with the same affliction again.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s to cast."
