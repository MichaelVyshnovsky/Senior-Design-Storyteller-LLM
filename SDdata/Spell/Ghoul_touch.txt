Ghoul touch was a necromancy spell that could paralyze a single target.
When ghoul touch was in effect, the touch of the caster had a chance to paralyze their victim. However, the deadly touch would only affect humans, halflings, dwarves, half-elves, and gnomes. The more powerful the caster, the longer the duration of the paralysis was.
As well as paralyzing the target, the spell would make the target emit a nausea-inducing stench, causing those caught within  to have a higher chance to miss their attacks.
The spell required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component could either be a piece of cloth from the garments of a ghoul or some earth where the ghoul had made its lair.
