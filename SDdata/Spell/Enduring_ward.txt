'''''Enduring ward''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priestesses devoted to [[Nephthys]] called [[Goodwive]]s and resembled the ''[[permanency]]'' [[wizard]] spell..

==Effects==
The spell made any ''[[glyph of warding]]'', ''[[symbol]]'' or [[wards sphere]] spell permanent if cast after those spells. ''Enduring ward'' affected only one spell at a time. The ''enduring ward'' could be negated by either a ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'' spell, but the actual warding spell or symbol remained intact for its normal duration.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a crushed [[diamond]] worth at least 200 [[gp]] to cast.
