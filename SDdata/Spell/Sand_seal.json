        "mainbody": "Sand seal was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWith this spell a wizard was able to create a solid barrier of sand capable of barring a doorway.\nWizards with more power were able to create sand seals that were more resilient to attack. The sand seal had a small chance to utterly shatter a weapon striking it.\nThis spell required a handful of sand and a small lump of wax as material components in order to cast."
