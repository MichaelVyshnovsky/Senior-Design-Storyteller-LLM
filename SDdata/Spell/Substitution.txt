'''''Substitution''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
Shugenja used this spell to transfer a limited amount of damage from themselves to a small figurine. When cast, the shugenja offered a suitable gift to their [[deity]]. The shugenja was required to have demonstrated great faith to their deity in the past. After the spell was successfully cast, it took effect immediately. If a shugenja is struck a blow, a portion of the damage is transferred to the figurine, bruising or cuts appeared on it. The spell was not cumulative, a shugenja could not cast this spell more than once at a time.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small statue of their deity made from materials worth at least five [[ch'ien]].
