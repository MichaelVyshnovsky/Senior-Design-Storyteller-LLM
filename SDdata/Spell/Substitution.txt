Substitution was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Shugenja used this spell to transfer a limited amount of damage from themselves to a small figurine. When cast, the shugenja offered a suitable gift to their deity. The shugenja was required to have demonstrated great faith to their deity in the past. After the spell was successfully cast, it took effect immediately. If a shugenja is struck a blow, a portion of the damage is transferred to the figurine, bruising or cuts appeared on it. The spell was not cumulative, a shugenja could not cast this spell more than once at a time.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small statue of their deity made from materials worth at least five chien.
