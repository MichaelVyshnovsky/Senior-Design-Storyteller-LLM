'''''Brilliant energy arrow''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that changed the properties of an [[arrow]] or [[bolt]].

==Effects==
''Brilliant energy arrow'' was a spell that could only be cast on an arrow or bolt of masterful quality touched by the caster. The enchanted projectile's head started to shed light like a [[torch]]. Its other property was an inability to cause harm to lifeless matter like [[undead]], [[construct]]s, and objects in general. This came with the ability to pass through armor, effectively ignoring its defenses. Said duration was very short. The caster had only enough time to cast the spell and shoot it within the six seconds after its casting as the magic dissipated after that time.

==Components==
''Brilliant energy arrow'' required [[verbal]] and [[material component]]s. The latter was the arrow or bolt of masterful quality on which the spell was cast.
