Improved spider climb was an uncommon spell used by drow. It was very rarely used by other races.
This spell was a stronger version of spider climb. The caster or a target creature was able to easily climb vertical surfaces and could even hang upside down. The recipient was able to cast spells, while objects thrown at them would not stick to them. A strong enough force or impact was able to separate the recipient from a surface, thus breaking the spell otherwise, the spell was ended by speaking a command word. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component a drop of pitch or tree gum. This was consumed by the recipient of the spell during casting. If cast on another creature, physical contact was required during casting.
