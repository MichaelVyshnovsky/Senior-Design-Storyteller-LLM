        "mainbody": "Enhance plant was a spell common for hedge wizards and other nature specialists. It enhanced a plant.\nThe spell allowed a single natural plant (thus excluding shambling mounds and hangman trees amongst others) to be enhanced in one aspect, such as faster growth, sweeter fruit, broader leaves, and so on. The effect was not reversible by dispel magic, nor did it carry over to its offspring.\nThe spell required both verbal and somatic components, as well as a material component, possibly the plant to be enhanced."
