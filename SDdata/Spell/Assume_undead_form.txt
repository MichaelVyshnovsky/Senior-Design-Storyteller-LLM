Assume undead form was an arcane and divine spell used by necromancers and priests devoted to Velsharoon.
With this spell the caster could temporarily transform themselves into an undead creature with which they were familiar. While "undead" the caster had the full range of the selected creatures abilities with the exception that victims slain by the undead form would not rise as undead. The undead form also held all of the inherent weaknesses of that particular form. Hence, a caster assuming the form of a vampire would be vulnerable to sunlight. The caster was unable to cast any of their memorized spells or use any of their special abilities while in undead form.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small piece of bone or flesh from the desired undead body to cast.
