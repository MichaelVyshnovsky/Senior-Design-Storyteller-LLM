        "mainbody": "Instant regeneration was a powerful spell commonly used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nUsing this spell, a wu jen was able to instantly regenerate a severed limp. The spell was only able to regenerate an existing appendage, it was unable to create a new one. The wu jen experienced no discomfort from the effects of the spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of yellow paper with red writing."
