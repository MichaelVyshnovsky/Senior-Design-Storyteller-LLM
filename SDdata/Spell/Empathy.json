        "mainbody": "'''''Empathy''''', known as '''''know motivation''''' in [[Kara-Tur]], was a very rare spell used by [[cleric]]s and [[shugenja]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to feel the basic drives, needs, or emotions of a creature. The spell did not function if the creature was protected against detection, nor did it work on [[psionic]] creatures or creatures with no emotion.\n\nThe reverse of the spell was ''[[mask emotion]]'', called ''[[mask motivation]]'' in Kara-Tur. It concealed the basic drives, needs or emotions of a creature for up to one full day.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: the [[holy symbol]] of the caster. A different material component was required for a shugenja. They tied a strip of cloth around their head, upon which a prayer was written."
