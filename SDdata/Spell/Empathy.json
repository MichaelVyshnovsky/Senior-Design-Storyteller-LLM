        "mainbody": "Empathy, known as know motivation in Kara-Tur, was a very rare spell used by clerics and shugenja.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to feel the basic drives, needs, or emotions of a creature. The spell did not function if the creature was protected against detection, nor did it work on psionic creatures or creatures with no emotion.\nThe reverse of the spell was mask emotion, called mask motivation in Kara-Tur. It concealed the basic drives, needs or emotions of a creature for up to one full day.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component the holy symbol of the caster. A different material component was required for a shugenja. They tied a strip of cloth around their head, upon which a prayer was written."
