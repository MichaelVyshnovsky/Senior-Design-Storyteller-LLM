        "mainbody": "The '''''Wave''''' was a [[magic]]al [[halberd]] associated with the deity [[Umberlee]].",
        "Description": "It had the appearance of a regular halberd, albeit significantly more ornate. The crystalline axe-blade, pick, and pike head were all outfitted with additional spikes, and always felt wet to the touch. The shaft was fashioned from [[aquamarine]] stone, and was carved with depictions of waves.",
        "Powers": "The halberd drained its victims of water, delivering a blast of cold magic in the process. Wielding the ''Wave'', a person could instantly slay [[fire elemental]]s, [[salamander]]s, and [[efreet]].",
        "History": "The ''Wave'' was forged in the ancient past by a cult of Umberlee worshipers, designed as a weapon of vengeance against a band of [[fire giant]]s in the [[Storm Horns]] who had stolen a holy artifact. The cult entrusted the ''Wave'' to their champion, who went on a solitary quest to retrieve the artifact. The champion never returned, and the ''Wave'' was considered lost.\n\nThe halberd was eventually found by [[Arganon]], an adventurer from [[Long Reach]]. While voyaging the [[Sea of Swords]], Arganon's ship sunk in a terrible storm, and the ''Wave'' was lost once more. The halberd was speculated to either rest with Arganon's bones on the ocean floor, or to have been gambled away by the adventurer on a trip to [[Sigil]]. In actuality, both assumptions were accurate: the ''Wave'' had been broken in two. As of [[1368 DR]], the weapon's shaft was held by the [[demon]]ic warden of a planar prison, while the blade was in the possession of the [[sahuagin]] prince [[Villynaty]] of the [[City of Caverns]]."
