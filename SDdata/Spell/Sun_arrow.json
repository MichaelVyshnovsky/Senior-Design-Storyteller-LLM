        "mainbody": "Sun arrow was a type of offensive arcane spell from the southern nation of wizards â€“ Halruaa.\nWhen summoned, the spells energies formed a heated arrow of sunlight that spun towards its target. The sun arrow left charred and smoking burn wounds on its target but was not necessarily lethal but still agonizingly painful. Like with most other types of magic, Halruaan jordainis were trained to defend themselves from the sun arrow spell with a single smooth motion. However, there was a mundane method of countering the spell. A reflective surface, like a shard of glass, a mirror, or a polished brass platter, reflected the spell and, with a skillful application, could be sent back onto its caster.\nIn the , a young talented spell-slinger Tzigone, taught her jordaini ally Matteo to use reflective surfaces to harmlessly bounce sun arrow spells away. The skill he used to his masters, Procopio Septus delight, to deflect magics back at the \"assassin\" sent for testing the young jordainis skills. A simple use of a polished dish left the wizard rolling on the ground in agony and in need of a cleric."
