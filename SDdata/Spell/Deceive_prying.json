The caster or creature touched by the caster gave away this false information when mentally examined by magical or psionic means. The spell provided surface thoughts depending on the set criteria to be read by the examiner.\nThe spell also provided minor protection against spells that were directed at mentally controlling the recipient, while not hindering the mental activity of the same, including mental magical activity..\nThis spell required only material, verbal and somatic components to cast."
