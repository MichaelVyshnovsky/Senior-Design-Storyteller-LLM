It temporarily altered or enhanced the hue of one object, and could be used on hair or skin.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and the effects lasted thirty days. This cantrip could change the hue of one object no larger than  and also worked on hair or the skin of one creature. Faded colors, such as dyed cloth or pigments in a painting, could be brought back to vibrancy, or a completely new color could be applied.\nThe verbal component of this cantrip was a hum and somatic component could be either waving a hand back and forth as if painting, or making a wringing motion with both hands."
