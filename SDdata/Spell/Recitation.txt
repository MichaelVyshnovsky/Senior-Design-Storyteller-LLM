'''''Recitation''''' was an [[abjuration]]/[[evocation]] spell that invoked a deity's blessing on a battle; aiding the caster and any allies while hindering any enemies in the area of effect. A later version of this spell fell under the divine domain of [[creation]], within the school of [[conjuration]].

==Effects==
This spell was cast by reading out loud a passage or declaration of a sacred text related to the caster's religion. For the duration of the spell, the caster and all allies were given a boost to their combat skills and made to strike harder against their foes. Allies of the same religion were given extra luck and strength. Likewise, all enemies were confused and doubtful and made unable to muster their full strength in combat. The area of effect was a 60 ft (18.3 m) circle centered on the caster. Once the spell was completed, the caster was free to do other things.

This spell stacked with ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' and ''[[chant]]'' so that the effects of any two or all three spells were cumulative.

==Components==
[[Somatic]] gestures were required as the priest read the holy text out loud while holding or wearing a [[holy symbol]].
