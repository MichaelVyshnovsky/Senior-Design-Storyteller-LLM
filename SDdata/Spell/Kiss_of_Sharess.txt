'''''Kiss of Sharess''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Sharess]] called [[Sensate]]s, enabling them to grant a target's wish.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to grant a target's most pleasurable wish similar to the ''[[limited wish]]'' spell. The spell found the desired wish deep within the target's subconscious, so neither the caster or the target had direct control over what was selected. The effects of the ''kiss of Sharess'' lasted until sunrise the following morning. This spell had a knack for being not quite as pleasurable as expected when the target returned to their normal life.

==Components==
This spell required only [[somatic component]]s to cast.
