The illusion was also physical. The spell could be cast on individuals as well. Only certain spells such as true seeing or true sight would dispel the illusion.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components. \nDeceiver genies were able to naturally cast this spell once per week.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Smolyn in , then called Smolyns veil."
