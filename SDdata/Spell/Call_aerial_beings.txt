Call aerial beings was a divine conjuration spell from the summoning sphere that summoned aerial creatures to the casters location.
This spell only functioned when cast outdoors. The caster would begin casting the spell and not cease until either an aerial creature arrived or twenty minutes passed. Three separate calls could be made for different creatures. However, the caster would not be able to call different creatures when the first call was answered. The likeliness of the creatures obeying the casters commands depended on the nature of the caster and the creatures in question.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a feather from three separate aerial creatures to cast.
Aerdrie Faenya, a goddess of the Seldarine, granted this spell to her clerics.
