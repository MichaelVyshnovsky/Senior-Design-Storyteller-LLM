'''''Harper's call''''' was a [[cleric]] [[spell]] used by members of the [[Harpers]].

==Effects==
This necromantic spell was very similar to ''[[raise dead]]''. It allowed the caster to resurrect a single creature, but the caster also had to sacrifice some of their own life force. The target would be revived at the lowest health possible, as well as temporarily becoming less wise, robust, strong, intelligent, and dexterous. The target also had to gain the rest of their life force via curative or natural [[magic]]. The spell had a range of {{SI|30|ft}}.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1369 DR]], the spell was known to be used by [[Jaheira]], a Harper companion of [[Gorion's Ward]].
