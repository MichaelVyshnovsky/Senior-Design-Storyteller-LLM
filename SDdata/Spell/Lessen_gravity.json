        "mainbody": "'''''Lessen gravity''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] used to weaken gravity's pull within a targeted area. This spell was created by [[Darsson Spellmaker]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to reduce the pull of gravity to a quarter of it's normal force within an area. The area of effect was determined by the skill of the caster.\n\nFlying creatures passing through the area typically experienced trouble compensating for the change in force. The inertia of missiles passing through the area caused them to remain unaffected, but missiles fired from within the area traveled at a much higher speed.\n\nThis spell could be cast by multiple casters for a cumulative effect, with three castings creating a weightless environment.",
        "Components": "This spell required verbal and somatic components to cast."
