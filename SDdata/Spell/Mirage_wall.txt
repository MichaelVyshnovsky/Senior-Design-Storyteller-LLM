}}'''''Mirage wall''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell created an illusionary wall wherever the caster could see. The wall was not confined to a rectangular shape and could be of any shape the caster desired. The wall could be used to cloak living creatures or to create any kind of scene the caster wished. The mirage wall would disappear if the caster willed it, a ''[[dispel magic]]'' or similar spell was cast upon it, or if a living creature walked through it.

==Components==
This spell required an eyelash, a pinch of [[sand]], and some sweat to cast.
