Water summoning was a spell unique to Maztica.
A caster used this spell to summon forth water from the ground, even parched earth. The water appeared as a vertical stream, rising up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) in height. The water continued spouting from the ground until the spell expired. The amount of water summoned was determined by the casters skill level.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
