Maw of chaos was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration and evocation.
This spell created a spectral mouth measuring  across and filled with teeth. The maw lacked a physical form and could be moved about with the casters concentration.
The maw could be instantly destroyed if struck by a weapon physically wielded by an attacker, greatly harming the attacker in the process and feebleminding them if they were a spellcaster. The maw was impervious to all other attacks.
When positioned where the caster wanted, the maw emitted a wave of purple-red light in a cylindrical ray of chaos measuring  in diameter and  long. This ray of chaos lasted for two minutes before dissipating. Anything touching the ray of chaos was subjected to the following effects
* All magic items did not function for two to five minutes after the ray expired.
* Spellcasters were prevented from casting spells and psionicists were prevented from using psionics while within the ray. After breaking contact with the ray their ability to use their lost powers depended on their willpower which became easier to regain with each passing minute.
* All magical barriers and similar effects, including illusions, were destroyed on contact with the ray.
* All beings, with the exception of the caster, suffered harm from the chaotic energy of the ray. This harm was even greater for the undead.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a jawbone from any creature to cast.
