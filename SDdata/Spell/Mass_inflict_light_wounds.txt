Mass inflict light wounds was a necromancy spell that applied an enhanced inflict light wounds to a small group of creatures.
When this spell was cast, the caster channeled negative energy which did harm to living beings. Since undead were powered by negative energy, this spell cured them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them. No more than one creature per level of the caster could receive this spell and they all had to be within 30 ft (9.1 m) of each other, but the caster was not required to touch the recipients.
