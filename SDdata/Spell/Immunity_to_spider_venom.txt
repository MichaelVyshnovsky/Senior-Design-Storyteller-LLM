Immunity to spider venom was an arcane abjuration spell, used in the Underdark, which would allow the target to become immune to all effects of arachnid venom, digestive secretions or internal fluids.
The spell would work on any creature that the caster touched, including themselves. Once cast, the recipient was immune to all venom from arachnids. The recipient would also become slightly more resistant to other types of venom, acid, or poison.
As well as verbal and somatic components, the material component consisted of a fully intact spider, of any size, alive or dead.
