        "mainbody": "'''''Rune of power''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the [[guardian sphere]] that created powerful [[magic]]al inscriptions.",
        "Effects": "The power of this spell was related to the skill of the caster. The triggers for each rune, or outlining things that would not trigger the rune, was set by the caster during the casting. A ''rune of power'' could be drawn to any size larger than the caster's hand. Most ''runes of power'' duplicated the harmful effects of various [[wizard]] spells. Some examples are listed below:\n\n* ''Alhalbrin'' melted metal on contact or that passed the rune.\n* ''Faerindyl'' created a ricocheting ''[[flaming sphere]]''. \n* ''Sabras'' created a ''[[blade barrier]]''.\n* ''Thundaril'' ''[[polymorph]]ed'' the creature that activated the rune.\n* ''Velurndyn'' created a ''[[reverse gravity]]'' field.\n\nSome ''runes of power'' took immediate effect upon being placed. Some examples are listed below:\n\n* ''Bhelaerak'' acted like ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]''.\n* ''Corsimmyr'' acted like ''[[passwall]]''.\n* ''Delhaubrin'' acted like ''[[shatter]]''.\n* ''Elemsyr'' acted like ''[[invisibility]]'' for a single creature or object.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the casting [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] to cast. The holy symbol was used to trace the rune.",
        "History": "''Runes of power'' used to be able to be used by all [[dwarves]] on [[Toril]] with varying degrees of power and success based upon their training and skill. An incredibly powerful ''rune of power'' once destroyed the city of [[Dharrmaghongh]] in [[Murgh√¥m]]."
