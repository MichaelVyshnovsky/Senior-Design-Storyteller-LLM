'''''Truename''''' was a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[enchantment]] and [[alteration]] [[spell]] that granted tremendous power over any creature that had a [[true name]].

==Effects==
If the caster was able to determine the true name of a creature after extensive research, that name was called out during the casting and followed by a recitation of the history of the creature. The caster could then decide to ''[[polymorph]]'' the creature, give them multiple ''[[suggestion]]s'', transport the creature to a desired location, weaken them to the point of surrender, or utterly dominate the creature to the point where they behaved like a slave or loyal servant.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
The ''truename'' spell was originally developed in the [[Outer Planes]] that leaned towards [[law]]ful [[alignment]]. At some point, this spell was inscribed within the ''[[Tome of Shaping Secrets]]''.

==Notable Users==
This spell was especially popular among people on the plane of [[Acheron]].
