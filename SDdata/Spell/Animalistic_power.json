        "mainbody": "'''''Animalistic power''''' was an [[arcane]] and [[divine]] [[transmutation]] [[spell]] from the second circle of magic that strengthened the target with an aspect of the natural world. It could be used by a wide variety of spellcasters: [[cleric]]s,[[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "With a simple touch, the caster imbued the target with an aspect of natural world, boosting their physical strength, dexterity, and constitution. The spell's effect was apparent from a sparkling green glow that momentarily surrounded the target creature. Once the glow was gone, the target creature appeared more feral and bigger in size.",
        "Components": "The spell required a [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. Its material component was a tuft of beast fur, a handful of feathers, or a chunk of skin."
