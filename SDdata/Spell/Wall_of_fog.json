        "mainbody": "Wall of fog was an evocation spell that filled a volume with obscuring vapors.\nThe spell created a mist of vapors in a volume up to a cube 20 ft (6.1 m) on a side, but no thinner than 10 ft (3 m) within a range of up to 30 yd (27 m). The mist completely obscured both normal vision and infravision beyond 2 ft (61 cm) into the volume. More powerful wizards could increase the volume of mist produced. It lasted for about three minutes, but could be dispersed by a moderate or strong wind.\nSince the spell created air along with the vapors, it could be used to renew the air supply of a spelljammer that had spent too long in wildspace. Any excess air that could not fit within the air envelope escaped to space. Despite the temporary obscuring effect, the new air created remained even after the spells duration.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a pinch of split dried peas.\nThe spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Veridon in , originally called Veridons wall."
