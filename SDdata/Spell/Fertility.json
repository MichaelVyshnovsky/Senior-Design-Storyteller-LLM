        "mainbody": "Fertility was a divine necromancy spell used by specialty priests devoted to Shiallia called Woodwives, that had two distinct effects.\nThe first use of this spell was similar to the plant growth spell but affecting  and increasing the general health and yields of the affected plants.\nThe second use of this spell was as a blessing to marriage, practically guaranteeing pregnancy, either by impregnating if cast upon a male target or becoming pregnant if cast upon a female target, within one full day of the spells casting.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a seed to cast."
