        "mainbody": "Marthammors thunderbolts was a spell used by clerics of Marthammor Duin.\nWhen cast, this spell unleashed bolts of lightning from the eyes and hands of the caster. The caster was capable of striking a target up to  away. The lightning had no effect on objects and could be blocked by barriers. They also did not fork nor rebound off of a surface.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Marthammor Duin."
