Blinding spittle was a spell used by druids.
When cast, the spell turned the casters saliva into a caustic liquid. The caster then spat into the eyes of a targeted creature. The caster was able to strike a creature within , this range increased with the casters skill level. The caustic salivia only harmed the eyes of a creature and had no effect if used on a creature without eyes.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
