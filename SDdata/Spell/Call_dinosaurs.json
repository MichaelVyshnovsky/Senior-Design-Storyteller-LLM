        "mainbody": "Call dinosaurs was a divine conjuration spell used only by shamans devoted to Ubtao called spiritlords.\nThrough this spell the Children of Ubtao, better known as dinosaurs, provided Ubtaos divine aid through the course of their actions. A large dinosaur, or group of smaller dinosaurs, were compelled to travel at top speed to reach the caster and provide aid. The caster was unable to specify the type of dinosaur that would answer the call. Though not under the casters control, the dinosaurs did what the caster indicated would help them so long as it paralleled the will of Ubtao.\nCall dinosaur served as a minor form of divine intervention from Ubtao. As such, the dinosaurs answering the call were usually the ones best suited to provide the caster with the aid they needed most. The dinosaurs would recede back into the jungle after their single task was completed.\nSpiritlords who abused this spells power by calling aid during a hunt met gruesome ends by the very dinosaur that answered the call.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the shamans holy symbol to cast."
