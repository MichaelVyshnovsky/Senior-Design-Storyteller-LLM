        "mainbody": "Reward was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA shugenja used this spell to give a gift to a creature who performed an exceptional deed or who was exceptionally faithful. The spell was very limited in its use and a shugenja was unable to cast this spell on them-self. The gift was given by the shugenjas deity and was appropriate for the deed. If the gift was kept by the shugenja or was stolen, the offendent suffered the same effects as ancient curse. Conversely, if the creature was naturally greedy, their reward was such that it brought humility or misfortune upon them.\nIn addition to a verbal component, the spell required a material component, and must be cast within a temple of the shugenjas deity."
