        "mainbody": "'''''Reward''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to give a gift to a creature who performed an exceptional deed or who was exceptionally faithful. The spell was very limited in its use and a shugenja was unable to cast this spell on them-self. The gift was given by the shugenja's [[deity]] and was appropriate for the deed. If the gift was kept by the shugenja or was stolen, the offendent suffered the same effects as ''[[ancient curse]]''. Conversely, if the creature was naturally greedy, their reward was such that it brought humility or misfortune upon them.",
        "Components": "In addition to a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component, the spell required a [[material component]], and must be cast within a temple of the shugenja's deity."
