Conflagration was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell set a living target ablaze, burning at least the first layer of flesh from its body. Living creatures standing within  of the target also risked catching fire.
Items carried by the target usually caught fire and were destroyed, fueling the blaze even further.
Attempting to douse the flames with water or sand caused a  cloud of burning vapor to surround the target. Complete immersion of the target under huge amounts of sand or water greatly reduced the burning vapor but did not douse the flames.
Once killed by the flames, the target rose as an undead servant under the casters command. The caster was unable to cast other spells while controlling the undead.
This spell required a material component in the form of a wax doll to cast.
