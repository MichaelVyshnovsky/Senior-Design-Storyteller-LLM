'''''Sword of darkness''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[wu jen]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, a black sword was created. The sword radiated pure evil. The spell required great concentration from the caster and the sword was only able to target a single creature. When struck, a part of the targeted creature's life force was drained. This caused the creature to weaken, both physically and magically, but there was no actual physical damage. It took several days for the creature to recover its full strength and spellcasting abilities. The spell had the opposite effect on an [[undead]] creature. In [[Kara-Tur]], if a creature was killed with this spell, they returned as a [[kuei]].

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a [[longsword]] or [[katana]] valued at least 20 [[gp]].
