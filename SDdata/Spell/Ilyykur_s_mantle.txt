'''''Ilyykur's mantle''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that gave the caster some protection against various types of [[magic]]al attacks.

==Effects==
This spell gave the caster a protective aura that covered the body in a soft, form-fitting glow. ''Ilyykur's mantle'' was particularly good at protecting the caster from [[enchantment]]/[[charm]] spells, but also granted a minimal boost to protection from all other types of spells. One additional feature was that all damage from electrical attacks, such as ''[[lightning bolt]]'' or ''[[shocking grasp]]'', was reduced by half.

If the caster had a small [[familiar]] with which it maintained contact, then the familiar was afforded the same magical protection.

The spell's duration was a matter of minutes, depending on the power and experience of the caster.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a natural, uncut, unpolished [[gem]] of any value.

==History==
This spell was published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community.
