        "mainbody": "Irithras Spelltouch was a spell created by Irithra Dawntanthra.\nThis spell allowed another spell, cast in an object, to be triggered by the touch of a pre-selected creature. The effect could hang for about a half hour at least, or more for better mages. Though the conditions for the creature selection were allowed to be specific, they could only react to very general characteristics, such as race, sex, and type (which meant, for the purposes of this spell, something as general as living, dead, summoned, or perhaps even avian).\nTwo objects with this spell cancelled each others spells if within . The destruction of an item also cancelled the spell.\nBesides verbal and somatic components, the spell called for a pinch of powdered gemstone, ash left by an object burnt by a spell, and a drop of water.\nThe spell was developed by Irithra Dawntanthra, and later used to assassinate Unamundass, a king of Westgate."
