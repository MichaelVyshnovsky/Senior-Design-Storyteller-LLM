'''''Horizikaul's versatile vibration''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a cone of powerful sonic vibrations. The targeted creature suffered from sonic damage and was temporarily deafened. The amount of damage inflicted was determined by the caster's skill level. Additionally, the spell could be used to move a creature or object, but only in a direction away from the caster. If the targeted creature was within an area of effect of a ''[[silence]]'' spell, the spell had no effect.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[focus]]: a cone of [[brass]] and [[gold]] that was hollow and worth at least 50 [[gp]].
