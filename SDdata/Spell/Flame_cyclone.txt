Flame cyclone is an evocation spell used by inexperienced swordmages, particularly those of the assault style. When flame cyclone is cast a tempest of magical flame shoots from the swordmages blade, towards a nearby location, exploding into a flaming storm of fifteen feet in diameter. Creatures caught within are scorched by this blast, which dissipates within a few seconds and which is powered primarily by the strength and intelligence of the swordmage casting it. Flame cyclone wears somewhat heavily on its casters power, meaning that before a swordmage can cast the spell again he or she must rest at least a few minutes.
