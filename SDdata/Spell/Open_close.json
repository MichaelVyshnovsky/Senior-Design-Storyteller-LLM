        "mainbody": "Open/close was an arcane cantrip that could open or close a light object such as a bag, box, or bottle, or a portal such as a door or a window.\nThis cantrip could open or close (but not both with the same casting) one object of  or less that was within  of the caster (farther for more experienced casters). Heavy doors, chests, or barrels above the weight limit were likely beyond the capability of this cantrip. Likewise, the spell failed on targets that were not in a state where they were easy to open or close. For example, this cantrip was unable to affect barred doors, locked chests, a window with someone leaning out, or even bottles with corks sealed by wire. If, for some reason, the target had willpower or any resistance to magic, then it had a chance to resist this spell and was unaffected if successful.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast, and an arcane focus of a brass key."
