        "mainbody": "'''''Open/close''''' was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[cantrip]] that could open or close a light object such as a bag, box, or [[bottle]], or a portal such as a door or a window.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip could open or close (but not both with the same casting) one object of {{SI|30|lb|k|long=yes}} or less that was within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} of the caster (farther for more experienced casters). Heavy doors, chests, or [[barrel]]s above the weight limit were likely beyond the capability of this cantrip. Likewise, the spell failed on targets that were not in a state where they were easy to open or close. For example, this cantrip was unable to affect barred doors, locked chests, a window with someone leaning out, or even [[bottle]]s with corks sealed by [[wire]]. If, for some reason, the target had willpower or any resistance to [[magic]], then it had a chance to resist this spell and was unaffected if successful.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast, and an [[spell focus|arcane focus]] of a [[brass]] key."
