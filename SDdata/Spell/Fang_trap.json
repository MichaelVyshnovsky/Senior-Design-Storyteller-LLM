        "mainbody": "'''''Fang trap''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that created a spectral set of fanged jaws, which bit down upon any designated creature that passed over an area or manipulated a certain object.",
        "Effects": "The spell functioned in a similar manner to the more common ''[[glyph of warding]]'' in that it created an invisible, magical trigger that would activate when the right conditions were met. A ''fang trap'' was traced over an physical object, such as the handle of a door, a chest, or area on the ground as conditions were determined as to who could spring the trap.\n\nThe trigger could not differentiate people of different faith or alignment, but could distinguish between different races, such as [[scaled ones]] or other [[humanoid]]s. The condition could also be quite specific such as those wearing certain items, e.g. someone wearing exactly \"six metal rings\" upon their fingers. The caster of the spell could never be caught within their own ''fang trap''.\n\nOnce sprung, a ''fang trap'' immobilized its target and, unless they resisted the effect, a spectral set of fanged jaws bit down upon them.",
        "Casting": "The spell required the use of a [[divine]] focus by [[cleric]]s or the material component of a single fang, extracted from a snake, in the case of [[arcane spellcaster]]s."
