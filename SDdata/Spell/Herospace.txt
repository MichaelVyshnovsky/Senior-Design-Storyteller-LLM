'''Herospace''' was an unusual [[crystal sphere]] with nine planets and nine suns. It was controlled by a group of twenty mages called the Rational Order of Magistrates, who only permitted exceptional individuals to settle on the planets they tended.

==Location==
Herospace had flow currents connecting it to [[Realmspace]], [[Greyspace]], [[Faeriespace]], and [[Darkspace]].

==Solar System==
Herospace was unique in that it had nine small suns, each with only a single planet orbiting it. Each sun was a different color. Because of how the Rational Order of Magistrates operated, each planet was also associated with a different alignment. Only one planet had a moon, Borden, which orbited the planet Ge'Neva.

; Gondorin : The planet orbiting the white sun was an orderly, predictable planet in terms of both nature and society. Its inhabitants were lawful good.

; Hearthguard : The planet orbiting the yellow sun was a harsh, rocky world, and the most sparsely inhabited planet in Herospace, as lawful neutral individuals were not overly inclined to relocate their lives. Despite the desert-like terrain and climate, the Order never received any complaints or had to respond to any troubles there.

; Darkseed : A dark, gloomy planet that received little light from the blood-red sun it orbited, Darkseed was the home of lawful evil individuals. It had a flat, featureless terrain and many who ventured out of sight of a landmark got lost.

; Cumberland : Orbiting a light orange sun was the planet of Cumberland, domain of neutral good individuals. It had the most ordinary climate range of the planets of Herospace, and the most social inhabitants.

; Ge'Neva : The haven of the truely neutral, Ge'Neva was home to a great many druids.

; Morgan's World : Morgen's World was a grim and twisted place lit by a dark blue sun; covered in forests of twisted trees and gruesome mountains, inhabited by euqally deformed animals, this was the home of the purely evil. One of its more interesting effects, was that when the sun was not in the sky the atmosphere took on a drug-like effect, causing intelligent humanoids to enter a euphoric state where imagination became reality.

; Woodhaven : The most beautiful planet in Herospace, Woodhaven was home to abundant plant and wildlife and chaotic good individuals. Its population was the most familial, possibly because of the long lifespans of the many elves that lived there. Interestingly, the purple sun seemed to rise everywhere on the planet at the same time. It was known that [[Alustriel Silverhand]] occasionally visited Woodhaven when she desired a break from her official duties in [[Silverymoon]].

; Asylum : A strange planet covered entirely in ruins lit by a gray sun. The only lifeforms native to the planet are a species of nonintelligent humanoid whose activities are deranged and not acceptable for polite conversation. The individuals who inhabit Asylum find that they experience very good luck while there: whatever ruins they move into repair easily, almost overnight, and treasures are easily found. However, none of the treasure can leave the planet.

; Chaostromme : An oddly beautiful place lit by an emerald sun, Chaostromme was home to wild and evil individuals, as well as large numbers of violent and hateful creatures such as goblinoids, giants, and orcs, who have much bloodrage.

==Inhabitants==
Herospace's planets were inhabited by those who were accepted by the Rational Order of Magistrates; the Order itself was composed of ten men and ten women, but employed large numbers of people as military and custodial staff to protect the sphere that was, after a fashion, their investment.
