        "mainbody": "'''''Call upon Gargauth''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Gargauth]] called [[Malefactor]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the malefactor to contact Gargauth regardless of where the [[demigod]] was located to request his divine aid. If the caster's offering or plight piqued Gargauth's interest he might choose to answer the spell's call. While Gargauth would followed the agreement with the caster, he would twist it to his own advantage wherever possible.\n\nGargauth spread rumors that collecting certain valuable [[magic item]]s and casting the spell would allow the caster to control Gargauth when he appeared, but the Outcast simply appeared and took the desired item for himself.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s an unblessed broken horn manifested by Gargauth and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
