'''''Firewater''''' was a [[spell]] of [[alteration]] and the [[Alchemy (school)|alchemy]] [[school of thaumaturgy]] that allowed novice [[wizard]]s to create a flammable substance.

==Effects==
Casting this spell would transform a volume of water into a substance similar to alcohol, but lighter than water. The amount of volume that could be transformed was {{SI|1|pint|l|long=yes}} or more according to the caster's capability, with the highest possible volume being {{SI|10|pint|l|long=yes}}.

This ''firewater'' substance was volatile and flammable, bursting into hot flames at even a spark that lasted for one minute. However, the substance had to be used within a minute of its creation, as otherwise it would evaporate. This would occur even if the substance was in a securely sealed container.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, casting this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a few grains of [[sugar]] and a [[raisin]].
