'''''Symbol''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that was similar to ''[[glyph of warding]]'', creating a rune that had a variety of possible devastating effects when triggered.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Effects==
There was both a [[divine magic|divine]] and an [[arcane magic|arcane]] version of this spell. Both versions had the caster tracing one or more glowing runes in the air or on any solid surface and choosing the triggered effect. Arcane ''symbols'' were triggered by proximity (passing over them, touching them, passing through a portal that had the runes inscribed on it) or by reading them, and were permanent until triggered.

===Known Divine Symbols===
The following symbols were typical divine ''symbols'':
====Hopelessness==== 
Creatures unable to exert enough willpower were forced to retreat or surrender. This effect lasted anywhere from a half hour to three hours.
====Pain====
Unlucky viewers were racked with excruciating pain that made it difficult to attack or dodge. This effect lasted anywhere from 20 minutes to over three hours.
====Persuasion====
Pliable creatures were temporarily converted to the same [[alignment]] as the priest and regarded the priest as a friend. This effect lasted for 10 minutes to over three hours.

===Known Arcane Symbols===
Known arcane ''symbols'' included:
====Death====
Creatures who could not resist the spell's magic were instantly slain. Physical toughness could also prevent certain death.
====Discord====
Excitable creatures would immediately turn and argue among themselves. If they were of different alignment, it was an even bet they would come to blows. It was unknown if a solitary creature would stand and argue with itself.
====Fear====
Those exposed to this ''symbol'' usually fled in panic, similar to an enhanced ''[[fear]]'' spell.
====Hopelessness====
As with the divine version, if their will was overwhelmed by this ''symbol'', those affected retreated, submitted, surrendered, or just stood there for a half hour to three hours.
====Insanity====
If caught with their mental guard down, one or more creatures exposed to this ''symbol'' were driven insane, acting like a ''[[confusion]]'' spell had been cast upon them. The effect lasted until removed with ''[[heal]]'', ''[[restoration]]'', or a ''[[wish]]''.
====Pain====
Same effect as the divine version.
====Sleep====
All who could not resist this ''symbol'' immediately collapsed into a deep catatonic state that lasted fifty minutes to almost three hours, despite all attempts to awaken them.
====Stunning====
One or more without sufficient mental discipline were stunned and staggered about, dropping whatever they were holding. This effect lasted only for a few minutes.

==Components==
One reason the strength, duration, and variety of effects varied widely between divine and arcane ''symbols'' was the material components used in casting the spell. Divine spellcasters needed bit of [[phosphorous]] and a drop of [[mercury]]. Arcane spellcasters had to have 5,000 gp worth each of powdered [[black opal]] and [[diamond]] dust. Both versions required verbal utterances and somatic gestures including the tracing of the rune or runes themselves.

For arcane spellcasters, the symbol itself integrated their personal [[signature rune]]s into symbol.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Hersent]] in {{Yearlink|-1110}} and was originally called ''Hersent's symbol''.
