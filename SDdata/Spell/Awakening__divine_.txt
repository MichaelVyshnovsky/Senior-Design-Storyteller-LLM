'''''Awakening''''' was a [[school of magic|multi-school]] [[divine]] spell that released a wave of light that woke individuals from their sleep and undid a number of [[magic]]al effects.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell radiated light outwards from the caster in all directions for 15 feet (4.6 meters), except for directly in front of the caster, where it extended for 45 feet (13.7 meters). The light awoke any sleeping individuals, ''dispelled'' any [[charm]] magic, and undid the effects of ''[[temporal stasis]]'' and ''[[suspended animation]]'' within its area of effect. Additionally it "unlocked" any ''[[arcane lock]]s'' and sprung any ordinary or magical traps within the area.

There was a chance when ''awakening'' was cast, that none of these effects would occur. Rather, any items or individuals that may have been affected by the spell were surrounded in a faint aura that was only visible to the caster.

==History==
This spell was inscribed within the holy [[relic]], the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]''.

==Components==
''Awakening'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.
