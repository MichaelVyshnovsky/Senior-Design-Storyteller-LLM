        "mainbody": "Animal rage was a spell from the enchantment school of magic, used by druids and rangers.\nWith a touch, the caster could imbue the target with animal ferocity. The spell dramatically boosted the targets physical strength, constitution, and speed and allowed them to more easily avoid danger or shake off the negative effects of enemy spells. On the downside, while under the effect of the animal rage spell, the target was unable to work any sort of magic. The target also flew into a rage when in sight of an enemy and immediately attacked them in mêlée. There was also a small chance of them going berserk. The spell lasted for 90 seconds."
