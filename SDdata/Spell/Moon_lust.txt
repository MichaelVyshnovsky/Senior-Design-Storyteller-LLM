'''''Moon lust''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by [[Silverhair Knights]], an order devoted to [[Eilistraee]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell conjured a compelling enchantment that induced an intense, obsessive fascination with the [[moon]] in a target creature. The targeted creature became wholly captivated by the moon, entering a state of fascination. This state persisted for the spell's entire duration. In instances where the moon was obscured or not visible at the time of casting, the spell's effect shifted from fascination to a state of worry and distraction.

Creatures devoid of sight were immune to the effects of this spell, as the basis of the enchantment relied on the target's ability to perceive the moon.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[focus]] an ingot of [[silver]] with a value of 5 [[gp]].
