Azuths exalted triad was a powerful spell used by clerics of the Church of Azuth.
This powerful spell allowed a caster to cast the same spell several times. The spell had to be prepared and could only be a low-level spell. The desired spell was cast, followed by this one, allowing the caster to cast the prepared spell two more times.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
