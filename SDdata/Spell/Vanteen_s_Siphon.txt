'''''Vanteen's Siphon''''' was a defensive [[wizard]] [[spell]] invented by [[Vanteen]] and recorded in a historical codex that bore his  name.

==Effects==
''Vanteen's Siphon'' was a protective ward that could be placed on a space or a room. The spell's magics became activated when offensive magic was discharged, such as casting a fire spell. Once active, ''Vanteen's Siphon'' started drawing energies from the offensive spellcaster, leaving them weak and shivering on the floor, powerless to continue casting destructive incantations.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a merchant [[wizard]] from [[Neverwinter]], and a companion of the [[Kalach-Cha]], [[Sand (individual)|Sand]], used ''Vanteen's Siphon'' to protect his shop in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]] from magical aggression. Another companion of the Kalach-Cha, a temperamental [[sorceress]] named [[Qara]], threatened to burn down Sand's shop, but was warned against it under a threat of unleashing the ''Vanteen's Siphon''.
