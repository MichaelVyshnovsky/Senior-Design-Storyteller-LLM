Reverse arrows was an abjuration spell used by wizards and sorcerers.
This spell was similar to protection from arrows but all of the harm from a missile striking the caster was negated and the missile was flung back upon its source.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of shell from a tortoise and a ball of tree sap to cast.
