The Maelstroms Eye by Roger E. Moore is book three in the Cloakmaster Cycle, a six-book series for the Spelljammer campaign setting. It begins on the Rock of Bral.
The Probe, now captained by Teldin Moores friend Aelfred Silverhorn, docks at the Rock of Bral so that Teldin can follow a lead given him by the wizard Vallus Leafbower regarding his magic cloak. Vallus had suggested he visit the elves of Evermeet, but Teldin thought that visiting the elven embassy of Bral would suffice. On his way, he passes through the Greater Market of Bral and runs into an exuberant young girl named Gaye, who convinces him to visit a tavern to try some chicken cooked by halflings. After the meal, Teldin is shocked to learn that Gaye is a kender and finds a way to excuse himself and enter the Elven Forest.
