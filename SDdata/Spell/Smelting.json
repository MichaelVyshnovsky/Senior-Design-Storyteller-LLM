        "mainbody": "Smelting was a spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nWith this spell the caster could transform raw ore into fine ingots of pure metal. Smelting took 30 minutes to cast and the effects were permanent. The results of the spell depended greatly on the initial quality of ore. The following yields could be expected\n* high-grade ore released 1 lb. (450 g) of metal per 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of ore\n* low-grade ore released 1 lb. of metal per 100 (450 kg) or possibly even 1,000 lbs (4,500 kg) of ore\nGems or semi-precious stones were unaffected by this spell. The spell would fail if cast upon rock that did not contain ore. Interrupting the spell at any point would cease the transformation process, but even successfully dispelling the magic would not cause the ingots to revert to their ore state. Smelting had no effect on metal or rock-based creatures.\nThe reverse of this spell, sometimes called hide normal metal, caused metal ingots to meld back with the earth and was an effective method of hiding wealth or material.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
