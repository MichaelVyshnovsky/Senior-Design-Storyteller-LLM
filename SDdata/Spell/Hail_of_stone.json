        "mainbody": "'''''Hail of stone''''' was a simple [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a brief hailstorm of rocks to fall upon an opponent. It was common among spellcasters living in the [[Underdark]]",
        "Effects": "After a full six seconds of casting or longer, a localized hailstorm, roughly in the shape of a 40-foot-tall (twelve meters) cylinder with a radius of five feet (one and a half meters), was instantly created wherever the caster designated within a medium range, ending as soon as the initial rain of stones fell. According to some earlier scholars of magic, the radius of the storm grew larger as the caster excelled in magical skill. The \"hail\" were stones heavy enough to cause injury to persons and objects struck.\n\nThe spell could not be cast within the [[phlogiston]] between the [[crystal sphere]]s.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The caster would hold a chip of [[jade]], which was blown upon during the final moments of casting. The chip would spark, burst into a green flame, and vanish, just as the stones began to fall. In the Kara-Turan tradition, the jade chip was instead tossed in the direction of the target."
