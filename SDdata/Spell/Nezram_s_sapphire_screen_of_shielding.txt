Nezrams sapphire screen of shielding was an abjuration spell that had the dubious distinction of having one of the longest names in the school of Abjuration. 
It created a floating, square shaped shield of sapphire blue colored force that protected the target from physical and magical attacks.
This spell was presumably developed by Nezram.
