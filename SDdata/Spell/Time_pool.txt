Time pool was a divine spell that allowed a cleric to enchant a pool of water, revealing specific events from the past.
The spell could summon visions of the past when cast upon a mirror, a pool of water, or any other reflective surface. The images created by the spell were of perfect clarity and realism, as if the cleric witnessed the past being present at the scene. The image lasted accordingly to the spell-casters skills with magics. However, the spell had limitations and did not reveal events that transpired on other planes.
To divine the past via the time pool spell, the caster had to know some details about the event they wanted to witness. The spell was dependant on the verbal request uttered by the priest. The more detailed and eloquent the request was, the more chances the spell had to succeed. Needless to say, the wiser the caster was, the easier time pool was to cast. The success rate went up significantly if the caster observed the event through the spell before.
The spell was impossible to cast while traversing phlogiston.
Time pool required verbal, somatic, and physical components to be cast. Physical components were a reflective surface and a pinch of powdered quartz, while verbal component was the request with the description of the event divined.
