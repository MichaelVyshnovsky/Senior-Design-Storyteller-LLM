        "mainbody": "Wilt was a reversed version of the freshen cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn, but was limited to only vegetable matter, and therefore, it was a unique spell. Wilt caused rapid aging of a plant or small amount of vegetable material.\nThis cantrip only worked on one plant about the size of a bouquet of flowers, or the same amount of cut vegetable matter. It did not affect plant creatures. When cast, leaves drooped, flowers faded, stems sagged, and fruit aged. If the target was already showing signs of decay, wilt caused further withering.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The index finger was held pointing upward, then the caster hummed a quick, descending note while curling the forefinger.\nThe untitled book known as Briels Book of Shadows described this cantrip along with exterminate, tie, and smokepuff.The four cantrips described in Dragon #97 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
