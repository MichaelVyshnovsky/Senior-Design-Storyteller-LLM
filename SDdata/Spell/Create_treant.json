        "mainbody": "Create treant was a powerful divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Mielikki, enabling them to transform a tree into a treant. It was also available to priests of Gwaeron Windstrom\nThis spell was used to create a treant servant out of a tree. It obeyed the caster faithfully for the duration of the spell or until destroyed. The treant would dwindle away into nothing when the spell ended after a matter of days. Larger and stronger treants could be created using a larger spell component.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a twig, bough, shrub, or living tree to cast. This formed the basis of the newborn treant.\nAs a living shrub or tree might be used up by this spell, priests of the church of Mielikki used it only rarely. Druids preferred to use changestaff instead.\nThe goddess Mielikki herself could use this spell at will simply by touching a tree.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
