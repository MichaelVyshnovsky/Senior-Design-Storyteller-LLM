        "mainbody": "'''''Create treant''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]], enabling them to transform a [[tree]] into a [[treant]]. It was also available to priests of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]]",
        "Effects": "This spell was used to create a treant servant out of a tree. It obeyed the caster faithfully for the duration of the spell or until destroyed. The treant would dwindle away into nothing when the spell ended after a matter of days. Larger and stronger treants could be created using a larger spell component.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a twig, bough, shrub, or living tree to cast. This formed the basis of the newborn treant.",
        "Usage": "As a living shrub or tree might be used up by this spell, priests of the [[church of Mielikki]] used it only rarely. [[Druid]]s preferred to use ''[[changestaff]]'' instead.\n\nThe goddess Mielikki herself could use this spell at will simply by touching a tree.<ref>",
        "History": "It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
