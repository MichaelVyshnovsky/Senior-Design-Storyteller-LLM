Water Protection was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur, that negated certain dangers of water. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell protected a creature while in water. It allowed the creature to breathe normally while submerged, and their clothing and equipment remained dry. Even a torch held by the creature would continue burning while underwater. The spell did not have an effect on the movement of the creature, their skill in swimming was not increased. A creature was unable to consume potions or other liquids normally underwater, as the spell did not prevent liquid from mixing with the water.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small fish-shaped statue of gold. The statue had to be held by the creature for the spell to function, releasing or dropping the statue caused the spell to expire instantly.
