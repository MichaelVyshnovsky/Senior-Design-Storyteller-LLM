'''''Water Protection''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]], that negated certain dangers of water. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
This spell protected a creature while in water. It allowed the creature to breathe normally while submerged, and their clothing and equipment remained dry. Even a torch held by the creature would continue burning while underwater. The spell did not have an effect on the movement of the creature, their skill in swimming was not increased. A creature was unable to consume potions or other liquids normally underwater, as the spell did not prevent liquid from mixing with the water.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small fish-shaped statue of gold. The statue had to be held by the creature for the spell to function, releasing or dropping the statue caused the spell to expire instantly.
