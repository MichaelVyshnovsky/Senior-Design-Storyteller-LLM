        "mainbody": "'''''Command plants''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] that afforded the caster some degree of control over plants and [[plant creature]]s. It was known to [[druids]], [[clerics]] with access to the [[Plant domain]], and [[rangers]].",
        "Effects": "The [[spell]] allowed the caster to [[charm]] a handful of plant creatures nearby, rendering them friendly and able to communicate with the caster. In order to actually command the plants to do something, the caster had to persuade or compel them to act (not unlike a ''[[charm person]]'' spell). The plant creatures would not obey highly dangerous or risky commands without added convincing.\n\nA more powerful version of this spell was said to have broader effects. It could be used to ''[[mass charm]]'' plant or [[fungus]] creatures; to ''[[Animate objects|animate]]'' trees, bushes, vines, or other forms of plant life; and to mobilize nearby plants to wrap around creatures and objects (thus imitating the ''[[entangle]]'' spell).<ref group=\"note\">This spell underwent a major revision between [[3rd edition]] and [[3.5 edition]] in which the scope of its effects were greatly reduced and its level was dropped from 8 to 4. It may have been either confused for or remixed with ''[[control plants]]''.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was favored among the [[blightlord]]s of [[Talona]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
