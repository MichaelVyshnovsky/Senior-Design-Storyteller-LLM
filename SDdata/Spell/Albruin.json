        "Description": "The sword was forged from an alloy of [[steel]], [[electrum]], and [[silver]]. When drawn from its [[scabbard]], the blade emitted an eerie blue glow 10' (3 m) out from the wielder.\n\nThe sword had a mischievous personality and had little interest in fame or glory, preferring to be wielded by those who traveled the span of [[Toril]]. Its personality would come out more when it found itself within interesting locales such as ancient ruins or seldom-explored caverns.",
        "Powers": "Due to the silver within the blade, Albruin was particularly damaging to [[undead]], [[lycanthrope]]s, and other creatures vulnerable to that substance.\n\nIt was an intelligent blade that communicated via speech and telepathy. In addition to fluency in a number of languages, it could read both mundane and magical writings.\n\nThe wielder of Albruin was able to, at will, concentrate the blade's power and continuously [[See invisibility|detect invisible objects]] 10' (3 m) out. They could also cast ''[[neutralize poison]]'' once per day, ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' three times per day and ''[[read magic]]'' at will. If Albruin's bearer was unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated, it could decide to use these powers so long as it was still in contact with them.",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} century DR": "Albruin was wielded for some years by a massive, brave man named [[Basalin]], who was rumored to be a [[werebear]]. He protected his village from [[giant spider]]s for many years and, thanks to the sword's enchantment, their invisible [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] controllers.\n\nSometime before the year [[1368 DR]], Albruin came into the possession of [[Simmeon]], a former adventuring companion of [[Kryll]]. Around a [[1369 DR|year later]], it was being carried a [[wizard]] named [[Raevilin Strathi]], who had gone temporarily mad while ''[[Imprisonment|imprisoned]]'' in the [[Underdark]] below [[Amn]]."
