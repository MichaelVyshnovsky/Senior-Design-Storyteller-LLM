'''''Summon earth grue''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Urdlen]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned an [[earth grue]]. The spell achieved this by opening a ''[[gate]]'' directly to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]]. The grue did not harm the caster and assisted them in whatever was required, from tunneling earth to attacking a foe. It remained on the [[Prime Material Plane]] until it was killed, the spell expired or dispelled by spells such as ''[[dispel magic]]''.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Urdlen and raw metal with a value of at least 50 [[gp]]. The metal was given to the grue as a bribe of sorts during casting.
