Summon earth grue was a spell used by clerics of Urdlen.
When cast, this spell summoned an earth grue. The spell achieved this by opening a gate directly to the Elemental Plane of Earth. The grue did not harm the caster and assisted them in whatever was required, from tunneling earth to attacking a foe. It remained on the Prime Material Plane until it was killed, the spell expired or dispelled by spells such as dispel magic.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Urdlen and raw metal with a value of at least 50 gp. The metal was given to the grue as a bribe of sorts during casting.
