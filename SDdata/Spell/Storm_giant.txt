'''Storm giants''', known as '''''uvarjotunen''''' in their own language, were one of the most intelligent and respected races of [[giant]]s.

{{Quote
|[[Human]]s lack true awareness and most wouldn't know an omen if it walked up and kissed them on the lips. A storm giant attunes itself to the world and glimpses the future in all things, perceiving moments yet to be.

==Description==
Storm giants were the tallest of the [[true giant]]s to remain on the [[Material Plane]], standing a full {{SI|26|ft|long=yes}} in height and massing out at around {{SI|15000|lb|k|long=yes}}.{{Giant vitals/Storm giant}}

There were two ethnicities of storm giants; most had pale, light green skin and dark green hair and eyes, but a small number had violet skin, dark blue hair, and silver eyes.

They tended to wear fine [[tunic]]s and belted [[sandal]]s. When it came to armor, they often favored the use of [[scale mail]].

==Biology==
Storm giants had vision that was well adapted to underwater conditions, where they saw equally as well as they did in the air. Likewise, their lungs were adapted to surviving in underwater conditions.

==Abilities==
Storm giants were known to innately have a high affinity for [[runecaster|runecasting]] as well as traditional [[sorcery]] that surpassed the capabilities of other giant races.{{cite book/Giantcraft|59, 70}} They were generally known to be capable of casting the [[spell]]s ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[control winds]]'', ''[[levitate]]'' &mdash; though unlike the standard spell, they were capable of lifting weights equivalent to their own &mdash; ''[[predict weather]]'', ''[[weather summoning]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[light]]'', and ''[[water breathing]]''.

Their bodies were impervious to harm from lightning and thunder, even that discharged by a [[blue dragon]]. They were even capable of generating and throwing bolts of lightning themselves,

Some storm giants held the ability to mark and claim a mortal humanoid as a [[sea spawn]], either by [[curse|cursing]] them or making a pact with them.

==Combat==
Because of their high affinity for spellcasting, storm giants were the least likely of giants to throw boulders at their opponents when engaging in ranged combat. Whenever one did resort to throwing boulders, a storm giant's tremendous strength allowed them to be hurled as far as {{SIrange|60|240|ft|long=yes}}. When it came to close quarters combat, they typically favored [[greatsword]]s as their weapon of choice.

==Sub-Races==
;[[Maur]]s: A band of storm giant who were cast out thousands of years ago and over time degenerated while imprisoned in the [[Underdark]]. Their bodies were pale and so malformed that they couldn't even stand up straight. They struggled to retain their storm giant culture while scratching out a meager existence underground.

==History==
The storm giant race began with an individual by the name of [[Vilmos]], one of the mortal children of [[Annam All-Father]] and [[Othea]], who in the kingdom of [[Ostoria]] was ceded control of the lakes and seas.{{cite book/Giantcraft|7}} They and the [[titan]]s created some of the greatest cities within this kingdom, featuring mechanical conveyances and galleries that would house artistic tributes to all giantkind.<ref>

==Society==
The head of a storm giant tribe's [[Ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']] was called a "[[paramount]]".
In storm giant society, any act of mercy or charity towards a sentient being was seen as good.
===Homelands===
Storm giants generally lived inside of castles, either located atop mountains, in the clouds, or underneath the ocean Those that could not sustain themselves on hunting alone often built large gardens, fields, or vineyards near their homes.

===Languages===
Storm giants spoke the general giant language [[Jotun]], their own specialized version of it known as ''[[Jotunuvar]]'', as well as [[Common]]. They were often illiterate, though to a lesser degree than giant races whose cultures put little value on education, such as [[hill giant|hill]] and [[fire giant]]s.
====Names====
Common given names among storm giants included the following:<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-25 - Common Giant Names
}}

;Males: Gautarr, Harrdiir, Ilknarr, Kuruth, Ogmoth, Ogmund, Ormmur, Torune, and Ulvulk.
;Females: Geironal, Helgyra, Hornarra, Mistfast, Relsif, Silkarra, Sparraxe, Talnut, Wynd, and Yimmra.

===Relationships===
Storm giants that dwelled on land were usually seen as being on good terms with nearby [[copper dragon]]s and good-aligned [[cloud giant]]s, often working with them to ensure a mutual defense.

They were often known to keep pets and guard animals. Those that lived in high elevations, meaning clouds or mountains, typically kept animals such as [[roc]]s and [[griffon]]s. Those that lived underwater would often keep [[sea lion]]s.
