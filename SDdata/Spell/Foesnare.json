        "mainbody": "'''''Foesnare''''' is a basic [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] used by some [[swordmage]]s early in their training. When ''foesnare'' is cast it causes bolts of solid, [[magic|eldritch]] energy to burst from the body of a creature struck with the swordmage's weapon. These bolts, grasping to the body of their victim, tie into the ground beneath, holding the creature still for a brief moment, in addition to wounding the victim with power proportionate to the swordmage's mental processing power. ''Foesnare'', while easy to learn, is straining on its caster and a swordmage must rest at least a few minutes before casting the spell again.",
