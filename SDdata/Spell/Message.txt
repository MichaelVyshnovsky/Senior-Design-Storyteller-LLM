Message was a transmutation spell that let one converse in whispers at a distance. The spell was language-dependent.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material required was a short piece of wire.
According to the tome known as the Book of the Silver Talon, the ingredients for the ink used to inscribe message into spellbooks were one ounce of giant squid sepia, a non-human ear, a non-human tongue from a different body than the ear, an angelica plant, a turnip, three shoots of foxtail grass, six leaves of hedge mustard and a drop of dew. 
The single drop of dew was gathered from a fern leaf during a full moon and placed dropped in a cauldron of boiling water. The tongue, angelica plant, mustard, foxtail, turnip and ear were shredded and added to the mixture as it heated, in their respective order until it boiled over. The sepia was warmed over a flame, to which was added the residue of the boiling concoction. It was kept on the flame for another hour and stirred constantly. After the hour it was cooled and left in a vial for a full day.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Xanad in  and was originally called Xanads message.
