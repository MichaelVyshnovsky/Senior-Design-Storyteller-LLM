        "mainbody": "Skill empowerment was a transmutation spell that magically increased a creatures existing competence in a given skill.\nBy touching a willing creature, the spell increased that creatures understanding and domain over a skill with which the creature had had previous training, but was not an expert. For up to 1 hour, as long as the caster kept concentrating, the target enjoyed unmatched expertise on that particular skill.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
