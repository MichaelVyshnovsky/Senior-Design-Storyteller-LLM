        "mainbody": "'''''Continual light''''' was an [[alteration]] spell used by both [[arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcasters to create a permanent area of sun-bright illumination.[[Illusionists]] had their own ''[[continual darkness]]'' spell. created the absence of light.",
        "Effects": "This spell filled the area of effect with light equivalent to full daylight which lasted until negated magically, such as with ''[[dispel magic]]''. It could be cast at a point in the air, onto an object, or possibly onto a creature. If successfully cast on the visual organs of a creature, it was effectively blinded.\n\nThe intensity of light from this spell was sufficient to harm creatures that were harmed by bright light or direct sunlight.\n\nThe divine versions of this spell had twice the range of their arcane counterparts. They were also reversible as ''continual darkness'', and produced areas of permanent ''[[darkness]]''. This spell countered ''darkness'' spells of equal or lesser power, and vice versa.\n\n[[Sinhala]] stones were also known to prevent magical darkness. [[Hambergyle]] gems could be used to turn a ''[[light]]'' spell into ''continual light''.\n\nThis spell eventually consumed the material it was cast upon, but dense, hard, or expensive materials (like [[gem]]s) could last hundreds to thousands of years.",
        "Components": "This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast. The material component was the substance it was cast upon: air, an object, a structure, or a creature.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Polybeus]] in {{Yearlink|-1164}} and was originally called ''Polybeus's illumination''."
