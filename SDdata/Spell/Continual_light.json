It could be cast at a point in the air, onto an object, or possibly onto a creature. If successfully cast on the visual organs of a creature, it was effectively blinded.\nThe intensity of light from this spell was sufficient to harm creatures that were harmed by bright light or direct sunlight.\nThe divine versions of this spell had twice the range of their arcane counterparts. They were also reversible as continual darkness, and produced areas of permanent darkness. This spell countered darkness spells of equal or lesser power, and vice versa.\nSinhala stones were also known to prevent magical darkness. Hambergyle gems could be used to turn a light spell into continual light.\nThis spell eventually consumed the material it was cast upon, but dense, hard, or expensive materials (like gems) could last hundreds to thousands of years.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast. The material component was the substance it was cast upon air, an object, a structure, or a creature.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Polybeus in  and was originally called Polybeuss illumination."
