This spell was created by the Simbul and was rarely used by others.\nThis spell allowed the casters next two spells to be cast requiring only an immediate silent act of will. Spell components were not required regardless of the spells chosen. Both of the selected spells were cast with maximum efficiency with regards to the harm they caused and their duration.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
