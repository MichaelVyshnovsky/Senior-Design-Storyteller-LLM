        "mainbody": "'''Wu jen''' ({{Pronounce|woo|jen|refs=}}), also called '''wu-jen''', In [[T'u Lung]], they were called '''Fang-hsiang Shih''', which translated to \"master of recipes\".",
        "Culture": "They used the spirit forces, elements, and the powers of nature. Usually living in the wilderness as hermits and anchorites, they purified their minds and bodies in order to make contact with assorted natural and supernatural powers in the world around them.",
        "Benefits": "Wu jen spoke the languages of [[Tengu]] and [[Oni]]. Their dealings with these creatures granted the wu jen favor in most circumstances.\n\nOne of the benefits that wu jen had was the ability to use [[ki]] to cast lesser [[spell]]s at full potency. In addition, when they learned all the spells of one element that they were able to, their spells of that element became harder to dodge and easier to hit with.\n\nUnlike other wizards they could use any weapon, but still could not use [[armor]] or [[shield]]s. While most wu jen had the five elements (Earth, Fire, Metal, Water, and Wood), some replaced Metal with Nature instead. Though they might remember less spells, they did not need to prepare them, instead simply remembering their scriptures and casting these spells at will.\n\nThey could also enter a yogic trance that is similar to an [[elf]] trance, giving them the benefits of a sleep without the penalty to their awareness. They could also increase their physical power for a short duration at the cost of their health.\n\nThey could also act faster than most others, and increase their potency with one of the elements, but did require a [[spellbook]]. They could also gain more knowledge and could recognize spells of their elements easier.",
        "Hindrances": "Wu jen had taboos that became more plentiful as they increased in power. These included not eating meat; not making daily offerings to the [[spirit]]s; not being able to bathe, cut their hair, or touch a dead body; not sit facing a certain direction, and more.\n\nWhile some wu jen could combine their schools, but focused on one, some others could cast from only their own school. However, they also took damage when casting stronger spells, and only received half of all magical healing.",
        "Notable Wu Jen": "[[File:Crow Dz Pong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Commanding elemental [[water]], the wu jen pirate Crow Dz Pong runs across the waves.'']]\n* [[Crow Dz Pong]]\n* [[Udi]]\n* [[Ken-Yo]]\n* [[May T'ang Lien]]"
