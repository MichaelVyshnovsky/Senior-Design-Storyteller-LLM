Sand seal was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
With this spell a wizard was able to create a solid barrier of sand capable of barring a doorway.
Wizards with more power were able to create sand seals that were more resilient to attack. The sand seal had a small chance to utterly shatter a weapon striking it.
This spell required a handful of sand and a small lump of wax as material components in order to cast.
