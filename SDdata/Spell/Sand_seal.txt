}}'''''Sand seal''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
With this spell a [[wizard]] was able to create a solid barrier of [[sand]] capable of barring a doorway.

Wizards with more power were able to create sand seals that were more resilient to attack. The sand seal had a small chance to utterly shatter a weapon striking it.

==Components==
This spell required a handful of sand and a small lump of wax as [[material component]]s in order to cast.
