Wolfsong was a bardic spell that lured all wolves in the area to the caster. It was created by Harkon Lukas, the Darklord of Kartakass.
Wolfsong was effectively a song infused with bardic magic. The spellcaster performed a sinister, ululating song that could be heard all across an area of up to  around the bard. The wailing melody was carried through magic, enthralling all wolves and dire wolves who heard it and could not resist its compulsion. The wolves affected by this song howled back at the caster and immediately moved toward the bard, arriving within one to four minutes. The magical compulsion ended once the wolves reached the source of the wolfsong or faced an impregnable obstacle in their way. The spell had no limit to how many wolves and dire wolves it could affect. The wolfsong spell could also penetrate the sinister mists of the Domains of Dread. One important distinction between this spell and a summoning was the fact that the beckoned wolves were not under the casters control.
Wolfsong required verbal and somatic components to be cast. The radius a wolfsong traveled increased by a single mile per circle of magic used for the casting.
Wolfsong was invented by Harkon Lukas, the wolfwere Darklord of Kartakass, who hailed from Cormyr. He often taught the spell to the bards he found troublesome, never revealing to them that the summoned wolves were not actually under the casters control.
