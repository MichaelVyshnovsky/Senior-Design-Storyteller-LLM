        "mainbody": "Eldritch blast was the most basic of all spells known to a warlock.Before the Spellplague, this spell was a spell-like ability for most warlocks.\nWhen a warlock cast an eldritch blast he created and fired from his hands or implement a purple bolt or beam of crackling destructive energy. Like similarly simple spells, eldritch blast could be cast as many times as its caster desired.\nThe range of the spell depended on what era it was used in, before the Spellplague the spell could reach 60 feet, afterward only 50 feet, while after the Second Sundering it could go as far as 120 feet.\nThe spells damaging power growth also changed with eras, while before the spellplague the warlocks skill in the arts of the warlock determined the powers of the blast, after it became more powerful if the caster had a strong personality. A post Second Sundering casting would cast more beams that could have been aimed at the same or multiple targets.\nSome of the greatest uses for the spell or ability of eldritch blast is that in some eras it can be modified or exchanged with different warlock abilities like the eldritch spear.\nIn some eras, the spell seemed to have no requirements other than skill, while in others it also needed both verbal and somatic components."
