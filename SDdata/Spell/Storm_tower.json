        "mainbody": "'''''Storm tower''''' was a powerful [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell formed a dark tower of swirling storm clouds that negated many forms of magic. The high speed of the swirling winds of the tower prevented any sort of ranged attack to pass through. Man-sized creatures were simply not strong enough to pass through the barrier of the ''storm tower'', though giant-sized creatures could.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
