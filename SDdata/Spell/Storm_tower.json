        "mainbody": "Storm tower was a powerful abjuration spell used by druids.\nThis spell formed a dark tower of swirling storm clouds that negated many forms of magic. The high speed of the swirling winds of the tower prevented any sort of ranged attack to pass through. Man-sized creatures were simply not strong enough to pass through the barrier of the storm tower, though giant-sized creatures could.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
