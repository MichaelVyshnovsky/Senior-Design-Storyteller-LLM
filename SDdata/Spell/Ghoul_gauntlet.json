        "mainbody": "'''''Ghoul gauntlet''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[necromancy]] and [[alteration]] that slowly transformed a vicitm into a [[ghoul]].",
        "Powers": "The magic of the spell spread outward from where the victim were touched by the caster, typically on the hand or arm. The touch caused physical pain as the magic spread, seeking the victim's brain and heart and killing them. The terrible curse could be avoided if the touched limb was amputated quickly. The victim would awaken as a ghoul one day after their passing.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pinch of purple [[mandrake]] root and a fingernail from a corpse to cast. Both components were consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]]."
