        "mainbody": "Foulwings were huge, monstrous aberrations.\nThey were very large with black, leathery wings, toad-like bodies, and horse-like heads. Their skin was black and covered in \"horn-shaped, wriggling skin growths.\" They were clumsy fliers. Their most distinctive feature was their three jaws filled with razor-sharp teeth and centered around a single snout. Their eyes glowed red in infravision.\nFoulwings were generally considered to be lazy creatures.\nFoulwings communicated with each other through animal-like grunts and calls.\nFoulwings preferred to use their weight to pin prey or enemies under their bodies. They had the ability to breathe out ammonia, causing irritation to the eyes and nose of their targets. They used their sharp teeth to pierce the flesh of a target and suck its blood.\nThese creatures often lived solitarily, but occasionally they could be found in flocks of up to four creatures. \nFoulwings were a carnivorous species. They were known to hunt live prey and sometimes kept creatures captive for food, but their preferred food was carrion.\nFoulwings were believed to have originated on a different plane, but it was not known which plane. They could be found in any environment,\nthumb|273px|A foulwing is used as a mount.\nFoulwings were sometimes used as mounts by evil humanoids, such as drow.\nFoulwings sometimes mated with wyverns, creating a type of hybrid creature known as a foulvern.\nFoulwing flesh was unappetizing as meat, but their saliva and blood made a good caustic cleaner for metal items.\n* Zvopua, \"fouldrake\" (half-black dragon advanced foulwing) mount to Eregul."
