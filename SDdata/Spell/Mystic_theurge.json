        "mainbody": "'''Mystic theurges''' were advanced practitioners of both [[Divine magic|divine]] and [[arcane magic]]s.",
        "Culture": "The majority of spellcasters pursued only one source of [[magic]], whether arcane or divine, but mystic theurges studied them both at once and blurred the lines between them. They drew their magical power from both faith in the [[god]]s and from [[spellbook]]s of arcane lore. Hence, mystic theurges were deeply interested in magic in all its forms. \n\nMystic theurges were rare but not unknown within [[Waterdeep]]. They were common among [[human]]s of [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]] ancestry. [[Scro]] war priests were mystic theurges.{{Cite dragon/339/Races of Spelljammer|30-31}} \n[[Sharn]]s often were mystic theurges.",
        "Activities": "Mystic theurges were constantly seeking out potent [[magic item]]s and new arcane spells to add to their spellbooks. They typically journeyed to the far corners of the world in search of new magic, arcane secrets, or divine insights. They would also act in the name of their [[deity]] if they were also priests.",
        "Prerequisites": "To follow this dual path, one needed to be equally versed in arcane and religious lore and to have mastered at least the low-level spells of both arcane and divine magics. They were typically [[cleric]]/[[wizard]]s or cleric/[[sorcerer]]s, while [[druid]]/sorcerers were rare and druid/wizards were nigh impossible to find.",
        "Abilities": "Although lacking the uninterrupted progression in [[spell]]s of a dedicated spellcaster, mystic theurges enjoyed an unmatched variety of spells to learn and choose from and the versatility of using all of them together. For example, a cleric/wizard mystic theurge could theoretically learn all arcane spells they could as a wizard and pray for all divine spells they could as a cleric. However, they would learn no new powers and progress no existing powers outside their spellcasting.\n\nThey had a narrow range of skills, in spellcraft, arcane and religious lore, concentration, and sensing deception.",
        "Notable Mystic Theurges": "* [[Corinna Lathankin]], a member of the [[Order of the Aster]]{{Cite dungeon/126/Vampires of Waterdeep: Blood of Malar|75,76}}\n* [[Morasha]] of the [[Lonely Moor]], great-grandniece of [[Aumvor|Aumvor the Undying]]\n* [[Di'Nastassa]], a [[yuan-ti pureblood]] chosen one of a [[jahi]], who led a cabal of Sauringans in the depths of the jungles of [[Samarach]]\n* [[Liren Talis]], wizard and cleric of [[Azuth]] and high priest of the [[Temple of Azuth (Mulmaster)|Temple of Azuth]] in  [[Mulmaster]].<ref>"
