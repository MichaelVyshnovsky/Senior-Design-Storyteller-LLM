        "mainbody": "Mystic theurges were advanced practitioners of both divine and arcane magics.\nThe majority of spellcasters pursued only one source of magic, whether arcane or divine, but mystic theurges studied them both at once and blurred the lines between them. They drew their magical power from both faith in the gods and from spellbooks of arcane lore. Hence, mystic theurges were deeply interested in magic in all its forms. \nMystic theurges were rare but not unknown within Waterdeep. They were common among humans of Halruaan ancestry. Scro war priests were mystic theurges. \nSharns often were mystic theurges. \nMystic theurges were constantly seeking out potent magic items and new arcane spells to add to their spellbooks. They typically journeyed to the far corners of the world in search of new magic, arcane secrets, or divine insights. They would also act in the name of their deity if they were also priests.\nTo follow this dual path, one needed to be equally versed in arcane and religious lore and to have mastered at least the low-level spells of both arcane and divine magics. They were typically cleric/wizards or cleric/sorcerers, while druid/sorcerers were rare and druid/wizards were nigh impossible to find.\nAlthough lacking the uninterrupted progression in spells of a dedicated spellcaster, mystic theurges enjoyed an unmatched variety of spells to learn and choose from and the versatility of using all of them together. For example, a cleric/wizard mystic theurge could theoretically learn all arcane spells they could as a wizard and pray for all divine spells they could as a cleric. However, they would learn no new powers and progress no existing powers outside their spellcasting.\nThey had a narrow range of skills, in spellcraft, arcane and religious lore, concentration, and sensing deception.\n* Corinna Lathankin, a member of the Order of the Aster\n* Morasha of the Lonely Moor, great-grandniece of Aumvor the Undying\n* DiNastassa, a yuan-ti pureblood chosen one of a jahi, who led a cabal of Sauringans in the depths of the jungles of Samarach\n* Liren Talis, wizard and cleric of Azuth and high priest of the Temple of Azuth in  Mulmaster."
