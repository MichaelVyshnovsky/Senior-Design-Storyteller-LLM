'''''Great revenance''''' was a [[spell]] researched by [[Irae T'sarran]] that could raise an army of [[revenant]]s slaved to the caster's will.

==Effects==
The magic of this spell could potentially animate thousands of creatures as [[revenant]]s under the command of the caster. The [[undead]] horde would retain the capabilities each creature had in life but also bring them under a shared will. However, this unifying power could only be achieved if used in conjunction with a potent source of [[negative energy]], such as that projected by the [[Undying Temple]] in [[Maerimydra]].

==Components==
For the ''great revenance'' spell to perform as it was originally intended, it required the empowering negative energy of the [[Undying Temple]] and a great number of recently deceased bodies.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], on [[Marpenoth 2]], Irae T'sarran began researching the ''great revenance'' spell under [[Kiaransalee]]'s guidance in [[Maerimydra]]. Irae summoned the [[Undying Temple]] to [[Castle Maerimydra]] on [[Marpenoth 17]] and moved her spell research there. By [[Marpenoth 27]], she was devoting most of her time to developing the spell and had made plans to use the spell on the [[Dalelands]] above.
