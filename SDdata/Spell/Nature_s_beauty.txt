'''''Nature's beauty''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell altered the caster's appearance to become the very idea of beauty. The illusion lasted only for a few seconds. Every creature within {{SI|5|ft}} of the caster were struck with temporary blindness. There was also a chance an affected creature would yearn for the illusion after the spell expired, leading to their death.
