Move earth was a transmutation spell that excavated trenches and created hills.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components, in the form of a mix of different soils like clay, loam, and sand in a small bag, as well as an iron blade.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Proctiv in  and was originally called Proctivs earthmove.
