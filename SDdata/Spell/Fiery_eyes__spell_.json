        "mainbody": "Fiery eyes was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell illuminated a wu jens eyes. This allowed the caster to provide light up to a range of 3 feet (1 meter). By staring at a combustible material or object, the wu jen was able to create a small fire. The wu jen was able to control the color of the light.\nAny creature who looked at the wu jen during this spell was susceptible to distraction, and it was often used alongside hypnosis, hypnotic pattern, or mass suggestion spells.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components."
