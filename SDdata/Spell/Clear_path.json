        "mainbody": "Clear path was an alteration spell that cleared a corridor in front of the caster as he or she traveled through rough terrain. The reverse of this spell, called clutter path, obfuscated the terrain behind the caster, covering any tracks.\nThis spell operated in natural environments that were considered rough terrain, such as jungles, forests, rocky terrain, or snow. It was not able to clear natural hazards such as lava or quicksand and had no effect on bodies of water. Structures and handmade barriers or magically created terrain were also immune to this spell. As the caster moved forward, a path 10 ft (3 m) wide was cleared of weeds, vines, stones, underbrush, snow and ice, or other such impediments to travel for 10 ft (3 m) in front of the caster. This created a continuous path as long as the caster continued moving forward. Clear path lasted for a number of hours and more experienced casters could extend it for more hours. Note that tracking the passage of the caster was childs play as the created path was quite obvious.\nWhen cast in reverse, clutter path obscured the 10 ft by 10 ft (3 m by 3 m) area behind the caster as he or she traveled forward. Debris appropriate to the terrain was scattered about, covering the trail and making tracking much more difficult.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, clear path required a knife blade and a piece of straw from a broom clutter path required a handful of weeds and a handfull of pebbles.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
