'''''Stealweb''''' was an [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[wizard]] [[spell]]. This spell was derived from an ancient [[Netheril|Netherese]] spell long since forgotten.

==Effects==
This spell was used on portals such as door frames, archways or windows. It could also be used on crude openings such as the space between two large rocks. When cast on such portals the spell lay waiting until triggered, giving off a faint hint of [[magic]]. The caster of this spell could not be harmed by its magic. The caster determined specific trigger conditions that would release the spell's energy during the time of casting.

When triggered, ''stealweb'' released a bright web of white lines that washed over the victim and then vanished. Only a single victim could be targeted by the spell per instance, but the spell could be triggered more depending on the skill of the caster.

The victim suffered initial harm from the web of lines that touched them but could only be harmed once in this manner from the spell. Furthermore, if after being harmed in this way, the victim crossed through the portal while the same ''stealweb'' was active, they would not suffer additional harm from the magical energy.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of [[phosphorous]], a flint and a piece of cobweb to cast.
