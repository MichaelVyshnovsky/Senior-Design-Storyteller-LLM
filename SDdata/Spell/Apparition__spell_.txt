'''''Apparition''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] that caused a subject's face to become terrifying. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
The spell transformed the target's face into a horrifying mask. The caster was not able to duplicate the appearance of any existing creature, and thus created the horrible mask using portions of different creatures. When viewed by others, the mask had a startling effect. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a small painter's palette with paints of various colors.
