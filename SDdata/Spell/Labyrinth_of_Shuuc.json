        "mainbody": "he Labyrinth of Shuuc was an extradimensional maze built by wizard named Shuuc to stash his magical treasures in.\nThe location of the Labyrinth was unknown however, its main entrance was the enchanted carpet with a woven image of a spiral staircase that descended into the depths of its silken oriental designs. The carpet was much heavier than it seemed and it was  long,  wide. The patterns on the carpet appeared to shift and change in the light, despite its age and ruggedness. When unrolled, the carpet revealed the stairwell, and individuals could simply walk the stairs down into the extradimensional space. The gateway in the carpet only opened when it was unrolled in specific circumstances mandated by the Labyrinths creator â€“ Shuuc. The magic carpet could not be used as a portable hole as it only opened the entrance into the maze in only a certain spot.\nHowever, another entry existed. On Toril, one could find an enchanted Labyrinth Map of Shuuc, presumably used by the mazes creator. The owner of the man could use it to transport themselves into Shuucs maze, away from danger, later reemerging from it once the danger passed.\nthumb|The 370x370px\nWhen visitors descended down the spiraling staircase, they reach a stone wall at the base of the climb. The wall was a powerful illusion, and visitors could walk through it. The entrance was located roughly at the center of the maze, and two treasure rooms were located in the southern and northern parts of the dungeon, behind illusory walls.\nEach treasure room held a huge stone sarcophagus with several treasure chests inside. The sarcophagi lids were carved of massive slabs of ponderous stone.\nThe veering hallways of the dungeon had massive stone cubes that could be moved by exceptionally strong individuals. These blocks were used to seal off certain paths of the Labyrinth. These blocks were mechanisms affixed to the dungeons wall and could only be pushed, never pulled. To make the maze even more confusing, the movable blocks were virtually indistinguishable from the dungeons walls without magical aid.\nThe only creatures that inhabited the Labyrinth of Shuuc were minotaurs who were locked in the extradimensional dungeon for decades with no food, leaving them ravenous, but alive as the creatures could survive for unnaturally long periods of time with no nourishment. The Minotaurs used the movable stone blocks to trap and slay invaders of their home. The beasts had keen senses, and they were momentarily aware of an intrusion.\nthumb|The Labyrinth Map of Shuuc, portable magic 270x270px\nMuch of the Labyrinth was unknown. At one point, the treasure rooms of the extradimensional maze contained treasures of gold, ivory statues, potion of speed, a staff of command, pearls, quartz, red spinels, and an Apparatus of Kwalish. The lone wizard Shuuc created the carpet using a ki-rins beard hair and phase spider silk, as well as chimera fleece. The minotaurs in his lair were mesmerized into servitude as he preferred the company of monsters.\nThere were several adventurers who claimed the carpet and found a way into the Labyrinth of Shuuc never to be seen after."
