'''''Freeze''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden. It could attack a creature with biting cold and possibly encase the target in ice.

==Effects==
This spell could be cast at a single target, in sight, up to 170 ft (52 m) away (more experienced casters could extend this range). When cast, a white beam of light shot from the caster's outstretched hand and, if the attack on the target succeeded, caused the victim to suffer damage from intense cold. A creature struck by ''freeze'' had one chance to avoid the second, more devastating effect of this spell&mdash;being encased in a sheath of solid ice 5 inches (13 centimeters) thick that continuously subjected the individual to the same cold damage as the white ray.

While a victim was frozen in ice, he or she was awake, aware, and could breathe normally, but could not move or speak except to try and break free using brute strength. Flying creatures immediately fell from the sky, swimming creatures bobbed like a small iceberg. They could perform mental actions that did not require speech or movement, such as a spell-like ability, but casting a spell with no verbal or somatic components still required any material components, [[holy symbol]]s, or spellcasting foci to already be in their hand at the time of freezing.

Ironically, while the frozen creature continuously took cold damage from the ice, they were protected from physical damage by the same ice. Any blows had to first destroy the ice (thus freeing the victim) before damaging the creature. Once the ice was sufficiently cracked, it was slightly easier to break free using strength from within. The ice remained in place until destroyed or until the duration of the spell ran out, whichever came first. The ice immediately melted after the spell expired.

==Components==
This spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]].

==History==
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called ''[[Revelations of the Icedawn]]'' and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.{{Cite dragon/312/Faiths of Faerun: Prayers of the Frostmaiden|62}}
