        "mainbody": "Protection from good was an abjuration spell that created an aura around the target that shielded against mental and physical attacks by good creatures. The reverse of this spell, protection from evil, had identical effects on evil creatures.\nThis spell functioned exactly like protection from evil except the bonuses and benefits applied to attacks from good creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the caster had to draw a 3 ft (91 cm) circle around the recipient using powdered silver for the newest version of the spell. See the description of the components for the reversible version of this spell at protection from evil.\nThe arcane version of the protection from good spell was an invention of Netherese arcanist Mdhal from the year 2745 NY (âˆ’1114 DR). The original name of the non-reversed form was Mdahls dispel evil."
