        "mainbody": "Snake skin was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Sseth.\nThis spell allowed the caster to shapechange into any kind of snake or serpent, acquiring all of the traits and abilities of their new form. The spell lasted for several hours, during which the caster could change forms between different kinds of snakes at will. The spell would end immediately if the caster reverted back to their original form.\nPhysical harm experienced by the caster would be partially healed both when changing into their first snake form, as well as when the caster reverted to their original form. Clothing and items carried by the caster also became part of the snake form for the spells duration, reverting back to normal when the spell ended. The caster would shed their final snake skin when the spell ended. This shed skin could then be used as a possible spell component.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small piece of dry skin shed by a serpent to cast."
