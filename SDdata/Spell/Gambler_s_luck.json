        "mainbody": "Gamblers luck was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA wu jen cast this spell when they gambled or took part in a game of chance. The wu jen had no way to control the spell, or the spells outcome on the game. There was a 40% chance the outcome would not work in the wu jens favor, and a 60% chance it would. While a negative outcome would not affect the game itself, the wu jen would be over-taken by an obsessive need to gamble, taking reckless wagers and betting far too much. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small statue of Hsing Yong, the god of luck."
