It collected small objects of a single type into one place.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and the area of effect was . When cast, all objects of the named type in the area of effect were pulled into a neat pile. If the items were stackable, like coins, the caster could choose to form small stacks. This cantrip was useful for cleaning up scattered objects or separating types of items that were mixed together. For example, gather could be used to collect papers on a desk, or separate salt from sugar, nails from screws, and silver coins from platinum coins. Only the named item was neatly collected.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. Starting with open arms, the caster pulled their arms in as if to gather things together while speaking the type of object to be collected."
