        "Effects": "The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and the area of effect was {{SI|1|sq yd|long=yes}}. When cast, all objects of the named type in the area of effect were pulled into a neat pile. If the items were stackable, like coins, the caster could choose to form small stacks. This cantrip was useful for cleaning up scattered objects or separating types of items that were mixed together. For example, ''gather'' could be used to collect [[paper]]s on a desk, or separate [[salt]] from [[sugar]], [[nail]]s from [[screw]]s, and [[silver piece|silver coins]] from [[platinum piece|platinum coins]]. Only the named item was neatly collected.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. Starting with open arms, the caster pulled their arms in as if to gather things together while speaking the type of object to be collected."
