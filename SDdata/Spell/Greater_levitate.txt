Greater levitate was a transmutation spell that functioned exactly as the spell levitate but allowed the caster to raised items of much larger mass. This spell could elevate an object that weighed up to 9000 lbs (4082 kg) or more, depending on the skill and experience of the caster.
The ancient artifact known as the Crown of the Mountain allowed its wearer to cast this spell whenever they wished.
