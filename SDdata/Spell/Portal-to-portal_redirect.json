        "mainbody": "'''''Portal-to-portal redirect''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that temporarily changed the destination of a ''[[portal]]''.",
        "Effects": "The caster of the ''portal-to-portal redirect'' changed the destination of the targeted ''portal''. There were a number of limitations to it. First, only ''portal''-destinations that the caster actually traveled to via ''portals'' were a possible destination. Second, only the destination was changed, no other property of the targeted ''portal'' could be changed. For example, a one-way-''portal'' could not be changed into a two-way one.",
        "Components": "Casting ''portal-to-portal redirect'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s as well as a [[divine focus]].",
        "History": "By [[1372 DR]], a [[magic]]al [[staff]] called a ''[[staff of portals]]'' had been invented in the [[Underdark]] that could be used to cast the spell. It required the ''portal-to-portal redirect'' spell to craft."
