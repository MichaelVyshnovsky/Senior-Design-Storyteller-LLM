'''''Maze of mirrors''''' is a [[spell]] of the [[illusion|illusion school]] learned by some [[wizard]]s, particularly those interested in illusions as a speciality. When cast, ''maze of mirrors'' appears to create a tiny labyrinth of mirrors over an area {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, somewhere within {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} of the wizard. Any creatures caught within might be fooled by the illusion and left unable to escape until the illusion dissipates a moment later, enough time for a wizard or their allies to take advantage of the situation. The ''maze of mirrors'' spell is complex enough that wizards cannot cast it more than once between rests of a few minutes or more in length.
