'''''Deceive prying''''' was a spell used by priests of [[Vhaeraun]] to pass mental examination.

==Effects==
Upon casting, the caster determined some criteria, such as religious and moral standards; these standards didn't need to match up with the caster's actual mental state. The caster or creature touched by the caster gave away this false information when mentally examined by magical or psionic means. The spell provided surface thoughts depending on the set criteria to be read by the examiner.

The spell also provided minor protection against spells that were directed at mentally controlling the recipient, while not hindering the mental activity of the same, including mental magical activity..

==Components==
This spell required only material, verbal and somatic components to cast.
