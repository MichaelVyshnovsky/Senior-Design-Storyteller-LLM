'''''Shield of the archons''''' was a planar [[spell]] used by [[priest]]s as a means of protection from spells.

==Effects==
When cast, a [[magic]]al shield was created by altruistic energies. The shield
spanned a 120Â° angle, and absorbed incoming spells sent towards the caster. Area-of-effect spells had a lower chance of affecting the shielded creature, and reduced the damage taken, if hit. However, the shield had a chance to break, and that chance was proportional to the power of the spell cast.

The magical shield would dynamically change angular coverage to absorb the most powerful spell, provided several spells were directed at the shielded creature at the same time.

==Components==
The powerful spell only required a [[verbal component]].

==History==
''Shield of the archons'' was created by priests that worked alongside [[celestial archon]]s of the [[Seven Heavens]]. Thus, such a spell was used by [[good]]-aligned priests who associated with these archons, but other than that, was very rare.
