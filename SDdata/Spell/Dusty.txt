'''''Dusty''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a thin layer of grimy dust to cover an area.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could affect a circular area {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} across. When cast, the area was covered in a film of dust and grime as if it had been left unoccupied and undisturbed for a long time.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a quiet humming sound while moving both hands as if shaking or sprinkling dust over something.
