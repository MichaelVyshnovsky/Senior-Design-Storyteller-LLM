Easy march was an evocation spell that allowed a number of creatures to march quickly for days without fatigue.
The number of creatures that could be affected by this spell and the number of days of duration was related to the casters level of experience. Those under the influence of easy march could move at two and a half times their normal movement rate for the whole day and not suffer from fatigue. Then after the usual amount of food and rest they could get up and do it again the next day, and repeat until the spell ended. During the time that easy march was active, those affected were less effective at fighting, perhaps due to their timing being thrown off.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, easy march required a piece of shoe leather to cast.
* Crusaders were capable of casting easy march twice per tenday.
* Wind at back
* Lively step
