'''''Telekinesis''''' was an arcane [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that allowed a caster to telekinetically move, manipulate, or forcefully hurl objects or creatures.

==Effects==
The spell gave the caster the power of telekinesis, allowing them to move an object or creature in a variety of possible ways, as they wished. According to the power of the caster, it worked up to a distance of hundreds of feet, could move an object weighing up to {{SI|375|lbs.|k|long=yes}}, thrust a number of creatures or objects, and last for a brief time so long as the caster concentrated.

The first application exerted a sustained force on an object, rotating it or moving it in any direction at a speed of up to {{SI|3.3|ft|long=yes}} per second. A creature had to resist the spell in order to hold back or hold onto the object. This application allowed a degree of fine manipulation, such as pulling a [[rope]] or level, turning a key, or even untying a simple knot, if such tasks could be performed with one hand.

The second application exerted a short force on a creature. This wasn't directly harmful, but could be used shove a creature, disarm them of a weapon or item, trip them over, or even grapple with them.

Finally, the third application expended all the spell's energy in a single, violent thrust. It hurled another of objects or creatures close to one another through the air in a certain direction or at a certain target. Hurled objects caused damage or injury, while creatures could be hurled into hard surfaces and suffer injury as a result.

==Components==
''Telekinesis'' required the usual verbal and somatic components.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]] in {{Yearlink|-954}} and was originally called '''''Oberon's telekinesis'''''.

===Notable uses===
In the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] used ''telekinesis'' and [[Kyriani Agrivar]] used a ''[[ring of telekinesis]]'' to together slam shut the [[Great Door]] on the trunk of the [[one who waits]], slaying it.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|22-23}} Soon after, during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Luna|a mage]] of the [[Swords of the Lady|Lunatics]] used ''telekinesis'' to drag [[Timoth Eyesbright|Timoth]] and [[Onyx the Invincible|Onyx]] out of an upper window of the [[House of the Moon]].{{Cite comic/Lunatics|19}}

In [[Waterdeep]] later that year, [[Khelben Arunsun]] used ''telekinesis'' to hurl the ancient villains [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] back into the extra-dimensional prison from whence they came.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|22}}
