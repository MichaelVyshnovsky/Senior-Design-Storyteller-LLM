        "mainbody": "Ray of frost was an arcane spell that released a ray of cold energy.\nWhen cast, the spell conjured a frigid blast of cold, freezing white or blue air which then streaked towards its intended target, over a distance of no more than sixty feet, slowing their movements down for a brief moment.\nPrior to the Spellplague, ray of frost could be cast by both wizards and sorcerers and like all other spells, with the exception of invocations, ray of frost could not be cast at-will but had to be prepared. Ray of frost was also considered a cantrip, or a very basic spell known to virtually all wizards, though it lost this status following the Spellplague, becoming a fully-ranked spell. However, after the Second Sundering, it was again classed as a cantrip, though in this era, cantrips did not have to be prepared, and could be cast at-will.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\n* Green Hag of the Lizard Marsh used the ray of frost as the final step in preparation of the hag treat - \"Eye Scream\"m out of newt eyes, blueberries, and fetid swamp water. The recipe was detailed in the Witchs Brew Cookbook."
