        "Effects": "''Spellweb'' covered up to maximum of 70 cubic feet (2 cubic meters) with a sticky web. The web needed two diametrically opposed anchor points, otherwise the web collapsed and disappeared on casting.\n\nThe web glowed with a green light that faded to white over time. At the caster's discretion, the web could be created without giving off light. Another option was to create a web that gave off a pearly light.\n\nThe web was easy to ignite. A candle could burn away the ''spellweb'' in one minute. This was of course dangerous for people stuck in the web. While it was burning, the web gave off smoke. This smoke was harmless except that it limited vision.\n\nWeb and caster maintained a mental link. This link made it possible for the caster to sense when the web was disturbed, damaged, or had simply expired. A sufficiently strong cleric could end the spell prematurely.\n\nWhen someone touched the ''spellweb'', the person was stuck fast at the web. Sufficiently strong and/or big creatures could break through the web but their mobility was still inhibited.\n\nCreatures stuck in the web were easier to hit. However, ranged attacks were not an effective way to attack someone stuck in the web.",
        "Components": "''Spellweb'' required somatic and verbal components. Its material components were a holy symbol and a [[Rock crystal|crystal]] of any size. This crystal did not need to be an expensive one like a [[diamond]] or even an inorganic one like salt, as a piece of sugar was also a viable crystal.",
        "History": "The spell was associated with the [[drow]]. The pearly radiance version of the spell was used to tell others where the web was."
