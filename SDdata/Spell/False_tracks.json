        "mainbody": "False tracks was a common illusion spell used by ninjas to elude pursuers. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed a ninja to hide their tracks on a soft surface such as dirt or dust. The spell made the ninjas footprints appear as normal animal tracks. The ninja choose which animal during casting. The tracks adjusted for the speed of the ninjas movement. The spells illusion extended to the clothing of the ninja, so if a piece of the ninjas clothing was cut off or snagged, it appeared as a piece of animal skin. The illusion did not apply to the ninjas equipment or items. \nThe spell was vulnerable to dispel magic. If a dispel magic spell was cast anywhere on the track, the entire illusion would shatter, thus revealing the ninjas true footprints. When the spell expired, the tracks reverted to normal. \nThe spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures."
