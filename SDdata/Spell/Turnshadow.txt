'''''Turnshadow''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that could cause fear in illusory shadow monsters. It could also be used to take control of one such creature away from its summoner.

==Effects==
This spell was effective against quasi-real illusions created by the ''[[shadow monsters]]'', ''[[demi-shadow monsters]]'', and ''[[shades]]'' spells. When cast on a 40-ft (12-m) square area up to 60 yd (55 m) away, all such creatures fled in panic as quickly as they were able for a number of minutes related to the caster's level. Once the spell wore off, they could return if they were able.

When ''turnshadow'' was directed at a single shadow monster, it had one chance to resist the magic of this spell. If it succeeded, then nothing happened, but if it failed it came under the control of the caster. The caster was then free to pick a new target for its attack, including the mage who originally summoned the monster. Once ''turnshadow'' expired, the controlled shadow monster was banished back to the [[Plane of Shadow]].

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
This spell was developed by wizards who specialized in the abjuration school of magic to counter the creatures summoned by [[illusionist]]s. This spell was later published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community.
