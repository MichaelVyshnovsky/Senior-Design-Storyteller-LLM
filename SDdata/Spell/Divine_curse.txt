Divine curse was a divine abjuration spell that affected a target with a terrible curse.
The immense evil power of a divine curse could only be used against someone who had committed a great act of evil that affected the caster. The caster selected the specifics of the curse, so their wording when casting the spell needed to be precise. A divine curse could only be removed by an atonement spell or if the wording of the spell left some kind of escape clause.
In addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a silver gong to cast.
Myrkyssa Jelan, a warlord in the Vast during the 14 century DR, had her ability to wield magic taken away by a divine curse.
