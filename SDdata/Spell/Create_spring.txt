Create spring was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, this spell summoned a spring of fresh clean potable water to appear in the ground. The spell was only effective if cast on natural terrain. The spell could not be cast directly on creatures or plants, nor on a non-natural construction such as a cobble road. The amount of water that the spring provided was based on the shugenjas skill level. 
Dry spring was the reverse of the spell. It reverse the effect of create spring or dried up a natural spring. This was accomplished by reducing the flow of the spring.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a cane made of bamboo.
