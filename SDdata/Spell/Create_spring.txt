'''''Create spring''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned a spring of fresh clean potable water to appear in the ground. The spell was only effective if cast on natural terrain. The spell could not be cast directly on creatures or plants, nor on a non-natural construction such as a cobble road. The amount of water that the spring provided was based on the shugenja's skill level. 

''[[Dry spring]]'' was the reverse of the spell. It reverse the effect of ''create spring'' or dried up a natural spring. This was accomplished by reducing the flow of the spring.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a cane made of [[bamboo]].
