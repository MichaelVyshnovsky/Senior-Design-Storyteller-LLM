        "mainbody": "'''''Incarnation of evil''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Set]] called [[Nighthunter]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the priest to take the form of a [[jackal]], venomous [[snake]], [[crocodile]], or [[giant scorpion]]. The priest had access to all of the animal's abilities but was also susceptible to all of their weaknesses. The priest could change between the four forms at will instantly, transferring any damage taken to the new form.\n\nThere was a slight cumulative risk that by using this spell the priest would become a permanent divine minion of Set.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]], a jackal's tooth, a jawbone of a snake, a crocodile's tooth, and a scorpion's stinger to cast. The spell could still be cast if any of the animal parts were missing but the caster could not take the form of the missing part."
