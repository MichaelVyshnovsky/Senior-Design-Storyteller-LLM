        "mainbody": "Incarnation of evil was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Set called Nighthunters.\nThis spell allowed the priest to take the form of a jackal, venomous snake, crocodile, or giant scorpion. The priest had access to all of the animals abilities but was also susceptible to all of their weaknesses. The priest could change between the four forms at will instantly, transferring any damage taken to the new form.\nThere was a slight cumulative risk that by using this spell the priest would become a permanent divine minion of Set.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol, a jackals tooth, a jawbone of a snake, a crocodiles tooth, and a scorpions stinger to cast. The spell could still be cast if any of the animal parts were missing but the caster could not take the form of the missing part."
