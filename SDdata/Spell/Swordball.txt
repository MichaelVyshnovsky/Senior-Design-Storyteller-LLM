A '''"swordball"''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] that caused rusty fragments of old weapons to explode outwards in all directions. It worked exactly the same way as a ''[[fireball]]'' exploded with flames.

==History==
When the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] was assaulted by [[Maldrithor]], the "[[Sarbreenar]] Wyrm", the people of the city hired a [[wizard]] to slay the [[dragon]]. The wizard used swordballs to bloodily tear Maldrithor apart, and sent the dragon crashing down dead into the harbor amid a rain of blood and bone.
