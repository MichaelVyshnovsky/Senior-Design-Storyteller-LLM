Protection from winged flyers was an abjuration spell that allowed the caster to protect someone from any creatures that had wings and flew. 
These flying beasts were completely unable to even touch the target of the spell. It worked similarly to the spell protection from evil.
The material component required to cast this spell was a simple feather, or bat wing.
