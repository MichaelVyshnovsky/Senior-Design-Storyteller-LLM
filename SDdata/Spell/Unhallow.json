        "mainbody": "Unhallow was a divine evocation spell for clerics and druids that marked an unholy site.\nFrom the point touched by the caster, the unhallow spell covered an area 40 feet (12.2 meters) in radius, enabling it to encompass a building, structure, or other location. Only one unhallow could be placed on the area, but it was permanent. It countered hallow, but could not dispel it. Unhallow had three distinct effects within that area.\nFirst, the unhallowed area was warded by a magic circle against good.\nSecond, all efforts by a cleric in the unhallowed area to rebuke undead through force of charisma were bolstered by the profane power of the place. In turn, efforts to turn undead in the same manner were hampered. This benefit did not arise for a druid casting unhallow.\nThird, one other spell could be attached to the unhallowed area. It operated over the entire area, regardless of how the spell functioned normally, and lasted a full year before expiring. The caster could specify whether it applied to all creatures in the area, only those who shared their faith or alignment, or only those of a rival faith or alignment. Spells that could be attached included aid, bane, bless, cause fear, darkness, daylight, death ward, deeper darkness, detect good, detect magic, dimensional anchor, discern lies, dispel magic, endure elements, freedom of movement, invisibility purge, protection from energy, remove fear, resist energy, silence, tongues, and zone of truth. This spell could only be changed or renewed by casting unhallow again.\nIt required verbal and somatic components, and material components comprising herbs, incense, and oils. These should be worth at least 1000 gold pieces, with thousands more according to the power of spell included. Unlike hallow, it did not need a divine focus. The spell took a full 24 hours to cast."
