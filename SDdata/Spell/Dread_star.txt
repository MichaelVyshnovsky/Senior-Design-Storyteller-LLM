'''Dread star''' is a [[warlock]] [[invocation]] of some complexity learned early in some warlocks' training. When a warlock casts ''dread star'' he or she [[conjuration|conjures]] a fist-sized sphere of brilliant blue-white light, which then proceeds to whirl around a creature of the warlock's choosing within fifty feet, searing them with painful blasts of light that discourage movement of any kind. The intensity of the beams is largely determined by the warlock's charisma. Even if the orb fails to immobilize and injure its target, its light is so blinding that it reduces the creature's will to resist other, similar attacks. The orb dissipates within a short moment and, due to its complexity, can only be cast once per day.
