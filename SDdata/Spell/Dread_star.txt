Dread star is a warlock invocation of some complexity learned early in some warlocks training. When a warlock casts dread star he or she conjures a fist-sized sphere of brilliant blue-white light, which then proceeds to whirl around a creature of the warlocks choosing within fifty feet, searing them with painful blasts of light that discourage movement of any kind. The intensity of the beams is largely determined by the warlocks charisma. Even if the orb fails to immobilize and injure its target, its light is so blinding that it reduces the creatures will to resist other, similar attacks. The orb dissipates within a short moment and, due to its complexity, can only be cast once per day.
