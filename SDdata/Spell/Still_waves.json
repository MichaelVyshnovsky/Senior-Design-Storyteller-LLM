        "mainbody": "Still waves was a divine invocation spell used by specialty priests devoted to Valkur, enabling them to calm waves at sea.\nThis spell calmed the waves within a  by  area of water, allowing sailors and cargo to be fished out of the sea. Heavy chop waves were reduced to still water and raging waves from storms were reduced to heavy chop. The spell would have to overpower a water elemental if cast in the same area.\nThis spell required only verbal components and somatic components to cast."
