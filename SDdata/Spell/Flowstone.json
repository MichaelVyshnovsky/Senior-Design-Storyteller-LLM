        "mainbody": "Flowstone was a spell used by clerics of Sharindlar.\nWhen cast, this spell caused stone to flow like a thick syrup. It was often used to create passageways. The flowing stone could be manipulated with tools and forms to create doors and tunnels. Stone that has already been worked was not affected by this spell.\nThe spell could also be used as a weapon. A caster could cause stone to flow over their enemies, who became embedded in solid stone.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a drop of water mixed with some mud, a single grain of sand and a pebble."
