        "mainbody": "'''''Banish dazzle''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "Once this spell was cast the target could see clearly through blinding sunlight and heat shimmer. This spell also helped the target resist other spells directed at their eyes such as ''[[color spray]]'', ''[[dazzle]]'' or ''[[fire charm]]''. Reflected [[sunlight]] from a [[mirror]] had no effect on the target, and they were immune from being blinded by light spells.",
        "Components": "This spell required a shard of [[glass]], [[mica]], gemstone, or clear crystal as a [[material component]] to cast. This shard was destroyed upon casting."
