'''''Whirlwind of steel''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] and [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Garagos]] called [[Bloodreaver]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created five phantom arms wielding [[scimitar]]s that would silently attack targets selected by the caster until dispelled, willed away by the caster, or blocked by magical barriers. The caster decided at the time of casting whether the scimitars would remain in a stationary area or attack a target elsewhere. The caster was not immune to the scimitars' attacks so needed to be careful where they wandered. 

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of a metal-bladed weapon to cast.
