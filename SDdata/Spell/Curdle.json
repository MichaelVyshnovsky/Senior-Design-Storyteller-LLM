        "Effects": "This cantrip was effectively the opposite of the ''[[freshen]]'' cantrip except that the effects were permanent. The spell had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could be used on things like milk, alcoholic beverages, meat, raw vegetables, cut flowers, [[herb]]s, and similar items. The quantity that could be affected was about a bushel of vegetables, the meat of one [[sheep]], or a cask of liquid of similar size. Vegetable matter wilted, milk soured and became lumpy, and meat became rancid, but the effects of this spell were not as potent as ''[[Purify food and drink|putrefy food and drink]]''.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pointed their thumb downward while making a retching sound."
