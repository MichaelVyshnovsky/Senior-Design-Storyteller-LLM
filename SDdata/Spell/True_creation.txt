'''''True creation''''' was an extremely powerful spell that created almost any nonmagical object.

==Effects==
The spell automatically created an object of up to {{SI|15|cu.ft|long=yes}}, or more for a more powerful caster. Unlike with lesser spells such as [[minor creation]] or [[major creation]], the end result was permanent, nonmagical, and could be used as a material component; for all intents and purposes, they were actually real. However, the caster was still limited by their own skill when dealing with more complex items.

==Components==
The spell required a small sample of the matter to be created, and consumed the caster's lifeforce and knowledge in proportion to the value of the matter generated, with a lower limit.
