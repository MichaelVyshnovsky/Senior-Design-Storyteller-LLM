True creation was an extremely powerful spell that created almost any nonmagical object.
The spell automatically created an object of up to , or more for a more powerful caster. Unlike with lesser spells such as minor creation or major creation, the end result was permanent, nonmagical, and could be used as a material component for all intents and purposes, they were actually real. However, the caster was still limited by their own skill when dealing with more complex items.
The spell required a small sample of the matter to be created, and consumed the casters lifeforce and knowledge in proportion to the value of the matter generated, with a lower limit.
