'''''Cause fear''''' was a [[cleric]] [[prayer]] [[spell]] used by both divine and arcane spellcasters. It could cause a creature to flee in panic from the caster. Older versions of this spell were reversible, known as ''[[remove fear]]'', and bolstered the morale and courage of the recipients.

==Effects==
This spell/prayer has evolved over time: the prayer version could be used against a single creature within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}, whereas the pre-[[Spellplague]] spell could effect more than one creature in a {{SIAdj|30|ft}} area if the caster had sufficient experience. The oldest version of ''cause fear'' required the caster to successfully touch a single target. All versions filled the victims with dread and compelled them to flee the caster if they could not muster the will to resist. The victim could avoid obstacles and hazards but it was more vulnerable to enemy assault.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. After the [[Second Sundering]], only [[Verbal component|verbal]] components were required.
