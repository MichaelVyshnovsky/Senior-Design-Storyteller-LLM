        "mainbody": "Command was an enchantment spell that forced one subject to briefly obey a one-word command.\nThe command word had to be given in a language the subject could understand and the effect lasted for only one minute.\nCommands that were known to work included approach, back, drop, fall, flee, fly, go, halt, leave, rest, run, sleep, stop, and surrender.\nOlder versions of this spell could be overcome by creatures of high intelligence or toughness. Newer versions could be overcome by beings of strong will. \nCommand only affected living creatures with sufficient intelligence to understand the command word. Undead were completely unaffected.\nOnly the utterance of the command word was necessary to cast this spell."
