        "mainbody": "'''''Ironskin''''', sometimes called '''''iron skin''''' or '''''iron skins''''', was a touch-based [[divine]] [[spell]] that granted immunity to physical attacks.",
        "Effects": "''Iron skin'' protected a single target from attacks from [[weapon]]s, both enchanted and normal, as well as other physical attacks, such as those from [[animal]]s. However, the recipient of the spell was still affected by [[magic]]al barrages. Every physical attack reduced a 'layer' of the skin, but a more experienced [[priest]] could increase the number of layers.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a small [[iron]] stone worth no less than 5 [[gp]]."
