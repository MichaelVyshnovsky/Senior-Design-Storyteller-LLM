        "mainbody": "Ironskin, sometimes called iron skin or iron skins, was a touch-based divine spell that granted immunity to physical attacks.\nIron skin protected a single target from attacks from weapons, both enchanted and normal, as well as other physical attacks, such as those from animals. However, the recipient of the spell was still affected by magical barrages. Every physical attack reduced a layer of the skin, but a more experienced priest could increase the number of layers.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as a small iron stone worth no less than 5 gp."
