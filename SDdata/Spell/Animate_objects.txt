'''''Animate objects''''' (also seen as '''''animate object''''') was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to temporarily bring to life one or more inanimate objects to attack a designated target.

==Effects==
This spell could [[Animated object|animate objects]] made of any non-magical material such as [[ceramic]], fabric, [[glass]], [[leather]], metal, or wood. For the older transmutation version of this spell, the number of objects a caster could animate depended on how experienced he or she was. For the newer version, it was limited to a maximum of ten small objects.  Regardless of version, as the objects grow larger in size, fewer can be animated.  For example, ten candlesticks versus five chairs.

For the alteration versions this spell, the focus was on volume rather than on quantity, the size of the volume also dependent on the caster's experience.

The duration of ''animate objects'' also varied based on the caster's experience, and the objects immediately attacked a target designated by the caster. The movement rate, attack method, and possible damage depended on the form of the objects and their weight.<ref group="note">The spell descriptions for the alteration varieties of ''animate objects'' give various examples of movement rates of objects. A wooden statue with distinguishable legs would move considerably faster than the stone pedestal it was resting on, for example. The v.3.5 transmutation spell description directs the reader to the ''[[Monster Manual 3.5|Monster Manual]]'' for statistics of [[animated object]]s. Depending on the school, objects being carried or worn by person or creature were either difficult or impossible to animate.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''animate objects'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
