Blinding beauty was a transmutation spell that made the caster as beautiful as a nymph, allowing them to blind humanoids that gazed upon them.
The caster acquired a nymphs supernatural physical beauty for about forty-two seconds, or longer for more capable casters. Any humanoid within 60 feet (18 meters) who saw him or her directly risked being permanently blinded, similar to the blindness spell, if they could lack the fortitude to resist. However, the caster could quickly and easily suppress the blinding effect if he or she so desired, while staying just as beautiful.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the caster required to practice abstinence, by abstaining from sex for one week before casting.
