Lesser spell breach was an abjuration spell cast by sorcerers and wizards.
This spell stripped the target of up to two magical defenses (such as globe of invulnerability, stoneskin, protection from elements, death armor, or mage armor), starting from the most potent one. It also reduced the targets resistance against magic slightly for a minute.
The spell required verbal and somatic components.
