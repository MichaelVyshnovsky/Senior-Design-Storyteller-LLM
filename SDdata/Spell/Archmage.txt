'''Archmages''' were among the most powerful [[arcane spellcaster]]s found throughout all of [[Faerûn]]. These practitioners of [[the Art]] were experts at manipulating and altering their [[spell]]s, often in strange ways.

==Culture==
Many cities across Faerûn had a single archmage who dedicated themselves to serve that settlement and its people. Some notable cities included [[Lyrabar]] in [[Impiltur]], and the great [[West Faerûn|western]] metropolis of [[Waterdeep]].<ref name=CoS.W-p21">

The term "archmage" was often used to refer to  spellcasters who took on leadership roles among similarly-inclined practitioners of [[The Art]]. In the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]], the head of the arcane academy known as [[Sorcere]] was granted the title, [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]]. Similarly, the leader of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] was referred to as the [[Archmage Arcane]].

==Abilities==
Archmages continued developing their skills as spellcasters in the same manner as they had during their previous experiences in the Art. While they gained knowledge and lore about "[[high arcana]]" (that typical [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s had no knowledge of), they were forced to focus less on the number of spells they could prepare each day.

By forgoing one of their most powerful spells, archmages could tap into a power known as ''[[arcane fire]]''. This arcane fire was essentially a bolt of [[raw magic]]al energy that was drawn from the power they typically reserved for normal spellcasting.

They learned techniques that allowed them to reach across long distances, using spells that normally took effect upon touch and utilizing them from as far away as {{SI|30|ft}}.

As archmages were considered master spellcasters, it followed that they were capable of mastering particular elements of spellcasting. Rather than performing typical ''[[counterspell]]ing'', archmages could ''[[spell turning|turn spells back upon their casters]]''. They mastered ways to alter their spells that drew upon the elements, particularly those that were [[:Category:Acid spells|acidic]], [[:Category:cold spells|cold]], [[:category:fire spells|fiery]], [[:Category:Electricity spells|electric]], or [[:Category:Sonic spells|sonic]] in nature. Additionally, they perfected the practice of "spell shaping", and could readily manipulate the area over which a spell took effect.

Plainly put, the spells cast by archmages were capable of a level of power unheard of by typical spellcasters. Overall, they functioned more intensely than lesser experienced wizards and sorcerers. By forgoing one of the spells they would normally prepare, they could cast a spell twice in a day or more, without having to normally inscribing it within their ''[[spellbook]]''.

==Members==
Many [[sun elves]] who wished to continue their arcane studies often chose the path of the archmage, as did many of the [[human]] [[Red Wizards]].
