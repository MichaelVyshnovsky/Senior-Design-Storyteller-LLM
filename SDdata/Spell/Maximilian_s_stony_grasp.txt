'''''Maximilian's stony grasp''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Maximilian]].<ref group="note">It is possible that Maximilian himself is a Realms character. It is known from ''[[Heroes of the Elemental Chaos]]'' that Maximilian was a [[sorcerer]] who disappeared into the Underdark. It is stated in an earlier Realms source, ''[[Menzoberranzan (boxed set)|Menzoberranzan]]'', that certain spells were "developed in the Underdark" and then showed up "in surface lands, even in other worlds". One spell given in this list is ''Maximilian's stony grasp''. This could imply that Maximilian ventured to the Underdark of [[Toril]] and invented this spell. However, it is possible that this spell is simply a variant of ''Maximilian's earthen grasp'', and the ''stony'' version was inspired by Maximilian, not developed by him. Other examples of inspired spells are present in the lore, such as ''[[Bigby's snapping digits]]'' and varieties of [[Snilloc]]'s spells. Furthermore, it has been clarified by Wizards of the Coast, such as co-lead designer of 5{{th}} edition, [[Mike Mearls]], that nobody knows who Maximilian was.[https://twitter.com/mikemearls/status/956425952589856768]

==Effects==
This spell caused a man-sized arm of stone to rise from the ground beneath a targeted creature. The arm immediately tried to grab the leg of the target. If successful, the arm would severely impede the target's movement and make it much harder for them to defend themselves.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a miniature hand carved from stone to cast. The carving would crumble to dust when either the hand was destroyed or the spell expired. Additionally, this spell needed to be cast upon stone ground, be it natural or artificial, to function.

==History==
This spell was developed by Maximilian while in the [[Underdark]], but later on it found usage by some on the surface.<ref>
