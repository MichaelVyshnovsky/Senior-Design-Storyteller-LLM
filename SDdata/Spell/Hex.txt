Hex was a spell used by warlocks to curse a creature.
A caster was able to use this spell to curse a creature within . The target creature had to be within sight of the caster. When cursed, the creature suffered debilitating necrotic damage until the spell expired. Remove curse could be used to remove the curse. The length of time a creature remained cursed was determined by the casters skill level.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component. This took the form of an eye of a newt, which had to be petrified.
