Etherwalk was a special divine alteration quest spell from the astral and travelers spheres that transported the caster and their followers to the Ethereal plane.
The caster could bring up to fifty followers with them provided they all joined hands when the spell was cast. Up to three round-trip journeys could then be made through the Inner Planes before the spell transported the participants back to the Prime Material plane.
This spell did not require spell components of any kind.
This spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power.
