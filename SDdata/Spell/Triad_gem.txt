'''''Triad gem''''' was a very rare and powerful [[spell]] that allowed a caster to store and cast three spells.

==Effects==
The spell allowed a caster to store three spells into a [[gem]]. The caster first cast this spell onto the desired gemstone, and then normally cast three other spells. Afterwards, when the gem was in the possession of the caster, they were able to either cast all three spells simultaneously or one after another, the order of which was determined by the caster while casting ''triad gem''. The caster was also able to set a secret command word, so the gem could be used by another individual. If the gem was broken, all three stored spells released at once. The gem had to be used within six days, else it would vanish.

==Casting==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a gemstone with a value of at least 500 [[gp]]. The gem had to have been enchanted or had an ''[[eternal flame]]'' spell cast upon it. In addition, the caster required the material components, if any, of the spells they wished to store.

==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
