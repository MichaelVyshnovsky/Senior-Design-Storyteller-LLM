It conveyed a short message to a nearby entity, alerting them of the casters presence if they were not already cognizant.\nThis cantrip worked on one target creature within The original range was  as specified in Dragon #100 and Pages from the Mages but was halved in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. that the caster could see. This spell did not amplify the casters voice and could not overcome any sound barriers between the caster and the target, nor hearing impediments (such as deafness or magical silence). In addition, the target had to understand the language the caster used for precise meaning to be conveyed. It was most useful across a crowded room or a busy street. The message sent could be up to about six words long and did not, by itself, interfere with the concentration or spellcasting of the target creature.But a humorous quip might, for example. Unlike the message spell and cantrip, the recipient could not reply to the sender.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster first pointed at the target creature, then back at themselves while saying the word \"ahem\". It was the visual line-of-sight and not the pointing that determined the target.\nThis cantrip was one of three unique cantrips (along with horn and scorch) recorded in Glanvyls Workbook, penned by the relatively unknown Glanvyl of Scornubel in the 11 century DR.The three cantrips described in Dragon #100 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
