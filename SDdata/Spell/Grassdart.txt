Grassdart was a spell used by divine spellcasters of the Malatran Plateau who did not worship gods, instead their magics were granted by the spirits.
When the spell was cast, it transformed grass within , usually two to seven blades, into hardened, sharp, and dangerous weapons. Some taller types of grass, like that found in the savannah of Malatra, transformed into javelin-like weapons, while shooter grass types were turned into dart-like weapons. The hardened grass of an appropriate size could be crafted into quality arrows with added fletching. When the spell was cast on still-growing plants, they transformed into a deadly bed of sharp blades. The grass affected by the spell remained tough for one minute.
The spells material components were suitable blades of grass that were transformed in the process.
