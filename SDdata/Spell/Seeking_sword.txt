'''''Seeking sword''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Helm]], enabling them to conjure a shimmering blade of force.

==Effects==
This spell conjured a shimmer [[sword]] of force shaped however the caster desired. The sword hovered in the air and moved where the caster willed it to a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. The blade was incredibly swift, striking multiple times when directed at an enemy. The sword could also be finely manipulated to perform intricate tasks such as turning pages and opening doors. The caster needed to maintain focus to use the sword, preventing any other actions while the spell was active.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[human]] hair and a drop of mercury to cast.
