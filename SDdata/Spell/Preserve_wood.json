        "mainbody": "'''''Preserve wood''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that permanently protected a quantity of wood from magical alteration.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast on a wooden structure, such as a ship, to prevent the wood from being magically deformed by ''[[warp wood]]'' and similar spells. It could permanently protect up to 100 lb (45 kg) of wood per level of the caster, but could only be used on one structure per casting. For example, a portion of a ship's hull could be protected, but a separate casting would be required to protect a cargo crate aboard the ship.\n\nIt was possible for casters of higher level to overcome the protection provided by this spell.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "This spell was associated with the pirates roaming the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]."
