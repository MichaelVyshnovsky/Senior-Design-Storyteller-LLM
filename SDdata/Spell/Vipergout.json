        "mainbody": "Vipergout was an arcane conjuration spell that gave the caster the ability to spit out snakes.\nVipergout did two things. First, it gave the caster the ability to spit out as if they had been summoned with a summon monster spell. The snakes could be commanded to do anything from moving small objects to fighting to the death. The only exceptions to this rule were attacking the caster, attacking another summoned snake, and attacking itself. This bond between snakes and caster was virtually unbreakable&mdashnothing except killing one side of the bond could destroy it. Even means like dispel magic were useless in this regard.\nThe caster spat out the snakes without harm to him or herself, but it prevented the caster from speaking, and therefore, from using spells with verbal components or verbally triggered magic items. Other than speaking, the spell prevented no actions. The snakes did not actually appear in the mouth but they seemed like they did so. \nThe summoned snakes were either capable of a poisonous bite or were of the constrictor variety, but otherwise unremarkable, including their medium size. However, they were considered either celestial or fiendish creatures.\nCasting vipergout required somatic and verbal components, plus a piece of snake skin as a material component.\nThis spell was originally associated solely with the scalykind, but by the 14 century DR, the drow had mastered it also."
