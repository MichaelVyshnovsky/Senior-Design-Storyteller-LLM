Spell rebirth was an advanced utterance from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used truespeak to reactivate a dispelled spell, or actually dispelled it, if reversed.
In its straight form, spell rebirth unwound a lost spell back to existence, if its duration had not completely elapsed. In its reversed form, it dispelled spells.
The recitation was known to loquasphinxes and garblers, the latter using only its reversed form.
