'''''Spell rebirth''''' was an advanced [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] to reactivate a ''dispelled'' spell, or actually dispelled it, if reversed.

==Usage==
In its straight form, ''spell rebirth'' unwound a lost spell back to existence, if its duration had not completely elapsed. In its reversed form, it dispelled spells.

==History==
The recitation was known to [[loquasphinx]]es and [[garbler]]s, the latter using only its reversed form.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|267-269}}
