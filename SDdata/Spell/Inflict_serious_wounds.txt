'''''Inflict serious wounds''''', also known as '''''cause serious wounds''''', was a [[necromancy]] spell that caused heavy damage to a creature touched by the caster.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the caster channeled [[negative energy]] which did harm to living beings. Since [[undead]] were powered by negative energy, this spell cured them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.

The reverse of this spell, ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', channeled [[positive energy]] and had the exact opposite effect (healed the living, harmed the undead).
