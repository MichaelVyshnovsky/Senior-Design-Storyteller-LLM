'''''Cling''''' was a  spell used by [[drow]]. It was very rarely used by other races.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell allowed the caster or a target creature to cling to any vertical or horizontal surface. The spell was unaffected by the effects of gravity, weight, wind or the texture of the surface. Unlike ''[[Spider climb (drow)|spider climb]]'', this spell did not allow for movement, but the recipient was able to perform tasks such as casting a spell or tie knots. During casting, a part of the body was chosen, and had to remain in contact with the surface. If the surface was destroyed or the recipient was struck by a heavy object, the spell expired. Otherwise, the spell was ended by uttering a command word. 

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
