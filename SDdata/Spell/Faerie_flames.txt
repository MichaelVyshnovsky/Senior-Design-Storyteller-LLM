Faerie flames was a very rare spell used by elven clerics.
This spell was a more powerful variant of faerie fire. When cast, this spell, like faerie fire, outlined a target in a fiery glow. However, this spell inflicted damage to the targeted creature or object. The flames could not be extinguished like regular fire, so dousing in water or smothering the target had no effect. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic and magical means of extinguishing fire such as a wand of flame extinguishing.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components  of sulfur and a piece of foxfire. The material components were consumed by the spell during casting.
