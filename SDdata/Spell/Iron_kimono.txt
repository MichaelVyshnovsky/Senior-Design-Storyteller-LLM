Iron kimono was a common protective spell used by geisha. The spell was sometimes used by wu jen and was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.
A geisha used this spell to turn their kimono, obi or tabi into armor. The clothing did not change in appearance nor did it restrict movement.
The spell required somatic and verbal components.
