        "mainbody": "Acidic blast was an arcane acid-based spell developed by either the baatezu or the tanarri for use in their never-ending Blood War.\nThis spell allowed a spellcaster to conjure forth a violent torrent of caustic fluid from one of their hands. This blast of acid shot out in a straight line, to as far as , and wherever it landed a splash would result causing collateral damage to anything within .\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.\nIt is unknown which of the fiends created acidic blast, nor does anyone care to set the record straight, as whichever side created it first had their work copied and stolen by the other. For a long period this spell was not known to anyone outside of the baatezu and tanarri, as both sides guarded the knowledge of it, fearing it would be too great a weapon in the hands of mortals and celestials. However, eventually a planewalking mage stole a spellbook from some baatezu wizards and fled with it to Sigil, wherein she was able to decipher the spell before the fiends could track her down and put a stop to her efforts. Since then it began to circulate amongst wizards that lived in that planar city."
