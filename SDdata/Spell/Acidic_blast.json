        "mainbody": "'''''Acidic blast''''' was an [[arcane]] [[acid]]-based [[spell]] developed by either the [[baatezu]] or the [[tanar'ri]] for use in their never-ending [[Blood War]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a spellcaster to conjure forth a violent torrent of caustic fluid from one of their hands. This blast of acid shot out in a straight line, to as far as {{SI|100|yard|long=yes}}, and wherever it landed a splash would result causing collateral damage to anything within {{SI|5|long=yes}}.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.",
        "History": "It is unknown which of the [[fiend]]s created ''acidic blast'', nor does anyone care to set the record straight, as whichever side created it first had their work copied and stolen by the other. For a long period this spell was not known to anyone outside of the baatezu and tanar'ri, as both sides guarded the knowledge of it, fearing it would be too great a weapon in the hands of mortals and [[celestial]]s. However, eventually a [[planewalking]] mage stole a [[spellbook]] from some baatezu wizards and fled with it to [[Sigil]], wherein she was able to decipher the spell before the fiends could track her down and put a stop to her efforts. Since then it began to circulate amongst wizards that lived in that planar city."
