Shatterbone was a necromancy spell that was used to fight the undead.
When cast, a shimmering beam of gray light shot out from the casters body in a single direction, and it was immobile. It caused the bones of undead creatures to explode. This was particularly effective when facing skeletons, as the spell would turn their remains to dust, thus preventing their bones from being collected and used once again.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component glass shaped as a polished gemstone. At one point the glass had to have been exposed to the light from the sun at noon.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
