'''''Tree shape''''', also called just '''''tree''''', was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to take the form of a large tree or shrub for a few hours.

==Effects==
When cast, the caster and all the caster's clothing and accouterments changed into a live tree or shrub, or a dead trunk with only a few dead limbs. While in tree form the caster could not move, but could see and hear all that took place in the immediate environment, just as if the caster were standing there normally. The transformation passed all mundane tests and the closest scrutiny, but ''[[detect magic]]'' registered faint transmutation magic.

''Tree shape'' could be dismissed instantly by the caster before the spell expired, with no recovery time or lingering detrimental effects.

While in tree form, the transmutation version of this spell conferred additional natural armor to the caster and made it impossible for a single blow to do critical damage.

==Components==
The newer version of ''tree shape'' required the use of the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]] as well as the usual [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components. The older alteration version also required a twig from a tree.
