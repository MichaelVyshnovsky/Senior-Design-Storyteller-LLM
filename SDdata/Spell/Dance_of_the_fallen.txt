'''''Dance of the fallen''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tempus]], enabling them to subdue foes.

==Effects==
This spell was used to subdue foes whom the caster did not wish to harm. This spell created a whirling wall of bloodless severed limbs where the caster desired. The barrier's diameter could between {{SI|5|ft}}â€“{{SI|60|ft}} as determined by the caster. Any creatures attempting to pass through the barrier would be pummeled by the whirling limbs and risked being knocked senseless. Only a quarter of the harm caused by the ''dance of the fallen'' was permanent, with the remainder being experienced only within a target's mind.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a handful of bone shards or hair to cast.
