        "mainbody": "'''''Secret page''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that hid the contents of a page behind the appearance that something else was written on it.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting the spell, the user determined a command word that could reveal the secret contents and then return the page to its disguised state. Speaking the command word twice ended the spell altogether. A page affected by ''secret page'' was impervious to spells such as ''[[comprehend languages]]''. Moreover, spells such as ''[[confuse languages]]'' and ''[[explosive runes]]'' could be cast on it, but only affected the false text. ''[[Erase]]'' was also ineffective: it destroyed the entire writing. Only a combination of ''[[true seeing]]'' and ''comprehend languages'' could bypass the illusion.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials required were a powder made of [[herring]] scales and the essence of either a [[boggart]] or of a [[will-o'-wisp]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Ptack]] in {{Yearlink|-503}} and was originally called '''''Ptack's secret script'''''."
