'''''Elemental bane''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that temporarily suppressed a creature's resistance to a chosen element and amplified its effect of the target.

==Effects==
The caster chose one element out of the possible options of [[acid]], cold, [[fire]], lightning, or thunder, then cast the spell on a creature within a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. More creatures could be affected by more powerful casters. If unable to resist, the affected creature lost any natural or magical resistance to the chosen element, and took additional damage every time it was damaged by it. The effect lasted for 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
