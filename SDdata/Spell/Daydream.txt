Daydream was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Brandobaris, the Master of Stealth. It distracted a creature, making it less likely they would notice anything unusual in their immediate environment.
This spell could be cast on a single creature from up to  away (farther for more experienced casters). The target had a chance to resist daydream, but otherwise they were under the influence of the spell for at least one minute (longer for more experienced casters) or until they succeeded in noticing something was amiss. While daydreaming, the target was less observant, less perceptive, more easily surprised, and less likely to notice someone attempting to move quietly or hide in the shadows. Small clues were missed and little discrepancies were overlooked. In addition, because the spell had no verbal component, the victim did not even know that the spell was cast, as long as it was done discreetly.
This spell required only somatic components and a pinch of fine sand as the material component.
