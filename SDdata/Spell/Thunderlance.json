        "mainbody": "'''''Thunderlance''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] spell that created a [[spear]] of force that could be used as a weapon and had the ability to dispel some defensive magics. One version also absorbed certain magic projectiles and added their damage to its own.",
        "Effects": "For a number of minutes, the caster could wield a spear-like force that extended from his or her pointed finger. It was shimmering, faintly gray, could vary in length up to 20 ft (6.1 m), and was perfectly straight. No skill was required to wield ''thunderlance'': an earlier version ignored all non-natural armor, and the later version struck as if the caster had great strength. The lance faded away at the will of the caster, if the caster lost consciousness or cast another spell, or at the end of its duration.\n\nSome magical force protections were dispelled by the touch of a ''thunderlance''. The later version could dispel ''[[shield]]'', ''[[mage armor]]'', and any other force-based spell of 3rd level or below. The earlier version could even dispel a ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'' and other [[abjuration]] spells of the same level or less. In addition, the ''thunderlance'' absorbed ''[[magic missile]]s'', ''[[Snilloc's snowball]]s'', and other force-projectiles&mdash;one missile for every three caster levels&mdash;and use that magical energy to boost its damage on the next successful hit.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a small metal spear as a [[material component]]. The earlier version specifically required the spear be made of [[silver]].",
        "History": "This spell was first known to appear in the [[Aubayreer's Workbook|spell tome]] of the [[Mage-king]] [[Aubayreer]].<ref> In [[1359 DR]] it was was published in \"[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]\" and became generally known to the magical community."
