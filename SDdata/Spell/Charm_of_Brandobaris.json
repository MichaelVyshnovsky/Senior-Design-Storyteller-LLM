        "mainbody": "Charm of Brandobaris was a spell used by clerics of Brandobaris.\nWhen in captivity, the caster could use this spell to convince several of their captors that they were much too valuable to be slain or eaten. The spell caused uncertainty and doubt among the captors, who came to believe the caster instead had to be ransomed, not tortured, or, at the very least, an individual with more authority had to be consulted. The spell was even effective against animals. However, the spell did not allow the caster to communicate more effectively with their captors. The targeted creature had to be within  of the caster.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
