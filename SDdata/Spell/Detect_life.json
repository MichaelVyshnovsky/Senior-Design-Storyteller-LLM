        "mainbody": "Detect life was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.\nThis spell gave a shugenja the ability to determine if a creature was alive. It was cast on a creature in a coma, trance or unconscious. The spell was able to detect life even if the creature was under a feign death spell. Mental protections prevented the spell from functioning, as well as metal of any thickness.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, the holy symbol of a shugenja."
