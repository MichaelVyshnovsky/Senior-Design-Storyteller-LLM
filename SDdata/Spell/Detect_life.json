        "mainbody": "'''''Detect life''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "This spell gave a shugenja the ability to determine if a creature was alive. It was cast on a creature in a coma, trance or unconscious. The spell was able to detect life even if the creature was under a ''[[feign death]]'' spell. Mental protections prevented the spell from functioning, as well as metal of any thickness.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], the holy symbol of a shugenja."
