'''''Falling wall''''' was a [[spell]] that could weaken a wall.
 
==Effects==
During the length of the spell, the caster had to remain in physical contact with the targeted wall. The spell only weakened masonry, mortar and stone. The damage inflicted by the spell was the equivalent of several years worth of exposure to the elements. The spell could affect an area of up to {{SI|5|cu ft|long=yes}}. This area grew as the caster became more skilled.
 
==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.

==History==
''Falling wall'' was one of the spells found in ''[[Leaves of Green]]'', a divine spellbook and a holy book of [[Silvanus]].
