        "mainbody": "Dreamglobe  was a divination spell that would trap its target in a sphere of force that resembled a sepia snake sigil, keeping them floating in a dream-like state for 24 hours.\nOnce per day, the caster could attempt to try and get information from the target while they were under the effects of this spell. Certain spells and items like mind blank or amulet of proof against detection and location could be used to protect a creature from interrogation.\nThe only way to get someone out of the dreamglobe was to wait the day-long duration of the spell or shatter the globe itself.\nThis spell required the material component of a crystal sphere and a piece of amber."
