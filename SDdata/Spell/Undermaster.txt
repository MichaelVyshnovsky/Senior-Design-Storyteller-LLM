Undermaster was a transmutation spell that gave the caster a wide range of earth-related spells.
On casting Undermaster, the caster gained the ability to innately cast a wide range of spells as long as he or she was in contact with the ground. The spells in question were burrow, earthquake, excavate, flesh to stone, meld into stone, move earth, reverse gravity, soften earth and stone, statue, stone shape, stone sphere, stone tell, stone to flesh, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and wall of stone. Each of these spells could be cast once per day.
Undermaster required only verbal components, but casting this spell drained also the casters essence.
