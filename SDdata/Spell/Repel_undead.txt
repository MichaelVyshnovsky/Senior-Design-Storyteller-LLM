'''''Repel undead''''' was a [[necromancy|necromantic]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used to drive [[undead]] creatures away from the caster.

==Effects==
This spell created a powerful compulsion within undead creatures, prompting them to avoid the caster. If any kind of physical barrier prevented the undead from doing this then they simply kept as much distance between them and the caster as possible. This spell was centered on the caster and moved about with them.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components this spell required a magnet with a drop of the caster's blood placed at one end and a bone fragment placed at the other.

==Development==
''Repel undead'' spell was originally developed by the [[tiefling]] [[Grand Vizar]] of [[Calimshan]], known as [[Shangalar the Black]], having been recorded in his [[Book of Shangalar the Black|personal spellbook]].
