        "Effect": "This spell allowed either the spellcaster or the touched target to see in absolute darkness up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. The duration of the bestowed vision scaled with the experience of the caster. Most versions of the spell permitted vision only in black and white, although post-[[Second Sundering]], sages reported that the spell could grant color vision. The spell did not function in magical darkness.\n\nFor some variations of the spell, highly luminous sources, such as torches or a blazing fire, essentially blinded this vision. Thus, the spell was usually used in dark areas only, since it would have hindered the recipient in well-lit areas.\n\n''Darkvision'' could be made permanent with ''[[permanency]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component|material]] components. The material component could either be an [[agate]] stone or a pinch of dried [[carrot]].",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]], [[Nalevac]], in {{Yearlink|-2005}}. ''Infravision'' was also detailed in ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'', as well as ''[[The Alcaister]]'', and the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]''."
