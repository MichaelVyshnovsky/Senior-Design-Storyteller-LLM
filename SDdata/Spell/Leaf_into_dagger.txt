'''''Leaf into dagger''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that transformed a single leaf into a [[dagger]] that could be wielded by the [[cleric]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell transformed a single leaf, taken from a plant of any species, into an unbreakable, non-metallic dagger. It was exceptionally sharp, didn't reflect light, and possessed a ''+2 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.

The dagger immediately disappeared if it was intentionally let go by the casting cleric or if thrown as a projectile weapon.

==History==
The specifications of ''leaf into dagger'' were inscribed upon one of the "inner petals" of the [[Chauntea]]n [[relic]], the ''[[Glarathra]]''.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast, along with a single leaf taken from any plant.
