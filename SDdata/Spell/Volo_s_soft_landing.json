        "mainbody": "'''''Volo's soft landing''''' was a simple protective [[arcane]] [[spell]] created by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Master Traveler of the Realms, sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effects": "The effects of this [[cantrip]] were similar to the ''[[feather fall]]'' spell but could only be applies to a single fall or descent of a single item (including a chain of attached items). Such descent could not excess the length of the caster's forearm. As such, ''Volo's soft landing'' was a spell used to quietly drop an item that, otherwise, would make a noticeable sound, like a [[dagger]], or a keychain. The spell's subject was selected via touch during the casting and its magic remained active for five minutes.",
        "Components": "''Volo's soft landing'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. The material component was any sort of lightweight floating plant seed or pappus, such as fluffy [[dandelion]] or [[milkweed]] seeds."
