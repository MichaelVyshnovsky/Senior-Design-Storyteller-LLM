        "mainbody": "Volos soft landing was a simple protective arcane spell created by Volothamp Geddarm, Master Traveler of the Realms, sometime before the late 15 century DR.\nThe effects of this cantrip were similar to the feather fall spell but could only be applies to a single fall or descent of a single item (including a chain of attached items). Such descent could not excess the length of the casters forearm. As such, Volos soft landing was a spell used to quietly drop an item that, otherwise, would make a noticeable sound, like a dagger, or a keychain. The spells subject was selected via touch during the casting and its magic remained active for five minutes.\nVolos soft landing required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. The material component was any sort of lightweight floating plant seed or pappus, such as fluffy dandelion or milkweed seeds."
