        "Effects": "The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and no larger than {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}}. It permeated the area with a thin cloud of mist that left a residue of water on all surfaces. This had the effect of making objects more difficult to light on fire, but it also degraded parchment and other water-susceptible surfaces. Creatures looking into, out of, or through the area of effect could still see normally but found some details were obscured by the fog.",
        "Components": "The [[somatic component]] of this cantrip was an uplifted hand with wiggling fingers. The [[verbal component]] could be either a hummed tune or a low hooting sound."
