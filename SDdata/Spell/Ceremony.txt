'''''Ceremony''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s to perform a magically infused religious ceremony. 

==Effects==
For the spell to be effective, the caster had to come into physical contact with the target creature. The spell allowed the caster to perform a variety of rites:
* '''Atonement''': The cleric was able to restore a creature to their natural [[alignment]].
* '''Bless Water''': Transformed a vial of water into [[holy water]].
* '''Coming of Age''': When used on a young creature, they temporarily gained the skills of an adult. 
* '''Dedication''': Used when a creature became dedicated to the cleric's [[deity]].
* '''Funeral Rite''': Prevented a corpse from becoming [[undead]] for up to a week.
* '''Wedding''': Used during wedding ceremonies.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: powdered [[silver]] with a value of at least 25 [[gp]]. Older versions of the spell varied in the material component required based upon the religion of the caster, but always involved use of the priest's [[holy symbol]].
