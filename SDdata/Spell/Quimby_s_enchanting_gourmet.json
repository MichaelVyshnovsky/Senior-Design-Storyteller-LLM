        "mainbody": "Quimbys enchanting gourmet was an arcane conjuration and summoning spell dedicated to cooking a meal and to cleaning up a kitchen afterwards. It was also a spell of the Servants Path in the paths of power system of magic.\nIt was a specialized version of the unseen servant spell, producing a magical force capable only of activities related to cooking and other kitchen tasks, such as measuring and cutting ingredients, carrying pots and pans, stirring and turning foodstuffs as they cooked, adding a garnish, and even minding a fire and washing dishes. It was just as strong as an unseen servant and just as dexterous as the mage who cast it. It appeared within  of the caster and was under their control, but could be left unattended provided it was cooking something the caster had once seen prepared or had prepared themselves, enabling the caster to focus on on other things.\nIt functioned for at least an hour, or longer according to the casters capabilities. It could be dispelled by the caster at will or by dispel magic, or else destroyed by attacking it or by forces that affected the area it was in.\nAs well as verbal and somatic components, the spell required as material components a block of wood and some string, and previously a drop of the casters blood.\nIt was more often used by sedentary or retired wizards and sages. Though it was incapable of brewing potions or other enchanted beverages, it was sometimes put to use creating simple poisons, and once served as a bartender.\nQuimby, a mage of the city of Procampur in the the Vast who lived some time prior to the late 9 century DR,As Quimbys enchanting gourmet appears in Jalusters Orizon, and Jaluster died at the fall of Ascalhorn (Hellgate Keep) in 882 DR, this implies that Quimby and the gourmet were in existence some time prior to that date. was a devoted gourmand but an impatient cook. For aid in preparing fine meals, Quimby modified the unseen servant spell to create Quimbys enchanting gourmet.\nDue to its narrow usefulness, it was not often studied by adventuring mages\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast a number of spells including Quimbys enchanting gourmet within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. These spells had an even chance of either not functioning or summoning a creature of the Outer Planes. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization. Later, when the planes-traveling Tower of the rakshasa Nimlimm Dinarr appeared outside the city, the wild magic around it would transform a fire burst spell into Quimbys enchanting gourmet, and vice versa countless spells were swapped in this way.\nA copy of Quimbys enchanting gourmet could be found in Jalusters Orizon, the last traveling spellbook of the mage Jaluster (died 882 DR).\nThe spell was also stored in the ring of wayfaring, one of the Seven Lost Rings of Mhzentul (1250â€“1340 DR).\nThis spell was likely one of a number found in the pamphlet Volos Guide to All Things Magical published in 1359 DR, which detailed a number of forgotten spells, and quickly spread to the mages of the world.\n* Landraf the Grey, a mage of Ravens Bluff\n* Andros Canterbury, an inventor mage of the Vasts Underdark\n* Dostrealt, a blind drow mage aboard the spelljammer Erevans Clutch.\n* Rouarthek, a drow mage of the Vasts Underdark"
