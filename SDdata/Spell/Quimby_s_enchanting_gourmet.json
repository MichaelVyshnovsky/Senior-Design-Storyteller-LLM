        "mainbody": "'''''Quimby's enchanting gourmet''''' was an [[arcane]] [[conjuration]] and [[summoning]] [[spell]] dedicated to cooking a meal and to cleaning up a kitchen afterwards. It was also a spell of the Servant's Path in the [[paths of power]] system of [[magic]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power|46}}<ref>",
        "Effect": "It was a specialized version of the ''[[unseen servant]]'' spell, producing a magical force capable only of activities related to cooking and other kitchen tasks, such as measuring and cutting ingredients, carrying pots and pans, stirring and turning foodstuffs as they cooked, adding a garnish, and even minding a fire and washing dishes. It was just as strong as an ''unseen servant'' and just as dexterous as the mage who cast it. It appeared within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and was under their control, but could be left unattended provided it was cooking something the caster had once seen prepared or had prepared themselves, enabling the caster to focus on on other things.\n\nIt functioned for at least an hour, or longer according to the caster's capabilities. It could be dispelled by the caster at will or by ''[[dispel magic]]'', or else destroyed by attacking it or by forces that affected the area it was in.",
        "Components": "As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the spell required as [[material component]]s a block of wood and some string, and previously a drop of the caster's blood.",
        "Usage": "It was more often used by sedentary or retired [[wizard]]s and sages. Though it was incapable of brewing [[potion]]s or other [[enchanted]] beverages, it was sometimes put to use creating simple [[poison]]s, and once served as a bartender.",
        "History": "[[Quimby]], a mage of the city of [[Procampur]] in the [[the Vast]] who lived some time prior to the late 9{{th}} century [[DR]],<ref group=\"note\">As ''Quimby's enchanting gourmet'' appears in ''Jaluster's Orizon'', and [[Jaluster]] died at the fall of [[Ascalhorn]] (Hellgate Keep) in [[882 DR]], this implies that Quimby and the ''gourmet'' were in existence some time prior to that date. was a devoted gourmand but an impatient cook. For aid in preparing fine meals, Quimby modified the ''unseen servant'' spell to create ''Quimby's enchanting gourmet''.\n\nDue to its narrow usefulness, it was not often studied by adventuring mages\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast a number of spells including ''Quimby's enchanting gourmet'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]].{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}} These spells had an even chance of either not functioning or summoning a creature of the [[Outer Planes]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Soulstorm|5}} In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization. Later, when the planes-traveling [[Tower (Nimlimm Dinarr)|Tower]] of the [[rakshasa]] [[Nimlimm Dinarr]] appeared outside the city, the [[wild magic]] around it would transform a ''[[fire burst]]'' spell into ''Quimby's enchanting gourmet'', and vice versa; countless spells were swapped in this way.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Live and Let Die/Slot 3|22,25}}{{LCRB}}",
        "Sources": "A copy of ''Quimby's enchanting gourmet'' could be found in ''[[Jaluster's Orizon]]'', the last traveling [[spellbook]] of the mage [[Jaluster]] (died [[882 DR]]).\n\nThe spell was also stored in the ''[[ring of wayfaring]]'', one of the [[Seven Lost Rings of Mhzentul|Seven Lost Rings]] of [[Mhzentul]] ([[1250 DR|1250]]â€“[[1340 DR]]).\n\nThis spell was likely one of a number found in the pamphlet [[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in Universe)|''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'']] published in [[1359 DR]], which detailed a number of forgotten spells, and quickly spread to the mages of the world.",
