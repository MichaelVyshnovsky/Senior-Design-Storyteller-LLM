'''''Keen edge''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that made a weapon magically sharp.

==Effect==
Applied to an edged or pointed weapon or up to fifty such projectiles, this spell doubled its ability to deal critical wounds for over 10 minutes, up to several hours.

==Applications==
''Keen edge'' was used for the ''[[keen]]'' weapon enhancement.

==History==
Keen magic such as this was first developed by the old noble houses of the [[elf]] realm of [[Cormanthyr]]. By [[1372 DR]], this legacy survived in the ''[[Cormanthyrian elfblade]]s'', ''keen'' [[longsword]]s that carried the symbols of these houses.
