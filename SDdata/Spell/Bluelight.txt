Bluelight was a personal cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It created a sphere of light that softly illuminated the immediate surroundings.
When cast, this cantrip created a  diameter sphere in the palm of the casters hand that gave off a soft, blue radiance. The light reached only  away in all directions and did not reveal anything beyond that radius. Because of this, a viewer from far away was struck by an eerie sense that something was not right. Bluelight did not inhibit or hinder natural or magical infravision or ultravision. The glowing globe lasted as long as the caster maintained concentration on it.
If the caster held an alicorn when casting bluelight, the sphere of light formed on the unicorns horn rather than his or her palm, and moved with the alicorn. The radiance continued to emit from the alicorn regardless of the distance between it and the caster, for as long as the caster maintained concentration.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components. The caster extended an open palm and spoke a simple rhyme that included the words "blue" and "light". ("Show me true, light of blue," for example.)
This cantrip was described on page three of Bowgentles Book, penned by the famous mage from Silverymoon.The three cantrips described in Dragon #97 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip.
