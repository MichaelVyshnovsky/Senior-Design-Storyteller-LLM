Dispel ward was a divine abjuration spell from the wards sphere used only by specialty priests devoted to Set called Nighthunters. It resembled a limited form of the dispel magic spell.
This spell was capable of cancelling magical wards, such as any spell from the wards sphere, wizard lock, symbol, glyph of warding, and similar spells. It was a weaker version of the dispel magic spell and depended on the priests skill for success. This spell had no effect against "wall" spells such as wall of fire or "sphere" spells such as prismatic sphere.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
