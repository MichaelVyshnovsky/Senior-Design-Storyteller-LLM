'''''Cocoon''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell trapped a targeted creature within a cocoon made from silkworm fibres. The creature was paralyzed while encased within the cocoon. While trapped, the cocoon slowly drained the life energy from the creature until it perished. The cocoon then transferred this energy to the caster, at this point the cocoon broke and fell to the ground, shrinking until it was roughly the size of a walnut. The cocooned creature could be freed if another creature attacked the cocoon with a sword, but this took some time as the cocoon's layers were strong.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], an intact cocoon from a silkworm.
