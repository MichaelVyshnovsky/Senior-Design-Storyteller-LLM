Battle line was an abjuration spell cast by divine spellcasters of Gruumsh who were initiated in their faiths magical secrets.
Battle line was a spell that instilled fear in any person that crossed a&mdashnot proverbial but actual&mdash"line in the sand" that was actually visible. People who crossed it, and were not strong of will, were subject to the aforementioned fear. People who had a sufficiently strong mind were immune for 24 hours to any battle line cast by the one they managed to defend themselves against, but only against that persons battle line. If multiple people cast the spell, then subjects needed to resist against every single one to acquire immunity against them all.
Battle line required somatic and verbal components. It also required a divine focus.
Battle line was a rare spell that was taught only among the divine spellcasters of Gruumsh and even among them only to those who were taught their faiths secrets.
