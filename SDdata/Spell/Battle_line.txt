'''''Battle line''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] cast by divine spellcasters of [[Gruumsh]] who were initiated in their faith's [[magic]]al secrets.

==Effects==
''Battle line'' was a spell that instilled fear in any person that crossed a&mdash;not proverbial but actual&mdash;"line in the sand" that was actually visible. People who crossed it, and were not strong of will, were subject to the aforementioned fear. People who had a sufficiently strong mind were immune for 24 hours to any ''battle line'' cast by the one they managed to defend themselves against, but only against that person's ''battle line''. If multiple people cast the spell, then subjects needed to resist against every single one to acquire immunity against them all.

==Components==
''Battle line'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s. It also required a [[divine focus]].

==History==
''Battle line'' was a rare spell that was taught only among the divine spellcasters of [[Gruumsh]] and even among them only to those who were taught their faith's secrets.
