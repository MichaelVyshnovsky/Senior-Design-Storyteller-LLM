        "mainbody": "Spellbind was a powerful divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Oghma, enabling them to bind a book with a living creature.\nThis spell allowed the caster to bind a book to a living creature when touching both. The spellbound target would suffer the same physical damage experience by the book, no matter how far away they were from the book. However, the target could vanish into the book and exit out of it whenever they wished. While within the book the target could still see, hear, and speak normally, but could not move around or feel anything. The target was undetectable by normal means while within the book. They could read the surface thoughts of anyone flipping through the books pages. All bodily process were suspended while the target remained in the book, including healing.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
