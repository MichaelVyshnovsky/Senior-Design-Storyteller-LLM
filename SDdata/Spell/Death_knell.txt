'''''Death knell''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that finished off a dying subject and sapped its energy to strengthen the caster.

==Effect==
After casting this spell and touching a critically wounded living creature who was close to death, the caster absorbed their dwindling life energy and added it to their own. The caster had a chance of killing the creature and if it died the caster became temporarily stronger and more powerful.  The duration of the spell lasted from a few minutes to several hours depending on the power of the target.

==Components==
It required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
