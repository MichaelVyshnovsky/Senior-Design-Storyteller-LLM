Death knell was a necromancy spell that finished off a dying subject and sapped its energy to strengthen the caster.
After casting this spell and touching a critically wounded living creature who was close to death, the caster absorbed their dwindling life energy and added it to their own. The caster had a chance of killing the creature and if it died the caster became temporarily stronger and more powerful.  The duration of the spell lasted from a few minutes to several hours depending on the power of the target.
It required only verbal and somatic components.
