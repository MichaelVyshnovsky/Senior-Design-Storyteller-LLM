Jonstals double wizardry was an arcane alteration spell that allowed a wizard to cast the spells invisibility and levitate simultaneously.
The caster had to have memorized all three spells and not have cast either invisibility or levitate before casting Jonstals double wizardry (unless the wizard had those spells memorized more than once).
Once activated, both invisibility and levitate took effect immediately on either the caster or a touched recipient.
Jonstals double wizardry itself had only a verbal component, but the material components for both invisibility and levitate were used as well.
This spell was invented by the archmage, Jonstal. Despite much research, Jonstal was only ever able to pair these two spells and two other spells. The other two spells were cast using Jonstals improved double wizardry. To his credit, the only other being known to be able to cast two spells at once was Azuth himself.
During one of their many spell-sharing sessions, Elminster shared this spell with the wizards Mordenkainen of Oerth and Dalamar of Krynn.
