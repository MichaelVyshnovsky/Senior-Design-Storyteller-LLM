        "mainbody": "Sandcone was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell was used to excavate a cone-sized area of sand where the caster desired. The tip of the cone faced downward. This spell only transported sand rocks and other objects within the cone remained in place and fell to the bottom of the cone when the sand was removed. Sand surrounding the cone would not fall into the opening as long as the caster concentrated.\nThis spell required the hair of a desert rat and a pinch of sand to cast."
