        "mainbody": "Incendiary sword is a spell used by several swordmages, particularly those who follow the astral fire path. When it is cast, incendiary sword causes the blade of the swordmage casting the spell to erupt into flames, which the swordmage then hurls to a location within twenty-five feet of him or herself. When the blade strikes the ground it erupts again, creating a fiery blast zone of roughly twenty-five feet in diameter, burning any creatures unfortunate enough to be caught within, burning them repeatedly for several minutes even after the fire has dissipated. The blade used in the attack disintegrates and reforms within the hand of its wielder nearly instantaneously. Incendiary sword can be reused after a short rest of a few minutes or more.\n*\nCategoryTransmutation spells\nCategorySwordmage spells\ntubep7d4dzjefptczdmeqto72ypll3q"
