        "mainbody": "Whispering sand was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell imbued a handful of sand with a message from the caster. The caster determined the specific sand that was to hold a message. Examples of this were a cup of sand, a small patch of sand near a gate, etc. The caster would determine specific conditions that would trigger the sand message to whisper to the recipient. This condition needed to occur within  of the sand. A wizard would then record a message into the sand more powerful wizards could record longer messages. Anyone within  could hear the message.\nThe sand could also be used to store any spell that only required a verbal component. The stored spell must be one known by the caster. The stored spell would trigger when the specific condition was met.\nThis spell required sand to cast."
