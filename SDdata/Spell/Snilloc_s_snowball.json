        "mainbody": "Snillocs snowball was an evocation spell in general use throughout the Realms.\nThis spell caused one ball of magical snow to instantly appear in the casters hand which could then be thrown at any creature or object within the range of the spells effect. The frigid projectile struck unerringly, like a magic missile, and could be deflected or negated by the same methods that worked against magic missile. At higher levels, the range of this spell was much greater than for magic missile, but it was limited to just the one snowball. Creatures with an affinity for fire were particularly susceptible to damage from this spell, taking up to twice as much damage as a non-fire-using creature.\nOther versions of this spell did not magically strike the opponent but had to be aimed and thrown&mdashor shoved against someone&mdashby the caster. In such cases, however, a replacement snowball could appear in the casters hand.\nVerbal and somatic components were necessary to cast this spell, as well as a chip of ice or a fleck of ivory.\n*Snillocs snowball swarm\n*There were rumors of a very similar spell with a different missile called Snillocs cream pie."
