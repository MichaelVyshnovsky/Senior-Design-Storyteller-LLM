The touched magical symbol was removed from its placement and held in the casters hand, allowing the caster to place the magical symbol in an appropriate location of their choosing. The magical symbol would function normally after being moved in this manner.\nThe magical symbol would instantly trigger on the caster, and only the caster, if their concentration was broken while holding the symbol.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of slate that had been scoured bare and smooth on one side to cast."
