Detect good was a divination spell that provided information about objects or creatures with a good aura. Some versions of this spell were reversible, becoming detect evil, and operated in the same manner but for evil auras instead.
This spell functioned exactly like detect evil except it detected good auras from paladins, good clerics, spells, magic items, etc. Just as poison did not show up as evil, beneficial potions did not register as good.
The arcane version of the detect evil/detect good spell was invented by Netherese arcanist Trebbe in  under the name Trebbes scry evil/Trebbes scry good.Only the primary form is named in the source. The name of the reversed form, Trebbes scry good, is chosen in analogy.
