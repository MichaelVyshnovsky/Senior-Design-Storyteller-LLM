        "mainbody": "Greater shout was an evocation spell that allowed a caster to shout devastatingly.\nOn casting greater shout, the caster gave a shout that deafened and stunned those within a 60 ft (18 m) cone of the caster. This shout was such that it physically harmed people within its path. It was much more effective at destroying brittle objects or crystalline creatures. It was overall a more effective version of the shout spell.\nShout required only verbal components and an arcane focus in the form of small metal or ivory horn."
