        "mainbody": "'''''Greater shout''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that allowed a caster to shout devastatingly.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''greater shout'', the caster gave a shout that deafened and stunned those within a 60 ft (18 m) cone of the caster. This shout was such that it physically harmed people within its path. It was much more effective at destroying brittle objects or crystalline creatures. It was overall a more effective version of the ''[[shout]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "''Shout'' required only [[verbal component]]s and an [[spell focus|arcane focus]] in the form of small metal or [[ivory]] horn."
