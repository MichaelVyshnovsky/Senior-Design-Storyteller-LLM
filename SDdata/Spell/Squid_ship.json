        "mainbody": "Squid ships, formally cephalopod-class brigs, were squid-shaped spelljammers. Because of their simple design, ease of use and maneuverability, they were very popular vessels among traders and explorers.\nSquid ships merged elements of seafaring sailing ships with the elegant and functional design of nautiloids. Their simple design allowed squid ships to be operated by a relatively small crew. When employed for trading purposes, squid ships typically held a minimum complement of 12 individuals. When in space, the ship could support a maximum complement of 45 individuals without compromising its air supply.\nOn a typical squid ship manned by a human crew, the bridge and captains post was located in the aftcastle, with the spelljamming helm hidden underneath. Communication between the captain and helmsman was attained via speaking tubes.\nSquid ships were primarily employed for trading and adventuring purposes, although their powerful ram and maneuverability also made them favored by pirates and military navies.\nIt was rumored that squid ships were originally designed by humans who had escaped slavery by mind flayers. This was due to their combination of human and illithid designs.\nthumb|300px|The Morkoth, a sea-bound squid ship.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the Morkoth, a sea-bound squid ship, was employed by the Kraken Society as a prison for king Hekaton.\nAround the same time, the Scavenger, a large  squid ship, was captured by Halaster Blackcloak while orbiting Toril and trapped in Undermountain. Halaster stole the ships helm and left the crew marooned within the dungeon."
