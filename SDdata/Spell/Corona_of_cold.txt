Corona of cold was a divine magic spell available to priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It surrounded the caster with an aura of cold that protected the caster from heat and fire, and chilled others within the area.
This spell created an intangible sphere with a 10 ft (3.1 m) radius, centered on the caster, that absorbed some heat and fire damage before it reached the caster. This protection lasted for more than half a minute or until it was dismissed, whichever came first. Higher level casters could extend the duration of the spell and achieve incrementally greater damage absorption.
Creatures other than the caster inside the spherical volume were subjected to chilling temperatures that made them shiver, sapping their strength and making it more difficult to perform tasks requiring dexterity. With sufficient fortitude, they could resist the freezing cold and reduce the time it took to recover, but once they started shivering, it was uncontrollable as long as they remained inside the globe of cold. If an unfortunate creature were inside overlapping coronas of cold, they would have to try to resist each spell, but the chilling effects of multiple coronas was not cumulative.
This spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of the casters holy symbol or divine focus.
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.
