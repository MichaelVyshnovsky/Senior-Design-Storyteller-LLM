}}'''''Sand tools''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was primarily used by [[mechanician]]s.

==Effects==
Mechanicians developed this spell so they would always have access to their special tools. This spell created a standard array of tools that sized themselves perfectly for the task at hand. The tools were formed from [[sand]] but had the strength and hardness of [[iron]].

This spell could last for up to 8 hours, but the tools would revert back to regular sand if the job was finished before that time expired. Sand tools could not be carried with the caster.

==Components==
This spell required a bagful of sand to cast.
