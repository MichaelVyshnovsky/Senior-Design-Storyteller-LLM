'''''Elminster's effulgent epuration''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that created a number of floating spheres that protected an individual from targeted hostile magic.

==Effects==
This spell had a few distinct variations, but all versions produced intangible spheres that floated about the caster or another creature as chosen by the caster, and did not require concentration to maintain. The number of spheres produced was equal to the caster's level. The spheres were about the size of the caster's head, typically {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}} in diameter, and transparent with a silvery hue. They were insubstantial and could not be physically attacked, although one version of the ''epuration'' had spheres that could not pass through solid objects or magical forces such as ''[[forcecage]]'', while other versions were completely unaffected by physical barriers or magical ''walls''.

The spheres could be moved by the mental direction of the caster up to the range of the spell, which varied widely between versions&mdash;anywhere from a ''minimum''  of {{SI|60|ft}} to a ''maximum'' of {{SI|180|ft}} &mdash; either independently or as a group, depending on the version. Once out of range, the spheres hovered in place until they absorbed a spell, or until the spell expired.

Whenever an offensive spell or spell-like ability targeted the creature being protected by the ''epuration'', one sphere would disappear, taking the spell's energy with it. However, one version of ''epuration'' expended a sphere for every level of the spell or effect that was absorbed. Spell effects that covered an area (such as a ''[[fireball]]'') that included a silver sphere were also absorbed, but spells that were already in effect (such as ''[[darkness, 15' radius]]'') when a sphere entered the area were not negated. Most abjuration spells and spells that did not target or immediately harm the caster, such as ''walls'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', or the various ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' spells, were not affected by the ''epuration''. One version allowed the subject of the spell to choose which effects to negate, but this required some amount of concentration.{{Speculation}}

For some versions of this spell, a sufficiently powerful ''[[dispel magic]]'' or an ''[[antimagic field]]'' could cancel the ''epuration'', but other versions claimed that only spells and spell-like effects from [[deity|god-like]] beings could overcome the protection of the spheres.

==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.

==History==
A spell very similar to ''Elminster's effulgent epuration'' was known to the [[sun elves]] of the ancient realm of [[Siluvanede]], between {{Yearlink|-8400}} and {{Yearlink|-4300}}. They used it in the creation of the ''[[Golden orb of Siluvanede|golden orbs of Siluvanede]]''.

This spell was found in a book that was known as "[[Elminster's traveling spellbook]]" although the Old Sage was not known to have claimed responsibility for the book or its peculiar habits. ''Elminster's effulgent epuration'' was later published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community although it was rare to find it.
