        "mainbody": "'''''Knot''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was similar to the ''[[tie]]'' cantrip but formed a knot that was difficult to untangle.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip could be applied to the same material as ''tie'' ([[cable]], [[rope]], twine, string, ''etc.'') and caused it to form a knot that typically took a few minutes to undo without cutting or otherwise damaging the target. Dexterous individuals generally could untie one of these knots a bit quicker. The target rope-like material had to have some slack and/or a loose end, so this cantrip was ineffective on the string of a [[bow]], for example. It also could not affect [[magic item]]s or even ropes being held by another person or creature. However, ''knot'' could be applied after ''tie'' to turn an existing knot into a problem knot.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. An arm was thrust forward with a big twist of the wrist while making a ''zzzz'' sound."
