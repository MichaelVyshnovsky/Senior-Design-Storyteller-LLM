        "mainbody": "Knot was a reversed cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It was similar to the tie cantrip but formed a knot that was difficult to untangle.\nThis cantrip could be applied to the same material as tie (cable, rope, twine, string, etc.) and caused it to form a knot that typically took a few minutes to undo without cutting or otherwise damaging the target. Dexterous individuals generally could untie one of these knots a bit quicker. The target rope-like material had to have some slack and/or a loose end, so this cantrip was ineffective on the string of a bow, for example. It also could not affect magic items or even ropes being held by another person or creature. However, knot could be applied after tie to turn an existing knot into a problem knot.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. An arm was thrust forward with a big twist of the wrist while making a zzzz sound."
