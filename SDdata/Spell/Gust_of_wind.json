        "mainbody": "'''''Gust of wind''''' was an [[evocation]] or [[alteration]] spell that produced a strong wind capable of knocking over or even blowing away small creatures.",
        "Effects": "The caster produced a powerful gale from their person, with a wind speed of around {{SI|50|miles|k|long=yes}} per hour and running in a narrow line directed where they faced. It instantly blew out unprotected flames like candles and torches, and caused even protected flames like lanterns to flicker wildly, and potentially even extinguish them too. Like any natural sudden wind gust, a ''gust of wind'' could also whip up a stinging spray of [[sand]] or dust; fan a large fire; blow over light awnings and hangings; cause a small boat to heel; or disperse gases, clouds, or vapors, at least to the limit of its range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} The wind interfered with thrown and projectile weapons.\n\nCreatures caught in the area might also be affected. First, it was harder to hear over the wind. [[Human]]-sized creatures couldn't move forward against the wind, and those flying were blown back up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. [[Gnome]]-sized creatures were knocked to the ground, and those flying blown back up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. Smaller creatures were knocked over and rolled across the ground up to {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}, battering them in the process, while those flying were blown back up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}, buffeting and battering them. In any case, the wind could not blow a creature beyond its range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nIt only lasted several seconds, but could be made permanent with ''[[permanency]]''.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a legume seed.",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Tolodine]] as '''''Tolodine's gust of wind''''' in {{Yearlink|-2386}}, early in the history of [[Netheril]].",
        "Uses": "Shipboard mages, such as those on the ''[[Sea Quest]]'', used ''gust of wind'' at the sails to increase speed."
