Deny death was a divine magic spell available to priests of Kelemvor.
When cast, the spell placed an injured individual into form of suspended animation. This prevented any further loss of blood or vital fluids, and also prevented any poisons or toxins from spreading further in the body.
The individual had to be willing. The spell did not function on a hostile target who was still conscience. It also had no effect on an individual who was under the effects of charm or sleep, both magical and psionic.
Once under the influence of the spell, the individual did not receive any harm from nonmagical attacks. This allowed the grievously wounded individual to be transported quickly over rough terrain without their condition deteriorating further.
Only the caster could terminate the effects of the spell. The en-spelled individual could not wake up on their own or be roused by another individual. 
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
