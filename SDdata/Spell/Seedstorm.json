        "mainbody": "Seedstorm was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priestesses devoted to Isis called Skyweavers.\nThis spell caused an explosion of seeds from the center of the area of effect. Though used primarily during planting season, seedstorm also served as an effect combat spell since any living thing caught within the area of effect was showered by the small quick-moving seeds and harmed. The caster was never harmed by the seeds.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priestesses holy symbol and a handful of the appropriate seeds to cast."
