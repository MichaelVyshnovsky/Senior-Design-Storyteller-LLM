        "mainbody": "'''''Seedstorm''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priestesses devoted to [[Isis]] called [[Skyweaver]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused an explosion of seeds from the center of the area of effect. Though used primarily during planting season, ''seedstorm'' also served as an effect combat spell since any living thing caught within the area of effect was showered by the small quick-moving seeds and harmed. The caster was never harmed by the seeds.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the priestesses [[holy symbol]] and a handful of the appropriate seeds to cast."
