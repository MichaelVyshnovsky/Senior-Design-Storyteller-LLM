It was difficult to maintain ones balance if attempting to engage in combat while levitating. 
The effects of this spell lasted for several minutes, depending on the power of the caster.

The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Yturn in  and was originally called Yturns levitation.
Some races native to Faer√ªn, such as the air genasi and the drow (while in the Underdark), had the innate ability to levitate.
