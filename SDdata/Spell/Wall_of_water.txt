'''''Wall of water''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a barrier made of water.

==Effects==
The spell conjured a wall of water within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} that could either be straight, with a maximum length of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, or a circular ring of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. In either case, the wall was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} thick. The effect lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. When the spell ended, the water disappeared.

The wall itself did not prevent movement, but made it slightly difficult for creatures to cross through. It rendered ranged attacks particularly difficult through the barrier. [[Fire]] effects crossing the wall were only half as effective as normal, and cold effects caused the portion of the wall they crossed to freeze solid. Freezing the wall produced the curious effect of making it possible to break through the ice. The water did not fill a broken section of frozen wall.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a drop of water.
