Darkbolt was a divine evocation spell unique to clerics with the Darkness domain. It fired bolts of darkness that damaged and dazed the target. An arcane spell with the same name was used by wizards and alhoons.
From their open palm, the caster could hurl beams of darkness at their foes. The number of bolts the cleric could launch increased with their power, though only a maximum of seven bolts could be thrown. They could launch them all at once (if targets were no more than 60 feet (18 meters) apart) or one or a few at time, but a bolt would be lost if not used within several seconds. A darkbolt dealt a moderate amount of damage to a living creature, and the creature was dazed for several seconds if they could not resist. Undead were unharmed by the spell, but could be dazed.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components were required.
This spell launched an eel-like black tentacle from both of the casters hands. The tentacles were able to attack a single or multiple targets. As it came into contact with a targeted creature, the tentacle constricted, inflicting damage and terrible pain, until the spell expired. If a tentacle missed its target, it returned to the caster and was launched once more. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, an appendage that resembled a tentacle, such as a strand from a roper or a pseudo-pod from a mimic. Also acceptable as a material component was either a piece or the whole body of a snake or worm, or a tentacles from an octopus or squid.
