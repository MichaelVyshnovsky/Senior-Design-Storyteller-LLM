'''''Darkbolt''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] spell unique to [[cleric]]s with the [[Darkness domain]]. It fired bolts of darkness that damaged and dazed the target. An [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spell with the same name was used by [[wizard]]s and [[alhoon]]s.

==Divine==
===Effects===
From their open palm, the caster could hurl beams of darkness at their foes. The number of bolts the cleric could launch increased with their power, though only a maximum of seven bolts could be thrown. They could launch them all at once (if targets were no more than 60 feet (18 meters) apart) or one or a few at time, but a bolt would be lost if not used within several seconds. A ''darkbolt'' dealt a moderate amount of damage to a living creature, and the creature was dazed for several seconds if they could not resist. [[Undead]] were unharmed by the spell, but could be dazed.

===Components===
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required.

==Arcane==
===Effects===
This spell launched an eel-like black tentacle from both of the caster's hands. The tentacles were able to attack a single or multiple targets. As it came into contact with a targeted creature, the tentacle constricted, inflicting damage and terrible pain, until the spell expired. If a tentacle missed its target, it returned to the caster and was launched once more. 

===Components===
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], an appendage that resembled a tentacle, such as a strand from a [[roper]] or a pseudo-pod from a [[mimic]]. Also acceptable as a material component was either a piece or the whole body of a snake or worm, or a tentacles from an octopus or squid.
