        "mainbody": "'''''Dream''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that would shape the dreams of a target. and the [[elven]] goddess [[Sehanine Moonbow]].",
        "Effect": "Choosing a known target within the same plane and casting the ''dream'' spell allowed the caster or someone else to become a messenger and effect the chosen's dreams. If the target was asleep, the messenger could effect the target's dream, creating anything, and the target would remember the dream perfectly. If the target was awake the messenger would know it and could wait for them to fall asleep or end the trance ahead of time. If the target could not sleep, then the spell had no effect. If the messenger chose to look horrific, its message would be shortened and the target would attempt to resist the messenger.\n\nIf the target resisted the messenger, the target wouldn't be able to fully rest and would have nightmares and when they woke they took psychic damage.\n\nIf the caster had something from the body of the target, like hair or nails, then the target would be disadvantaged against the spell.",
        "Components": "In order to cast this spell, the caster needed [[Verbal component|vocal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird, a dab of [[ink]], and a handful of sand as [[material component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was credited to the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Efteran]] in {{Yearlink|-1769}} and was originally called ''Efteran's dream''."
