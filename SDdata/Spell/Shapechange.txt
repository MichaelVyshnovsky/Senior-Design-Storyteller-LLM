Shapechange (also shape change) was a transmutation spell. 
A powerful variant of the polymorph family, it changed the users shape into any creature, and allowed him/her to change frequently.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas change shape.
During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright. However, the spell did not last long, and she quickly reverted to human form.
