        "mainbody": "'''''Ecdysis''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[animal sphere]] that rapidly accelerated a [[dragon]]'s molting process.<ref name=CotD-p124\">",
        "Effects": "This spell was only effective against living dragons, [[dragonet]]s, [[dragon turtle]]s, [[dracohydra]]e, and draconic hybrids. A target affected by ''ecdysis'' began to rapidly shed their scales, becoming more vulnerable with each passing minute. The shed scales turned to dust quickly so could not be gathered for spellcasting purposes. The spell's effects could be stopped, but not reversed, by ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[cure disease]]''. The dragon's recovery could be accelerated by ''[[heal]]'', ''[[wish]]'', and ''[[limited wish]]'', otherwise the dragon would regrow their scales naturally at a rate of ten percent per day.<ref name=CotD-p124\"/>",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] and a scale from any reptile to cast.<ref name=CotD-p124\"/>",
        "History": "This spell was only granted to dragons by [[Null]], the Death Wyrm.<ref name=CotD-p124\"/>"
