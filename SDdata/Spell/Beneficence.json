        "mainbody": "'''''Beneficence''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell surrounded the shugenja with an aura of harmony and wisdom. This caused the shugenja to appear as a person of virtue to others, and was thus treated with respect. This effect did not deprive a creature of their free will, nor would they blindly worship the shugenja. The spell had no effect on evil creatures, or enemies of the shugenja. It also had no effect on a creature who had no knowledge of what a shugenja was. So a creature from [[Faer√ªn]] who was not knowledgeable in the culture of Kara-Tur, would not be affected by this spell.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] components."
