'''''Scattergloom''''' was a spell used to cover an area with shadow. 

==Effects==
When cast, four large cylindrical columns of ''[[darkness]]'', called glooms, were created. Each column was {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in width and {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall. The columns of ''darkness'' roamed an area with a {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} radius around the caster, moving in rapid and random motions. The caster had limited control over the columns' movement.  

==Components==
This spell required only a [[verbal component]].

==History==
Many centuries ago, an evil [[steel dragon]], who avoided [[human]]s and took the form of a [[necromancer]], created this spell.
