Scattergloom was a spell used to cover an area with shadow. 
When cast, four large cylindrical columns of darkness, called glooms, were created. Each column was  in width and  tall. The columns of darkness roamed an area with a  radius around the caster, moving in rapid and random motions. The caster had limited control over the columns movement.  
This spell required only a verbal component.
Many centuries ago, an evil steel dragon, who avoided humans and took the form of a necromancer, created this spell.
