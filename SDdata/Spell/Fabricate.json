The size changed with every type of [[Weave]], the Oldest known version had it based on skill to a minimum of a 1 yard (0.91M) cube, after that it changed to 10 cubic ft.(3.04M) maximum unless the caster was more skilled.After the [[Second Sundering]] it changed to a 10 foot cube or 5-foot (1.52M) cubes.\nOne that that remained was that the size got greatly reduced when using minerals or metals, to as low as a 1 foot cube.\n\nThis spell could have used to make wood or trees in to a bridge or wool in to cloths. If the caster wished to make more advanced items the caster needed to have the skills to make the intended item by hand.",
