Fireball was an arcane spell that created a tiny ball of fire that, when thrown, exploded in a huge fireball. While a very potent spell, casters had to take care to avoid catching allies in the explosion, or to accidentally strike an obstruction and detonate the spell early.
Before the Spellplague, fireball at its weakest had a range of over 400 ft (120 m),, but after the collapse of the Weave its range was greatly reduced, only reaching 100 ft (30 m). After the Second Sundering, the spells range was 150 ft (46 m).
If cast in space, the spell itself could pass through the void, but the fireball could only be detonated inside an atmosphere. If cast in the phlogiston, the spell immediately detonated at the casters position. Fireball was capable of dealing damage to spelljammers.
In the Raumviran spellcasting tradition, the verbal component was the word Kelenta.
Many versions had verbal and somatic components but also the need for a tiny amount of bat guano or sulphur. However, most wizards, upon learning how to cast fireball would spend at least a tenday modifying the spell to make it easier to cast quickly.
This spell was developed by the Fire Warden of Netheril Noanar and was named Noanars fireball in , two years after its more powerful companion delayed blast fireball. It was the arcanists last invention, three years before his death at the hands of his long-time enemies and victims, the Canlespiere ogres.
Around , Olostin, the low Netherese Baron of Dread, and his company were incinerated by a Noanars fireball cast at extremely high level by an unknown arcanist, ending his reign of terror. 
During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, the wizard Dwalimar Omen attempted to cast the spell, but only managed to produce flowers.
In Waterdeep in 1358 DR, Kyriani placed a fireball spell in a ring of spell storing, which Onyx the Invincible used to surprise the marauding Aviss and Fellandar, though they emerged smoking from the flames.
There existed a variation of the fireball spell called orb of black death. The difference between the two spells is that the orb of black death was imbued with necrotic energy rather than fire and flame.
