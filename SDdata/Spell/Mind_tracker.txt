'''''Mind tracker''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] from the [[divination sphere]] that created an [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] creature that would hunt specific quarry.

==Effects==
A ''mind tracker'' needed to be assigned a quarry within one hour of being created or the spell was wasted. The caster needed to have a line of sight upon the quarry when selecting them. The ''mind tracker'' would then be mentally tethered to the target, following the target and relaying any information back to the caster. The ''mind tracker'' would remain in existence tracking its target for as long as the caster remained conscious or awake.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[lizard]]'s brain and a whisp of the [[Ethereal plane]]'s atmosphere to cast.

==History==
[[Mazewalker]]s, [[specialty priest]]s of [[Ubtao]], could cast the ''mind tracker'' spell.
