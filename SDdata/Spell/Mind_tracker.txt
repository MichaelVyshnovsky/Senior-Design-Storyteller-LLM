Mind tracker was a divine divination spell from the divination sphere that created an ethereal creature that would hunt specific quarry.
A mind tracker needed to be assigned a quarry within one hour of being created or the spell was wasted. The caster needed to have a line of sight upon the quarry when selecting them. The mind tracker would then be mentally tethered to the target, following the target and relaying any information back to the caster. The mind tracker would remain in existence tracking its target for as long as the caster remained conscious or awake.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a lizards brain and a whisp of the Ethereal planes atmosphere to cast.
Mazewalkers, specialty priests of Ubtao, could cast the mind tracker spell.
