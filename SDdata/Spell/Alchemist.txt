An '''alchemist''' was a craft profession.  At the most basic level, anyone who mixed substances together in a liquid form to create a wanted effect could be considered an alchemist. Alchemy required a fair amount of intelligence, as well as time and materials.  It could also be a very expensive pursuit. 

An alchemist could craft mundane substances, such as [[oil]], [[soap]], [[perfume]], [[antitoxin]], [[acid]], [[alchemist's fire]], [[sunrod]]s, [[tanglefoot bag]]s, and [[Thunderstone (item)|thunderstones]], and other things such as the special brews that were used in the process of creating a [[dracolich]]. In the days of ancient [[Netheril]], an entire school was dedicated to the study of alchemy. Scholars there were able to turn lead into [[gold]], turn air into poisonous gas, make water explosive, and shape [[elemental fire]].

Not all alchemists were [[mage|spellcasters]], but many were, as spellcasting ability was needed to make magical potions. Dedicated practitioners could become [[master alchemist]]s.

Of all the races, [[gnomes]] were best known across the [[Faerûn|Realms]] as alchemists.


==Alchemical Supplies==
In addition to a clear space and workbench, a fully-stocked alchemical laboratory required many tools and implements, costing on average between 200-1000 [[gp]].

The preparation of substances used tools like the common [[measuring cup]] and [[measuring spoon|spoon]], [[mortar and pestle]], or [[quern]]. and separation of materials could be done with a [[centrifuge]], on a [[funnel]]. A [[file]] was useful for taking small slivers off a solid chunk of material.

For storing supplies and finished products, alchemists used containers like [[bottle]]s, [[flask]]s, [[jug]]s, and [[vial]]s Preservation of non-stable ingredients could be helped with a cold [[ice chest]] filled with blocks of ice.

Timekeeping for processes could be tracked with a [[Hourglass|minute or hourglass]] or large [[water clock]]. When taking quick notes, an alchemist could use an [[easel]], [[drawing slate]] and [[chalk]], or a handy [[papyrus pad]]. The examination of their work could require the use of various [[lens]], concave and convex, to get a clearer view.

When actively mixing and heating they used [[dish]]es,{{Cite dragon/117/Dungeoneer's Shopping Guide|22}} [[retort]]s, [[crucible]]s, while simple [[string]] had any number of uses holding things together.

For heating, some sort of fireplace or [[furnace]] was needed, with [[coal]] serving as an ideal fuel. The [[brazier]] was a common choice, while [[candle]]s were used for smaller applications. [[Oven]]s and [[kiln]]s provided large-scale, steady and high temperatures, making them a vital but bulky addition to a workspace. [[Bellows]] fed air into the flame to intensify the heat, while a [[vent]] could be used to safely evacuate dangerous gases from a chamber.

For handling their work, hazardous or otherwise, an alchemist was advised to use [[tongs]], [[tweezers]], [[heat mat]]s, and [[magnet]]s depending on the situation. They could also wear sturdy [[gloves]] and an [[apron]] to protect themselves further. Cleaning up could be made far easier with [[sponge]]s, a washing [[basin]] and a [[water reservoir]].
