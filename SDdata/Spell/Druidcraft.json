        "mainbody": "Druidcraft was a transmutation cantrip spell that allowed the caster to commune with spirits to cause minor effects.\nThe spell could have one of four effects chosen by the caster\n* Make a minor prediction of the weather within the area for the next 24 hours. The prediction would show, for example, a golden orb for clear sunny skies that would last for a couple of seconds.\n* Make a flower instantly go into bloom, a leaf bud bloom, or a seed pod open.\n* Instantly create a sensory effect, like falling leaves, the sound of an animal, the odor of a skunk, or a puff of wind. The effect only existed within a 5-foot-wide cube (1.5 meters).\n* Light or extinguish a small flame like a candle or small campfire instantly.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were needed for the casting of the spell."
