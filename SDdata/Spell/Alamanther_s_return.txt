}}'''''Alamanther’s return''''' was a very rare and powerful [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This powerful spell allowed a caster to duplicate any spell they had witnessed being cast. It could be used to duplicate nearly every spell both arcane and divine. This spell achieved this by functioning similar to a ''[[wish]]'' spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a mirror made from [[silver]] with a value of at least 50 [[gp]].
