Alamantherâ€™s return was a very rare and powerful spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
This powerful spell allowed a caster to duplicate any spell they had witnessed being cast. It could be used to duplicate nearly every spell both arcane and divine. This spell achieved this by functioning similar to a wish spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a mirror made from silver with a value of at least 50 gp.
