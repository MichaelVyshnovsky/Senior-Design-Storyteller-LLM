Venomous blade was a spell used by clerics of Selvetarm.
This spell temporarily envenomed a single-bladed melee weapon. The weapon delivered venom with the first three strikes into a target. The wielder had to use the weapon within a day or else the effects of the spell expired. Like a sword of wounding, wounds caused by this spell could not be magically healed. Only a wish spell could heal injuries from this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a thick paste made from venom and other noxious ingredients that was rubbed onto the blade.
