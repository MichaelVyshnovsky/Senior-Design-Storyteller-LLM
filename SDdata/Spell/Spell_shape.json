        "mainbody": "'''''Spell shape''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used exclusively by [[wild mage]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a wild mage to snatch spell energy, or effects from [[magic item]]s such as wands, directed at them and reshape it as they desired. Once the caster absorbed the incoming spell energy they could either let it dissipate harmlessly, or instantly direct it back to their attacker with a spell casting. The caster could choose to direct the spell energy to the attacker in the form of any spell they currently had memorized provided the spell was not more powerful than the spell originally directed at them. This act would not remove that spell from the caster's memory. The spell energy could not be saved in any manner. It would dissipate if not used immediately.\n\nA wild mage struck with two or more spells at the same time could choose which spell they wanted to shape, allowing the remaining incoming spells to strike them as normal.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[diamond]] worth at least 2,000 [[gp]] to cast. Casting the spell turned the diamond into a lump of coal."
