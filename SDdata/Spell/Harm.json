Some versions also inflicted a disease on the victim. The reverse of this spell, '''''[[heal]]''''', cured most ailments and greatly restored lost health.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to touch the recipient of this spell for it to work. The newer version of this spell had a limit on how much health damage it could deliver, but neither version could completely kill a victim or even knock it unconscious. The older version added insult to injury by giving the victim a disease.\n\nIf cast in reverse, ''heal'' brought a living creature back to full health and cured all disease and nearly all other ailments.\n\nIf either version was successfully cast on an [[undead]] creature, it acted like the corresponding ''[[heal]]'' spell."
