Rune of power was a divine abjuration and evocation spell from the guardian sphere that created powerful magical inscriptions.
The power of this spell was related to the skill of the caster. The triggers for each rune, or outlining things that would not trigger the rune, was set by the caster during the casting. A rune of power could be drawn to any size larger than the casters hand. Most runes of power duplicated the harmful effects of various wizard spells. Some examples are listed below
* Alhalbrin melted metal on contact or that passed the rune.
* Faerindyl created a ricocheting flaming sphere. 
* Sabras created a blade barrier.
* Thundaril polymorphed the creature that activated the rune.
* Velurndyn created a reverse gravity field.
Some runes of power took immediate effect upon being placed. Some examples are listed below
* Bhelaerak acted like glassteel.
* Corsimmyr acted like passwall.
* Delhaubrin acted like shatter.
* Elemsyr acted like invisibility for a single creature or object.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the casting priests holy symbol to cast. The holy symbol was used to trace the rune.
Runes of power used to be able to be used by all dwarves on Toril with varying degrees of power and success based upon their training and skill. An incredibly powerful rune of power once destroyed the city of Dharrmaghongh in Murgh√¥m.
