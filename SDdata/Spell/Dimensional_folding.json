        "mainbody": "Dimensional folding was a divine alteration spell from the numbers sphere that allowed the caster to warp the fabric of space.\nThis spell folded the space around the caster, allowing for instantaneous travel to a selected location within range by stepping through a created gateway. This spell was best used only if the casting priest was familiar with the selected destination, otherwise the act of stepping through folded space had a chance to age the caster, and anyone traveling with them, by several years.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a sheet of platinum worth at least 15 gp to cast. The sheet was intricately folded and consumed during the casting.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the dimensional folding spell."
