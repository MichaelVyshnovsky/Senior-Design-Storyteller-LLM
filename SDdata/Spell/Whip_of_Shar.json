        "mainbody": "'''''Whip of Shar''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] spell granted to [[priest]]s of [[Shar]], Mistress of the Night. It created a [[whip]] of force that could cause injury, wracking pain, and even [[Turn undead|turn]] [[undead]] creatures.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a beam of black energy surrounded by a purple nimbus that flickered and writhed. It was {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}, {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} in diameter, and flexible like a whip or rope. The ''whip'' only affected animate creatures and undeadâ€”it had no affect on inanimate objects and no strength to move, loop, tie, bind, constrict, or entangle anything. It connected to and extended from the caster's hand and could not harm the caster.\n\nWhen the ''whip'' struck a creature, it did damage much like a mundane whip. In addition, if the target did not resist the magic of the spell, they were wracked with excruciating pain for one minute, unable to attack, and subject to dropping things they were holding. Each successive hit with the ''whip'' on the same target became increasingly easier to resist as they slowly became numb to the pain. If the target was an undead creature, it experienced a ''turn'' effect as if by a priest of much greater experience than the ''whip''-wielder.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast, plus [[material component]]s that consisted of three sharp pieces of black [[obsidian]] or black glass, and a long, black hair obtained from an [[evil]] creature.",
        "History": "This spell was available to devout followers of Shar at least as far back as ancient [[Netheril]]. The Sage of Shadowdale, [[Elminster Aumar]], speculated that priests of other deities, such as [[Cyric]], [[Loviatar]], [[Talona]], and the [[Dead Three]] could be granted this spell if they knew how to properly ask their deity for it."
