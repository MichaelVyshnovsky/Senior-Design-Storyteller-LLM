The dance of life could only be successfully cast within a smaller community were the vast majority of female inhabitants participated. It could also only be cast once per year for a given community. Participants danced wildly within a ring for one hour at then collapsed. Infirm members of the community could also dance as they were filled with Hathors vigor.\nAnyone participating in the dance was cured of any natural diseases, poisons, and minor wounds. When the dance concluded all participants experienced a feeling of complete rest and nourishment. Furthermore, natural disease within the entire community was cleansed.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a few gallons of milk to cast. The milk was spilled on the ground prior to dancing."
