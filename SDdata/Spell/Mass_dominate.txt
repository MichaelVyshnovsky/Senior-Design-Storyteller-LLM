Mass dominate was a more powerful version of the dominate monster spell used by wizards, sorcerers, bards, and the Dreadmasters of Bane.
When the spell was cast, it affected all creatures within an area the caster could see of  in radius. All creatures who failed to retain their will were dominated by the caster. The domination lasted for fifty-four seconds and even longer if cast by a person of epic powers. Undead creatures were unaffected by the spell.
