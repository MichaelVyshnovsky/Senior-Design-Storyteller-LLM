        "mainbody": "Wandering symbol was a multi-school spell that created two symbols that would randomly wander along a pre-determined set of surfaces.\nThe symbols created by this spell had the same properties as those conjured by the 8th level arcane spell of a similar name. The major difference being these were capable of random movement.\nWhile casting wandering symbol, the wizard would touch, and hence designate, between two to nine different surfaces within a two-mile radius of one another. When the casting was finished, and the caster created their symbols, they would be capable of travel along these surface types, taking completely random pathways.\nThis spell required a set of material components, one for each surface that was designated for the symbols these included a potion of sweet water and the powder of crushed, translucent gem stones and crushed black opal, each of which had to be worth more than 1000 gp."
