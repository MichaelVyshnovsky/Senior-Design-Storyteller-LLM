        "mainbody": "'''''Wandering symbol''''' was a multi-[[magic|school]] [[spell]] that created two ''[[symbol]]s'' that would randomly wander along a pre-determined set of surfaces.",
        "Effects": "The ''symbols'' created by this spell had the same properties as those conjured by the 8th level [[arcane]] spell of a similar name. The major difference being these were capable of random movement.",
        "Casting": "While casting ''wandering symbol'', the [[wizard]] would touch, and hence designate, between two to nine different surfaces within a two-mile radius of one another. When the casting was finished, and the caster created their ''symbols'', they would be capable of travel along these surface types, taking completely random pathways.",
        "Components": "This spell required a set of material components, one for each surface that was designated for the ''symbols''; these included a ''[[potion of sweet water]]'' and the powder of crushed, translucent [[gem stones]] and crushed [[black opal]], each of which had to be worth more than 1000 [[gp]]."
