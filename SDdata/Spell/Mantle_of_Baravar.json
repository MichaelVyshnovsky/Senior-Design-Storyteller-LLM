        "mainbody": "Mantle of Baravar was a spell used by clerics of Baravar Cloakshadow.\nWhen cast, this spell granted a magical resistance to illusion and phantasm-based spells. The caster was capable of bestowing this magical resistance evenly to multiple recipients. The strength of the magical resistance was determined by the casters skill level. The duration of the spell varied based on how many individuals the spell was cast on, with a maximum of ten hours for one individual. This spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Baravar Cloakshadow."
