'''''Message mote''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to manifest a cluster of twinkling lights and short message, both of which appeared under certain specified circumstances.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the cleric specified a number of conditions that would then activate the ''mote'', along with a location at which it would rest. While in its dormant state, the ''mote'' could not be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' or ''[[Detect magic|detected]]''.

Once the caster's conditions were met, the ''message mote'' appeared as a cloud of twinkling light no more than {{SI|1|cu. ft}} in volume. Based on the caster's specifications the ''mote'' appeared in different hues, intensities and shapes, even moving a limited distance or forming simple shapes. If the caster chose, the ''mote'' "spoke" a short message in the voice they used while uttering the spell's [[verbal component]].

==History==
This spell was inscribed in one of the [[scroll]]s that were contained within the ''[[Balance of Belaros]]''.

==Casting==
In addition to the spell's verbal component, ''message mote'' required a [[somatic component]].
