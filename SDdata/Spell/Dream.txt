Dream was an illusion spell that would shape the dreams of a target. and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.
Choosing a known target within the same plane and casting the dream spell allowed the caster or someone else to become a messenger and effect the chosens dreams. If the target was asleep, the messenger could effect the targets dream, creating anything, and the target would remember the dream perfectly. If the target was awake the messenger would know it and could wait for them to fall asleep or end the trance ahead of time. If the target could not sleep, then the spell had no effect. If the messenger chose to look horrific, its message would be shortened and the target would attempt to resist the messenger.
If the target resisted the messenger, the target wouldnt be able to fully rest and would have nightmares and when they woke they took psychic damage.
If the caster had something from the body of the target, like hair or nails, then the target would be disadvantaged against the spell.
In order to cast this spell, the caster needed vocal and somatic components as well as a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird, a dab of ink, and a handful of sand as material components.
The spell was credited to the Netherese arcanist Efteran in  and was originally called Efterans dream.
