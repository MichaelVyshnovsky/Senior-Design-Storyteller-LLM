Easy trail was an abjuration spell used by travelers of the wilderness in the Forgotten Realms. It created a path for the caster and any followers behind him by magically forcing aside any underbrush gently.
The spell created a field of energy that effected natural plants but not plant creatures. Those traveling in the area of the effect could move as easily as if they were passing along a trail.
An additional benefit to the use of the spell was that it effectively covered tracks automatically, as plants would return to their former places once the spellcaster passed 30 feet (nine meters) beyond, hiding any signs of passage.
Once cast, the spell would last at least a couple hours, depending on the power of the caster.
This spell required both verbal and somatic components.
