Athelzedars rest was a powerful arcane spell that cloaked the caster from all manner of seeking.
The ward employed layers of misdirection and nullification to hide a wizard from all seeking.
The caster could also employ his own energies to boost its duration, or those of a different wizard.
The Magister Imrul Athelzedar perfected this spell over five summers, starting in . After he was found anyway by Eron Imgrym and attacked, he cast a version of this spell that employed his own energies, and those of his attacker, to cast an even more powerful version of the spell on his apprentice, Noum√©a Drathchuld, before commanding her to kill him and take the mantle of the Magister.
