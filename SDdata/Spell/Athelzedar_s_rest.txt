'''''Athelzedar's rest''''' was a powerful [[arcane]] [[spell]] that cloaked the caster from all manner of seeking.

==Effects==
The ward employed layers of misdirection and nullification to hide a wizard from all seeking.

The caster could also employ his own energies to boost its duration, or those of a different wizard.

==History==
The [[Magister]] [[Imrul Athelzedar]] perfected this spell over five summers, starting in {{yearlink|1347}}. After he was found anyway by [[Eron Imgrym]] and attacked, he cast a version of this spell that employed his own energies, and those of his attacker, to cast an even more powerful version of the spell on his apprentice, [[Noum√©a Drathchuld]], before commanding her to kill him and take the mantle of the Magister.
