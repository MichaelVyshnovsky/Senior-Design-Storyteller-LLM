        "mainbody": "Wind shadow was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell caused the target to assume a nearly weightless, translucent form that was capable of gliding on a breeze. Strong gales slowed any target attempting to move while under the influence of this spell. The target could not speak out loud until the spell ended.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of silk or gossamer to cast."
