        "mainbody": "Free will was a divine enchantment spell used only by shamans devoted to Ubtao called spiritlords.\nThis spell freed the targets mind from any magical charms, enchantments, or psionic intrusions affecting the will of the mind. Spiritlords who prayed for and received this spell, but had yet to cast it could do so immediately in response of an incoming attack on their mind.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
