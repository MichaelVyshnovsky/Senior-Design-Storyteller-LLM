        "mainbody": "'''''Cloak of chaos''''' was a [[divine]] [[abjuration]] spell that granted magical armor and resistance, especially against [[lawful]] creatures and magic.",
        "Effect": "The affected beings—up to fifteen or more within {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} of the caster—were surrounded by random patterns of colors that warded them from harm. These had four distinct benefits. First, those warded were shielded from attacks and bestowed resistance to harmful effects. They were also immune to possession and mental influence. Both applied whether the source was lawful or not.\n\nThey were also warded against spells of a lawful nature and spells cast by lawful beings. In addition, if a lawful attacker successfully struck someone warded by ''cloak of chaos'', the attacker risked being confused for several seconds, similar to the ''[[confusion]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the spell required a [[Spell focus|focus]] in the form of a tiny reliquary worth over 500 [[gp]] holding a sacred relic associated with [[chaos]], like a piece of parchment of a chaotic text."
