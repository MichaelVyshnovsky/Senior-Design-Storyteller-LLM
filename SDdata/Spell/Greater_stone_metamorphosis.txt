'''''Greater stone metamorphosis''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that changed one type of stone into another.

==Effects==
''Greater stone metamorphosis'' was a more complex version of ''[[stone metamorphosis]]'' and worked exactly like that spell with the same limitations. The difference between these two spells was the amount of affected stone. ''Greater stone metamorphosis'' affected massively more of it.

==Components==
''Greater stone metamorphosis'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s to cast. The material components were a grain of talc and a chip of [[obsidian]]. Divine spellcasters had to substitute the material components with a [[divine focus]].

==History==
At latest by [[1372 DR]], a kind of [[magic]]al [[staff]] called a ''[[staff of stone]]'' was developed. The crafting of these staves required among others the casting of a ''greater stone metamorphosis'' spell.
