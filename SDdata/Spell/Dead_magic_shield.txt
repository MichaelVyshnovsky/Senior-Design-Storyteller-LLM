Dead magic shield was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Shaundakul, enabling them to create a shield of force.
This spell created a  diameter shield of force attached to one of the casters forearms. The dead magic shield could be used to block incoming magical attacks if the caster was not wielding a two-handed weapon, casting another spell, or carrying a regular shield. The shield would still function if the priest was wielding a weapon in their other hand.
The dead magic shield would dissipate any incoming magic directed at the caster. The shield had no effect against physical attacks.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
