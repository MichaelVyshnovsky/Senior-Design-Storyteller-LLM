'''''Ice knife''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] or [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that hurled a knife of [[ice]] at a target for moderate damage.

==Effects==
The impact of the evoked knife of ice would cause not only flat damage, but also a wave of cold to creatures within a {{SIAdj|5|ft|long=yes}} radius. The creatures in this area could be damaged, and would also become numb, making it harder to both move and attack. However, if the target was in the presence of a large source of heat, they would have a chance to negate the numbness. The spell caused no damage to [[spelljammer]]s

==Components==
As well as a [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, a droplet of water from melted snow and a small [[silver]] [[dagger]] were used as the [[material component]]s.

===Usage===
This spell was mainly used by [[wu jen]] and others in [[Kara-Tur|eastern]] lands. However, it could also be used by frost or [[water]] mages, although it was uncommon.
