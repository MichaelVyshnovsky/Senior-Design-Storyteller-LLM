        "Effects": "The begin this spell the caster needed to injure themselves with a bladed weapon and leave the weapon in the wound. Wizards used this spell as a last resort when they knew they were going to be attacked. They could still cast other spells while under the effect of the ''swordshun'' spell but their spells took a little bit longer to cast compared to normal.\n\nWith the target weapon in the wound, the caster was immune to all attacks from weapons designed to slice or pierce flesh. This included immunity from spells such as ''[[blade barrier]]''. Wounds caused by these weapons on the caster's body closed instantly without any harm to the caster.\n\nThe spell ended when either the target weapon was removed from the wound or the caster lost consciousness. Any healing magic directed at the caster while the target weapon was in the wound was delayed until the weapon was removed regardless of how much time passed since the healing spell was cast.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s the target weapon to cast. The weapon dissipated into smoke when the spell ended."
