        "mainbody": "Fire breath was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur. \nThe spell enabled a wu jen to breathe a very large cone of magical flame. This cone was 30 feet (9 meters) long and 15 feet (4.5 meters) wide at the base. The powerful flame would instantly ignite any combustible material within the cone.\nIf a wu jen cast this spell in the phlogiston, the wu jen and anyone within a 60 foot (18 meter) by 30 foot (9 meter) area were injured by the magical flame.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component. The wu jen clenched a piece of hot charcoal with their teeth during casting."
