Sleep of dragons was a powerful divine enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Tiamat called Wyrmkeepers.
The target of this spell fell into a deep sleep similar to that of a hibernating dragon after being touched by the caster. While in dragon sleep, the target did not require air, food or water and only aged one year for a century of sleep. The dragon sleep ended when the target was killed, died of old age, or was touched by a fragment of dragon bone. Spells such as dispel magic and remove curse did not affect sleep of dragons. Furthermore, resistances and immunties to common sleep spells provided no defense against this spell. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a thimble of dragon blood to cast.
