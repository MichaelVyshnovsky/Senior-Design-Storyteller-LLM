'''''Wall of moonlight''''' was a divine [[alteration]] or [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a curtain of light that harmed evil creatures and highlighted magical items. It was available only to priests of [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden.

==Users==
After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the spell was available to [[cleric]]s of Selûne.

After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], it was available to clerics, [[druid]]s, and [[ranger]]s initiated into the greatest secrets of the [[church of Selûne|Selûnite church]].

==Effect==
As the name implied, the spell evoked a wall of magical moonlight into existence, appearing like a plane or tapestry of swirling pearly white light. It was some {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} thick and could be at least {{SI|175|ft²|long=yes}} in surface area, more with the caster's skill, less if it was limited by the surroundings or the caster designed it with an opening. It did not need to be anchored to anything, but had to stand upright and could not be moved once created. It had a brief duration, and could not be dismissed early.

Although composed of force, the ''wall of moonlight'' was intangible; anything could contact it or pass through it. However, it had certain effects on creatures and items that did. [[Undead]] creatures were seriously damaged, while [[evil]] beings and anyone carrying a [[holy symbol]] of [[Shar]] or [[Umberlee]] were harmed to a lesser degree. [[Magical item]]s spontaneous glowed red as if with ''[[faerie fire]]'' for a brief period; this could not be removed before it expired. Magical [[potion]]s could even explode; if in glass, crystal, or [[ceramic]] [[flask]]s, they might injure people nearby. If the ''wall of moonlight'' appeared where creatures already stood, they would be affected as if they'd passed through. If they had to pass through multiple times, or halted within it for too long, they could be affected each time.

The shimmering, false moonlight was sufficiently bright for reading and illuminating an area up to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} from it, and dimly beyond that. It could counter ''[[darkness]]'' or any similar spell of up to the same level that appeared within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} of it. Those with [[infravision]] could not see through it clearly, though they might shield their eyes from the glare.

The ''wall of moonlight'' could be made permanent with a ''permanency'' spell by a sufficiently experienced caster.

==Components==
Both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required.

==Notable Uses==
''Walls of moonlight'' were used for defense and construction at the [[House of the Moon]] temple in [[Waterdeep]]. They would appear in an instant if someone tried to fly in and land on the Grand Balcony and the Dome of the Moon was made of multiple ''wall of moonlight'' spells, overlapped and combined with a number of carefully worded ''wish'' spells. While normally any matter could pass through, the high priestess and the goddess could both will it to become an impenetrable ''wall of force'' or make it disappear completely. Moreover, inside the temple, any Selûnite priest of sufficient rank could freely conjure a ''wall of moonlight'' among other spells.
