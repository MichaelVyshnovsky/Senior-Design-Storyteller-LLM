        "mainbody": "Lesser tree healing, known as tree nap to the church of Baervan Wildwanderer, was a spell that enabled its caster to rejuvenate by drawing upon the healing energies of a tree. As the name suggested, it was similar to but less potent than tree healing.\nIn its most common form, lesser tree healing cloaked its caster in an illusion resembling an appropriate part of a tree they were in direct contact with, such as an above-ground root, a thick branch, or a large burl. While this illusion was relatively easy to see through, detection did not necessarily interrupt the spell. While under the effects of the spell, the caster could draw life force from the tree over long periods of time, provided constant contact was kept and no major movements were made.\nAlthough this spell worked with any tree, oaks in particular enhanced its effect, and oaks inhabited by dryads or hamadryads even moreso.\nA variety of the spell found in the book Treasures of the Golden Hills hewed a lot closer to its \"greater\" counterpart, and enabled the caster to entirely hide within a tree (provided it could accommodate them in all dimensions), which granted the additional benefit of protection against environmental conditions. A downside of this version was that any major harm to the tree subject could expel and injure the caster, and sudden destruction often resulted in their death.\nBoth varieties of the spell required verbal components and the use of a divine focus, but whereas the common one made use of a drop of tree sap, the one found in Treasures of the Golden Hills had a somatic requirement instead.\nThe short story \"Baravan and Chiktikka Escape the Orc Army\" from Treasures of the Golden Hills chronicled the rarer variant of this spell."
