}}'''''Zajimarn's field of icy razors''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s and by [[cleric]]s with the [[Cold domain]]. This spell was created by [[Zajimarn]].

==Effects==
This spell caused razor-sharp ice crystals to form within its affected area, causing great harm to any creature caught in the area and even more so if they moved around. The deep cold of the icy razors also slowed the muscles and reaction time of living creatures.

The icy razors could be destroyed but the air within the area remained cold enough to still cause harm for the duration of the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[shuriken]] worth at least 50 [[gp]] to cast.
