Zajimarns field of icy razors was an evocation spell used by wizards and sorcerers and by clerics with the Cold domain. This spell was created by Zajimarn.
This spell caused razor-sharp ice crystals to form within its affected area, causing great harm to any creature caught in the area and even more so if they moved around. The deep cold of the icy razors also slowed the muscles and reaction time of living creatures.
The icy razors could be destroyed but the air within the area remained cold enough to still cause harm for the duration of the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a shuriken worth at least 50 gp to cast.
