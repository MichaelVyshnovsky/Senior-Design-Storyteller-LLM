'''''Skull & Crossbows''''' is  2{{nd}}–edition [[Dungeons & Dragons]] anthology for the [[Spelljammer Campaign Setting]] featuring 19 adventures.

{{Quote|Different worlds have different laws. But everywhere you go, you're going to find people who bend and break those laws and turn a healthy profit doing it. Whether sailing the high seas or the Flow, they are called pirates. 

It's these pirates that you've been hired to hunt. With letters of marque in your mapcase, your job is to track down and capture, alive or dead, some of the most dangerous characters in the known( and unknown) spheres.

Of course, not everyone in space is a pirate. You'll also meet Torgan Betz (a man famous for bending the laws, rarely breaking them), Tiktitik, the [[Thri-kreen]] crusader, " Thought Taker," the [[illithid]], and the feared [[Drow]] commander Teela Darkcloud. Even so they all have their personal agendas, and it's often hard to tell enemies from friends.

''Skull & Crossbows'' is an anthology of adventures for the Spelljammers campaign setting. This 64-page anthology easily follows Wildspace, but can be used in any existing AD&D Spelljammer campaign.}}
