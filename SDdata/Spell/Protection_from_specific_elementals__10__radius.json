        "Effects": "This spell was compromised of four sub-spells, each spell targeting a specific elemental. Each spell had to be memorized individually by the caster. Selected elementals were unable to get within 10 feet (3 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an elemental, nor ranged weapons.\n\nThe sub-spells protected against:\n* [[Air elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[djinn]] and [[invisible stalker]]s.\n* [[Earth elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[xorn]].\n* [[Fire elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[efreet]] and [[salamander]]s.\n* [[Water elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[triton]]s and [[water weird]]s.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]].\n\nThe material component was determined by what elemental the caster wished to defend against:\n* Air elemental: a smouldering ember from a fire.\n* Earth elemental: a small fan.\n* Fire elemental: a vial of water.\n* Water elemental: a handful of dirt."
