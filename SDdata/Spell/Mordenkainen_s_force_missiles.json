        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens force missiles was an uncommon evocation spell that created force spheres able to shoot out from the casters fingers.\nSomewhat experienced wizards could evoke a single powerful force missile into existence and fire it any foe that could be seen. The force missile would inflict damage to the initial target, then explode in a 3-foot (0.9 meter) radius, damaging all in the area. The exact amount of damage was proportional to the power of the caster. The missiles themselves were impossible to dodge or resist, but the explosion was possible to avoid.\nExtremely powerful wizards could evoke up to seven missiles. Each of these missiles could be fired at a single target, or multiple targets. The force globes could also shatter objects, particularly if they were delicately made. However, very sturdy objects, such as stone walls, would not be affected.\nThe production and casting of the magical force missiles was very loud, and somewhat bright.\nThe spell only required somatic and verbal components."
