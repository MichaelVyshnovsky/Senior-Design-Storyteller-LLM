The Giants Run Mountains were a range of mountains west of the Vilhon Reach in the Shining Plains. They were an outpost for the gold dwarves as of 1372 DR.
The mountains were the northern part of the greater Iltkazar Range, which extended all the way to the Shining Sea in the south.
Within the range lay Mount Dodild, beneath which the city of Cairnheim was located.
According to dwarven legend, the mountains were named after a battle near the end of the Giant Wars known as the Fall of Karlyns Vale, in which over 5,000 giants fell at the hands of dwarves from Shanatar.
By 1369 DR, the Twisted Rune had placed a magical gate in the area to allow for instantaneous movement to other locations.
As well as goblins and ogres, the emerald dragon Behrshimmer made its lair in the range.
 Breakback Pass  This pass in the mountains faced the famous Wailing Dwarf of the Troll Mountains.
 Lake of Snows  A rather placid lake situated somewhere in the eastern reaches of these mountains.
