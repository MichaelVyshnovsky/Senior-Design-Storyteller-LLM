'''''Graft flesh''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that allowed the caster to connect flesh onto a living [[humanoid]] recipient.

==Effects==
The recipient of ''graft flesh'' had complete control over whatever flesh or body part was [[graft]]ed to them as it literally became an extension of their body. However, the graft would radiate a faint aura of necromancy and might quickly deaden and fall off depending on the source of the flesh and the skill of the caster.

The spell had two main uses. The first use was to restore or replace a missing limb by grafting musculo-skeletal tissue onto the site of the lost limb. If the lost limb itself was available, it could be permanently reattached. If not, a limb could be harvested from a fresh corpse, however this would rot and fall off after several days.

The second use was to disguise the caster or another person using the flesh and skin of a fresh corpse. The recipient's face and body could be made to appear like that of the corpse, however this process had no effect on their voice, knowledge, physical strength, or sensory abilities. This disguise could last for several days before it deadened and dropped away.

==Components==
The spell had both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==History==
Some ''[[Staff of skulls|staves of skulls]]'' could be used to cast ''graft flesh''.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the "Lady Doctor" [[Ellandra Tolbert]] made use of ''graft flesh'' to conceal her burned and scarred face.
