        "mainbody": "Blood lust was an enchantment spell that granted a person or creature a heightened state of awareness and increased fortitude for a limited amount of time.\nWhen this spell was cast, an individual touched by the spells caster became immune to pain, illness and any fear-like effects. They gained strong feelings of confidence, as if their morale was completely unshakable.\nAdditionally, the recipient of blood lust gained a keen sense of smell. It was so heightened that it allowed an individual to track another being akin to a scent hound or a skilled outdoorsman.\nThe casting of blood lust required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe specifications of this spell were detailed in the Malarite relic, the Book of Fangs and Talons."
