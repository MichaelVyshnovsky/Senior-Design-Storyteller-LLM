        "mainbody": "'''''Blood lust''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that granted a person or creature a heightened state of awareness and increased fortitude for a limited amount of time.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, an individual touched by the spell's caster became immune to pain, illness and any ''[[fear]]''-like effects. They gained strong feelings of confidence, as if their morale was completely unshakable.\n\nAdditionally, the recipient of ''blood lust'' gained a keen sense of smell. It was so heightened that it allowed an individual to track another being akin to a scent hound or a skilled outdoorsman.",
        "Components": "The casting of ''blood lust'' required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell were detailed in the [[Malar]]ite [[relic]], the ''[[Book of Fangs and Talons]].''"
