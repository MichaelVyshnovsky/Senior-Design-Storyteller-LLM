'''''Delayed light''''' was a [[spell]] that was commonly used by [[alhoon]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a glowing light with the same luminescence as torchlight. The spell required triggering conditions, similar to ''[[magic mouth]]''. When the conditions were met, the light appeared. This was a long-term spell; it would still activate if conditions were met years after the spell was originally cast. The light was able to remove magical darkness.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a phosphorescent material and a spark from a fire or flint.
