        "mainbody": "'''''Breathe Earth''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that allowed [[wizard]]s to survive in harsh environments of complete earth and stone.",
        "Effects": "''Breathe earth'' allowed its caster to avoid suffocation in mundane situations such as avalanches or cave-ins, as well as on [[plane]]s such as the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] or [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals]]. It also allowed one to safely breathe in areas of semisolid matter, such as on the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Salt]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, casting this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of small green feather.\n\nThe duration of this spell varied with the skill of the caster, with the lowest possible duration being around 6 to 9 hours. The effects of ''breathe earth'' could be shared by the caster with other creatures by touching them, though in doing so the spell's duration would become divided evenly among them.",
        "History": "Around the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] traveling through the plane of [[Acheron]] received a [[spellbook]] from the [[duergar]] sage [[Gheldoin]] that contained a number of planar spells, including ''breathe earth''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|17}}"
