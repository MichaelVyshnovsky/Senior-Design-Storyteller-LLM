        "mainbody": "Breathe Earth was an alteration spell that allowed wizards to survive in harsh environments of complete earth and stone.\nBreathe earth allowed its caster to avoid suffocation in mundane situations such as avalanches or cave-ins, as well as on planes such as the Elemental Plane of Earth or Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals. It also allowed one to safely breathe in areas of semisolid matter, such as on the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Salt.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, casting this spell required a material component in the form of small green feather.\nThe duration of this spell varied with the skill of the caster, with the lowest possible duration being around 6 to 9 hours. The effects of breathe earth could be shared by the caster with other creatures by touching them, though in doing so the spells duration would become divided evenly among them.\nAround the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff traveling through the plane of Acheron received a spellbook from the duergar sage Gheldoin that contained a number of planar spells, including breathe earth."
