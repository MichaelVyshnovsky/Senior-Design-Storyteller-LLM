Lightning ring was a wizard spell from the school of evocation.
This spell created a ring of lightning that surrounded the caster at chest-height. The lightning ring would move with the caster and the caster could work other magic while the ring was active. The ring prevented all forms of lightning from harming the caster.
Lightning bolts shot from the ring twice per minute, harming any living targets they contacted. The caster could also decide to use all of the lightning rings energy at once, releasing eight lightning bolts to selected targets which ended the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a glass ring of any size and some animal fur to cast.
