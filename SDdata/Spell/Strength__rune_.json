        "mainbody": "'''''Strength''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that improved upon the physical skills of whoever wielded its inscribed object.",
        "Effects": "Those who wore the inscribed ''[[helmet]]'' or ''girdle'' would be granted a mild improvement to their strength. The duration of this effect was equal to the caster's level. Upon removal of the runed object this effect would instantly cease.\n\nIf a caster extensively studied this rune a second time, then the casted effect would improve a wearer's strength by twice as much.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Healing (rune)|healing]]''. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours and it needed to be inscribed upon either a ''helmet'' or ''girdle''."
