Beast tattoo was a divine spell granted to followers of the elven deity Fenmarel Mestarine, the Lone Wolf. It granted the caster a temporary boost to the characteristic associated with the creature represented by a tattoo on the casters body.
The caster had to have a tattoo on their body of a creature that was culturally associated with a particular characteristic. For example, if the casters culture believed that bears represented strength, then casting beast tattoo on their skin decoration of a bear granted them a boost in strength for one hour (longer for more experienced casters). A priest could not augment themselves beyond the best example of their kind. So for the strength example, the caster could not become stronger than the strongest non-augmented elf.
This spell require verbal and somatic components as well as the priests holy symbol to cast. A tattoo of a creature representing the desired characteristic had to exist on the casters body and it was not consumed in the casting of the spell.
