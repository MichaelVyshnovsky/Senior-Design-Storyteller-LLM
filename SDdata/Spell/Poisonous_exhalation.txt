'''''Poisonous exhalation''''' was a [[spell]] of the [[conjuration|conjuration school]] used by [[sorcerer]]s, particularly [[Sorcerer#Dragon Sorcerer|dragon sorcerers]].

==Description==
When it was cast, ''poisonous exhalation'' caused the sorcerer casting it to breathe out a billowing mist of poisonous gas that sapped the endurance of creatures caught within. Dragon sorcerers sapped their enemies further, to a degree dependent on their own physical strength. ''Poisonous exhalation'' was not particularly difficult to cast, requiring only a short rest from its user before it could be recast.
