Poisonous exhalation was a spell of the conjuration school used by sorcerers, particularly dragon sorcerers.
When it was cast, poisonous exhalation caused the sorcerer casting it to breathe out a billowing mist of poisonous gas that sapped the endurance of creatures caught within. Dragon sorcerers sapped their enemies further, to a degree dependent on their own physical strength. Poisonous exhalation was not particularly difficult to cast, requiring only a short rest from its user before it could be recast.
