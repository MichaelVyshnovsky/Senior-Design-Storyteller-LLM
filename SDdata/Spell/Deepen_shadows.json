        "mainbody": "'''''Deepen shadows''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[ninja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. It was very rarely found outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell discreetly darkened the area surrounding the ninja. The spell had the best affect in an enclosed space like a room or a cave. The darkness was unobtrusive and aroused little notice from others in the area. The spell could be detected with a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell. The spell attempted to darken a whole room and had a base area of affect of 10 feet by 10 feet (3 meters by 3 meters) that increased based on the ninja's skill. The spell had to cover the entire room to succeed. If it was attempted in a room that was too large, it failed.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[kuji-kiri]] hand gestures as the [[somatic component|somatic]] component."
