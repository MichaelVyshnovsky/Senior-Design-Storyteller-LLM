        "mainbody": "Deepen shadows was a common spell used by ninja in Kara-Tur. It was very rarely found outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell discreetly darkened the area surrounding the ninja. The spell had the best affect in an enclosed space like a room or a cave. The darkness was unobtrusive and aroused little notice from others in the area. The spell could be detected with a detect magic spell. The spell attempted to darken a whole room and had a base area of affect of 10 feet by 10 feet (3 meters by 3 meters) that increased based on the ninjas skill. The spell had to cover the entire room to succeed. If it was attempted in a room that was too large, it failed.\nThe spell required only kuji-kiri hand gestures as the somatic component."
