This burst of light caused temporary blindness in the affected creatures. \nThis spell required somatic, verbal, and a material component. The material component was pinch of either phosphorus or sulfur.\nThe spell was developed by the Red Wizards of Thay where it was considered a common spell. Otherwise, it was very rarely used."
