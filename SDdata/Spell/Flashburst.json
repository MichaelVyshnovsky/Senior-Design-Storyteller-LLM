        "mainbody": "Flashburst was a potent and dazzling spell, capable of disorienting and blinding its targets with a brilliant burst of light.\nWhen cast, the spell emitted a dazzling flash of light, automatically dazzling creatures within . This burst of light caused temporary blindness in the affected creatures. \nThis spell required somatic, verbal, and a material component. The material component was pinch of either phosphorus or sulfur.\nThe spell was developed by the Red Wizards of Thay where it was considered a common spell. Otherwise, it was very rarely used."
