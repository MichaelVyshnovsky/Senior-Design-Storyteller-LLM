'''Shugenja''' ({{Pronounce|shoo|gen|jah|refs=}}) (also spelled '''shukenja''') were wielders of [[divine magic]] who controlled elemental forces. In [[Shou Lung]], shugenja were called '''dang-ki''' ({{Pronounce|dahng|kee|refs=}}).

==Culture==
Unlike [[sohei]], shugenja were not bound to their [[monastery]] or temple, instead wandering the land. A new shugenja received training in a monastery. This training focused on meditation, ritual and self-defense. In Kara-Tur, shugenja performed a variety of services, including marriages, defeating evil spirits, funeral rites and purification rituals.

Shugenja lived by strict principles laid down by their religions. They took vows of poverty and had no connections to their family or clan or the caste systems found across Kara-Tur. They avoided violence and lived a life of discipline. 

==Abilities==
Shugenja were skilled spell-casters. They had limited training in martial arts or use of weapons, using their divine magic abilities to defend themselves or others. A shugenja can use their ''ki'' to protect themselves from physical and mental attacks.  

==Notable Shungenja==
* [[Ce-ishi]] was a healer at the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] in the town of [[Aru]] in [[Wa]], taking care of the infirmary of the temple.

* [[Takegai Yodori]] acted as a courier for [[Takegai Uezami]], the head of the council of state and a high-ranking member of the noble [[Takegai clan]] in [[Kozakura]].
