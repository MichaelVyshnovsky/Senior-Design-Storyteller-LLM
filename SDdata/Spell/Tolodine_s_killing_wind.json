        "mainbody": "Tolodines killing wind was a Netherese spell of epic magic, designed to kill huge numbers of creatures in a ruthless manner.\nThe killing wind caused a huge cloud of acidic vapors to billow forth from the caster, covering an area hundreds or even thousands of yards across and lasting for hours or potentially even whole days.\nThe killing wind had a gruesome cost to its casting, as it drained the life force from the wielder. It could gain even more potency if the caster offered more vital essence than necessary, but this carried the risk of the caster accidentally drawing their soul into the Negative Energy plane, killing them and dissolving their soul into nothingness. An undead caster instead merely found their essence trapped on the Negative plane.\nthumb|300px|Maniacal laughter while casting was optional.\nThis spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Tolodine in , one year before his death, as his crowning achievement. It was preceded by a long series of other gaseous spells, such as Tolodines cloudkill, Tolodines gust of wind, and Tolodines stinking cloud. It had the distinction of being the first epic spell developed by the Netherese. \nIt could no longer be cast after Mystra changed the rules governing magic after Karsuss Folly in the . A weaker, safer version of killing wind was developed, and was able to be used once more by the most powerful of wizards."
