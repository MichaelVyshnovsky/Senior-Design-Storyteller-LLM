Disarm was an evocation spell that caused someone to drop any hand-held weapons or items they were carrying.
When cast, disarm caused a minor telekinetic burst that knocked any items from the hands of the affected individual, launching them a number of feet away. This spell had no effects on rings or any other worn items that were not specifically carried.
In the city of Waterdeep, this spell was commonly taught to members of City Watch.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components.
