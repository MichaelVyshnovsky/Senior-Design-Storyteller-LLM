Bonebind, also referred to as bind undead or boneball,Dragon magazine #200 has this spell listed as a 6-level spell and Wizards Spell Compendium Volume One has it listed as a 5-level spell. was a necromancy spell used by wizards.
Bonebind caused undead corporeal targets to curl up into a ball. If more than one undead target was affected then they would clump together tightly. The undead remained fixed as if held in stasis, unable to move or use any special abilities. They would remain held in this manner until either the spell ended or the caster willed it, leaving plenty of time for the caster to roll the ball of undead off a cliff or into a fire or other such action. A vile necromancer could also use this spell to collect their undead servants and dispatch them directly into the midst of their enemy.
When used against stronger forms of corporeal undead, or any incorporeal undead, bonebind acted like a slow spell. This spell had no effect on living targets. Bonebind had several unique effects when used against specific types of undead. Vampires could be forced into corporeal form and trapped that way and unable to fly for the spells duration. Bonebind prevented a banshee from wailing and negated any aging from being touched by a ghost.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a bone from any creature to cast.
It was rumored that necromancers on Radole had ringed that planet with a large minefield of boneballs composed of skeletons in order to deter unexpected visitors.
