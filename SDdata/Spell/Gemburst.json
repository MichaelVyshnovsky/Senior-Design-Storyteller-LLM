        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to literally store a ''[[fireball]]'' within a valuable [[fire opal]]. To accomplish this the ''gemburst'' spell was cast upon the gem followed immediately by casting a ''fireball'' spell at the gem. The spell would fail if the ''fireball'' was not cast within one minute of casting ''gemburst''.\n\nThe active gem radiated a faint hint of [[evocation]] magic, but appeared to be a normal fire opal. Once triggered, the exploding opal struck all targets within a 20 foot (6 m) radius.\n\nTwo methods existed for triggering the ''gemburst''. The caster could select a command word at the time of the casting that would cause the gem to instantly explode. There was no range limit for this command word to work so long as the caster and gem were on the same plane. The other method involved the gem exploding when a certain set of circumstances was met. These could be as vague or specific as the caster wished. It should be noted that ''gemburst'' spells based upon a command word dissipated harmlessly if the caster died, but a ''gemburst'' spell based upon circumstances would continue to work after the caster's death.\n\nThe ''gemburst'' spell could be successfully dispelled. The spell would also fail if triggered within an ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' or similar \"magic-dead\" area.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, ''gemburst'' required fire opal worth at least 1,000 [[gold]] pieces to cast."
