        "mainbody": "Dire chant was a divine conjuration spell from the necromantic sphere that created a sense of impending doom.\nAny enemies of the caster within the area of effect felt the oppressive nature of the magic, hindering their combat abilities and their ability to resist the effects of other spells and magic. A dire chant lasted as long as the caster continued to chant. However, if used underground, the caster need only chant for one minute and the acoustics would carry the spell for ten minutes without the need for continued chanting.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast.\nThis spell was only granted to dragons by Null, the Death Wyrm."
