        "Description": "While each ''deck of many things'' was different, they held some common properties. The majority of decks found contained 13 cards, while approximately 1/4 of them held 22. They were typically made of [[vellum]] or [[ivory]], but could also be cast from thin sheets of metal. They were often kept in a small [[pouch]] or ornate box.\n\nThe cards were named and each was adorned with a unique portrait that shimmered with a radiance of power. A 13-card deck included the ''sun'', ''moon'', ''star'', ''throne'', ''key'', ''knight'', ''the void'', ''flames'', ''skull'', ''ruin'', ''euryale'', ''rogue'' and ''jester'' cards, while a 22-card deck added the ''vizier'', ''comet'', ''the fates'', ''gem'', ''talons'', ''idiot'', ''donjon'', ''balance'' and ''fool''.\n\nWhile usually a deck of cards, a ''deck of many things'' could, on the rare occasion, come in another form, such as a circle of twenty two doorways, or a twenty two sided die.",
        "Powers": {
            "Effects": "The following effects were known to afflict, benefit, or otherwise change whoever drew the card:\n\n* ''Euryale'': The image of the [[medusa]]-like creature permanently cursed them. This effect could only be reversed by a [[deity]] or the magic of ''the fates'' card.\n* ''Flames'': They earned the enmity of a formidable [[devil]] who sought their suffering and destruction. This hatred continued until they or the fiend died.In BGII:SoA this card summoned an aggressive [[balor]] and four hostile [[fire elemental]]s. Hostile action by the [[outsider]] was taken within one to twenty days of earning the enmity.\n* ''Jester'': Great intuition and expertise were bestowed upon them in a similar manner as if they drew the ''sun'' card, albeit to a lesser extent. In addition they could draw two additional cards beyond those that they previously declared.In BGII: SoA this card was replaced by ''erinyes'' that improved all their base attributes.\n* ''Key'': A rare [[weapon]], of a type with which they were proficient, appeared in the hands of the card's drawer.<ref group=\"note\">In BGII: SoA, the weapon was replaced by the ''[[Warder's Signet]]''.\n* ''Knight'': A powerful knight appeared and pledged their loyalty to them. This noble combatant believed that the fates had drawn them to that place and time.In BGII: SoA this card summoned four hostile [[demon knight]]s. This person and the drawer belonged to the same race and sex.\n* ''Moon'': They gained the ability to cast the powerful spell ''[[wish]]'' in one to three instances.In [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]] this card permanently increased their overall heartiness.\n* ''Rogue'': A person close to the drawer of the card, or even a powerful figure or organization, became hostile towards them, though their identity was unknown to the drawer. This hatred could only be alleviated by a deity's intervention or the spell ''wish''.In BGII:SoA this card placed them under the effects of ''[[dire charm]]'' for over 40 days. The person who hated the drawer did not reveal their hatred until the most opportune time to cause the most trouble to the object of their hatred.\n* ''Ruin'': They lost any and all wealth in their possession. While [[:Category:Magic items|magical items]] were not affected in this manner, [[gold]] and other valuables disappeared. Any businesses, investments, land, or other holdings were also lost along with any corresponding documentation.\n* ''Skull'': An avatar of death appeared before them. Before assaulting them with its [[scythe]], the skeletal reaper warned anyone nearby that they were to engage in this fight alone. Anyone slain by the avatar of death could not be ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' or otherwise brought back to life.In BGII: SoA the avatar of death was replaced by a ''death [[shade]]''. There was a chance of this card calling a [[jerul]] instead.<ref>{{Cite dragon/353/Volo's Guide: Outsiders of the Forgotten Realms|66}}\n* ''Sun'': They were granted tremendous insight and skill as if they were much more experienced in their travels. In addition, they were granted a single [[:Category:Wondrous items|wondrous item]] from anywhere throughout the Realms or other [[planes of existence]].\n* ''Star'': Two defining qualities of them were greatly and permanently enhanced. Such characteristics included their wit, intellect, fortitude, athletic ability, or other similar characteristics that helped define who they were as a person.\n* ''The Void'': Their body was incapacitated and their soul was transported into a random object located somewhere. The location of the object was revealed to anyone nearby. The effects of this card could not be reversed by a ''wish'' spell.In BGII: SoA this card ''[[disintegrate]]d'' the drawer.\n* ''Throne'': They became adept at influencing others to a heroic extent. Additionally some random keep located somewhere came into their rightful possession. However, the keep was infested with monstrous creatures that had to be expelled before it could be claimed. There were no recorded instances of any keeps appearing or having their ownership transferred by means of this magic.\n\n\n[[File:Deck of many things.png|thumb|255px|''Nine cards from the 22-card deck of many things'']]\n\nThese effects were imbued within the 22-card deck:\n\n* ''Balance'': Their [[alignment]] was reversed along the axes of both good versus evil and order versus chaos. No effects occurred if they were considered [[neutral]] or [[unaligned]].In BGII: SoA this card depicted a portrait of the deck's creator. After the portrait smiled at the drawer the deck faded into nothingness. Furthermore, if the drawer's actions did not meet the standards of the newly imposed ethical and moral outlook, the card's magic sapped the drawer's life energy.\n* ''Comet'': If they defeated the next hostile creature or group of individuals they encountered single-handedly they gained a great amount of insight from the battle. If this did not occur the card had no effect.In BGII: SoA this card granted permanent protection against fire.\n* ''Donjon'': They became imprisoned in a state of stasis within an extra-dimensional space somewhere in existence, in a manner similar to the spell ''[[imprisonment]]''. All of their clothes, possessions and belongings remained at the location where they drew the card. They remained there until were discovered and recovered, however they could not be located by any [[divination]] magic and only by a casting of ''wish''. Even if they previously declared, they drew no more cards. \n* ''Fool'': They lost understanding and competence in a manner opposite to those effects that were caused by the ''jester'' card. They drew another card from the deck, regardless of how many other draws they had declared.\n* ''Gem'': A great cache of valuable [[gem]]s appeared before them, in the form of 25 pieces of [[:category:jewelry|jewelry]] or 50 individual gem stones. The value of these riches totaled 50,000 [[gp]].\n[[File:Unexpected Windfall AFR.jpg|thumb|The Gem card.]]\n* ''Puzzle'' (also known as the ''Idiot'' card)\n* ''Sage'' (also known as the ''Vizier'' card)In BGII: SoA this card placed them under the effects of the spell ''[[mantle]]'' for two hours.\n* ''Talons'': Every magic item in their possession ''[[disintegrate]]d''. Any [[artifact]]s on their possession were not destroyed in this manner, but did vanish to some other location.In BGII: SoA this card permanently ''[[blind]]ed'' them.\n* ''The fates'': They gained the ability to undo the fabric of time and reality, completely erasing one event from their life as if it never happened (including the ''eurayle's'' curse). The effects of this card could be used immediately or anytime within their lifetime.\n\n[[File:Deck_of_many_things-4e.jpg|thumb|center|600px|''The complete ''deck of many things'', 22-card version.'']]"

        "History": "[[File:Creation of the Deck of Many Things.jpg|thumb|Istus creates the first Deck of Many Things in the multiverse]]\n[[File:Deck of hazards.png|thumb|''A set of deck of hazards from [[Zhentil Keep]], circa [[1373 DR]].'']]\nThe original ''deck of many things'' in the whole multiverse was created by the Greyhawk god of luck, Istus, after a human woman named Asteria made a deal with them to save her friend, the [[medusa]] Euryale. Due to the divine nature of the cards, from then on myriad versions, each slightly different, started manifesting across the multiverse.\n\nOn Toril, the original ''decks of many things'' were created by the ancient Empire of [[Netheril]]. Then, these decks were nothing but decks of game cards known as ''decks of hazards''. This casual deck-building game was played with slightly [[enchanted]] cards competitively. After the fall of Netheril, the magic contained in surviving decks steeped and swelled into the potent cards known across the Realms for their dangers and possible beneficial effects."
