        "mainbody": "Spectral hand was an arcane necromancy spell that summoned a ghostly appendage to do the casters bidding.\nThis spell used a bit of the casters life force to create a ghostly hand to behave as the caster desired. The spectral hand could be used to deliver touch spells with a greater chance of contacting the target. The caster would feel any damage caused to the hand which would also end the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nNecrophants of Velsharoon could cast this spell once per day."
