Healing sting was a spell used by druids.
When cast, the spell allowed the caster to absorb the life force of another creature. When the caster inflicted damage onto another creature, they absorbed the equivalent amount of life energy.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, five dead and dried wasps.
