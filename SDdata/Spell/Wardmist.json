        "mainbody": "'''''Wardmist''''' was a [[spell]] that created a permanent, magical mist in a set location. This mist lowered the range of regular vision within the affected area, protected it from [[magic]]al and [[psionic]] [[scrying]] and could provide guardians in the form of [[undead]] monsters.",
        "Effects": {
            "Guardians": "Upon designation of a region to be protected by ''wardmist'' the caster, or casters combining their effort, would enclose an space, hundreds of feet in area. Undead guardians could be linked to the affected area upon casting, being released from a stasis when intruders enter or linger in the area of the mist. These guardians included [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[bonebat]]s, [[watchghost]]s, [[wraith]]s, [[blazing bones]], [[helmed horror]]s or [[baneguard]]s."
        },
        "Magic": "If a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell was cast within a ''wardmist'' it would increase visibility within the area of affect. The only way to destroy the effects of the spell was through use of a ''[[wish]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "The material component for ''wardmist'' was a lump of [[silver]] larger than the fist of the caster, the silk of a [[phase spider]], powdered [[amber]] worth no less than 500 [[gp]]. Additional components would be required if ''contingencies'' or ''spell triggers'' were linked with its casting.",
        "Notable Uses": "The [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]] had a specially designed ''wardmist'' guarding the windows to the cells."
