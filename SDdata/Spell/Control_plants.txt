Control plants was a divine spell that granted the caster control over plants and plant creatures. It was known to druids as well as to clerics with access to the Plant domain.
The spell allowed the caster to exert direct control over one or more plant creatures for several minutes, although the plants would resist suicidal orders. Their actions had to be directed via verbal command, and the plants would obey regardless of whether they could understand the language. In the absence of any orders, the plants would avoid attacking the caster for the duration of the spell. At the end of the spells effect, the plant creatures reverted to their normal behaviors.
A weaker version of this spell was said to have broader effects. It granted the ability to communicate in simple terms with all manner of plant life&mdashincluding fungi, molds, and plantlike monsters such as shambling mounds&mdashas well as to command mundane plants to provide information, to clear or obstruct a path, or even to wrap around enemies (duplicating the effects of an entangle spell, and also serving as an effective counter to that spell). Commands could also be issued to plant creatures, although they had a chance of rejecting the casters influence.This spell underwent a major revision between 3rd edition and 3.5 edition in which it may have been either confused for or remixed with command plants.
The spell required somatic and verbal components as well as a divine focus.
