Mage armor, originally called General Maticks armor, was a common conjuration spell used by arcane casters to create an armor for themselves out of magical force.
Upon casting the spell, whomever the caster touched was enveloped in an invisible force field that protected the target in much the same way as mundane armor, yet without any of its penalties, such as restricted movement or weight. Because it was a force field, incorporeal creatures or objects could not pass through it. A later version required the touched target to be one who is not wearing armor, with the spell ending by the casters voluntary choice or the touched one wears armor again.
This magic force armor would last for at least an hour, its ultimate duration dependent on the power of the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required that the caster hold unto a fragment of cured leather while casting.
The spell was supposedly invented by the Netherese arcanist and warrior General Matick in  of the Golden Age of Netheril, but many scholars believed that he had only commissioned its invention.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast mage armor within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
The rock gnome sorcerer Norry Waywocket was known to carry a wand of mage armor on his smuggling operations in Cormyr in the 1370s DR.
