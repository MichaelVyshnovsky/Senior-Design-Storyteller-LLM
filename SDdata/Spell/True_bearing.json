        "mainbody": "True bearing was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell was a favorite of mariners who used it to determine the direction of a landmark. This could only be used to find the direction of places previously visited by the caster. Locations hidden by magic caused the spell to fail. This spell only worked on fixed objects and never living things. A wizard casting this spell needed to have 10 feet (3 meters) of water beneath their feet.\nThis spell required a pinch of iron filings to cast."
