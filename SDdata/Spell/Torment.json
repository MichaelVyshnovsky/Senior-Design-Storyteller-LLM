        "mainbody": "Torment was a powerful arcane alteration and evocation spell that forced obedience from a creature from another plane of existence.\nThis spell created a link between the caster and the target creature. The caster then continued to read from a specially prepared writing which caused the creature an increasing amount of discomfort and pain. These physical symptoms would continue until the creature submitted to the wizards complete control.\nThe special writing needed for this spell to function required the target creatures secret name.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a specially prepared writing to cast. The writings were penned with ink worth a small fortune.\nThis spell was created and used by Iggwilv."
