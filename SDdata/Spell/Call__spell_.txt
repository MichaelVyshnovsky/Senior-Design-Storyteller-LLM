'''''Call''''' was an [[arcane magic]] spell that was a [[southern magic]]{{Southernmagic}} variant of ''[[gate]]''. When cast, the spell drew the attention of a single named being native to the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Effects==
The caster had to be on the Prime Material plane and call the name of a resident of the same Prime Material plane or a parallel Prime (the spell could not traverse the [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal]] or [[Astral Plane]]s to reach other [[planes of existence]]). The target had the choice to ignore or acknowledge the summons. If the summons was accepted, they would instantly ''[[teleport without error]]'' to a spot chosen by the caster within a {{SIAdj|200|ft|long=yes}} radius. If the summons was rejected, the spell had no affect. In order to entice the target to accept, a ''[[demand]]'' spell could be used prior to casting ''call''. The caster was required to know the precise location of the being that was to be summoned.

The spell used by wu jen allowed the caster to summon any creature they knew by sight. Similar to the southern magic version, the wu jen was required to know the specific identity of the creature being called, usually by using the true name of a creature. The target creature needed to be on the same plane as the wu jen. The summoned creature was not compelled to aid or obey the caster. If the spell was used on a deity or member of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], the being often ignored the wu jen. 

==Components==
In addition to the [[somatic component]], the spell required the name, location, and a small wax figurine of the target being. The caster called out the name of the creature during casting.
