Entangle was a transmutation or alteration spell that caused plants to hinder and ensnare all creatures in the area of effect.
The transmutation version of this spell affected a circle of  radius. The alteration version affected a  cube. Both versions animated the vegetation to loop and twist around any creature in the area of effect. Grasses and weeds, bushes, vines, and trees reached out and ensnared them, holding them fast, or at least slowed them down. Victims of the spell had a chance to break free of the entanglement although the plants would attempt to re-capture anyone who broke free. Creatures assaulted by the local flora found it nearly impossible to attack, defend, or cast spells until they exited the area. Exceptionally large or strong creatures were less likely to be bothered by the writhing plants.
Verbal and somatic components, as well as the priests holy symbol or divine focus were required to cast this spell.
