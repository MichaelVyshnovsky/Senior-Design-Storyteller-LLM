        "mainbody": "Dominate person, also simply known as domination,\nCasting this spell on a person gave complete control of that person while on the same plane, unless the target managed to mentally resist. If successful, the caster could command the person to \"move there\", \"attack\", \"fetch\", etc., and the charmed person would attempt to follow his or her orders to the best of their ability. The spell could last for days if cast by a powerful spellcaster, and only those of very strong will could break the spell. The duration changed after the Second Sundering to a maximum of eight hours.\nOnly verbal and somatic components where needed for the casting of this spell.\nThe Netherese arcanist Prug was given the credit for the creation of this spell in . It was originally known as Prugs dominate.\nIn general only evil spellcasters used this spell. In many places, such as Waterdeep, the use of this spell was illegal and considered magical assault."
