        "mainbody": "The '''Twisted Tower of Ashaba''' was the home and seat of power of the lord and lady of [[Shadowdale]]. The tower, originally known simply as the Twisted Tower, took its name from the first [[human]] lord of the dale, the water wizard [[Ashaba]].",
        "History": "[[File:Ashaba-Twisted-Tower-Map.jpg|thumb|''Maps of the upper floors.'']]\n[[File:Ashaba-Twisted-Tower-Map-Dungeon.jpg|thumb|''Maps of the dungeon levels.'']]\n[[Drow]] began construction of the Twisted Tower in {{Yearlink|-2600}}, and completed it in {{Yearlink|-2549}}. It was retained by the drow, and expanded twice in the decades following {{Yearlink|-750}}.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-331}}, coronals [[Connak]] and [[Tannivh Irithyl]] broke through the Twisted Tower's defenses with their [[elf]] armies, and destroyed the drow within, although the drow captured the ''[[Warblade|Soldier's Blade]]'' in the process. The tower was handed over to good dark elves, and became a temple to [[Eilistraee]] within a hundred years.\n\n[[Josidiah Starym]], in his quest to reclaim the ''Soldier's Blade'', caused the Tower to fall temporarily in the {{YearlinkName|500}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|713}} during the [[Weeping War]], drow took advantage of the collapse of [[Myth Drannor]] and openly seized the Tower once more, refounding the Lands Under Shadow.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|906}}, the Tower's drow occupants, then led by marshal [[Azmaer Dhuurniv]], were besieged for a year, had their well poisoned by a [[human]] slave, and were forced to flee back to the Underdark. This allowed humans to conquer the Tower, and the water wizard [[Ashaba]] became the first lord of [[Shadowdale]]. After Ashaba merged with the river in the {{YearlinkName|940}}, the Twisted Tower was renamed to the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in his honor.",
        "Defenses": "The Twisted Tower of Ashaba had a [[mortar]] mixed with substances designed to block [[scrying]]."
