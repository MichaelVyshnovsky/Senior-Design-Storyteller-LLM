'''''Twitch''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a target creature to experience a brief muscle spasm in one of their extremities.

==Effects==
This cantrip was similar to the ''[[nod]]'' cantrip and had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. Unless the target creature resisted the magic of this spell, a non-torso body part suffered a tic or muscle contraction that was possibly annoying. This cantrip did not cause damage, break concentration, or force a loss of control of the targeted body partâ€”it was merely discomforting and noticeable by others.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster looked at and spoke the name of the body part (arm, leg, hand, foot, neck, head, ''etc.'') while making a small jerking motion with one hand.
