Aura of purity was an abjuration spell that created an aura of purifying energies.
The aura extended to  keeping non-hostile creatures from becoming diseased and granting them resistance to poison. The aura also instilled resistance to becoming blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, and stunned. The aura traveled with the caster and only lasted 10 minutes.
The spell only required a verbal component.
