It had to be cast before the intended spell. It was usually effective against mid-level magical resistance or barrier spells.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small knife or spike made from iron.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
