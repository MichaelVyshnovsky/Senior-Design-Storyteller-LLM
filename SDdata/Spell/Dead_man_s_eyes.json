        "mainbody": "Dead mans eyes was an arcane spell from the school of necromancy that allowed a wizard to kill with their eyes.\nThis spell turned the whites of the casters eyes black with the pupils reshaped into small white skulls. The caster could gaze at a single target at a time within , killing or harming them if they met the casters gaze. The deadly magic could be directed back at the caster if reflected by a mirror or other reflective surface.\nIn addition to somatic components, this spell required as material components a pair of glass marbles the same color as the casters eyes to cast.\nThis spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara."
