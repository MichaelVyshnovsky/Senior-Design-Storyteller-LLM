        "Effects": "This cantrip was similar to the ''[[scratch]]'' cantrip and had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. It caused one creature to experience a tickling in the nose that prompted a single sneeze to relieve the irritation. If the target managed to resist the spell, nothing happened.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster spoke the name of a breathing irritant (dust, pepper, ''etc.'') and touched their nose."
