        "Effects": "When ''ray of enfeeblement'' was cast, a coruscating beam was shot from the caster's hand at the target, at a close distance of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} or more. If it struck, the victim lost some of their strength, becoming much weaker, though they could not become completely paralyzed. The caster's experience determined the range and degree of strength lost. It could not be resisted, but the effect faded in a matter of minutes.\n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]], the caster merely had to point three curled fingers at the target. A stream of strange green mist arose the victim as their strength left their body if they could not resist. This did physical harm and left them feeling weak for several seconds.",
        "Components": "It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Hamring]] in {{Yearlink|-1294}} and was originally called ''Hamring's enfeeblement''."
