        "mainbody": "Ray of enfeeblement was a necromancy spell that sapped the strength of a target.\nWhen ray of enfeeblement was cast, a coruscating beam was shot from the casters hand at the target, at a close distance of  or more. If it struck, the victim lost some of their strength, becoming much weaker, though they could not become completely paralyzed. The casters experience determined the range and degree of strength lost. It could not be resisted, but the effect faded in a matter of minutes.\nFollowing the Spellplague, the caster merely had to point three curled fingers at the target. A stream of strange green mist arose the victim as their strength left their body if they could not resist. This did physical harm and left them feeling weak for several seconds.\nIt required verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Hamring in  and was originally called Hamrings enfeeblement."
