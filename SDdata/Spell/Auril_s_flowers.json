        "mainbody": "Aurils flowers was a divine magic spell available to priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It caused an explosion of sharp ice and small stones to burst from the ground in an area designated by the caster.\nThis spell had to be cast upon moisture-bearing ground within a range of 600 ft (183 m)&mdashit would not work on terrain that contained no moisture within 3 ft (91 cm) of the surface, such as a dry, sandy desert or solid rock. Higher level casters could extend the range even further and cause more damage. From the target point, all subsurface moisture in a 30 ft (9.1 M) radius instantly froze, causing a violent upwelling of ice and creating a soil-covered mound (known as a pingo). This action flung sharp ice shards and chunks of stone throughout the area, causing equal parts physical damage and cold damage. Creatures caught in this barrage could attempt to dodge the worst of it and, if successful, receive only half the damage.\nThe area affected by this spell became covered in dense rubble\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.\nCategoryTransmutation spells\nCategoryAurilian spells\nCategoryCleric spells\nCategoryDruid spells\ndjpubn42um5f2wdd7ms9m8mfxq39gab"
