Desert fist, also known as Fist of sand, was a spell used by wizards in the Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
When cast, this spell caused a parcel of sand to rise up and strike a target. The sand could be shaped like a fist, tentacle, or other bludgeoning objects. Only one target was selected when the spell was cast. The fist struck so hard that items carried by the target could be destroyed. The fist was also able to leap from the sand to strike targets in the air.
