}}'''''Desert fist''''', also known as '''''Fist of sand''''', was a [[spell]] used by wizards in the [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell caused a parcel of [[sand]] to rise up and strike a target. The sand could be shaped like a fist, tentacle, or other bludgeoning objects. Only one target was selected when the spell was cast. The fist struck so hard that items carried by the target could be destroyed. The fist was also able to leap from the sand to strike targets in the air.
