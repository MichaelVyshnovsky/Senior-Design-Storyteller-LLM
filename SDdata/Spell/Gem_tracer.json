        "mainbody": "Gem tracer was a powerful spell commonly used by dragons. \nThis spell was used to create a permanent link to an object or item by using a focus. The focus acted like a locate object spell but with unlimited range. It also allowed the creature holding the focus to scry the enspelled object. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a focus, a gem with a value of 100 gp or more.\nAccording to legend, this spell was created by the dragon whose hoard was first raided."
