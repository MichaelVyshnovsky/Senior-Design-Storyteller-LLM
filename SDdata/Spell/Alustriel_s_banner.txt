Alustriels banner was a wizard spell created by Alustriel Silverhand. This spell was popular among armies and mercenary bands for its battlefield practicality.
The spell created a banner of any desired size or shape to appear where the caster wished. The banner could even glow, illuminating the surrounding area similar to a light spell. The banner was accompanied by loud fanfare. The fanfare only lasted for a minute, but could be dismissed whenever the caster desired.
If present, the fanfare was a tune heard previously by the caster played by horns. Likewise, the banners decoration needed to be something seen by the caster at some point in their life.
This spell could be used to trick others into believing they were encountering a ghost or other watchful guardian. By far the most popular use of this spell was as a rallying call on the battlefield.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a real trumpet to cast. Acceptable substitutions for a trumpet included other horns or smaller models made from other materials.
