Faith armor was a divine spell that protected an individual from physical and magical attacks.
When this spell was cast, it surrounded the recipient in a translucent barrier that offered significant protection. For a limited time, it made them more resilient to physical attacks and protected them from spells that fell under a single school of magic or divine sphere.
The title of this spell was inscribed within the Helm of Helm and could be cast by utterance of its wearer.
In order to be cast, this spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as enough powdered obsidian to cover the casters hands.
