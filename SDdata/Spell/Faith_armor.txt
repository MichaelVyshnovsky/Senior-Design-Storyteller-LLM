==History==
The title of this spell was inscribed within the ''[[Helm of Helm]]'' and could be cast by utterance of its wearer.

==Components==
In order to be cast, this spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as enough powdered [[obsidian]] to cover the caster's hands.
