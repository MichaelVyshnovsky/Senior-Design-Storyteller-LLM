        "mainbody": "Belorigars Baldric was a spell that allowed a wizard to keep a few spells in abeyance, then unleash those spells at some point in the coming days.\nBelorigars Baldric, when cast, required a clear-cut gemstone of great value. It also required the caster to test their mettle against their own spellcasting in three different ways if either of the tests failed, the gemstone shattered and the spell was wasted. The caster could then cast a small handful of spells into a baldric, and then unleash them on a target within range, including themselves, with a simple act of willing it.\nWizards still argued on how to describe the baldric. What was known, however, was that it was undetectable and invisible until called into being by the caster. The baldric was largely considered to hang over their shoulders, and could only be scoured out by a wish, an imprisonment cast upon the bearer of the baldric, or Mordenkainens disjunction. The latter two sent its contents out in random directions.\nThe baldric increased in duration with the casters ability, lasting a minimum of 12 days unless special circumstances were involved. A baldric lasting 12 days could store two spells for every two days of its maximum duration, it could store an additional spell, until it reached 6 spells at 20 days. Afterwards, it would gain the ability to store one more spell at 24 days of duration. Baldrics lasting 22 days or more could also unleash two spells simultaneously. A baldric capable of lasting more than 24 days would not accept more than seven spells attempting to do so would destroy the baldric and cause it to unleash a wild surge.\nBelorigars Baldric probably came from early Netheril, or even earlier. It was an alternative to the mantle spell, with less passive and more active functions. Sages said such spells may have been the primary reason why wizards became people of influence, rather than being kept from their spells simply by restraining them or taking away their components. They also disagreed on whether the baldric was an alternative or an earlier version of the mantle. Liches and mages taught from ancient grimoires might know of different versions of this spell."
