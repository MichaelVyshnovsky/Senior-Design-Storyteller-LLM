This spell was crafted by the [[lich]] [[Shangalar]], when he was still a mortal [[tiefling]] [[wizard]] in [[Calimshan]].

==Component==
Along with a verbal and somatic component this spell required a tiny replica javelin made of any organic material, a fragment of bone and a drop of blood from the caster.
