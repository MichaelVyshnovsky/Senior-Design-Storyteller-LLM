'''''Planar call''''' was a powerful [[spell]] commonly used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
Using this spell, a wu jen summoned any creature from the planes. The creature was required to be known by the wu jen. There was a risk that a creature on another plane ignored the summons. If a powerful creature was summoned, such as a deity, they were not forced to respond, although some responded by their own volition. A successfully summoned creature was not under control of the wu jen and had the ability to return to their plane at their will.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, an incense and a piece of [[paper]].
