Planar call was a powerful spell commonly used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Using this spell, a wu jen summoned any creature from the planes. The creature was required to be known by the wu jen. There was a risk that a creature on another plane ignored the summons. If a powerful creature was summoned, such as a deity, they were not forced to respond, although some responded by their own volition. A successfully summoned creature was not under control of the wu jen and had the ability to return to their plane at their will.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, an incense and a piece of paper.
