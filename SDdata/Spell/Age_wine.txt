'''''Age wine''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] used by [[Lliiran]] [[priest]]s who committed themselves to [[wine]] production.

==Effects==
When the spell was cast by a [[cleric]], it brought the target container of wine to maturity and increased its quality and value within a single minute. The spell could target five gallons of wine within one yard from the caster. The effects of ''age wine'' were permanent and the volume of wine that could be aged increased with the cleric's magical power.

==Components==
''Age wine'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. The spell's material component was a single pinch of [[yeast]].

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''age wine'' spell was used by the [[hin]] winemakers and priests of [[Lliira]] [[Jolly Greenleaf]] and [[Brandywine Furfoot]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. Jolly committed his life to the art of winemaking and ran [[As the Vine Twines]] winery in the Bluff. Cleric Greenleaf learned of the Lliiran divine magic that helped with the production of wine from [[France]], a traveling cleric of Lliira, soon after the halfling found himself in Ravens Bluff.
