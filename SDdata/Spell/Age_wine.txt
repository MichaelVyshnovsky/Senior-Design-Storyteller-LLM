Age wine was a divine magic spell used by Lliiran priests who committed themselves to wine production.
When the spell was cast by a cleric, it brought the target container of wine to maturity and increased its quality and value within a single minute. The spell could target five gallons of wine within one yard from the caster. The effects of age wine were permanent and the volume of wine that could be aged increased with the clerics magical power.
Age wine required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. The spells material component was a single pinch of yeast.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, age wine spell was used by the hin winemakers and priests of Lliira Jolly Greenleaf and Brandywine Furfoot of Ravens Bluff. Jolly committed his life to the art of winemaking and ran As the Vine Twines winery in the Bluff. Cleric Greenleaf learned of the Lliiran divine magic that helped with the production of wine from France, a traveling cleric of Lliira, soon after the halfling found himself in Ravens Bluff.
