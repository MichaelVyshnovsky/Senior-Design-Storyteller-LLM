        "mainbody": "'''''Battering ram''''' was an uncommon [[evocation]] spell  used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s that duplicated the effects of a ''[[ring of the ram]]''.",
        "Effects": "For a matter of seconds, the caster's arm was surrounded with a translucent [[arcane]] force that appeared in the form of a ram's head over their hand. For the spell's duration the caster possessed great strength, comparable to that of a [[hill giant]] and could readily smash, break or otherwise damage people and creatures with their punch.\n\nAlternately, they could blast the force energy up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away in a direction of their choosing.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a focus, a carved horn from a ram.",
        "Notable Users": "This spell was readily available to guild members of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] as well as members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]]."
