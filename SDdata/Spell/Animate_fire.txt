Animate fire was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur, that created an animated object out of fire.
The spell allowed the caster to control the movement and temperature of fire. As long as there was combustible material, the fire could move in any direction. The amount of fire that could be controlled, and the range the fire would reach, was based on the casters skill level. The maximum distance the fire could spread was . The spell required deep concentration if the caster lost focus, the spell would expire.  
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components. A wu jen needed a handful of charcoal, soda ash, and sulfur to cast the spell.
