'''''Animate fire''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]], that created an [[animated object]] out of [[fire]].

==Effects==
The spell allowed the caster to control the movement and temperature of fire. As long as there was combustible material, the fire could move in any direction. The amount of fire that could be controlled, and the range the fire would reach, was based on the caster's skill level. The maximum distance the fire could spread was {{SI|9|ft|long=yes}}. The spell required deep concentration; if the caster lost focus, the spell would expire.  

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s. A wu jen needed a handful of [[charcoal]], [[soda ash]], and [[sulfur]] to cast the spell.
