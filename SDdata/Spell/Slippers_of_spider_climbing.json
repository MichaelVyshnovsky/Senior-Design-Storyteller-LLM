        "mainbody": "'''''Slippers''''' or '''''boots of spider climbing''''' were [[magic]]al boots that allowed their wearer to effortlessly walk on vertical surfaces, or upside-down along ceilings, leaving their hands free.",
        "Description": "Often unremarkable in appearance, ''slippers of spider climbing'' gave off a faint aura of [[alteration]] magic.",
        "Powers": "''Slippers of spider climbing'' were typically not effective on slippery surfaces, such as ice, or surfaces coated in oil or grease. Following the [[Spellplague]], ''boots of spiders climbing'' lost their sticky properties, instead merely enhancing their wearer's ability to climb. However, the item was reverted to its traditional state after the [[Second Sundering]].",
