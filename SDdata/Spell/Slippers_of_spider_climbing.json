However, the item was reverted to its traditional state after the Second Sundering.\n*Alley Cat Kordin, a cat burglar in Tantras, owned a pair. The slippers did little to aid his career, as he was both extremely clumsy and unlucky.\n*Orlpar Husteem, a Waterdhavian noble and drug dealer.\n*Paelinn, a drow divine seeker of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra.\n*Pallandra, a high priestess of Set in Mulhorand.\n*Ryngoth, an ex-Red Wizard of Thay and the High Priest of Kya Mordrayns cell of the Cult of the Dragon stationed in the Tower of Bones, Polyandrium of Myth Drannor in 1369 DR."
