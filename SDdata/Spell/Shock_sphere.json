        "mainbody": "'''''Shock sphere''''' is an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] learned early in the training of several [[wizard]]s that calls upon the elemental power of storm for its energy. When a wizard casts ''shock sphere'' she or he creates a sphere of crackling lightning and hurls it straight towards a spot within fifty feet of him or her. When the ''sphere'' reaches its destination it explodes, much like the simpler ''[[force orb]]'' spell, in a surge of electrical power over an area of five feet in diameter. A short rest is required of a wizard who seeks to recast the spell.",
