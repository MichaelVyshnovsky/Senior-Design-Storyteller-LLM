Blast of pain was a divine spell that inflicted a sharp pain into the target.
The spell could be cast by clerics who commanded the combat and necromantic spheres. It was commonly used priests of Ilmater.
As its name suggested, the blast of pain spell inflicted intense pain on its victim, via a ray of smoky grey light shot from caster to the target. A creature that succumbed to the pain was left writhing in agony for some time, their nervous system damaged, incapable of action or coherent thought, and senseless to goings-on around them. One who resisted was merely slowed both mentally and physically, and harmed less, before the spell passed.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
