        "mainbody": "nterdiction was a special divine abjuration quest spell from the law and wards spheres that negatively affected all enemies within the area of effect.\nEnemies within a cube measuring  on all sides found it more difficult to resist the effects of magic, more difficult to strike and harm their targets, and found themselves easier to be hit in combat. Allies of the caster experienced the exact opposite effects. Additional effects were possible through interdiction depending on the god who granted the spell. Negative and positive effects would stop affecting an enemy or ally several minutes after they left the area of effect.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind.\nThis spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power."
