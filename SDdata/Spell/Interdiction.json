        "mainbody": "'''''Interdiction''''' was a special [[divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[quest spell]] from the [[law sphere|law]] and [[wards sphere]]s that negatively affected all enemies within the area of effect.",
        "Effects": "Enemies within a cube measuring {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}} on all sides found it more difficult to resist the effects of [[magic]], more difficult to strike and harm their targets, and found themselves easier to be hit in combat. Allies of the caster experienced the exact opposite effects. Additional effects were possible through ''interdiction'' depending on the [[god]] who granted the spell. Negative and positive effects would stop affecting an enemy or ally several minutes after they left the area of effect.",
        "Components": "This spell did not require [[spell component]]s of any kind.",
        "History": "This spell was used by [[druid]]s who served [[Moander]] during the height of ancient [[Netheril]]'s power."
