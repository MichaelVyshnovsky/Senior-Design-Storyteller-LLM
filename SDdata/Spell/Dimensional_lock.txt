'''''Dimensional lock''''' was a [[spell]] that prevented extra-dimensional travel.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell prevented extra-dimensional travel and teleportation within an area with a {{SI|15|ft}} radius. The spell did not affect an astral or ethereal form already within the area. It also did not prevent extra-planar perception. If a summoned extra-dimensional creature was slain while within the affected area, the spell did not interfere with their return to their home plane.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
