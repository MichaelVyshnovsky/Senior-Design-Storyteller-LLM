        "mainbody": "Temporal anomaly was a spell used by clerics of Labelas Enoreth.\nWhen cast, this spell created ripple in time. It caused physical effects without a physical cause. For example, the caster could cause a throwing dagger to appear in a targets chest as out of nowhere. While casting, the caster actually enters an alternate timestream where they committed the desired action.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Labelas Enoreth and a ruby, crushed into a powder, with a value of at least 1,000 gp."
