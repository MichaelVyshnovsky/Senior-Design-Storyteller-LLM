Mirage was a minor illusion cantrip that initiate illusionists could learn. It covered a small area with an image of some other place of which the caster was familiar.
The target of this cantrip had to be within  of the caster and the imaginary scene could fill two  cubes in any contiguous orientation. The target area had to be relatively flat and empty to facilitate the illusion, and the scene created had to be from the casters memory of a real place they had seen. The spell was immediately canceled if it was touched by another being, or subjected to dispel illusion or dispel magic. Otherwise, the illusion remained steady as long as the caster could maintain concentration, which became increasingly difficult every minute and impossible after twenty minutes.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. A descriptive word or two was spoken while a hand was waved as if parting a curtain that hid the desired scene.
