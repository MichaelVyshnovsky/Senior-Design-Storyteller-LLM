'''''Mirage''''' was a minor [[illusion]] [[cantrip]] that initiate [[illusionist]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It covered a small area with an image of some other place of which the caster was familiar.

==Effects==
The target of this cantrip had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and the imaginary scene could fill two {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} cubes in any contiguous orientation. The target area had to be relatively flat and empty to facilitate the illusion, and the scene created had to be from the caster's memory of a real place they had seen. The spell was immediately canceled if it was touched by another being, or subjected to ''[[dispel illusion]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]''. Otherwise, the illusion remained steady as long as the caster could maintain concentration, which became increasingly difficult every minute and impossible after twenty minutes.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. A descriptive word or two was spoken while a hand was waved as if parting a curtain that hid the desired scene.
