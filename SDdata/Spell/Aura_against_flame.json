        "mainbody": "'''''Aura against flame''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that protected against and extinguished natural and magical fires.",
        "Effects": "This spell created an aura of blue mist that surrounded the [[cleric]]. The mist would absorb damage from fire and would extinguish any non-magical flames coming in contact with it. Whether or not magical flames would be snuffed out depended on the divine power of the caster. If successful at extinguishing magical flame, both the aura and the fire would be dispelled. The aura of mist could also dispel magical fire attacks made against the caster.\n\nThe effects of the aura would last from two minutes or longer for powerful clerics.",
        "Components": "This spell required clerical hand motions and spoken words to create the aura.",
        "History": "''Aura against flame'' was originally created by the goddess [[Eldath]] for her followers."
